    "in brane - world ( bw ) models @xcite , the possibility that the gravity scale is much lower than the planck scale and possibly close to the tev range can give rise to interesting observable effects at present or near experiments @xcite .",
    "the main idea that defines the bw scenario is that the standard model ( sm ) particles are restricted to a three - dimensional hypersurface or 3-brane , whereas the gravitons can propagate along the whole bulk space ( see for example @xcite for a particular construction ) .",
    "since rigid objects do not exist in relativistic theories , it is clear that brane fluctuations must play an important role in this framework @xcite .",
    "this fact turns out to be particularly true when the brane tension scale @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the brane tension ) is much smaller than the @xmath2 dimensional or fundamental gravitational scale @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the only relevant low - energy modes of the bw scenarios are the sm particles and branons which are the quantized brane oscillations .",
    "indeed branons can be understood as the ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the bulk space produced by the presence of the brane .",
    "the branon properties allow to solve some of the problems of the brane - world scenarios such as the divergent virtual contributions from the kaluza - klein tower at the tree level or non - unitarity of the graviton production cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the sm - branon low - energy effective lagrangian reads @xcite : @xmath5 we see that branons interact by pairs with the sm energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this means that they are stable particles . on the other hand ,",
    "their couplings are suppressed by the brane tension @xmath6 , i.e. they are weakly interacting .",
    "these features make them natural dark matter @xcite candidates ( see @xcite for updated reviews on cosmology and dark matter ) .",
    "the branon signals in colliders depend on their number @xmath7 , the brane tension scale @xmath0 , and their masses @xmath8 . from the effective action given in the equation ( 1 )",
    ", one can calculate the relevant cross - sections for different branon searches .",
    "the single photon channel and the monojet production are the more interesting ones .",
    "the main results in relation with this analysis are presented in table i , where one can find not only the present restrictions coming from hera , tevatron and lep - ii but also the prospects for future colliders like ilc , lhc or clic @xcite .",
    "in addition to direct production and the corresponding missing energy signatures , branons can also give rise to new effects through radiative corrections . by integrating out the branon fields in the action coming from @xmath9 it",
    "is possible to obtain an effective action for the sm particles which includes the effect produced by branon loops . at the level of two - point functions , branon loops result only in a renormalization of the sm particle masses which is not observable .",
    "however new couplings appear which can be described by an effective lagrangian @xcite whose more relevant terms are : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the cutoff setting the limit of validity on the effective description of branon and sm dynamics used here .",
    "this new parameter appears when dealing with branon radiative corrections since the lagrangian in ( [ lag ] ) is not renormalizable .",
    "when the branon mass @xmath8 is not small compared with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 have much more involved definitions , which will be given elsewhere @xcite .    an effective lagrangian similar to the one in ( [ eff ] ) was obtained in @xcite by integrating at the tree level the kaluza - klein modes of gravitons propagating in the bulk and some of its phenomenological consequences where studied there .",
    "thus it is easy to translate some of the results from these references to the present context .",
    "for example one of the most relevant contributions of branon loops to the sm particle phenomenology could be the four - fermion interactions appearing in ( [ eff ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ loop ] ) or fermion pair annihilation into two gauge bosons .",
    "c c c    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "electroweak precision measurements are very useful to constrain models of new physics .",
    "the so called oblique corrections ( the ones corresponding to the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 two - point functions ) use to be described in terms of the @xmath20 @xcite or the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters @xcite .",
    "the first order correction coming from the kaluza - klein gravitons in the add models for rigid branes to the parameter : @xmath23 was computed in @xcite . translating this result to our context as in the previous section",
    "we find : @xmath24    the experimental value of @xmath25 obtained from lep @xcite is @xmath26 .",
    "this value is consistent with the sm prediction for a light higgs @xmath27 gev at 95 % c.l . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are one order of magnitud smaller @xcite and therefore , we can estimate the constraints for the branon contribution at 95 % c.l . as @xmath28 .",
    "thus it is possible to set the bound : @xmath29 this result has a stronger dependence on @xmath14 ( @xmath30 ) than the interference cross section between the branon and sm interactions ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore , the constraints coming from this analysis are complementary to the previous ones .",
    "a further constraint to the branon parameters can be obtained from the @xmath32 anomalous magnetic moment . the first branon contribution to this parameter",
    "can be obtained from a one loop computation with the lagrangian given by ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "the result for the kk graviton tower was first calculated by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite in a different way and can be written as :    @xmath33    which for the branon case can be written as : @xmath34 this result depends on the cut - off @xmath14 in the same way as the electroweak precision parameters .",
    "however the experimental situation is a little different . in a sequence of increasingly more precise measurements ,",
    "the 821 collaboration at the brookhaven alternating gradient syncrotron has reached a fabulous relative precision of 0.5 parts per million in the determination of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "these measurements provide a stringent test not only of new physics but also to the sm . indeed , the present result is only marginally consistent with the sm . taking into account the @xmath36 collisions to calculate the @xmath37 spectral functions ,",
    "the deviation with respect to the sm prediction is at @xmath38 standard deviations @xcite . in particular :",
    "using equation ( [ gb ] ) we can estimate the _ preferred _ parameter region for branons to provide the observed difference : @xmath40 we observe that the correction to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is in the right direction and that it is possible to avoid the present constraints and improve the observed experimental value by the e821 collaboration .",
    "there are two interesting comments related to these results .",
    "first if there is new physics in the muon anomalous magnetic moment and this new physics is due to branon radiative corrections , the phenomenology of these particles should be observed at the lhc and in a possible future ilc ( see table [ future ] ) . in particular , the lhc should observe an important difference in the channels : @xmath41 and @xmath42 with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "the ilc should observe the most important effect in the process : @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , it is interesting to note that the same physics that could explain the dark matter content of the universe could also explain the magnetic moment deficit of the muon .",
    "in fact , as we show below , the above branon models with order of magnitude masses between @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 tev present the total non baryonic dark matter abundance observed by different experiments @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the first branon signals at colliders would be associated to the radiative corrections described in this section @xcite and not to the direct production studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "the potential wimp nature of branons means that these new particles are natural dark matter candidates . in @xcite",
    "the relic branon abundance has been calculated in two cases : either relativistic branons at freeze - out ( hot - warm ) or non - relativistic ( cold ) , and assuming that the evolution of the universe is standard for @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ mother ] ) . furthermore , if the maximum temperature reached in the universe is smaller than the branon freeze - out temperature , but larger than the explicit symmetry breaking scale , then branons can be considered as massless particles decoupled from the rest of matter and radiation . in such a case , branons can act as nonthermal relics and , in the particular case in which the total number of dimensions is six , it is possible to relate the cosmic coincidence problem with the existence of large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "if branons make up the galactic halo , they could be detected by direct search experiments from the energy transfer in elastic collisions with nuclei of a suitable target . from fig .",
    "[ direct ] we see that if branons constitute the dominant dark matter component , they could not be detected by present experiments such as dama , zeplin 1 or edelweiss .",
    "however , they could be observed by future detectors such as cresst ii , cdms or genius @xcite .",
    "branons could also be detected indirectly : their annihilations in the galactic halo can give rise to pairs of photons or @xmath47 which could be detected by @xmath19-ray telescopes such as magic or glast or antimatter detectors ( see @xcite for an estimation of positron and photon fluxes from branon annihilation in ams ) .",
    "annihilation of branons trapped in the center of the sun or the earth can give rise to high - energy neutrinos which could be detectable by high - energy neutrino telescopes such as amanda , icecube or antares .",
    "these searches complement those already commented in high - energy particle colliders ( both in @xmath47 and hadron colliders @xcite ) in which real ( see fig . [ mother ] ) and virtual branon effects could be measured .",
    "finally , quantum fluctuations of branon fields during inflation can give rise to cmb anisotropies through their direct contribution to the induced metric ( work is in progress in these directions ) .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the main features of branon physics .",
    "we have considered their main phenomenological signals parametrized in terms of the branon mass , the brane tension scale and the effective theory cutoff scale . at the tree level ,",
    "the most important signals come from missing energy and momentum events in single photon , single z and monojet processes in colliders . at one - loop level ,",
    "the most interesting processes are those involving new four fermion interactions and finally , at the two - loop level , the electroweak precision measurements and the muon anomalous magnetic moment can also set bounds on the model parameters .",
    "we have also considered the limits coming from cosmology due to the wimp - like nature of branons .",
    "this , in turn , ensures the existence of a relic abundance of branons , which could make up the galactic haloes .",
