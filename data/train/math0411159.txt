    "in this paper , we consider lam differential operators @xmath3 whose solutions are algebraic over @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is a complex number with @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( so - called degree parameter ) is a rational number , and @xmath8 is the accessory parameter .",
    "the possible finite projective monodromies of @xmath0 were studied by baldassarri , chiarellotto , and dwork , and recently by beukers , dahmen , licanu , van der waall , and zapponi .",
    "one of the most remarkable results is that there are at most finitely many equivalence classes of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath9 and fixed finite monodromy group .",
    "this was first done by chiarellotto  @xcite , and later shown by licanu by using the notion of grothendieck s dessins denfants  @xcite . for details of the theory of grothendieck s dessins denfants ,",
    "see  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ". moreover , chiarellotto and licanu got the explicit formula for the number of equivalence classes with projective dihedral monodromy of order @xmath10 for the case @xmath11 , which has been generalized more recently by dahmen  @xcite for arbitrary @xmath7 .",
    "they translated the counting problem for the number of equivalence classes of lam operators into that for the number of the dessins compatible with the ramification data of belyi morphisms which pull - back hypergeometric operators into the lam operators .",
    "this strategy is based on the klein s theorem , which claims that a second order fuchsian differential operator with finite projective monodromy is a rational pull - back of hypergeometric operator in the  _ basic schwarz list _ \" .    to carry out this program ,",
    "the method of grothendieck s dessins denfants by litcanu and dahmen provides a powerful tool .",
    "baldassarri determined the possible finite projective monodromy groups of @xmath0  @xcite , but recently , licanu got the same results and the necessary conditions for @xmath7 to have fixed possible finite projective monodromy group by using the notion of grothendieck s dessins denfants  @xcite . by  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "the possible finite projective monodormy groups are dihedral group @xmath12 , octahedral group @xmath13 , or icosahedral group @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , licanu  @xcite proves the following theorem :    [ litcanu ]    @xmath15 if the projective monodromy group of lam operator @xmath0 is dihedral , then @xmath16    @xmath17 if the projective monodromy group of lam operator @xmath0 is octahedral , then @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath22 there is no lam operator with projective tetrahedral monodromy .    the proof of this theorem is based on the analysis of the belyi morphism which pull - backs the hypergeometric operator into the lam operator , as well as the combinatorial data of the corresponding dessin .",

    "if we replace @xmath7 by @xmath25 , it is easy to see that @xmath26 .",

    "thus we may assume @xmath29 .",
    "in this situation , the following theorem gives the existence of lam operators @xmath30 with projective octahedral monodromy and projective icosahedral monodromy for each @xmath7 as in theorem [ litcanu ] ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) :    \\(1 ) _ for each _",
