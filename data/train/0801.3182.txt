    "identifying the physical processes that determine the masses of stars and their statistical distribution , the initial mass function ( imf ) , is a fundamental problem in star - formation research .",
    "it is central to much of modern astrophysics , with implications ranging from cosmic re - ionisation and the formation of the first galaxies , over the evolution and structure of our own milky way , down to the build - up of planets and planetary systems . near the sun",
    "the number density of stars as a function of mass has a peak at a characteristic stellar mass of a few tenths of a solar mass , below which it declines steeply , and for masses above one solar mass it follows a power - law with an exponent @xmath0 . within a radius of several kpc this distribution shows surprisingly little variation ( salpeter 1955 ; scalo 1998 ; kroupa 2001 ; kroupa 2002 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "this has prompted the suggestion that the distribution of stellar masses at birth is a truly universal function , which often is referred to as the salpeter imf , although note that the original salpeter ( 1955 ) estimate was a pure power - law fit without characteristic mass scale .",
    "the initial conditions in star forming regions can vary considerably , even in the solar vicinity . if the imf were to depend on the initial conditions , there would be no reason for it to be universal .",
    "therefore a derivation of the characteristic stellar mass that is based on fundamental atomic and molecular physics would be highly desirable . in this proceedings contribution",
    "we argue that indeed the thermodynamic properties of the star - forming cloud material determine the characteristic mass scale for fragmentation and subsequent stellar birth .",
    "the thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a result of the balance between heating and cooling processes , which in turn are determined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances .",
    "the derivation of a characteristic stellar mass can thus be based on quantities and constants that depend solely on the chemical abundances in a molecular cloud",
    ". it also explains why deviations from the `` standard '' mode of star formation are likely to occur under extreme environmental conditions such as those occurring in the early universe or in circum - nuclear starburst regions .",
    "stars and star clusters form through the interplay between self - gravity on the one hand and turbulence , magnetic fields , and thermal pressure on the other ( for recent reviews see larson 2003 ; mac  low & klessen 2004 ; ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "supersonic turbulence , even if it is strong enough to counterbalance gravity on global scales , will usually _ provoke _ local collapse .",
    "turbulence establishes a complex network of interacting shocks , where converging shock fronts generate clumps of high density .",
    "these density enhancements can be large enough for the fluctuations to become gravitationally unstable and collapse , which can occur when the local jeans length becomes smaller than the size of the fluctuation .",
    "however , the fluctuations in turbulent velocity fields are highly transient .",
    "the random flow that creates local density enhancements can disperse them again . for local collapse to actually result in",
    "the formation of stars , jeans - unstable shock - generated density fluctuations must collapse to sufficiently high densities on time scales shorter than the typical time interval between two successive shock passages . only then",
    "are they able to ` decouple ' from the ambient flow and survive subsequent shock interactions .",
    "the shorter the time between shock passages , the less likely these fluctuations are to survive . hence , the timescale and efficiency of protostellar core formation depend strongly on the wavelength and strength of the driving source as well as on the dynamic response of the gas , as defined by the equation of state , i.e. the balance between heating and cooling processes .",
    "the velocity field of long - wavelength turbulence is found to be dominated by large - scale shocks which are very efficient in sweeping up molecular cloud material , thus creating massive coherent structures .",
    "when a coherent region reaches the critical density for gravitational collapse , its mass typically exceeds the local jeans limit by far . inside the shock compressed region ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is much smaller than in the ambient turbulent flow and the situation is similar to localized turbulent decay .",
    "these are the conditions for the formation of star clusters .",
    "the efficiency of turbulent fragmentation is reduced if the driving wavelength decreases . when energy is inserted mainly on small spatial scales ,",
    "the network of interacting shocks is very tightly knit , and protostellar cores form independently of each other at random locations throughout the cloud and at random times .",
    "individual shock - generated clumps have lower mass and the time interval between two shock passages through the same point in space is small . collapsing cores are easily destroyed again and the resulting mass spectrum shows deviations from the observed imf .",
    "all this points toward interstellar gas clouds being driven on large scales .",
    "altogether , stellar birth is intimately linked to the dynamic behavior of the parental gas cloud , which governs when and where star formation sets in .",
    "the chemical and thermodynamic properties of interstellar clouds play a key role in this process .",
    "in particular , the value of the polytropic exponent @xmath1 , when adopting an eos of the form @xmath2 , strongly influences the compressibility of density condensations as well as the temperature of the gas .",
    "the eos thus determines the amount of clump fragmentation , and so directly relates to the imf ( vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "1996 ) with values of @xmath1 larger than unity leading to little fragmentation and high mass cores ( li , klessen , & mac  low 2003 ; jappsen et al .",
    "the stiffness of the eos in turn depends strongly on the ambient metallicity , density and infrared background radiation field produced by warm dust grains .",
    "the eos thus varies considerably in different galactic environments ( see spaans & silk 2000 , 2005 for a detailed account ) .",
    "early studies of the balance between heating and cooling processes in collapsing clouds predicted temperatures of the order of @xmath3k to @xmath4k , tending to be lower at the higher densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their dynamical collapse calculations , these and other authors approximated this somewhat varying temperature by a simple constant value , usually taken to be @xmath3k .",
    "nearly all subsequent studies of cloud collapse and fragmentation have used a similar isothermal approximation . however , this approximation is actually only a somewhat crude one , valid only to a factor of 2 , since the temperature is predicted to vary by this much above and below the usually assumed constant value of @xmath3k . given the strong sensitivity of the results of fragmentation simulations like those of @xcite to the assumed equation of state of the gas , temperature variations of this magnitude may be important for quantitative predictions of stellar masses and the imf .    as can be seen in fig .  2 of @xcite , observational and theoretical studies of the thermal properties of collapsing clouds both indicate that at densities below about @xmath5 , roughly corresponding to a number density of @xmath6 , the temperature generally decreases with increasing density . in this low - density regime , clouds are externally heated by cosmic rays or photoelectric heating , and they are cooled mainly by the collisional excitation of low - lying levels of c@xmath7 ions and o atoms ; the strong dependence of the cooling rate on density then yields an equilibrium temperature that decreases with increasing density .",
    "the work of @xcite , which assumes that photoelectric heating dominates , rather than cosmic ray heating as had been assumed in earlier work , predicts a very similar trend of decreasing temperature with increasing density at low densities .",
    "the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of @xcite also produce a similar result , although in this case the point - to - point scatter is larger .",
    "the resulting temperature - density relation can be approximated by a power law with an exponent of about @xmath8 , which corresponds to a polytropic equation of state with @xmath9 .",
    "the observational results of @xcite shown in fig .  2 of @xcite suggest temperatures rising again toward the high end of this low - density regime , but those measurements refer mainly to relatively massive and warm cloud cores and not to the small , dense , cold cores in which low - mass stars form .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , the temperatures of these cores are typically only about @xmath10k at a density of @xmath11 , consistent with a continuation of the decreasing trend noted above and with the continuing validity of a polytropic approximation with @xmath12 up to a density of at least @xmath11 .    at higher densities",
    ", atomic line cooling becomes less effective as the cooling rates start to reach their local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) limits and as the line opacities grow larger .",
    "consequently , at densities above @xmath5 the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust grains , which then control the temperature by their far - infrared thermal emission . in this high - density regime ,",
    "dominated thermally by the dust , there are few direct temperature measurements because the molecules normally observed freeze out onto the dust grains , but most of the available theoretical predictions are in good agreement concerning the expected thermal behavior of the gas @xcite",
    ". the balance between compressional heating and thermal cooling by dust results in a temperature that increases slowly with increasing density , and the resulting temperature - density relation can be approximated by a power law with an exponent of about @xmath13 , which corresponds to @xmath14 . between the low - density and the high - density regimes , the temperature is predicted to reach a minimum of @xmath15k at a density of about @xmath16 , at which point the jeans mass is about @xmath17 .",
    "the actual minimum temperature reached is somewhat uncertain because observations have not yet confirmed the predicted very low values , but such cold gas would be very difficult to observe ; various efforts to model the observations have suggested central temperatures between @xmath18k and @xmath3k for the densest observed prestellar cores , whose peak densities may approach @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a power - law approximation to the equation of state with @xmath20 is expected to remain valid up to a density of about @xmath21 , above which increasing opacity to the thermal emission from the dust causes the temperature to begin rising much more rapidly , resulting in an `` opacity limit '' on fragmentation that is somewhat below @xmath22 @xcite . adopting the piecewise polytropic equation of state outlined above , jappsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the changing @xmath1 from a value below unity to one somewhat above unity at a critical density @xmath23 influences the number of protostellar objects .",
    "if the critical density increases then more protostellar objects form but the mean mass decreases .",
    "consequently , the peak of the resulting mass spectrum moves to lower masses with increasing critical density .",
    "this spectrum not only shows a pronounced peak but also a powerlaw tail towards higher masses .",
    "its behavior is thus similar to the observed imf .",
    "a simple scaling argument based on the jeans mass @xmath24 at the critical density @xmath23 leads to @xmath25 .",
    "if there is a close relation between the average jeans mass and the characteristic mass of a fragment , a similar relation should hold for the expected peak of the mass spectrum .",
    "the simulations by jappsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) qualitatively support this hypothesis , but find a weaker density dependency @xmath26",
    "the formation of the first and second generations of stars in the early universe has far - reaching consequences for cosmic reionization and galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the physical processes that govern stellar birth in a metal - free or metal - poor environment , however , are still very poorly understood . numerical simulations of the thermal and dynamical evolution of gas in primordial protogalactic halos indicate that the metal - free first stars , the so called population iii , are expected to be very massive , with masses anywhere in the range 20@xmath27 @xcite , much larger than the characteristic mass scale found in the local imf .",
    "this means that at some stage of cosmic evolution there must have been a transition from primordial , high - mass star formation to the `` normal '' mode of star formation that dominates today .",
    "the discovery of extremely metal - poor subgiant stars in the galactic halo with masses below one solar mass @xcite indicates that this transition occurs at abundances considerably smaller than the solar value . at the extreme end ,",
    "these stars have iron abundances less than @xmath28z@xmath29 , and carbon or oxygen abundances that are still @xmath30 the solar value .",
    "these stars are thus strongly iron deficient , which could be due to unusual abundance patterns produced by enrichment from pair - instability supernovae @xcite from population iii stars or due to mass transfer from a close binary companion @xcite .",
    "there are hints for an increasing binary fraction with decreasing metallicity for these stars @xcite .",
    "if metal enrichment is the key to the formation of low - mass stars , then logically there must be some critical metallicity @xmath31 at which the formation of low mass stars first becomes possible .",
    "however , the value of @xmath31 is a matter of ongoing debate .",
    "some models suggest that low mass star formation becomes possible only once atomic fine - structure line cooling from carbon and oxygen becomes effective @xcite , setting a value for @xmath32 at around @xmath33 .",
    "another possibility is that low mass star formation is a result of dust - induced fragmentation occurring at high densities , and thus at a very late stage in the protostellar collapse @xcite . in this model , @xmath34 , where much of the uncertainty in the predicted value results from uncertainties in the dust composition and the degree of gas - phase depletion @xcite .",

    "the continuing accretion of gas by the cluster will alter the mass function , as will mergers between the newly - formed protostars ( which can not be followed using our current sink particle implementation ) .",
    "protostellar feedback in the form of winds , jets and hii regions may also play a role in determining the shape of the final stellar mass function .",
    "however , a key point to note is that the chaotic evolution of a bound system such as this cluster ensures that a wide spread of stellar masses will persist .",
    "some stars will enjoy favourable accretion at the expense of others that will be thrown out of the system ( as can be seen in figure [ fig : sequence ] ) , thus having their accretion effectively terminated ( see for example , the discussions in bonnell & bate 2006 and bonnell , larson & zinnecker 2007 ) .",

    "in this proceedings paper we have discussed several studies , where the thermodynamic behavior of the interstellar medium plays a crucial role in fragmentation and subsequent stellar birth .",
