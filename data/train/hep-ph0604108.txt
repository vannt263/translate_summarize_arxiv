    "the plan of the review is the following : in section  [ multi ] models based on multiple scattering will be reviewed . in section  [ dglap ] those models which do not try to address the origin of nuclear shadowing but rather to study its evolution through the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations  @xcite , will be discussed .",

    "i have mainly focused on the most recent approaches roughly starting from the early nineties , please have a look at  @xcite for an extensive list of references on earlier theoretical and experimental work .",
    "as commented in the introduction , the usual explanation for the origin of shadowing is multiple scattering  @xcite . while the basis of the explanation is common , phenomenological details of its application vary from model to model .",
    "for example , the hadronic component of the virtual photon may be given a partonic structure like in the dipole model  @xcite , see the next subsection , or modeled  @xcite as a superposition of hadronic states with the photon quantum numbers - vector meson dominance , or some combination of both approaches e.g.  @xcite .",
    "besides , what is seen as multiple scattering in the rest frame of the nucleus corresponds to recombination in the infinite momentum frame  @xcite . just to mention a few differences between the results of the models , the behaviour of models  @xcite is dominated by hadronic configurations of large size , so the results turns out to be basically @xmath4-independent . on the other hand , models which consider an expansion in power - suppressed corrections in @xmath28 , either a fixed number of terms  @xcite or some re - summation  @xcite ,",

    "some models rely on an eikonal approximation  @xcite , see below , and are unable to reproduce the return of @xmath1 nuclear ratios to 1 at @xmath29 , while others  @xcite include effects of finite coherence length , see below , and are able to reproduce such a behaviour .    in this section",
    "i will start by working out a little exercise which shows how multiple scattering leads to shadowing .",
    "this exercise should also clarify the origin of coherence effects .",
    "then , in the subsections models based on glauber - like rescatterings , on gribov inelastic shadowing , and finally the ideas based on high - energy qcd  @xcite , will be reviewed .",
    "for the exercise i consider the contribution coming from one and two scatterings , to the high - energy cross section of a massless scalar particle on a nucleus with mass number @xmath3 .",
    "the scattering centers plus the interaction vertex are represented by the projectile - nucleon forward scattering amplitude times the nuclear density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this example follows the spirit of the glauber - gribov theory  @xcite ; technical details can be found in section 3.1 and appendix a in  @xcite for the case of scalar qcd at high energy .",
    "-3 cm    i will use light - cone coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 the two - dimensional transverse vector , assume dominance of the @xmath33-components for the projectile , and define @xmath34 .",
    "i will employ the optical theorem for purely imaginary amplitudes , @xmath35 for projectile - nucleon and @xmath36 for the @xmath37-scattering contribution for projectile - nucleus collisions .",

    "[ fig4 ] right ) reads @xmath45 } \\rho_a(x_{1+},x_{1 t } ) \\rho_a(x_{2+},x_{2 t } ) \\theta(x_{2+}-x_{1 + } ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 the step function .",
    "the second equality follows from doing the @xmath47 integral closing the integration contour with an infinite semicircle in the lower half - plane and simplifying the remaining @xmath48-functions .",

    "this factor leads to @xmath53 ( the same happens for contributions with more than two scatterings ) .",
    "then all rescattering corrections vanish , so the total cross section results equal to the superposition of single scatterings ( [ eq6 ] ) - this limit is thus called the incoherent limit .",
    "this would imply a nuclear ratio equal to 1 , so shadowing vanishes for low energies i.e. large values of @xmath0 . on the other hand , in the large energy , totally coherent limit @xmath54 , @xmath50}\\to 1 $ ] and ( [ eq7 ] ) gives @xmath55 which in the forward case gives @xmath56 ^ 2 . \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] this correction turns out to be negative so the cross section is smaller than the superposition of independent collisions of the projectile with every nucleon in the nucleus , and the nuclear ratio results lower than one . in this way",
    ", multiple scattering offers an explanation for shadowing .",
    "furthermore , from this example it becomes evident that shadowing increases with increasing @xmath57 and mass number @xmath3 ( and , if the integration over @xmath58 is not performed , increasing centrality equivalent to decreasing @xmath58 ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath57 increases with increasing energy ( equivalent to decreasing @xmath0 ) or decreasing @xmath4 ( equivalent to increasing size of the hadronic component of the virtual photon , see the next subsection ) .",
    "most of these features , as indicated in the introduction , are seen in the experimental data .",
    "the differences between the models mentioned at the beginning of this section come both from the modeling of @xmath57 and to the way in which multiple scattering is considered .",
    "both aspects are the subject of the following subsections .    in the coherent limit the hadronic fluctuation of the virtual photon interacts with the target as a whole .",
    "the kinematical region where this happens can be discussed using a simple argument : in the laboratory frame where the nuclear target is at rest , the lifetime of the hadronic fluctuation of a @xmath59 with squared virtuality @xmath4 can be estimated using the uncertainty principle and the lorentz dilation in this frame , @xmath60 where i have used ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath61 .",
    "this lifetime increases with decreasing @xmath0 or increasing energy . for the hadronic fluctuation to interact with the nuclear target as a whole ,",
    "the lifetime has to be greater than the nuclear radius , @xmath62 .",
    "this implies @xmath63 .",
    "using typical values @xmath64 fm , we get @xmath65 which roughly coincides with the experimentally measured values of @xmath0 for which the transition from antishadowing to shadowing takes place .",
    "some models try to address the origin of nuclear shadowing through the glauber - gribov formalism in the totally coherent limit  @xcite .",
    "a proper treatment of coherence effects requires the consideration of the mass spectrum of intermediate fluctuations and will be discussed in detail in the next subsection , though some models  @xcite include coherence in an effective way .",
    "the glauber - gribov theory  @xcite considers the multiple scattering of the hadronic component of the virtual photon with a nucleus made of nucleons whose binding energy is neglected .",
    "this hadronic component keeps a fixed size during the scattering process - the eikonal approximation , and is usually limited to its lowest - order fock state , a @xmath66 pair - the so - called dipole model  @xcite .",
    "then the total dipole - nucleus cross section reads @xmath67 , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 the impact parameter of the center of the dipole relative to the center of the nucleus and @xmath69 the size of the dipole . this cross section",
    "is then related to the nuclear @xmath1 through ( [ eq3 ] ) and @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the distributions of colour dipoles of size @xmath69 created by splitting of the incident photon into a @xmath66 pair  @xcite .",
    "these distributions provide a definite relation between increasing @xmath27 and decreasing @xmath69 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the differences between realizations of this approach come mainly from the model used for the dipole - nucleon cross section ( equivalent to the dipole - proton cross section at the small values of @xmath0 where this approach is applicable ) .",
    "for example , in  @xcite a parametrization based on a saturation model  @xcite is used , while in  @xcite a form based on the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) pomeron  @xcite is employed , see subsection  [ hdqcd ] .",

    "also there i will discuss the issues of the saturation scale which can be extracted in this framework .      in the classical glauber model  @xcite subsequent interactions of the projectile with nucleons in the nucleus occur , and the intermediate states of the projectile are the same as the initial one i.e.",

    "[ fig6 ] it becomes clear that the square of such contribution is equivalent to a double exchange with a cut between the exchanged amplitudes , a so - called diffractive cut . to compute the first contribution to nuclear shadowing @xmath74 which comes from these two exchanges , one needs its total contribution to the @xmath59-nucleon cross section .",

    "details can be found in the corresponding references  @xcite .",
