    "the experimetal ability to switch randomly between physical apparatuses of the same type naturally endows mathematical representatives of physical objects with a convex structure .",
    "this makes the convexity ( and intimately related concept of probability ) one of the key mathematical features of any physical theory .",
    "even more , the particular `` convexity flavor '' plays a crucial role in the differences not only between the types of physical objects , but also between the theories .",
    "for example , the existence of non - unique convex decomposition of density operators is the property distinguishing quantum theory from the classical one @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study the convex structures that naturally appear in the quantum theory and to illustrate the operational meaning of the concepts directly linked to the convex structure .",
    "however , most of our findings are applicable for any convex set .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to introduce and investigate the concept of boundariness quantifying how far the individual elements of the convex set are from its boundary .",
    "intuitively , the boundariness determines the most non - uniform ( binary ) convex decomposition into boundary elements , hence , it quantifies how mixed the element is .",
    "we will show that this concept is operationally related to specification of the most distinguishable element ( in a sense of minimum - error discrimination probability ) .",
    "for instance , for states the evaluation of boundariness coincides with the specification of the best distinghuishable state from the given one , hence it is proportional to trace - distance @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the concept of boundariness and related results in general convex sets , the boundariness for quantum sets is evaluated in section iii and the relation to minimum - error discrimination is described in section iv .",
    "section v shortly summarizes the main results .",
    "the appendices contain mathematical details concerning the properties of weight function , characterization of the boundary elements of all considered quantum sets and numerical details of the case study .",
    "in any convex set @xmath0 we may define a convex preorder @xmath1 .",
    "we say @xmath2 if @xmath3 may appear in the convex decomposition of @xmath4 with a non zero weight , i.e. there exist @xmath5 such that @xmath6 with @xmath7 . if @xmath2 , then @xmath4 has @xmath3 in its convex decomposition , hence , ( losely speaking ) @xmath4 is `` more '' mixed than @xmath3 .",
    "the value of @xmath8 ( optimized over @xmath9 ) can be used to quantify this relation .",
    "namely , for any element @xmath10 we define the _ weight function _ @xmath11 $ ] assigning for every @xmath12 the supremum of possible weights @xmath8 of the point @xmath3 in the convex decomposition of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath13    obviously , @xmath14 and @xmath15 whenever @xmath16 . in order to understand the geometry of the optimal @xmath9 for a given pair of elements @xmath17 , it is useful to express the element @xmath9 in the form @xmath18 .",

    "( evaluation of boundariness ) [ prop : algorithm ] in practise , it is useful to think about some numerical way how to evaluate the boundariness .",

    "one may check that the operators @xmath563 constitute a minimal set of kraus operators for @xmath251 , i.e. ,  @xmath564 .",
    "moreover , the more familiar choi operator associated with the schrdinger ( predual ) version of @xmath251 is given by @xmath565 where @xmath566 , @xmath567 .",
    "let us note , that orthogonality of vectors @xmath568 implies the orthogonality of vectors @xmath569 , while their norm @xmath570 is the same .",
    "hence , we demonstrated the following .",
    "[ prop : schrodinger ] suppose that @xmath557 and @xmath558 are finite .",
    "a completely positive trace preserving map ( i.e. a channel in the schrdinger picture ) is on the boundary of the set of channels if and only if the rank of its choi operator is strictly less than @xmath559 .",

    "the aim of this appendix is to study two - element convex decompositions of the channel @xmath185 into extremal rank - two qubit channels @xmath193 and channels @xmath202 .",
    "any such channel @xmath193 has a choi matrix , which can be written in the spectral form : @xmath571 where @xmath572 are mutually orthogonal unit vectors on @xmath573 and @xmath574 , hence @xmath575}=1 $ ] .",
    "vectors @xmath134,@xmath289 can be written in the schmidt form @xmath576 with @xmath577 and @xmath578 .",
    "let us note that @xmath579 does not correspond to an extremal channel , but to a mixture of unitary channels ( i.e. it leads to @xmath580 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath581 requires that @xmath582 and @xmath583 the orthogonality @xmath584 gives @xmath585 for any two states of a qubit it holds that @xmath586 .",

    "can be satisfied only in two ways : i ) @xmath587 and @xmath588 , which is , according to eq .",

    "( [ eq : ccortho ] ) vanish .",
    "let us start with the case i ) , i.e both nonzero eigenvalues of choi operator @xmath190 are equal to @xmath142 and the scalar products of vectors @xmath590 and @xmath591 have opposite sign .",
    "since channel @xmath202 must belong to the boundary of the set of channels , there exists a normalized vector @xmath133 from the kernel of @xmath191 , i.e. @xmath592 .",
    "we compute the expectation value of @xmath593 along the vector @xmath133 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccdecomp1 ] ) we get @xmath594 where the lower bound on the left follows from the eigenvalues of @xmath593 being greater or equal to @xmath595 and we denoted @xmath596 .",
    "we notice that @xmath597 , because @xmath190 is positive semidefinite and its eigenvalues are zero and @xmath142 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chr2lb1 ] ) we get the lower bound @xmath598 . in other words the weight function @xmath196 gives on these channels @xmath193 values higher then @xmath599 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the convex decompositions ( [ eq : ccdecomp1 ] ) with rank - two channels @xmath193 having @xmath600 can not achieve as small value of @xmath8 as it is achieved by the unitary channels .",
    "so let us investigate the case ii ) and assume @xmath601 .",
    "our aim is to show that also in this case @xmath602 .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to solve this part of the problem completely analytically and we had to rely on numerical approach outlined in remark [ prop : algorithm ] .",
    "thus , the test whether the choi - operators @xmath191 generated by operators @xmath190 and the weight @xmath599 correspond to channels was done numerically .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath207 we calculated the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath191 for many choices of @xmath190 from the current subclass of extremal rank - two qubit channels and we confirmed that in all cases the obtained value is non - negative , i.e. @xmath191 always corresponded to a channel .",
    "below are some details on how the actual test was done .    without loss of generality",
    "we can write @xmath603 the choi - operator @xmath593 is invariant under the unitary transformations @xmath604 on the input hilbert space .",
    "these transformations do not change eigenvalues , so to investigate eigenvalues of @xmath191 we can equivalently investigate @xmath605 , which is for @xmath606 the same as choosing @xmath607 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ccschmidt ] ) , ( [ eq : ccmc1 ] ) and working directly with @xmath191 . moreover , we parameterize the vectors @xmath608 , @xmath609 as : @xmath610 in this way operator @xmath611 further specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ccdeff]-[eq : ccschmidt ] ) , ( [ eq : relqsr ] ) , ( [ eq : ccmc1]-[eq : ccdefog ] ) and @xmath607 becomes a function of parameters @xmath612 .",
    "let us note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : relqsr ] ) requires parameters @xmath613 and @xmath614 to fulfill @xmath615 , since one must have @xmath616 .",
    "especially , @xmath617 requires @xmath618 and the operator @xmath190 converges to a choi operator of a unitary channel . in such case",
    "we expect that @xmath619 , the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath191 , will converge to zero , because @xmath202 must converge to a boundary in the set of channels .",
    "for this reason it is useful to plot @xmath619 as a function of @xmath613 for some choice of remaining parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : numresults ] ) . by numerically analyzing the actual dependence of the graphs on the parameters @xmath620 we observed that for a fixed @xmath613 the minimum and the maximum value of @xmath619 can be achieved only when @xmath621 and @xmath622 ; @xmath623 , respectively . in such case parameters @xmath624 and @xmath625",
    "do not influence @xmath619 and it can be calculated analytically .",
