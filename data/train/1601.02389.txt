    "it is now widely accepted that most galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in their centers and that the formation and evolution of galaxies is fundamentally influenced by properties of their central smbhs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "active galaxies most likely represent one phase in galactic evolution , and they derive their extraordinary luminosities from energy release by matter accreting towards , and falling into , a central smbh through a relativistic accretion disk which represents an efficient mechanism for extracting the gravitational potential energy and converting it into the electromagnetic radiation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein )    since its discovery in seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by @xcite , the broad fe k@xmath0 emission line at 6.4 kev was observed in a number of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "based on the observations with the x - ray satellites like ginga , asca , rxte , bepposax , xmm - newton , suzaku and chandra , the fact that x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk surface in a class of agns known as seyfert 1 galaxies gives rise to the fluorescent fe k@xmath0 line emission via the x - ray reflection is now well established ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the broad and asymmetric profile of this line with narrow bright  blue  and wide faint  red  peak is most commonly attributed to the relativistic effects due to a very fast rotation of the emitting material in the innermost regions of the accretion disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although there are some alternative attempts to explain such profile by scattering / reflection / absorption by the disk wind and/or ionized outflows which could mimic relativistic effects ( see * ? ? ?",

    "rotation of emitting material in the outermost regions of an accretion disk , located thousands @xmath23 from the central smbh , is practically keplerian since the relativistic effects are negligible at such large distances .",
    "therefore , the lines emitted from these regions are broadened depending on keplerian rotational velocity and have two symmetric peaks ( see the solid line profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : out ] ) : the  blue  one emitted by the material located on the side of the disk which is approaching towards an observer ( denoted by blue shades in the simulated accretion disk image presented in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) , and the  red  one , emitted by the material on the receding side of the disk with respect to the observer ( denoted by red shades in the top panel of fig .",

[",
    "fig : out ] ) .",
    "these two special relativistic effects are known as transverse doppler shift and doppler beaming , respectively .",
    "the transverse doppler shift originates when the observer is displaced in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the motion of emitters in the accretion disk , and is a consequence of the relativistic doppler effect which includes the time dilation .",
    "namely , if in the observer s frame the angle between the direction of the emitter at the time of emission and the observed direction of the light at the time of observation is equal to @xmath25 , the relativistic doppler effect reduces to the transverse doppler shift , due to which the observed radiation from a rapidly rotating accretion disk is redshifted by the lorentz factor , as it is the case with the dashed simulated line profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : out ] .",
    "doppler beaming ( boosting ) modifies the apparent brightness of the rapidly moving emitting matter in the sense that , if it is moving towards the observer then it will appear brighter than if it is at rest , and vice versa , if it is moving away from the observer it will appear fainter than if it is at rest .",
    "when this is applied to the rapidly rotating emitters in the accretion disk , it will enhance the apparent brightness of the approaching side of the disk with respect to its receding side ( see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) , and thus it will also enhance the  blue  peak of the line with respect to its  red  peak , as it can be seen from the dashed simulated line profile in fig . [",
    "fig : out ] .    since the velocities of material , as well as the radii of the emitting region of the dashed simulated line profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : out ] , correspond to the parts of the disk from which the optical spectral lines like @xmath26 and @xmath27 are observed , one can conclude that the transverse doppler shift and doppler beaming significantly affect even the optical lines which originate from outer regions of the accretion disk . in the case of such lines , as it can be seen from table [ tab : tab1 ] , the maximum redshift of the photons @xmath28 is significantly larger by absolute value than their maximum blueshift @xmath29 , which quantitatively represents the influence of transverse doppler shift in this case .",
    "however , since the fe k@xmath0 line originates in the innermost regions of an accretion disk , its emitting material rotates with the fastest velocities ( on the order of tens of thousands of km s@xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , the previously mentioned classical and special relativistic effects are even more significant in the case of fe k@xmath0 line ( see the both panels in fig . [",
    "fig : in ] , as well as the corresponding rows in table [ tab : tab1 ] ) . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] , when compared to the simulated profile of an optical line ( dashed profile from fig .",
    "[ fig : out ] ) , the fe k@xmath0 line profile is much wider ( due to the larger classical doppler shift ) , more asymmetric ( due to the larger doppler beaming ) and more redshifted ( due to the larger transverse doppler shift , as well as due to the gravitational redshift which is discussed in more details in the following paragraph ) .     line emitted from the innermost regions of a relativistic accretion disk around a schwarzschild smbh with inclination of @xmath30 , outer radius of @xmath31 and inner radius of @xmath32 ( solid line ) , as well as @xmath33 ( dashed line ) .",
    "_ bottom : _ the same as above , but in the case of an accretion disk around a maximally rotating kerr smbh for which @xmath34,title=\"fig : \" ] +   line emitted from the innermost regions of a relativistic accretion disk around a schwarzschild smbh with inclination of @xmath30 , outer radius of @xmath31 and inner radius of @xmath32 ( solid line ) , as well as @xmath33 ( dashed line ) . _",
    "bottom : _ the same as above , but in the case of an accretion disk around a maximally rotating kerr smbh for which @xmath34,title=\"fig : \" ]      according to the general relativity , the observed frequency of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source in a strong gravitational field in vicinity of a smbh will be reduced with respect to the emitted frequency , due to gravitational time dilation .",
    "this effect is called the gravitational redshift @xcite , and in the newtonian limit it is approximately proportional to the mass of a smbh and inversely proportional to the distance between it and a point in the disk at which a photon is emitted .    in order to study the influence of the gravitational redshift on the fe k@xmath0 line profile , we simulated the line profiles originating from two emitting regions in accretion disk around a non - rotating schwarzschild smbh ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] ) and a maximally rotating kerr smbh ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] ) , having two different inner radii : @xmath32 ( denoted by solid lines ) and @xmath3 ( denoted by dashed lines ) . the outer radii in both cases are @xmath4 . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] , in the case of both metrics the profiles originating from emitting regions with smaller inner radii are redshifted with respect to the profiles from emitting regions with larger inner radii , due to the gravitational redshift .",
    "this is even more obvious if one compare the corresponding maximum redshifts @xmath28 and blueshifts @xmath29 presented in table [ tab : tab1 ] , from which it can be seen that the maximum redshifts are much bigger in the cases with the smaller inner radii , while the blueshifts are the same in both cases .",
    "therefore , the gravitational redshift causes the further deformations of the fe k@xmath0 line profile by smearing its  blue  emission into the  red  one .    this effect is stronger in the case of a maximally rotating kerr smbh than in the case of a non - rotating schwarzschild smbh due to the fact that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( also known as radius of marginally stable orbit , @xmath20 ) strongly depends on smbh spin @xmath6 , so that in the case of a non - rotating schwarzschild smbh ( i.e. for @xmath35 ) it is equal to @xmath36 ( top panel in fig . [",
    "fig : in ] ) , and in the case of an extremely rotating kerr smbh ( i.e. for @xmath37 ) it is equal to @xmath38 ( bottom panel in fig . [",
    "fig : in ] ) .",
    "thus , in the case of an extremely rotating smbh it is possible to detect the radiation which originates closer to the smbh itself , and which is therefore more subjected to the gravitational redshift ( see the last row in table [ tab : tab1 ] ) , than in the case of a non - rotating schwarzschild smbh .    in that way",
    "the smbh spin @xmath6 affects the radiation originating from the innermost regions of the disk which are closest to the smbh ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , as it can be seen from both panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] and the corresponding rows of table [ tab : tab1 ] , it significantly affects the profile of the fe k@xmath0 line , especially its  red  wing by extending it towards the lower energies for the higher values of @xmath6 ( see also @xcite for a case study and @xcite for more details ) .      beside the previously mentioned classical , special and general relativistic effects",
    ", several observational / theoretical studies indicated that the line shapes and shifts could be affected by the perturbations of the disk emissivity in the form of flares or orbiting bright spots , especially in the case of high accretion rate objects , such as seyfert galaxies and qsos ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , appearance of the redshifted fe k@xmath0 emission feature due to co - rotating flare above the accretion disk which irradiates a spot on its surface was reported in the case of the seyfert galaxies ngc 3516 @xcite and ngc 3783 @xcite , based on their observations by xmm - newton . however , since the sensitivity of xmm - newton was not sufficient to clearly resolve sub - orbital features in the observed x - ray spectra , the azimuthal irradiation structure of the inner accretion disk is modeled and simulated by @xcite in order to investigate the detectability of orbiting spots in nearby seyfert galaxies with current and future x - ray observatories , such as x - ray evolving universe spectroscopy ( xeus ) , a planned successor to xmm - newton which evolved to advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics ( athena+ ) that is currently under development , aiming to have several hundred times larger sensitivity than chandra x - ray observatory and xmm - newton . for that purpose , @xcite developed a method to compute the local spectra of the hot spot emission from the surface of an accretion disk underlying a strong co - rotating flare above the disk , and used it to model the x - ray reprocessing from a persisting flare lasting for a significant fraction of one orbital period at the given disk radius in some agns such as mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc 5548 , as well as the short - term flares with durations of a few hundreds of seconds .",
    "these studies showed that the future high precision observations will allow to disentangle the effects of the flares in the accretion disks of seyfert galaxies from the intrinsic variability of the local emission , even at distances which are less than @xmath39 from the central smbhs @xcite .",
    "also , the spectral variations induced by such flares depend on the viewing direction and are stronger for intermediate ( edge - on ) viewing angles , as supposed for seyfert-2 galaxies , than for a face - on viewing direction , as assumed in seyfert-1 galaxies , and thus , they could be used to put observational constraints on the disk inclination @xcite . however , indications for the flares in the accretion disks were found not only in the x - ray band , but also in the optical spectra of some agns .",
    "for example , the variability of the observed @xmath27 line profiles of quasar 3c 390.3 was recently successfully explained by a perturbation of the power law disk emissivity , revealing the appearance of two successive bright spots on the approaching side of the disk which were interpreted as the fragments of spiral arms in the accretion disk of 3c 390.3 @xcite .    , extending from @xmath20 up to @xmath40 for a perturbing region located at the receding side of the disk . _",

    "an illustration of the perturbed disk emissivity is presented in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pert ] , and the perturbed and unperturbed fe k@xmath0 line profiles for three different positions and widths of perturbing region are given in the bottom panel of the same figure .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pert ] , a perturbing region on the receding side of accretion disk , affects only the  red wing  of the fe k@xmath0 line , while the  blue  one and the line core stay nearly unaffected .",
    "moreover , the position of perturbing region is in a direct relation with the position of the  red peak  of the line .",
    "recently , a model of accretion disk with perturbing region was used for fitting the observed spectra of some agns , resulting with a non - random distribution of bright spot positions along the receding side of the disk .",
    "this indicated that the most plausible physical mechanism which can explain such behaviour is a fragmented spiral arm of the accretion disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "perturbing regions could be then explained by the emissivity lumps caused by fragments in spiral arms , such as isolated clumps which could pass through the arm and dominate in its emissivity .",
    "the fragments naturally travel with the arm as it precesses through the disk , but since the outer parts of an accretion disk are self - gravitating , the fragments of spiral arms could be also launched from the outer regions of the disk and propagate inward @xcite . besides , in the inner regions of the disk , the disk winds and highly ionized fast outflows could play an important role and could also cause the outward propagation of such clumps ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the flux variability caused by a spiral arm is on timescales of a year to several years while its fragments cause shorter variations on timescales of several months , this model is able to explain the observed variability of some agns on the timescales ranging from several months to several years @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen from figure [ fig : pert ] , when a perturbation which originates in the inner regions of the disk and , due to some wind or outflow , spirals away along the receding side of the disk further from the central smbh and toward the outer parts of the disk , it will cause the blueward shift of the  red peak  which will therefore move towards the line core .",
    "this demonstrates that in some cases , the deformations of the line profiles could arise due to shifts of some of their parts , caused by the variability of the disk emissivity ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "binary systems of supermassive black holes are formed in galactic mergers , and at some stage when two smbhs become gravitationally bound and start to orbit around their center of mass , accretion of the surrounding matter on both smbhs could be expected and as a result , a strong line emission could arise ( see @xcite for theoretical aspects and @xcite for observational evidences ) .",
    "in such a case , the fe k@xmath0 line might be also observed , and it would most likely arise from both accretion disks around primary and secondary smbhs , located in a central low density cavity of a circumbinary disk @xcite . therefore , the fe k@xmath0 line profiles emitted from both accretion disks might be affected by the doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the smbh binary , and in that case the corresponding signatures would be imprinted in the observed composite line profile @xcite .",

    "such shifts and ripple variability of the complex fe k@xmath0 line profiles strongly depend on the orbital phase of the binary system , and therefore if observed in the spectra of some agns , they could represent the observational signatures of the existence of smbh binary systems in the cores of these agns .",

    "<S> here we present a short overview and main results of our investigations of several effects which can induce shifts in the broad fe k@xmath0 line emitted from relativistic accretion disks around single and binary supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we used numerical simulations based on ray - tracing method in the kerr metric to study the role of classical doppler shift , special relativistic transverse doppler shift and doppler beaming , general relativistic gravitational redshift , and perturbations of the disk emissivity in the formation of the observed fe k@xmath0 line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we also investigated whether the observed line profiles from the binary systems of supermassive black holes could be affected by the doppler shifts due to dynamics of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> the presented results demonstrate that all these effects could have a significant influence on the observed profiles of the broad fe k@xmath0 line emitted from relativistic accretion disks around single and binary supermassive black holes . </S>"
