    "the radiation properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the agn central location in their host galaxies imply that they play a very important role in determining the ionization structure and dynamics of matter not only in their vicinity but also on larger , galactic and even intergalactic scales ( cotti & ostriker , 1997 , 2001 ; king 2003 ; murray , quataert , & thompson 2005 ; sazonov et al . 2005 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al . 2005 , and references therin ) .",
    "many observational results support this suggestion , in particular the presence of broad emission and absorption lines in agn spectra .",
    "the ionization structure and dynamics of the gas responsible for these lines can be driven by radiation , even for sub - eddington sources .",
    "the driving can be due to radiation pressure or radiation heating , or both ( e.g. , begelman , mckee and shields , 1982 ; shlosman , vitello & shaviv 1985 ; ostriker , mckee , & klein 1991 ; arav & li 1994 ; murray et al .",
    "1995 ; proga , stone & kallman 2000 ; proga & kallman 2002 , 2004 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "i present results from hydrodynamical simulations of a non - rotating gas on sub - parsec- and parsec - scales in agns .",
    "i use a simplified version of the numerical method developed by proga , stone & kallman ( 2000 ) to study a related problem of radiation driven disk winds in agn ( for details see proga et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "i consider an axisymmetric flow accreting onto a supermassive black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the flow is non - spherical because it is irradiated by an accretion disk .",
    "the disk radiation flux is the highest along the disk rotational axis and is gradually decreasing with increasing polar angle , @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "the flow is also irradiated by an isotropic corona ( see eq .",
    "i take into account the radiation heating and cooling , radiation pressure due to the electron scattering and spectral lines .",
    "i adopt a simplified treatment of photoionization , and radiative cooling and heating allowing for a self - consistent calculation of the ionization state , and therefore the line force , in the flow .",
    "i assume the mass of the non - rotating bh , @xmath3 and the disk inner radius , @xmath4  cm throughout this paper .",
    "i consider the case with the rest mass conversion efficient @xmath5 and the mass accretion rate , @xmath6 =  10@xmath7  (= 1.6  @xmath8 ) .",
    "these system parameters yield the accretion luminosity , @xmath9 , corresponding to 0.6 of the eddington luminosity . to determine the radiation field , i specify the fraction of @xmath10 in the uv and x - ray band , as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "although , a quasar is powered by accretion , the disk accretion rate , that determines radiation , is not coupled to the rate , @xmath13 at which the non - rotating gas leaves the computational domain of these simulations through the inner boundary .",
    "this @xmath6@xmath13 decoupling is physically motivated because an accretion disk is build from rotating gas but non - rotating gas will not significantly contribute to the disk mass and to the system luminosity . in this sense ,",
    "i study radiatively inefficient flows accreting onto an object with a radiatively efficient accretion disk .",
    "i present here preliminary results from simulations where all model parameters are fixed except for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "i consider three cases : case a with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , case b with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and case c with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see table 1 for summary of the runs ) .    at large radii ,",
    "the radial radiation force from the disk and spherical corona can be approximated as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath1 are the radius and polar angle in the spherical polar coordinate system , respectively while the terms in the brackets with @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to the disk and corona contribution , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "i assume that all uv photons are emitted by the disk whereas all x - rays are emitted by the corona .",
    "the @xmath22 is the so - called force multiplier - the numerical factor which parameterizes by how much spectral lines increase the scattering coefficient compared to the electron scattering coefficient ( castor , abbott & klein 1975 ) .",
    "( 280,370 ) ( 130,190 )    ( 310,190 )    ( 130,10 )    ( 310,10 )    figure 1 compares the results from run a and run c. i specified the outer boundary in the following way .",
    "the density and temperature at the outer radius , @xmath23 was set to @xmath24 and @xmath25  k , respectively .",
    "the velocity was set to zero . at the outer radial boundary , during the evolution of each model i continue to apply these constraints that the density and temperature are fixed at constant values at all times . for the initial conditions , i set all variables constant and equal to their values at the outer boundary , as listed above .",
    "the figure shows the instantaneous density , temperature , and distributions and the poloidal velocity field of the models .",
    "additionally , it also shows the so - called compton radius corrected for the effects of radiation pressure due to electron scattering @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27  cm   = @xmath28 is the uncorrected compton radius for the compton temperature , @xmath29  k.    in all runs , the flow settles quickly into a steady state ( within @xmath30 a few @xmath31  s which correspond to a few dynamical time scales at @xmath23 , @xmath32  s ) .",
    "the steady state consists of two flow components ( 1 ) an equatorial inflow and ( 2 ) a bipolar inflow / outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the pole .",
    "the outflow is collimated by the inflow .",
    "the calculations capture the subsonic and supersonic parts of both the inflow and outflow .",
    "although the same components can be identified in all runs , their size , density and temperature , and the degree of outflow collimation depend on @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the spectral energy distribution and geometry of the radiation field ) .",
    "in particular , the outflow power ( e.g. , measured as the kinetic energy , @xmath33 , and thermal energy @xmath34 carried by the outflow ) and the degree of collimation is higher for the model with the radiation dominated by the uv / disk emission ( run c ) than for the model with the radiation dominated by the x - ray / corona emission ( run a ) .",
    "i note that a very narrow outflow driven by radiation pressure on lines can carry more energy and mass than a broad outflow driven by thermal expansion ( compared results for runs c and a ) .",
    "the simulations show that agn can have a substantial outflow which originates from the inflow at large radii .",
    "such an outflow can control the rate at which non - rotating matter is supplied to the agn central engine because the outflow mass loss rate , @xmath35 , can be significantly higher than the mass inflow rate at small radii , @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in run c , as little as 10% of the inflow at large radii reaches small radii because 90% of the inflow is turned into an outflow .",
    "however , even the power of the strongest outflow is very low compared to the radiation power ( i.e. , for run c , @xmath36 ) .",
    "finally , the inflows and outflows , found in these simulations , can be related to material responsible for broad absorption and emission lines , and narrow absorption and emission lines observed in x - ray and uv spectra of agn .",
    "the quantities in the table are in the following units : @xmath37 , @xmath13 , and @xmath38 are in units of @xmath39  g  s@xmath40 , @xmath41 is in units of @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are in units of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath40 .",
