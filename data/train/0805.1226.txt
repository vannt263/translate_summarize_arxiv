    "wireless operators are in the process of augmenting the macrocellular network with supplemental infrastructure such as microcells@xcite , distributed antennas@xcite and relays .",
    "an alternative with lower upfront costs is to improve indoor coverage and capacity using the concept of _ end - consumer _ installed femtocells or home base stations@xcite .",
    "a femtocell serves as a low power , short range data access point that provides high quality in - building coverage to home users , while backhauling their traffic over the ip network . the femtocell radio range ( @xmath0 meters )",
    "is much smaller than the macrocell radius ( @xmath1 meters ) @xcite .",
    "users transmitting to femtocells experience superior indoor signal reception and lower their transmit power , consequently prolonging battery life .",
    "the implication is that femtocells provide higher spatial reuse and cause less cochannel interference ( cci ) to other users .",
    "the principal arguments in favor of femtocells are summarized in @xcite .    in a shared spectrum two - tier network ( universal frequency reuse ) , recent research @xcite has shown that near - far effects arising from cross - tier interference create a fundamental trade - off : assuming all femtocell users seek a common sir , the product of all pareto - optimal macrocell and femtocell sir targets is a constant dependent only on the intra- and cross - tier channel powers , irrespective of the power control strategy .",
    "perron - frobenius theory@xcite shows that any combination of per - tier target sirs whose product violates the above constraint causes the spectral radius of the normalized channel power matrix to exceed unity ; hence , there may not be a feasible power allocation for all users .",
    "the worst - case scenario arise either when a high powered macrocell user on the cell edge causes interference to nearby femtocells , or when cell interior femtocell users cause unacceptable interference to the macrocell bs .",
    "the papers @xcite have suggested addressing this near - far problem by either    forcing femtocell users to decrease their target data rates , or    employing interference avoidance ( e.g. randomized time hopping ) among both macrocell and femtocell users in order to  avoid \" transmitting in the same interval .",
    "both approaches have drawbacks because they require either reducing sir targets at femtocells , or accommodating femtocells by altering the transmission scheme at an existing macrocell in order to ensure tolerable performance .",
    "the subject of this paper is to motivate and propose a spectrum partitioning strategy in a two - tier deployment .",
    "frequency division multiple access ( fdma ) s resurgence in emerging ofdma wireless standards such as the 3gpp s lte , wimax and 3gpp2 s umb enable the macrocell to perform flexible rate assignment@xcite across frequency sub bands to users and provide interference management by fractional frequency reuse .",
    "in femtocell deployments , due to reasons of scalability , security and limited availability of backhaul bandwidth , it is reasonable to assume the absence of coordination between femtocells and the central macrocell .",
    "further , femtocells are placed opportunistically or randomly by end users .",
    "therefore , conventional frequency planning strategies will be very difficult in a two - tier network .",
    "assigning orthogonal spectrum resources between the central macrocell and femtocell bss eliminates cross - tier interference .",
    "this motivates the orthogonal access spectrum allocation strategy proposed in this paper .",
    "next , to avoid persistent collisions with neighboring femtocells in their allotted spectrum , this paper proposes that each femtocell accesses a random subset of the candidate frequency subchannels , wherein each subchannel is accessed with equal probability .",
    "we term this spectrum access strategy as f - aloha ( frequency aloha ) .",
    "we motivate f - aloha for three reasons .",
    "first , f - aloha avoids transmission delays and increased rf sensitivity requirements for sensing frequency subchannels in the presence of channel fading@xcite .",
    "next , f - aloha provides randomized interference avoidance , since neighboring femtocells are unlikely to consistently access identical frequency subchannels .",
    "finally , such a transmission strategy offers a decentralized spectrum access by femtocells  eliminating backhaul communication cost between femtocells over the internet  and low complexity .",
    "* f - aloha spectrum access : * if a femtocell transmits over all its allotted subchannels , it may cause excessive interference to surrounding femtocells ; conversely , accessing only a few subchannels could result in a poor spatial reuse . with f - aloha , there should be an optimal fraction of spectrum access for each femtocell in order to maximize the spatial reuse of spectrum , or in effect the net number of simultaneous transmissions per unit area@xcite .",
    "the spatial reuse is readily expressible using the _ area spectral efficiency _ ( ase ) in @xmath2@xcite , which is defined as the network - wide spatially averaged throughput per frequency subchannel divided by the product of the subchannel bandwidth and the area over which the transmissions take place .",
    "based on the stated reasons , we assume    downlink transmissions from the macrocell and femtocells are frequency orthogonal and    femtocells transmit using f - aloha ,    and pose the following questions :    * what is the expected subchannel throughput inside the macrocell [ resp .",
    "femtocell ] , as a function of interference from neighboring macrocells [ resp .",
    "femtocells ] , and terrestrial propagation parameters such as path - loss exponent and lognormal shadowing ?",
    "* given the expected subchannel throughput , the average number of femtocells per cell - site and the number of users associated with each bs , how should the bandwidth be partitioned between tiers in order to satisfy a quality of service ( qos ) requirement in each tier ? * with this spectrum allocation strategy , how much improvement in network - wide ase does opportunistic channel aware macrocell scheduling offer relative to channel blind scheduling ?",
    "existing research on hierarchical cellular systems has mainly focused on channel assignment in two - tier macrocell / microcell radio systems@xcite . in the context of this paper ,",
    "a microcell has a much larger radio range ( 100 - 500 m ) than a femtocell , and generally implies centralized deployment , i.e. by the service - provider .",
    "these works typically either assume only a single microcell , or regularly spaced multiple microcells .",
    "such an assumption may be impractical in femtocell networks because of the variations in their placement from one cell site to the next .",
    "we would also like to clarify the differing objectives between a femtocell and microcell overlay .",
    "a microcell overlay allows the operator to handoff and load balance users between each tier in response to changing traffic conditions@xcite .",
    "so , the operator can preferentially assign users ( e.g high data rate users ) by converting microcells into data access points@xcite .",
    "in contrast , femtocells are consumer installed and the traffic requirements at femtocells are user determined without any operator influence . in heterogeneous networks , @xcite suggest providing vertical handoffs ( admission control ) and qos - aware routing to switch traffic between cellular and _ ad hoc _ technologies .",
    "however , these approaches may not be viable in two - tier femtocell networks because of the lack of coordination between macrocell and femtocell bss ; instead , decentralized strategies for interference management and load balancing may be preferred .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is related to yeung and nanda @xcite , who propose frequency partitioning in a microcell / macrocell system based on mobile speeds and the loading of users in each cell .",
    "similar dynamic channel allocation schemes have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their frequency partitioning is derived based on choosing handoff velocity thresholds and maximizing the overall system capacity , subject to per - tier blocking probability constraints that ignore co - channel interference ( cci ) .",
    "in contrast , our work determines the spectrum allocation which maximizes the system - wide ase considering interference from neighboring bss , path loss and prevailing channel conditions .",
    "in decentralized networks , jindal _ _ et al.__@xcite have derived the optimal number of frequency subchannels @xmath3 for a frequency - hopped ad hoc network assuming a fixed data rate requirement per transmitter - receiver pair and a target outage probability .",
    "our work , in contrast , assumes a fixed @xmath3 ( as is the case with ofdma ) , allowing for multiple subchannels to be accessed by each bs , with variable rate transmission per accessed subchannel . in a hybrid network composed of ad - hoc nodes and",
    "bs infrastructure nodes , zemlianov and de veciana@xcite and liu _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have derived asymptotic scaling laws relating to the per user throughput as the number of infrastructure nodes increase .",
    "in addition to the hierarchical nature of our model , the main difference is that this paper assumes single - hop communication . in wlan networks ,",
    "bahl _ _ et al.__@xcite have proposed variable center frequencies and variable channel width per access point for improving the spectrum utilization and fairness for heavily loaded access points ( aps ) .",
    "finally , game - theoretic approaches have been recently investigated for both non - cooperative @xcite and cooperative @xcite spectrum sharing in decentralized networks .",
    "this paper employs a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the random spatial distribution of femtocells .",
    "hotspot locations are likely to vary from one cell site to another , and be opportunistic rather than planned , so an analysis that embraces instead of neglecting randomness should provide more accurate results and more plausible insights . towards this end , femtocells are assumed to be scattered according to a spatial poisson point process ( sppp)@xcite , and inter - femtocell interference is modeled as poisson shot - noise@xcite . this model has been used extensively in prior work @xcite , and its validity has been confirmed in empirical studies@xcite .",
    "the proposed spectrum allocation maximizes the network - wide ase in a two - tier network , assuming each macrocell transmits to a single user per frequency subchannel , while femtocells access spectrum using f - aloha .",
    "the allocation is determined in two steps .",
    "first , the per - tier ases are quantified based on the propagation environment and neighboring cell interference . with an increasing number of macrocell users ,",
    "the ase of the macrocell is either fixed ( for a channel blind scheduler ) or increasing ( by opportunistic scheduling ) . for the femtocell network ,",
    "the ases are derived based on the optimal spectrum access using f - aloha .",
    "next , the optimal allocation is determined as one that maximizes the weighted mean of the per - tier ases  the weights are given by the fraction of spectrum accessed by each tier .",
    "the three contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "the expected per - tier throughput is derived for the macrocell and femtocell users accounting for interference from neighboring cells .",
    "the maximum ase of the femtocell network is shown to be _ unchanged _",
    "with addition of hotspots beyond a threshold . at low femtocell densities ,",
    "the highest femtocell ases are attained when each femtocell accesses the entire available spectrum . in higher densities",
    ", femtocells should use a decreasing fraction of the spectrum ; e.g. with an average of @xmath4 femtocells in each cell site , each femtocell should access @xmath5 of the available spectrum .",
    "the proposed spectrum allocation maximizes the spatial reuse in a two - tier network , subject to a network - wide qos requirement , which guarantees a minimum expected throughput per - user .",
    "differing qos constraints produce markedly different spectrum allocations due to the competing spatial coverage scales in each tier .",
    "notably , a qos requiring equal per - user throughputs in each tier means assigning greater than @xmath6 of spectrum to the macrocell .",
    "conversely , an even division of spectrum occurs when the qos constraints favor femtocells to provide significantly higher data rates .",
    "gains generated by channel aware macrocell scheduling permeate to femtocells , resulting in a significant spectrum reduction with the proposed allocation . with an average of @xmath7 femtocells / cell site and target per - tier data rates of @xmath8 mbps / macrocell user and @xmath9 mbps / hotspot user , a channel aware macrocell scheduler provides nearly @xmath10 reduction in necessary spectrum compared to a channel blind scheduler .",
    "finally , with increasing number of hotspot users , the spectrum requirements in a two - tier network show two extremes .",
    "one is a low interference scenario where addition of hotspots provides increased spatial reuse , ensuring that the necessary spectrum is unchanged up to @xmath11 femtocells / cell site . in a high interference scenario however",
    ", the ensuing co - channel interference may necessitate a linear increase in required spectrum with hotspot density .",
