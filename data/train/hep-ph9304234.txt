    "for the past decade or so , the study of first - order phase transitions in cosmology has been the focus of much interest due to their possible relevance to the physics of the early universe .",
    "some well - known examples are inflationary models @xcite , the quark - hadron transition @xcite and , more recently , the generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry in the electroweak phase transition @xcite .    in a first - order phase transition",
    ", the initial metastable phase decays to the stable phase by the nucleation of bubbles larger than a critical size .",
    "this decay may be triggered by either quantum or thermal fluctuations , depending on how the ambient temperature compares to the nucleation barrier @xcite . within a cosmological context",
    ", the cooling is provided by the expansion of the universe ; the long - wavelength modes of the order parameter responsible for the symmetry breaking transition are coupled to the `` environment '' , which is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath0 .",
    "( here , we are mainly concerned with `` late '' transitions , for which the typical fluctuation time - scales are much shorter than the expansion rate . )    of great relevance to the understanding of the evolution of the phase transition is the determination of the bubble nucleation rate per unit volume .",
    "this is a well - known problem in classical statistical mechanics , with an long history @xcite .",
    "phenomenological field - theoretic treatments were developed by cahn and hilliard @xcite , and by langer @xcite in the context of a time - dependent coarse - grained ginzburg - landau model .",
    "classical homogeneous nucleation theory within a field theoretic context has been recently shown by numerical experiments to successfully predict the nucleation barrier @xcite . in the case of zero - temperature quantum field theory , the study of metastable vacuum decay was initiated with the work of voloshin , kobzarev , and okun @xcite , and was put onto firm theoretical ground by coleman and callan in the late seventies @xcite .",
    "finite temperature corrections to the vacuum decay rate were first considered by linde @xcite , who argued that temperature corrections to the nucleation rate are obtained recalling that finite temperature field theory ( at sufficiently high temperatures ) in @xmath1-dimensions is equivalent to @xmath2-dimensional euclidean quantum field theory with @xmath3 substituted by @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in @xmath1 dimensions , the nucleation rate is proportional to @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the @xmath2-dimensional euclidean action evaluated at its extremum ( specifically , a saddle point ) , the critical bubble , or bounce , @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath10 is the one - loop approximation to the finite temperature effective potential , and @xmath11 .",
    "there are three important points here .",
    "the first is that in order to estimate the determinantal prefactor ( the `` equilibrium '' part of the prefactor ; there is a dynamic factor which can not be obtained by using equilibrium arguments ) one usually proceeds by invoking dimensional arguments to approximate it by a term of order @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the critical temperature ) .",
    "how good is this approximation ? clearly , in most cases it is impossible to evaluate the determinants exactly .",
    "but can one obtain a better approximation than the simple use of dimensional arguments ? the second , and most important , point is that the critical bubble configuration @xmath14 used to evaluate the nucleation barrier , denoted above by @xmath15 , was obtained from an effective potential which includes corrections coming from scalar loops .",
    "hence the temperature dependence in @xmath16",
    ". we will show here that this procedure is not in general justified and is only a good approximation if the corrections from scalar loops are negligible . finally , in the expression for the temperature corrected barrier in eq .",
    "( [ badrate ] ) , @xmath17 , one uses the _ temperature corrected _ effective potential , @xmath18 as opposed to the tree level potential .",
    "thus , it is claimed that @xmath17 is equivalent to the free energy of the temperature dependent bounce , given by @xmath19 \\ : .",
    "\\label{badact}\\ ] ] as far as we know , apart from the work of affleck in the context of finite temperature quantum mechanics @xcite , this point has never been properly addressed in the literature .",
    "how did the temperature corrected potential appear in the exponent ? is the exponentiation of the massless modes sufficient ?",
    "in fact , most of the work done on cosmological phase transitions in which temperature effects are important ( including some by the present authors ) simply invokes linde s results .",
    "given the many applications of finite temperature vacuum decay in cosmology , we feel that this important question should not be left unscrutinized .",
    "this concern has also been expressed in recent works by csernai and kapusta @xcite , and by buchm@xmath20ller , helbig , and walliser @xcite .",
    "both works attempted to improve on linde s results , by generalizations of langer s work .",
    "csernai and kapusta obtained an expression for the dynamical prefactor by using a relativistic hydrodynamic approach , while buchm@xmath20ller _ et al .",
    "_ obtained an approximate expression for the decay rate in scalar electrodynamics ( and more recently , with z. fodor , in the standard electroweak model ) by integrating out the electromagnetic degrees of freedom from the partition function .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of the nucleation barrier and how it compares to the usual result is still lacking .    in this paper we address the three points raised above",
    ". we will be mostly interested in the regime in which thermal fluctuations are much larger than quantum fluctuations .",
    "this way we avoid the question of how to match continuously the two regimes , although we believe this to be a very important question @xcite .",
    "( see also refs . @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the hope is that in most situations of interest the transition will be dominated by one or the other regime . by a saddle - point evaluation of the partition function in the case of a self - interacting scalar field , it is possible to show that the temperature corrections to the nucleation barrier can be interpreted as entropic contributions due to stable vibrational modes on the _ tree - level _ bounce configuration , @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , the first corrections to the energy of the critical bubble configuration come from temperature induced stable fluctuations on the bubble , which will modify its volume and surface energies .",
    "we will show that these corrections are given by the temperature corrected effective action evaluated at the tree - level bounce @xmath6 . in expression ( [ badrate ] )",
    ", the bounce is obtained from the effective potential which includes scalar loops .",
    "the difference between the two nucleation barriers will be important whenever scalar loops are not negligible .",
    "we will show that they become particularly important within the so - called thin - wall limit , that is , in the vicinity of the critical temperature for the transition .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the fact that large entropic corrections are expected near the critical temperature .",
    "we will obtain this result by a perturbative evaluation of the determinantal prefactor . in principle",
    ", the determinantal prefactor can be evaluated in two ways .",
    "clearly , the computation can be done directly if we know the eigenvalues related to a given bubble configuration .",
    "this method is not very useful in practice , since we in general do not know the eigenvalues .",
    "( unless , of course , we obtain them numerically . )",
    "writing down explicitly the eingenvalue equations , and using a thin - wall approximation to the bubble configuration , we show how the temperature corrections to the nucleation barrier originate from fluctuations about the critical bubble configuration .",
    "even though the thin - wall approximation is not very useful in realistic situations , there is no reason to believe that thicker wall bubbles will behave any differently .",
    "( unless the transition becomes too weak , in which case nucleation of critical bubbles may not be the relevant mechanism for the transition @xcite . )",
    "the second approach we use to evaluate the prefactor relies on a perturbative expansion of the determinants . within first - order ,",
    "it is again possible to show how the prefactor accounts for the temperature corrections to the nucleation barrier .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review langer s formalism for obtaining nucleation rates , adapted to field theory at finite temperatures .",
    "that is , we obtain the partition function for the metastable phase plus a nucleating fluctuation by a saddle - point evaluation of the functional integral . in section 3",
    "we show how the determinantal prefactor can account for the finite temperature corrections to the nucleation barrier . for simplicity",
    ", the calculation is performed in the context of the thin - wall approximation for the bubble profile , although in principle one could obtain results for any configuration . in sections 2 and 3 , for the sake of clarity , the discussion is somewhat oversimplified .",
    "we _ assume _ that the system is initially in a metastable state and study only the scalar degrees of freedom in the problem .",
    "this situation is not unrealistic , as it can be reproduced in numerical simulations of vacuum decay @xcite . in section 4",
    "we study a model of a scalar field coupled to fermions .",
    "this example is particularly interesting as it illustrates how a thermal state evolves into a metastable state due to radiative corrections , very much like in the standard electroweak model .",
    "( recall that in a cosmological context the cooling is provided by the expansion of the universe . )",
    "a related problem has been recently studied by e. weinberg , in the context of massless scalar models for which symmetry breaking occurs due to radiative corrections . in the regime dominated by quantum fluctuations ,",
    "weinberg showed how radiative corrections induce a metastable state and how it is possible to evaluate its decay rate@xcite .",
    "we show how to obtain an effective partition function for the scalar field by integrating out the fermionic modes , and proceed to obtain the decay rate .",
