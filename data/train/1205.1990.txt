    "observations of diffuse gas have found a population of massive , fast moving clouds . with line - of - sight speeds between @xmath2",
    "km s@xmath3 and @xmath4 km s@xmath3 @xcite , they are appropriately named high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "these clouds are plentiful ; neutral hvc material covers @xmath5 of the sky @xcite while intermediately and highly ionized hvc material covers @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the sky , respectively @xcite .",
    "although some of the high velocity material is isolated , many of the clouds are grouped into large complexes .",
    "complex c , for example , stretches from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , while the magellanic stream runs along @xmath10 from @xmath11 to near the south galactic pole and then resumes again , running along @xmath12 from the south galactic pole to @xmath13 .",
    "several clouds are relatively near to the galactic plane . the smith cloud ( also called complex gcp ) ,",
    "complex a , the cohen stream , which is part of the anticenter complexes , and complex c are between @xmath14 and @xmath15  kpc , 2.5 and 7  kpc , @xmath15 and @xmath16  kpc , and 5 and 10  kpc , respectively , above or below the galactic midplane @xcite .",
    "these clouds are near enough to the plane to be interacting with the galaxy s thick disk / halo ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "cloud - ism interactions may be identified through anticorrelations with galactic h  at normal velocities @xcite , high ion ratios @xcite , and x - ray enhancements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite noted an excess soft x - ray surface brightness near high velocity h  gas in draco , a region now considered the southern part of complex c. later , @xcite reported excess 1/4  kev x - rays on the edge of complex m , @xcite noted excess 1/4  kev x - rays in the complex c region , and @xcite reported 1/4  kev excesses for complexes c , d , and gcn .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : complexcmap ] for our estimate of the complex c excess . ) generally , diffuse 1/4  kev x - rays are interpreted as tracers of @xmath17  k gas .",
    "a slight excess of somewhat more energetic x - rays has been reported for a sight line through the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "although the clouds in the magellanic stream are not interacting with the milky way s disk , they may be interacting with the extended halo or with gas ablated from preceding clouds in the stream .",
    "like @xcite , @xcite suggested that the excess x - rays may have been emitted by shock - heated gas .",
    "shock heating would be possible if the collision speed were multi - hundred km  s@xmath3 and the gas were initially warm or hot . for unmagnetized warm plasmas ,",
    "the post shock temperature would be @xmath18  k if the collision speed were @xmath19  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "such a speed may be achieved by magellanic stream clouds , given that the orbital velocity of the magellanic stream is @xmath20  km  s@xmath3 @xcite . as is the case for most hvcs",
    ", the impact speed of complex c is unknown .",
    "most hvcs have line - of - sight velocities @xmath21  km  s@xmath3 , but their total velocities may be much larger than their line - of - sight velocities if the angles between the hvcs velocities and the lines - of - sight are large .",
    "this is the case for the smith cloud , whose total velocity has been calculated from the variation in line - of - sight velocity as a function of observing angle and other observables to be @xmath4  km  s@xmath3 , while its line - of - sight velocity is only @xmath22  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , an hvc s currently observed velocity may be less than its velocity when it first encountered the galaxy .",
    "we examine the x - ray productivity of gas shocked by fast clouds in this paper .",
    "turbulent mixing should also be considered . as the cloud passes through the ambient medium ,",
    "shear instabilities develop at the contact surface .",
    "gas on either side of the interface mixes , resulting in a zone of intermediate temperature , intermediate density gas .",
    "this logic has been used to explain high ions associated with hvcs @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also consider the possibility that some of the transition zone gas may be hot enough and dense enough to yield observable quantities of x - rays .",
    "other potential mechanisms include magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "as high velocity clouds move through the halo and thick disk , they should deform and compress the magnetic field . @xcite",
    "suggest that shear between the cloud and the ambient plasma will turbulently mix the magnetic field in the region very near to the cloud .",
    "when these magnetic field lines reconnect , they release energy . @xcite performed analytic and resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the system finding that magnetic reconnections can release enough energy to heat the gas to @xmath23  k. because the magnetic reconnection scenario has already been examined with magnetohydrodynamic simulations , it is not simulated again in this paper .",
    "recently , additional ideas have been suggested . noting the x - rays emission that follows after charge exchange reactions in the heliosphere , @xcite suggest that charge exchange may be important at the interfaces between clouds and hot gas , and , noting the possible role of mhd plasma waves in heating the solar corona @xcite suggest that plasma waves instigated by collisions between high velocity clouds and halo gas may also be important .    in order to better understand hvcs , their interactions with the galaxy , and the possibility that they may induce x - rays , we perform flash magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the shock heating and turbulent mixing scenarios .",
    "our simulations begin with a cloud of similar size and h  column density as the lumps in complex c. in our simulations of the shock heating scenario , the cloud initially has a speed of @xmath24  km  s@xmath3 relative to the ambient gas .",
    "we examine the effect of ambient density , using moderate ( e.g. , @xmath25 atoms  @xmath26 ) and lower densities for the ambient gas .",
    "the moderately dense ambient medium may represent material ablated from a preceding hvc or a thick disk / halo cloud .",
    "we found that when @xmath27  km  s@xmath3 clouds interact with moderate density ambient media and radiative cooling is disabled , the shocked , compressed ambient medium yields extremely bright x - rays for @xmath28  myr .",
    "if , in contrast , radiative cooling proceeds at the collisional ionizational equilibrium ( cie ) rate , then the gas is only moderately bright and for only @xmath29  myr . in both the adiabatic and the radiatively cooling simulations",
    ", greater ambient densities resulted in greater emission intensities . in our turbulent mixing simulations",
    ", a cool cloud falls through hot halo gas that is in hydrostatic equilibrium . in the simulations having very hot ambient media ( @xmath30  k )",
    ", the mixed zone contains some @xmath31  k gas , which is hot enough to produce 1/4 kev x - rays in cie calculations .",
    "however , the mixed gas falls behind the cloud , into a region where the pressure and density are low .",
    "it is the low density that limits the x - ray production of this scenario , causing the surface brightnesses to be too small to be detectable .    in section  [",
    "sect : technique ] , we describe the modeling algorithms and list the simulational parameters . section  [ sect : results ] presents the results . in section",
    "[ subsect : cievsnei ] , we compare cie and non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) calculations , finding that the cie approximation yields similar 1/4 kev x - ray spectra to the nei calculations . in section  [ subsect :",
    "shockheating ] , we evaluate the ability of fast hvc collisions to shock heat the ambient gas and induce x - ray emission .",
    "the predictions include 1/4 kev surface brightnesses , o  and o  intensities , and o  column densities . in section  [ subsect :",
    "hotism ] , we evaluate the ability of turbulent mixing to create hot , x - ray emissive gas . section  [ subsect : obsappearance ] describes how the simulated clouds would appear to observers while section  [ subsect : resolution ] discusses higher and lower resolution simulations , concluding that the numerical resolutions used in our earlier simulations are adequate .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "we use similar hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic algorithms as in @xcite . to wit",
    ", we use the flash computer code , version 2.5 @xcite with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) to model the hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics of fast moving clouds and ambient gas . for our suite of cloud shock simulations (",
    "section  [ subsect : shockheating ] ) , we test the effects of radiative cooling by modeling it in some simulations but not others .",
    "the radiative cooling calculations are done with the flash module , which uses cooling rates for cie plasmas .",
    "we do not simulate gravity in our cloud shock simulations , but instead start the cloud with a large initial velocity .",
    "we do the same in our cie testing ( section  [ subsect : cievsnei ] ) and resolution experiments ( section  [ subsect : resolution ] ) . in our turbulent mixing simulations",
    "( section  [ subsect : hotism ] ) we use the gravity module in flash and the expression for gravitational acceleration presented in @xcite to establish hydrostatic equilibrium in the background gas and to simulate the milky way s gravitational pull on the cloud . in order to maintain hydrostatic balance in the background gas , radiative cooling must be disallowed and is so in the turbulent mixing simulations .",
    "it is not needed in the cie testing and so is disabled in them as well . in two of our simulations ,",
    "we model a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the cloud s motion .",
    "the others have no magnetic field . for the purposes of the magnetohydrodynamics ,",
    "we treat all of the gas as if it is fully ionized in all of our simulations .",
    "thermal conduction is not modeled .",
    "the predictions of the x - ray count rates and very high ion column densities require predictions of the fractions of ions in any given state in the gas .",
    "we calculate the ion fractions using collisional ionizational equilibrium ( cie ) and/or partially non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models . in the cie models ,",
    "the ionization levels are calculated from the temperature of the simulated gas , using the raymond and smith code ( @xcite , with updates ) . for the nei models , we enable flash to track the ionization levels of select elements as a function of time by accounting for their collisional ionization and recombination during each timestep . ionization and recombination rates from @xcite",
    "we limit our nei calculations to only two elements , silicon and oxygen , in order to economize on cpu and memory .",
    "silicon is a major contributer to x - ray spectra in the 1/4 kev band , while oxygen is an important contributer in the 3/4  kev band . in section  [ subsect : cievsnei ] , we show that cie models adequately approximate the nei models .    in our cie tests (",
    "section  [ subsect : cievsnei ] ) , shock heating analysis ( section  [ subsect : shockheating ] ) , and turbulent mixing analysis ( sections  [ subsect : hotism ] ) , we use a 3 dimensional cartesian coordinate system with width ( span in the @xmath32 direction ) , and depth ( span in the @xmath33 direction ) of 1.5  kpc and 1.5  kpc , respectively .",
    "the footprint is centered on @xmath34  kpc , @xmath35  kpc .",
    "most of these simulations use a domain that is 6  kpc tall .",
    "the exceptions are the high resolution , radiatively cooling , shock scenario simulations , for which we reduced the domain height to 1.5  kpc . in the turbulent mixing simulations ,",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium is achieved by decreasing the thermal pressure with height above the midplane .",
    "we set the physical conditions at the base of the domain to simulate those in the ism at @xmath36  kpc , thus in these simulations the domain runs from @xmath36 to 14  kpc . in the remaining simulations ,",
    "there are no gravitational , density , pressure , or magnetic field gradients in the modeled ambient gas .",
    "thus , an arbitrary @xmath37 offset can be added to the height along the @xmath37 axis . for these simulations ,",
    "we choose to call the lower boundary @xmath37 = 0  kpc , only for convenience . in the shock models that had",
    "no radiative cooling , each domain is initially segmented into 4 blocks .",
    "each block is subdivided by the amr routine an additional 3 to 5 times , with the number of subdivisions depending upon the density gradient . with 5 levels of refinement ,",
    "the resulting blocks are @xmath38  pc , on a side , while with 3 levels of refinement they are @xmath39 on a side .",
    "each of these blocks is segmented into 8@xmath40 zones , which , consequently , range in size from ( 12  pc)@xmath40 to ( 47  pc)@xmath40 . like the shock models that had no cooling ,",
    "some of our shock models that had cooling also had moderate resolution and 6  kpc tall domains initially made from 4 blocks , while others used higher resolution and a single 1.5  kpc tall block that was subdivided an additional 3 to 7 times depending upon the density gradient .",
    "these blocks were then subdivided into 8@xmath40 zones that range in size from ( 2.9  pc)@xmath40 to ( 47  pc)@xmath40 . for our resolution tests (",
    "section  [ subsect : resolution ] ) , we use both 3 dimensional cartesian domains and 2 dimensional cylindrically symmetric domains and test maximum refinement levels between 4 and 8 .",
    "we calculate each zone s emission spectrum using the raymond and smith spectral code ( @xcite , with updates ) , the gas density calculated by flash , the ionization levels from either the cie or the nei calculations , and @xcite cosmic abundances .",
    "the allen abundances are greater than the gas phase abundances in the halo and clouds .",
    "for example , the gas phase metal abundances in the warm halo are @xmath41 of the allen solar abundances @xcite , while the gas phase oxygen abundance in complex c is about @xmath42 to @xmath43 of the allen solar values @xcite , and the gas phase metal abundances in magellanic stream clouds are @xmath44 of the allen solar values @xcite .",
    "the strength of the emitted spectra should be scaled accordingly , bearing in mind that in the shock scenario ( the most x - ray productive scenario ) , the x - rays originate in the ambient gas and that over time , collisions in hot gas break down dust .    in order to obtain the spectrum pertaining to any given line - of - sight , we sum the spectra from the intersected zones .",
    "if the zones have differing sizes , we weight the terms accordingly .",
    "the x - ray spectra are convolved with the _ rosat _  response matrix in order to determine the count rate in the _ rosat _",
    "r12 band , the 1/4  kev energy band . for the brighter models ,",
    "we also report intensities at the photon energies of the o   triplet ( @xmath45  ev ) and o  lyman alpha line ( 653  ev ) . during our line intensity calculations",
    ", we do not subtract the continuum or the pseudo - continuum composed of faint , unresolved lines , because they account for @xmath46 of the emission in these energy bins during the brightest phases .",
    "they account for a greater fraction of the intensity when the gas is dimmer , but at these times , the reported intensity is too dim to be observed .",
    "in addition , for comparison with the observed x - ray excess associated with a magellanic stream cloud ( @xcite ; @xmath47 counts  ks@xmath3  arcmin@xmath48 seen by the _ xmm - newton _  pn detector in 0.4 to 1.0  kev x - rays ) , we calculate the xmm pn count rate for four of our shock models .",
    "we calculate the density of o   ions for select models by combining the fraction of oxygen in the o  ionization state with the oxygen abundance and the gas density in each zone .",
    "we integrate the density along sight lines through the domain in order to obtain o   column densities . again",
    ", the results can be scaled if elemental abundances other than those of @xcite are preferred .",
    "+      we initialize the 6 kpc tall domains such that a spherical cloud is located in the upper portion of the grid and is surrounded by stationary ambient gas . in the 1.5 kpc tall domains , the center of the cloud is initially located at 2/3 of the height of the domain . at the beginning of each simulation , the cloud has a radius of 0.2  kpc , which corresponds to 1.1  if the cloud is seen from the current distance to complex c ( 10 kpc ; @xcite ) . in most of our simulations , the cloud s initial volume density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath49 , is @xmath50  @xmath26 .",
    "note that the simulations assume a 10 to 1 ratio of hydrogen to helium , making the mass density @xmath51  amu  @xmath26 and note that the number density shown in the figures and quoted in the text is the number of hydrogens per unit volume .",
    "we choose an initial hydrogen volume density of @xmath50  @xmath26 because clouds with this density and a radius of 0.2  kpc have hydrogen column densities along sight lines through their centers of @xmath52  h  cm@xmath48 , which is similar to the observed h  column density in small features within complex c. initial cloud temperatures range from 100  k to @xmath54  k and are chosen from the constraint that the cloud s initial thermal pressure must balance the initial thermal pressure of the gas around it . in our cases with magnetic fields ,",

    "even the @xmath141  km  s@xmath3 cloud induces bright x - rays in the non radiatively cooled simulations and some x - rays in the radiatively cooled simulations .",
    "these x - rays are from gas that was shock - heated to @xmath142  k. the faster clouds shock - heat the ism to higher temperatures . as a result , they produce more 1/4 kev x - rays for longer periods of time ( see figure  [ fig:1/4kevevolution ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the o  and o  intensities , which are modest in models ba2 and ba3 , become stronger in models ba4 , 5 , and 6 ( see figure  [ fig : ovii_oviii ] ) . because the shock heated gas is more highly ionized in the faster models , the column densities of o  and o  are also larger ( see figure  [ fig : ovii_oviiicolden ] ) .",
    "+      the density of the environmental gas affects the hydrodynamics and production of 1/4  kev x - rays in multiple ways .",

    "analytical calculations and computational simulations have already shown that mixed layers are rich in high ions , such as o   @xcite . in order to determine whether or not mixing zones between hvcs and very hot gas can also be x - ray productive",
    ", we simulate the hydrodynamics of 3 dimensional clouds passing through hot , rarefied gas .",

    "the names of these simulations begin with a.    in order to model the interaction adequately , the simulations must resolve the mixing length scale .",
    "interstellar turbulence may exist across a wide range of length scales , but the largest length scale dominates the mixing @xcite . in our case , the largest length scale is the height of the distorted cloud .",
    "this height and width are adequately resolved in our model a  simulations , which , when fully resolved , use @xmath146 zones to model a 400  pc span ( the nominal height of the interaction zone in figure  [ fig : cloudwithears ] ) .",
    "+      our simulations do not include thermal conduction , but @xcite found that turbulent diffusion is much more effective than thermal conduction at leveling the temperature gradient .",
    "thus , our omission of thermal conduction is not problematic .",
    "note , also , that radiative cooling has not been allowed in the model a  simulations .",
    "it was disallowed in order to maintain hydrostatic balance in the background gas .",
    "the ramifications of cooling are too complicated for us to simply say that adding cooling would lower the radiation rates of the turbulently mixed gas .",

    "the latter is the brightest rate for model a1 at any time .",
    "note that these are intrinsic count rates ; absorption by @xmath154 cm@xmath48 would decrease them by factors of @xmath155 .",
    "even without absorption , the small count rate enhancements would be inconspicuous against the diffuse x - ray background .",
    "the timescale for the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities decreases as the cloud falls and the density contrast between the cloud and the ambient gas decreases . for the last @xmath156  myr of the simulation",
    ", we estimate that the timescale for the growth of instabilities is @xmath157  myr , from @xcite section 101 , and assuming that instabilities grow on similar timescales in plane parallel geometries as in our geometry .",
    "hence , the lack of x - rays due to turbulent mixing in our simulations is unlikely to be due to the instabilities having insufficient time to grow .",
    "models that simulate a larger ambient temperature ( models a4 and a11 ) , a greater ambient pressure ( models a5 and a11 ) , faster initial speeds ( models a2 , a8 , a9 , and a10 ) , denser clouds ( model a11 ) , less dense clouds ( models a3 and a10 ) , and nonzero magnetic fields ( models a6 and a7 ) were also simulated . of the slow models ( initial @xmath158  km  s@xmath3 ) the greatest x - ray enhancement seen anywhere in the domain at any time during the simulations is @xmath159 counts  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath48 .",

    "some of the fast models ( initial @xmath162 or 400  km  s@xmath3 ) create brighter disturbances .",
    "model a9 , for example , has a peak enhancement of @xmath163 counts  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath48 at 8  myr , which is the last epoch before the cloud leaves the domain .",
    "the bright region is fairly extended , with a radius of 740  pc ( with the cut off being defined where the count rate exceeds the background by 5@xmath164 ) over which the count rate averages @xmath165 counts  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath48 .",
    "while an excess of this magnitude and spatial extent may be observable , it is not due to turbulent mixing .",
    "it is due to the shock .",
    "likewise , the shock in model  a8 created a bright region , whose maximum average brightness was @xmath166 counts  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath48 over a 200  pc radius footprint at 10  myr , the last epoch before the cloud left the grid .",
    "again , the x - rays are due to the shock , not the mixed material .    here",
    "we consider the dynamics of the mixed gas and how they lead to x - ray dimness .",
    "although our models develop a mixed zone , as expected , and although the mixed zone contains some hot gas , in several models ( a1 - a3 and a5 - a10 ) too little of the mixed gas was sufficiently hot ( i.e. , @xmath167 nearing @xmath57  k ) to be x - ray emissive and even when the temperature was sufficiently high , as it was in models a4 and a11 , the mixed gas fell behind the clouds into the semi - vacuum created by the cloud s passage . here",
    "the density was not sufficient for great emissivity .",
    "model a11 provides an example of the varying conditions and low pressure in the ablated material ( see figure  [ fig : cloudwithears ] ) . within the trailing stream the temperature and density vary from hot ( @xmath168  k ) but diffuse ( stream density @xmath169 of the density in the undisturbed halo gas at this height ) near the surface of the stream to only mildly hot ( @xmath170  k ) but denser ( stream density @xmath171 of the density in the undisturbed gas ) in the core . the pressures in these example locations are @xmath172 those of the ambient gas .",
    "the enhancement due to turbulent mixing by a single cloud is modest when compared with the typical x - ray count rate for high latitude sight lines .",
    "scattered clouds may contribute unidentifiably to the soft x - ray background and multiple , aligned clouds could create a non - negligible x - ray surface brightness . however , obtaining bright x - rays from individual clouds requires fast speeds as discussed in the preceding section .    like the suites of ba , br , and c  models , the suite of a models radiates more prolifically in the uv than in the x - ray .",
    "the broadband spectra are several orders of magnitude brighter in the far uv than in the soft x - ray .",
    "the ultimate source of this energy is the reservoir of thermal energy in the hot ambient gas . mixing with the ablated cloud material has lowered the temperature and ionization level of the neighboring hot gas such that it has become highly emissive , especially in the uv .",
    "+      to the observer who looks straight upwards at an incoming hvc , the x - ray bright region would extend for at least 200  pc from the center of the cloud , thus 400  pc in diameter .",
    "if the observer is not located directly beneath the cloud , then the bright region would be somewhat displaced from the cloud itself and would subtend a smaller angle in the direction along the cloud s motion . if the clouds were as far away as complex c , which is located @xmath173  kpc from earth , then the 400  pc diameter x - ray bright footprint due to a single cloudlet would subtend only a 2  angle .",
    "such a small feature can not be easily examined with _ rosat _  all sky survey ( rass ) data .",
    "however , the overlapping footprints of many bright clouds in an ensemble , could create an extended x - ray bright region that should be compared with the rass maps .",
    "if complex c is composed of such an ensemble , then we can estimate the average 1/4  kev count rate across the complex . here",
    "we examine the cases in which the x - rays result from shock heating by assuming that the individual clouds within complex c are like model ba3 or br3 clouds ; faster models would result in greater x - ray count rates while slower models or more cooling would result in lower count rates .",
    "any gas that was ablated from the clouds and mixed with the ambient medium would also be dim .",
    "the expected count rate is a product of the count rate of a single cloud when viewed from below ( @xmath174 ) , the number of such clouds ( @xmath175 ) , and a scaling factor ( @xmath176 ) that accounts for the dilution of the surface brightness over the larger area of complex c. for model ba3 , at its brightest epoch , the average 1/4  kev surface brightness , @xmath174 , within a circular extraction region of radius 400  pc ( this is twice as large as the previously mentioned extraction region , in order to capture more of the photons ) is 3600 @xmath115 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath48 in the _ rosat _",

    "not only does this factor account for dilution , but it also accounts for the concentration of the x - rays when the viewing angle results in a foreshortened cross section . combining @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 yields a theoretical intrinsic r12 count rate of @xmath187 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath48 for the case in which the clouds are like those in model ba3 and @xmath188 counts",

    "+      in order to examine the effects of computational resolution we calculate additional versions of models ba3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 and model br3 using lesser and greater numbers of refinement levels than in the foregoing simulations , i.e. , in flash , we use lrefine@xmath197max = 4 and 6 , for the additional model ba3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 simulations , rather than the value of 5 used in the primary simulations discussed in previous sections of the paper .",
    "we follow a similar pattern for comparison with the moderate resolution model br3 simulations , but also use lrefine@xmath197max = 5 and 6 when making simulations for comparison with the high resolution model br3 simulations , which used lrefine@xmath197max = 7 .",
    "we find that within this range , the refinement level does not affect the timescale on which the clouds fragment , although it does affect the shapes of the clouds and of the x - ray bright regions . in order to compare the x - ray productivities of the various simulations , we extract the 1/4 kev x - ray count rates within circular regions of radius equal to 400  pc for the case ba  simulations and 200  pc for the comparisons with the case br  simulations .",
    "( we set the footprints for the case ba  simulations to be greater than those used in earlier parts of this paper in order to capture all or nearly all of the downward directed flux . )",
    "we extract these count rates from every epoch in the model ba4-like simulations , every epoch from the model br3-like simulations that were made for comparison with the primary moderate resolution model br3 simulation , every epoch from the simulations that were made for comparison with the high resolution model br2 , 3 , and 4 simulations , and the @xmath198  myr epoch from the model ba3 , 4 , 5 , and 6-like simulations .",
    "we then compare our resolution experiment simulations with the control simulations having the same initial cloud velocity .",
    "the x - ray count rates vary somewhat between our test simulations , but in almost all cases are within @xmath199 of that of the relevant control simulation . frequently , they are much closer to those of the control simulations",
    ". we also examined 2-dimensional cylindrically symmetric simulations using maximum refinement levels of 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "the principle advantage of this configuration is that it allows much smaller zone sizes .",
    "the principle disadvantage is that 2-d simulations are not able to track azimuthal instabilities @xcite .",
    "lacking azimuthal modulation , the cloud material concentrates along the symmetry axis and resists fragmentation until later times than in the 3-d simulations . in general , the 2-dimensional simulations predict similar x - ray count rates as the 3-dimensional simulations , but with greater variation between runs having different refinement levels .",
    "we performed a series of hydrodynamic simulations aimed at understanding the x - ray productivity of hvcs .",
    "we examined two types of interactions , shock heating and mixing between cloud and ambient gas .",
    "we also examined the effect of using cie ionization levels on the x - ray count rates , finding the 1/4 kev count rates to be similar to those in which we tracked the ionization levels in a time dependent fashion , and we examined the effect of radiative cooling in the shock scenario , finding it to be very important .",
    "we found that shock heating is far more effective at inducing x - ray emission than turbulent mixing .",
    "clouds with sufficiently fast initial speeds ( @xmath200  km  s@xmath3 ) shock heat the ambient gas to temperatures of @xmath201  k and clouds with initial speeds of @xmath202  km  s@xmath3 shock heat the ambient gas to @xmath203  k. barring radiative cooling , the former case produces large numbers of 1/4  kev x - rays while the latter produces both large numbers of 1/4 kev x - rays and significant numbers of 3/4 kev x - rays .",
    "when radiative cooling is allowed , the timeframe for bright emission moves forward and constricts",
    ". the emission rates also decrease , but some emission is predicted in the 1/4 kev band for @xmath204  km  s@xmath3 collisions and in the 3/4 kev band for @xmath205  km  s@xmath3 collisions .",
    "predictions for o  column densities and intensities are also provided .",
    "the predicted x - rays originate in the shocked , compressed ambient gas , not in the cloud ; the reverse shock is not strong enough to elevate the cloud s temperature to @xmath18  k. although shocked clouds are too cool and insufficiently ionized to be x - ray emissive ,",
    "they may be of interest for observations of medium and high ions . predictions from the shock - heating scenario were compared with x - ray count rates observed near complex c and ms30.7 - 81.4 - 118 , a cloud in the magellanic stream .",
    "moderate density in the ambient medium is required in order for the shocked - gas to be bright enough to be observed and so it is possible that high velocity clouds only `` light - up '' upon colliding with moderately dense ( @xmath206  h  @xmath26 in models ba1 , br1 , and c1 ) material such as that in the thick disk , galactic interstellar clouds , or material ablated from preceding hvcs .",
    "furthermore , the physical conditions of the halo are not fully understood and vary from location to location .",
    "our finite set of simulations can not reproduce the full spectrum of physical conditions in the halo , but , instead , provide insights into the possible effects of cloud collisions with gas in the halo .",
    "our simulations of turbulent mixing between cloud and ambient material predict some x - ray production , but the x - ray count rates are relatively low unless the clouds move fast enough to also shock heat the ambient gas . excluding cases in which the x - rays originate in shock - heated gas , our brightest model in this suite of simulations produces a 1/4 kev x - ray enhancement of only @xmath159 counts s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath48 , which is a small fraction of that seen in the complex c enhancement ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : complexcmap ] ) .",
    "this comes from a simulation that has a very hot environment ( @xmath30  k ) , moderately dense cloud and ambient gas ( @xmath69 and @xmath207  h @xmath26 , respectively ) , and no radiative cooling . the very high temperature in the environmental gas is needed in order to raise that of the mixed gas , such that some mixed gas has @xmath208  k. the reason why maximizing the output from this scenario requires moderately dense cloud and ambient gas is because the mixed gas falls behind the cloud , where the thermal pressure is comparatively low .",
    "moderate initial densities somewhat compensate for the dimming effects of this low pressure .",
    "although the interaction zone is not especially bright in x - rays , it is rich in high ions .",
    "see @xcite for c  , n  , and o  predictions .",
