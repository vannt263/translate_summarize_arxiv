    "<S> we establish a new approach for pump - probe simulations of metallic metamaterials coupled to the gain materials . </S>",
    "<S> it is of vital importance to understand the mechanism of the coupling of metamaterials with the gain medium . using a four - level gain system , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied light amplification of arrays of metallic split - ring resonators ( srrs ) with a gain layer underneath . </S>",
    "<S> we find that that the differential transmittance @xmath0 can be negative for srrs on the top of the gain substrate , which is not expected , and @xmath0 is positive for the gain substrate alone . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations agree with pump - probe experiments and can help to design new experiments to compensate the losses of metamaterials </S>",
    "<S> .    the field of metamaterials has been spectacular experiments progress in recent years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mostly metamaterial are metal - based nano - structure and eventually suffering from the conductor losses at optical frequencies , which are stills orders of magnitude too large for the realistic applications . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , metamaterial losses become an increasingly important issue when moving from multiple metal - based metamaterial layers to the bulk case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the need for reducing or even compensating of the losses is a key challenge for metamaterial technologies . </S>",
    "<S> one promising way of overcoming the losses is based on introducing the gain material to the metamaterial . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of combination of a metamaterial with an optical gain material has been investigated by several theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite . from the experiments point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the realistic gain can be experimentally realized with fluorescent dyes @xcite , quantum dots @xcite or semiconductor quantum wells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these loss - compensation are mainly attributed to the coupling between metamaterial and the gain medium . without sufficient coupling , </S>",
    "<S> no loss - compensation can happen , nor can the transmitted signal be amplified . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is of vital importance to understand the mechanism of the coupling between metamaterial and the gain medium . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these ideas can be used in plasmonics to incorporate gain @xcite to obtain new nano - plasmonic lasers @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present a systematic theoretical model for pump - probe experiments of metallic metamaterials coupled with the gain material , described by a generic four - level atomic system . we describe the dynamical processes in metamaterials with gain , and increasing the gain changes the metamaterials properties and we need to have self - consistent calculations @xcite to reach a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the pump - probe results affecting the time dependence of the population inversion and the electric field enhancement that increases the effective gain . we observe differential transmittance signals from the coupled system that are larger than for the bare gain . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe a more rapid temporal decay of the differential transmittance signal for the coupled system compared to the bare gain . </S>",
    "<S> both effects indicate substantial local - field - enhancement effects , which increase the effective metamaterial gain beyond the bare gain , leading to a significant reduction of the metamaterial s losses .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the dispersive lorentz active medium using a generic four - level atomic system . </S>",
    "<S> the population density in each level is given by @xmath1 ( @xmath2=0,1,2,3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent maxwell s equations for isotropic media are given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the dispersive electric polarization density that corresponds to the transitions between two atomic levels , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the vectors @xmath10 introduces gain in maxwell s equations and its time evolution can be shown to follow that of a homogeneously broadened lorentzian oscillator driven by the coupling between the population inversion and external electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath10 obeys the equation of motion @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the linewidth of the atomic transitions at @xmath13 , and accounts for both the nonradiative energy decay rate , as well as dephasing processes that arise from incoherently driven polarizations . in the following simulations , this value is equal to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the coupling strength of @xmath10 to the external electric field and its value is taken to be @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath17 is the population inversion between level @xmath18 and level @xmath19 that drives the polarization @xmath10 .        in order to do pump - probe experiments </S>",
    "<S> numerically we first pump the gain material with a short , intense gaussian pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> after a suitable time delay we probe the structure with a weak probe pulse ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> an external mechanism pumps electrons from the ground state level @xmath20 to the third level @xmath21 using a gaussian pumping @xmath22 , which is proportional to the pumping intensity in the experiments . after a short lifetime @xmath23 electrons transfer non - radiative into metastable second level @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the second level ( @xmath9 ) and the first level ( @xmath8 ) are called the upper and lower lasing levels . </S>",
    "<S> electrons can be transferred from the upper to the lower lasing level by spontaneous and stimulated emission . at last , electrons transfer quickly and non - radiative from the first level ( @xmath8 ) to the ground state level ( @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetimes and energies of the upper and lower lasing levels are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the center frequency of the radiation is @xmath26 which is a controlled variable chosen according to the pump - probe experiments . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the atomic population densities obey the following rate equations : @xmath31 where gaussian pump @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xcite , and @xmath35 .    in order to solve the response of the active materials in the electromagnetic fields numerically , </S>",

    "<S> , we probe the structure with a weak gaussian probe pulse with a center frequency close to the srrs resonance frequency of @xmath51 . typical examples for the spatial distribution of electric field </S>",
    "<S> an gain are shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the incident electric field amplitude of the probe pulse is @xmath55 , which is well inside the linear response regime . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can fourier transform the time - dependent transmitted electric field and divide by the fourier transform of the incident probe pulse to obtain the spectral transmittance of the system as seen by the probe pulse . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we obtain the total pulse transmittance by dividing the energy in the transmitted pulse by the energy in the incident pulse , integrated in time domain . </S>",
    "<S> we define the differential transmittance , @xmath0 , by taking the difference of the measured total plus transmittance with pumping the active structure minus the same without pumping and dividing it by the total plus transmittance without pumping . </S>",
    "<S> this differential transmittance is a function of the pump - probe delay . </S>",

    "<S> for parallel polarization , the light does couple to the fundamental srrs resonance , for perpendicular polarization it does not . </S>",
    "<S> the probe center frequency decreases from top ( 179thz ) to bottom ( 169thz ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the width of the probe spectrum is @xmath18thz ( see the insert of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the data have been taken with @xmath18-thz spectral separation . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the left column shows a rather different behavior for the srrs with gain compared to the bare gain case . while the bare gain always delivers positive @xmath0 signals below @xmath57 ( right column ) over the whole probe spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) , neither in the magnitude nor in the dynamics of the @xmath0 , can be detected .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue the distinct behavior can be attributed to the strong coupling between the resonances of the srrs and the gain medium . </S>",
    "<S> the negative @xmath0 are not as we expected at first glance : the pump lifts electrons from ground state to an excited state so that the absorption of the probe pulse is reduced , leading to an increase of transmission . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the whole story . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies in the fact that with pump we not only affect the absorption , but disturb the reflection of the structure , resulting in the mismatching of the impedance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observed either increasing or decreasing tendency for the case of on resonance as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all those behaviors can be explained by the competing of the weak gain resonance and the impedance mismatching between pump and without pump cases . </S>",
