    "x - ray spectra of seyfert  1 galaxies commonly show an iron k@xmath1 emission line at @xmath36kev .",
    "the line is often extremely broad , with a velocity width of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetries in the line profiles are well explained by relativistic effects . both of these facts suggest that the line is emitted from the surface layers of the accretion disk within a few gravitational radii @xmath5 of the black hole ( bh ) itself .",
    "it is now widely believed that this spectral feature is a relatively clean probe of the immediate environments of supermassive bhs ( see fabian et al . , 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "one of the best studied broad iron line sources is the nearby bright seyfert  1 galaxy mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this was the first active galactic nucleus ( agn ) for which a relativistic iron line disk profile was measured . in their _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( asca ) observations , tanaka et al . found that the iron line profile could be explained by emission from an accretion disk around a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) bh . in a detailed reanalysis ,",
    "however , iwasawa et al . found a much broader line during a period of low continuum x - ray flux , the so - called `` deep minimum state '' .",
    "the line becomes so broad that disk models require emission from within @xmath7 , suggesting either a rotating ( kerr ) bh , with its marginally stable orbit at @xmath8 ( iwasawa et al .",
    ", 1996 , dabrowski et al . ,",
    "1997 ) , or iron fluorescence from material spiraling into the bh at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "such a broad line has later been confirmed , e.g. , by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    using the new generation of x - ray satellites such as _ xmm - newton _ with their improved collecting area and x - ray ccd spectral resolution , the fe line of seyferts can be studied in greater detail than was possible before . in this _",
    "letter _ , we present data from a 100ksec _ xmm - newton _ observation of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 .",
    "our observation covered most of _ xmm - newton _ s orbit 108 , on 2000 june 11/12 , and was simultaneous with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) . here",
    ", we report on data from the european photon imaging cameras onboard _ xmm - newton _",
    "( epic , strder et al . , 2001 ,",
    "turner et al . , 2001 ) . to prevent photon pile - up ,",
    "the epic - pn camera was operated in its small window mode ( using the medium thick filter to prevent optical light contamination ) , and the epic mos-1 camera was operated in its timing mode .",
    "the mos-2 camera was operated in full - frame mode to study the field surrounding mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 .",
    "although we primarily rely on the pn - data here , the pile - up in the mos-2 data can be reduced to @xmath10 when using single events only .",
    "therefore , we can use the mos-2 data to check for the instrument - independency of our results .    as of 2001",
    "august , the official version of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas ) only contained a preliminary model for the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) of the pn - chips .",
    "therefore , we used an internal sas version implementing an improved model for the epic - pn cte ( haberl , priv .",
    "comm . ) . to avoid remaining response matrix uncertainties , we concentrate on the energy range from 0.5 to 11kev . to produce epic - pn source and background spectra , we collected events from two circles of radius 10  pixels on and off the source for those times where the source count rate was below @xmath11 .",
    "this upper limit of the count rate is necessary to avoid phases where the core of the mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 point spread function was slightly piled up .",
    "the total resulting epic integration time was 54ksec .",
    "we checked the background lightcurve for periods of severely increased background , but none were found .    for spectral modeling ,",
    "response matrices appropriate for the improved cte model and appropriate for the source position on the epic chip were used .",
    "furthermore , we corrected the exposure time in the spectra for the @xmath371% livetime of the pn small window mode @xcite and perform simultaneous fits with single and double events .",
    "we estimate that the overall uncertainties in the spectral calibration and flux calibration due to these procedures are at most a few percent .",
    "figure  [ fig : fits]a shows the ratio of the 0.511kev epic - pn data to a spectral model consisting of a pure power - law ( fitted in the 211kev band ) modified by galactic absorption ( @xmath12 , using the xspec phabs model with cross - sections similar to those described by wilms , allen , & mccray , 2000 ) . below @xmath13kev , there is significant spectral complexity which is due to a warm absorber ( nandra & pounds 1994 , reynolds & fabian 1995 , lee et al .",
    "2001 ) , possibly superposed with a complex of relativistically broadened soft x - ray recombination lines @xcite . at 37kev , a broad hump in the spectrum suggests the identification with disk reflection signatures and , especially , the broad iron k@xmath1 line .",
    "the putative broad iron line is more apparent once the soft x - ray spectral complexity has been modeled .",
    "this is not a trivial exercise since the physical nature of this complexity is still a matter of debate . to start with",
    ", we consider a warm absorber scenario ( this will be generalized to include soft x - ray relativistic emission lines below ) .",
    "we assume that the continuum consists of a power - law modified by galactic absorption .",
    "we also allow for the possibility of intrinsic neutral absorption in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 ( although the best fitting column density is always consistent with zero ) . by fitting the high resolution x - ray spectrum from the reflection grating spectrograph ( rgs )",
    ", we construct an empirical warm absorber model ( based on lee et al .",
    "2001 ) with absorption edges of cv , ovii , oviii , and nex ( at 392ev , 740ev , 870ev , and 1362ev , respectively , with best fitting optical depths at threshold of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) , a gaussian absorption feature below the ovii and oviii edges to crudely model blended resonance absorption lines , and four moderately broad and weak gaussian emission features at observed energies of @xmath18kev , @xmath19kev , @xmath20kev , and @xmath21kev , which are merely included to fit the rgs data ; we do not attempt to make a physical identification of these features . after applying this empirical model to the data ,",
    "the soft x - ray residuals are reduced to less than @xmath22 , and the broad iron line feature is much more obvious ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fits]b ) .",
    "the best fit photon index is @xmath23 ( goodness of fit @xmath24 , all uncertainties are quoted at the 90% level for one interesting parameter , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we now consider the nature of the hard spectral complexity .",
    "while it may be tempting to model the hump - like feature as pure broad iron line emission , this is not a physically consistent model .",
    "the equivalent width of this feature ( measured relative to the continuum at the iron k@xmath1 rest - frame energy ) is @xmath26kev , and it would be impossible to obtain such a broad iron line without also observing the x - ray continuum photons that have been backscattered from the accretion disk .",
    "consequently , we will not present pure broad iron line models and jump , instead , to more physically motivated spectral models which include both iron line fluorescence and the backscattered `` reflection '' continuum . within the framework of such models ,",
    "the 37kev hump is a combination of iron line fluorescence and backscattered continuum photons ( with the fe k edge responsible for some fraction of the drop in flux at @xmath27kev ) .",
    "we construct a spectral model appropriate for the case of reflection from the keplerian regions of an accretion disk around a near - extremal kerr black hole ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the inner edge of the x - ray reprocessing region is taken to be the radius of marginal stability , @xmath29 , and the outer edge is taken to be @xmath30 .",
    "we fix the inclination of the inner disk to be @xmath31 ( tanaka et al . , 1995 ) and note that our results below only slightly depend on the value of @xmath32 chosen .",
    "we assume that the reflected emission has an emissity profile @xmath33 and leave @xmath34 as a free parameter .",
    "the reflection continuum is described using the pexriv model of xspec and normalized to the case where the accretion disk intercepts half of the x - ray power - law continuum photons ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) . both , the iron line profile and the reflection continuum are then relativistically smeared ( using the model of laor , 1991 , as the kernel ) . here , and",
    "throughout the rest of the spectral modeling discussed in this paper , we also include a narrow ( unresolved ) gaussian line at 6.4kev with equivalent width @xmath36 to model the obvious narrow line core .",
    "this component presumably originates from distant material such as the putative molecular torus of seyfert unification schemes , and has recently be seen in several other agn ( e.g. , in ngc  5548 , yaqoob et al . , 2001 , or in mkn  205 , reeves et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "firstly , we consider the case of a fairly cold accretion disk ( rest - frame iron line energy of 6.4kev , disk ionization parameter @xmath37 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the resulting best fitting parameters are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40ev , and @xmath41ev ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , this model fails to explain the data as well as possessing an unphysically large broad line equivalent width .",
    "significant residuals ( up to @xmath43 ) remain in the 311kev band .",
    "the pattern of residuals suggest that the model is failing to produce the red - wing of the 37kev hump , and is underestimating the flux in the blueward edge of this feature .",
    "a hard tail above 8kev suggests that we are also underestimating the strength of the high energy reflection continuum .",
    "if we allow the relative normalization of the reflection continuum , @xmath44 , to be a free parameter , the fit converges to a very large value of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , also @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) . despite the slightly better @xmath49 , large residuals around @xmath37kev",
    "remain .",
    "ionization of the accretion disk surface is another way of increasing the amount of reflection continuum . to model this ( with the relative normalization of the reflection continuum fixed to @xmath35 ) , we allow the ionization parameter of the disk @xmath50 , the temperature of the disk @xmath51 and the energy of the iron line @xmath52 to be free parameters ( @xmath52 is constrained to lie in the range of allowable fe-@xmath53 energies ; 6.40kev to 6.97kev ) .",
    "the resulting best fit has @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56kev , @xmath57 , @xmath58k , @xmath59ev , and @xmath60ev ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this leads to a significantly better fit with the higher iron edge / line energies explaining the residual at @xmath27kev .",
    "however , significant residuals still exist in the 35kev range ( suggesting that we are still under - predicting the flux in the red - wing of the reflection feature ) and above 8kev .",
    "detailed examination of this last spectral model shows that features in the _ soft _ x - ray band below 1.5kev determine the best fitting ionization parameter and temperature .",
    "consequently , such fits must be viewed with suspicion  there are a number of physical processes which are not included in this reflection model but which may well contribute to the soft x - ray spectrum ( most notably , the recombination line and edge emission from c , n , o , and ne )",
    ". it would also not be surprising if our empirical warm absorber model left small soft x - ray residuals which may then be mistakenly fit by ionized reflection models .",
    "firstly , we can consider the ionized reflection fits ignoring all data below 1.5kev . refitting the ionized disk model ( including the empirical warm absorber ) to the 1.511kev band results in a good fit with no clear residuals .",
    "the best fitting parameters are : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64kev , @xmath65ev , and @xmath66ev ( @xmath67 ) . @xmath51 and @xmath50 are unconstrained by the data , while the relative normalization of the reflection continuum is constrained to be @xmath68 . during the fitting @xmath44 is anti - correlated with @xmath69 .",
    "these quantities are physically consistent with each other ( i.e. , the iron line has the appropriate strength for that value of @xmath44 and @xmath50 ) when @xmath70@xmath71 ( corresponding to @xmath72@xmath73ev ) .",
    "this spectral modelling suggests that the accretion disk may be ionized .",
    "consequently , the k@xmath1 line need not be intrinsically narrow as we have assumed so far , but might be compton broadened in the hot skin of the accretion disk ( note that compton broadening alone can not explain the large line width ; reynolds & wilms , 2000 ) .",
    "we examine this possibility by relaxing our assumption of a narrow intrinsic line and , instead , model the _ intrinsic _ iron line with a gaussian profile of width @xmath74 .",
    "using the 1.511kev data , the best fitting value is @xmath75 ( with other parameters as above ) .",
    "even if we force the line to be very broad ( e.g. , @xmath761kev , at the expense of reducing the goodness of fit by @xmath77 ) , the data still require @xmath78 .    the second approach for handling the soft x - ray spectrum is to explicitly model the recombination k - lines of c , n , o and ne .",
    "qualitatively , this model is the same as the mixed emission - line model of branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with the presence of additional warm absorption .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81kev , @xmath82ev , @xmath83 and @xmath84ev ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "again , the relative reflection normalization is poorly constrained by these data , but self - consistency is achieved for @xmath86@xmath71 and @xmath87@xmath73ev .",
    "we conclude that the parameterization of the soft energy spectrum does not qualitatively change the results for the broadened fe k@xmath1 line .",
    "we note that the pexriv reflection model employed here is also incomplete due to the neglect of compton smearing of the absorption edges .",
    "we do not expect this to seriously comprise our results since the observed smearing is much greater than that expected from compton effects .",
    "however , we will examine these effects using improved models ( ballantyne , iwasawa & fabian 2001 ; nayakshin & kallman 2001 ) in a future publication .",
    "preliminary investigations show our current conclusions to be robust . finally , to check the dependence of these result on possible remaining calibration uncertainties we used the data from the mos-2 camera .",
    "the best fit parameters we find are consistent to within the error bars , with slight deviations at the si edge that are a known calibration issue .",
    "we conclude that our results are independent of any remaining calibration issues with the epic instruments .",
    "to summarize , our physically motivated best - fitting model consists of reflection from an ionized accretion disk that emits h - like iron k@xmath1 fluorescence with a relative reflection fraction of @xmath88@xmath71 and a broad iron line equivalent with of @xmath89@xmath73ev .",
    "the 210kev flux of @xmath90 is comparable with the `` deep minimum state '' found by iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 , @xmath91 ) . _",
    "the most interesting feature of these spectral models is that a very steep emissivity profile @xmath92@xmath93 for the iron - line / reflection features is required_. we address the implications of this result in the next section .",
    "finally , we note that if @xmath94 is allowed to vary , the data require @xmath95 in order to model the red - wing of the 38kev hump .",
    "we explicitly note that the data can not be adequately described by any reflection model with an inner radius of @xmath96 , the radius of marginal stability around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "thus , models in which the x - ray reflection occurs in the keplerian part of accretion disks around a non - rotating black hole can not explain these data . in principle , there can be x - ray reflection inside of the radius of marginal stability ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) .",
    "however , as discussed below , the extremely steep emissivity index @xmath34 required by our data is very hard to understand in the context of schwarzschild geometry .",
    "very steep emission profiles are required in all of our good fits to the fe k@xmath1 line and reflection continuum . here , we explore the implications of this result , assuming that the reflected flux ( including the iron line ) from a local patch of the disk is proportional to the x - ray continuum flux ( at the iron k - shell edge ) irradiating that patch .",
    "we will assume that a fixed fraction @xmath97 of the energy released locally in the body of the accretion disk is transported into an accretion disk corona and then radiated in the x - ray band .",
    "studies of such coronae suggest that @xmath98 in order to produce the observed continua ( haardt & maraschi 1993 , dove et al .",
    "thus , while our assumption may not be true in detail , it must be approximately true across a wide range of disk radii .",
    "can standard bh accretion disks models ( novikov & thorne 1973 , riffert & herold 1995 ) explain the observed emissivity profiles ? with the assumptions described above , this question reduces to an examination of the radial distribution of energy dissipation in such disk models . for a disk around an @xmath28 bh ,",
    "the flux emitted from the disk per unit proper area of the disk , @xmath99 , peaks at @xmath100 and then gradually steepens to approach @xmath101 . at no point",
    "does @xmath99 become as steep as @xmath102 , as required by our iron line observations .",
    "this is true for any assumed bh spin . also , as noted above , the emissivity profile is steeper than accretion disk models even if one accounts for intrinsic broadening of the iron line via comptonization .",
    "we note that there are two complications that may be relevant to real disks , even though they go beyond the realm of standard disk models .",
    "firstly , magnetic fields might couple material within @xmath103 to the rest of the disk , thereby permitting continued energy extraction from this material ( krolik 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 , hereafter ak00 ) .",
    "non - relativistic accretion disk simulations employing pseudo - newtonian potentials suggest that the stresses and presumably the dissipation remain fairly flat within this region ( hawley & krolik 2001 ; armitage , reynolds & chiang 2001 ) .",
    "hence , it would seem that the required emissivities are difficult to achieve through such effects for disks around schwarzschild holes .",
    "secondly , x - rays produced away from the equatorial plane might be gravitationally focussed into the central regions of the disk .",
    "however , using the method of petrucci & henri ( 1997 ) , we find that such effects can not produce the observed emissivity profile unless the x - ray source is already situated in the very central regions of the disk .",
    "we conclude that the disk has to be irradiated in a more centrally concentrated manner than predicted by current pure - accretion disk models . in other words , we require some additional x - ray source that is both powerful and very centrally concentrated .",
    "there is one obvious candidate : _ x - rays that are associated with the magnetic extraction of bh spin energy . _      here , we explore the suggestion that the central x - ray source is associated with the extraction of bh spin energy , focusing on scenarios in which the bh spin is extracted via magnetic fields that pierce the ( stretched ) event horizon @xcite .",
    "an alternative class of models in which the magnetic fields do not pierce the horizon will be addressed below . in order to produce the required steep irradiation profile ,",
    "the x - ray production must occur close to the disk itself with a production rate that is a steeply declining function of radius .",
    "thus , we are led to consider models in which the magnetic field lines connect the rotating event horizon to the accretion disk and/or disk corona . for definiteness",
    ", we will consider the canonical near - extremal kerr bh .    in models",
    "in which the magnetic field lines are strongly coupled to the body of the accretion disk , the magnetic field transmits a retarding couple to the bh if the bh rotates faster than the magnetically connected region of the disk where the extracted rotational energy will be deposited . in order to power the observed x - ray source",
    ", the field strength close to the bh needs to be @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "this is not an impossibly high field ; the corresponding magnetic pressure is still substantially below the ram pressure of the accretion flow within @xmath105 and so can be confined to the bh region .",
    "if a ring within the disk of width @xmath106 is connected to the event horizon with magnetic flux @xmath107 , then the power dumped into the ring is ( setting @xmath108 ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the angular velocity of the accretion disk , and the angular velocity of the event horizon is @xmath111 ( li 2000 ) .",
    "the bh resistance , @xmath112 , is a function of disk radius , @xmath113 , defined by a map from the bh horizon to the accretion disk along the magnetic field lines .",
    "viscous forces then transport this energy _",
    "outwards _ by some distance before it is dissipated and radiated .",
    "ak01 and li ( 2000 ) examine this process in detail and compute the radial dependence of the energy dissipation when the magnetic field connects to the accretion disk at one particular radius .",
    "we can use the formulae of ak01 ( also see li 2000 ) as the green s function for computing the more general case .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this letter to address the detailed distribution of the hole - threading magnetic field across the disk surface , @xmath114 , or the nature of @xmath115 .",
    "if all of the extracted spin energy is dumped into a ring at @xmath103 , the emissivity is very steep ( @xmath116 ) within @xmath117 and gradually flattens to @xmath118 at large radius @xcite .",
    "more generally , the spin energy will be deposited into a range of radii , flattening this profile .",
    "we will assume @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 corresponds to a dipole field for @xmath122 ) .",
    "for @xmath123 and @xmath121 , @xmath124 at @xmath125 and is flatter inside that radius . to produce emission profiles as extreme as those required by our data ( i.e. , @xmath126 at @xmath127 ) , field configurations as concentrated as @xmath1284 ( with some dependence on @xmath129 ) . such conditions could be achieved , for example , if the field were `` pinned '' onto the black hole by the ram pressure of the accretion flow .    we note that the models addressed by ak00 do not employ the blandford - znajek effect but , instead , magnetically torque the disk via coupling to _ matter _ deep within the plunging region .",
    "for parameters relevant to our discussion , the extra energy source is provided by the black hole spin via the penrose effect occuring within the radius of marginal stability ( but outside of the stretched horizon ) . in this case , all of the extra torque is provided at the inner edge of the disk ( rather than across a range of radii as addressed above ) and so a steep emissivity profile is a natural outcome .    finally , we note that the large self - consistent value of @xmath130 may have its origin in general relativity .",
    "some fraction @xmath131 of the upwardly directed disk emission will be bent by the strong gravity and strike the disk again , ( `` returning radiation '' , cunningham 1975 , speith , riffert & ruder 1995 , ak00 ) further enhancing @xmath69 .",
    "this can enhance the relative amount of reflection by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "further computations are required to assess the effect of returning radiation on the emissivity profile in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we have presented _ xmm - newton_-epic observations of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 containing a spectral feature that is best described as an extremely broad and redshifted x - ray reflection feature . both on the basis of the extreme spectrum and the source flux",
    ", it seems likely that we have caught mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 in the peculiar `` deep minumum '' state first noted by _ asca _",
    "( iwasawa et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the extreme nature of the line profile leads us to conclude that it originates from the centralmost parts of the accretion disk .",
    "standard accretion disk models can not produce an emissivity profile which is centrally concentrated enough to produce the observed feature .",
    "it also seems unlikely that gravitational focussing of the continuum x - rays or magnetic coupling of the plunging region to the rest of the disk can ameliorate this conclusion .",
    "therefore , we suggest that , during the deep minimum state , x - rays associated with the magnetic extraction of the spin energy of the black hole are dominating the emission , producing a sufficiently compact source to explain our observations . our results thus confirm the suggestion of iwasawa et al .",
