    "mumford conjecture claims that under the assumption of @xmath873 , a smooth projective curve of genus at least @xmath480 over @xmath615 embedded in its jacobian should have only finitely many torsion points of the jacobian .",
    "this was first proved by raynaud in @xcite in the following generalized form . here , we say that a closed subvariety @xmath33 of an abelian variety @xmath29 has _ dense torsion points _ if @xmath874 is dense in @xmath33 .",
    "further , raynaud proved in @xcite that the above statements holds for any dimensional @xmath33 .",
    "we should remark that moriwaki proved in @xcite that raynaud s theorem is a consequence of his theorem on the arithmetic bogomolov conjecture over a field finitely generated over @xmath0 .",
    "now consider what happens when @xmath875 . in this case , there exists an obvious counterexample : if @xmath615 is an algebraic closure of a finite field and @xmath33 is any closed subvariety of @xmath29 , then any @xmath615-point of @xmath33 is a torsion point , and thus @xmath33 always has dense torsion points .",
    "however , up to such influence of subvarieties which can be defined over finite fields , one may expect that a similar statement should also hold in positive characteristics .",
    "we have the following precise result :      [ thm : mm ] let @xmath29 be an abelian variety over @xmath615 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a closed subvariety of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath33 has dense torsion points , then there exist an abelian subvariety @xmath43 of @xmath29 , a closed subvariety @xmath41 of @xmath877 and a torsion point @xmath878 such that @xmath879 .",
    "this theorem is due to the following authors : in 2001 , scanlon gave a sketch of the model - theoretic proof of this theorem ( @xcite ) . in 2004 ,",
    "pink and roessler gave an algebro - geometric proof ( @xcite ) .",
    "in 2005 , scanlon gave a detailed model - theoretic proof in @xcite based on the argument in @xcite .",
    "note that in those papers , they prove a generalized version for semiabelian varieties @xmath29 , in fact .    here , we mention that theorem  [ thm : mm ] can be deduced from the geometric bogomolov conjecture for @xmath29 , as moriwaki did in the case of characteristic @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath29 be an abelian variety over @xmath615 and let @xmath33 be a closed subvariety of @xmath29 .",
    "then there exist @xmath880 such that @xmath29 and @xmath33 can be defined over @xmath881 , that is , there exist an abelian variety @xmath882 over @xmath4 and a closed subvariety @xmath883 of @xmath882 such that @xmath884 and @xmath885 .",
    "further , there exists a normal projective variety @xmath21 over @xmath5 with function field @xmath4 .",

    "then @xmath889 has dense torsion points and hence has dense small points .",
