    "turbulent electromagnetic fields can act as particle accelerators in astrophysical situations such as solar flares @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is governed by non - linear fluid equations , and the turbulent fields therefore deviate from a simple gaussian field @xcite , where the fourier phases are at random , and the field is completely specified by its two - point function . in real space ,",
    "the turbulent phase correlations manifest in coherent structures , with alignment of magnetic and velocity fields @xcite , and in non - gaussian higher - order correlations @xcite .",
    "the latter are not captured by traditional stochastic acceleration theory , which invokes the two - point functions of the magnetic field to predict the particle diffusion coefficients ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the numerical side ,",
    "some studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have worked with random - phase turbulence proxies and therefore neglected coherent structures , while others ( e.g. , @xcite ) used simulated mhd fields and took them into account .",
    "the presence of coherent structures may have conflicting effects on the acceleration efficiency @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", the coherent structures may act as traps and detain particles on their way to high energies . on the other hand",
    ", coherent structures may host large electric fields which help acceleration . which of the two effects prevails is hard to predict on theoretical grounds and depends on the topology and size of the coherent structures .",
    "a numerical exploration is thus needed to capture the whole diversity of possible orbit behaviour .",
    "the present article reports on relativistic test particle simulations in turbulent mhd electromagnetic fields , following a similar approach as @xcite . by applying an artificial phase randomization to the electromagnetic fields we then study the effect of coherent structures on test particle acceleration , and compare it with the gaussian field limit .",
    "the astrophysical realization envisaged by the present simulation is proton acceleration in solar flares , with emphasis on the high - energy regime where adiabaticity of the orbit breaks down .",
    "scaling to high - energy electrons or heavier ions is in principle possible , but not explicitly discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ field_sect ] describes the mhd fields and their randomization , and section [ orbit_sect ] describes the numerical generation of particle orbits and the physical approximations made in doing so .",
    "section [ result_sect ] presents the particle results , followed by a discussion of the acceleration mechanism ( sect .",
    "[ discussion_sect ] ) .",
    "section [ summary_sect ] contains a summary of the simulation results , and a discussion of their validity and implications .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the focus of this paper is on the role of turbulent coherent structures on particle acceleration .",
    "here we assume that particles are only subject to an electric field @xmath2 and a magnetic field @xmath3 through the ( relativistic ) lorentz force ( we will refer to a couple @xmath4 and @xmath3 as an `` accelerator '' ) . the electric field is taken according to mhd , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bulk velocity , @xmath7 is the electric current and @xmath8 is the magnetic diffusivity . in eq .",
    "( [ je ] ) and from now on we use alfvn units , i.e. , the magnetic field is scaled to the alfvn velocity , @xmath9 , and measured in the same units as the bulk velocity .",
    "another assumption of the present study is that the particles motion take place in a cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that at any instant the mhd fields can be viewed as superpositions of waves and decomposed in fourier modes : @xmath10 in the above expansions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are complex numbers which satisfy , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and can be written as , @xmath15 with real - valued @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . constructing a numerical field like ( [ ubf ] ) thus requires information both on the modulus and the phases of its fourier modes . in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the modulus of fourier modes are usually set to given values that depend only on the norm of the corresponding wave vector to mimic a given energy spectra .",
    "assigning appropriate phases to the fourier modes is a much more complex task . in a real turbulent field",
    ", these phases have to be correlated in such a way as to produce a field with subtle and intricate structures .",
    "prescribing them numerically represents the same complexity as prescribing the electromagnetic field at each point in space and is thus not practical .",
    "the most simple way of circumventing this problem is to assign random numbers in the interval @xmath20 $ ] to the phases and impose a given distribution , most often the uniform distribution to respect isotropy .",
    "the fields generated can then be qualified as stochastic but still have a prescribed energy spectra .",
    "more realistic phases can be obtained by generating the electromagnetic field through direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the mhd equations , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of the kinematic and magnetic pressures and @xmath23 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the magnetic field contains no mean contribution .",
    "since we assume incompressibility , @xmath22 is obtained by solving a poisson equation and is not an independent variable ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the initial condition used in ( [ nsu ] ) and ( [ nsb ] ) consists of fields with random phases , it is observed that after some time , the resulting electromagnetic field exhibits coherency that deviates strongly from its random phases counterpart ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the dns approach is very appealing , it should be stressed that it is very costly and that the values of reynolds numbers observed in typical turbulent systems are out of reach of present - day supercomputers . in that sense , the fields obtained through dns also constitute models for real - life turbulence .",
    "our objective is here to study two kinds of accelerators : a random phases one and a coherent one obtained through dns . to make things consistent , we construct both accelerators in such a way that they have",
    "exactly the same spectra and only differ through the value of the phases of their fourier modes . as a shorthand",
    ", the random phases accelerator will be denoted @xmath24 while the dns accelerator will be denoted @xmath25 . in the next section we detail the construction of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .      in order to obtain a suitable dns electromagnetic field",
    ", we solve equations ( [ nsu ] ) and ( [ nsb ] ) using a pseudo - spectral code in a cubic domain of side length @xmath26 and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our simulation code is dealiased and uses a 4th - order accurate runge - kutta time advancement scheme . as explained above , the initial condition for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are random phases fields of the form ( [ ubf ] ) whose spectra match the one observed in the comte - bellot - corrsin grid turbulence experiment at stage 2 @xcite ( this choice of spectra is motivated by the fact that the corresponding turbulence can be resolved with a resolution of @xmath29 fourier modes ) .",
    "the only extra requirement imposed on the fourier modes is incompressibility , @xmath30 = 0 . as time advances , the flow becomes  physical \" and we stop the simulation when the skewness of the velocity derivative @xmath31 reaches a quasi constant value @xcite .",
    "this criteria is standard and indicates that turbulence has had time to develop . here",
    ", the initialisation phase has taken about @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the alfvn time defined by @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the ( magnetic or velocity ) integral scale - length and @xmath36 ( from here on , angular brackets @xmath37 denote a spatial average ) .",
    "note that @xmath38 is determined by the ( rms ) magnetic fluctuations and not by a background magnetic field .",
    "some of the characteristics of the flow at 2.5@xmath33 are listed in table [ tableparamflow ] .",
    "there is approximate equipartition between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and both dissipate at the same rate ( magnetic prandtl number @xmath41 1 ) , so that the magnetic and velocity characteristic scales are similar .",
    "the reynolds number and magnetic reynolds number are about 300 . the magnetic field extracted from the dns at this final time and",
    "the electric field obtained through ( [ je ] ) constitute the accelerator @xmath25 .",
    ".turbulence characteristics of the velocity and magnetic fields used to construct @xmath25 . @xmath42 and @xmath43 designate the velocity and magnetic field spectra , e.g. , @xmath44 .",
    "angular brackets denote a spatial average . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     to construct @xmath24",
    "we modify the phases of @xmath12 and @xmath11 according to , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are random numbers distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath48 $ ] and which satisfy @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the electric field",
    "is then computed from eq .",
    "( [ je ] ) .",
    "the above transformation ensures that 1 ) the phases of the new fields @xmath24 contain a highly random part ; 2 ) the spectra of @xmath51 and @xmath52 remain unchanged ; 3 ) the divergence of @xmath3 remains equal to zero ; 4 ) the ideal mhd condition @xmath53 is preserved if @xmath54 , so that the randomization does not introduce parallel electric fields .",
    "the whole purpose of building an accelerator using dns of the mhd equations is to obtain an electromagnetic configuration that has more characteristic features of turbulence than only the correct energy spectra . in this section",
    "we describe some of the differences between @xmath25 and @xmath24 that are relevant from the point of view of turbulence and particle acceleration .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review on mhd turbulence .",
    "figure [ becube_fig ] presents 3d views of the magnetic ( @xmath39 ) and electric ( @xmath55 ) energy densities .",
    "although this corresponds only to a visual impression , it appears clear from the graphs that the electromagnetic field composing @xmath25 hosts more coherent , filamentary structures than the one composing @xmath24 . in the latter ,",
    "structures appear noisier and span regions of smaller extent .",
    "also , it appears from fig .",
    "[ becube_fig ] that the electric field has more extreme values ( dark red ) than the magnetic field , as already noticed by @xcite .",
    "more quantitative information on this can be obtained from the distributions ( one - point functions ) of individual field components . in the case of @xmath24",
    "it is observed , as expected , that @xmath56 and @xmath57 have a nearly gaussian distribution ( other components behave similarly ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath58 ( again for @xmath24 ) is very close to a zero - th order modified bessel function of the second kind , which decays exponentially for large values of its argument .",
    "this is again expected , since at high reynolds number @xmath58 is dominated by the term @xmath1 which behaves as the product of two gaussian variates for @xmath24 . in the case of @xmath25 , the distribution of the field components are similar to their random - phase equivalents . only for large values",
    "do they exhibit moderately pronounced tails resulting from higher intermittency .    a better measure of coherency",
    "is contained in the distributions of the longitudinal derivatives such as @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ( fig .",
    "[ histodbe_fig ] ) .",
    "again , the 2nd and 3rd components behave similarly and are therefore not shown . in the dns case , both @xmath59 and @xmath60 depart significantly from their random - phase equivalents . the distributions exhibit a large number of extreme values ( tails in the distribution ) .",
    "these events allow coherent structures to be present in the signal since they correspond to regions of space where sharp transitions  shaping \" the signal can occur .",
    "the strong differences in this diagnostic between the dns and random phases case reflect the marked visual differences observed in fig .",
    "[ becube_fig ] .",
    "the coherent structures also manifest in the longitudinal structure functions @xcite which are a natural extension of the longitudinal derivatives discussed above .",
    "the magnetic longitudinal structure functions are defined by @xmath61 \\cdot { \\bf \\hat{r}}|^p \\rangle$ ] and measure the variation of the @xmath22-th moment of the longitudinal magnetic field increment with distance @xmath62 ( hat denotes a unit vector ) .",
    "figure [ kurtosis_fig ] ( inlet ) shows the distribution of these increments along @xmath63 , averaged over @xmath64 = 1,2,3 . with increasing @xmath62 , the increments become decorrelated and their distribution becomes gaussian .",
    "the transition can be monitored by means of the kurtosis @xmath65 ; fig .",
    "[ kurtosis_fig ] ( diamonds ) shows the dns - to - sto kurtosis ratio as a function of @xmath62 . there is a clear systematic excess of the dns kurtosis at small @xmath62 , and one may infer from fig .",
    "[ kurtosis_fig ] that on scales @xmath66 , the dns and sto fields behave similarly . in particular , the dns field becomes independent at separations which are long compared to the integral length - scale of @xmath6 and @xmath3 ( tab .",
    "[ tableparamflow ] ) .",
    "another distinction between @xmath25 and @xmath24 , which will prove helpful in understanding the particle acceleration , is the relative orientation of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the nonlinear mhd equations ( [ nsb ] ) and ( [ nsu ] ) tend to align @xmath3 with @xmath7 in order to minimize the @xmath67 force",
    ". the ( approximate , @xmath68 = 283 ) frozen - in condition tends , then , to align @xmath3 with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this preference for alignment is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ buj_fig ] , showing the distribution of the orientation cosines @xmath69 and @xmath70 within the simulation cube",
    ". the dns distributions ( black line ) accumulate at the extreme values @xmath71 , corresponding to @xmath72 , more pronounced for @xmath70 than for @xmath69 .",
    "after the phase randomization is applied ( gray line ) , this accumulation vanishes and the distribution of @xmath70 ( botom panel ) become isotropic . the residual anti - correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( top panel , gray line ) , corresponding to a negative cross - helicity , is dominated by few small-@xmath75 modes , and is within statistical errors .",
    "note that for the mixed - field correlations , the coherent structures already manifest at the level of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , whereas one has to go to higher order moments if @xmath3 and @xmath6 are separately considered ( fig .",

    "an ensemble of collisionless charged particles is amenable to the mhd description if their orbits can be described by the drift velocity @xmath78 , where ` @xmath79 ' refers to the local magnetic field .",
    "the drift velocity then equals the mhd bulk velocity @xmath6 .",
    "this description requires that the larmor radius is much smaller than the radius of curvature of the magnetic field , and that @xmath80 is smaller than the alfvn velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the quiet solar corona",
    ", the ordering @xmath81 holds true for both electrons and ions . during solar flares ,",
    "when turbulence arises , a small fraction of the particles reaches relativistic energies , and it is this high - energy population which is treated here as test particles .",
    "the non - energetic bulk provides the mhd acceleration environment .",
    "the acceleration to relativistic energies is known to be rather rapid . in impulsive flares ,",
    "hard x ray signatures of relativistic electrons appear within fractions of a second , and gamma ray signatures of relativistic protons ",
    "if any  appear within a few seconds @xcite .",
    "the mhd structures , in contrast , evolve on a much longer time scale .",
    "the solar corona , in which acceleration is thought to occur , is a relatively collisionless environment .",
    "assuming a magnetic field strength of @xmath82 t , the electron and proton gyro times are in the order of nanoseconds and microseconds , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the ion - electron collision time is in the order of tens of milliseconds if we adopt a typical temperature @xmath83k and density @xmath84 m@xmath85 .",
    "the particles of the background plasma thus perform many gyrations before a coulomb collision is encountered , and this becomes even more true for high - energy test particles , because the collision rate rapidly decreases with energy ( @xcite ) . while the background plasma relaxes towards a maxwellian on time scales of tens of milliseconds , a relativistic test proton remains virtually collisionless .    for particles which move much faster than the background plasma ,",
    "the mhd fields may be regarded as static .",
    "this requires @xmath86 . in the solar corona",
    ", @xmath38 is in the order of 1000 km / s , and the condition @xmath86 is fulfilled for relativistic particles .",
    "however , acceleration begins at alfvnic velocities , and the question rises whether a static approximation applies from the very beginning .",
    "this depends on the time spent at low velocities . as outlined above , this time is observationally known to be short compared to the mhd time scale in the real solar corona , and in our orbit simulations we will find that particles reach relativistic velocities within some @xmath87 .",
    "the accelerated particles therefore spend most of the simulation in a state with @xmath86 , and we set @xmath88 throughout the whole orbit simulation . the stationarity assumption ( [ snapshot ] ) admits conservation laws which facilitate the numerical benchmarking and the physical understanding of the acceleration process . in this sense ,",
    "( [ snapshot ] ) also represents a simplifying working hypothesis .",

    "is measured in units of the ( dimensionless ) proper gyro time @xmath95 , corresponding to about @xmath96 s in real time .",
    "all test particles start out at random position and in random direction with initial velocity @xmath97 , representative of protons with @xmath98k .",
    "this ensures that the test protons can be considered as approximately collisionless , and that the initial larmor radius is smaller than the numerical cell .",
    "the orbits are exactly integrated , without recourse to gyrokinetic approximations .",
    "this approach benefits from simplicity and rigor , but allows only relatively small populations to be simulated over relatively short times .",
    "see section [ summary_sect ] for further discussion of the limitations of the method .",
    "equations ( [ dxdt ] ) and ( [ dpdt ] ) are integrated by a 4th order runge - kutta scheme with constant time step .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are taken from a snapshot of the pseudo - spectral mhd simulation , transformed to real space , and linearly interpolated to the actual particle positions .",
    "a parallel ( distributed memory ) implementation is used to enhance the computational power .",
    "the diagnostics includes energy histograms and the second moments of momentum and space displacements .    the static assumption ( eq . [ snapshot ] )",
    "implies that the vector potential evolves linearly with time , and that the scalar potential @xmath99 is independent of time .",
    "therefore the identity @xmath100 must hold , where @xmath101 is the solenoidal ( @xmath102 = 0 ) part of the electric field and @xmath103 is the initial energy . numerically , @xmath99 and @xmath101 are computed from the fourier amplitudes @xmath104 by decomposition into parallel and perpendicular components with respect to @xmath105 . to make the decomposition unique ,",
    "the potential is gauged such that @xmath106 .",
    "equation ( [ dh ] ) can be used to assess the numerical accuracy and to choose an appropriate time step . to this end , the right hand side of equation ( [ dh ] ) is numerically integrated along the trajectories and compared to the lefthand side ( fig .",
    "[ num_conserve_fig ] ) .",
    "the observed discrepancy @xmath107 depends on the time step @xmath108 and on the smoothness of the mhd fields ; both small @xmath108 and smooth fields help to fulfill equation ( [ dh ] ) . in view of the fact that real acceleration increases the particles kinetic energy by orders of magnitudes , an rms discrepancy of 1% on the 2@xmath109 level between the left- and righthand sides of equation ( [ dh ] ) at the end of the simulation",
    "is considered as acceptable .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath110 .",
    "the runge - kutta integration scheme was also tested against a simpler leapfrog scheme and it was shown that it provided a significant increase in precision .",
    "in this section we summarize the outcome of the particle simulations , focusing on the second moments and correlation functions of the dynamical quantities ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the average over particles will be denoted by @xmath112 in order to distinguish it from the spatial average @xmath37 .",
    "the particle ensembles comprise 50.000 particles .",
    "a first qualitative difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath24 cases concerns the intermittency of their real - space trajectories .",
    "figure [ traj3d ] shows sample orbits in @xmath25 ( left ) and @xmath24 ( right ) fields for times up to @xmath113 .",
    "as can be noticed , the @xmath25 orbits tend to have long sojourns between clusters where particles are temporarily trapped , and depart more from their origin than the @xmath24 trajectories .",
    "this tendency , observed for the few samples in figure [ traj3d ] , reflects in a full population average of the mean square displacement ( fig .",
    "[ delta_x_fig ] ) . here",
    "we see that the @xmath25 average grows somewhat faster than the @xmath24 average during the first 200 gyro times , from where on a relative excess of about 30% is preserved up to @xmath114 . during this time interval , the mean - square displacement grows approximately linearly with time ( dashed ) .",
    "later on , the @xmath24 curve overtakes the @xmath25 curve , and grows again faster than linearly with time .",
    "the bends observed in fig . [ delta_x_fig ] indicate changes of acceleration regimes which will be discussed below .",
    "the distance traveled by the test particles ultimately exceeds the side length of the mhd simulation cube , and the particles cross many periodic continuations of this cube .",
    "however , the particle orbits themselves are not periodic , because opposite points like @xmath115 and @xmath116 are not magnetically connected ( this is a consequence of the fully 3-dimensional nature of the mhd simulation ) , and because the particles may leave their magnetic field lines .",
    "rather , the particle orbits have mixing and ergodic properties .",
    "therefore , the periodicity of the mhd fields is not expected to affect the particle results .",
    "next we consider the diffusion in momentum space ( momentum @xmath117 is a better indicator for diffusion than the velocity because it is not limited by the speed of light ) .",
    "the evolution of the mean square momentum is shown in figure [ delta_p_fig ] for both @xmath25 and @xmath24 ensembles .",
    "the @xmath25 curve grows faster at @xmath118 , which is the typical particle crossing time of the coherent structures .",
    "later , when many coherent structures have been visited ( @xmath119 ) , the @xmath25 curve overtakes . the average terminal ( @xmath120 ) energy is @xmath121 for the @xmath122 case and @xmath123 for the sto case .",
    "thus our protons are accelerated to relativistic energies .",
    "the propagation of diffusion from momentum space ( where @xmath25 and @xmath24 act ) into real - space is governed by the mixed correlation @xmath124\\cdot \\bfv(t ) \\rrangle$ ] .",
    "this quantity is always positive due to the statistical preference for particles having traveled away from the origin to have a velocity component in the same direction .",
    "since the coherent structures are able to channel the particles along filaments , they impose a correlation between position and momentum , and we may expect @xmath125\\cdot \\bfp(t ) \\rrangle$ ] to grow faster in @xmath25 than in @xmath24 during the first structure - travel time .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ delta_xp_fig ] .",
    "the plateau at intermediate times @xmath126 indicates the regime of ordinary diffusion .      the evolution of the full energy distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ histoe_fig ] .",
    "the particles start out at @xmath127=0 with kinetic energy 0.0037@xmath128 , and spread then to higher values .",
    "note that for @xmath129 , the dns fields are more efficient accelerators than the sto fields , while the converse holds true at later times .",
    "the spectral shape has slightly positive ( negative ) curvature for @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) , indicating that the distribution functions decay sub - exponentially ( super - exponentially ) . when fitted by a power law @xmath132 in the sub - exponential range @xmath133 , power law indices @xmath134",
    "are found .",
    "similar exponents have been observed in medium - size solar flares , although for electrons , and smaller energies @xmath135 0.2 @xcite .",
    "the ultimate cause of particle acceleration is the electric field which is now examined in some detail , together with the microscopic nature of the particle orbits . from a particle dynamics point of view , the main classification of @xmath2 is into potential - solenoidal and parallel - perpendicular ( to @xmath3 ) components . from an mhd point of view",
    ", one may further distinguish between convective and dissipative fields .      by virtue of the ` snapshot ' condition ( eq . [ snapshot ] )",
    ", the potential part @xmath136 of the electric field does not contribute to acceleration on time scales which are long compared to the crossing time of local potential minima .",
    "however , the initially spatially uniform distribution of particles may become non - uniform at later times , resulting in a shift of the average kinetic energy which would manifest in figs .",
    "[ delta_p_fig ] and [ histoe_fig ] .",
    "this shift is bounded by the magnitude of the potential fluctuations @xmath137 , which is small compared to the energies reached in the tail of the energy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ histoe_fig ] ) .",
    "it is thus the solenoidal electric field @xmath101 which is responsible for acceleration . from an mhd point of view",
    ", @xmath101 is made up of the dissipative field @xmath138 plus parts of the convective field @xmath1 .",
    "numerically , the individual ( rms ) contributions are @xmath139 = 8.0 , @xmath140 = 9.35 , and @xmath141 = @xmath142 = 0.35 .",
    "thus the solenoidal electric field is somewhat weaker in the dns than in the sto case , in contrast to the enhanced dns acceleration efficiency at @xmath130 .      the picture ,",
    "though , changes if we distinguish between parallel and perpendicular components where @xmath143 . initially ( @xmath127 = 0 ) , the larmor radius is smaller than the size of the magnetic inhomogeneities , so that the particles are in a gyrokinetic regime .",
    "the ratio of the ( rms ) forces on the particles is @xmath144 , so that the particles , typically , exhibit a strong @xmath145 drift .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath146 thus approaches @xmath38 , and the maximal drift larmor radius @xmath147 exceeds its initial ( thermal ) value @xmath148 by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong turbulence assumption , where @xmath38 is given by the perturbations and not by a ( dominant ) background magnetic fields .",
    "although the particles gain substantial perpendicular momentum during the first half gyration , this is approximately restored in the second half , and so forth , so that there is little net gain from @xmath149 .",
    "the parallel field @xmath150 , however , yields direct parallel acceleration . as a consequence ,",
    "the velocity distribution becomes anisotropic ( fig .",
    "[ vparperp_fig ] ) , with a maximum anisotropy reached at @xmath151 . at later times , the velocities isotropize .",
    "one reason for this is the ( reversible ) conversion of parallel into perpendicular momentum at converging magnetic field lines .",
    "this mechanism is supported by the observation that @xmath152 is slightly ( @xmath153 ) enhanced during the isotropization phase @xmath154 , as would be expected when particles penetrate high-@xmath155 domains . a second cause of the isotropization observed in fig .",
    "[ vparperp_fig ] is the fact that the gyrokinetic approximation breaks down with increasing energy . in order to monitor the transition from gyrokinetic to eventually free orbits",
    "we compare the orbital radius of curvature @xmath156 to the characteristic scales of the magnetic field , where @xmath157 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath158 is shown in fig .",
    "[ rho_fig ] for a sample of 50 particles ( dots ) , with the average @xmath159 marked by solid line .",
    "initially , @xmath159 is smaller than the taylor microscale @xmath160 and also smaller than the numerical cell @xmath161 ( the electromagnetic fields are interpolated to the actual particle position ) .",
    "it then rapidly grows during @xmath162 , where it approaches the cell size and the growth slows down .",
    "the quantity @xmath163 defined in the foregoing paragraph is found equal to the maximum of @xmath158 during the first gyration within @xmath16410% .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ rho_fig ] and the criterion @xmath165 one may infer that , on average , the gyrokinetic regime is left after a few hundred gyro times . at this point the character of the orbit and the acceleration mechanism change .",
    "a picture thus arises where acceleration is initiated by the parallel component of the solenoidal electric field ( ` injection ' ) , and is then taken over by the full non - potential electric field . while the parallel component is somewhat larger in @xmath25 , the total solenoidal field is larger in @xmath24 .",
    "thus the dns fields are initially stronger accelerators , but the sto fields become more efficient at a later ( non - adiabatic ) stage . in both cases , the parallel electric field is entirely dissipative .",
    "the initial ( parallel ) acceleration phase corresponds to the first phase of fig .",
    "[ delta_x_fig ] ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the fact that the parallel field is weakened by the phase randomization , while the perpendicular electric field is strengthened , is easily understood from fig .",
    "[ buj_fig ] .",
    "the non - linear mhd alignment of @xmath3 with @xmath7 favours small @xmath167 ; this preference is lost in the phase randomization so that @xmath167 increases .",
    "similarly , the mhd alignment of @xmath6 and @xmath3 is lost in the phase randomization , and @xmath168 increases . since the convective field numerically dominates the dissipative one , the solenoidal electric field as a whole increases when the phase randomization is applied to @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "the crucial role of parallel electric fields can also be demonstrated by an alternative simulation setup , where @xmath2 is directly phase - randomized rather than computed from the phase - randomized @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "the ideal mhd condition @xmath53 is then broken even in the absence of resistivity , while the power spectral densities of @xmath3 and @xmath2 remain unchanged .",
    "we may thus ask what happens to the particles in such a directly phase - randomized electric field .",
    "this procedure has a certain interest on its own because of its implication on random - phase fokker - planck descriptions of stochastic acceleration .",
    "it turns out that the direct phase randomization of @xmath2 leads to a dramatic enhancement of acceleration .",
    "figure [ delta_p_escramble_fig ] shows the evolution of @xmath170 for the dns and directly phase - randomized cases .",
    "the curve corresponding to direct phase randomization of @xmath2 is labeled sto ( e ) .",
    "as can be seen , the dns and sto ( e ) curves separate after about half a gyro period , and the direct phase randomization of the electric field yields energies which are two orders of magnitude above the @xmath24 results .",
    "this dramatic enhancement of acceleration is entirely due to ( unphysical ) parallel electric fields .",
    "the local maximum of the dns curve at @xmath171 marks the first half gyro phase , where the velocities are , on average , reversed . at this point ,",
    "the particles in the directly phase - randomized electric field have already gained super - alfvnic velocities so that the effect of gyration is no longer visible .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of test particle acceleration in strong mhd turbulence ( @xmath172 ) and its phase - randomized version , with the electric field given by @xmath173 .",
    "it is found that the dynamical alignment of @xmath3 with @xmath7 and @xmath6 in true mhd affects the division of the electric field into parallel and perpendicular components , in the sense that parallel ( resistive ) components are favoured and perpendicular ( convective ) components are disfavoured . as a consequence , the true mhd turbulence provides more efficient direct acceleration of super - dreicer particles than its phase - randomized version . if the particles reach sufficiently high energies to leave the gyrokinetic regime , so that they can become accelerated by the solenoidal part of the @xmath174 force , the dynamical alignment of @xmath6 with @xmath3 yields weaker acceleration than predicted from the phase - randomized fields . for collisionless protons in mhd turbulence with magnetic reynolds number",
    "@xmath41 300 , this is the case for protons after a few 1000 gyro times .",
    "numerically , the acceleration efficiencies of the true mhd and phase - randomized fields differ by factors of order two .",
    "it is expected that the discrepancy would be larger for super - dreicer electrons , since these remain longer in the adiabatic regime where the enhancing effect of @xmath175 alignment is not yet competed with the diminishing effect of @xmath176 alignment .    with regard to solar flares envisaged as a astrophysical application ,",
    "a few words of caution are appropriate .",
    "the present simulation involves only dimensionless quantities such as @xmath177 or @xmath178 . in order to fix the absolute physical scaling , and since we were interested in the possibility of non - adiabatic acceleration , we have chosen protons as test particle . using typical values of the coronal magnetic field strength , and taking the resolution of the simulation into account ,",
    "the protons become non - adiabatic ( @xmath179 ) at @xmath180 , and reach energies as high as 10 gev ( 10 proton rest masses ) .",
    "such high energies are commonly not observed ; the highest energies from in - situ observations in the interplanetary space are about 100 mev / nucleon @xcite , and proton energies inferred from pion decay photons reach up to a few 100 mev / nucleon and occasionally up to a few gev @xcite .",
    "( only in the very largest flares such as of october 28 , 2003 , ground - based detections of relativistic protons and neutrons show energies up to 10 gev @xcite . ) also , the simulated acceleration is very rapid ; assuming @xmath181 , the simulation duration is only 0.1s in real time .",
    "there are two main reasons for the violent acceleration in the present simulation : the neglect of collisional and radiative losses , and the freedom in the absolute scaling of the simulation system .",
    "the latter is chosen such that one numerical cell is about 200 initial ( @xmath182 ) larmor radii ; this corresponds to @xmath183 100 m in real space .",
    "the resulting steep gradients  which are not detectable by present - day observations  , together with a larger - than - coronal resistivity ( @xmath184 300 ) , yield highly efficient accelerators , which allow us to rigorously follow the particles to relativistic energies before becoming swamped by accumulated numerical errors ( and running out of computing time ) .",
    "the simulation system is thus affected by computational considerations , and presumably over - estimates the absolute coronal acceleration rate .",
    "however , the relative influence of dynamical mhd alignment on particle acceleration should be correctly reproduced .",
    "another caveat stems from the test particle nature of the present simulation , which does not allow to address the question of absolute numbers of accelerated particles .",
    "the test particles are considered as resulting from a runaway process which is out of the scope of this simulation , so that we can not directly relate their number to the number of thermal background particles",
    ". however , it is clear that the test particles must not gain more energy than is available in the mhd fields .",
    "this sets an upper limit on their number , and also on the duration of the simulation .",
    "( as the simulation does not include loss processes , the test particles can gain arbitrary large energy . ) in our simulations , the test protons pick up alfvnic velocities within one gyration .",
    "this brings them to kinetic energies of the ambient ( low - beta ) coronal plasma , which is assumed to be in equipartition , @xmath185 .",
    "in the course of the simulation , the kinetic energy of the test particles increases by a factor @xmath186 .",
    "this should not exceed a small fraction ( say , @xmath187 ) of the magnetic field energy , such as not to perturb the mhd configuration .",
    "therefore the test particles represent a fraction @xmath188 of all particles only .",
    "this fraction is small , but not unreasonably small for runaway protons , which must be substantially faster than the electrons in order for runaway to occur @xcite .",
    "it is also in agreement withe the observation that most solar flares do not show signature of high - energy protons ( but only of high - energy electrons ) .",
    "however , if the test particles are to represent more than @xmath189 of all particles , then the acceleration should be stopped at earlier times . since it is found that the test particle energy increases roughly linearly with time , the maximum simulation duration is @xmath190 .",
    "in fact , it might happen that the mhd description brakes down after a few 100 gyro times , so that the non - adiabatic regime where the @xmath24 fields become more efficient accelerators is never reached .",
    "returning to the more technical aspects , and motivated by the findings of sect .",
    "[ direct_e_sect ] , we would like to stress that violation of the ideal mhd condition @xmath191 by random - phase approximations unavoidably leads to artificial particle acceleration .",
    "if , in theory or numerics , a turbulence proxy is generated by superimposing alfvn modes @xmath192 with @xmath193 , then a parallel electric field occurs which is of second order in @xmath194 .",
    "for example , if the @xmath195 are random isotropic in the plane perpendicular to @xmath196 , with orientation uncorrelated to @xmath197 , then @xmath198 ; for @xmath199 , the parallel electric field has thus standard deviation @xmath200 .",
    "although this is small compared to the perpendicular electric field ( @xmath201 ) , it may give rise to secular growth of the parallel particle momentum .",
    "therefore , stochastic acceleration in turbulence proxies constructed from superimposed alfvn waves might in fact over - estimate the acceleration in true mhd turbulence .    finally , we point out that , although the coherent structures do not manifest in the two - point functions ( or power spectral densities ) of @xmath3 and @xmath2 alone , they contribute to their mixed correlations . this fact can , in principle , be taken into account in langevin- or fokker - planck formulations of stochastic acceleration ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which deal with the transfer of spatial correlators of the electromagnetic fields into the particle diffusion coefficients . given the correlations @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 , one may compute , for example , the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath205 along the drifting gyrocentre @xmath206 ( sect .",
    "[ parperp_sect ] ) , where @xmath207 for strong turbulence . the quantity @xmath208 may then be evaluated numerically , as follows .",
    "first we choose a large ( @xmath209 ) number of random initial data ( @xmath210 ) with uniform position @xmath211 and isotropic velocity of fixed modulus @xmath212 , like for the simulated test particles .",
    "then , for each ( @xmath210 ) the instantaneous ( straight ) gyrocentre orbit @xmath213 is computed , and the electromagnetic force @xmath214 is probed along this orbit .",
    "the average of @xmath215 over all particles ( initial data ) is performed , and the integral in the definition of @xmath208 is approximated by a sum of sufficiently resolved increments . proceeding this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath208 = 0.03 for @xmath25 and @xmath208 = 0.018 for @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio of these values reflects the excess of @xmath216 over @xmath217 observed in fig .",
    "[ delta_p_fig ] for @xmath218 . a detailed study of the modification of @xmath208 by the cross - correlation @xmath203 has , to the authors knowledge , not yet been carried out .",
