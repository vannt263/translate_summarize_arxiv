    "this relaxation in regularity might seem mild , but it is crucial in applications to nonuniformly hyperbolic flows with singularities .",

    "most notably , there exist @xmath87-invariant stable and unstable cone fields that are defined _ everywhere _ in @xmath6 .",
    "the angle between these cone fields tends to zero as the basepoint in @xmath6 approaches the singularity .",
    "the action of @xmath87 in these cones is strongly hyperbolic , with the strength of the hyperbolicity approaching infinity as the orbit comes close to the singularity .",
    "the key observation in this paper is that by changing the riemannian metric on @xmath6 _ and _ performing a natural time change in @xmath7 one obtains a volume - preserving _ anosov _ flow on a _ complete _ riemannian manifold of finite volume .",
    "this time change does not change orbits and has a predictable effect on stable and unstable bundles .",
    "one can apply all of the known machinery for anosov flows to this rescaled flow , and transferring the information back to the original flow , one concludes that @xmath7 possesses invariant stable and unstable foliations @xmath86 and @xmath84 that are locally uniformly @xmath82 .",
    "this gives the crucial input in constructing the section @xmath83 and return function @xmath13 defined above .    in the setting of weil - petersson geometry",
    ", one can summarize the results of this time change : in the exceptional case @xmath88 , the weil - petersson geodesic flow , when run at unit speed _ in the teichmller metric _ is ( like the teichmller flow ) an anosov flow . for @xmath89 ,",
    "the wp flow is not anosov , even when viewed in the teichmller metric ( or an equivalent riemannian metric such as in @xcite ) , but it might be fruitful to study the flow from this perspective .",
    "we remark here that hamenstdt @xcite has recently constructed measurable orbit equivalences between the wp and teichmller geodesic flows for all @xmath90 .",
    "a different approach , using anisotropic function spaces , has been employed by liverani to establish exponential mixing for contact anosov flows in arbitrary dimension , even when the foliations @xmath86 and @xmath84 fail to be @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this method is more holistic ( though no less technical ) as the arguments take place in the manifold itself ( not a section ) and avoid symbolic dynamics",
    ". it would be interesting to attempt to import this machinery to the present context .",

    "the map @xmath1446 is just the composition @xmath1450 of this flow with the center - stable projection @xmath1451 , defined in the beginning of the section .",
    "this latter projection is a uniformly @xmath82 submersion and a local diffeomorphism when restricted to local unstable manifolds , since the foliation @xmath1085 is uniformly @xmath82 .",

    ", we obtain that there exists a uniform constant @xmath974 such that @xmath1468 , for all @xmath1110 .",
    "this gives conclusion ( 6 ) .",
    "since the function @xmath12 is bounded , lemma  [ l = r_0bound ] implies that for each @xmath58 , we have @xmath1469 since @xmath1470 , this gives conclusion ( 7 ) of theorem  [ t = tower ] , where @xmath413 is chosen so that @xmath1471 .    finally we verify that the uni condition in conclusion ( 8) holds",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath7 preserves a contact @xmath792-form @xmath934 , which implies that the foliations @xmath84 and @xmath86 are not jointly integrable .",
