    "the aharonov - bohm problem @xcite certainly leads to one of the most fascinating quantum mechanical effects which has been experimentally tested @xcite .",
    "clearly the original model as stated in the seminal 1959 paper @xcite is by itself somehow an abstraction .",
    "leaving aside the zero flux size limit issue and the related question of the behaviour of wave functions at the location of the vortex ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) there is not such a physical system where the flux of a magnetic field can pierce a plane at a certain location without returning at some other place on the plane so that the total flux is zero . in the aharonov - bohm paper",
    "this issue is solved by assuming that the return flux is spread far away on the plane ( in fact at infinity ) so that its direct effect on the problem at hand can be neglected .",
    "this simplifying assumption is crucial in rendering the model exactly solvable , and most of the research effort has been devoted to this situation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we would like to address here a more realistic situation where the piercing flux returns at a finite distance .",
    "more precisely , we consider two vortices of opposite strength piercing the plane at distance @xmath1 one from the other .",
    "doing so , we move from the solvable one - vortex standard aharonov - bohm problem to a two - vortex problem , which is more difficult to address , with no explicit solution at disposal .",
    "a few many - vortex aharonov - bohm problems have already been considered in the literature , in particular the scattering on vortices arranged on a lattice @xcite or vortices whose locations are random @xcite .",
    "the problem of scattering of an incident plane wave on several vortices has mostly been discussed by two methods . in @xcite@xcite",
    "a formal expansion of the scattering amplitude in a series of mathieu functions has been constructed and in @xcite@xcite a formal diagrammatic - like series has been proposed .",
    "so far these approaches have had a limited success and did not produce explicit formulas except when the distance between the vortices goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "here we consider the scattering problem on two vortices in the singular gauge with non - trivial boundary conditions along a cut connecting the vortices . to address this problem",
    ", we use an approach already put forward in @xcite for studying the low - energy spectrum of a charged particle in an harmonic well coupled to two aharonov - bohm fluxes of different strength . in the plane a discontinuity has to materialize on any branch cut joining the two vortices due to the non - trivial aharonov - bohm phases accumulated by the charged particle moving around one or the other vortex . the positions of the vortices are fixed at @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the @xmath4-axis , so that the branch cut can be chosen to be the half - circle of radius @xmath2 centered at the origin in the lower half - plane ( of course the observables , here the modulus squared of the scattering amplitude , should not depend on the choice of a branch cut ) . as here the total flux is zero , no phase is accumulated at infinity by the particle encircling both vortices . the scattering amplitude is , by definition , a series of scattering amplitudes between incoming and outgoing hankel partial waves . the non - trivial boundary conditions on the cut lead to an infinite system of equations for the expansion coefficients , which are solved numerically .",
    "the main part of the paper is devoted to an analytic investigation of two limiting cases .",
    "the first is the small flux limit ( more precisely , the small @xmath5 limit , where @xmath5 is the dimensionless ratio of the flux to the quantum of flux ) and the second is the small @xmath2 limit ( in fact the small @xmath6 limit , where @xmath7 is the scattering momentum ) . in both cases",
    "the analytic expressions obtained are in good agreement with the numerical calculations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "we start in section  [ equations ] by developing the formalism for the scattering of an incident plane wave making an angle @xmath8 with the @xmath4-axis .",
    "we illustrate in section  [ nume ] the physics at hand with several numerical simulations in various cases of interest .",
    "next , in section  [ small_alpha ] we consider the small @xmath5 limit and find an exact lowest - order expression for the scattering amplitude . in section  [ small_kr_case ]",
    "we consider the small @xmath6 limit , which allows for some simplifications in the contribution of the relevant partial wave scattering amplitudes .",
    "then in section  [ exact_solution ] we transform the small @xmath6 equations into a form which lets us find an exact expression for the scattering amplitude by the riemann - hilbert method . in section  [ approach ] we show how the same solution can be obtained and simplified by applying the riemann - hilbert method directly to the problem . in section  [ conclusion ] we outline the main results . a few details of the calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "we consider two aharonov - bohm vortices on a plane at points @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. , with polar coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 with fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath13 respectively ( see figure  [ fig_cut ] ) .",
    "we work in the singular gauge , where the electromagnetic potential is removed but the wave function is defined with a cut connecting the two vortices such that on the opposite branches of the cut the wave function and its normal derivative obey the relations     and @xmath13 . ]    @xmath14    and @xmath15 here and below superscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 indicate functions outside and inside the circle , respectively , and @xmath18 describes the necessary jump along the cut . in the geometry of figure  [ fig_cut ]",
    "it can be written in various equivalent forms @xmath19 where @xmath20 $ ] denotes the angular interval of the cut .    everywhere except the cut the wave function obeys a free schrdinger equation @xmath21 inside the cut circle the wave function",
    "can be expanded into series of regular elementary solutions of ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "we find it convenient to use the bessel function basis @xmath22 let us denote the wave function outside the circle by @xmath23 .",
    "to implement the boundary conditions ( [ ab_function ] ) and ( [ ab_derivative ] ) , one multiplies both equations by @xmath24 and integrates over @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 for all integer @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "one concludes that @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the usual way to exploit these conditions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is to expand @xmath33 into a series of hankel functions provided that the incident wave is fixed : @xmath34 from ( [ eqs ] ) it follows that the coefficients @xmath35 obey an infinite system of equations @xmath36 where the @xmath37 s are the fourier coefficients of @xmath18 in ( [ phi ] ) @xmath38 here and below , when the argument of bessel functions is not specified , it is meant to be equal to @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the @xmath35 s as @xmath40 so that the @xmath41 s obey the system of equations @xmath42    from figure  [ fig_cut ] it is clear that the scattering problem is symmetric with respect to a reflection in the @xmath43-axis .",
    "namely , if @xmath44 is a solution then @xmath45 is also a solution .",
    "this symmetry is a consequence of the invariance of the function @xmath18 under the transformation @xmath46 it manifests itself in a symmetry of the matrix elements @xmath37 @xmath47 and of the expansion coefficients @xmath41 @xmath48 the matrix @xmath37 has two more symmetries . a trivial one corresponds to an integer shift @xmath49 , which leaves @xmath37 and @xmath41 invariant : @xmath50 this invariance reflects the well known fact that the aharonov - bohm effect depends only on the fractional part of @xmath5 .",
    "the second symmetry is related with the transformation @xmath51 . from ( [ a_mn ] )",
    "one concludes that @xmath52 which leads to the symmetry for the coefficients @xmath41 @xmath53 the knowledge of coefficients @xmath35 ( or @xmath41 ) determines all other quantities .",
    "of particular interest is the amplitude of scattering of a plane wave on the two vortices . to determine it",
    ", one has to find a solution which at large distances from the vortices is the superposition of an incoming plane wave in the direction @xmath8 and a circular symmetric outgoing wave @xmath54 expanding the incoming plane wave into a series of bessel functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath55 the scattering wave function can be expressed through @xmath56 defined in ( [ elementary ] ) as @xmath57 @xmath58 is the reflected field given by a series of hankel functions of the first kind @xmath59 from the asymptotic behaviour of the hankel functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath60 one gets that the scattering amplitude @xmath61 in ( [ asymptotic ] ) is @xmath62 the symmetries ( [ zero_symmetry ] ) and ( [ second_symmetry ] ) lead to the symmetries of the scattering amplitude @xmath63 and @xmath64 these relations make it possible to restrict the value of flux to @xmath65 .",
    "we proceed to calculate the scattering amplitude numerically , by solving the systems ( [ rescaled ] ) for @xmath41 , for different values of @xmath66 , and substituting the result into ( [ definition ] ) and then ( [ amplitude ] ) . from physical considerations",
    "it follows that contributions of partial waves with @xmath67 have to be small . in the calculations below we",
    "restrict ourselves to @xmath68 and check that higher waves do not change the results noticeably .",
    "truncation in @xmath69 is more complicated . in order to find the coefficients themselves with good precision",
    ", one has to retain much higher values of @xmath69 in the systems ( [ rescaled ] ) , @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "even then , the precision attained at technically feasible values of @xmath72 is not sufficient , and one has to extrapolate the results to @xmath73 .    for a given finite @xmath72 , we truncate the infinite sum in ( [ rescaled ] ) to @xmath74 , so that the system , for a given @xmath66 , consists of @xmath75 equations for as many variables .",
    "it turns out that convergence in @xmath72 is improved by employing the technique used in @xcite , discretizing the boundary conditions .",
    "the issue at hand is that by choosing @xmath75 coefficients @xmath35 in ( [ elementary ] ) and , respectively , @xmath75 coefficients @xmath76 in ( [ besselbasis ] ) , one can , in general , satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ ab_function])([ab_derivative ] ) exactly for no more than @xmath75 discrete values of @xmath25 , rather than for any @xmath25 .",
    "a convenient recourse is to enforce those conditions at @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( these @xmath75 points are distributed uniformly on the circle and avoid as much as possible the locations of the fluxes , where the wave function is singular ) .",
    "then , integration over @xmath25 in ( [ eqs ] ) has to be replaced with summation over @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to see that the only change this entails is a modified expression for @xmath37 , namely @xmath80 for @xmath73 , one recovers ( [ a_mn ] ) , whereas for a given finite @xmath72 , the resulting amplitude is closer to the infinite-@xmath72 one than the one obtained without this modification .",
    "convergence in @xmath72 of the resulting scattering amplitude is slow , due to the usual problem inherent in aharonov - bohm or anyon numerics : we are trying to represent a wave function which has a fractional power behaviour at the positions of the vortices ( cf .",
    "( [ singular_limits ] ) ) , as an expansion in terms of regular wave functions .",
    "the corresponding coefficients fall off slowly .",
    "we have found , however , that for all values of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 considered , and for any @xmath81 $ ] , the @xmath72 dependence of the amplitude fits an empirical formula @xmath82 well , even for rather small @xmath72 .",
    "( we have used the values @xmath83 for the fitting . )    in figures  [ fig_theta_0]-[fig_theta_pi_2 ] we present the results of numerical calculations for the amplitude of the scattering on two aharonov - bohm vortices for fluxes @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 with @xmath87 and with incident angles @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 . for clarity , in these figures",
    "we count the reflection angle from the direction of the incident wave , i.e. , we plot @xmath91 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "a notable feature of the results is the absence of symmetry with respect to the reflection @xmath92 .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard aharonov - bohm scattering , where , despite the fact that chiral symmetry is broken by the presence of the vortex , the amplitude remains symmetric under such reflection .",
    "one could have expected the same here for @xmath93 , when the geometry of the system is just as symmetric with respect to the oncoming wave as it is with a single vortex .",
    "however , in general this turns out not to be the case because for the invariance the spacial reflection has to be accompanied by interchanging of the vortices . for @xmath88",
    "only the case @xmath94 is symmetric with respect to inversion @xmath95 ( cf .",

    "( [ sym_1 ] ) ) .",
    "to find the leading term of the scattering amplitude in the limit @xmath97 , it is convenient first to transform the boundary conditions to another form which is of independent interest .",

    "fortunately , the analytical formula ( [ small ] ) for the dominant contribution at small @xmath5 ( [ small ] ) is regular and does not contain singularities at the vortex positions .",
    "this means that the coefficient in front of @xmath114 is , at least , of the second order in @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at very small @xmath5 we drop that term from the fit ( [ general_fit ] ) .",
    "the results obtained in this manner are presented in figure  [ fig_1 ] for different incident angles and compared with ( [ small ] ) for small @xmath5 . for clarity , we divide the scattering amplitude by @xmath110 and , like in the previous section , count the reflection angle from the direction of the incident wave .",
    "the agreement is quite good and the differences between both curves are of the order of the terms which have been neglected ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) .",
    "another interesting limit corresponds to the vortices close to each other , so that @xmath115 . in this case it is convenient to use the rescaled variables ( [ rescaled ] ) and to expand all quantities at small @xmath4 .",

    "it follows that when @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "therefore at small @xmath4 the dominant contribution to the scattering amplitude comes from the @xmath0-wave amplitude ( @xmath123 ) , more precisely from @xmath124 , as it is usual for the scattering on small - size objects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , to determine @xmath124 , one still has to solve an infinite system of equations ( [ limit_system ] ) with @xmath123 : @xmath125 the scattering amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) is dominated at small @xmath4 by @xmath124 @xmath126 where we used that , at small @xmath4 , @xmath127 with @xmath120 given by ( [ rho ] ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    from ( [ zero_symmetry ] )",

    "we use only one of the two aharonov - bohm boundary conditions ( [ inside_outside ] ) , which matches the function on the cut circle , but do not discuss explicitly the second condition ( [ ab_derivative ] ) , which matches the derivative .",

    "but for any such function the derivatives with respect to @xmath279 and @xmath25 are proportional to each other : @xmath280 therefore , when condition ( [ inside_outside ] ) is satisfied and the function @xmath18 is piecewise constant ( like in our case ) the derivative with respect to @xmath279 will obey the same condition as the function itself , except for @xmath281-function contributions at the points of discontinuities of @xmath18 .",
    "one can check that ( [ first ] ) is related with the cancellation of these discontinuities . as has been demonstrated in the previous section , that equation leads to the vanishing of the wave function at singular points ( cf .",

    "it was argued that a solution of the @xmath0-wave type which remains finite at the two vortex locations can not exist . but",
    "a logarithmic term like the one in ( [ main_expansion ] ) was not properly taken into account in that discussion . when ignored ( which means setting @xmath282 in ( [ exact_s_wave ] ) ) , only the singular solution @xmath209 is obtained .",

    "first , we developed a numerical method for the construction of scattering amplitude . in its simplest formulation it reduces to solving an infinite system of equations  ( [ rescaled ] ) .",
    "the convergence of finite approximants is slow due to the singular behaviour of the wave function at the vortex positions ( cf .",
    "( [ singular_limits ] ) ) .",

    "i.e. , when @xmath283 , the scattering amplitude takes the form @xmath284 where @xmath8 and @xmath285 are respectively the incident and reflection angles .    in the small @xmath6 limit",
