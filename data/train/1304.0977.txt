    "the damped harmonic oscillator has a central place in physics , due to the prevalance of dissipation and linear response in our description of the physical world . yet",
    "while the classical treatment of the damped oscillator is elementary and well understood , the opposite is true in quantum physics .",
    "the dissipation of energy leads to difficulties in applying the standard quantization rules to the damped oscillator  @xcite .",
    "moreover , current experimental work is probing the degree to which quantum mechanics may describe the macroscopic world  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the regime is often one where linear response is applicable and the degree of dissipation is of interest .",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent existing approaches to quantum damped systems accurately describe the results  @xcite . here",
    "we explore the consequences of a recent , and particularly general treatment of the damped harmonic oscillator  @xcite , where a measured value of the dissipative response of the system as a function of frequency may be input as a parameter directly into the hamiltonian , something which is not possible in previous approaches .",
    "the thought is that , in analogy to electromagnetism , where the susceptibilities of a medium are routinely measured and then used as parameters within the quantum theory  @xcite , one might extend this approach to describe the aforementioned experiments . through choosing a model susceptibility where the system is exactly solvable",
    ", we find the interesting result that the ground state energy of a damped oscillator  as calculated using the hamiltonian of mean force  decreases as the damping is increased , and propose a means whereby this phenomenon might be measured .",
    "the technical difficulties in the canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator can be overcome through the inclusion of reservoir degrees of freedom that take up the dissipated energy .",
    "if the reservoir has a finite , or countably infinite , number of degrees of freedom , then a delicate limiting procedure must be employed to try to capture genuine damping behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this limiting procedure is not usually performed in detail , but the subtleties involved are lucidly demonstrated by tatarskii  @xcite . the limiting procedure amounts to a transition from a finite to an uncountably infinite number of dynamical degrees of freedom in the reservoir .",
    "the fact that this limit is imposed after the field equations have already been solved under the assumption of a _ finite _ reservoir obscures any connection with the original hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , it has been shown  @xcite that the limiting procedure must be separately constructed for each specific damping behaviour if it is to be rigorously performed , something that is generally dispensed with in practice .",
    "rather than follow this well - trodden path , here we apply the technique used to quantize electromagnetism in absorbing media  @xcite , where a reservoir with an uncountably infinite number of degrees of freedom is used from the outset .",
    "this method was extended to the damped oscillator in  @xcite and has the advantage that the imaginary part of the susceptibility that governs the dynamics of the oscillator appears explicitly as a parameter in the lagrangian or hamiltonian .",
    "there is no limiting procedure to be performed and moreover the quantum dynamics of the damped oscillator is then placed on the same footing as macroscopic quantum electrodynamics . in what follows we use this approach to explore the behaviour of the thermal and zero - point energy of the quantum damped oscillator .",
    "we apply the previously derived results  @xcite for a general damped oscillator in thermal equilibrium to a simple model susceptibility that allows exact analytic solution for all quantities of interest .",
    "this example is used as a guide to the type of effects that may be measurable with current macroscopic quantum oscillators .",
    "we find that the zero - point energy of the oscillator is less than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the free oscillation frequency in the absence of damping .",
    "the energy removed in cooling the oscillator from temperature @xmath2 to its quantum ground state is found to increase with damping , which offers one possibility of experimentally demonstrating the effect derived here .",
    "it is also plausible that the damping might be engineered , as we discuss below .",
    "the form of the lagrangian for a single damped degree of freedom , @xmath3 ( unit mass and free oscillation frequency @xmath4 ) was previously given as  @xcite @xmath5 where the @xmath6 constitute the reservoir and are labelled by a continuum ` index ' @xmath7 . the coupling function @xmath8 between reservoir and oscillator",
    "is related to the imaginary part of the susceptibility by @xmath9}{\\pi}},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the linear susceptibility that quantifies the effect of the environment on the motion of the oscillator ( the factor of @xmath4 in @xmath8 is present so that the susceptibility is dimensionless ) .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath10 obeys the kramer - kronig relations  @xcite , so the imaginary part of @xmath10 that appears in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) determines the real part .",
    "in fact the kramers - kronig relations give the full susceptibility in terms of the coupling function @xmath8 as  @xcite @xmath11 the resulting theory is more transparent than caldeira  leggett type approaches , in that the reservoir stipulated in the lagrangian is sufficient for the task and does not have to be modified later .",
    "in fact , the approach in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is essentially identical to that used in quantum electromagnetism within an arbitrary absorbing dielectric medium , which can of course be viewed as a field theory of damped oscillators .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of a general damped harmonic oscillator is governed by an arbitrary susceptibility that obeys the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite , just as for the dynamics of light in a material medium .",
    "our point of view is that canonical quantization of macroscopic electromagnetism for arbitrary dielectrics  @xcite and canonical quantization of a general damped harmonic oscillator  @xcite are both most effectively carried out using the powerful reservoir formalism originally introduced by huttner and barnett  @xcite .    from ( [ lagrangian ] )",
    "we can derive a hamiltonian and apply the standard quantization rules .",

    "dissipation theorem , but must be obtained from the total thermal energy of the coupled oscillator / reservoir system . this was calculated in  @xcite by subtracting , from the total thermal energy , the thermal energy of the reservoir in the absence of any coupling to the oscillator , giving the result @xmath18g(\\omega)\\right\\}. \\label{hq}\\ ] ] a similar procedure in the electromagnetic case gives the casimir ( zero - point plus thermal ) stress - energy of the electromagnetic field in a material  @xcite .",
    "in the appendix we show that the prescription giving ( [ hq ] ) is equivalent to the thermal average of the hamiltonian of mean force  @xcite , consistent with earlier work on the thermodynamics of strongly coupled systems  @xcite . in light of this ,",
    "the results of  @xcite show that the casimir energy density is the thermal average of the hamiltonian of mean force for the electromagnetic field in a macroscopic medium , a connection that was not recognised in  @xcite and which does not appear to be widely appreciated .    in accordance with our viewpoint that damping ought to be generally treated in the same way as electromagnetic dissipation , the susceptibility @xmath10 of a real damped oscillator should be measured rather than postulated .",
    "recall that the electromagnetic susceptibility of an individual material sample must be measured , and will vary even for samples of the same material .",
    "the position and momentum correlation functions  @xcite of the damped oscillator in thermal equilibrium provide one method of experimentally extracting the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath1 that appear in ( [ gchi ] ) .    in the absence of tabulated values , it is instructive to consider simple formulae for the susceptibility of a damped oscillator . in  @xcite the example of damping proportional to velocity",
    "was treated in detail , but this gives some problems with the zero - damping limit at @xmath2 if the corresponding susceptibility @xmath10 is taken to hold strictly at all frequencies up to infinity .",
    "in addition , the case of damping proportional to velocity would not be expected to be experimentally relevant  @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider another example , chosen to be simple enough to allow exact analytical solution while being well - behaved in the limit of zero damping of the oscillator .",

    "being analytic in the upper - half complex - frequency plane , the real and imaginary parts of ( [ chi ] ) exhibit kramer - kronig relations and from ( [ algen ] ) and ( [ chireim ] ) we find that the coupling function @xmath8 in ( [ lagrangian ] ) corresponding to the susceptibility ( [ chi ] ) is @xmath22}}.\\ ] ] it is important to note that the thermal results ( [ qqtime ] ) , ( [ pqpqtime ] ) and ( [ hq ] ) are only valid for cases where the total hamiltonian can be diagonalized into normal modes , which is not always possible  @xcite . a sufficient condition for the hamiltonian to be diagonalizable",
    "was found in  @xcite to be @xmath23 a restriction that would not be transparent from the fluctuation  dissipation theorem . for the coupling function ( [ al ] ) ,",
    "the condition ( [ ineqgen ] ) yields @xmath24 which we assume to hold throughout . when @xmath25 , @xmath20 remaining fixed , the susceptibility ( [ chi ] ) vanishes and the case of an undamped oscillator is recovered .    the green function ( [ gchi ] ) for the susceptibility ( [ chi ] ) has poles @xmath26 which correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the oscillator coupled to the reservoir .",
    "the constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 thus serve as damping constants of the oscillator , while @xmath27 is a modified oscillation frequency when it is real .",
    "note that ( [ ineq ] ) implies that the poles ( [ gpoles ] ) are all in the lower - half complex - frequency plane so the green function has retarded boundary conditions .",
