    "<S> the incident wave is @xmath14-polarized , i.e. the electric field is in the @xmath52 plane ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered wave is detected in @xmath3 polarization , i.e. the electric field is parallel to the @xmath53 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified numerically , that @xmath54 and @xmath55 inside the wire regions , i.e. the ( linear ) mixing between @xmath3 and @xmath14 polarizations inside the wires is negligible . </S>",

    "<S> the asymmetry between stokes and anti - stokes scattering can be quantified by the difference of the intensities @xmath56 that is equal to @xmath57 where we introduce the coordinate - dependent circular polarization degree of the wave @xmath58 @xmath59_{y}\\equiv \\frac{2{\\mathop{\\mathrm{im}}}e^{*}_{z}(\\bm r)e_{x}(\\bm r)}{|\\bm e(\\bm r)|^{2}}\\:.\\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] the quantity   changes from @xmath60 , for right - circularly polarized fields , to @xmath61 , for left - circularly polarized and it vanishes for linear polarization . </S>",

    "<S> our estimations show that it is of the order of 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> another necessary ingredient for the s / as asymmetry is the non - zero local circular polarization degree of the incident wave @xmath62 . moreover , to explain the experimentally observed unexpectedly strong s / as asymmetry it is required that it is close to the sw ellipticity , i.e. 0.8 . to justify the observed inversion of the s / as asymmetry </S>",
    "<S> the optical ellipticity should be reversed with respect to the case of a continuous co film . </S>",
    "<S> even though the incident electromagnetic wave is linearly ( @xmath14 ) polarized , the finite ellipticity is induced due to its refraction at the interfaces . </S>",

    "<S> a crude maxwell - garnett model  @xcite for the co / ceo@xmath5 nanowire array describes it as a slightly lossy dielectric with the averaged permittivity @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this maxwell - garnett approach yields @xmath70 , i.e. even smaller and also negative circular polarization . </S>",
    "<S> both these predictions are in stark contradiction to experiment . in order to resolve this controversy we have resorted to full - wave numerical simulation of the electric field profile inside the wires and its circular polarization degree using the cst microwave studio software package . </S>",
