    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) historically have been classified by the absence of hydrogen lines in their spectra .",
    "they are generally believed to be arising from explosions of white dwarf binary systems when the white dwarf accretes mass from the companion up to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "however , the exact nature of the progenitor remains largely unknown , particularly on the nature of the companion , with single - degenerate ( companion a main - sequence star or red giant ) or double - degenerate scenarios ( companion another white dwarf ) still under debate . in case for single - degenerate models ,",
    "it is possible that some hydrogen - rich materials remain in the circumstellar materials ( csm ) after the supernova explosion .",
    "this hydrogen was first observed in sn  2002ic , a normal sn  ia at the time of discovery , but later developed a broad h@xmath9 ( fwhm @xmath10 1800 @xmath11 ) component in the spectrum , believed to be arising from the interaction of the supernova debris with the dense csm @xcite .",
    "this could suggest that at least some type  ia have stellar companion ( though some have argued that the sn is a actually type  ic that has gone through heavy mass loss in a gas - rich environment , see @xcite ) .",
    "a similar example , sn  2005gj , was found to closely resemble sn  2002ic @xcite .",
    "the shock interaction between the fast expanding supernova envelope and the csm leads to vast amount of x - ray , optical , and radio emissions .",
    "thermal x - ray emission is expected to arise from the hot gas in the interaction region between the ejecta and the materials from the mass loss before the supernova explosion .",
    "x - ray emission from supernovae thus offers a channel to probe the properties and structure of the csm .",
    "the list of x - ray supernovae observed has grown extensively with missions such as _ swift _ since its launch in 2004 . as expected , a majority of the 47 candidates listed in the online _ swift _ x - ray supernova catalog maintained by s.  immler are core collapse supernovae under different categories ( sn  ii , iip , iin , iib , ibc ) . the only one exception is the type ia sn  2005ke in ngc 1371 , of which a @xmath10  3  @xmath0 detection had been reported by immler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from a merged 267.8  ks observation taken by _ swift _ at @xmath12  days after explosion . the reported @xmath13  kev unabsorbed flux is @xmath14  ergs @xmath15 s@xmath4 .",
    "if the result is correct , this would have been the first detected x - ray type ia superonva . on the other hand , the same set of _ swift _ data ( together with some late time _",
    "acis data taken 110 days after explosion ) was reanalyzed by @xcite ) and they concluded that no photons were detected within 14@xmath16 of the sn  2005ke position .",
    "moreover , neither sn  2002ic nor sn  2005gj had been detected in x - ray .",
    "we has recently completed a study of the entire _ swift _ archive to search for x - ray supernovae ( which have been discussed in paper i ) .",
    "we adopted an automated search of the _ swift _ data up to september 2010 and identified a total of 23 x - ray sne candidates .",
    "while most of our candidates are identical to those listed in the online catalog , we were not able to detect 5 of the previously published candidates , including sn  2005ke .",
    "we believe this is probably due to our searching strategy of doing a blind search instead of a targeted search .",
    "we therefore believe the detection of the first type ia x - ray sn to be uncertain at this stage .",
    "sn  2003lx is a type ia discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) on 2003 april 24 @xcite from an anonymous host galaxy at a distance 155  mpc ( redshift z = 0.0377 , @xmath17 = 71 km  s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) .",
    "the supernova was identified spectroscopically by subtracting the underlying galaxy spectrum using a method based on principal component analysis @xcite .",
    "the age of the supernova was estimated to be 10 days after maximum by fitting supernova spectral templates .",
    "the discovery sdss spectrum of sn  2003lx is shown in figure  [ sdss - spectrum ] , together with an elliptical galaxy template and a 7 days after maximum template of sn  ia from the suspect spectrum archive .",
    "it can be seen that the observed sn  2003lx spectrum can be well - fitted , in particular the absorption feature near 6150    due to si  ii  @xmath18 .",
    "we are therefore confident that sn  2003lx is indeed a type  ia supernova , even though no photometry of the supernova is available .",
    "the _ swift uvot _ observed the counterpart of the x - ray source in uv / optical band .",
    "we used the standard task _ uvotsource _ with a 5 radius circle extraction region to extract the optical / uv magnitudes .",
    "the uv / optical magnitudes of it are v = 15.71 , b = 16.78 , u = 17.31 , uvw1 = 18.49 , uvm2 = 19.64 and uvw2 = 19.42 . using the color transformation equations done by @xcite , the magnitudes in johnson filters system are v = 15.71 , b = 16.78 and u = 17.16 . in order to find the cross identifications of the source .",
    "a five arcsec radius search was carry out in _",
    "2mass _ and usno - b1.0 catalogs and corresponding ir source 2mass - j16192164 + 4105237 and usno - b1.0 - 1310 - 0266055 were found in the position of sn 2003lx with a offset of @xmath19 .",
    "the field of sn  2003lx was serendipitously imaged by the xrt on board of _ swift _ twice in 2008 january , with a total exposure time of 14  ks .",
    "the observation log is presented in table  [ tab - obs ] . as shown in figure  [ 2003lx - swift ] ,",
    "the position of the supernova is near the edge of the xrt field - of - view .",
    "a source is visible in both observations with the count rate determined from merging two data sets to be @xmath20 , corresponding to a @xmath21 detection . with the center of the x - ray source at only @xmath22  arcsec ( @xmath2  pixels , using _",
    "swift _ coordinates ) away from the optical position of the supernova , we believe the discovered x - ray source is indeed either sn  2003lx or a system that is closely associated with the supernova . assuming a power - law model with a galactic hydrogen column density @xmath23 , the best spectral fitting suggests @xmath24 and we derive the unabsorbed @xmath25 kev flux of the source to be @xmath26 erg @xmath27s@xmath28 , corresponding to a x - ray luminosity of @xmath29  ergs s@xmath28 assuming a distance to the source galaxy at 155  mpc .",
    "we also fitted the spectrum with a thermal model and the best fit value indicated that the temperature of the object is @xmath8 kev .",
    "[ tab - obs ]    ._swift _ observations of sn 2003lx [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we also investigated archival image of the field taken by the _",
    "rosat _ satellite ( figure  [ 2003lx - swift ] ) .",
    "the same field had been monitored by the pspc scan mode on 1990 july 30 for 760  seconds .",
    "assuming the same value of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as above , we calcluated at the newly - discovered _ swift _ source should yield a total of 13 counts in",
    "_ rosat_. however , only 3 net counts were detected ( total 38 counts and 35 background counts ) in the 1990 image . while the high background does reduce the significance of the result , we are still able to exclude the presence of the source at 91.2% confidence level in the _ rosat _ data . in addition ,",
    "an upper limit estimation method introduced by @xcite was used to calculate the upper limit flux , the upper limit from the position in 1990 is about @xmath32 erg @xmath27s@xmath28 which is much dimmer than the _ swift _ detection in 2008 . the positional coincidence and the absence of an earlier x - ray source",
    "strongly suggest that the discovered _ swift _ source is indeed a x - ray type  ia supernova .",
    "the xrs located at a anonymous galaxy of  155 mpc distance from us .",
    "the high x - ray flux number ( @xmath33 erg @xmath27s@xmath28 ) detected by _ swift _ suggests the corresponding x - ray luminosity of ( @xmath34  ergs s@xmath28 ) is relatively high to typical upper limit estimations of type ia @xcite . the dim x - ray upper limit flux ( @xmath32 erg @xmath27s@xmath28 ) detected by _",
    "rosat _ shows that there was no x - ray source at the emission position in 1990 .",
    "however , it is still possible to say the xrs could be a high variable agn . in order to justify the the identification of it",
    ", we used the criteria developed by @xcite to check .",
    "the criteria including ( a ) _ x - ray luminosity : _ sources with @xmath35  ergs s@xmath28 usually do not belong to purely star - forming non - agn galaxyies which mean for those source that the luminosities are greater than this value could be classified as a luminous agn .",
    "( b ) _ x - ray hardness : _ a high absorption ( @xmath36 ) would lowers a agn source observed flux to a level below the critical value .",
    "meanwhile , the observed spectrum of it should be extremely high ( effective power index of @xmath37 ) , this kind of sources can be flagged as obscured agns .",
    "( c ) _ x - ray - to - sfr correlation : _ using @xmath38 to estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "if a source has @xmath39  ergs s@xmath40 , we classify it as an agn .",
    "( d ) _ x - ray - to - optical flux ratio : _ the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio log(@xmath41 is a useful discriminator between agn and galaxy .",
    "a source with log(@xmath42 is mark as an agn .    for the xrs ,",
    "the estimated flux is about @xmath43  ergs s@xmath4 , which is obviously greater than the critical value set by criterion ( a ) .",
    "the effective power law index of the source is about 2.0 which is significant soft to reject the possibility that it is be an obscured agn .",
    "although we do not have an ir ( @xmath44 m in wavelength ) counterpart to see if the xrs passes the criterion ( c ) , we have a r - band magnitude 14.13 from sdss to test the criterion ( d ) .",
    "we first transform the sdss r - band magnitude into johnson r - band filter which gives r - band magnitude  13.99 corresponding to a @xmath45 of @xmath46 erg @xmath27s@xmath28 .",
    "the calculated value of x - ray optical flux ratio is @xmath47 .",
    "three out of four criteria suggest the xrs is not likely to be a typical agn , so we concluded that the host galaxy is not the main source of the strong x - ray flux",
    ".    a more sound explanation of the x - ray emission may be the circumstellar interaction that came from the mass lost by the companion of sn 2003lx . in order to understand the csm environment that can produced such a high luminosity , we use model of hydrodynamic interaction for a typical ia to estimate the mass loss rate of the companion @xcite . assuming a constant mass - loss rate @xmath48 and wind speed @xmath49 .the luminosity in the forward shock region is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mean mass per particle ( assume a h+he plasma , @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 is the cooling function of the plasma with respect to temperature @xmath54 .",
    "putting @xmath55 , @xmath56 and a forward shock velocity @xmath57 @xcite , a mass - loss rate of @xmath58 is calculated .",
    "this high mass - loss rate with low wind speed suggests a dense csm environment around the sn .",
    "shock wave interacts with such high dense csm produces the high observable x - ray flux .",
    "similar csm of mass - loss rate of @xmath59 were also found in sn 2002ic by @xcite where the csm may be a product formed by a slow and dense stellar wind from a super giant companion star like vy cma @xcite .",
