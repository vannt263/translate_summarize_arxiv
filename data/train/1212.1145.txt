    "closeness of gauge - couplings at the unification scale , neutrino masses , structure of lepton mixing matrix and hierarchy of quark mixing angles , dark matter , dark energy and baryon asymmetry of the universe are some of the still unexplained experimental facts .",
    "while framework of solving them all does nt exist yet , we can pick one issue and offer possible solution which may lead towards solving more of them .",
    "this can be done on different levels : choosing new fields and adding them within appropriate representation , extending the gauge symmetry i.e. following the gauge route , adding supersymmetry or extending and modifying basic concepts like quantum fields and nature of space - time , increasing levels of speculation with each step we take . here",
    "we will focus on the search for the dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "there are many evidences of dm existence @xcite and reasons for expecting it to be of particle nature .",
    "such a particle would have to be neutral , stable over cosmological scales and provide current dm relic density .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the group used for accommodation of dm and sm extension simultaneously describes more observations .",
    "special structures of the lepton mixing matrix and the quark mixing matrix give quite a strong hint for a flavor symmetry @xmath1 broken in a non - trivial way .",
    "requirement that at least two fermion generations can be unified by @xmath1 leads us to the conclusion that the best choice for @xmath1 is a discrete , non - abelian symmetry .",
    "@xcite since the discrete symmetry that stabilizes dark matter must be a remnant of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry @xcite , in most cases the used symmetry is @xmath2 gauge symmetry which is broken to discrete @xmath3 subgroup . preservation of @xmath3 symmetry stabilizes hidden sector in which the lightest particle is usually dm candidate .",
    "examples of @xmath3 symmetry are r - parity in minimal supersymmetric standard model and t - parity in little higgs model @xcite .    simplest way to analyze extension of sm with particles in hidden sector stabilized with @xmath3 symmetry is to add one singlet scalar to sm particles which has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , dm can as well consist of more particle types . in this case",
    "@xmath2 gauge symmetry is broken to group @xmath4 with @xmath5 and fields associated to its irreducible representations create hidden sector of the model .",
    "stabilization of dm with @xmath6 symmetry has been studied in @xcite where the dm candidate was neutral complex scalar singlet , while dm phenomenology with discrete @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 stabilizations of one extra sclalar doublet and one extra complex scalar singlet was investigated in @xcite . in @xcite , a non - abelian discrete group @xmath8",
    "was recently employed to stabilize hidden sector consisting of one or two component dm .    here",

    "it is a double valued counterpart of the dihedral group @xmath9 , also called @xmath10 , and it has been used in series of articles by m. frigerio and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for new understanding of family symmetries , @xmath11 and @xmath12 matrices and correlation of @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "we assign new particles to non - trivial irreducible representations of the group and stabilize the hidden sector preserving the symmetry after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we add two complex scalars in a doublet and three real scalars in singlet representations and we can compare the model with one component case of dm stabilization with @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 . with that choice of particles",

    "it also shows the potential terms and reactions which differentiate the @xmath0 from the @xmath8 dm stabilization .",
    "considering annihilation reactions , decays and dm conversion we use micromegas package @xcite,@xcite,@xcite to present its mass dependence on the strength of higgs portal coupling and investigate prospects of direct and indirect detection of lightest dm particle in this model . in section iv we conclude .",

    "after expansion @xmath69 around the vacuum from potential we can read these physical masses :    @xmath70    to examine the thermal relic abundance of added particles in @xmath0 model we use the micromegas package @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "relic abundance of the particles is governed by boltzmann equations which account for the change of the total number of particles we are interested in .    from five new added particles the lightest one",

    "@xmath98 annihilation cross - section depends on the decay width of sm higgs boson in all kinematically allowed final states @xmath99 of sm and of the hidden sector ( dark annihilations ) .",
    "the decaying higgs boson is a virtual particle with a mass of two times the mass of annihilating particles .",
    "the cross section of annihilating particles in the region @xmath100 reduces to @xcite @xmath101 depending primarily on @xmath55 coupling and dm mass @xmath102 . to determine the value of higgs portal coupling to @xmath62 we use the requirement that @xmath62 gives the right relic abundance within the wmap observations",
    "@xmath103 like done in @xcite while we assume @xmath104 have already decayed earlier to lighter particles .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath102 for the range of the @xmath102 from 4 gev to 1000 gev , often measured in experiments searching for dm , is shown on the figure [ alph5_mchi ] in the @xmath105 plane for mass of the @xmath106 particle @xmath107 2tev so that reactions ( d ) are allowed for every @xmath102 .",
    "the band shows values for which relic abundance is within the wmap values . in the region under the band @xmath108 and above the band",
    "there have to be other reactions strong enough to source the relic abundance to give correct @xmath109 the strength of the coupling @xmath55 in the region around higgs resonance @xmath110 is very weak compared to the cases where @xmath111 and @xmath112 and @xmath62 particles annihilate there very efficiently . in this region",
    "the value of @xmath55 does not have to be very strong to account for the viable cosmology . to analyze dependence of annihilation channel @xmath68 on masses @xmath113 and @xmath102 we observe dependence @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 with i=2 , 3 , 4 . to be sure reactions ( d )",

    "this choice of parameters for both regions gives good agreement with the graph on figure ( [ alph5_mchi ] ) .",
    "reason for this is that reactions of the type ( a ) strongly dominate over ( c ) .",
    "for example , cross - section of reactions @xmath118 is of the order of @xmath119 pb for center of mass momentum 500 gev while dominant sm channel for this set of parameters @xmath120 is @xmath121 pb for @xmath122 region ( for @xmath102=170 gev and @xmath123 gev ) .",
    "0.08    _ dark matter conversion processes _ are reactions in which number of dark matter particles remains the same",
    ". there are two types of processes .",
    "the `` dark '' annihilation reactions ( c1 ) are @xmath124 processes in which the number of dm particles of a particular species changes by two units .",
    "the reactions ( c2 ) can be regarded as dark co - annihilations . in these reactions",
    "the dm particle of one species annihilate with dm particle of another species .    if we had two hidden sectors each belonging to its particle type , allowed decay of the second lightest particle to the lightest one would make the lightest one dm candidate forming one - component dm . if this decay does nt exist or it is not kinematically allowed , we have two - component dm and two hidden sectors , with relic density of each of them obtained by calculating two coupled boltzmann equations .",
    "however , if the mass of the second lightest particle becomes smaller than @xmath125 times the mass of the lightest one @xcite , @xcite the inclusion of co - annihilations lowers the relic density and makes possible the simple use of one boltzmann equation .",
    "this is due to possibility of introducing the condition @xmath126 for @xmath127 number density of dark matter candidate species : i=@xmath128 and @xmath129 their number density in thermal equilibrium with background particle density @xmath130 increasing the number of particle types increases the number of hidden sectors contributing to total relic density and the number of coupled boltzmann equations we need to solve to find individual relic density of each sector .",
    "if masses of all particle types from hidden sectors are smaller than 1.5 times the mass of the lightest particle the situation becomes simple since the number of boltzmann equations reduces to one .",
    "in this case i=@xmath131 .",
    "it has been shown for a particular model @xcite that co - annihilations can lower @xmath132 by factor of 6 .",
    "the condition ( 6 ) can not be guaranteed when semi - annihilations are present @xcite .",
    "this assumption that dm particles which contribute to co - annihilation processes are in relative thermal equilibrium in the early universe is also taken in the micromegas calculation .    to investigate the influence of almost degenerate masses in quaternion model we choose masses of dm particles very similar as it is recommended for typical freeze - out temperature @xmath133 , while the recommended mass of the heavier particles , @xmath46 for i=2 , 3 , 4 , is @xmath134 under which co - annihilations become included . in the region of lower masses",
    "this effect is shown on the figure [ co ] .",
