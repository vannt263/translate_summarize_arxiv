    "galactic cosmic rays that have energies below @xmath3  ev are believed to be accelerated predominantly in the shocks of supernova remnants ( snrs ) . prior to the last two years , little experimental evidence existed to support this hypothesis .",
    "radio measurements show that many snrs emit synchrotron radiation from nonthermal electrons , but these measurements are not sensitive to emission from electrons that have energies greater than @xmath4  ev .",
    "gamma - ray measurements at energies @xmath5  ev also show that some snrs contain nonthermal particles ( @xcite ) , but the interpretation of these results is controversial ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent measurements of x - ray spectra of snrs have provided the best evidence to date that snrs may be responsible for most of the cosmic - ray acceleration in the galaxy .",
    "while the x - ray spectra of snrs have traditionally been modeled as thermal emission from shock - heated plasmas , the spectra of sn  1006 ( @xcite ) and rx  j1713.7@xmath63946 ( @xcite ) are dominated by nonthermal emission interpreted to be synchrotron radiation from electrons having energies up to @xmath3  ev .",
    "ic  443 may also contain a site that emits x - ray synchrotron radiation from electrons having energies at least as high as @xmath7  ev ( @xcite ) .",
    "we present the 260  kev spectrum of cassiopeia  a  ( cas  a ) measured using detectors on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite .",
    "this spectrum has a high - energy `` tail '' that extends to energies at least as high as 60  kev .",
    "the strong emission lines in the 0.510  kev spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) can be described by two - temperature thermal plasma models whose flux is dominated by emission from either swept - up material ( @xcite ) or shocked ejecta ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these models do not describe the higher - energy tail of the spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that has been detected up to at least 120  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of our analysis imply that both the x - ray tail and the radio spectrum ( @xmath8  jy , @xcite ) are produced by synchrotron radiation from a common population of nonthermal electrons whose spectrum extends up to at least @xmath9  ev .",
    "between 1996 march  31 and 1996 april  17 , cas  a  was observed for 186  ks using the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) on the rxte satellite .",
    "the pca ( @xcite ) and hexte ( @xcite ) comprise a 2 - 250  kev spectrophotometer that has an energy resolution @xmath1030% and a collecting area of about 7000  @xmath11 at 6  kev and of 800  @xmath11 at 60  kev .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] show the pca and hexte spectra of cas  a   for 91  ks of the pca data and for 96  ks of hexte data . because the strong emission lines may be fit by models with two thermal plasmas and with fluorescent k@xmath12 emission from iron in dust grains ( @xcite ) , we model these features using two raymond - smith components and a 6.40  kev gaussian .",
    "while such a model provides an adequate fit to the 0.510  kev spectrum , it does not fit the spectrum above @xmath10  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "at least one more component is needed to model the broad - band x - ray spectrum .",
    "we fit the broad - band spectrum using models that include only one additional component that is either a thermal bremsstrahlung , a power law , a power law that has an exponential cutoff , or a broken power law . in general , the high - energy spectrum is better fit by the nonthermal components than a thermal bremsstrahlung component .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum is better fit by a broken power law than a power law or a cut off power law .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes the best fit models that include either a broken power law component or a thermal bremsstrahlung component .",
    "abundances of some line - emitting elements are listed in the table because the abundances depend on the high - energy component .",
    "the abundances should be regarded as rough estimates because a better treatment requires plasmas that are not in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the values of @xmath13 in table  [ table1 ] were computed for only the @xmath14  kev portion of the pca and hexte spectra where the high - energy component dominates the flux .",
    "the `` @xmath15 '' errors quoted in this paper , which may be underestimated , were computed by finding the extrema of the @xmath13 contour that has a value of @xmath13 which is larger than the minimum value by 2.3 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the spectrum of the best fit model `` folded '' through the pca and hexte response matrices .",
    "the lower panel of this figure shows the ratio of the measured spectra to this model . aside from the uncertainty in the cross calibration of the pca and hexte , this ratio is dominated by systematic errors in the response matrix and the background spectrum for the pca and by statistical errors for the hexte .",
    "for example , the features near 2  kev and between 5 and 8  kev in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] reflect inaccuracies of the v2.0.2 pca response matrix that are observed when modeling pca spectra for other sources , such as the crab ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features are not evident in the fit to the spectrum of the gas imaging spectrometer no .  2 ( gis2 ) on the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the gis2 , pca , hexte , and osse ( oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory satellite , @xcite ) spectral data and the `` unfolded '' spectrum of the best fit model ( solid curve ) . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] also shows the spectrum of a model that includes only the two raymond - smith components and the fe  k@xmath12 dust component ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the spectra of several emission mechanisms  thermal and nonthermal bremsstrahlung , a pulsar , inverse compton scattering , and synchrotron radiation  could be described by a broken power law in the range of 1063  kev .",
    "each possibility is discussed in the context of cas  a.    it is unlikely that the high - energy x - ray tail of cas  a  is thermal . as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] and table  [ table1 ] ,",
    "the broad - band x - ray spectrum is not well fit by two or three thermal component models .",
    "furthermore , a physical interpretation of a model that has three thermal components is difficult .",
    "two of the components could be associated with the forward - shocked circumstellar material and the reverse - shocked ejecta .",
    "the third might result from a nonuniform distribution of the circumstellar or ejected matter .",
    "however , spatially - resolved spectroscopy shows that cas  a  has similar plasma conditions across the remnant ( @xcite ) .",
    "asvarov et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) suggest that the high - energy x - ray spectrum of cas  a   is dominated by nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "however , an estimate of the nonthermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) yields a 2050  kev effective photon index of @xmath16 , which is significantly smaller than the fitted index of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray tail of cas  a  appears to be too steep to be consistent with a nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission process .",
    "although pulsars can produce nonthermal x - ray continua , it is unlikely that the high - energy tail of cas  a  is produced by a pulsar .",
    "analyses of x - ray ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , radio ( @xcite ) and optical ( @xcite ) data reveal no evidence of pulsation and no bright point - like feature is observed near the center of the remnant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an inverse compton spectrum could be consistent with the shape of the tail , but the estimated flux is a factor of @xmath18 smaller than the measured flux at energies in the range of 1063  kev ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the other emission processes , both the shape and the flux of the high - energy component of the x - ray spectrum of cas  a  are consistent with a synchrotron radiation mechanism . in general ,",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of a snr is expected to span the entire range from radio to x - ray energies and to steepen gradually at or near x - ray energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the multiwavelength spectrum of cas  a   because the extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum to x - ray energies does not lie above the observed thermal emission at infrared wavelengths or below the x - ray spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and because the broken power law of table  [ table1 ] approximately describes a gradually steepening spectrum .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of figure  [ fig3 ] is a power - law spectrum with a @xmath19 cutoff .",
    "this photon spectrum corresponds to a power - law electron spectrum with a @xmath20 cutoff and assumes that the spectral distribution of synchrotron photons emitted by electrons of a common energy is a delta function .",
    "a better estimate of the synchrotron spectrum , which is expected to steepen more gradually than @xmath19 ( @xcite ) , requires a numerical simulation of the particle acceleration conditions appropriate for cas  a  including the effects ( 1 ) of synchrotron losses on the electron spectrum , ( 2 ) of possible curvature in the electron spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) of the spectral distribution of synchrotron photons for electrons of a given energy .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the radio ( @xcite ) , infrared ( @xcite ) , rxte , osse ( @xcite ) , egret ( @xcite ) , and whipple ( @xcite ) spectral data of cas  a. the estimated synchrotron spectrum is a single power law that has a @xmath21 cutoff .",
    "also shown are estimates of the photon spectra produced by nonthermal bremsstrahlung , by inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and by the decay of neutral pions .",
    "these latter three estimates were computed for electron and proton spectra that have a common spectral index of 2.54 using equation  13 and figure  3 of gaisser et  al .",
    "the electron density spectrum is assumed to be @xmath22  @xmath23  gev@xmath24 at 1  gev .",
    "the density of accelerated nuclei is assumed to be one hundred times larger than the density of accelerated electrons independent of energy .",
    "the nonthermal bremsstrahlung and @xmath25 decay spectra were computed for a density of nuclei in cas  a  of 30  @xmath23 .",
    "the shape of the nonthermal bremsstrahlung spectrum at energies below 1  mev is based on the shape of the nonthermal bremsstrahlung spectrum of sturner et  al .",
    "( 1997 , fig .",
    "the rxte data reveal that the x - ray continuum of cas  a  has a nonthermal high - energy `` tail . ''",
    "the tail ( 1 ) is qualitatively consistent with a simple model of synchrotron emission from snrs , ( 2 ) is inconsistent with the expected shape of a nonthermal bremsstrahlung spectrum , and ( 3 ) is inconsistent with the estimated inverse compton flux .",
    "no evidence of pulsation or of a bright central point - like feature has been reported .",
    "therefore , the tail is most likely produced by synchrotron radiation .",
    "x - ray synchrotron emission has important implications for particle acceleration in cas  a. the energy of a synchrotron photon , @xmath26 , is related to the energy of the emitting electron and the magnetic field strength by @xmath27  kev , where @xmath28 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath29 g and @xmath30 is the energy of the electron in units of @xmath31  ev . if the synchrotron spectrum extends to energies at least as high as 120  kev and the magnetic field is 1  mg ( the `` equipartition '' value , e.g.  @xcite ) , the accelerated electron spectrum extends up to at least @xmath9  ev . since electrons and protons are expected to be accelerated in the same manner at energies much larger than the rest mass energy of the proton ( @xcite ) , this result provides strong evidence for the acceleration of cosmic - ray protons in cas  a  to the same energies .",
    "the calculation of the equipartition value of the magnetic field leads to an estimate of the total amount of energy in accelerated protons and electrons of @xmath32  erg ( @xcite ) .",
    "this amount of energy is comparable to the average amount of energy required from a galactic snr ( @xmath33@xmath34  erg ) , over the lifetime of the remnant , if all of the galactic cosmic rays are accelerated in snrs .",
    "cas  a  is the fourth snr reported to exhibit evidence of x - ray synchrotron radiation .",
    "collectively , the results for cas  a , sn  1006 ( @xcite ) , rx  j1713.7@xmath63946 ( @xcite ) , and ic  443 ( @xcite ) support the hypothesis that galactic cosmic rays are accelerated predominantly in snrs .",
    "we thank apostolos mastichiadis and steve reynolds for advice about the expected shape of the spectrum of synchrotron radiation .",
    "we are grateful to jacco vink for many stimulating and thoughtful discussions about the data and about the implications of the data .",
    "we appreciate jennifer allen s careful review of the manuscript .",
