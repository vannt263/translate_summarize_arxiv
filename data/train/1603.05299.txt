    "most stars are born spinning rapidly . observations of young clusters reveal a wide range of rotation rates , with some stars spinning more than 100 times faster than the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scatter is generally attributed to the vortical nature of the turbulent interstellar clouds from which these stars form . though much of the initial angular momentum is lost during the gravitational collapse of a protostellar core , the dramatic decrease in the moment of inertia during",
    "the collapse is enough to impart a substantial rotational velocity in a large fraction of young stars . as the stars age",
    ", torques from magnetized stellar winds cause them to spin down and this reduces the scatter of the general population @xcite .",
    "the rapid rotation of young stars can have a dramatic influence on their internal structure and dynamics . in the most extreme cases ,",
    "the centrifugal force can alter the stars shape , causing it to be significantly oblate .",
    "models of rotating stars suggest that the effects of rapid rotation and oblateness can alter the stars s convective and radiative heat transport , reduce their luminosities , induce shearing instabilities and global circulations , and modify their rotational and compositional evolution @xcite .",
    "much of this work has focused on high - mass stars because of their short lifetimes , which makes them intrinsically more likely for fast rotation to play an important evolutionary role from birth to death , when they explode as supernovae and enrich the galaxy with heavy elements .",
    "high - mass stars are also luminous and large , which makes them relatively easy to observe . in the last fifteen years , researchers have been able to directly detect the oblate shapes of several rapidly - rotating , massive stars by means of optical and infrared interferometry @xcite .",
    "more direct detections are likely to be made in the future as observations continue to improve @xcite .",
    "one of the major theoretical predictions that has been addressed by these observations is the phenomenon of gravity darkening , which was introduced nearly a century ago in a pioneering paper by @xcite . for a massive star with a radiative outer envelope",
    ", von zeipel argued that the effective temperature of the stellar surface should scale as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the effective gravity , equal to the newtonian gravity plus the centrifugal force .",
    "this in turn implies that the radiative energy flux emitted from the stellar surface scales as @xmath4 . since the centrifugal force acts to reduce @xmath3 at the equator",
    ", gravity darkening predicts that the equatorial regions should be darker than the polar regions .",
    "though observations have confirmed the existence of gravity darkening , they suggest that the exponent may be somewhat less than predicted , with @xmath5 0.13 - 0.25 @xcite .",
    "lower - mass , late - type stars with convective envelopes are also expected to exhibit gravity darkening but again , with a smaller latitudinal variation than that predicted by von zeipel , with @xmath6 possibly as low as 0.08 @xcite .",
    "however , these expectations are based on simplified models of convection , with little observational guidance .",
    "substantial progress has been made in recent years in modeling the structure of rapidly rotating stars .",
    "a number of models have been used to investigate the effects of oblateness on stellar structure and evolution , with implications for asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "though these models are ostensibly @xmath7 , the thermodynamic quantities only depend on the effective gravitational potential . furthermore",
    ", like most stellar structure models , these models do not address the internal dynamics of oblate stars ; they solve only for the hydrostatic structure using a mixing - length formulation for convection , though some do include idealized cylindrical or shellular differential rotation profiles .",
    "@xcite took a somewhat different approach , calculating the non - spherical shape and internal structure of a rapidly rotating gaseous body using a three - dimensional , finite - element code with an unstructured grid . but",
    "again , the fluid dynamics was not considered . other analytical and numerical work on fluid dynamics in ellipsoidal geometries",
    "has focused on flows induced by precession ; for a recent example that employs a finite - element approach see @xcite .",
    "the first numerical model ( to our knowledge ) capable of capturing the internal dynamics of oblate stars is the ester ( evolution stellaire en rotation ) code @xcite .",
    "ester solves the axisymmetric , steady - state fluid equations self - consistently , taking into account nuclear energy generation , differential rotation and meridional circulation .",
    "however , convection is still treated using either a turbulent diffusion approximation @xcite or an isentropic approximation @xcite in which the effective convective heat flux is inferred from the nuclear energy generation and radiative heat flux under the assumption of a steady state .",
    "furthermore , published ester simulations are currently limited to high - mass stars with convective cores ( @xmath8 ) ; they have not yet considered convective envelopes .",
    "there have been many global 3d hydrodynamic ( hd ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of convection in the envelopes of lower - mass stars that address the rapid rotation regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these do not take into account the oblateness caused by the centrifugal force .",
    "in this study , we present the first 3d hd simulations of convection in the oblate envelopes of rapidly - rotating solar - type stars .",
    "these simulations are performed using the compressible high - order unstructured spectral difference ( chorus ) code recently introduced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wlm15 ) .",
    "we focus in particular on the influence of the oblateness on the convective structure , heat transport , mean flows , and the thermodynamic stratification .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mp ] we discuss the chorus code and its application to model oblate spheriodal geometries .",
    "we follow this in section [ sec : setup ] with a description of the numerical experiments that we have performed , which compare oblate simulations at varying rotation rates with their spherical counterparts .",
    "we consider rotation rates up to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the critical angular velocity at which the outward centrifugal force at the equator equals the inward gravitational force .",
    "we then present our results , focusing first on the convective structure and energetics ( section [ sec : con ] ) , then on the energy transport ( section [ sec : transport ] ) and finally on the mean flows and associated thermal gradients ( section [ sec : mean ] ) .",
    "we summarize our results , conclusions and future plans in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "modeling solar and stellar convection is challenging because the flow is turbulent and a vast range of spatial and temporal scales are involved . the reynolds number @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are characteristic velocity and length scales and @xmath14 is the kinematic viscosity ) is typically very high so direct numerical simulations that effectively resolve all scales in the convective envelope are far beyond today s computational affordability . in this study , we only aim to capture large - scale dynamics which are crucial in order to establish convection , differential rotation , and thermal flux balance .",
    "to do so , the three - dimensional chorus code is employed to perform a series of global simulations .",
    "chorus solves the equations of hydrodynamics using the high - order spectral difference method based on unstructured grids ( wlm15 ) .",
    "it can be naturally extended to deal with complex geometries including oblate spheriodal shells . in what follows",
    "we will generally refer to a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath15 , although the chorus code employs a cartesian coordinate system to represent a spherical or oblate spheriodal geometry using an unstructured mesh ( sec .",
    "[ sec : der_grid ] ) .",
    "we consider an ideal gas within an oblate spheroidal shell uniformly rotating at a constant rate @xmath16 about the @xmath17axis . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the bulk of mass is inside the inner radius of the oblate spheroidal shell , giving the gravitational acceleration @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the interior mass and @xmath21 is the radial unit vector . in slowly rotating solar - type stars ,",
    "the centrifugal force has typically been neglected in the momentum equation considering its sufficiently small magnitude relative to the buoyancy force ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in rapidly rotating stars , the centrifugal force is comparable to gravity and has a significant contribution to stellar structure .",
    "thus , in addition to the coriolis force , we include the centrifugal force in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the resulting equations in the rotating reference frame are @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are time , pressure , temperature , density and the velocity vector respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the total energy per unit volume and is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the adiabatic index ( the ratio of specific heats at fixed pressure and volume ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the viscous stress tensor for a newtonian fluid and is given by @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the strain rate tensor and @xmath14 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the term @xmath36 in equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) represents viscous heating .",
    "the diffusive flux @xmath37 is treated in the form of @xmath38 where the first component is a radiation diffusion flux with the molecular radiation diffusion coefficient @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "the second component is the entropy diffusion due to unresolved , subgrid - scale convective motions .",
    "this is a crude but commonly used representation of subgrid - scale ( sgs ) heat transport @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 is the specific entropy .",
    "the kinematic viscosity @xmath14 and the thermal diffusivity @xmath42 are assumed to be constant in time and space ( independent of radius ) , with magnitudes as specified in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the radiative diffusivity @xmath43 peaks at the inner boundary and decreases outward .",
    "it is computed from the temperature and density distribution according to the expression @xmath44 . since the initial @xmath28 and @xmath27 profiles depend only on the roche potential @xmath45 ( see section [ sec : ic ] ) , @xmath43 is also initially a function of @xmath45 alone .",
    "it does evolve in time along with @xmath28 and @xmath27 but variations along a potential surface remain relatively small so @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is chosen such that the total flux passing through the lower boundary is equal to the stellar luminosity @xmath48 ( see section [ sec : bdry ] ) .",
    "the use of the total energy equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) is advantageous from the point of view of the conservation of energy but it can pose problems in stellar interiors where the stratification is adiabatic to within about one part in @xmath49 . to capture the small departures from adiabaticity that drive the convection requires a very accurate numerical method .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : setup ] , we have artificially increased the luminosity in our models in order to achieve more tractable values of the mach number .",
    "this has the additional advantage that it increases the superadiabatic entropy gradient .",
    "thus , the nondimensional amplitude of the entropy gradient , @xmath50 , is only a factor of 600 less than the nondimensional temperature gradient @xmath51 . in other words ,",
    "the departure from adiabatic stratification is more than one part in @xmath52 .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of our spectral difference method ( described in section [ sec : method ] ) to be at least @xmath53 for length scales on the order of the entropy gradient and we see no signs of spurious behavior .      in the chorus code , the spectral difference ( sd ) method is used to discretize equations ( [ eqn : mass_conservation])-([eqn : energy ] ) in space by using their original strong form ( differential form ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the traditional discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method starts from the weak ( integrated ) form of these equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sd method can be viewed as a particular form of nodal dg method @xcite . to discretize these equations in space , the computational domain",
    "is divided into a collection of non - overlapping hexahedral elements .",
    "these elements in physical coordinates ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) are then transformed to a unit cube ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) using an isoparametric mapping with quadratic relations .",
    "consequently , the governing equations are transformed accordingly through jacobian matrices . in the unit cube , two sets of points are defined , namely the solution and flux points . in each coordinate direction of ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) ,",
    "@xmath60 solution points are chosen to be the chebyshev - gauss - quadrature points and @xmath61 flux points are selected to be roots of the legendre polynomial plus two end points .",
    "then the solution and flux polynomials can be built through lagrange interpolation basis functions . in order to deal with flux discontinuities across element interfaces , an approximate riemann solver ( rusanov or lax - friedrichs scheme ) and br1 @xcite scheme",
    "are employed for inviscid and viscous fluxes respectively . over each elemental interface ,",
    "@xmath62 flux points are needed to construct both inviscid riemman and viscous br1 fluxes where @xmath60 is the order of the accuracy of the sd method .",
    "the chorus code has proven to be particularly attractive for parallel computing ( wlm15 ) .",
    "the high - order sd method is locally intensive in term of computation associated with @xmath63 solutions points per element and requires a light amount of communication across elemental interfaces with @xmath62 flux points . for temporal discretization , a fourth - order accurate , strong - stability preserving five - stage runge - kutta scheme",
    "is employed @xcite .",
    "for further details on the numerical method see wlm15 .      for anelastic codes ,",
    "the initial conditions are often based on a 1d , unstable , equilibrium , polytropic solution derived from the governing equations with an imposed superadiabatic entropy gradient , @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "however , this approach does not apply here for two reasons .",
    "one is the exclusion of the centrifugal force .",
    "taking this into account in the initial hydrostatic balance requires a 2d setup ( both radial and latitudinal directions ) which poses a problem for anelastic codes that generally expand about a 1d reference state .",
    "the second reason that we can not use a typical anelastic setup is the compressible nature of chorus . in an anelastic code",
    ", the superadiabatic entropy gradient can be incorporated into the thermodynamic perturbations and decoupled from the specification of the reference state . since chorus does not linearize the equations about a reference state , this does not apply .",
    "for these reasons , we take a different approach .",
    "instead , we initialize chorus with a 2d , hydrostatic , adiabatic stratification ( @xmath65 ) . this has the advantage that it can be defined analytically , even for oblate geometries .",
    "however , in contrast to some anelastic setups , this initial state is not an equilibrium solution to the equations because it does not satisfy the steady - state energy equation .",
    "in particular , there is a non - zero convergence of the radiative flux which heats the plasma and establishes the superadiabatic entropy gradient that eventually triggers convection . in this section",
    "we describe how this initialization is accomplished for both spherical and oblate spheroidal shells .",
    "note that equations ( [ eqn : p_initial])-([eqn : t_initial ] ) reduce to the 1d polytropic solutions of @xcite if the centrifugal force term is omitted from the effective gravitational potential in equation ( [ eqn : potential ] ) .",
    "as shown there , @xmath87 corresponds to the number of density scales heights across the shell .",
    "the initial profile is completely specified by choosing the parameters @xmath20 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath16 , @xmath32 , @xmath40 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . for our oblate simulations ,",
    "we use the 2d profiles in equations ( [ eqn : p_initial])-([eqn : t_initial ] ) and for our spherical shell simulations we use the 1d profiles of @xcite which can be obtained from ( [ eqn : p_initial])-([eqn : t_initial ] ) by setting @xmath90 . since we wish to model solar - type stars , we use appropriate parameter values of @xmath91 , @xmath92 g @xmath93 , @xmath94 g , @xmath95 erg g@xmath96 k@xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "note also that the initialization procedure described here implies that the oblate geometries will have both a larger volume and a larger mass than their spherical counterparts ( see section [ sec : setup ] ) .",
    "these polytropic , adiabatic initial conditions do not satisfy the schwarzschild criterion for convective instability , which requires a negative ( superadiabatic ) radial entropy gradient ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "furthermore , the rayleigh number @xmath99 is subcritical .",
    "thus , convection will not occur immediately .",
    "however , as noted at the beginning of this section , there is a fixed radiative heat flux @xmath100 that carries the stellar luminosity in through the bottom boundary ( see also sections [ sec : hydro ] , [ sec : bdry ] and [ sec : flux ] ) .",
    "the convergence of this heat flux heats the plasma in the shell , raising its temperature .",
    "since the temperature at the top is fixed ( see section [ sec : bdry ] ) , this heating of the plasma increases the temperature gradient .",
    "soon the temperature gradient becomes both superadiabatic and supercritical , and convection ensues .",
    "the temperature and entropy gradients will eventually equilibrate when the simulation achieves flux balance , such that the combined convective and diffusive energy fluxes carry the full stellar luminosity through the entire shell ( see section [ sec : flux ] ) .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy_s60 ] , which shows how the entropy gradient in a typical simulation ( s60 ; see table [ tab : parameters ] ) evolves with time .",
    "it starts out adiabatic ( @xmath65 ) , but it quickly becomes superadiabatic ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the heating of the shell due to the convergence of the radiative heat flux not only increases the temperature , it also raises the adiabat .",
    "this increases the negative entropy gradient throughout the shell , but particularly near the upper boundary . by @xmath102 6 days",
    ", it becomes superadiabatic enough to trigger convection ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ke ] and [ fig : ke_so ] below ) . by @xmath102 50 days ,",
    "the simulation has achieved flux balance and the entropy gradient has equilibrated .",
    "[ sec : bdry ] the inner and outer boundaries , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , are assumed to be impenetrable and free of viscous shear stresses @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the unit vector normal to equipotential surfaces @xmath45 and pointing radially outward .    at the bottom boundary a fixed heat flux",
    "is imposed such that @xmath108 where @xmath48 is the stellar luminosity and @xmath109 is the area of the inner surface @xmath103 . for the spherical simulations , @xmath110 , but for the oblate simulations the area is greater than this and",
    "is calculated numerically . since @xmath111 at @xmath103 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : entropy_s60 ] ) , this imposed heat flux is almost entirely due to the radiative diffusion term @xmath112 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath43 is specified such that equation ( [ eq : fbot ] ) is satisfied ( see section [ sec : hydro ] ) .    at the upper boundary , @xmath104",

    "then the potential at the pole can be compared to that at an arbitrary polar angle @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting cubic equation for @xmath115 is @xmath116 by solving equation ( [ eqn : geo_equipotential2 ] ) for @xmath117 , the axisymmetric ( @xmath118-independent ) surface is obtained .",
    "the inner equipotential surface can be computed in a similar way by replacing the outer polar radius @xmath83 with the inner polar radius @xmath82 in equation ( [ eqn : geo_equipotential2 ] ) .",
    "the geometry of an oblate spheroidal shell is then defined by both inner and outer equipotential surfaces .",
    "it is straightforward to generate grids for spherical shells by using commercial or publicly available grid generation software ( e.g. gmsh ) .",
    "spherical shells can also be represented by a cubed - sphere grid @xcite .",
    "however , it is very challenging to generate grids for oblate spheroidal shells as defined above because we need to represent the curvature on both the bottom and top surfaces very accurately in order to conserve mass , momentum , and energy . here , an alternative approach has been chosen .",

    "the computational domains for the oblate spheroidal shells are derived from the spherical shell using the approach described in section [ sec : der_grid ] .",
    "as described there , the inner and outer radii at the poles are the same as in the spherical cases , but the depth of the convection zone becomes wider at low latitudes due to the centrifugal distortion .",
    "the low mach numbers of deep stellar interiors pose a significant challenge for fully compressible codes .",
    "in particular , if explicit timestepping is used as is the case here , they set strict limits on the size of the time step needed to satisfy the courant - freidrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "they also imply long thermal equilibration times .",
    "we address this challenge as in previous simulations by artificially increasing the luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* wlm15 ) .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the velocity amplitudes ( which scale roughly as @xmath139 ) and decreasing the thermal relaxation time . for all simulations reported here we use @xmath140 , where @xmath141 erg s@xmath96 is the solar luminosity .",

    ". however , the effective rossby number ro @xmath150 in our simulations is artificially increased by roughly a factor of forty because of the larger convective velocity amplitudes ( relative to a star rotating at the same rotation rate ) .",
    "this problem is sometimes addressed by artificially increasing the rotation rate along with the luminosity to achieve a desired rossby number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we do not have that luxury here . since we include the centrifugal force ,",

    "the oblateness of these stars is comparable to a real star rotating at these rotation rates but the rossby number is about a factor of forty higher .",
    "we could in principle remedy this situation by adjusting @xmath20 and @xmath19 or we could simply accept that , though the convection in our simulations is strongly rotationally constrained ( ro @xmath152 ; see table [ tab : diagnostics ] ) , it is less so than in a real star with the same rotation rate . for this initial study",
    "we follow the latter approach and take it into account in our interpretation .",
    "all of the simulations discussed here employ the third - order accuracy spectral difference method on 393,216 hexahedral elements , resulting in a total of 10,616,832 degrees of freedom ( @xmath153 ) .",

    "the number of solution points in longitude is twice this at the equator , 384 , but diminished toward higher latitudes to achieve a nearly uniform horizontal resolution .",

    "however , in order to make contact with the previous global simulations of @xcite , we also run a series of spherical simulations in which @xmath14 and @xmath42 are reduced as the rotation rate is increased in order to maintain the supercriticality of the convection .",
    "these are listed in tables [ tab : parameters ] and [ tab : diagnostics ] as cases @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . in these simulations , @xmath160 , where the normalization is chosen such that @xmath154 @xmath155 s@xmath96 when @xmath161 .",

    "the supercriticality of these simulations is not easy to establish due to the lack of a linear theory for convection in oblate , compressible spheroids and due to the nature of the initial conditions , which do not express an unstable equilibrium ( sec .",

    "when interpreting the ke data in table [ tab : diagnostics ] and below , it is important to realize that the oblate shells have more mass and volume than their spherical counterparts .",
    "this is a consequence of our initialization approach discussed in section [ sec : ic ] . in particular , the density on the inner equipotential surface , @xmath173 is the same for all simulations .",
    "however , the oblate geometries have a greater volume , which gives rise to a larger mass .",
    "the mass of the convective envelope @xmath174 for each simulation is listed in table [ tab : parameters ] relative to the central mass @xmath20 .",
    "the most extreme case , o120 , has about 37% more mass in the convection zone than s120 .",
    "this is somewhat less than the volume difference , which is about 51% greater in case o120 than in s120 ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "thus , although the volume - averaged ke density listed in table [ tab : diagnostics ] is slightly smaller in case o120 compared to s120 , the total kinetic energy integrated over the entire volume ( in ergs ) is larger by about 36% , comparable to the difference in mass . in other words ,",
    "the mean kinetic energy per unit mass ( @xmath175 multiplied by @xmath171 and divided by @xmath174 ) is almost the same in cases o120 and s120 ( within 1% ) .",
    "this is a measure of the density - weighted velocity amplitude .",
    "the other oblate cases have slightly higher kinetic energy per unit mass than their spherial counterparts , ranging from 3% higher in o60 to 6% higher in o70 , o100 , and o110 to 11% and 15% higher in cases o90 and o80 .",
    "the downward trend in this ratio for @xmath176 may be due to a saturation of drke / ke in the fastest - rotating oblate stars ( see section [ sec : energetics ] ) .",
    "note also that @xmath177 in all cases ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) , justifying our assumption in section [ sec : ic ] that the bulk of the mass lies inside the inner radius .",

    "the evolution of the kinetic energy for the @xmath135 and @xmath134 series of simulations is illustrated in figure [ fig : ke ] .",
    "all of these simulations start from the polytropic , adiabatic stratification described in section [ sec : ic ] .",
    "therefore , the initial entropy gradient is zero for all cases . with the heating due to the radiative heat flux at the bottom and the constant temperature at the top",
    ", the entropy gradient becomes superadiabatic .",
    "once the negative entropy gradient is built up and the rayleigh number @xmath99 exceeds a critical value , the flow locks on to the fastest - growing eigenmode which then grows exponentially .",
    "however , even before this exponential growth phase , there is a slow initial algebraic growth in the ke in response to the radiative heating .",
    "we have verified that this growth does not occur when the luminosity is set to zero so it is not due to numerical errors , such as those associated with the conservation of angular momentum or hydrostatic balance , which can pose problems on unstructured grids .",
    "we find our spectral difference method and grid generation procedure described in section [ sec : mp ] to be very effective at minimizing these numerical errors . to demonstrate this , consider the three cartesian components of the angular momentum vector , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , and @xmath318 , integrated over the volume of the shell .",
    "if the numerics were perfect , these three values would remain zero relative to the rotating frame throughout the simulation .",
    "our test cases with zero luminosity indicate that the errors associated with angular momentum conservation and hydrostatic balance are on the order of one part in @xmath319 . in order to prevent the gradual accumulation of these errors over tens of thousands of iterations",
    ", we apply an angular momentum correction procedure every 5000 iterations as described in wlm15 . for our most oblate simulation , case o120 , near the end of the simulation interval ( @xmath320 77 days ) , we find that @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is the initial angular momentum of the shell .",
    "the structure of the flow in this initial establishement period suggests that it is indeed weak convective motions that are induced by the heating .    the duration of this initial establishment period before the exponential growth phase varies with the rotation rate and oblateness . as the rotation rate",
    "is increased , this duration increases from 6 days for case @xmath144 to 12 days for case @xmath145 ( figure [ fig : ke]a ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the stabilizing influence of rotation , which requires a greater entropy gradient to trigger convection .",
    "a similar effect is also observed in the oblate spheroidal shell simulations shown in figure [ fig : ke]b . in order to assess the effect of oblateness on the growth and saturation of the convection ,",
    "four cases are compared in figure [ fig : ke_so ] . the initial establishment period in case @xmath146 is only a little longer than that in case @xmath144 , which is expected because the oblateness in case @xmath146 is minimal as shown in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "in contrast , the difference between cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 is pronounced ( about @xmath325 days ) , implying that the significant oblateness in case @xmath147 has a substantial influence on the establishment of a supercritical entropy gradient . this can be attributed to the greater depth of the convection zone at the equator for the oblate cases , which dilutes the flux convergence and weakens thermal gradients .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : ke ] and table [ tab : diagnostics ] that the more rapidly - rotating cases saturate at a lower level of ke than the more slowly - rotating cases . this is a consequence of the stabilizing effects of rotation and rotational shear ( differential rotation ) and it occurs in both the spherical and oblate cases .",
    "however , the stabilizing influence on ke is somewhat larger in the oblate cases .",
    "for example , the ke in o120 is about 36% of that in o60 whereas the ratio between s120 and s60 is 41% .",
    "however , recall that ke is the mean kinetic energy density . if the difference in volume is taken into account , then the total kinetic energy in case o120 is about 51% of the total kinetic energy in o60 .",
    "we also note that the decrease in total ke with increasing @xmath326 is a result that is sensitive to our chosen path through parameter space , which is to keep @xmath14 and @xmath42 constant .",
    "recall from section [ sec : setup ] that we decrease @xmath14 and @xmath42 as we increase @xmath326 in the _ a _ series of simulations ( s60a , s80a , s100a , and s120 ) in order to maintain a relatively constant supercriticality . in these simulations ,",
    "the total ke decreases only slightly from s60a to s100a and is in fact largest for s120 , due largely to a strong differential rotation ( table [ tab : diagnostics ] ) .    for both the spherical and the oblate cases , more of the ke",
    "is contained in the differential rotation as @xmath326 is increased ( table [ tab : diagnostics ] ) .",
    "this is a common feature of global convection simulations and is attributed to the enhancement of the convective reynolds stress ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the spherical cases , the ratio of drke / ke increases steadily over the entire range in rotation rates , from 60 to 120 @xmath142 .",
    "however , interestingly , the drke / ke ratio seems to saturate in the oblate cases at about 0.61 for @xmath327 . in this range of rotation rates ,",
    "the drke / ke ratio is less than in the corresponding spherical cases , indicating that pronounced oblateness tends to suppress differential rotation .",
    "this result may or may not be related to the observed saturation of the differential rotation @xmath0 in rapidly - rotating stars , which will be discussed in section [ sec : dr1 ] . for more moderate rotation rates , @xmath328 ,",
    "the oblate cases tend to have a slightly higher ratio of drke / ke compared to their spherical counterparts .",
    "in contrast to drke / ke , the mcke / ke ratio decreases as @xmath326 is increased .",
    "this again is commonly seen in spherical convection simulations and is attributed to the nature of the reynolds stress and the tendency for flows to align with the rotation axis as expressed by the taylor - proudman theorem @xcite . in short ,",
    "the meridional circulation is established in response to the convective angular momentum flux in a process known as gyroscopic pumping @xcite . as the rotational influence",
    "is increased , this flux becomes perpendicular to the @xmath56 axis and is less effective at inducing a meridional circulation .",
    "though both the spherical and oblate cases exhibit a decrease in the mcke / ke ratio as @xmath326 is increased , the effect is somewhat more pronounced in the oblate cases .",
    "furthermore , the mcke / ke ratio is generally less in the oblate cases than in the spherical cases with the same rotation rate . in other words",
    ", the oblateness tends to suppress the mc , at least in terms of its kinetic energy .",
    "this is somewhat of a surprise ; one might have expected the oblateness to induce strong baroclinic circulations but we see no evidence of this .",
    "we will return to these issues in section [ sec : dr1 ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : con_pattern ] , the structure of the convection is illustrated .",
    "shown is the velocity normal to equipotential surfaces @xmath329 , in mollweide projection for a horizontal surface in the upper convection zone .",
    "all simulations are dominated by a series of columnar convective rolls approximately aligned with the rotation axis but sheared slightly in the prograde direction at low latitudes by the differential rotation .",
    "these are the well - known banana cells characteristics of convection in rotating shells for laminar parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "there is little apparent difference between simulations in spherical shells and those in oblate spheroidal shells . in particular ,",
    "the azimuthal wavenumber of the banana cell pattern is similar , on the order of @xmath330 for both s120 and o120 .",
    "this qualitative similarity in appearance is confirmed by the quantitative power spectra , which are compared in figure [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "each curve represents the power spectrum obtained by applying a spherical harmonic transformation to the normal velocity fields shown in figure [ fig : con_pattern ] and then plotting the resulting power as a function of the spherical harmonic degree , which is , in effect , the horizontal wavenumber .",
    "the differences between the spherical and oblate cases are insignificant .    .",
    "however , closer scrutiny of figure [ fig : con_pattern ] does reveal some notable differences , particularly in the polar regions .",
    "it is well known that convection in rotating spherical shells can be divided into two distinct dynamical regions , delineated by the so - called tangent cylinder @xcite .",
    "the tangent cylinder is a 2d cylindrical surface with a central axis aligned with the rotation axis and a cylindrical radius that is equal to the radius of the base of the convection zone at the equator . outside the tangent cylinder ,",
    "the convection is generally dominated by banana cells or related vortex sheets .",
    "these are the equatorial modes .",
    "meanwhile , the polar convection modes inside the tangent cylinder tend to be more horizontally isotropic , particularly at moderate rossby numbers and high rayleigh numbers .",
    "though all simulations exhibit a clear difference between polar and equatorial modes , the difference is much more pronounced in the fastest - rotating oblate cases .",
    "this can be seen most clearly by comparing cases s120 and o120 in figure [ fig : con_pattern]@xmath162 and @xmath331 . in case s120 , the polar modes are highly anisotropic and linked with the equatorial banana modes . by contrast , in case o120 , the polar modes clearly decouple from the equatorial modes and exhibit a more isotropic cellular structure ( see also figs .  [",
    "fig : vn_so ] and [ fig : vn_fat ] below ) .",
    "the same effect can also be seen in cases s90 and o90 ( figure [ fig : con_pattern]@xmath332 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the difference in the structure of the polar convection modes in cases s120 and o120 is further illustrated in figure [ fig : vn_so ] . here",
    "it can be seen that the polar convection in case o120 is not only more isotropic and more decoupled from lower latitudes , but it is also more vigorous . we will return to this issue in section [ sec : flux ] .",
    "we close this section with an orthographic view of case o120 from a point closer to the equatorial plane , highlighting its oblateness .",
    "differential rotation established by convection is a common feature in stars .",
    "the latitudinal angular velocity contrast on the surface , @xmath0 , is an important quantity both for interpreting stellar observations and for dynamo theories .",
    "various observational techniques have been employed to measure @xmath0 , and to investigate the relationship between @xmath0 and the stellar angular velocity @xmath16 .",
    "these observational techniques range from photometric variability studies @xcite to doppler imaging techniques @xcite and fourier transform methods @xcite .",
    "global numerical simulations and mean - field models of convection in spherical shells have also been used to study that relationship @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 is often defined as the difference in angular velocity between the equator and @xmath333 latitude , namely , @xmath334    the differential rotation profiles for all of the simulations considered in this paper are solar - like in the sense that the equator rotates more rapidly than the polar regions ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "detailed rotation profiles will be discussed in section [ sec : mean ] . here",
    "we focus on the dependence of @xmath0 ( computed using eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] below ) on @xmath326 , which is shown in figure [ fig : delta_omega ] .    for the spherical simulations @xmath144-@xmath145 , @xmath0 is insensitive to @xmath326 , showing no clear trend .",
    "this is somewhat of a surprise , since previous studies of convection in rotating spherical shells exhibit an increase of @xmath0 with @xmath326 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , recall from section [ sec : setup ] that in this series of simulations @xmath14 and @xmath42 were kept constant as @xmath16 was increased .",
    "by contrast , @xcite decreased @xmath14 and @xmath42 ( @xmath336 @xmath337 ) in order to maintain a relatively constant supercriticality .",
    "this is the motivation behind our _ a _ series of simulations , represented in figure [ fig : delta_omega ] by the blue boxes .",
    "these use the same scaling for @xmath14 and @xmath42 as in @xcite , and we find similar results",
    ". in particular , @xmath0 monotonically increases with @xmath326 approximately as a power law ; @xmath338 with @xmath339 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the results of brown et al .",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though our exponent is somewhat steeper than their value of @xmath340 , valid for rossby numbers below about 0.4 .",
    "these trends are generally consistent with observations , which suggest @xmath341 for solar - type stars @xcite",
    ". however , this observed scaling relation only holds out to about @xmath342 , after which @xmath0 may remain constant or even decrease with @xmath326 , though observational evidence for this is still only preliminary @xcite .",
    "this saturation and perhaps reversal of the @xmath0 vs @xmath326 scaling relation appears to be associated with a similar saturation of the magnetic field strength , @xmath122 , which increases with @xmath326 until about the same point , @xmath343 , beyond which @xmath122 becomes approximately independent of @xmath326 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the saturation of the @xmath0 vs @xmath326 relationship for rapidly - rotating solar like stars is likely due to strong lorentz - force feedbacks associated with vigorous dynamo action .    however , our simulations suggest that oblateness may also contribute to the saturation of @xmath0 for very fast rotation rates .",
    "we already noted in section [ sec : energetics ] that the drke / ke ratio saturates at about 0.61 for @xmath344 ( @xmath345 ) . this result",
    "is also reflected in the @xmath0 plot of figure [ fig : delta_omega ] , which shows a peak value at @xmath346 ( @xmath347 ) , only for the oblate cases . at more rapid rotation rates",
    ", the oblateness seems to supress the differential rotation .",
    "this is likely due to the decoupling between polar and equatorial modes noted in section [ sec : patterns ] .",
    "if banana cells reach beyond the tangent cylinder and into the polar regions as in case s120 , the associated reynolds stress can efficiently spin down the poles , enhancing the differential rotation .",
    "however , if the polar and equatorial modes decouple due to oblateness as in case o120 , this can inhibit the angular momentum transport and diminish @xmath0 .",
    "we will explore the mean flows in more detail in section [ sec : mean ] . however , before we proceed , one more comment is warranted in order to relate our simulations to previous work .",
    "our numerical approach described in section [ sec : mp ] neglects the effect of differential rotation on oblateness .",
    "is this justified ?",
    "@xcite showed that differential rotation could significantly distort the shape of rapidly rotating stars compared to corresponding cases with uniform rotation .",
    "however , in their model the reference rotation rate @xmath16 was allowed to be larger than the critical rotation rate @xmath10 and an anti - solar differential rotation profile was introduced to achieve stable solutions .",
    "this extreme situation is likely to be rare in real stars .",
    "furthermore , @xcite considered a full , 2d stellar structure model that included differential rotation down to the region of energy generation in the stellar core . given the sensitivity of energy generation to the thermal structure , even a slight oblateness of the core could have a substantial influence on the stellar luminosity .",
    "if the differential rotation is solar - like in the sense that the equator spins faster than the pole and if it is confined to the convective envelope , then we expect the differential rotation to have a negligible influence on the oblateness .",
    "this is demonstrated in appendix [ appen : a ] .",
    "from a star s perspective , perhaps the most important function of convection is energy transport ; it carries the energy liberated by fusion in the core to the surface , where that energy is then radiated into space .",
    "since this paper is the first to consider 3d simulations of convection in oblate stars , we believe that it is useful to consider the issue of outward energy transport with some care .    a careful derivation is given in appendix [ appen : b ] but",
    "the result is analogous to previous models of convection in spherical shells .",
    "four principle components of the energy flux are involved in transporting energy in the outward direction , namely the enthalpy flux @xmath348 , the kinetic energy flux @xmath349 , the radiative flux @xmath350 and the diffusive entropy flux @xmath351 . in a statistically steady state",
    ", these four fluxes together must account for the full luminosity imposed at the bottom boundary such that @xmath352 explicit expresstions for @xmath353 , @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 are given in appendix [ appen : b ] . for a spherical shell @xmath357 but",
    "this is no longer true for an oblate shell where we compute @xmath358 numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_balance-60 ] shows the flux balance through equipotential surfaces for cases @xmath144 and @xmath146 .",
    "it is apparent that the energy flux distribution in case @xmath144 is very similar to that in case @xmath146 , which is expected because of the small oblateness . by design , the radiative flux @xmath350 carries all of the imposed flux at the bottom where the normal velocity vanishes , as do @xmath354 and @xmath353 . the radiative flux @xmath350 also dominates the heat transport in the lower convective envelope while the entropy flux @xmath351 carries energy through the top boundary and the upper convective envelope .",
    "the strong correlations between normal velocities and temperature fluctuations yield the enthalpy flux @xmath348 , which gradually increases towards the top from the bottom until it peaks near @xmath359 .",
    "it then drops down to zero rapidly as it approaches the impenetrable top boundary .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : flux_balance-120 ] , the difference in the energy flux distribution between cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 is more significant .",
    "this is especially true for the enthalpy flux @xmath348 and the entropy flux @xmath351 . in case @xmath145",
    ", @xmath348 reaches a maximum value of 0.32 around @xmath360 while the peak @xmath353 value in case @xmath147 is only 0.25 , achieved around @xmath361 .",
    "this suggests that the oblateness is slightly inhibiting the net convective energy transport through the shell .",
    "the normalized sum of the four principle flux components in all of our simulations is close to one throughout the shell , signifying that they have achieved an equilibrated state .",
    "it is well known that rapid rotation also tends to inhibit convection @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in our simulations through its effect on the mean entropy stratification .",
    "we find that the convection is less able to establish an adiabatic profile throughout the convection zone in the rapidly rotating simulations .",
    "instead , much of the convection zone remains slightly superadiabatic ( @xmath362 ) .",
    "the radial profile of the normal entropy gradient @xmath363 for our simulations is shown in figure [ fig : dsdr ] , highlighting the dependence on the rotation rate .",
    "for the spherical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdr]a ) , the normal entropy gradient exhibits a greater departure from the adiabatic profile as the rotation rate is increased from @xmath364 to @xmath365 .",
    "this signifies a decrease in the efficiency of the convective energy transport for two reasons .",
    "first , the convection is less able to mix entropy to establish an adiabatic stratification .",
    "second , the reduced enthalpy flux ( @xmath353 ) in the upper convection zone requires a steeper entropy gradient ( larger @xmath356 ) in order to satisfy the flux balance equation ( [ eq : fbalance ] ) .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the upper convection zone for the oblate simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdr]b ) . here",
    "again , the magnitude of the superadiabatic entropy gradient increases with increasing @xmath326 .",
    "however , this trend reverses near the outer boundary as highlighted in the inset .",
    "this can be attributed to the larger surface area of the oblate spheroids . in order for each simulation to achieve equilibrium ,",
    "the total flux through the outer boundary must equal the total flux imposed through the inner boundary , which is in turn equal to the luminosity , @xmath48 . in our simulations ,",
    "the flux through the outer boundary is carried by the entropy flux @xmath356 , which is proportional to the normal entropy gradient , as expressed in equation ( [ eqn : fu ] ) .",
    "thus in order to achieve equilibrium , @xmath356 must be equal to @xmath366 at @xmath104 , where @xmath367 is the area of the outer surface .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath48 , the @xmath356 is reduced as @xmath367 is increased . in other words , the total luminosity is spread over a larger area in oblate stars so the flux through any fixed area on the surface is reduced .    in order to further investigate the effect of oblateness on the entropy stratification , we compare four cases in figure [ fig : dsdr_so ] . as expected",
    ", there is little difference between cases @xmath144 and @xmath146 since the oblateness is small ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "however , the normal entropy gradient in case @xmath147 is significantly smaller in magnitude than in case @xmath145 .",
    "several factors contribute to this result .",
    "one is the larger surface area , which dilutes @xmath356 in the upper convection zone as noted in the previous paragraph .",
    "another is the somewhat less efficient convective transport , as noted above in the discussion of figure [ fig : flux_balance-120 ] .",
    "yet another is the larger depth of the convection zone , which tends to weaken thermal gradients in general .",

    ", the von zeipel model predicts that the equatorial regions should possess less energy flux than the polar regions and should therefore appear darker .",
    "one problem with this result is that the radiative envelopes of oblate stars are unlikely to be barotropic ( @xmath377 ) , as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "still , the qualitative prediction of gravity darkening has indeed been verified observationally for massive stars , though the quantitative contrast between equator and pole is less than predicted @xcite .",
    "*    however , the von zeipel model does not apply to late - type stars with convective envelopes . in these stars ,",
    "the surface flux is not dominated by @xmath355 so the line of reasoning that gives rise to gravity darkening should be regarded as questionable .",
    "several attempts have been made to extend the von zeipel model to late - type stars but they all involve assumptions about the nature of the convective heat transport . @xcite",
    "used mixing - length models of convection to predict a result that resembles gravity darkening but with a weaker latitudinal dependence , such that the emergent flux is @xmath378 .",
    "however these mixing - length models are local in nature and do not take into account coherent structures such as banana cells that are known to dominate convective heat transport in global simulations of convection in rotating spherical ( or spheriodal ) geometries . @xcite and",
    "* @xcite * also presented a model that in principle should apply to convective envelopes as well as radiative envelopes .",
    "however , this model assumes that the convective heat flux is directed normal to @xmath45 surfaces , which may or may not be true .",
    "global convection simulations often exhibit a significant latitudinal heat flux that can have a substantial influence on the flux that eventually emerges through the outer boundary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we are the first to address the issue of gravity darkening from the perspective of global , 3d simulations of convection in oblate stars .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : flux ] , the convective enthalpy flux @xmath348 in our simulations peaks in the upper convection zone ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : flux_balance-120 ] ) . both warm upflows and cool downflows serve to transport flux out of the star . however , this enthalpy flux is not uniform in latitude , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : fe_so ] which shows the zonally - averaged @xmath353 in cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 .",
    "this shows efficient heat transport through the convective envelope near the equatorial region in both cases .",
    "this is attributed to the banana cells that arise because of the influence of rotation on convection .",
    "the alignment of convective banana cells with the rotation axis allows for more efficient heat transport .",
    "we also find that more enthalpy flux flows through the polar regions in case @xmath147 than in case @xmath145 .",
    "this difference arises because of the thinner depth of the convection zone at high latitudes , which tends to increase the radial temperature and entropy gradient as discussed in section [ sec : flux ] .",
    "this in turn increases the buoyant driving , making the convection more vigorous .",
    "the greater vigor of polar convection in case @xmath147 is likely also associated with the decoupling of the polar and equatorial convection modes as discussed in section [ sec : patterns ] .",
    "the prominent vertical striping of the polar enthalpy flux apparent in figure [ fig : fe_so]@xmath331 is associated with strong mean flows as discussed in section [ sec : mean ] .",
    "the enthalpy flux is within the star but only the heat flux coming out at the surface can be observed . in our model",
    ", the heat flux passing through the outer surface of the star is carried by the diffusive entropy flux , @xmath356 .",
    "thus , this is the quantity to consider in order to assess the latitudinal dependence of the emergent flux , within the context of gravity darkening .",
    "figure [ fig : fu_so ] shows the comparison of latitudinal entropy flux @xmath351 at the outer surface simulated in cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the profiles predicted by @xcite and @xcite in figure [ fig : fu_so ] .",
    "there are two noteworthy results to be gleaned from figure [ fig : fu_so ] .",
    "first , a comparison between cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 clearly shows an enhanced polar heat flux in the latter case . the oblateness will tend to make the poles brighter , as in the standard gravity darkening paradigm @xcite .",
    "however , in stark contrast to the standard paradigm , case @xmath147 exhibits a secondary peak in the emergent heat flux at the equator .",
    "this is the second noteworthy result and , unlike the first , is somewhat unexpected .",
    "though the emergent flux is carried by @xmath356 , both of these results can be ultimately attributed to the nature of the deeper enthalpy flux @xmath353 illustrated in figure [ fig : fe_so ] .",
    "since @xmath353 must vanish at the surface due to the impenetrable boundary condition , there must be a convergence of the outward enthalpy flux just below the surface , which preferentially heats the fluid in the polar and equatorial regions .",
    "since the temperature is fixed at the outer surface , this heating increases the normal temperature and entropy gradients .",
    "in other words , the enhanced enthalpy flux @xmath353 in the polar and equatorial regions is converted into an emergent diffusive entropy flux @xmath356 .",
    "heat transport by global convective motions under the influence of rotation and stratification is not taken into account in the analysis of @xcite and @xcite . only global , 3d convection simulations",
    "can explicitly capture these effects .",
    "ours are the first such simulations and they are calling into question common assumptions . for example , since the imposed heat flux on the bottom boundary is uniform , a non - uniform heat flux across any equipotential surface @xmath45 necessarily implies a nonzero heat flux along @xmath45 surfaces somewhere deeper in the convection zone , provided that the simulation is equilibrated .",
    "this violates the assumptions made by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results imply that rapidly - rotating , oblate , lower - mass stars with convective envelopes might not have darker equators after all .",
    "however , there is a caveat to this conclusion that has to do with the parameter regimes that we have considered in our simulations .",
    "it is well known that banana cells are the linearly preferred instability modes for convection in rapidly - rotating spherical shells @xcite .",
    "thus , as the rayleigh number ra is increased beyond the critical value for convection to set in , the equatorial modes are excited first , causing the convective enthalpy flux to peak at the equator . as ra is increased further , the polar modes are excited .",
    "thus , the energy flux profiles for cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 shown in figures [ fig : fe_so ] and [ fig : fu_so ] , featuring prominent minima at mid latitudes , are commonly seen in global spherical convection simulatons at moderate rayleigh numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the much higher rayleigh numbers characteristic of real stars",
    ", these mid - latitude minima may fill in at least partially , making the emergent heat flux more uniform .",
    "thus , we may be overestimating the magnitude of the latitudinal variation . still , the enhanced brightness at the poles and equator are real physical effects , grounded in the physics of rotating convection .",
    "these are the regions where convective structures can align with the rotation axis , enhancing the efficiency of the convective energy transport .",
    "the simulations of @xcite in particular demonstrate another interesting effect ; the suppression of the equatorial heat transport by strong differential rotation .",
    "this occurs at high rayleigh numbers and moderate rotational influence ( ro @xmath379 ) , where the relative differential rotation @xmath380 is largest .",
    "the resulting differential rotation peaks strongly at the poles .",
    "if this were to occur in oblate stars , it could enhance the gravity darkening , making the equator relatively dim , as in the classical picture of von zeipel , though for different reasons .",
    "however , stars that are rotating rapidly enough to be oblate are likely to possess low rossby numbers ( ro @xmath152 ) , where the yadav et al simulations exhibit an enhanced heat flux at the equator .",
    "furthermore , oblateness and magnetism may prevent the rotational shear from becoming strong enough to suppress the equatorial heat transport ; dynamo simulations by yadav et al .  with the same parameters exhibit a mid - latitude minimum in the heat flux as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "more generally , rapidly - rotating stars are known to exhibit vigorous dynamo action which could influence the results reported here .",
    "in addition to altering the convective heat transport , magnetism can influence the latitudinal dependence of the heat flux through polar starspots and faculae .",
    "another relevant phenomenon that we have neglected is small - scale surface convection .",
    "the steep superadiabatic entropy and density stratification in the surface layers of late - type stars drives small - scale convective motions that can not be resolved in global models .",
    "familiar examples include solar granulation and supergranulation",
    ". these will tend to homogenize the outgoing heat flux , possibly mitigating any latitudinal variations that may be established deeper in the convection zone .",
    "further research is needed to establish how all of these effects contribute to the emergent flux in oblate , late - type stars .",
    "as mentioned previously , the results presented here should be regarded as a baseline for further study and certainly not the final word .",
    "some aspects of the differential rotation were discussed in section [ sec : dr1 ] , within the context of stellar observations , previous global convection simulations and previous models of oblate stars . here",
    "we look at the mean flows ( differential rotation and meridional circulation ) in more detail , considering the influence of oblateness on their spatial structure .",
    "we define mean flows as averages of the velocity field @xmath29 or the mass flux @xmath381 over longitude .",
    "longitudinal averages are denoted by angular brackets , e.g.  @xmath382 .",
    "the differential rotation ( in nhz ) is expressed in terms of the angular velocity as follows : @xmath383 we define thermal variations @xmath384 and @xmath385 by averaging over longitude and time and then subtracting the spherically - symmetric component in order to highlight variations relative to the mean stratification .",
    "the mean flows for cases @xmath147 and cases @xmath145 are shown in figure [ fig : mc_120 ] .    as mentioned in section [ sec : dr1 ] , the simulations considered here all have a solar - like differential rotation profile , with relatively fast rotation at the equator that decreases toward higher latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_120]@xmath13,@xmath386 ) .",
    "this is a common feature of convection simulations at low rossby number and is established by the convective angular momentum transport associated with banana cells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these rotation profiles are generally in thermal wind balance , maintained in part by baroclinic torques that offset the tendency for @xmath387 contours to align with the rotation axis in accordance with the taylor - proudman theorem .",
    "it is this thermal wind effect that is responsible for the poleward gradients that dominate the temperature and entropy profiles in figure [ fig : mc_120 ] , frames @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath388 , and @xmath389 .    however , superposed on this monotonic decrease of @xmath387 from equator to pole , case @xmath147 exhibits a striking series of alternating zonal jets in both polar regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_120]@xmath13 ) .",
    "these are associated with a similar series of strong meridional circulation cells that can be seen prominently in the latitudinal mass flux plot of figure [ fig : mc_120]@xmath162 .",
    "though the zonal jets are confined to the upper convection zone , the meridional cells extend throughout the convection zone , with a significant poleward tilt from bottom to top .",
    "similar features are also present in cases @xmath187 and @xmath182 ( not shown ) .    the faint thermal signature in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_120]@xmath331,@xmath332 suggests that these are axisymmetric convection cells , with the zonal jets arising from the coriolis - induced deflection of meridional flows toward and away from the rotation axis near the outer surface .",
    "this thermal signature is also seen in the enthalpy flux of figure [ fig : fe_so]@xmath331 and in the emergent flux of figure [ fig : fu_so ] ( as the high - latitude wiggles ) .",
    "the presence of these convective cells near the polar regions in case @xmath147 is likely due in part to the larger entropy gradient since the polar convection zone depth is relatively small compared to the equatorial depth ( see section [ sec : flux ] ) . in any case",
    ", they appear to be induced by the oblateness .    at lower latitudes , outside the tangent cylinder , the meridional flow in both cases @xmath145 and @xmath147 exhibits a multiple - cell structure characterized by alternating regions of northward and southward mass flux ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mc_120]@xmath162,@xmath390 ) .",
    "this too is a common feature in global convection simulations and is attributed to the nature of the convective reynolds stress induced by banana cells @xcite .    to study the temporal evolution of the high - latitude zonal jets in case @xmath147 , we have plotted in figure [ fig : df_o120 ] a latitude - time map of @xmath387 in the vicinity of the north pole ( latitudes @xmath391 ) .",
    "recall that the rotation period in this case is about 0.23 days ( a factor of 120 less than the sun ) , so the time period covered in the plot spans over 100 rotation periods ( and over 20 convective turnover times ) .",
    "some of the zonal jets persist for this entire interval , though they meander in latitude .",
    "each jet is about 4 - 5@xmath392 wide .",
    "we have preformed the first global 3d hydrodynamic simulations of convection in the oblate envelopes of rapidly - rotating solar - type stars using the recently introduced compressible high - order unstructured spectral difference ( chorus ) code ( wlm15 ) .",
    "the chorus code employs unstructured grids , giving it the capability to deal with oblate spheroidal shell geometries .",
    "this unique tool allows us to investigate the influence of the oblateness on the convection and mean flows , including heat transport , differential rotation , and the thermal structure of the convective envelope .",
    "we have found that the influence of rotation and oblateness leads to an enhancement of the emerging heat flux in the polar and equatorial regions .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the conventional concept of gravity darkening and has important observational implications ; oblate , low - mass stars with convective envelopes may not exhibit gravity darkening in the same way that higher - mass stars do . in particular , the minimum suface brightness might occur at mid - latitudes rather than at the equator .",
    "the enhancement of the polar heat flux due to oblateness arises for essentially the same reason as in classical gravity darkening arguments ; the stronger effective gravity relative to lower latitudes enhances thermal gradients ( see section [ sec : flux ] ) .",
    "this makes the convection more vigorous .",
    "however , the secondary peak in the emergent heat flux at the equator arises from physical effects that are not taken into account in the classical models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "oblate stars are rapidly - rotating by nature , implying strong rotational constraints on the convective motions ( low rossby numbers ) . in these parameter regimes ,",
    "the convection in the equatorial region ( outside the tangent cylinder ) is dominated by banana cells , columnar convective modes aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "these banana cells can transport heat more efficiently than at mid - latitudes .    in short , the convective heat transport peaks at the poles and at the equator because this is where the convective structures can most easily organize themselves to mitigate the strong rotational constraints : vertical plumes at high latitudes and banana cells at low latitudes . furthermore , though banana cells are essentially laminar flow features , this fundamental argument also extends to more turbulent parameter regimes ( higher rayleigh and reynolds numbers ) .",
    "for example , in the high - resolution boussinesq simulations of @xcite , the convective columns break up into vortex sheets as the diffusion is decreased .",
    "however , these vortex sheets are still aligned with the rotation axis outside the tangent cylinder and would still be expected to yield an enhancement of the equatorial heat flux .",
    "thus , we expect that the general latitudinal dependence of the emergent heat flux in oblate solar - type stars to be similar to that found here , with maxima at the poles and equator . however ,",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : darkening ] , we may be overestimating the magnitude of the variation , which here is on the order of 40% ( see figure [ fig : fu_so ] ) .",
    "the latitudinal dependence of the emergent heat flux is a symptom of the more general tendency for convection in rapidly - rotating spherical or spheroidal shells to separate into distinct polar and equatorial modes , inside and outside the tangent cylinder .",
    "we find that the oblateness enhances this dichotomy , causing the polar regions to largely decouple from the equatorial regions ( figs .",
    "[ fig : con_pattern ] , [ fig : vn_so ] ) . however , other aspects of the convective structure such as the power spectrum and the width of banana cells , are insensitive to the oblateness .",
    "another notable result from our simulations is the presence of banded zonal jets at high latitudes ( section [ sec : mean ] ) .",
    "remarkably , these only occur in the oblate simulations , so they are clearly induced by the oblateness .",
    "they appear to be due to narrow , axisymmetric convective modes that are approximately aligned with the rotation axis but significantly tilted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_120 ] ) .",
    "each jet is about 4 - 5@xmath392 wide and many persist for over 100 rotation periods , though they meander in latitude ( figure [ fig : df_o120 ] ) .",
    "it is unclear whether or not these jets would persist in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "all stars are ionized and , given the extreme parameter regimes , all stellar convection zones are expected to undergo vigorous dynamo action .",
    "dynamo - generated magnetic fields might suppress the polar jets directly by means of magnetic tension or indirectly by inhibiting the intrinsic self - organization processes of rapidly - rotating hydrodynamic turbulence ( e.g.  the inverse cascade of kinetic energy and the anisotropic suppression of this cascade that gives rise to the rhines scale ) .",
    "however , these jets do not appear to arise from the inverse cascade of smaller - scale vorticies . whether or not they occur in the presence of magnetism",
    "is a topic for future work . though chorus does not currently have the capability to solve the full set of mhd equations , we intend to implement this capability in the future .",
    "the amplitude of the differential rotation is not very sensitive to either the rotation rate or the oblateness .",
    "if we decrease @xmath14 and @xmath42 as we increase the rotation rate in order to mainin a roughly constant supercriticality , we find that the differential rotation scales as @xmath393 .",
    "this result is for spherical ( non - oblate ) simulations and is qualitatively consistent with previous global convection simulations and stellar observations ( section [ sec : dr1 ] ) . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath42 are held constant , we find no clear scaling of @xmath0 versus @xmath326 ( fig .  [ fig : delta_omega ] ) .",
    "however , the fraction of the total kinetic energy contained in the differential rotation , drke / ke , does increase monotonically in these same spherical simulations as @xmath326 is increased from 0.526 in case @xmath144 to 0.681 to case @xmath145 ( table [ tab : diagnostics ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the oblateness tends to suppress this increase of drke / ke with @xmath326 .",
    "for the oblate series of simulations , @xmath146 through @xmath147 , the drke / ke ratio saturates at a maximum value of 0.61 for @xmath344 ( table [ tab : diagnostics ] ) . this trend is also visible in the surface differential rotation @xmath0 , which decreases slightly beyond about @xmath394 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_omega ] ) .",
    "the fractional differential rotation @xmath395 decreases with increasing rotation for both the spherical and the oblate stars .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the differential rotation is likely to be too weak to have a significant effect on the oblateness ( appendix [ appen : a ] ) .",
    "we acknowledge that our simulations certainly have their limitations , the most important being the relatively laminar parameter regimes and the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "however , as the first simulations of their kind , we regard these as a baseline for future work . we have identified interesting features that warrant further study , such as a departure from the classical gravity darkening paradigm for late - type stars and the presence of polar jets induced by oblateness . and , we have demonstrated some of the potential of the new chorus code , which promises to be a unique and powerful tool for the ongoing investigation of stellar and planetary convection .",

    "a fully self - consistent simulation would properly capture the nonlinear interaction between the convection , the differential rotation , and the oblateness , allowing the star to deform in response to the differential rotation that the convection establishes .",
    "however , this poses significant computational challenges and we show in this appendix that even if we were to overcome these challenges , it would be unlikely to change our results .    in this appendix",
    "we investigate the effect of differential rotation on the oblateness of rotating stars in a simple model . in this model , the desired oblate spheroidal shell",
    "is obtained by deforming a spherical shell with the uniformly rotating rate @xmath16 while the mass and angular momentum in the @xmath56 direction is kept unchanged .",
    "we neglect convection and meridional circulation in our analysis ; the only motion is the differential rotation .",
    "furthermore , to make the problem more analytically tractable , we assume that the differential rotation follows a conservative rotation law , @xmath396 where @xmath397 is the cylindrical radius , so the centrifugal force can be represented as the gradient of a potential .    the rotation profile in the oblate spheroidal shell is assumed to be a linear function of @xmath398 ; @xmath399 where @xmath400 is the outer radius of the original spherical shell , @xmath401 is the fractional differential rotation and @xmath402 is a coefficient that is adjusted to conserve angular momentum as described below .",
    "thus , the effective gravitational potential is @xmath403 we then compute the structure of the oblate spheroidal shell as described in section [ sec : mp ] , using this potential instead of equation ( [ eqn : potential ] ) .    during the deformation from the spherical shell to the oblate spheroidal shell with the desired linear rotation profile ,",

    "for example , for no differential rotation ( @xmath411 ) , the larger moment of inertia associated with the oblate shell requires @xmath412 rad s@xmath96 = 105 @xmath413 to achieve the same angular momentum as a spherical shell rotating at a rate of @xmath414 . for @xmath415",

    "the fractional differential rotation can then be defined as @xmath421 . for @xmath422",
    "this gives a fractional differential rotation of 0.5 .",
    "thus , according to table [ tab : oblateness ] , varying the fractional differential rotation from 0 ( @xmath411 ) to 0.5 ( @xmath422 ) only changes the oblateness by about 0.22% .",
    "this can be compared with the fractional differential rotation @xmath395 achieved in our simulations , as shown in figure [ fig : delta_omega ] . as shown there",

    "<S> we present the first global 3d simulations of thermal convection in the oblate envelopes of rapidly - rotating solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> this has been achieved by exploiting the capabilities of the new compressible high - order unstructured spectral difference ( chorus ) code . </S>",
    "<S> we consider rotation rates up to 85% of the critical ( breakup ) rotation rate , which yields an equatorial radius that is up to 17% larger than the polar radius . </S>",
    "<S> this substantial oblateness enhances the disparity between polar and equatorial modes of convection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the convection redistributes the heat flux emitted from the outer surface , leading to an enhancement of the heat flux in the polar and equatorial regions . </S>",
    "<S> this finding implies that lower - mass stars with convective envelopes may not have darker equators as predicted by classical gravity darkening arguments . </S>",
    "<S> the vigorous high - latitude convection also establishes elongated axisymmetric circulation cells and zonal jets in the polar regions . </S>",
    "<S> though the overall amplitude of the surface differential rotation , @xmath0 , is insensitive to the oblateness , the oblateness does limit the fractional kinetic energy contained in the differential rotation to no more than 61% . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that this level of differential rotation is not enough to have a significant impact on the oblateness of the star . </S>"
