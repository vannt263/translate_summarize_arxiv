    "oscillations induced by noise are observed in many nonlinear systems with dissipation including neural networks , lasers , chemical reactions , biomembranes , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) . at present , three different types of systems are being recognized that demonstrate noise - induced oscillations : bistable systems @xcite , systems close to andronov - hopf bifurcation @xcite , and excitable systems @xcite .",
    "much effort has been put into the development of the analytic description of excitable systems .",
    "the approach of the renewal theory @xcite was successfully adopted to describe the real excitable systems with continuous dynamics by a two - state @xcite , or by a three - state @xcite discontinuous stochastic process . in the frames of the renewal theory ,",
    "it is assumed that the system is allowed to be only in a finite number of states , and the noise makes the system switch between the states in a random manner .",
    "the time the system spends in a given state before undergoing the next transition is called residence time in this state . for the validity of the renewal theory",
    "it is crucial that the distribution function of the residence time in a given state does not change in time .",
    "therefore , in the case of an @xmath1-state system , its entire dynamics is determined by @xmath1 distribution densities of the residence times , also known as residence time densities ( rtds ) . for the fitzhugh - nagumo system the rtds were explicitly calculated in @xcite using the fokker - planck equation approach suggested in @xcite .",
    "phenomenological three - state model of the excitable system with the arbitrary rtds was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when a delay term is introduced into an excitable system , and the random process in it becomes non - markovian .",
    "this problem arises for example in relation to the problem of controlling noise - induced motion .",
    "usually noise - induced oscillations possess a certain timescale that is dependent on the parameters of the applied noise , e.g. its intensity .",
    "one possible way to define this timescale for an excitable system is to estimate the power spectrum that would normally contain one or more peaks , and to take the inverse of the frequency of the highest peak to be the main period of oscillations . in @xcite",
    "the idea was introduced to control the properties of oscillations induced merely by external noise by applying time - delayed feedback force @xmath2 in the pyragas form @xcite : @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is time delay and @xmath4 is the feedback strength .",
    "it has been shown that the timescale and the coherence of noise - induced oscillations can be changed by adjusting solely the delay time in the controlling force . moreover ,",
    "an almost piecewise - linear dependence of the main period on the delay time was revealed .",
    "remarkably , a similar behaviour of the main period was found in systems with time - delayed feedback that were either excitable , or close to andronov - hopf bifurcation @xcite . for a van der pol oscillator",
    "this phenomenon was explained by means of computation of the power spectrum of oscillations analytically : by using either linearization @xcite , or mean - filed approximation @xcite .    the theory of the excitable systems with time delay is still missing . some progress was made in @xcite , where the impact of the delayed feedback on the current dynamics of the system was considered in the mean field approximation .",
    "here we propose an alternative approach based on the analysis of renewal processes with history - dependent rtds .",
    "as mentioned above , the renewal theory can only be applied in the case when the rtds _ do not change in time_. this condition is obviously violated for the processes with time delay , in which rtds are dependent on history .    in order to overcome this problem , we introduce _ equilibrium _ rtds by averaging over all possible histories .",
    "this approach is somewhat similar to the one suggested in @xcite for calculating the rtd in the case of stochastic resonance , where the noise - induced switchings between the two potential wells are considered in the presence of a weak periodic perturbation .",
    "namely , in @xcite the unknown rtd is obtained by averaging the known distribution of escape times ( time it takes to escape from a certain well ) over the known probability that the system spends a certain amount of time in the left well before entering the right well .",
    "in contrast to this , we show that in the case of _ history - dependent _ renewal process , the equilibrium rtds are given by the solution of an integral equation .",
    "this equation is derived for an arbitrary , and solved analytically for a moderate , delay time .    in order to compare the analytic results of the modified renewal theory with the numerical results for an excitable system , we design an excitable system from a bistable system with a non - symmetric potential and with a time delay , following the idea of the delay - induced excitability proposed in @xcite . to this system",
    "we add the controlling force @xmath2 as above .",
    "the parameters of the two - state model used for analytics are matched to the parameters of the bistable system via the kramers formula for the transition rates @xcite .",
    "we employ the hybrid approach by combining the renewal theory results with the equilibrium rtds of the history - dependent process in order to approximate the power spectrum of the noise - induced oscillations .",
    "incoherence maximization due to delay is demonstrated for positive feedback strength @xmath4 only .",
    "before describing the way to construct an excitable system from a bistable system with delay following @xcite , we need to explain the concept of excitability .",
    "a popular toy model of an excitable system is a fitzhugh - nagumo system @xmath5 where @xmath6 describes random fluctuations with gaussian distribution , zero mean and unity variance .",
    "the null - clines of this system , which are the curves defined by @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath8@xmath9 ( assuming that @xmath11@xmath8@xmath9 ) are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig0 ] ) , and no oscillatory dynamics without noise ( @xmath11@xmath8@xmath9 ) . when gaussian noise is applied ( @xmath11@xmath16@xmath9 ) , the behavior of the system changes drastically .",

[ fig0 ] ) : this motion is smeared by noise , but its velocity is almost unaffected by the latter , at least in average .",
    "as soon as the phase point reaches the top of the right - hand parabola branch , the vector flow swiftly carries it towards the left - hand branch ( upper dotted line in fig .",

    "second , the durations @xmath24 and @xmath22 of the excursion and of the refractory stages can be approximately regarded as independent of noise and constant in any event of a large excursion in the phase space , while the duration @xmath19 of the waiting stage is completely determined by noise .",
