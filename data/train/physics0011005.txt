    "the use of evanescent waves ( ew ) as a tool to manipulate the motion of neutral atoms has been proposed by cook and hill @xcite . since then",
    ", ew mirrors have become an important tool in atom optics @xcite .",
    "they have been demonstrated for atomic beams at grazing incidence @xcite and for ultracold atoms at normal incidence @xcite . in many experiments",
    "the scattering of ew photons was undesirable because it makes the mirror incoherent .    however , an ew mirror is also a promising tool for efficient loading of low - dimensional optical atom traps in the vicinity of the dielectric surface @xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "spontaneous optical transitions play a crucial role in providing dissipation @xcite . since inelastic bouncing may increase the atomic phase - space density",
    ", this may open a route towards quantum degenerate gases , which does not use evaporative cooling .",
    "thus one may hope to achieve `` atom lasers '' @xcite which are open , driven systems out of thermal equilibrium , similar to optical lasers @xcite .",
    "it is this application of ew mirrors which drives our interest in experimental control of the photon scattering of bouncing atoms .    in a first experiment involving the scattering of evanescent photons",
    "we have observed directly for the first time the radiation pressure exerted by evanescent waves on cold atoms @xcite . in a second experiment",
    "we directly observe clouds of atoms which bounce inelastically by changing their hyperfine ground state .",
    "our experiments are performed in a vapor cell .",
    "approximately @xmath1 atoms of @xmath0rb are loaded out of the background vapor into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and are subsequently cooled to 10  @xmath2k using polarization gradient cooling ( optical molasses ) .",
    "the cold atom cloud is released in the @xmath3 ground state . after a free fall of 6.6  mm",
    "the atoms reach the horizontal surface of a right - angle bk7 prism ( refractive index @xmath4 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setupfigure](a ) .",
    "the ew beam emerges from a single - mode optical fiber , is collimated and directed into the prism through a relay telescope , see fig .  [",
    "fig : setupfigure](b ) .",
    "the angle of incidence @xmath5 is controlled by the vertical displacement @xmath6 of the first lens @xmath7 .",
    "the second lens @xmath8 images the beam to a _ fixed _ spot at the prism surface .",
    "a displacement @xmath6 changes the angle by @xmath9 .",
    "the beam has a minimum waist of @xmath10 m at the surface ( @xmath11 intensity radius ) and a nearly diffraction limited divergence half - angle of @xmath12  mrad .    for the ew",
    ", an injection - locked single mode laser diode provides up to 28  mw of optical power behind the fiber .",
    "it is seeded by an external grating stabilized diode laser , locked to the @xmath0rb hyperfine transition @xmath13 of the @xmath14 line .",
    "the detuning with respect to this transition determines the optical potential for atoms released from the mot in the @xmath3 ground state .",
    "the ew field is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the vacuum wave number .",
    "the optical dipole potential for a two - level atom can be written as @xmath19 . in the limit of large detuning , @xmath20 , and low saturation , @xmath21 ,",
    "the maximum potential at the surface is @xmath22/2 , with a saturation parameter @xmath23 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath24 is the intensity of the incident beam inside the prism , @xmath25  mw/@xmath26 is the saturation intensity for rubidium and @xmath27mhz is the natural linewidth .",
    "the factor @xmath28 ranges from 5.4  6.0 ( 2.5  2.65 ) for a tm ( te ) polarized ew @xcite .",
    "the detuning of the laser frequency @xmath29 with respect to the atomic transition frequency @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "thus a `` blue '' detuning ( @xmath32 ) yields an exponential potential barrier for incoming atoms .",
    "a classical turning point exists if the barrier height exceeds the kinetic energy @xmath33 of an incident atom .    in reality , the barrier height is determined not only by the dipole potential .",
    "the attractive van der waals potential near the surface , @xmath34 lowers the maximum potential and thus decreases the surface area on which atoms can bounce @xcite .",
    "gravity can usually be neglected on the length scale of the ew decay length .",
    "we have measured the fraction of bouncing atoms using a weak resonant probe beam , inserted between the mot position and the surface .",
    "time - of - flight signals were recorded on a photodiode and the integrated absorption signal was measured for both falling and bouncing atoms .",
    "the extracted fractions of bouncing atoms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewfrac ] , as a function of the strength of the optical potential @xmath35 .",
    "the logarithmic dependence is a consequence of the gaussian beam profile of the ew .",
    "also shown are two calculations of the bouncing fraction using no adjustable parameters , ( _ i _ ) assuming a purely optical potential ( dashed line ) , and ( _ ii _ ) taking into account also the van der waals surface attraction ( solid line ) .",
    "the latter clearly yields much better agreement .",
    "similar measurements have previously been performed by landragin _",
    "the evanescent wavevector @xmath36 contains a real ( propagating ) component along the surface .",
    "it has been predicted already by roosen and imbert @xcite that therefore an evanescent wave should exert radiation pressure parallel to the surface .",
    "a similar scattering force has been observed for micrometer - sized dielectric spheres @xcite .",
    "the photon scattering rate of a two - level atom in steady state at low saturation is @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "an atom bouncing on an ew mirror sees a time dependent saturation parameter @xmath38 . assuming that the excited state population follows adiabatically",
    ", we can integrate the scattering rate along an atom s trajectory to get the number of scattered photons , @xmath39 .",
    "for a purely optical potential this leads to an analytical solution : @xmath40 note that @xmath41 is independent of @xmath35 , as a consequence of the exponential shape of the potential .",
    "we have observed this evanescent - wave radiation pressure directly by imaging the bouncing atom clouds @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence induced by a 0.5  ms pulse of resonant probe light was imaged onto a digital frame - transfer ccd camera .",
    "a repumping beam , tuned to the @xmath42 transition of the @xmath43 line ( 795  nm ) , was used to counteract optical pumping to the @xmath44 ground state by the probe .",
    "we measure the trajectories of bouncing atoms by taking a sequence of images with incremental time delays . a typical series with increments of 10  ms is shown in fig .  [ fig : timesequence ] .",
    "a new sample was prepared for each shot ; each image was averaged over 10 shots . in the lower half of the figure we see the atom cloud bouncing up slightly sideways .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the horizontal velocity change during the bounce is extracted from a sequence of images . in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoils ] , we show how this velocity kick depends on the laser detuning @xmath45 and on the ew decay length @xmath46 , by varying the angle @xmath5 . the velocity kick has been expressed in units of the ew photon recoil , @xmath47 , with @xmath48  mm / s . in fig.[fig : recoils](a ) , the detuning is varied from 188  1400  mhz ( 31  233  @xmath49 ) .",
    "two sets of data are shown , taken for two different ew decay lengths @xmath50 m and @xmath51 m . we find that @xmath52 , as expected .",
    "the predictions based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyticalsolution ] ) are indicated in the figure ( solid lines ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoils](b ) , the detuning was kept fixed at @xmath53 and the angle of incidence varied from 0.9  24.0  mrad above the critical angle .",
    "this leads to a variation of decay length @xmath54 from 2.8  0.53  @xmath2 m . here",
    "also , we find a linear dependence on @xmath54 . clearly , a steep optical potential , i.e. a small decay length , causes less radiation pressure than a shallow potential .",
    "a linear fit to the data for @xmath55 m , extrapolates to an offset of approximately 3 photon recoils in the limit @xmath56 [ thin solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoils](b ) ] .",
    "we attribute this offset to diffusely scattered ew light due to roughness of the prism surface which propagates into the vacuum",
    ". preferential light scattering in the direction of the ew propagation can be explained if the power spectrum of the surface roughness is narrow compared to @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the effect of surface roughness has previously been observed as a broadening of bouncing atom clouds by the roughness of the _ dipole potential _ @xcite . in our case",
    ", we observe a change in center of mass motion of the clouds due to an increase in the _ spontaneous scattering force_. such a contribution to the radiation pressure due to surface roughness vanishes in the limit of large detuning @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we find no significant offset in fig .",
    "[ fig : recoils](a ) .",
    "= 9.0 cm    we have also verified that there is no significant dependence on the power of the ew , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyticalsolution ] ) . only a slight increase with ew power",
    "is observed , which may again be due to diffusely scattered light .",
    "the optical power mainly determines the effective mirror surface and thus the fraction of bouncing atoms .",
    "this is also visible in the horizontal width of bouncing clouds .",
    "we find a significant correction due to the excited state manifold @xmath58 of @xmath0rb .",
    "besides @xmath59 , also @xmath60 contribute to the mirror potential , whereas they do not much affect the scattering rate .",
    "for an ew detuning of @xmath61 , this reduces the number of scattered photons by typically @xmath62 compared to a two - level atom , when we average over the contributions from different magnetic sublevels ( dashed lines ) .",
    "if the mirror laser is tuned to an open transition , photon scattering can lead to a spontaneous raman transition to the other hyperfine ground state .",
    "the atom will then leave the surface on a different potential curve from when it approached the surface . hence , the kinetic energy after the bounce will in general be different from that before the bounce .",
    "we performed experiments where the ew laser was tuned in the blue wing of the @xmath42 transition of the @xmath14 line of @xmath0rb , with a detuning @xmath63 , with @xmath64  ghz the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "atoms in @xmath3 see the ew mirror with a detuning which is larger by a factor of approximately @xmath65 and therefore see a much weaker potential .",
    "thus they leave the surface with a reduced kinetic energy . repeating this procedure leads to so - called `` evanescent - wave cooling '' @xcite .",
    "we observe the inelastically bouncing atoms directly by imaging the absorption of a weak resonant probe pulse onto a digital ccd camera . in fig .",
    "[ fig : inelastic ] we show a typical image , taken when the slowest atoms have reached their upper turning point .",
    "the observed clouds are highly asymmetric , with a dense peak at the lower edge of the cloud and a tail of faster atoms extending upward .",
    "the dense peak contains the atoms that made the raman transition near the turning point , because here they move slowly in a relatively high light intensity .",
    "the tail contains faster atoms , which have made the raman transition while falling down to , or bouncing up from the surface .",
    "the density distribution in the vertical direction agrees well with a calculation where the atoms are modeled as point particles moving on an exponential potential curve .",
    "the result of the inelastic bouncing experiment shows the preference for making a spontaneous raman transition near the turning point of the bounce .",
    "this is of great importance for our ongoing experiments which are aimed at trapping the cold atoms near the turning point , in a low - dimensional optical trap . although the present experiment showed a relatively high density at the lowest possible bouncing velocity , it is unlikely that the phase - space density has been increased .",
    "it remains to be investigated under what conditions such an increase can be obtained and by how much .",
    "the scattering of evanescent photons is an essential ingredient in our experiment toward loading low - dimensional optical traps . at the same time , once loaded into the trap , we wish the atoms to scatter at a very low rate . in order to meet these conflicting requirements",
    "our present experiments are aimed at trapping the atoms in a so - called dark state which no longer interacts with the evanescent wave .",
    "this requires the use of circularly polarized evanescent waves .",
    "this procedure should lead to an ultracold low - dimensional gas and may ultimately yield an all - optical road to quantum - degeneracy and an atom laser .",
