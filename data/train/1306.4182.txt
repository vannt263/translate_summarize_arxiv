    "the first qcdsr calculation for a possible anti - charmed pentaquark was done in ref .",
    "the authors have found a mass around @xmath18 , supposing that the anti - charmed pentaquark can be described by a current with two - light diquarks and one anti - charm quark . since for a charmed @xmath14 pentaquark",
    "one needs a light diquark , a heavy - light diquark and a light antiquark to describe it , and since light diquarks are supposed to be very bound states @xcite and heavy - light diquarks less bound @xcite , we expect the mass of the charmed pentaquark to be bigger than the mass of the anti - charmed pentaquark and , therefore , compatible with the observed @xmath0 enhancement .",

    "it is worth mentioning that , for both currents @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we have found a substantial @xmath31-instability in the @xmath34 sum rule evaluation .",

    "[ figj0]b ) , we also see that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution only for values @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we can fix the borel window as : @xmath42 . from eq .",
    "( [ eqmass ] ) , we can estimate the ground state mass , which is shown , as a function of @xmath31 , in fig .",

    "we conclude that there is a very good @xmath31-stability in the determined borel window , which is indicated through the parenthesis .",
    "varying the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath43 , and other parameters as indicated in table [ tabparam ] , we get @xmath44    this mass is surprisingly compatible with one of the unexplained structures observed by babar collaboration @xcite at @xmath45 . therefore , from a sum rule point of view , such a @xmath23 pentaquark state with a internal structure composed by a scalar light - diquark and a pseudoscalar heavy - light - diquark could be a good candidate to explain the @xmath10 enhancement .    for completeness , we evaluate the @xmath36 sum rule for the current @xmath33 . we would naively expect to obtain a mass in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ j0mass ] ) . the comparison between the two sum rules",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figj0rmxrq ] , considering the borel range @xmath46 and @xmath38 .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath37 sum rule presents a better @xmath31-stability than @xmath36 .",
    "besides , the borel window for the @xmath36 sum rule lies on the range @xmath47 which does not contain @xmath31-stability .",
    "thus , we conclude that the results extracted from the @xmath36 can be ruled out , while the @xmath37 provides a more reliable sum rule calculation and the mass found in eq .",
    "( [ j0mass ] ) must be settled as the optimized estimation for the @xmath23 pentaquark mass .      in the case of the current @xmath32",
    ", we also retain only the results from the @xmath37 sum rule , according to the previous analysis .",

    ", we can fix the borel window as : @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",
    "as one can see , from the fig .",
    "[ figj1 ] c ) , we obtain @xmath31-stability only for a narrow borel window . however , it is still possible to extract reliable results from this sum rule . varying the continuum threshold in the range @xmath50 , and the other parameters as indicated in table [ tabparam ] , we get @xmath51 this value for the mass is compatible with the first signal observed in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath0 state also can be described by a pentaquark containing two scalar diquarks in its internal structure .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that we get a smaller mass with the current with two scalar diquarks , when compared with the current with one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquarks .",
    "although we have one light and one light - heavy diquarks , our results follow the phenomenology obtained by shuryak @xcite for the light diquarks .",
    "+    it is interesting to compare our results with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the author evaluates the sum rule for the @xmath53 molecule , since such a molecular current can be rewritten in terms of a sum over pentaquark type currents , by using fierz transformations @xcite .",
    "indeed , the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite is in agreement with our result in eq .",
    "( [ j1mass ] ) , which was obtained with the current in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) . however , there are some points in the analysis done in ref",
    ".  @xcite that deserve consideration . in particular , to obtain a mass compatible with the 3.25 gev enhancement observed by babar , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite , had to release the criteria of pole dominance and the usual good ope convergence .",
    "in doing so , the analysis inevitably led to a misleading definition of the borel window , fixed as @xmath54 for the @xmath53 molecule .",
    "besides , one can see that there is also no @xmath31-stability in such borel window .",
    "therefore , we believe that if the author of ref .  @xcite had imposed pole dominance , good ope convergence and borel stability in his analysis he would have obtained a bigger value for the mass of the @xmath53 current .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a qcdsr calculation for the two - point function of two possible pentaquark states , whose internal structure is composed of two scalar diquarks , for @xmath20 , and a scalar light - diquark plus a pseudoscalar heavy - light - diquark , for @xmath23 . as expected from phenomenology @xcite , we get a smaller mass with the current @xmath32 containing two scalar diquarks , in comparison with the current @xmath33 containing one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquarks .",
    "also , we get a bigger mass for the @xmath23 pentaquark state when comparing with the one studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors considered for the @xmath24 state a current with two - light diquarks and one anti - charm quark .",
    "indeed , this result is in agreement with the expectation that heavy - light diquarks are less bound than light diquarks @xcite .",
    "our findings strongly suggest that at least two enhancements observed by babar collaboration , with a peak at @xmath52 and @xmath55 , decaying into @xmath56 , could be understood as being such pentaquarks .",
    "we would like to thank apctp for sponsoring the workshop on hadron physics at rhic. the discussions during the workshop have led the authors to collaborate on this subject .",
    "this work has been partly supported by fapesp and cnpq - brazil , by the korea research foundation krf-2011 - 0020333 and krf-2011 - 0030621 and by the german bmbf grant 06bo108i .",
    "the spectral densities expressions for the charmed neutral pentaquarks , @xmath20 and @xmath23 , described by the currents in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) and ( [ field2 ] ) respectively , have been calculated up to dimension-10 condensates , at leading order in @xmath1 . to keep the heavy quark mass finite",
    ", we use the momentum - space expression for the heavy quark propagator .",
    "we calculate the light quark part of the correlation function in the coordinate - space , and we use the schwinger parameters to evaluate the heavy quark part of the correlator . to evaluate the @xmath57 integration in eq .",
    "( [ 2po ] ) , we use again the schwinger parameters , after a wick rotation .",
