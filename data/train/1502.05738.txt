    "porphyrins are popular molecules in living organisms . their ability to bind the transition metals",
    "is utilized in biological processes significant for the human - blood functions - employing fe in heme .",
    "it is also responsible for the photosynthesis in plants - building a complex with mg , namely chlorofile.@xcite the oxo - metal - porphyrins , such as oxotitanium porphyrin ( p - tio ) , can be used for solar - activated water splitting - what has been theoretically proposed to occur due to low - lying ligand - to - metal intramolecular charge - transfer states@xcite and recently experimentally confirmed.@xcite    porphyrins or phthalocyanines can be assembled at metals@xcite and other surfaces@xcite forming 2d networks.@xcite in turn , the surfaces or additional ligands change the charge state of the transition metal bound to porphyrins with respect to the bare 2d network .",
    "this is because different valence states of a metal , metal - oxygen moiety , or metal - li complex lay closely in the energy.@xcite not only the single layers of the metal - organic networks exist , also the double- and triple - decker layers of metal - phthalocyanines have been grown , on both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic substrates.@xcite    for catalytic reactions with the intramolecular charge transfer , such as the water splitting , the intermolecular connections must be very weakly conducting ( non - covalent ) ; for example the hydrogen bridges ( o - h ... o ) . for the spintronic applications , on the other hand , these connections should be conducting .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen the acethylene bridges .",
    "various choices of the intermolecular - bridging type were examined experimentally for the energy transfer rates,@xcite and a role of the frontier molecular - orbitals was theoretically studied for the donor - acceptor dimers.@xcite    a new branch of material science grows on top of potential utilization of the 2d organic layers@xcite in the electronic devices ; as well as the magnetic nanoparticles deposited on various substrates.@xcite selective incorporation of metal atoms into organic templates enables wide functionalization of the layers,@xcite hence many applications are plausible .",
    "the 4-fold symmetry of porphyrins and phthalocyanines with the transition metals makes their networks similar to the heusler compounds , which are very strong magnets.@xcite there are review articles on the spintronic topics in the 2d networks.@xcite the photovoltaic thin films based on the metal - phthalocyanine 2d networks - organized in the aa - stacking order - conduct the current very well in the columnar direction.@xcite similar effect should be observed in metal - porphyrins . for technological reasons ,",
    "the conductive properties of the single metal - porphyrin molecules between the electrodes,@xcite and the 1d metal - porphyrin chains@xcite were also investigated .",
    "recently , high - mobility field - effect transistors have been constructed by building the abab - type stacking of the phthalocyanine - vo and -tio layers.@xcite    in this work , we focus on the covalent 2d networks of porphyrins with all @xmath0-row transition metals and tmo , bridged with the acetylene moiety .",
    "the model structures of our systems are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "we want to obtain a material with strong and long - range magnetic - exchange interactions .",
    "thus the covalent intermolecular connection was chosen , since it has been found that the covalent inorganic materials - as hosts for the transition metal impurities - are strongly magnetically coupled for long distances.@xcite        interestingly , another molecular system - similar to that studied in this work , but assembled at cu and containing fe - was demonstrated to switch the easy magnetization - direction after adding the oxygen.@xcite we report the ferrimagnetism , similar to that theoretically predicted by other authors in porphyrins with mn and connected by 4-bromophenyl to form 1d magnetic chains.@xcite this effect can be mapped on the atomic scale by the measurement of magnetic resonance spectra at gigahertz frequencies using x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd).@xcite",
    "we performed the density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations using the quantum espresso ( qe ) suite of codes,@xcite which employs the plane - wave basis set and the pseudopotentials to describe the core electrons .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional was chosen for the gradient corrected perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization.@xcite the ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used with the energy cutoffs 35 ry and 400 ry for the plane - waves and the density , respectively .",
    "the monkhorst - pack uniform k - mesh in the brillouin zone ( bz ) has been set to @xmath1 , and the fermi - surface energy broadening parameter 0.02 ry was chosen for a better convergence .",
    "the vacuum separation between the periodic slabs was 40  .",
    "the pseudopotentials for the atoms from sc to co were modeled with the semi - core states ( 3s and 3p ) included in the valence band , in contrast , the cu and zn valence shells were constructed without the deeper states .",
    "we started with the geometry optimization of a single molecule , namely porphyrin - ti , using the b3lyp method which is equivalent to the dft scheme of the blyp - type with 20@xmath2 of the exact exchange ( exx).@xcite this step was done with the quantum chemistry package turbomole,@xcite which represents the wavefuntions in the gaussian basis set ; we used the correlation - consistent valence double - zeta atomic basis set with polarization functions for all atoms ( cc - pvdz).@xcite obtained geometry and the lattice vectors , derived from the molecular size , were inserted as an input for the geometry optimization of the periodic structures , calculated by means of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) scheme ( with the pbe parametrization ) using the qe tool .",
    "the above procedure is accurate enough , since the central squares of porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives do not relax much after binding a metal.@xcite    it is known , that the dft approach underestimates the energy gaps and the energetic positions , with respect to the fermi level , of the localized d- or f - shells .",
    "this fact has consequences in the description of magnetization . in order to improve the treatment with the lack of the exact exchange",
    ", we applied the pseudopotential self - interaction correction ( psic ) method proposed by filippetti and spaldin,@xcite and implemented by us in the qe package.@xcite the psic method is superior to the dft+u approach@xcite for two reasons : ( i ) the correction is parameter free , unlike the dft+u parameters : the coulomb u and the exchange j , ( ii ) the correction is applied to all atomic shells , not only d- or f - shell of the transition metals or the rare earths .",
    "the psic - kernel includes the hartree and the exchange - correlation potentials , @xmath3 , calculated on the orbital - density @xmath4 , dependent on spin @xmath5 , and built using the atomic pseudopotential orbital , @xmath6 .",
    "the main equations are : @xmath7",

    "usefulness of this method has been demonstrated in a number of various applications.@xcite for this work , the most important are the relations between the energetic positions of the shells : @xmath0-tm , @xmath11-tm and @xmath12-tm , @xmath13-o and @xmath13-n .",
    "although , we included the sic for all atomic shells , these corrections are on - site - the same like in the dft+u approach and contrary to the nagaoka model , which includes the inter - site strong correlations on the parametric grounds.@xcite using the psic approach instead of the dft+u scheme is especially justified for the molecular crystals and 2d metal - organic frameworks , due to the fact they possess the flat band structures.@xcite in constrast , the ordinary strongly correlated systems such as the metal oxides and diluted magnetic semiconductors possess only @xmath14-type or @xmath15-type flat bands and the rest of projected atomic states have usual semiconducting bandwidths .",
    "in this study , we focus our attention on magnetism , which is a phenomenon sensitive to the system geometry .",
    "as mentioned in the theoretical details section , the geometry was optimized for all studied cases .",
    "positions of transition metal atoms above the plane of the nitrogens square and the oxygen - tm bond lengths are collected in the table  s1 in the supplemental information.@xcite inspecting the atomic gradients varied during the geometry optimization and the corresponding magnetizations of the systems , we noticed that a tiny change of the tm - positions or the tm - o bond - lengths can influence magnetizations .",
    "this effect is similar to the phenomenon observed in the perovskites@xcite and also for metal atoms at graphene and graphite.@xcite in our cases , however , the geometric effect does not alter main trends in the results reported below . +      in fig .  2 ,",
    "the total and absolute magnetizations in the elementary cells , obtained within the gga and the psic frameworks , are presented for porphyrins with all tm and tmo additions .",
    "the total magnetization , defined via the up and down spin - densities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as @xmath18 reflects the summed magnetization of the sample seen from a distance .",
    "in contrast , the absolute magnetization , defined as @xmath19 means a sum of the local magnetizations regardless their signum .",
    "large difference between the total and the absolute magnetizations gives an information on the space separation of the alterred magnetic moments , i.e. the ferrimagnetic character of the sample .",
    "ferrimagnetism is well pronounced for the porphyrins with metals from v to co , and it is the strongest in the mn , fe and feo cases for both calculation methods , gga and psic , and additionally in the v and vo cases obtained with the psic scheme . the spin - density map for the porphyrin - mn network is presented in fig .  3 for the psic method .",
    "the vanadium spin - density map is similar and included in fig .",
    "s2 in the supplemental information.@xcite it is clear that the nitrogen atoms are spin - polarized in the tm vicinity .",
    "the effect of oxygen addition on magnetization is very strong . in the case of the tm atoms from the first half of the @xmath0-row",
    ", the oxygen addition strongly reduces the magnetic moments ; except the porphyrin - sco network .",
    "in contrast , for the tm atoms from the second half of the @xmath0-row , addition of oxygen causes an increase of the magnetic moments .",
    "this is an interesting result - similar to the results for co - doping of metal - phthalocyanines with li@xcite - and might be utilized in spintronic devices .",

    "the differences between the lwdin population numbers for the spin up and spin down are the spin polarizations of chosen atomic orbitals .",
    "they are listed in table  1 , for all porphyrins with tm and tmo .",
    "we present the numbers obtained mainly with the psic scheme .",
    "the corresponding gga results are also listed , for a comparison , for the @xmath13-states of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and the tm atomic orbitals .",
    "the psic method usually tends to localize the electrons@xcite and delocalize the holes.@xcite with the dft+u method , the @xmath0-tm orbital occupations often increase and the @xmath22-orbital occupations of the tm - neighbours decrease , with respect to the dft result .",
    "for the psic method this is also usually true , due to the fact that the self - interaction correction is stronger for the localized shells .",
    "netherveless , this is not a golden rule and for some cases it might be broken . the cases of porphyrin - v and -vo are special . without oxygen , the @xmath22-orbitals of v are substantially occupied , because they overlap much with the neighbouring nitrogens .",
    "it is interesting that with the psic aproach , the polarization of @xmath22-v is antiferromagnetic ( af ) to @xmath0-v .",
    "large spin - polarizarions of nitrogens - around -0.3 @xmath26 , which gives -1.2 @xmath26 in total - are not surprising .",
    "nitrogen is an element which usually couples antiferromagnetically to tm - as for instance in ( gan , mn ) dilute magnetic semiconductor.@xcite moreover , the @xmath22-v orbitals overlap and couple ferromagnetically ( fm ) with the @xmath22-n shells . the fact that the @xmath12-shell of v in porphyrins is substantially occupied can be compared to the similar effect observed in ( gaas , mn)@xcite and si : mn.@xcite on the other hand , in the gga approach , the @xmath22-v shell couples ferromagnetically to @xmath0-v , since the strong si error is not corrected for the @xmath22-n orbitals .    for the porphyrin - vo",
    ", the @xmath22-n is also af - coupled with respect to @xmath0-v . with the difference that the strong coupling of @xmath22-v with n-@xmath22 is replaced by the v interaction with oxygen , which is more strongly polarizable than nitrogen .",
    "the spin polarization of oxygen is around -1.6 @xmath26 and antiferromagnetic with respect to @xmath0-v .",
    "the @xmath22-n localized spin is -0.27 @xmath26 , which is similar to that for porphyrin - v .",
    "however , the largest spin polarization of the @xmath22-n orbitals is in the case of porphyrin - mn , around -0.47 @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly , the coupling of @xmath22-n with respect to @xmath0-tm is antiferromagnetic not for all studied 2d networks - the exceptions are : porphyrin - co , -cu , -feo , -coo , -nio and -cuo .",
    "this is a consequence of the 4-fold crystal symmetry and the electronic filling of the @xmath0-tm orbitals .",
    "the tm atoms possess valence electrons of the @xmath27 and @xmath28type and need to make the bonds with 4 n atoms and oxygen .",
    "formation of the local magnetic moment at the tm atom means less electrons involved in the chemical bonds , and a hole might be delocalized over these bonds .",
    "the lack of tm electrons with the spin up at the tm - n bonds - for the cases with the d - shell less occupied than it is for mn - causes the domination of the spin down polarization at these bonds , and the magnetic coupling of n atoms to the tm is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the coupling changes signum with the growing number of electrons at the @xmath28-shell of tm , and the cases with ni and cu are ferromagnetically oriented to the n atoms",
    ". large spin polarization of the @xmath22-o orbitals is very promissing for tailoring spintronic devices .",
    "it is worth to notice that the orientation of the spin coupling at oxygen with respect to @xmath0-tm is usually the same as that of the coupling between @xmath22-n and @xmath0-tm .",
    "let us have a look at carbons of the porphyrin molecules and bridges ; these adjacent to nitrogens , denoted c1 , and farther , denoted : c2 , c3 and c4 - see the caption of table  1 and fig .",
    "the carbon atom denoted c1 bears a spin which couples af to @xmath0-v ( with local c1 moment of -0.12 @xmath26 ) for the vo case , and fm ( 0.21 @xmath26 ) for the porphyrin - v .",
    "other spin polarizations at c1 also deserve our attention : for porphyrin - fe ( 0.17 @xmath26 ) , p - mn ( 0.09 @xmath26 ) , p - feo and p - co ( 0.11 @xmath26 ) , and p - coo ( 0.12 @xmath26 ) .",
    "the carbon atoms denoted c2 polarize mostly in the case of porphyrin - co ( 0.08 @xmath26 ) .",
    "even far from the tm atom , c3 atoms , are spin - polarized around 0.04 - 0.07 @xmath26 for porphyrin - mn , -fe , -feo , -co , -coo .",
    "remarkably , in porphyrin - v , the carbon atom of the acetylenic - bridge , namely c4 , couples antiferromagnetically to c1 , and it is spin - polarized of about -0.1 @xmath26 .        the results presented in this subsection align with the experimental and theoretical conclusions of the work on porphyrin - cr adsorbed at the co surface.@xcite namely , the local spin - moments induced at nitrogens are af - coupled to cr , and the spin of less than halfly - occupied @xmath0-shell of cr is af - coupled to the more than halfly - occupied @xmath0-shell of co substrate - as in our case , it holds for the cr and o localized magnetic moments .    as for the difference between the psic and the gga results , the psic magnetizations are always larger than the gga ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hund s rule is strongly obeyed when the electron localization is higher  like in the psic and dft+u case .",
    "moreover , for the separate molecules , the magnetizations are localized only at the transition metals and oxygen .",
    "in contrast , for the periodic systems , the magnetizations are also partially localized on n , o , and even carbons of the acethylene bridges .    even if the magnetization is not localized at the acetylene bridges , the covalent bonds between the molecules are essential for the spin delocalization within the network - building molecules . without these bonds ,",
    "the molecules would be spin - polarized with the well localized integer spin multiplicity , which would not be present at the nitrogen atoms . in contrast , for the periodic systems containing the n atoms and magnetic impurities - such as already mentioned diluted magnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)n - the spin polarization is delocalized to the nitrogen atoms , with quite substantial contribution.@xcite    the more extensive view on the magnetization can be derived from the projected densities of states ( pdos ) onto the @xmath13-n , @xmath0-tm and @xmath13-o states , and the total dos , which are presented in fig .  5 ; for the results obtained with the psic approach .",
    "similar pdos plots for the gga method are included in fig .",
    "s3 in the supplemental information.@xcite the numbers presented in table  1 are obtained from the quadrature of the atomic spin - densities presented in fig .",
    "it is in the energy range from the bottom of the valence band - not presented in the figure - up to the fermi level .",
    "the spin - asymmetry of the pdos is visible for the cases : v , cr , mn , fe , and co without and with the oxygen .",
    "the spin - asymmetry of the @xmath13-n pdos is pronounced even for the cases where the lwdin spin - polarizations are rather small .",
    "interestingly , for some cases - like cr - the spin polarization at the fermi level does not show up , but the total contribution to magnetism originates from the deeper states . in this case , mostly from cr and less from the nitrogen atoms .      in fig .  5",
    ", we see that most of p - tm and p - tmo networks are metallic .",
    "the fermi levels of some cases - namely cr , mno , tio , ni , zn - are placed within a little energy gap .",
    "the half - metallicity is plausible in the cases : ti , cu , vo , cro , feo , coo , where the more accurate gw - calculations would be necessary.@xcite it is very usual for the tm - doped metallic systems , that the fermi level cuts the @xmath0-states .",
    "the effect of such methods like the dft+u or the psic with respect to the gga results moves the @xmath0-states away from the fermi level , if these states are not pinned to it . in our systems , however , some cases calculated with the gga approach show clearly the tm - based metallicity , while in the psic approach , the @xmath0 states disappear from the fermi level - e.g. for the porphyrin - mn , -fe , -vo , -mno , -coo and -ni networks .",
    "purely carbon - based metallicities in such magnetic systems like p - vo , p - mn and p - feo networks seem to be promissing for spintronic devices , because the magnetic couplings in these cases might be long range .",
    "interestingly , there are also the metallic systems where the oxygen states dominate at the fermi level .",
    "these systems are almost half metallic - for instance in the porphyrin - nio , -cuo and -zno networks .",
    "2d organic networks are promissing for spintronic applications . in this work",
    ", we searched for magnets among oxo - metal - porphyrins and metal - porphyrins connected with the acetylene bridges . for magnetism , the relative energetic positions of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 transition - metal states with respect to the @xmath13-states of the neighbouring atoms are very important .",
    "therefore , we used the self - interaction corrected pseudopotential scheme ( psic ) , within the dft framework for the calculations of the electronic structure .",
    "most of the porphyrin networks with tm and tmo are magnetic ; except the sc , tio , ni and zn cases .",
    "addition of oxygen increases the magnetizations for the second - half @xmath0-row tms and the sco case .",
    "the rest of cases : ti , v , cr and mn decrease magnetizations after the oxygen addition .",
    "difference between the total and absolute magnetizations indicate ferrimagnetism , which is the strongest for the porphyrin - v , -vo and -mn networks",
    ". further examination of the systems with the lwdin populations tool shows the af - coupling of the oxygen magnetic moment with the tm local moment for the p - vo and p - cro cases , and fm - coupling for the p - feo , p - coo , p - nio , p - cuo and p - zno systems .",
    "interestingly , in the p - sco case , the magnetic moment is localized at oxygen and not at tm , and in the mno case the situation is opposite . the strongest spin - polarization localized at nitrogens , and",
    "af - coupled to the @xmath0-tm local moment , was found for the p - mn , p - v , p - vo and p - fe cases .",
    "the same couplings are ferromagnetic for the p - nio , p - cu and p - cuo 2d networks .",
    "the spin - polarization effects are very long range for the porphyrin networks with the tms from v to co. in these cases , the spin - asymmetry of the atomic shells was found very far from the tm atoms , and it was well pronounced even on the acetylenic bridges .    in summary ,",
    "the ferrimagnetic cases found in our studies are characterized by the induced long - range spin - polarizations .",
    "these systems certainly would be good candidates for the high - t@xmath32 magnets and will show up new properties when are deposited at the surfaces of other materials .",

    "<S> magnetism in 2d networks of the acetylene - bridged transition metal porphyrins m(p)-2(c - c)-2 ( denoted p - tm ) , and oxo - tm - porphyrins om(p)-2(c - c)-2 ( denoted p - tmo ) , is studied with the density functional theory ( dft ) and the self - interaction corrected pseudopotential scheme ( psic ) . </S>",
    "<S> addition of oxygen lowers magnetism of p - tmo with respect to the corresponding p - tm for most of the first - half @xmath0-row tms . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , binding o with the second - half @xmath0-row tms or sc increases the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> ferrimagnetism is found for the porphyrin networks with the tms from v to co and also for these cases with oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> this is a long - range effect of the delocalized spin - polarization , extended even to the acetylene bridges . </S>"
