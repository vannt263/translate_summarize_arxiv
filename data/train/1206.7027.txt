    "large samples significantly improve our understanding of star formation . at the beginning of star formation studies in the early 70s , the palomar sky survey ( pss ) plates provided astronomers optical selected nebulae as targets of star forming regions .",
    "the catalogued shapeless hii regions @xcite from pss served as sources for investigating gas and dust properties of molecular cloud complex @xcite .",
    "nearby dark cores as well as cloud fragments were from lynds dark nebula @xcite .",
    "after visual inspection , 70 small opaque spots were chosen for the surveys of low - mass cores with the @xmath1co , c@xmath2o and nh@xmath11 respectively @xcite .",
    "a number of sources resulted in these earliest observations are still primary examples in low mass star formation so far .",
    "however , `` optical dark '' selection method is limited for probing star forming in the deep of molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite chose infrared sources for detecting high velocity outflows in high - mass star formation regions .",
    "particularly iras point sources afforded plenty samples for high mass star formation regions .",
    "based on the similar shapes of the far infrared flux distribution of all embedded o type stars , the iras color - color criteria were used to choose uc hii region candidates @xcite and further refined by molecular line studies @xcite .",
    "precursors of uc hii regions were also obtained from luminous iras sources and used for a number of surveys to examine the early characteristics of high mass star formation @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "earlier samples for high mass star formation come from infrared dark clouds surveyed by msx .",
    "these are extinction features against the bright mid - infrared background of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "a number of starless massive cores were detected , which are with narrower line widths and lower rotation temperatures than both uc hii region precursors and uchii regions but with similar masses @xcite .",
    "however , msx is limited to @xmath12b@xmath12@xmath13 of our galaxy .",
    "now planck surveys provide a wealth of early sources which are cold and with unprecedented complete space distribution .",
    "the cold core catalogue of planck objects ( c3po ) includes 10783 sources which are mainly cold clumps , intermediate structures of the fragmentation scenario .",
    "their temperatures and densities range from 7 to 17 k and 30 to 10@xmath14 @xmath15 respectively , derived from the fluxes in the three highest frequency planck bands ( 353 , 545 , 857 ghz ) and the 3000 ghz of iras band @xcite .",
    "this enables us to probe the characteristics of the prestellar phase or starless clumps .",
    "the all sky nature of the planck cold clump sample is particularly useful for studying the global properties of galactic star formation .",
    "follow up study with high resolution observations by herschel satellite revealed extended regions of cold dust with colour temperatures down to 11 k. the results show different evolutionary stages ranging from a quiescent , cold filament to clumps with star formation activities @xcite .    these known properties of planck cold clumps currently were revealed with various bands of continuum emissions and only a set of 8 c3po sources selected from different environment @xcite were investigated with molecular lines .",
    "examination with molecular lines is another essential aspect for understanding the properties of the planck cold clumps .",
    "molecular line studies of the planck clumps , which are an unbiased sample of cold dust clumps in the milky way , will provide clues to probe a number of critical questions about clumps and star formation : what are the morphologies , physical parameters and their variations in the galaxy ?",
    "what are the initial conditions of star formation , which we do not yet know in our current state of knowledge ?",
    "what are the dynamic factors in a variety of the clumps and is there any premonition of collapse ?",
    "is there any depletion and what are cold chemistry phenomena ? in which environment can the cold clump exist ?",
    "what is the highest galactic latitude where stars can form ?",
    "co is the most common tool to probe molecular regions .",
    "although there is `` dark gas '' which is undetected in the available co and hi surveys @xcite , co is still a basic probe to address the above questions .    in this paper",
    "we report a survey of planck cold clumps with j=1 - 0 lines of the @xmath0co and its major isotopes @xmath1co and c@xmath2o using the telescope of purple mountain observatory at qinghai province in western china .",
    "our target sources are chosen from the early cold core catalogue ( ecc ) , which are the most reliable detections of c3po clumps .",
    "so far we have surveyed 674 sources with single point observations and mapped a subset of ten clumps in different locations . in the next section",

    "using the 13.7 m telescope of qinghai station of purple mountain observatory ( pmo ) at de ling ha , the survey towards the ecc clumps with the lines of @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) was carried out from january to may , 2011 .",

    "a newly installed sis superconducting receiver with nine beam array was employed as the front end .",

    "the typical system temperature ( t@xmath18 ) in ssb mode is around 110 k and varies about 10% for each beam .",
    "an fft spectrometer was used as the back end , which is with a total bandwidth of 1 ghz and 16384 channels .",
    "the equivalent velocity resolution is 0.16 km  s@xmath19 for @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) line and 0.17 km  s@xmath19 for @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) and c@xmath2o ( 1 - 0 ) lines respectively .",
    "the position switch ( ps ) mode was adopted for single point observations . the off position for each `` off ''",
    "source was carefully chosen from the area within 3@xmath20 from the `` on '' source , which has no or extremely weak co emission based on the co survey of the milky way @xcite .",
    "for those regions without co data , we chose the off postions based on the iras 100 @xmath21 m images .",
    "the integration time at the on / off position is 30 s.    we also mapped ten sources which are with rather strong co emission . on - the - fly",

    "the antenna continuously scanned a region of 22@xmath22 centered on the planck cold clumps with a scan speed of 20@xmath16  s@xmath19 .",
    "the rms noise level was 0.2 k in main beam antenna temperature t@xmath23 for @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) , and 0.1 k for @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) and c@xmath2o ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "since the edges of the otf maps are rather noisy , only the central 14@xmath24 regions are analyzed .",

    "the spectral lines of the emission components depart from gaussian profile , which probably reflect the state of gas or originates from systematic motions and star formation activities .",

    "we use @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) and c@xmath2o ( 1 - 0 ) as the optically thin lines . if @xmath36 , the line is classified as `` blue profile '' , and if @xmath37 , the line is classified as `` red profile '' .",

    "this is the first time to show the good agreement of the center velocities of the @xmath0co and its main isotopes @xmath1co and c@xmath2o lines with such a large sample .",

    "since there are fewer sources with detected the c@xmath2o lines than those with the @xmath1co lines , we adopt the center velocity of the @xmath1co as the systemic velocity of the clumps in the following analysis . for the components without the @xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) emission ,",
