    "biochemical molecules in a cell fluctuate dynamically because of the stochastic nature of intracellular reactions , fluctuation of the environment , and the spontaneous dynamics of intracellular networks@xcite .",
    "some part of the fluctuation is noise that impairs or disturbs the robust operation of the intracellular networks .",
    "the other part , however , conveys information on complex dynamics of various factors inside and outside of the cell@xcite .",
    "dissecting fluctuation into distinct components with different biological roles and meanings is crucial for understanding the mechanisms how a cell controls and harnesses the noise and how information is transferred over apparently noisy intracellular network@xcite .",
    "the intracellular fluctuation is generated from the intracellular reactions or comes from the environment , and then propagates within the intracellular networks .",
    "the fluctuation of individual molecular species within the networks is therefore a consequence of the propagated fluctuation from the different sources .",
    "decomposition of the fluctuation into the contributions from the sources is the indispensable step for understanding their biological roles and relevance .",
    "when fluctuation propagates from one component to another unidirectionally without circulation , the fluctuation of the downstream can be decomposed into two contributions .",
    "one is the intrinsic part that originates within the pathway between the components .",
    "the other is the extrinsic part that propagates from the upstream component .",
    "such decomposition can easily be extended for the network with cascading or branching structures in which no feedback exists .",
    "this fact drove the intensive anatomical analysis of the intracellular fluctuation in the last decade .      in order to dissect fluctuation into different components ,",
    "two major strategies have been developed .",
    "one is to use the dependency of each component on different kinetic parameters in the network . by employing theoretical predictions on such dependency",
    ", we can estimate the relative contributions of different components from single - cell experiments with perturbations .",
    "possible decompositions of the fluctuation were investigated theoretically for various networks such as single gene expression@xcite , signal transduction pathways@xcite , and cascading reactions@xcite .",
    "some of them were experimentally tested@xcite .",
    "the other is the dual reporter system in which we simultaneously measure a target molecule with its replica obtained by synthetically duplicating the target . from the statistics of the target and the replica , i.e ,",
    "mean , variance , and covariance , we can discriminate the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the fluctuation because the former is independent between the target and the replica whereas the latter is common to them .",
    "the idea of this strategy was proposed and developed in @xcite , and verified experimentally for different species@xcite .",
    "its applicability and generality were further extended @xcite .",
    "now these strategies play the fundamental role to design single - cell experiments and to derive information on the anatomy of fluctuation from the experimental observations@xcite .",
    "even with the theoretical and the experimental advancement in decomposing fluctuation , most of works focused on the feedforward ( ff ) networks in which no feedback and circulation exist .",
    "as commonly known in the control theory@xcite , feedback ( fb ) loops substantially affect fluctuation of a network by either suppressing or amplifying it .",
    "actually , the suppression of fluctuation in a single gene expression with a fb loop was experimentally tested in @xcite earlier than the decomposition of fluctuation .",
    "while the qualitative and the quantitative impacts of the fb loops were investigated both theoretically and experimentally@xcite , we still lack a theoretical basis that can consistently integrate such knowledge with that on the fluctuation decomposition developed for the ff networks .    the main problem that hampers",
    "the integration is the circulation of fluctuation in the fb network . because fluctuation generated at a molecular component propagates the network back to itself ,",
    "we need to disentangle the causally interlocked influence between the components to define the relevant quantity for the impact of the fb loops . from the experimental point of view , in addition , quantification of the impact of fb loops by perturbative experiments is not perfectly reliable because artificial blocking of the fb loops inevitably accompanies the change not only in fluctuation but also in the average level of the molecular components involved in the loops .",
    "it is quite demanding and almost impossible for most cases to inhibit the loops by keeping the average level unchanged .",
    "we still lack an approach that enables us to infer the influence of the fb non - perturbatively as the dual reporter system does .      in this work",
    ", we resolve these problems by extending the work on the fluctuation decomposition@xcite and the dual reporter system@xcite . by using a single - loop fb network with two components and its linear noise approximation ( lna)@xcite ,",
    "we first provide a definition of the fb loop gain as fb efficiency that is consistent with the fluctuation decomposition in @xcite .",
    "then , we clarify the relation of the fb efficiency with the fluctuation propagation in a corresponding open - looped ff network . finally , by extending the dual reporter system , we propose a conjugate fb and ff system for estimating the feedback efficiency only from the statistics of the system non - perturbatively .",
    "we also give a fluctuation relation among the statistics that may be used to check the validity of the lna for a given network .",

    "let us consider a chemical reaction network consisting of @xmath0 different molecular species and @xmath1 different reactions .",
    "we assume that the stochastic dynamics of the network is modeled by the following chemical master equation : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : cme}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the numbers of the molecular species , @xmath4 is the probability that the number of molecular species is @xmath5 at @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the propensity function and the stoichiometric vector of the @xmath9th reaction , respectively@xcite .",

( [ eq : de ] ) is not relevant for analyzing the fluctuation of the network .",

    "( [ eq : de ] ) that satisfies @xmath17 . the stationary fluctuation of the network around @xmath16 is then obtained by solving the following lyapunov equation@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the covariance matrix of @xmath5 .",
    "when the propensity function @xmath21 is affine with respect to @xmath5 , the dynamics of @xmath22 determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) is identical to that of the first cumulant of @xmath23 , i.e. , the average of @xmath23 , as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the second cumulant , i.e. , the covariance matrix , follows the lyapunov equation as @xmath26 therefore , if the propensity function @xmath21 is affine , the stationary fluctuation of @xmath5 is exactly described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) . for a non - affine @xmath21 , eq .",

    "the previous work on the relation between the fluctuation decomposition and the information transfer for the ff network@xcite suggests that the fb loop gains can also be interpreted in terms of the information transfer . as a candidate for such information measure",
