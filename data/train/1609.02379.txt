    "giant stars are excellent candidates for both interferometric and asteroseismic observations .",
    "interferometers have been used for many years to measure the angular diameters of giants , from the mark iii interferometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the palomar testbed interferometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the navy precision optical interferometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , a sample of 25 k giant stars was measured by our team using the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array @xcite .",
    "the other technique under consideration for this sample is asteroseismology , the study of stellar oscillations .",
    "it is a unique tool to infer the structure of stellar interiors with very little model dependence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "photometric space missions focusing on asteroseismology ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , have dramatically increased both the number of stars with oscillation measurements as well as the quality of the data .",
    "these are critical measurements because the frequencies observed are dependent on the sound speed inside the star , which in turn depends on interior properties such as density , temperature , and gas motion @xcite .",
    "the stellar parameters resulting from these observations are key for testing stellar interior and evolutionary models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most giant stars , if not all of them , display measurable oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which makes them an ideal class of objects for deriving fundamental stellar parameters such as mass , radius , and temperature .",
    "they are bright , abundant , large enough to measure easily with interferometry , and exhibit radial velocity amplitudes from a few to several tens of m s@xmath0 .",
    "the observed oscillation frequencies put constraints on the star s internal structure @xcite , namely the mean density of the star , while interferometry measures the star s size .",
    "the combination leads to the masses for these single stars .",
    "the defining characteristic of a star is its mass but for giant stars , determining this quantity is indirect and heavily model dependent .",
    "often spectroscopic observations are used to measure a star s surface gravity ( log  @xmath1 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and iron abundance ( [ fe / h ] ) . the radius and mass",
    "are then determined by fitting evolutionary tracks to the star s position on the h - r diagram .",
    "this is an tricky process because the evolutionary tracks of stars with a large range of masses converge on the h - r diagram in the same region , and different evolutionary track models produce different masses for a given set of inputs . without good calibrating objects , no set of tracks",
    "can be proven to be the best .",
    "once we can test them by comparing theoretically determined mass and radius to measured values , we can have faith in applying the tracks to stars for which direct measurements are not possible .",
    "several of the stars in our sample are ear - marked for asteroseismic studies using precise stellar radial velocity ( prv ) measurements .",
    "it is difficult to obtain sufficient data in order to detect all pulsation modes using ground - based facilities .",
    "this requires a large amount of observing time often using multi - site campaigns .",
    "however , it is still possible to derive the stellar mass using a modest amount of ground - based data even taken at one site _ if _ one knows the stellar radius .",
    "this was done with some success for @xmath3 gem @xcite and @xmath4 dra @xcite .",
    "prv measurements will be made using the thuringia state observatory s 2 m telescope and mcdonald observatory s 2.7 m telescope , and results will be presented in a forthcoming paper . in the near future ,",
    "network telescopes such as the stellar oscillations network group ( song , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should be able to investigate better the pulsations in these stars using prvs .",
    "it is important , however , to first obtain stellar radii measurements , which is the goal of this paper .",
    "the measured angular diameters , when combined with other measurements from the literature , ultimately lead to radii ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath2 for the giant stars .",
    "these are important properties that characterize the star as well as the environment in which any possible exoplanets reside .",
    "section 2 discusses the spectroscopic measurements of @xmath2 , log @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] , section 3 describes the interferometric observations and calibrator star selection , section 4 outlines how we measure the angular diameter and calculate the @xmath5 , luminosity , and @xmath2 for our sample , section 5 explores the physical implications of our measurements and plans for oscillation measurements , and section 6 summarizes our findings .",
    "the sample of k giant stars presented here was obtained from the larger planet search survey of @xcite .",
    "the stars chosen are bright ( @xmath6 ) k giants that show significant short - term variability indicative of stellar pulsations , which makes them perfect candidates for future asteroseismic measurements .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained using the coud echelle spectrograph of the 2-m alfred jensch telescope of the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg .",
    "the spectrograph has a resolving power of @xmath7 , and the wavelength range used was 4700 to 7400  .",
    "standard iraf routines were used for subtracting the bias offset , flat - fielding , subtracting the scattered light , extracting the spectra , and for the wavelength calibration .    in order to determine @xmath2 , log @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] from the spectra ,",
    "a grid of model atmospheres from @xcite was used , which assumed a plane parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we used 144 unblended fei and 8 feii lines in the wavelength range 5806 and 6858  using the line list of @xcite .",
    "[ fe / h ] was determined by assuming that fei lines of different equivalent widths have to give the same relative abundance of iron . for @xmath2 ,",
    "an excitation equilibrium of fei and feii for lines of different excitation potentials was used , and log @xmath1 was determined from the ionization balance of fei to feii lines @xcite .",
    "the radii were obtained by using girardi evolutionary tracks @xcite in their web - based form .",
    "these tracks require a stellar magnitude , distance , @xmath2 , and [ fe / h ] , and the output is the radius , mass , and age of the star .",
    "the resulting [ fe / h ] , @xmath2 , log  @xmath1 , and @xmath5 values are listed in table  [ spec ] .",
    "interferometric observations were obtained using the chara array , a six element optical / infrared 1-meter telescope array located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "we used the pupil - plane `` chara classic '' beam combiner in the @xmath8-band ( 2.133  @xmath9 m ) , and the _ reduceir _ pipeline written by t. ten brummelaartheo / chara_reduction / climb_classic_math.pdf ] to reduce the data .",
    "we interleaved data scans of the k giant stars with two to three calibrator stars for each target .",
    "we chose our calibrators to be stars that are significantly less resolved on the baselines used than the targets .",
    "this means that uncertainties in the calibrator s diameter do not affect the target s diameter calculation as much as if the calibrator had a substantial angular size .",
    "all scans were taken as close in time and space as possible , with preference given to calibrators within 7@xmath10 of the targets , which was the case for all the target - calibrator pairings except for one with a separation of 12@xmath10 .",
    "we then converted instrumental target and calibrator measurements to calibrated data for the target stars .    to estimate the calibrator stars angular diameters",
    ", we created spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits to narrow- and wide - band photometric values published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as well as spectrophotometry from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite obtained via the interface created by @xcite .",
    "the assigned uncertainties for the 2mass infrared measurements are as reported in @xcite , which in some cases are on the order of 0.3 mag , and an uncertainty of 0.05 mag was assigned to the optical measurements .",
    "conversion from photometric magnitudes to fluxes incorporated zero - point uncertainties associated with the photometric systems as found in their reference literature ( e.g. , see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are on order 2@xmath11 .",
    "the flux - calibrated stellar templates of @xcite were chosen based on each star s spectral type and fit to the photometry .",
    "the templates were then adjusted to account for the overall flux level and reddening , and to estimate angular diameter using the @xmath12 minimization technique .",
    "the resulting seds gave us each star s bolometric flux ( @xmath13 ) and allowed for the calculation of extinction ( @xmath14 ) using the wavelength - dependent reddening relations of @xcite , assuming a ` standard ' r@xmath15=3.1 wavelength progression of reddening .",
    "the sed fits allowed us to check if there was any excess emission that might be due to an otherwise unknown low - mass companion or circumstellar disk .",
    "any calibrator candidates displaying variable radial velocities , photometric variations , or any indication of binarity were discarded .",
    "table [ obs_log ] lists the k giant stars observed , the date and baseline used , and calibrator information .",
    "we observed every target with multiple calibrator stars to check on the calibrators themselves .",
    "we used calibrator 1 as a check for calibrator 2 and vice versa , and used them individually as well as in conjunction to measure the angular diameter of the target star .",
    "these results were consistent , whether we used one or the other calibrator or both together , so there do not appear to be any systematics in the data arising from the calibrators themselves .",
    "we fit measured calibrated visibilities ( @xmath16 ) , the observed quantity of an interferometer , to both uniform disk ( ud ) and limb darkened ( ld ) angular diameters ( @xmath17 ) . for more details on this procedure , see @xcite . the uncertainties on @xmath16 consist of several parts combined in quadrature : the formal error on the mean of the visibility measurement ; the amount the calibrator s visibilities changes over the course of the observations ; and the calibrator diameters and their associated uncertainties .",
    "these are are taken into account using the calibration process described in @xcite .",
    "the conversion between ud and ld diameters involves the ld coefficient ( @xmath18 ) from @xcite , which was obtained using @xmath2 , log @xmath1 , and [ fe / h ] values from the spectroscopic observations with a microturbulent velocity of 2 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the average difference between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are on the order of a few percent , and the final @xmath21 is little affected by the choice of @xmath18 : a 20@xmath11 change in @xmath18 results in at most a 1@xmath11 change in @xmath21 .",
    "all stars have errors in @xmath21 1 to 3@xmath11 , except for hd 6497 , which has an error of 6@xmath11 and is the star with the smallest angular diameter .",
    "table [ inf ] lists @xmath20 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ ldplot ] shows the @xmath21 fits for all the stars .",
    "the calibrated visibilities are available in the online version of _ the astronomical journal_.    for each @xmath21 fit , the errors were derived via the reduced @xmath12 minimization method @xcite : the diameter fit with the lowest @xmath12 was found and the corresponding diameter was the final @xmath21 for the star .",
    "the errors were calculated by finding the diameter at @xmath22 on either side of the minimum @xmath12 and determining the differences between the @xmath12 diameter and @xmath22 diameters .",
    "the reduced @xmath12 were between 2 and 4 for all the stars , and when @xmath12 was forced to equal one , the errors increased .",
    "we used the larger errors to be on the conservative side , and these are the errors listed in table [ inf ] .",
    "we combined our @xmath21 measurements with _",
    "parallaxes @xcite to calculate the stars @xmath5 .",
    "in order to determine the luminosity ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath2 , we used the procedure described in section 3 to create sed fits .",
    "we combined our @xmath13 values with the stars distances ( @xmath24 ) to estimate @xmath23 using @xmath25 .",
    "we also combined the @xmath13 with @xmath21 to determine each star s @xmath2 by inverting the relation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is in radians .    considering that @xmath28 is selected based on a given @xmath2 , we checked to see if @xmath28 and the resulting @xmath21 changed based on our new @xmath2 .",
    "when selecting the updated @xmath28 using our measured @xmath2 , the largest difference in @xmath28 was 0.04 , which was the case for three stars , and was @xmath290.02 for the remainder .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 values changed at most by 0.5@xmath11 , and all but one changed by 0.3@xmath11 or less .",
    "this was well within the uncertainties on @xmath21 , and re - calculating @xmath2 with the new @xmath21 made at most a 14 k difference .",
    "the @xmath2 values all converged after this one iteration , and these are the final values listed in table [ inf ] .",
    "metallicity had a small effect on @xmath28 and the final @xmath21 : we varied the metallicity by @xmath301.0 and recalculated the @xmath28 and @xmath21 .",
    "it made at most a 0.003 mas change in the final diameters , which is within the errors .",
    "we compared the angular diameters predicted using the girardi tracks using spectroscopically determined @xmath2 and [ fe / h ] against the interferometric measurements in figure [ angdiam ] . for the most part ,",
    "the diameters agree within the errors and there is no clear bias .",
    "the error bars on the interferometric measurements are substantially smaller than those on the girardi diameters , between 3@xmath31 and 19@xmath31 smaller : the errors for @xmath32 are on the order of 1 to 3@xmath11 with just one at 6@xmath11 , while the errors for @xmath33 range from 11@xmath11 to 18@xmath11 .",
    "the largest outliers in figure [ angdiam ] are hd 31579 and hd 157681 .",
    "the latter was observed as part of @xcite , and its interferometric diameter of 1.664@xmath300.010 mas was larger than the diameter predicted by spectroscopy ( 1.27@xmath300.24 mas ) .",
    "baines et al .",
    "concluded it was likely due to the calibrator star used ( hd 158460 ) so we observed it again using two different calibrators .",
    "our new diameter of 1.901@xmath300.013 mas is even larger than the previous measurement .",
    "however , when the data are analyzed using each calibrator star separately , the resulting angular diameters are remarkably consistent with a mere 0.003 mas difference .",
    "when the calibrators are used to calibrate each other , no systematic offsets are present .",
    "we also used the relationship described in @xcite between the angular diameter and the ( @xmath34 ) color to estimate hd 157681 s diameter and obtained 2.05@xmath35 mas , which agrees with our new interferometric measurement to within the errors .",
    "as for hd 31579 , the spectroscopically determined angular diameter ( 0.91@xmath300.36 mas ) is the outlier when considered against the those determined using the sed fit ( 1.60@xmath300.12 mas ) , the ( @xmath34 ) color ( 1.67@xmath300.27 mas ) , and the interferometric measurement ( 1.593@xmath300.008 mas ) .",
    "all the diameters are consistent and agree to within the errors except for the spectroscopic calculation .",
    "we plotted the spectroscopically determined @xmath2 versus our interferometric results in figure [ tcompare ] .",
    "there is some scatter off the 1:1 line with the spectroscopic values tending to be cooler than the interferometric ones by an average of @xmath36380 k. the discrepancy may be due to the atmospheric models of k giant stars in the near - ultraviolet lacking a source of thermal extinction , which could affect the @xmath2 measurements @xcite .",
    "another cause may lie in the methods used to determine @xmath2 : interferometry measures the overall @xmath2 of the star while spectroscopic values rely on fei and feii lines and measure the @xmath2 in the thin layers of the atmosphere where those lines are formed . in dwarf stars ,",
    "local thermodynamic equilibrium is a reasonable assumption and the @xmath2 determined using the iron lines is the same as the @xmath2 of the atmosphere overall . for giant stars ,",
    "the atmosphere is more extended and the models may not be correct due to factors such as convection .",
    "another consideration may be that the 1-d models do not include geometrical surface cooling and the 2-d models may not be as extended as real stars , so do not perfectly describe the atmospheres .",
    "hd 157681 is again an object of interest when it comes to determining its @xmath2 . in order to match @xmath37",
    ", @xmath2 would have to drop from 4400 k to 3844 k , which is much closer to the 3900 k predicted by the ( @xmath38 ) color .",
    "this has the effect of moving the star from below the 1:1 line in figure [ tcompare ] to above it , which is consistent with the rest of the stars except for hd 31579 .",
    "hd 157681 is the coolest giant in the sample , which is expected because it is a k5 star while the others are k0 to k3 .    as an independent check on @xmath2",
    ", we used the equations from @xcite that relate ( @xmath38 ) color , bolometric correction ( bc@xmath39 ) , and @xmath2 for stars between 3300 and 5000 k. the results are listed in table [ tcompare_table ] .",
    "color @xmath2 are even cooler than the spectroscopic @xmath2 , except for hd 216174 where they are equal .",
    "on average the spectroscopic @xmath2 are hotter than the color @xmath2 by @xmath36320 k , while the interferometric @xmath2 are hotter on average by @xmath36580 k. we also did a search in the literature using the vizier service and averaged all available @xmath2 values , and these are included in table [ tcompare_table ] .    as a final check , we calculated both @xmath21 and @xmath2 using the relations between them and the surface brightness and ( @xmath34 ) color , respectively , described in @xcite . table [",
    "tcompare_table ] lists the resulting values , which are also plotted in figure [ diams_teff ] .",
    "the diameters show a scatter around the 1:1 ratio but are within the errors , and we see a similar offset in @xmath2 , where our new measurements are hotter than those predicted using mozurkewich et al.s equations for seven of the nine stars .",
    "when we compare the temperatures determined spectroscopically , interferometrically , and using the ( @xmath34 ) colors , four of the nine stars have @xmath40 that fall in between the @xmath41 and @xmath42 .      the velocity amplitude of the k giant stars p - mode oscillations range from a few to tens of ms@xmath0 , depending on the evolutionary state of the star @xcite .",
    "the mode periods range from several hours to days .",
    "these amplitudes and periods are measureable with 2 - 3 m class telescopes using precise stellar rv measurements , which typically reach a precision of @xmath361 ms@xmath0 .",
    "we intend to use the coud echelle spectrograph of the 2-m alfred jensch telescope of the thuringia state observatory to detect the stellar oscillations in those stars for which we have interferometrically measured @xmath5 .",
    "an iodine absorption cell will be used to provide the wavelength calibration for the rv measurement .",
    "this instrument is able to achieve and rv precision of @xmath362 ms@xmath0 on bright k giant stars @xcite .",
    "fundamental stellar parameters of k giant stars are important for exoplanet studies because of their masses , which can be 1.53 @xmath43 . main - sequence stars of this mass range are ill - suited for rv measurements due to a paucity of stellar lines and high stellar rotation rates . thus k giants offer us a means to study planet formation around stars more massive than the sun .      determining @xmath44 for these giant stars is key to understanding whether or not planet populations orbiting massive stars are different than planets found orbiting solar - type stars .",
    "some scientists argue that more massive stars host more massive planets , and that a stars are at least five times more likely to host a giant planet than an m dwarf @xcite .",
    "there are models that support this theory : e.g. , @xcite . however , @xcite disagrees , claiming the masses determined for the exoplanet host stars are in error due to the convergence and crossing of evolutionary tracks from stellar models .",
    "this leads to degeneracies , and lloyd believes the masses of the evolved stars are not as high as those claimed by previous studies .",
    "our ultimate contribution to this controversy will be the direct determination of @xmath44 for our sample of giant stars by combining our interferometric @xmath5 with the asteroseismic density measurements",
    ". we will then be able to determine if the models are indeed correct , and test if the idea that more massive stars host more massive planets is valid .",
    "we measured the angular diameters of nine k giant stars that are the targets for future exoplanet searches and asteroseismology studies .",
    "we combined our measurements with information from the literature to calculate each star s @xmath5 and @xmath2 , and used sed fits to determine @xmath23 and @xmath13 .",
    "our improved angular diameter precision translates directly to smaller errors when calculating the physical radii for these targets , which will in turn lead to reduced errors when determining the mass from stellar oscillation studies .",
    "once those masses have been measured , we can compare them to results from evolutionary models to help distinguish between which isochrones best match our observations .",
    "those models can then be applied to stars for which interferometric or asteroseismic measurements are not possible .",
