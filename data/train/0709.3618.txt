    "the orbital selective mott transition ( osmt ) in multi - orbital correlated systems , where the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in different orbitals happens successively with the variation of doping , interaction , or field , was proposed @xcite to interpret the two consecutive phase transitions and spin state transition in the layered perovskite ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "great theoretical efforts have been paid to unearth the essential of the osmt by the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and some other approaches @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed that the two successive mits and the osmt are robust features in the two - orbital and three - orbital hubbard models with asymmetric bandwidths .",
    "meanwhile , the essential aspects of the osmt are not well understood .",
    "for example , the effect of hund s coupling in osmt is still not clear .",

    "only the hybridization of the two orbitals at the same site was considered recently in reference [ 11,17 ] .",
    "it is expected that the presence of the interorbital hopping will profoundly affect osmt . moreover , both the experiments @xcite and the first principle calculations @xcite demonstrated that with the increase of doping in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the structure distortions arising from the rotation and tilting of ruo@xmath15 octahedra play an important role in the two successive mits . as we will analyze later , such distortions lead to the decline of the level center of the narrow band with respect to the wide one , giving rise to a negative crystal field splitting .",
    "the aim of this paper is to elucidate the combining effect of two important factors , i.e. interorbital hopping and crystal field splitting , on the optical conductivity and the osmt in multiorbital correlated model and realistic multiorbital material ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "we study the optical conduction of two - orbital hubbard model within the framework of the extended linearized dynamical mean field theory ( eldmft ) @xcite , which has been proved extensively to be an efficient method , especially for the complicated multiorbital models .",
    "we demonstrate how the interorbital hopping and the negative crystal field splitting affect the nature of osmt and the optical conductivity of the systems .",
    "we find that the osmt regime enlarges in the presence of the interorbital hopping , but the negative crystal field splitting strongly restrains the occurrence of osmt .",

    "is transformed into a new effective two - orbital model without interorbital hopping , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the interaction hamiltonian under the canonical transformation . from eq.(2 ) , we can distinguish the effects of the interorbital hopping from the crystal - field splitting more clearly within the new fermion representation .",
    "that is , the finite interorbital hopping @xmath23 increases the bandwidth ratio of the two effective orbitals ; while the crystal field splitting @xmath36 induces a certain extent of the orbital hybridization of the two effective orbitals at the same site . when @xmath37=0 , the green s function is diagonal in the new fermion representations , and we can employ the dmft approach to study the two - orbital model easily . on the other hand , when both the crystal field splitting and the interorbital hopping are taken into account , the off - diagonal components of the green s function appear in this fermion representation .",
    "in this situation , to discuss the effect of crystal field splitting , we can use the similar technique adopted by medici _",
    "_ @xcite and buenemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the two - orbital models with the on - site orbital hybridization .",
    "in addition , further transformation can be introduced to diagonal the green s function .",

    "we present the evolution of quasiparticle weight with the interaction @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) for a two - orbital model with different orbital bandwidths @xmath81 .",
    "we find that when the coulomb interaction @xmath24 increases to @xmath82 , the first mit , i.e. the osmt , happens .",
    "the second transition occurring at @xmath83 is the conventional mit .",
    "the quasiparticle contribution to the optical conductivity arises from the electronic transitions between the lower and the upper hubbard subbands . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) , the drude peaks of both orbitals are considerably large as @xmath84 , which demonstrates that the system is in the metallic phase . on the contrary ,",
    "the drude peaks of both ortitals vanish completely in the insulating region with @xmath85 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](d ) . however , in the omst regime with @xmath86 , the drude peak of the narrow band vanishes and only the wide band contributes to the conduction channel in the optical conductivity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) .",
    "similar to the orbital ordering in manganites and vanadates , the osmt phase is also orbital polarized in the wide channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , the osmt phase can be detected by using the polarized synchrotron radiation light to measure the distinct optical conduction behaviors of different orbitals .",
    "apart from the low - energy drude - like feature coming from the coherent quasiparticle dos existing near @xmath87 , there is another spectral feature , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b)-(d ) , centered at the intermediate energy , which represents the charge transfer from the lower and upper hubbard subbands . since the general feature of dos , i.e. the lower and upper hubbard subbands and a quasiparticle resonance at fermi surface , can be reproduced by eldmft , our numerical results of optical conductivity are qualitatively accurate .",
    "to quantitatively compare with experiments on ca@xmath0sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 , more accurate dos should be adopted rather than the semicircular dos , and all three @xmath88 orbitals should be taken into account .",
    "this needs to be studied in future work .",
    "[ fig_2 ]      since the interorbital hopping is significant in real material , it is crucial to dig out its effect on the phase diagram and the optical conductivity . to our knowledge , no work has been done to take this important factor into consideration .",
    "till now , only the hybridization of the two orbitals at the same site had been studied by dmft @xcite , where the osmt tends to be destroyed",
    ". however , the physical origins of the on - site intra - atomic hybridization and nn interorbital hopping are quite different . by analyzing the quasiparticle weight at fermi surface",
    ", we obtain the phase diagram of the two - orbital hubbard model with interorbital hopping integrals @xmath89 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2](b ) . for the convenience of comparison ,",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath90 is also shown in fig .  [ fig_2](a ) . in both cases , a stable osmt regime ( the red shadow ) lies between the mott insulating ( denoted by `` i '' ) and the conventional metallic ( denoted by `` m '' ) phases .",
    "when the interorbital hopping is finite , for example @xmath89 , the area of the osmt regime greatly expands , in comparison with the case @xmath78 .",
    "it should be noted that the osmt we observed here is for the effective orbitals in the new fermion representation , which are the hybridized orbitals of the two realistic orbitals @xcite . within this representation",
    ", one could find that the bandwidth ratio of the current two effective orbitals increases with the increase of the interorbital hopping integrals @xmath23 : the wide quasiparticle band becomes wider , while the narrow one becomes narrower .",
    "thus the osmt occurs more easily , and its area expands a lot in the phase diagram for large @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , we also find that for zero and nonzero interorbital hopping , the osmt regime is close to the @xmath91 line , but never crosses it .",
    "our result of t@xmath92=0 agrees with medici _",
    "_ s phase diagram obtained by slave boson approach ; however , at @xmath93 , our result is slightly different from the result obtained by koga _",
    "@xcite for @xmath13 in which the osmt regime crosses the @xmath91 line",
    ".    the important role of the interorbital hopping @xmath23 in the osmt also manifests in the optical conductivity . starting from an insulating case with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath78",
    ", we obtain the typical feature of insulating optical conductivity for both the narrow band and the wide one . without the interorbital",
    "hopping , the system is a conventional mott insulator , and the drude peaks of both effective orbitals vanish . as shown by the black dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) and [ fig_3](b ) , there is no drude peak for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the peaks in the intermediate energy region clearly show the hopping between the subbands separated by the intraorbital coulomb interactions .",
    "it is obvious that the interorbital hopping @xmath23 does not significantly change the intermediate - energy band structures in the dos of the narrow band .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) , we find that the drude peak of the optical conductivity of the wide band @xmath58 crucially changes with the increase of the interorbital hopping @xmath23 .",
    "as @xmath23 increases to 0.5 and unity , the drude peak in @xmath58 considerably increases , implying that the system enters into the osmt regime .",
    "we also find that the quasiparticle weight drops abruptly at the two successive mit points , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](c ) , when the finite interorbital hopping is taken into account .",
    "we observe a small plateau near the metal - osmt transition point , which primarily shows that both of the two successive mits are first - order .",
    "the order of the osmt deserves further study .",
    "the level splitting of the two orbitals @xmath36 arising from the crystal field is another important factor that influences the essential of the mit and the osmt in the two - orbital systems . to study the evolution of the optical conductivity of the compound ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with the crystal field splitting @xmath36 , we start from an osmt phase with the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath93 , which lies in the red shadow regime in the phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "the green s function is defined as , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the bare dispersion relations for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 effective orbitals , respectively .",
    "obviously , we can directly define the local green function as @xmath103 with @xmath104 here @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the diagonal and off - diagonal terms of the self - energy matrix , respectively .",
    "based on the special feature of the above off - diagonal green s function in eq .",
    "( [ eq_g0 ] ) , we can introduce an unitary matrix @xmath107 to diagonalize eq .",
    "( [ eq_g0 ] ) as an effective green s function , @xmath108 with @xmath109 for a half - filling asymmetric two - orbital system , when the relationship @xmath110 is satisfied in the energy region close to the fermi surface , we can approximate the above dispersion relations in the first order as , @xmath111.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that the finite crystal field splitting mixes the two effective @xmath30- and @xmath31-orbital in the low energy regime , and as a result , the osmt is suppressed .",
    "we employ the eldmft approach @xcite to numerically solve the corresponding impurity problem , and find that the osmt phase is strongly influenced by the transfer of electrons between the two effective orbitals .",
    "we start from an osmt phase with @xmath112 , in which the electrons in the narrow orbital are localized and itinerant in the wide one , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4](c ) , the osmt character clearly manifests in the drude peak of each orbital : the drude peak vanishes completely for insulating narrow orbital , while the wide orbital is metallic with a finite drude peak .    when the crystal field splitting becomes negative as @xmath113 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_4](a ) ) and -0.25 ( see fig .  [ fig_4](b ) ) , the narrow orbital shifts to the lower energy region , and a fraction of electrons in the wide orbital transfers to the narrow orbital . the electron filling in the narrow orbital is more than a half , thus the narrow orbital also becomes metallic .",
    "in this situation , the drude peak of the narrow orbital appears again . on the other hand ,",
    "as the crystal field splitting is positive , the narrow orbital keeps its insulating character and the wide one is metallic .",
    "so the system remains in the osmt phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4](d ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that in both the metallic and insulating phases near the border of the osmt regime , a small negative crystal field splitting can drive neither the metallic system nor the insulating system into the osmt phase .",
    "therefore , the negative crystal field splitting is not in favor of the stable osmt phase , even in the presence of the finite interorbital hopping integrals .",
    "this result is contrary to that of dai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who supported that the osmt exists in the three - orbital hubbard model with crystal field splitting .      for the compound ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 ,",
    "the crystal field splitting arises from the structure distortions , and it can be approximately modeled as a two - orbital system since the double degeneracy of the narrow d@xmath114 bands is kept over the whole doping range . within the framework of the single - ion crystal field theory @xcite , we investigate the crystal field splitting between the d@xmath114 orbitals and the d@xmath115 orbital with the doping concentration x varying from 0.0 to 2.0 . according to the crystal structures for x=2.0 , 0.5 , 0.2 , 0.1 and 0 @xcite , we find that in the most doping region , the narrow d@xmath114 bands are lower than the broad d@xmath115 band , showing that the negative crystal field splitting is dominant . noting that though the single - ion crystal field theory is relatively simple , it is qualitatively correct for the sign and the relative magnitude of the crystal field splittings . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) , the averaged splittings between the d@xmath114 and the d@xmath115 bands are @xmath116= -0.013 , -0.11 , -0.012 , 0.0025 and 0.005 for x=2.0 , 0.5 , 0.2 , 0.1 and 0 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath117 is a positive constant , representing the @xmath118-orbital radial integral of the single - particle potential ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the level separation of the narrow d@xmath114 bands from the wide d@xmath115 band in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 varies gradually from positive to negative with the increase of sr concentration , and have the largest value as @xmath10 .",
    "this largest level separation arises from the rotation - type distortion @xcite , which becomes the most significant when @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath120 further decreases , the tilting distortion of the ruo@xmath15 octahedra @xcite becomes more important , which usually mixes different orbitals .",
    "since the normal state of sr@xmath5ruo@xmath2 is metallic , our preceding results shows that negative crystal field splitting is unfavor of stable osmt phase .",
    "therefore , our results exclude the possibility of the osmt occurring in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 when x increases from 0.2 to 2.0 .",
    "very recently , liebsch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that in compound ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the splitting of the @xmath9 to the @xmath11 bands is positive . in their study , the band structures in compound ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is rigid , and thus the variation of electron occupations in different orbitals arises from the change of the positive crystal field splitting .",
    "based on this hypothesis , liebsch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and werner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed the role of the positive crystal field splitting on the mit in two - orbital hubbard model .",
    "however , lee _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that with the doping increasing from x=0 to 2 , the bandwidths of the @xmath11 and @xmath9 orbitals considerably change , implying that the rigid band approximation is not proper .",
    "based on the above findings , the two successive mit in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is obviously independent of the osmt .",
    "a question arises : what happens in the first unconventional mit at x=0.2 ?",
    "we notice that at the doping concentration of x=0 and x=0.5 , the doped ruthenates are found to be orbital ordering .",
    "therefore , the two successive mit should be accompanied by the transitions of the ordered orbital states , which have not been well treated in the literature . to account for the properties of these two mit",
    ", the orbital ordering should be taken into account properly within the dmft approach , which has gone beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have studied the effects of two important factors , i.e. the crystal field splitting and interorbital hopping , on osmt in nondegenerate two - orbital models and in the compounds ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "our results show that the negative crystal field splitting can hybridize the two nondegenerate orbitals at the same lattice site , and strongly restrain the appearance of the osmt phase .",
    "however , the finite interorbital hopping considerably expands the osmt region in the phase diagram . in the doping region form @xmath3 to 2.0 in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the crystal field splitting introduced by the distortion of the ruo@xmath15 octahedra is found to be negative .",
