    "the leading - logarithm ( ll ) contribution to the effective potential @xmath0 in the standard model in which there is a single scalar field and no mass scale in the classical limit , has been used to estimate the higgs mass to be @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigations indicate that contributions beyond ll to @xmath0 do not destabilize this result @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose to significantly improve the methods used in refs .",
    "@xcite and compute the resulting modification to the estimate of @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 obtained using these improvements is much more realistic .",
    "since these results were obtained , it has been established that when the cw renormalization scheme is used to compute @xmath0 , all @xmath23 contributions to @xmath0 can be computed using the ( @xmath24 ) loop rg functions when there is a single scalar field @xmath25 without a classical mass term for this scalar in the action @xcite .",
    "we first show how these techniques can be used to refine the approach of @xcite . in doing so , we overcome several shortcomings of the original calculation .",
    "first of all , the rg functions we use are those appropriate to the cw renormalization scheme , not the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme .",
    "this conversion from the ms scheme ( in which the rg functions were originally computed ) to the cw scheme was not carried out in @xcite .",
    "next , we show how the @xmath23 contributions to @xmath0 can be expressed exactly in terms of the ( @xmath26 ) loop cw rg functions .",
    "this shows that once the @xmath27 loop cw rg functions are known , we have an exact expression for the @xmath27 loop contributions to @xmath0 without having to compute any feynman diagrams and , in addition , we can sum all the @xmath23 contributions to @xmath0 coming from all orders in the loop expansion . in @xcite",
    "these contributions were only given as a power series in the couplings @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we compute the counter - term that takes into account all log - independent contributions to @xmath0 beyond the @xmath23 order in a more consistent way than was done in @xcite ; rather than fixing this counter - term by the @xmath10 calculation and then using this value at higher order , we determine the value of this counter - term at each order separately thereby taking into account how the value of the coupling @xmath3 is adjusted .",
    "it is the methods of ref .  @xcite that allow us to fix all @xmath28 independent contributions to @xmath0 in terms of the rg functions when using the cw scheme .",
    "our analytic approach supplements numerical techniques for investigating @xmath0 using the rg equation ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the next section",
    "we review how @xmath23 contributions to @xmath0 can be computed in terms of the rg functions when the cw renormalization scheme is used , first considering the case in which there is a single @xmath29 scalar field with only a quartic self coupling and no classical mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "the only mass scale in such a theory is radiatively induced .",
    "this is then extended so that the scalar couples to other fields ( both vectors and spinors ) .",
    "the details of the solution at @xmath30 are presented in appendix 1 along with an explanation of how the methodology can be extended to @xmath19 and higher - order .",
    "appendix 2 presents a method of computing terms in the derivative expansion of the one loop effective action .",
    "we have employed the cw renormalization scheme , as in this scheme all logarithmic dependence on the external field comes through a single form of logarithm , @xmath31 .",
    "having this single logarithm simplifies the ansatz we make for @xmath0 when there are multiple couplings ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) below ) , making it possible to find @xmath0 in terms of the cw rg functions . if there are multiple couplings ( say @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) then both @xmath32 and @xmath33 arise when using the ms renormalization scheme .",
    "this complicates the ansatz one has for @xmath0 , making it no longer feasible to find @xmath0 in terms of the ms rg functions .",
    "furthermore , one must compute the radiative corrections dependent on @xmath25 to the kinetic term @xmath34 in the effective lagrangian when determining the radiatively generated higgs mass @xmath16 ; this is unknown ( and presumably non - trivial ) in the ms scheme , whereas in the cw scheme it is defined to be equal to one at the value of @xmath25 that minimizes @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) below ) . for these reasons we use the cw scheme in our analysis .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of a quadratic mass term @xmath35 for the @xmath36 scalar field in the classical action results in multiple forms of the logarithm occurring in the ansatz for @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and also necessitates consideration of a  cosmological term \" ( see ref .",
    "these factors considerably complicate employing the rg equation to find the @xmath23 contributions to @xmath0 ; we thus restrict ourselves to the classically conformal case @xmath37 as originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then discuss the conversion of the rg functions from the ms scheme , in which they have been originally computed , to the cw scheme , which is necessary to implement our procedure for computing the @xmath23 contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we finally apply these results to the simplest version of the standard model in which there is a single scalar which is an @xmath38 doublet and which has no mass at the classical level .",
    "the resulting expression for the effective potential at @xmath20 order leads to an estimate of @xmath21 for the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "we regard this as an upper limit on the higgs mass as lower order calculations lead to estimates that are considerably higher than this . in any case",
    ", the proposal @xcite that the higgs mechanism is a consequence of radiative corrections to the effective potential in the conformally invariant classical limit of the standard model is seen to be viable .",
    "we note that the potential @xmath0 being considered here is the sum of all one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams with external scalar fields whose momentum vanishes .",
    "this 1pi potential has been argued to be distinct from the  effective potential \" , a quantity shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be convex and real .",
    "the relationship between the 1pi potential and the effective potential is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , resolution of the convexity problem continues to be debated in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the most recent examination of the convexity problem explores the distinctions between the euclidean and minkowskian formulations of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "although our work adopts the conventional approach of ascribing physical meaning to the 1pi potential @xcite , it is important to note that our higgs mass predictions in the standard model rely upon only the _ local _ properties of the 1pi potential near the minimum as extracted from the rg equation .",
    "since this minimum occurs at non - zero field values , the minimum corresponds to the qualitative non - perturbative form of a spontaneous symmetry breaking effective potential @xcite and provides the lower bound on the region where the effective potential and 1pi potential coincide @xcite .",
    "therefore our analysis is not in conflict with ref .",
    "@xcite , which argues that the 1pi and effective potential must agree near the minimum and advocates the use of rg methods .",
    "finally we note that non - perturbative approaches are not isolated from the convexity problem .",
    "for example , the constraint effective potential @xcite in lattice approaches is non - convex at finite volumes @xcite , and lattice results are found to agree with the perturbative 1pi potential in appropriate regions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "functional flows of the exact renormalization group can be used to calculate an effective _ average _ action @xcite and convexity constrains the regulators used in various truncation schemes used in these methods @xcite .",
    "other alternatives to the effective potential include the gaussian effective potential @xcite which is well - suited to variational techniques .",
    "we begin by considering an @xmath29 scalar field @xmath25 with a classical potential @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the usual scalar coupling constant but @xmath3 is more useful as it removes explicit factors of @xmath42 in rg functions .",
    "the coupling @xmath3 is renormalized so that the effective potential @xmath0 satisfies the cw renormalization condition @xcite @xmath43 is satisfied .",
    "radiative corrections to the effective potential @xcite with this renormalization condition take the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 . in order that there be no net dependence on the renormalization scale parameter @xmath1 , @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 the rg equation and its solution for @xmath0 in eq",
    ".   corresponds to the situation where there is no quadratic term for the scalar field , consistently maintaining the massless nature of the theory .",
    "in particular , extension to massive theories is achieved by including a mass term and anomalous mass dimension into the rg equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of a single - component massive scalar theory ) .",
    "it is therefore not necessary for us to impose the @xmath49 renormalization condition used by coleman & weinberg @xcite to eliminate quadratic divergences .",
    "furthermore , vacuum graphs do not generate divergences that are eliminated by renormalization of the cosmological term @xcite . as outlined below",
