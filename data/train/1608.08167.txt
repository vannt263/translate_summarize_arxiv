    "the cycle of sunspots involves the generation and recycling of the sun s toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) dynamo mechanism that achieves this is sustained by the energy of solar internal plasma motions such as differential rotation , turbulent convection and meridional circulation .",
    "the toroidal field is generated through stretching of the poloidal component by differential rotation @xcite and is believed to be stored and amplified at the overshoot layer @xcite beneath the base of the solar convection zone ( scz ) .",
    "strong toroidal flux tubes are unstable to magnetic buoyancy and erupt through the surface producing sunspots , which are strongly magnetized and have a systematic tilt @xcite .",
    "the poloidal field is believed to be regenerated through a combination of helical turbulent convection ( traditionally known as the mean - field @xmath0-effect ; @xcite ) in the main body of the scz and the redistribution of the magnetic flux of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs ( the babcock - leighton process ; @xcite ) .    despite early ,",
    "pioneering attempts to self - consistently model the interactions of turbulent plasma flows and magnetic fields in the context of the solar cycle @xcite such full mhd simulations are still not successful in yielding solutions that can match solar cycle observations .",
    "this task is indeed difficult , for the range of density and pressure scale heights , scale of turbulence and high reynolds number that characterize the scz is difficult to capture even in the most powerful supercomputers .",
    "an alternative approach to modelling the solar cycle is based on solving the magnetic induction equation in the scz with observed plasma flows as inputs and with additional physics gleaned from simulations of convection and flux tube dynamics .",
    "these so called flux transport dynamo models have shown great promise in recent years in addressing a wide variety of solar cycle problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , solar dynamo models based on the babcock - leighton mechanism for poloidal field generation have been more successful in explaining diverse observational features of the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "recent observations also strongly favor the babcock - leighton mechanism as a major source for poloidal field generation @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the poloidal field generation is essentially predominantly confined to near - surface layers . for the dynamo to function efficiently , the toroidal field that presumably resides deep in the interior has to reach the near - surface layers for the babcock - leighton poloidal source to be effective .",
    "this is achieved by the buoyant transport of magnetic flux from the sun s interior to its surface ( through sunspot eruptions ) .",
    "subsequent to this the poloidal field so generated at near - surface layers must be transported back to the solar interior , where differential rotation can generate the toroidal field .",
    "the deep meridional flow assumed in such models ( see fig .",
    "1 , left - hemisphere ) plays a significant role in this flux transport process and is thought to govern the period of the sunspot cycle @xcite .",
    "moreover , a fundamentally crucial role attributed to the deep equatorward meridional flow is that it allows the parker - yoshimura sign rule @xcite to be overcome , which would otherwise result in poleward propagating dynamo waves in contradiction to observations that the sunspot belt migrates equatorwards with the progress of the cycle @xcite .",
    "while the poleward meridional flow at the solar surface is well observed ( hathaway & rightmire 2010 ; 2011 ) the internal meridional flow profile has remained largely unconstrained . a recent study utilizing solar supergranules @xcite suggests that the meridional flow is confined to within the top 10% of the sun ( fig .  1 , right - hemisphere ) ",
    "much shallower than previously thought .",
    "independent studies utilizing helioseismic inversions are also indicative that the equatorward meridional counterflow may be located at shallow depths @xcite .",
    "the latter also infer the flow to be multi - cellular and more complex .",
    "these studies motivate exploring alternative paradigms for flux transport dynamics in babcock - leighton type models of the solar cycle which are crucially dependent on meridional circulation linking the two segregated dynamo source regions in the scz .",
    "this leads us to consider the role of turbulent pumping .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      where @xmath5 i.e. the penetration depth of the latitudinal pumping .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined by the value of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "turbulent pumping profiles in the southern hemisphere are generated by replacing colatitude @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "8 ( the top and middle panels ) show that our generated turbulent pumping profiles capture the basic essence of the suggestions made by warnecke _",
    "our simulations ( with shallow meridional flow ) and the more complex turbulent pumping profile gleaned from warnecke _ et al . _",
    "( 2016 ) reproduce broad features of the solar cycle and are qualitatively similar to those detailed earlier .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that flux transport dynamo models of the solar cycle based on the babcock - leighton mechanism for poloidal field generation does not require a deep equatorward meridional plasma flow to function effectively .",
    "in fact , our results indicate that when turbulent pumping of magnetic flux is taken in to consideration , dynamo models can generate solar - like magnetic cycles even without any meridional circulation although the surface magnetic field dynamics does not reach all the way to the polar regions in this case .",
    "our conclusions are robust across a modest range of plausible parameter space for turbulent pumping coefficients and also indicate some tolerance for diverse pumping profiles .",
    "these findings have significant implications for our understanding of the solar cycle .",
    "first of all , the serious challenges that were apparently posed by observations of a shallow ( and perhaps complex , multi - cellular ) meridional flow on the very premise of flux transport dynamo models stands resolved .",
    "turbulent pumping essentially takes over the role of meridional circulation by transporting magnetic fields from the near - surface solar layers to the deep interior , ensuring that efficient recycling of toroidal and poloidal field components across the scz is not compromised . while these findings augur well for dynamo models of the solar cycle , they also imply that we need to revisit many aspects of our current understanding if indeed meridional circulation is not as effective as previously thought .",
    "for example , our simulations indicate that variations in turbulent pumping speeds can be an effective means for the modulation of solar cycle periodicity and amplitude .",
    "it has been argued earlier that the interplay between competing flux transport processes determine the dynamical memory of the solar cycle governing solar cycle predictability @xcite .",
    "if turbulent pumping is the dominant flux transport process as seems plausible based on the simulations presented herein , the cycle memory would be short and this is indeed supported by independent studies @xcite and solar cycle observations @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that on the other hand , if meridional circulation were to be the dominant flux transport process , the solar cycle memory would be relatively longer and last over several cycles .",
    "this is not borne out by observations .",
    "previous results in the context of the maintenance of solar - like dipolar parity have relied on a strong turbulent diffusion to couple the northern and southern hemispheres of the sun @xcite , or a dynamo @xmath0-effect which is co - spatial with the deep equatorward counterflow in the meridional circulation assumed in most flux transport dynamo models @xcite .",
    "however , our results indicate that turbulent pumping is equally capable of coupling the northern and southern solar hemispheres and aid in the maintenance of solar - like dipolar parity .",
    "this is in keeping with earlier , independent simulations based on a somewhat different dynamo model @xcite .",
    "most importantly , our results point out an alternative to circumventing the parker - yoshimura sign rule constraint @xcite in babcock - leighton type solar dynamos that would otherwise imply poleward propagating sunspot belts in conflict with observations .",
    "( 1992 ) and ossendrijver _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) had already pointed towards this possibility in the context of mean - field dynamo models . while a deep meridional counterflow is currently thought to circumvent this constraint and force the toroidal field belt equatorward",
    ", our results convincingly demonstrate that the latitudinal component of turbulent pumping provides a viable alternative to overcoming the parker - yoshimura sign rule in babcock - leighton models of the solar cycle ( even in the absence of meridional circulation ) .",
    "we note however that our theoretical results should not be taken as support for the existence of a shallow meridional flow , rather we point out that flux transport dynamo models of the solar cycle are equally capable for working with a shallow or non - existent meridional flow , as long as the turbulent pumping of magnetic flux is accounted for ; this is particularly viable when turbulent pumping has a dynamically important latitudinal component . taken together ,",
    "these insights suggest a plausible new paradigm for dynamo models of the solar cycle , wherein , turbulent pumping of magnetic flux effectively replaces the important roles that are currently thought to be mediated via a deep meridional circulation within the sun s interior .",
    "since the dynamical memory and thus predictability of the solar cycle depends on the dominant mode of magnetic flux transport in the sun s interior , this would also imply that physics - based prediction models of long - term space weather need to adequately include the physics of turbulent pumping of magnetic fields .",
    "we acknowledge the referee of this manuscript for useful suggestions .",
    "we thank jrn warnecke for helpful discussions related to the adaptation of the turbulent pumping profile from warnecke _ et al .",
    "we are grateful to the ministry of human resource development , council for scientific and industrial research , university grants commission of the government of india and a nasa heliophysics grand challenge grant for supporting this research .",
