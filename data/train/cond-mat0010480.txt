    "in this paper we describe a new approach to perturbation theory for systems with local moments or , in principle , any local order parameter .",
    "we begin by summarizing the present status of weak  coupling perturbation theories for such systems , with the hubbard model as a primary example .",
    "over the course of the last decade weak  coupling perturbation theories have been used extensively to investigate the physics of the hubbard model and its extensions . the simplest perturbative approach to the hubbard model",
    "is just hartree  fock theory for one  body correlation functions .",
    "the conserving approximation implied for two  body correlations is then the random phase approximation , or rpa . in the large@xmath1 limit at half  filling the static spin response is unstable within hartree  fock , and the system exhibits a broken  symmetry ground state with infinite ",
    "range antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "furthermore a gap of order @xmath1 appears in the one  body density of states for the ordered phase .",
    "if the hartree  fock equations are extended to finite temperature , long  range antiferromagnetic order onsets at a temperature of order @xmath1 in the large@xmath1 limit .",
    "the zero  temperature behavior of the hartree ",
    "fock approximation away from half  filling has also been investigated , and incommensurate states , as well as vertical and diagonal domain walls , have been studied @xcite .",
    "however , the appropriate treatment for finite temperatures has remained unclear , because the energetic competition of the various states is delicate .",
    "in fact the hartree ",
    "fock approximation at finite temperatures provides only a crude description of the physics in a two ( or one ) dimensional system . in accordance with the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem @xcite , infinite ",
    "range magnetic order is forbidden for @xmath0 in two dimensions .",
    "the magnetic correlation length @xmath2 instead diverges exponentially in @xmath3 for @xmath4 at half  filling , and the quantitative behavior of @xmath5 , as well as the zero  temperature ordered moment , is renormalized by quantum fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless the half  filled model exhibits a gap ( or _ pseudogap _ , since we do not mean to imply a rigorously zero density of states ) at finite temperature in the spin  disordered phase .    with the intention of modeling strong spin fluctuations in a disordered system , the present authors proposed the fluctuation exchange , or flex , approximation @xcite as a plausible starting point . the self  consistent treatment of spin fluctuations in the one  body self ",
    "energy suppresses the magnetic ordering transition to zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless the new approximation is itself flawed : it does not produce a sharp gap at half  filling and instead smears out the density of states , leaving a finite weight at zero energy for all temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore the spin response function diverges with decreasing temperature in a way which only roughly mirrors the exact behavior of the model .",
    "the failure at half  filling calls into question results obtained for large @xmath1 at small doping , and in the end the flex approximation fails to describe the pseudogap regime .",
    "the inadequacy of the flex approximation has motivated various attempts to improve the theory .",
    "kampf and schrieffer have calculated the electron spectral density near an antiferromagnetic transition to lowest order in an effective spin  fluctuation interaction , and their results exhibit a pseudogap when the spin correlation length is large @xcite .",
    "vilk and tremblay @xcite have introduced a factorization approximation for the electron four  point function which is constrained to be exact when all space  time coordinates coincide .",
    "others @xcite have argued that perturbative calculations based on an unrenormalized electron propagator are justified by a cancellation between vertex corrections and self  energies , leading to the appearance of a pseudogap in some parameter regimes .",
    "in addition efforts have been made to extend the flex approximation within a scheme based on infinite  order ( or `` parquet '' ) vertex renormalization @xcite .",
    "quantitative studies of parquet renormalization have had the goal of establishing the validity or inadequacy of perturbation theory resummations for systems with a gap , but without infinite  range order .",
    "why would one assume that such resummations have any chance of succeeding ?",
    "for at least one nontrivial model , the anderson impurity in a metallic host , it has been known since the mid1980 s that zero  temperature perturbation theory for thermodynamic properties has an infinite radius of convergence in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this fact , as well as some suggestive results in the low  density limit , initially encouraged hope that an infinite  order parquet summation for the doped mott insulator might succeed if the technical difficulties impeding its implementation could be overcome .",
    "in fact this hope is not justified .",
    "full numerical solutions of the minimal parquet equations for the two  dimensional hubbard model in the large@xmath1 limit @xcite yield the following results : ( i )  no gap appears in the converged solution at half filling .",
    "( ii )  the spectral density at low energies is actually larger than that in a flex calculation .",
    "we interpret these results to mean that conventional perturbation theory @xcite fails to describe the physics of a mott ",
    "hubbard gap or pseudogap in a spin  disordered system .",
    "furthermore the parquet results , which consistently incorporate vertex renormalization to infinite order , bring into question whether the basic problem can be circumvented by the constrained factorization approximation or a cancellation between parts of perturbative diagrams .",
    "rather we believe the failure of perturbation theory around a uniform ( i.e. , fermi liquid ) starting point is due to a qualitative change in the saddle  point structure of the action for the hubbard model at temperatures of order @xmath1 in the large@xmath1 limit .",
    "this change is induced by the appearance of local moments ( or , more generally speaking , a local order parameter field ) in the theory .",
    "conventional perturbation theory becomes unreliable below a temperature scale which depends on both the interaction @xmath1 and the chemical potential @xmath6 . below this scale",
    "one needs a revised perturbation theory which incorporates `` anomalous '' feynman graphs , but does so without inducing infinite ",
    "range order .",
    "these seemingly contradictory objectives may be accomplished by introducing a spatially varying static field with the full symmetry of the associated classical order parameter .",
    "one way to introduce such a field is via a stratonovich - hubbard ( s  h ) transformation @xcite of the interaction .",
    "in particular we employ below a spin  rotation ",
    "invariant s ",
    "h field to decouple the static @xmath7 component of the hubbard interaction .",

    "@xcite showed for the magnetic alloy problem that the effective static free energy induced by a time  varying s ",
    "h field provides a physical picture of the crossover from band  like to local ",
    "moment behavior .",
    "evenson et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the coupling between isolated moments which arises within this approach and noted that the simplest scheme generates an ising , rather than heisenberg , interaction .",
    "below we show that when a vector s ",
    "h field is introduced , the effective action reduces to a classical heisenberg form at half  filling .",
    "this means no infinite  range order at @xmath0 , an exponentially diverging correlation length @xmath2 , _ and _ a mott ",
    "hubbard gap in the spin  disordered phase .",
    "furthermore the approximation scheme should provide a systematic way to study doping of the mott insulator . in the doped case both orientation and amplitude fluctuations of the field become important .",
    "in particular the effective action for the static field is strongly non ",
    "gaussian @xcite .",
    "since the action arises directly from integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom , its form reflects both the underlying spin and charge structure of the system . in this way",
    "domain wall stripe fluctuations can occur naturally if they are present in the model .",
    "we describe this new approximation scheme for the hubbard model in section 2 , then derive expressions for specific electron correlation functions in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we provide a brief description of our monte carlo sampling scheme for integration over the fluctuating local fields .",
    "in section 5 we present some illustrative results obtained on a work station for a @xmath8 system .",
    "we outline in section 6 the form of generalized approximations which extend the present approach in the same sense that flex extends hartree  fock .",
    "finally we close in section 7 with some speculations on possible implications for high  temperature superconductivity and with an outline of the next steps in this work .",
    "in this section we show how to decouple the the static spin interaction in the repulsive hubbard model by introducing a spin  rotation ",
    "invariant s  h field .",
    "this field may be interpreted as a classical heisenberg order parameter which generalizes the saddle  point in conventional temperature  dependent hartree  fock calculations .",
    "it is conventional to decouple the interaction term by introducing independent fields at each point in imaginary time .",
    "when this is done , some freedom remains in choosing the form of the interaction , due to the equal  time fermion anticommutation relations .",
    "one may write equivalently un_in_i  & = &  u(n_i^2 - m_iz^2 ) [ intone1 ] + & = &  u(n_i - m_iz^2 ) [ intone2 ] + & = &  un_i -u(m_ix^2 + m_iy^2 )  , [ intone3 ] where n_i  & = &  n_i + n_i + _ i  & = &  _  c^_i_",

    "note that both these expressions imply an ising  like s  h field governing the spin degrees of freedom , while the third expression implies an xy  like field .",
    "all three expressions result in actions which break the spin  rotational symmetry of the theory , and the symmetry is only restored by the integration over field configurations .",
    "as long as all configurations are included there is no difficulty , but problems arise if approximations are introduced for any system beyond a single impurity .",
    "this was realized by evenson et al .",

    "[ intone2 ] is used as a starting point .",
    "it would clearly be desirable to introduce a symmetrical heisenberg decoupling , but this is difficult for the following reason : no matter how the spin quantization axis is chosen , the three equivalent components of the spin  spin interaction are divided up between the two particle  hole channels ( longitudinal and transverse ) of the electron vertex , which `` overlap '' completely at equal time .",
    "a heisenberg decoupling can be introduced artificially if , for example , the interaction is written as an equal  weight linear combination of eqn .",

    "we may restate the problem as follows : a conventional equal ",
    "time s  h transformation , followed by a static approximation within the resulting theory , violates the crossing symmetry of the hubbard interaction vertex and prevents a spin  rotation  invariant treatment of fluctuations . to insure an equivalent static treatment of all three spin components , we propose the introduction of a zero  frequency , rather than equal  time , s ",
    "such a decoupling scheme is possible because the static components of the direct and exchange channels in the hubbard model have essentially zero overlap at low temperatures .",
    "this allows the simultaneous treatment of interactions in both crossed channels and leads to a unique prescription for the decoupling scheme independent of the expression employed for the interaction in eqns .",
    "[ intone1]-[intone4 ] . the same procedure can be applied in more general situations when it is necessary to decouple multiple interactions in crossed channels .",
