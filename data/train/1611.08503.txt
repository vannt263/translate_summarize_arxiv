    "many mathematical models of physical phenomena deal with systems of volterra integral equations with singular kernels ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper , motivated by some nonlinear volterra integral equations arising in quantum mechanics ,",
    "we investigate the properties of convolution operators with kernels possibly more singular than the more known abel ones .",
    "namely , given a generic positive , locally integrable function @xmath0 , we study the action of the operator @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 on intervals @xmath9 $ ] , with @xmath10 ( this assumption being understood in the whole paper ) .    precisely , we prove its regularizing effect in hlder and lebesgue spaces and its `` contractive '' effect in sobolev spaces ( where with `` contractive '' we mean that the sobolev norm of @xmath11 on @xmath9 $ ] can be estimated by the norm of @xmath12 times a constant that gets smaller as @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is also worth highlighting that the assumption of local integrability of @xmath0 is the minimum requirement so that definition make sense in general .",
    "in fact , the aim of the paper ( even though some results will require additional hypothesis ) is to work with the least set of assumptions that are necessary in order to detect remarkable effects from the application of the operator @xmath3 .    a particular relevance in applications is acquired by the case @xmath14 ( figure [ fig : nu ] ) , where the operator @xmath3 reads @xmath15 we observe that , if we denote by @xmath16 the _ volterra functions _ defined by @xmath17 then @xmath18 coincides with @xmath19 , which is the so - called volterra function _ of order _ @xmath20 ( see @xcite , section 18.3 ) , that is discussed in section [ sec - volt ] .",
    "in addition , recalling that a kernel @xmath21 is said a _ sonine kernel _ if it is a divisor of the unit with respect to the convolution operation , that is , if there exists another kernel @xmath22 such that @xmath23,\\ ] ] then , one can prove that @xmath24 is a sonine kernel , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 representing the euler - mascheroni constant ( see eq . ) .",
    "the class of sonine kernels is wide and there are many papers ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , starting with the pioneering one by sonine ( @xcite ) , where embedding theorems for integral operators with kernels displaying singularities at the origin of the type @xmath27 are discussed .",
    "however , we stress that the results proved in the present paper are more general since they take into account also kernels that are more singular in a neighborhood of the origin , such as , indeed , the volterra function @xmath24 , whose asymptotyc expansion near @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 ( see ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that a first discussion on the operator @xmath30 is present in @xcite , whereas similar integral operators , but with more regular kernels , have been investigated more recently by @xcite .",
    "more in detail , in @xcite it is analyzed the case of a certain class of _ almost decreasing _ sonine kernels in terms of _ weighted generalized _ hlder spaces , while in @xcite an `` inverse '' operator is discussed within the framework of @xmath31 spaces .",
    "we also recall that in @xcite some relevant features of volterra functions are pointed out , such as asymptotic expansions and some striking relations with the ramanujan integrals .",
    "the interest of the operator @xmath30 is mainly due to its applications in quantum mechanics , and precisely in the study of the schrdinger equation with nonlinear point interactions in @xmath32 .",
    "we recall briefly that a schrdinger equation with a _ linear _ point interaction with strength @xmath33 , placed at @xmath34 , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a differential operator with domain @xmath37   \\displaystyle \\hspace{7 cm } \\lim_{{\\mathbf{x}}\\to { \\mathbf{y } } } \\phi_\\lambda({\\mathbf{x } } ) = \\left(\\alpha+\\tfrac{1}{2\\pi } \\log \\tfrac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{2 } + \\tfrac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\right)q\\bigg\\ }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] ( @xmath38 denoting the green s function of @xmath39 in @xmath32 ) and action @xmath40 for a complete discussion on the solution of this equation through the theory of self - adjoint extension , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that , given an initial datum @xmath41 , the solution of the associated cauchy problem reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the the _ propagator _ of the free schrdinger equation in @xmath32 ( with integral kernel @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( with a little abuse of notation that is usual in the literature ) is a complex - valued function satisfying the so - called _ charge _",
    "equation @xmath46 now , a _ nonlinear _",
    "point interaction arises when one assumes that the strength of the interaction depends in fact on the function @xmath45 , and in particular when one sets @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) in , thus obtaining @xmath50 ( see @xcite ) . since in the nonlinear case",
    "no theory of self - adjoint extensions is available , the relevance of the operator @xmath30 is clear : the well - posedness of the associated cauchy problem is strictly related to the study of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of , which strongly depends on the properties of @xmath30 .    even though the application presented above concerns complex - valued functions , this papers only manages real - valued functions .",
    "however , one can check that the results of section [ sob ! ] ( which are actually required in @xcite ) can be easily generalized to complex - valued functions .",
    "another topical example of integral kernels that are included in our general framework are the well known _ abel kernels _ , which correspond to the choice @xmath51 in .",
    "these ones are very important in the theory of _ fractional integration _ and _ generalized differentiation _ ( @xcite ) and , again , in quantum mechanics . in the study of nonlinear point interactions in @xmath52 and @xmath53 , indeed",
    ", the resulting integral equations present the kernel , with @xmath54 , in place of @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we describe briefly the main results of the paper .",
    "they concern , as we told at the beginning , the properties of the operator @xmath3 in hlder spaces , @xmath31 spaces and sobolev spaces .",
    "preliminarily , since it is crucial in the following , we define the integral function of the kernel @xmath0 @xmath55 since @xmath0 is always supposed positive and locally integrable , it turns out that @xmath4 is a positive , increasing and absolutely continuous function with @xmath56 as @xmath57 .    in the case of hlder spaces ,",
    "it is well known ( @xcite , theorem 4.2.1 p. 70 ) that when the kernel is @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the operator @xmath3 transforms @xmath60 functions into @xmath61 ones , improving this way the regularity of the modulus of continuity . as a consequence of our main result of section [ sectionhold ] ( theorem [ casoholder ] )",
    ", we will see that more generally the improvement is at least given by the integral function of the kernel : the phenomenon that the power @xmath62 gives as improvement the exponent @xmath63 is therefore true also for any locally integrable kernel which is assumed just equivalent to a decreasing function in a neighborhood of the origin and not blowing too much ( derivative bounded above , for instance ) in its domain",
    ".    in the case of @xmath31 spaces , it is well known ( @xcite , theorem 4.1.4 p. 67 ) that when the kernel is @xmath58 , the operator @xmath3 transforms @xmath64 functions , @xmath65 , into @xmath66 functions . to a minor integrability of the kernel",
    "corresponds a minor gain of integrability for @xmath67 , and apparently the gain disappears when the kernel is just @xmath68 . as a consequence of our main result of section [ sectionellepi ] ( theorem [ casolp ] ) , we will show that _ any kernel locally integrable ( again , we assume that it is equivalent to a decreasing function in a neighborhood of the origin ) gives an improvement of integrability , measured in terms of orlicz spaces . the improvement is strictly linked to the orlicz integrability of the kernel , hence it always exists : a classical , remarkable theorem in orlicz spaces theory ( see e.g. @xcite , p. 60 ) tells that any function @xmath68 is always in some orlicz space strictly contained in @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , in the case @xmath69 , we show ( proposition [ pro : infinity ] ) , under the unique assumption of local integrability , that @xmath3 transforms @xmath70 functions in continuous functions and that the @xmath70 norm of @xmath11 on @xmath9 $ ] is controlled by the norm of @xmath12 times @xmath71 .",
    "_    finally , in the case of sobolev spaces , it is well known ( @xcite , theorem 4.2.2 p. 73 ) that when the kernel is @xmath58 , the operator @xmath3 transforms @xmath72 functions , with @xmath73 , in @xmath74 functions .",
    "analogous results for @xmath75 functions are discussed in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the minor integrability of the kernel yields a minor gain in the sobolev index , which disappears when the kernel is just @xmath68 ( also the preservation of the index is not straightforward ) . as a consequence of our main result of section",
    "[ sob ! ] ( theorem [ contr_lemma ] ) , we will show that when @xmath76 , provided @xmath77 , the sobolev index is in fact preserved and the sobolev norm of @xmath11 is bounded , up to a multiplicative constant , by the norm of @xmath12 times @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , we will prove that ( almost ) the same result holds for @xmath78 functions , but just in the case @xmath79 ( theorem [ contr_lemma_2 ] ) , and for @xmath80 functions ( theorem [ contr_lemma_3 ] ) .",
    "since the case of a kernel equal to the volterra function @xmath24 ( defined by , figure [ fig : nu ] ) is the most relevant in the applications , it is worth stressing some basic features of @xmath24 . in this way",
    "one can easily see that the abstract results established in the following sections can be actually applied to this kernel .",
    "first , we recall ( see @xcite ) that @xmath24 is analytic for @xmath82 and that @xmath83 , & \\quad\\text{as } x\\to 0\\\\[1 cm ]   \\displaystyle { \\mathcal{i}}(x ) = e^{x}+\\mathcal{o}(x^{-1 } ) ,                                                                           & \\quad\\text{as } x\\to + \\infty . \\end{array}\\ ] ] consequently , the first expansion shows that @xmath84 and that @xmath85 , for any @xmath86 .",
    "is in black , the plot of the first order of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath18 around 0 is dotted.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    also the derivative and the integral function of @xmath24 will play a crucial role in the sequel .",
    "hence , recalling ( see again @xcite ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we stress that @xmath89\\ ] ] and that @xmath90 furthermore , we can state the following lemma .    [ lem : conv ] the function @xmath24 is convex on @xmath91 and admits a positive minimum .",
    "the second part is immediate since @xmath24 is continuous , positive and coercive by . on the other hand , in order to prove the second part , it is sufficient to show @xmath92 ; namely , by , that @xmath93 .",
    "now , following @xcite ( eq . ( 3.1 ) ) and",
    "@xcite , we find that @xmath94 denotes the _ ramanujan _ function ( figure [ fig : erre ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath95 and , since @xmath96 is _ completely monotonic _",
    "( i.e. , for every @xmath97 , @xmath98 does exist and @xmath99 ) , this entails that @xmath93 and thus that @xmath24 is convex .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is also convenient to introduce the function @xmath100 ( figure [ fig : enne ] ) . by the properties of @xmath81 , we see that @xmath101 is positive , increasing and absolutely continuous on bounded intervals intervals .",
    "moreover , @xmath102 as @xmath57 , and precisely @xmath103     around zero , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one easily sees that , as one sets @xmath79 in , @xmath4 is equal to @xmath101 . on the other hand , from one",
    "also notes that @xmath101 coincides , up to an additive constant , with @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we point out a relevant property of the operator @xmath30 defined by , which is strictly connected to the fact that @xmath24 is a sonine kernel .",
    "first , define the integral operator @xmath105 then , one notes that , as @xmath106 , @xmath107 is well defined for each function @xmath108 . in addition , one can prove the following result .    [ pro : i_identity ] if @xmath109 , then @xmath110.\\ ] ]    we first observe that one has @xmath111 in @xcite , lemma 32.1 , it is indeed claimed that ( setting @xmath112 therein ) @xmath113 with @xmath114 , and since from @xmath115 , is proved .",
    "now , in the expression @xmath116 we exchange the order of the integration , since @xmath117     \\displaystyle = \\int_0^{x } \\int_0^{x } { \\mathcal{i}}(s ) \\phi(|x-\\sigma - s| ) g(\\sigma)ds\\,d\\sigma = 2   \\int_0^{x } \\int_0^{x - s } { \\mathcal{i}}(s ) \\phi(|x-\\sigma - s| ) g(\\sigma)d\\sigma\\,ds ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] and using , we conclude that @xmath118 finally , given that an easy change of variable shows @xmath119 , the proof is complete .",
    "we note that , in view of theorem [ contr_lemma_3 ] , if one also assumes @xmath120 in proposition [ pro : i_identity ] , then @xmath121",
