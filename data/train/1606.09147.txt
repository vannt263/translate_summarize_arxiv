    "in this paper , we study universal polynomials of characteristic classes associated to @xmath0-classification theory of holomorphic map - germs @xmath5 in low dimensions .",
    "our aim is to apply them to classical enumerative geometry . in the singularity theory of maps , it is natural to identify two map - germs if they coincide through suitable local coordinate changes of the source and the target , that is called the _",
    "@xmath0-equivalence _ of map - germs .",
    "a map - germ is called to be _ stable _ if any deformation of the germ is ( parametrically ) @xmath0-equivalent to the trivial one , and a holomorphic map @xmath6 between complex manifolds is _ locally stable _ if the germ of @xmath7 at any point @xmath8 is stable . to each @xmath0-singularity type of map - germs , one can assign a unique universal polynomial in chern classes , called the _",
    "thom polynomial _",
    "@xcite ; it is defined by the @xmath0-equivariant poincar dual to the @xmath0-orbit closure in the space of all map - germs @xmath5 . as a typical example , for the stable singularity type @xmath9 ( crosscap ) of map - germ @xmath10 , the thom polynomial is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "this counts the number of crosscaps in a given locally stable map from a surface into a @xmath3-fold  precisely saying , for any locally stable map @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 evaluated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 expresses the homology class of the @xmath18-singularity locus of @xmath7 in @xmath19 .",
    "thom polynomials of stable singularity types of maps have been well studied ( see fehr - rimnyi @xcite , kazarian @xcite ) , while those of _ unstable _",
    "@xmath0-singularity types have been little known so far .",
    "our first purpose is to compute thom polynomials for the @xmath0-classification of ( unstable ) @xmath0-simple map - germs    @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22    in low codimensions ( theorem [ main_thm ] ) . to compute the precise form of thom polynomials , we use an effective method due to r. rimnyi @xcite , called _ restriction _ or",
    "_ interpolation method _ , and indeed it works well for singularities of low codimension ( remark [ quasi_homog ] ) . for instance , for @xmath0-types @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , their thom polynomials are given by , e.g. @xmath25 such a local singularity of maps generically appears in families of maps , and hence the associated characteristic class expresses the degeneracy locus of that type ; this is regarded as a _ non - linear version _ of the famous thom - porteous formula for degeneracy loci of vector bundle morphisms @xcite .",
    "precisely , it is described as follows .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be holomorphic fiber bundles over a complex manifold @xmath28 with fiber @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath31 be a holomorphic map from an open neighborhoods of the zero section @xmath32 to @xmath27 so that @xmath31 identifies the zero sections , @xmath33 , and the following diagram commutes : @xmath34 that is , @xmath31 defines a family of holomorphic map - germs @xmath35 parametrized by points of @xmath28 analytically .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the locus consisting of @xmath8 at which the germ @xmath37 is @xmath0-equivalent to a given type @xmath38 , and it becomes a locally closed subvariety of @xmath28 .",
    "then , for an appropriately generic @xmath31 , the closure of the @xmath39-locus is universally expressed by @xmath40=tp_{\\mathcal{a}}(\\eta)(c(e ) , c(f))\\in h^*(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the chern classes of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ( theorem [ thm : a - classification ] )",
    ".    we apply these universal polynomials to enumerative problems in classical algebraic geometry .",
    "as it is dealt in old literatures , e.g. salmon @xcite , baker @xcite , semple - roth @xcite , or reformulated within modern intersection theory in piene @xcite ( also kleiman @xcite ) , it is a typical question to seek for formulae of numerical characters of a given projective surface ; for instance , polar classes are indeed defined by the critical loci of general linear projections , so those should directly be connected with thom polynomials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , richer structures in local extrinsic geometry of embedded surfaces in projective or affine spaces have been re - explored as an application of @xmath0-classification theory of map - germs @xcite ; for instance , the contact of a line with a given surface is measured by the @xmath0-equivalence type of its projection along the line . from this context , we study a counting problem of lines having some prescribed contact with an embedded surface .",
    "first , we rediscover classical formulae of salmon - cayley - zeuthen for smooth surfaces in @xmath43 and generalize them to the case of surfaces with ordinary singularities ( theorem [ dct ] , remark [ kulikov ] ) .",
    "the same approach is also applied to smooth surfaces in @xmath44 ( theorem [ dct2 ] ) ; seemingly , this case was not well examined in old literatures .",
    "indeed , the contact of lines has been studied rather recently by using the @xmath0-classification of map - germs @xmath45 in d. mond s thesis @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) .",
    "let @xmath28 be an appropriately generic surface in @xmath44 ; the projection along almost all tangent lines @xmath46 is of crosscap @xmath18 , while along the asymptotic line , the projection is of type @xmath47 or worse ; in particular , the @xmath48-singularity and the @xmath49-singularity occur on curves on @xmath28 and these two curves meet each other tangentially at some discrete points where the @xmath50-singularity appears in the projection ( that is an analogy to the _ cusp of gauss _ on a surface in @xmath3-space ) .",
    "our concern is to compute the degree of such special loci on @xmath28 .",
    "to each pair @xmath51 with @xmath8 and @xmath52 , we associate the germ at @xmath53 of the projection of @xmath28 along @xmath46 to a hyperplane @xmath54 transverse to @xmath46 passing through @xmath53 , that yields a family of holomorphic map - germs @xmath55 over the flag manifold of pairs @xmath56 .",
    "we then apply @xmath57 to the family @xmath31 , and push it down to the ambient @xmath44 to get the desired enumeration . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath28 is a smooth complete intersection of degrees @xmath58 and @xmath59 in @xmath44 , the degree given by @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 ( that is obvious , because at every general point @xmath8 there are exactly two asymptotic lines ) ; the degrees of loci of types @xmath62 are now easily given by @xmath63    our method produces a bunch of enumerative formulae of this kind , and actually most of those are new . rather than such formulae ,",
    "the main point is to propose a general framework based on singularity theory for certain enumerative problems .",
    "we emphasize that there are a number of different objects in projective algebraic geometry to which the @xmath0-classification of map - germs can suitably be applied , e.g. , osculating planes of a space curve , subspaces having a prescribed contact with a hypersurface , singular points of a scroll , singularities of the focal surface associated to a line congruence or a line complex , and so on ; it would be promising to develop classical works on enumerations of such objects by means of our universal polynomials .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be holomorphic fiber bundles over a complex manifold @xmath28 with fibers @xmath29 , @xmath30 and zero sections @xmath32 , @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "a _ holomorphic family of map - germs _ @xmath67 is defined to be the germ at @xmath32 of a holomorphic map @xmath68 from an open neighborhood @xmath69 of @xmath32 to @xmath27 so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in fact , a weaker notion is sufficient for our purpose ; we say that @xmath31 a _ continuous family of holomorphic map - germs _ if @xmath68 is continuous and the restriction @xmath72 to each fiber is holomorphic . for simplicity , we work with holomorphic families of map - germs , unless specifically mentioned .    a holomorphic map @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) canonically induces a holomorphic family @xmath31 of map - germs from @xmath76 to @xmath77 which corresponds to the map @xmath78 it may be given by the germ at the diagonal of @xmath79 with projections to the second factors .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the jet space of holomorphic map - germs @xmath83 over all @xmath84 , that is , @xmath85 given an @xmath86-invariant subset @xmath87 , there is an associated subbundle @xmath88 in @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath89-jet extension @xmath90 _ is naturally defined by assiging @xmath91 to @xmath8 , and then put @xmath92 .",
    "we say that @xmath31 is _ admissible _ with respect to @xmath39 if the equality @xmath40=j^r\\varphi^*({\\textup{\\textrm{dual}\\,}}[\\overline{\\eta(e , f)}])\\ ] ] holds .",
    "for instance , when @xmath93 is transverse to ( a whitney stratification of ) the closure @xmath94 , @xmath31 is admissible .",

    ", we briefly give a proof , although it is straightforward from the definition @xcite .",
    "there are the classifying maps @xmath97 and @xmath98 for linealized bundles ( as topological vector bundles ) @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , so that the pullback of chern classes @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the universal vector bundles @xmath103 are just @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ". put @xmath106 , and let @xmath107 denote the universal fiber bundles with fiber @xmath108 and structure group @xmath109 .",
    "the jet bundle has the subbundle @xmath110 with fiber @xmath39 ; then we can define @xmath111\\ ] ] in the cohomology which is canonically isomorphic to @xmath112\\otimes{\\mathbb{z}}[c'_1,\\cdots , c'_{n } ] = { \\mathbb{z}}[\\bc , \\bc']\\ ] ] via the pullback of the projection @xmath113 .",
    "put @xmath114 , and @xmath115 the bundle homomorphism over @xmath116 . by the above construction , @xmath117=\\bar{\\rho}^*{\\textup{\\textrm{dual}\\,}}\\ , [ \\overline{\\eta(\\xi_1 , \\xi_2)}].\\ ] ] hence @xmath118 & = j\\varphi^*({\\textup{\\textrm{dual}\\,}}\\ , [ \\overline{\\eta(e , f ) } ] ) = j\\varphi^*\\bar{\\rho}^*{\\textup{\\textrm{dual}\\,}}\\ , [ \\overline{\\eta(\\xi_1 , \\xi_2 ) } ] \\\\ & = \\rho^*tp_{\\mathcal{a}}(\\eta)(\\bc , \\bc ' ) = tp_{\\mathcal{a}}(\\eta)(c(e ) , c(f)).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath6 is _ locally stable _ if and only if the jet extension @xmath119 is transverse to any @xmath0-orbits ; it is also equivalent to that @xmath119 is transverse to any @xmath120-orbits .",
    "thom polynomials for @xmath120-orbits ( or @xmath0-orbits of stable germs ) have particularly simpler forms as follows .",
    "let @xmath121 denote the @xmath122-th term of @xmath123 .    for a stable singularity type @xmath124",
    ", @xmath125 is a polynomial in the quotient chern class @xmath121 ; we write it simply by @xmath126 . in particular , for any locally stable map @xmath6",
    ", the @xmath39-singularity locus is expressed by the polynomial in @xmath127 .               since we assume that @xmath28 is smooth ,",
    "any projection has singularities of corank at most @xmath139 , so @xmath140 is zero .",
    "also a computation shows that the degree of the pushforward of @xmath141 is equal to @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , there are exactly six degenerate asymptotic lines at any general points @xmath8 ( lines having at least @xmath4-point contact with the hypersurface ) ; all asymptotic lines at @xmath53 form a conic in @xmath143 , and moreover , degenerate asymptotic lines are given by one more equation of degree three ( cubical form of the monge form ) , thus by the bezot theorem , generically six solutions are there .",
