    "the spread of disease has been one of the focuses in the field of statistical physics for many years .",
    "the dynamical behavior of so - called susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model and susceptible- infected- removed ( sir ) model have been widely investigated on regular network and complex networks[1 - 12 ] . within the studying ,",
    "individuals are modeled as sites and possible contacts between individuals are linked by edges between the sites .",
    "it is easy to see that both the properties of disease and topological character of network determine the dynamics of the spread of disease .",
    "studies have showed that there is an epidemic threshold @xmath0 on regular networks .",
    "if the effective spreading rate @xmath1@xmath2 , the infection spreads and becomes endemic ; otherwise the infection will die out . while the threshold disappears on scale - free networks[4 ] .",
    "usually , infectious diseases , such as hiv and computer virus , have the similar spreading property .",
    "they not only can spread in one household , but also can spread from one household to another . to study this spreading character ,",
    "there have been of considerable interests to epidemic models spreading among a community of households[12 - 17 ] .",
    "these studies were concerned with sir model , which can not appear endemic behavior .  in 1999",
    ", ball introduced the sis household - structure model[18 ] , in which the population is partitioned into @xmath3 households with @xmath4 members in each household .",
    "a threshold parameter @xmath5 was defined .",
    "it is shown that for the household with @xmath6 members , if @xmath7 then the epidemic die out ; if @xmath8 the epidemic will exist at an endemic equilibrium.this model has also been studied on homogeneous network by the mean of self - consistent field[19,20 ] .",
    "the similar results have been obtained .",
    "these previous studies about household - structure epidemic model were mainly on regular networks .",
    "however , studies have showed that a large number of systems , such as internet , world - wide - web , physical , biological , and social networks , exhibit complex topological properties[21 - 23 ] . in particular , small - world properties[24 ] and scale - free degree distributions[25 ]",
    "appear in many real network systems . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the sis household - structure epidemic model on complex networks .",
    "the outline is as follows : 1 ) introduction ; 2 ) description of the model ; 3 ) mean - field equations ; 4 ) steady - state solutions ; 5 ) simulation ; 6 ) summary .",
    "in complex networks with degree distribution @xmath9 , which is the probability that a given site has @xmath10 connections ( links ) that connect it with other @xmath10 sites ( we say that the given site degree is @xmath10 . ) , there are @xmath4 individuals that are grouped as a household on every site .",
    "we assume that these n individuals contact each other fully .",
    "a healthy individual may get infected from within the household and from outside its household . the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath11 are the infection rates from outside and from within the household respectively .",
    "we give each site @xmath12 a number @xmath13)$ ] , which means that there are @xmath14 infected individuals in the household at site @xmath12 .",
    "the number of infected individuals at a given site @xmath12 changes according to the following transition rates :    @xmath15 at rate @xmath16    @xmath17 at rate @xmath18 for @xmath19    @xmath20 at rate @xmath21 for @xmath22    in the above expressions @xmath23means that site @xmath12 and site @xmath24 are nearest neighbors , and we suppose there is a ( connection ) link between them",
    ". infected individuals may infect healthy individuals in their household with rate @xmath25and also can infect healthy individuals in their nearest neighbors with rate @xmath26we assume that once a site is infected , infections within the site are much more likely than infections from outside , so we can neglect the latter . and also , an infected individual in a site can recover with rate @xmath27we suppose that all the individuals in a household have the same external connectivity and do not take the birth and death into account .",
    "we now solve the above model with mean - field method .",
    "let @xmath28 be the density of individuals whose household has @xmath14 infected individuals and the corresponding site s degree is @xmath10 , which means this site has @xmath10 nearest neighbors .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath29 . according to the transitions rate described in the above  section , the evolution equations of @xmath28are written as below[4,6 ] :    @xmath30 ) \\label{g3 } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_{k , n}(t)}{\\partial t } & = & ( n-1)\\beta u_{k , n-1}-\\gamma u_{k , n } \\label{g4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in equations([g1])-([g4 ] ) , @xmath31 is the probability that a link from a site points to another site with at least one infected individual . and",
    "the expression of @xmath31 is :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the probability that a site with @xmath10 degrees points to another site with @xmath34 degrees . for uncorrelated networks",
    "the expression of @xmath33 is[7]:@xmath35    substituting ( [ pk ] ) to ( [ theta ] ) , we get @xmath36 independent of @xmath10:@xmath37    now we are going to get steady solutions of eqs.([g1])-([g4 ] )",
    "the evolution equations are simplified as :    @xmath38    in eq.([g9 ] ) , we have used the equality : @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then the steady - state solutions are:@xmath43    substituting ( [ u21])and ( [ u22 ] ) to ( [ theta2 ] ) , we get the self - consistent equation of @xmath44:@xmath45    clearly , @xmath46 is a solution of eq.([theta3 ] ) , which implies that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a steady - state solution of eqs.([g9 ] ) and ( [ g7 ] ) .",
    "a nonzero steady - state solution @xmath44 ( that is : @xmath50 , for @xmath51 ) is obtained when @xmath52 , @xmath11 and @xmath53 satisfy the following inequality :    @xmath54    then we can get the spreading threshold:@xmath55where @xmath56 , @xmath57 . in other words ,",
    "the disease will die out when @xmath58 ; otherwise the disease will pervade the system . clearly , the threshold @xmath2 is the function of @xmath11 , @xmath21 and @xmath59 .",
    "so the degree distribution of networks plays an important role on @xmath2 .    for @xmath60 ,",
    "the network is homogeneous and @xmath61 .",
    "we can lift @xmath62to prevent infection in terms of increasing the recover rate @xmath21 or decreasing the site degree @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 @xmath65)$ ] ,",
    "the networks are scale - free[19 ] . when @xmath66 , @xmath67 , the threshold is absent .",
    "this fact implies that for any positive value of @xmath53 the infection can pervade the system , which is the same as the standard sis model[4 ] .",
    "[ [ n2 ] ] n2 ~~    let @xmath68 .",
    "suppose @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "considering @xmath71then eqs.([g1])-([g4 ] ) can be written as:@xmath72    the matrix * s * is :     @xmath73    since @xmath74 , so @xmath75 exists .",
    "thus:@xmath76    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79    from ( [ matrixs ] ) , we get @xmath80:@xmath81    substituting ( [ g17 ] ) and ( [ g16 ] ) to ( [ theta2 ] ) , we get the self - consistent equation of @xmath44:@xmath82    that is:@xmath83    obviously , @xmath46 is a solution of eq.([g18 ] ) .",
    "in addition , a non - zero solution with @xmath84 and @xmath50 @xmath85 is allowed if the following inequality holds:@xmath86    that is:@xmath87    from ( [ g20 ] ) , we get the epidemic threshold:@xmath88where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is an increasing function of @xmath4 and @xmath52 , but a decreasing function of the recover rate @xmath52 .",
    "so the epidemic threshold is determined by three parameters@xmath91 and the networks degree distribution @xmath9 .",
    "we notice that the expression ( [ g21 ] ) involves multiplication of the well - known term @xmath92[2,4,6,9 ] , which is closely related to the `` average '' number of secondary infections[7,8 ] .",
    "not surprising , this result is the same as that of the standard sis model[4 ] .    for @xmath60 ,",
    "the network is homogeneous",
    ". then @xmath93 , we can increase the recover rate @xmath52 or decrease the site degree @xmath63 and the size of the household @xmath4 to lift @xmath94to prevent the infectious disease from spreading . for large @xmath4",
    "the threshold is very small .    for @xmath64 @xmath65)$ ] ,",
    "the network is scale - free[21 ] . when @xmath66 , @xmath67 , then @xmath95 .",
    "so the threshold is absent for scale - free network .",
    "this implies that for any positive value of @xmath53 , the infection can pervade the system even with high recover rate .",
    "in above section , we have given the analytical result of the sis model with household structure .",
    "we find that for regular network there is an epidemic threshold @xmath2 ; while for scale - free network the threshold disappears . for comparison",
    ", we simulate the model on regular network(see fig[fig1 ] ) and on scale free network(see fig[fig2 ] ) respectively . for simplicity(without lack of generality ) , we set @xmath96 , @xmath97 . in fig.1",
    ", we plot the fraction of infected individuals in the stationary state , @xmath98 , for different values of @xmath11 on regular network with @xmath99 . obviously , there is a threshold @xmath2 for each @xmath11 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "@xmath2 is @xmath101 , in agreement with the corresponding analytical result , @xmath102 , which can be obtained from([g21 ] ) . only when @xmath1 is increased above @xmath2 is a significant prevalence observed . in fig.2 , we plot the fraction of infected individuals in the stationary state , @xmath98 , for different values of @xmath11 on scale - free network with @xmath103 .",
    "we observe that@xmath104 is absent . in contract with the standard sis model ,",
    "of which the prevalence , @xmath98 , increases slowly when increasing @xmath1[24 ] , our current epidemic model exhibits that @xmath98 increases rapidly with @xmath53 .",
    "in this work , we analyze the sis model that incorporates social household . we have focused on the impaction of geometrical property of complex networks and on the role of several parameters in the spreading threshold .",
    "results show that the large household size n and the high within household infection rate are more likely to cause the spread of disease .",
    "but it s worth noticing that , even when local recovery rate is greater than effective infection rate , in divergent networks such as scale - free network , disease still can spread !",
    "this results tell us that even the local recover condition is good enough to give local protection , there are still some probability for a wide range disease spreading .",
    "it seems that this phenomenon can only exist in divergent networks with household structure .",
    "maybe this imply that we have to care about the network structure much more than recover condition during disease spreading .",
    "of course , the model we have studied seems more ideal .",
    "for example , we have supposed that the existence of the n - member households do not affect the property of the complex networks , and also we do not take the move of the individuals into account .",
    "however , the result tells us that the properties of the complex networks play the most important role in the epidemic spreading .",
