    "this finding indicates that the created qgp behaves as a nearly perfect fluid with a small value of the shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio , @xmath2 , which was confirmed by non - ideal hydrodynamic analysis of these data  @xcite .",
    "it was claimed  @xcite that a new state produced at high temperatures is most likely not a weakly interacting qgp , as it was originally assumed , but a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",

    "this is true in the presence of soft slowly relaxing collective modes .",

    "in this paper , we analyzed different approximations for the calculation of the shear and the bulk viscosities for the hadron and the quark - gluon phases .",
    "general expressions for shear and bulk viscosities are derived in the relaxation - time approximation for a system described by the quasipartcle relativistic mean - field theory with the scaling of hadron masses and couplings ( shmc ) .",

    "the high - energy flattening of the @xmath318 dependence occurs at quite low @xmath427 .",
    "it implies that a small value of @xmath2 required for explaining a large elliptic flow observed at rhic could be reached in the hadronic phase .",
    "this might be an important observation which we have demonstrated within the shmc and the ideal gas ( ig ) models with the same hadron set . the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ratios at the freeze - out curve calculated within the shmc and ig models agree with each other ; however , rough estimates @xcite of @xmath2 extracted from comparison of dynamical model calculations with experimental data overshoot these theoretical expectations by a factor of 2 - 5 . note that rapid processes at the freeze out may result in an additional increase of the viscosities and the entropy production .",
    "these effects are not incorporated directly in the present consideration but the use of experimental freeze - out temperature and chemical potential allows one to hope that indirectly they are effectively included .    using the gibbs conditions we extended our approach to higher temperatures combining the shmc model description of the hadron phase with that of the heavy quark bag ( hqb ) model for the quark - gluon phase .",

    "moreover one might be need to improve the model in order to include possibility of the crossover for @xmath91 . not considered in our work these effects require a special careful analysis .    in the two - phase shmc - hqb model with the first order phase transition",
    "there appears a jump in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the critical temperature at any @xmath86 . for @xmath144 at @xmath429 , @xmath2 grows with increase of the temperature , whereas @xmath3 approximately stays constant .",
    "the magnitude of both ratios differs significantly from those estimated in the njl model @xcite .",
    "comparison of our approach with the njl model @xcite demonstrates that behavior of transport coefficients near the critical point depends on the type of the phase transition .",
    "it is worthy to note that the @xmath6 analysis  @xcite indicates different values of @xmath2 for peripheral and central collisions .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to perform hydrodynamical calculations using the @xmath134 dependent transport coefficients rather than constant ones .",
    "necessity of such an approach was recently emphasized in  @xcite . in subsequent works we plan to use the shmc model eos with the derived transport coefficients for this purpose .",
    "we also estimated influence of the finite width effects on the transport coefficients .",
    "for this aim we evaluated the shear viscosity and the entropy density at non - zero width .",
    "our findings show that width effects are important for low temperatures ( for @xmath430 mev ) , whereas for higher temperatures one may use the quasiparticle approximation .",
    "as was demonstrated in  @xcite the @xmath3 ratio may have a sharp maximum at the critical point .",
    "this statement is based on the assumption of the existence of soft collective modes at temperatures near @xmath5 .",
    "the enhancement of the ratio @xmath3 near the critical point could have interesting consequences  @xcite , provided the system evolves very slowly .",
    "however it is unlikely that in the course of relativistic heavy ion collisions the system spends enough time in the vicinity of the critical point to develop slow soft collective modes , see  @xcite .",
    "moreover effective hadron masses responsible for the softness of the modes , being calculated within our shmc model , although decrease toward the critical point do not drop to zero . thus the quasiparticle - like collisional viscosity estimates look more relevant than those follow from the consideration of the slow soft mode dynamics .",
