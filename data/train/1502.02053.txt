    "snell index_.    in nature , the indices of refraction of all materials are positive . recently , however , physicists have created media that have negative indices of refraction , called `` metamaterials . ''",
    "articles describing this discovery were published in _ science _",
    "@xcite,@xcite , and have been cited thousands of times in the 10 years since .",
    "even with standard materials with positive indices of refraction , it is possible to do counterintuitive things like make glass `` disappear '' by immersing it in clear oil . since metamaterials are not found in nature , we have even less intuition for their effects .",
    "when light crosses a boundary between a medium with a positive index of refraction and one with a negative index of refraction , the light bends in the opposite direction as it would if both media had positive indices of refraction .",
    "these new materials may someday be used to create an invisibility shield , improve solar panel technology , or fabricate a perfect lens that would be able to resolve details even smaller than the wavelengths of light used to create the image , see @xcite .    the behavior in complex scenarios , such as the propagation of light through materials that alternate between standard materials and metamaterials , is complex and interesting .",
    "motivated by this new discovery in physics , we introduce and study a new billard - type dynamical system .",
    "we formulate a model for light passing between two media with refraction coefficient @xmath5 , which we call _ tiling billiards _ , defined as follows :    1 .",
    "we consider a partition of the plane into regions ( a _ tiling _ ) .",
    "we give a reflection rule for a beam of light passing through the tiling : when light hits a boundary , it is reflected across the boundary .",
    "if the light hits a corner , the subsequent trajectory is undefined .",
    "an example of a tiling billiards trajectory is in figure [ tilebill ] .    [ !",
    "h ]     to relate this model to the physical system with standard materials and metamaterials , we consider a two - colorable tilling of the plane , where one color corresponds to a material with index of refraction @xmath6 , and the other color to a material with index @xmath7 .",
    "however , the dynamical system described above need not obey this restriction .",
    "note that this problem is @xmath8-dimensional , in the sense that the width of a parallel beam of light is preserved .",
    "although the tiling billiards system is new , it has many similarities to the well - studied dynamical systems of inner and outer billiards . in the _ inner billiards _ dynamical system",
    ", we consider a billiard table with a ball bouncing around inside , where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at each bounce . in the _ outer billiards _ dynamical system ,",
    "the ball is outside the table , and reflects along a tangent line to the table ( or through a vertex of a polygonal table ) , so that the original distance from the ball to the reflection point is equal to the distance from the reflection point to the image , see @xcite .",
    "in tiling billiards , the ray is reflected across the boundary .",
    "examples of inner and outer billiards are in figure [ three - billiards ] .    [ ! h ]     for any billiard system , there are several basic questions to ask .",
    "we outline these below based on the results from established literature on inner and outer billiards .",
    "_ are there periodic trajectories ?",
    "_    in inner billiards on a rational polygon ( a polygonal table where every angle is a rational multiple of @xmath9 ) , there are always periodic paths @xmath10 in fact , masur @xcite showed that periodic directions are dense . for general polygons ,",
    "it is not known whether there is always a periodic path , but schwartz @xcite showed that for in inner billiards on a _ triangle _ whose largest angle is less than @xmath11 , there is always a periodic trajectory .",
    "every polygonal outer billiard has a periodic orbit , and for outer billiards on a polygon whose vertices are at lattice points , all of the orbits are periodic , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ can trajectories escape ? _    for a finite billiard table",
    ", an inner billiard trajectory can not escape .",
    "after the outer billiards system was introduced by b.h .",
    "neumann , it stood as an open question for decades whether there are billiard tables with unbounded orbits , with many negative answers for special cases .",
    "finally , schwartz @xcite discovered that the penrose kite has unbounded orbits , and dolgopyat and fayad @xcite discovered the same for the half disk .",
    "_ can a trajectory fill a region densely ? _    in inner billiards on a square table ,",
    "a trajectory with an irrational slope is dense .",
    "it is also possible to construct a table so that some trajectory on that table is dense in one part of the table , but never visits another part of the table at all , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for outer billiards , genin @xcite showed that for certain trapezoids , there are trajectories that are dense in open regions of the plane .    _ is the behavior stable under small perturbations of the starting point and direction of the trajectory , and under small perturbations of the billiard table ?",
    "_    in inner billiards on a square table , the behavior of the trajectory depends on the direction : directions with rational slope yield periodic trajectories , and with irrational slope yield dense trajectories , so a small perturbation changes everything .",
    "similarly , a small perturbation of the polygon taking the square to a nearby quadrilateral with different angles yields very different behavior of the trajectory .",
    "so inner billiards are generally highly sensitive to the starting conditions , and in this sense are not stable . however ,",
    "if the angles of the polygon are independent over the rationals , then every periodic trajectory is stable , see @xcite .",
    "outer billiards are also unstable under perturbation of the table ; for instance , outer billiards on a kite has an unbounded orbit if and only if the kite is irrational , see @xcite .",
    "in contrast , outer billiards are quite stable under perturbation of the trajectory direction : if one point yields a periodic trajectory , that point lies in a polygonal region of points that do the same thing .",
    "_ is the behavior invariant under affine transformations ? _    because the inner billiards system uses angles , it is highly sensitive to affine transformations ; inner billiards on a rectangular table is equivalent to that of a square table , but inner billiards on a general parallelogram is completely different .",
    "because the outer billiards system uses lengths , it is invariant under affine transformations since length ratios are preserved : the dynamics on any parallelogram are the same as the dynamics on a square , and the dynamics on every triangle are the same .      tiling billiards is a cross between the inner and outer billiards systems , in the sense that in inner billiards , the ray is reflected across the normal to the boundary ; in outer billiards , the ray itself forms a tangent to the boundary and is reflected through the point of tangency ; and in tiling billiards , the light ray is reflected across the tangent to the boundary ( or the boundary itself if it is polygonal ) .",
    "an example of the tiling billiard is seen in figure [ penrose ] .    [ !",
    "h ]     much of the literature focuses on polygonal billiards . for the tiling billiards system",
    ", we study analogous tilings of the plane . in this paper , we study the case where the plane is divided by lines into regions ( possibly of infinite area ) .",
    "such a tiling is always two - colorable , because finitely many lines intersect at any point , and every vertex has an even valence , so the associated adjacency graph of the regions contains no odd cycles , and is thus bipartite . within this case , we study the three special cases where the plane is divided by a finite number of lines , where the resulting tiling is of congruent triangles with @xmath12 meeting at each vertex , and where the resulting tiling is of alternating regular hexagons and triangles ( the _ trihexagonal _ tiling ) .    based on our results , we outline the answers to several basic questions about tiling billiards below .    _",
    "are there periodic trajectories ?",
    "_    we study several special cases of the tiling billiards system , and find periodic trajectories in every one .",
    "for example , every triangle tiling has a periodic trajectory of period @xmath12 around a vertex ( corollary [ all - triangles ] ) , and almost all have a period-@xmath13 trajectory around 2 vertices ( theorem [ per10 ] ) .",
    "can trajectories escape ? _",
    "we show that every right triangle tiling has an unbounded trajectory ( theorem [ bisecting ] ) . in tiling billiards on tilings with translational symmetry",
    ", we frequently have a type of very regular escaping trajectory , which we call a _ drift - periodic _ trajectory : it is not periodic , but is periodic up to translation , like a staircase .",
    "we show that some right triangle tilings have drift - periodic trajectories ( theorem [ dper ] ) , and based on computer experiments we conjecture that they all do .",
    "we prove the existence of several families of drift - periodic trajectories on the trihexagonal tiling , and based on computer experiments we conjecture that there are non - periodic escaping trajectories as well .",
    "we also study arrangements of finitely many lines in the plane , all of which trivially have escaping trajectories that reflect only once , and some of which have trajectories that escape by spiraling outward .",
    "_ can a trajectory fill a region densely ? _",
    "we show that the trihexagonal tiling has trajectories that fill regions of the plane densely ( theorem [ dense ] ) by explicitly constructing an example .",
    "in contrast , triangle tilings appear not to have any dense trajectories .",
    "_ is the behavior stable under small perturbations of the starting point and direction of the trajectory , and under small perturbations of the billiard table ? _",
    "the most surprising observation that we made relates to this question : we found that the trihexagonal tiling exhibits very unstable behavior , in that a slight perturbation of the direction wildly changes the trajectory .",
    "for example , in trying to find periodic trajectories with our computer program , we had to be extremely precise with the mouse and a tiny change would lead to a trajectory that escaped to infinity .",
    "in contrast , triangle tilings have extremely stable behavior ; changing the direction , or starting location , or angles and lengths of the tiling triangle , only superficially changes the trajectory .",
    "for example , at one point we conjectured that some behavior does not depend on the starting position , because even a vast difference in moving the mouse seemed to have no effect on the trajectory .",
    "we had trouble proving it , and found that when we `` zoomed in '' many times in our program , the starting conditions did actually have a tiny effect . in this sense ,",
    "triangle tilings are similar to outer billiards in their stability , and the trihexagonal tiling is similar to inner billiards in its instability .    _",
    "is the behavior invariant under affine transformations ? _    the dynamics of the tiling billiards system is not invariant under affine transformations , because like the inner billiards system , it uses angles .",
    "for example , all triangles are affinely equivalent , but different triangle tilings exhibit very different behavior : every right triangle tiling has an escaping trajectory ( theorem [ bisecting ] ) , but the equilateral triangle tiling has only periodic trajectories of period @xmath12 around the vertices , and no escaping trajectories ( theorem [ mf ] ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we address the question of periodic and drift - periodic trajectories in each of the three types of tilings we studied .",
    "we have results on periodic , escaping and dense trajectories .",
    "while we have observations and conjectures about the stability of trajectories on various tilings , and other basic questions about this dynamical system , exploration of the system remains almost completely open .",
    "mascarenhas and fluegel @xcite asserted that every trajectory in the equilateral triangle tiling , and in the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 triangle tiling , is periodic , and that every trajectory in the square tiling is either periodic or drift - periodic .",
    "all of these tilings , and example trajectories , are in figure [ regtilings ] .",
    "engelman and kimball @xcite proved that there is always a periodic trajectory about the intersection of three lines ( see figure [ keresults ] ) , and there is no periodic orbit about the intersection of two non - perpendicular lines . in section [ alex ] , we generalize these results to certain divisions of the plane by any finite number of lines .",
    "because neither @xcite nor @xcite is in the published literature , we include these results and their proofs here , for completeness .",
    "we also add the regular hexagon tiling , so that we have all three tilings by regular polygons ( even though the hexagon tiling is not two - colorable ) .",
    "[ mf ] every trajectory is periodic in the equilateral triangle tiling and in the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 triangle tiling triangle tiling .",
    "every trajectory in the square tiling and in the regular hexagon tiling is either periodic or drift - periodic .    [ !",
    "+        each of these tilings is reflection - symmetric across every line of the tiling .",
    "( note that there are many tilings of @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 triangles ; mascarenhas and fluegel chose the one pictured in figure [ regtilings]b . )",
    "thus , every trajectory that crosses a given line is also reflection - symmetric across that line . in the triangle tilings",
    ", a trajectory going from one edge of a triangle to another always crosses an adjacent edge , so under the reflectional symmetry it closes up into a periodic path with the valence of the vertex , which is always @xmath12 in the equilateral triangle tiling , and is @xmath17 , @xmath12 or @xmath18 in the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath16 triangle tiling tiling ( figure [ regtilings ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .    in the square tiling , a trajectory that starts on one edge either crosses the adjacent edge or the opposite edge .",
    "if it crosses the adjacent edge , it circles around the vertex between those edges , so it closes up into a periodic path with the valence of the vertex : @xmath17 .",
    "if it crosses the opposite edge , it `` zig - zags '' in a drift - periodic path of period 2 ( figure [ regtilings ] ( c ) ) .",
    "similarly , in the regular hexagon tiling , a trajectory crosses the adjacent edge , the next - to - adjacent edge , or the opposite edge .",
    "if it crosses the adjacent edge or next - to - adjacent edge , it closes up into a periodic path of period @xmath12 , and if it crosses the opposite edge , it zig - zags as in the square tiling ( figure [ regtilings ] ( d ) ) .",
    "one can also give an alternative proof of theorem [ mf ] that relates to inner billiards .",
    "in inner billiards , a common technique is to `` unfold '' the trajectory across the edges of the table , creating a new copy of the table in which the trajectory goes straight .",
    "analogously but going the opposite direction , in tiling billiards we can `` fold up '' the tiling so that congruent tiles are on top of each other , and the trajectory goes back and forth as a line segment between edges of a single tile ( figure [ folding ] ) .",
    "each of the four tilings is reflection - symmetric across every edge of the tiling , so when a trajectory crosses an edge from one tile to another , that edge is a line of symmetry for the two adjacent tiles , and we fold one tile onto the other .",
    "when we fold up a trajectory this way , it is a line segment going back and forth between two edges of the tile , so every trajectory is periodic or drift - periodic . for a periodic trajectory ,",
    "the period is the number of copies needed for the trajectory to return to the same edge in the same place , which for a vertex of valence @xmath19 is @xmath19 when @xmath19 is even and @xmath20 when @xmath19 is odd . for a drift - periodic trajectory ,",
    "the period is the number of copies needed for the trajectory to return to a corresponding edge in the same place , which in both the square and hexagon tiling is @xmath21 .",
    "[ ek ] ( a ) there is a periodic trajectory about the intersection of two lines if and only if the lines are perpendicular .",
    "( b ) there is always a periodic trajectory about the intersection of three lines .",
    "\\(a ) suppose that the two lines intersect at an angle @xmath22 , and the initial angle between the trajectory and a line is @xmath23 , measured on the same side as @xmath22",
    ". if a trajectory is periodic , then it must be @xmath24-periodic for some natural number @xmath6 , since it must cross both lines twice to return to its starting trajectory .",
    "if the initial angle is @xmath23 , the first four angles between the trajectory and the lines are @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 with the original line . by induction , we see that the @xmath27 time the trajectory returns to the original line , it will make the angle @xmath28 . for the trajectory to be periodic , we need this to be equal to the initial angle , so in a @xmath24-periodic orbit , @xmath29 , which occurs if and only if @xmath30 . the lengths are then trivially equal , so the trajectory is periodic , and must have period 4 .",
    "an example of the non - perpendicular behavior is given in figure [ keresults ] ( a ) , where the lines meet at @xmath31 .",
    "\\(b ) label the angles of intersection between the three lines @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so @xmath34 .",
    "if we start a trajectory on the line between angles @xmath22 and @xmath33 with initial angle @xmath35 ( figure [ keresults ] ( b ) ) , then when the trajectory returns to the same line , by symmetry it will have the same angle .",
    "it will also be at the same point ; the length is calculated via a simple law of sines argument .",
    "then the trajectory is periodic with period @xmath12 .    glendinning @xcite studies a system that is similar to ours : a `` chessboard '' tiling where the two colors of tiles have different positive indices of refraction , in particular where the refraction coefficient is greater than @xmath8 .",
    "this is similar to our setup , except that the angle at a boundary changes , which leads to different behavior than in our system .",
    "he finds that the number of angles with which any ray intersects the square lattice is bounded , and that if the refraction coefficient is high enough , one can use interval exchange transformations to describe the dynamics .      in this paper ,",
    "we not only extend the results presented in @xcite and @xcite , but we also provide several novel results in tiling billiards . we give a summary below of our results for line arrangement tilings , triangle tilings , and the trihexagonal tiling .",
    "we say that a _ triangle tiling _ is a tiling by congruent triangles that meet @xmath12 at a vertex with half - turn symmetry around every vertex , or equivalently a grid of parallelograms with parallel diagonals .",
    "we call a trajectory _ periodic _ if it repeats .",
    "we call a trajectory _ drift - periodic _ if there exist infinitely many distinct congruent tiles , where the trajectory crosses corresponding edges in the same place , at the same angle , and consecutive corresponding points differ by a constant vector .",
    "the first set of results concerns a division of the plane by an arrangement of a finite number of non - parallel lines .",
    "we search for periodic trajectories , and find that when the number of lines is odd , the condition is simple : * theorem [ yaythm ] : * for any arrangement of a finite number @xmath36 of non - parallel lines with @xmath37 odd , there is always a periodic trajectory .",
    "when the number of lines is even , the situation is a bit more delicate :    * theorem [ superyaythm ] : * for @xmath38 even , there is a periodic trajectory if and only if the counter - clockwise angles @xmath39 , between consecutive lines ordered by angle , satisfy @xmath40    the second set of results concerns triangle tilings by congruent triangles arranged in a particularly symmetric way , and we find some elegant results .    * theorem [ iso ] : * in an edge - to - edge tiling of the plane by congruent isosceles triangles meeting @xmath12 at a vertex formed by dividing the plane by lines , all trajectories are either periodic or drift - periodic .    the above theorem does not guarantee that an isosceles triangle tiling has an escaping trajectory ; for example , the equilateral triangle tiling ( figure [ regtilings ] ) does not .",
    "however , every right triangle tiling does :    * theorem [ bisecting ] : * every edge - to - edge tiling of the plane by congruent right triangles with parallel diagonals has an escaping trajectory .",
    "we prove this theorem by construction : if a trajectory bisects a hypotenuse , then it is unbounded .    for special right triangles",
    ", we can guarantee not only that there is an escaping orbit , but also that it is drift - periodic :    * theorem [ dper ] : * in an edge - to - edge tiling of the plane by congruent right triangles with parallel diagonals , if the smallest angle of a right triangle tiling is @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , then a drift - periodic orbit exists .    by theorem [ ek ] , every triangle tiling has a periodic trajectory of period @xmath12 that circles one vertex , and almost every triangle tiling has a periodic trajectory of period @xmath13 that circles two vertices :    * theorem [ per10 ] : * every edge - to - edge tiling of the plane by congruent triangles meeting @xmath12 at a vertex formed by dividing the plane by lines , except tilings by isosceles triangles with vertex angle greater than or equal to @xmath43 , has a periodic orbit with period @xmath13 .",
    "the third set of results concerns the complex behavior of the _ trihexagonal tiling _",
    ", which has a regular hexagon and an equilateral triangle meeting at every edge .",
    "we first prove several results about local behavior of trajectories in this tiling ( lemmas [ turner ] , [ quadrilateral ] , [ quad_triangle ] and [ pent_lemma ] ) .",
    "then we use the local results to prove the existence of several periodic trajectories in the tiling ( examples [ 6theorem ] , [ 12periodic ] and [ gooseheadtheorem ] ) , and then to find infinite families of related drift - periodic trajectories ( propositions [ drift120 ] and [ turning_drift ] ) .",
    "we show that the limiting members of such families are dense in the regions they visit :    * theorem [ dense ] : * the trihexagonal tiling exhibits trajectories that are dense in an infinite region of the plane .    we now begin our detailed study of several types of tiling billiards systems .",
    "in this paper , we consider the case of tiling billiards where the tiling is created by dividing up the plane by lines .",
    "the simplest such system is one with a finite number of lines , which we study in this section .",
    "the arranged line tiling is similar to those studied by grnbaum in @xcite .",

    "then the result is clear .",
    "the convex hull of the intersection points of the lines is called the _ central zone_. because we are considering a finite number of non - parallel lines , the number of intersection points is also finite , so the central zone is bounded ( figure [ polygon ] ) .",

    "in example [ gooseheadtheorem ] ]    define @xmath210 and @xmath243 as in figure [ goosehead_pic ] .    by the trajectory turner lemma , @xmath244 for @xmath245 .",
    "this does not change the value of the distance @xmath145 .    by the quadrilateral triangle lemma , @xmath246 for @xmath247 .",
    "this results in adding @xmath248 to the distance @xmath145 a total of @xmath12 times , for a total increase of @xmath249 .    by the pentagon lemma , @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "this results in adding @xmath252 to the distance @xmath145 a total of @xmath253 times , for a total increase of @xmath233 .",
    "thus @xmath254 . the substitution @xmath255 yields",

    "* finite line arrangements : * in this paper , we only studied divisions of the plane by finitely many non - parallel lines .",
    "one could relax these conditions , and study divisions of the plane with infinitely many lines , or include parallel lines .",
    "the unique feature of a division of the plane by lines is that there are regions of infinite area ; one could study other tilings that have this property , such as a division of the plane by the curves @xmath257 for @xmath258 , or related piecewise - linear curves .",
    "* triangle tilings : * we have many conjectures about triangle tilings based on experimental results ; these are described in section [ jenny ] .",
    "we already showed that all triangle tilings have a trajectory of period @xmath12 ( corollary [ all - triangles ] ) and that nearly all have a trajectory of period @xmath13 ( theorem [ per10 ] ) .",
    "conjecture [ fournplustwo ] says that all periodic trajectories on triangle tilings are of the form @xmath142 ; we would like to know , for a given @xmath36 , which triangle tilings have a trajectory of period @xmath142 .",
    "our results on these triangle tilings are elegant in the cases where the system is very stable .",
    "in contrast , the trihexagonal system is very unstable .",
    "we would like to understand what feature of a tiling causes this stability or instability .",
    "the triangle and trihexagonal tilings both have half - turn symmetry at each vertex , and in both cases the lines of the tiling are _ not _ lines of reflective symmetry for the tiling , so this is not the explanation . in tilings of triangles",
    "where some lines _ are _ lines of reflective symmetry for the tiling , such as isosceles triangle tilings and the tilings in figure [ regtilings ] , the behavior of trajectories is very predictable .",
    "because the congruent triangle tilings we consider are those created by adding parallel diagonals to a parallelogram tiling , a next step would be to investigate this system on the parallelogram tiling itself .",
    "another possibility is to consider edge - to - edge triangle tilings meeting @xmath12 to a vertex , where the orientation of every other row of triangles is opposite .",
    "still another direction is to consider tilings of congruent triangles that are not edge - to - edge ; the congruent triangle tilings that we consider are a two - parameter family , and allowing this offset adds an additional parameter .",
    "each of these tilings is pictured in figure [ triangle - tilings ] .",
    "this tiling exhibits a surprising level of instability .",
    "we were unable to find a single stable trajectory in the tiling ; during experimentation , even a small change in the direction or starting location of a trajectory would produce wildly different behavior .",
    "this is in marked contrast to some triangle tilings , where even a large change in direction or starting location had almost no effect on the behavior .",
    "we would like to understand why the trihexagonal tiling is so unstable .",
    "examples of periodic trajectories that we have found are in figures [ bigperiods1]-[bigperiods2 ] , and we conjecture that there are periodic trajectories of arbitrarily high period .",
    "our work also considered only polygonal tilings ; perhaps tilings or divisions of the plane by curves would yield interesting dynamics .",
    "inner billiards on curved tables , such as ellipses , yields beautiful mathematics , see @xcite , and outer billiards on piecewise - circular curves were studied during our research program , see @xcite , so tiling billiards with curves are another possible direction .",
    "additionally , since the motivation for our work is refraction of light through solids , an obvious next step would be to study this problem in three dimensions , since any real - world application to creating perfect lenses or invisibility shields would likely require solid materials .",
    "this research was conducted during the summer@icerm program in 2013 , where the first author was a teaching assistant and the second , third and fourth authors were undergraduate researchers .",
