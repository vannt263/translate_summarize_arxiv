    "magnetic traps play an important role in the study of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite . in a typical static magnetic trap , individual atomic spin couples to the spatial dependent magnetic ( b- ) field because of zeeman effect .",
    "when an atom moves in a region where the direction of the b - field changes slowly and the strength of the b - field is sufficiently strong , according to born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , the atomic spin can follow the b - field adiabatically and remain in the same trapped eigen - state of the interaction hamiltonian relative to the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the center of mass position of the atom ( or more precisely , that of the valence electron ) . in this case",
    "the atomic center of the mass experiences an effective spatially - varying potential that is equal to the zeeman energy and proportional to the strength of the b - field .    for weak b - fields , when",
    "the atomic zeeman energy is comparable to or less than the frequency of the directional variation of the b - field felt by the moving atom , adiabatic dynamics can not be followed anymore . as a result ,",
    "nonadiabatic ( majorona ) transitions @xcite for the atomic spin may occur .",
    "two potentially damaging effects can cause nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "the first happens when an atom enters a weak b - field region due to its translational motion in space .",
    "for instance , in a quadrupole trap , atoms in the weak field seeking state are accelerated towards the center of the trap where the b - field vanishes .",
    "nonadiabatic transitions always occur in the vicinity of a zero b - field . to avoid this region of vanishing b - field or a spatial `` hole , '' a number of methods",
    "have been developed to effectively plug it , e.g. , with the use of a far - off - resonant optical potential as an  optical plug \" @xcite or the more famous time averaged orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite .",
    "the second reason for nonadiabatic transitions is due to the explicit time dependence of the b - field .",
    "obviously nonadiabatic transitions may occur if the b - field changes rapidly with time .",
    "recently , the atomic quantum gas group at peking university ( pku ) reported interesting observations of multi - component @xmath2rb ( @xmath3 ) spinor condensates via switching off the b - fields of an initially spin polarized single component condensate in a quic trap @xcite .",
    "the group of prof .",
    "chandra raman at georgia tech also discovered counter - intuitive meta - stability when condensates were loaded into an  unplugged \" magnetic quadruple trap @xcite .",
    "we decided to present our theoretical studies in the hope that the theoretical framework for spinor nonadiabatic level crossing dynamics may be of interest to other groups in the field of atomic quantum gases . in this paper , we will focus on the peking university experiment in a time - dependent quic trap @xcite",
    ". the more involved situation of a condensate in a quadruple trap will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . according to the reported experiment @xcite ,",
    "the affected time - dependence for the b - field is relatively simple .",
    "after a single component condensate was created in a quic trap , the various b - field generating currents were switched off in appropriately chosen orders . whenever near - zero level - crossing occurs , multi - component spinor condensates are observed .",
    "this paper summarizes our treatment of level crossing dynamics for an atomic spin inside an external b - field .",
    "the theory is developed with respect to  the first scenario , \" where the vanishing b - field is due to the different time constants of decay for the b - fields from the quic coil and the bias coil after being shut off as discussed in sec .",
    "an alternative scenario where the b - field zero is due to different time constants of the decaying b - fields from the quadruple coil and the ioffe coil will be discussed in sec .",
    "finally we conclude and provide a brief summary in sec .",
    "the magnetic trap used in their experiment @xcite is made up from two separate coils , a quic coil and a bias coil .",
    "the quic coil consists of a quadruple trap coil and an ioffe coil in series as in the original quic trap @xcite .",
    "the compensating coils for the earth s b - field are separate and always left on ; thus will not be included explicitly in our model . before switching off ,",
    "the magnetic b - field @xmath4 created by the quic coil has the familiar configuration of a ioffe - pritchard trap and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath5 where the axial and radial quic b - field components are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ; @xmath8with the unit vector @xmath9 defined as @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the respective spatial derivatives for the b - fields .",
    "the right handed coordinate system as in figure [ fig1 ] is chosen such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the bias field @xmath15 is in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "it is created by the bias coils and approximately constant near the trap center @xcite . before switching off ,",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "if the bias field is switched off first and the two components of the quic field are simultaneously switched off after a time interval of @xmath19 , then at time @xmath20 , the quic field becomes @xmath21 and the bias field becomes @xmath22 , i.e. , both the quic field and the bias field are assumed to decrease exponentially with decay time constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the quadruple field and the ioffe field are assumed to decay with the same time constant . assuming @xmath25 as the instant for shutting off the quic field ,",
    "the total time - dependent b - field then becomes @xmath26@xmath6 is proportional to @xmath27 near the trap center or the origin ; therefore , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 . before switching off the quic field , the @xmath16 component of @xmath30 takes a positive value @xmath31 much larger than the initial value of the transverse field @xmath32 . at @xmath25 ,",
    "all atomic spins initially are polarized , thus are the eigen - state @xmath33 of @xmath34 i.e. , the @xmath16 component of the atomic hyperfine spin @xmath35 .",
    "if the quic field and the bias field are switched off simultaneously , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the direction of the total b - field @xmath30 does not change with time although the strength of @xmath30 decreases after the switching off process .",
    "nonadiabatic transitions do not occur in this case and the initial single component condensate remains a single component one .",
    "if the quic field and the bias field decrease with different time constants @xmath38 , the direction of @xmath30 changes with time and nonadiabatic level crossing arises .    in the calculations to follow",
    ", we will make a simple approximation that the atomic spatial position does not change during the switching - off process .",
    "this allows for an easy calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities between different atomic spin states at a fixed spatial position @xmath1 .",
    "this is well justified for the experiment of pku , where level crossing occurs over a time window of @xmath39 , during which an condensed atom moves a distance less than @xmath40 , provided its kinetic energy is @xmath41 .    as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath16 component of the b - field initially takes a large positive value . after the switching - off ,",
    "the bias field decreases much slower than the quic field @xcite , i.e. we have @xmath42 . at certain instant @xmath43 ,",
    "the value of @xmath44 equals @xmath45 , which causes the @xmath16 component of the total b - field to become zero . as a result of this",
    ", transitions from the state @xmath33 to other eigen - states of @xmath46 occur because of the finite transverse b - field @xmath47 in the vicinity of @xmath43 .",
    "after @xmath43 , the @xmath16 component of the b - field becomes negative because @xmath48 for a large enough @xmath20 ; the absolute value of the @xmath16 component of the b - field can become again much larger than the transverse components of @xmath30 for @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the probabilities for an atom in different eigen - states of @xmath46 can again take constant values in the long time limit .    to compute the nonadiabatic level crossing rates",
    ", we note that transitions mainly occur in the near zero b - field region , i.e. , for weak b - field .",
    "thus , we only need to consider the linear zeeman coupling of an atomic hyperfine spin .",
    "our model hamiltonian takes the simple form @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the _ land@xmath52 _",
    "@xmath53 factor and @xmath54 is the bohr magneton . for @xmath2rb atoms under consideration here ,",
    "the spinor degree of freedom refers to the @xmath3 manifold with @xmath55 . in their experiment chenshuai",

    "our problem is to find the steady population distribution @xmath59 in the long time limit .",
    "we will make use of the method of hioe @xcite to calculate the finial state probability distribution due to nonadiabatic level crossing of a high spin .",
    "because of the rotational symmetry of our model system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it can be mapped onto a spin @xmath60 spinor with the same type of coupling , described by a hamiltonian @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the familiar spin @xmath60 pauli matrix vector . the initial condition for the spin @xmath60 state is @xmath63^{t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon solving this two state problem , @xmath64 can be found easily according to the rotation group representation elements as in hioe @xcite . apart from a globe phase factor , the evolution operator corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be expressed as @xmath65 $ ] ; while the one corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ h12 ] ) is @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the unit vector @xmath67 and the angle @xmath68 are determined by @xmath69 .",

    "in fact , if @xmath109 , the bias field has already decreased to zero when the quic field is switched off .",
    "thus , during the switching - off of the quic field , the direction of the b - field does not change and nonadiabatic transitions can not occur .    in the experiment of pku , @xcite , the various trap parameters take the following values : @xmath112 ( gauss ) , @xmath113 ( gauss ) , @xmath114 ( gauss-@xmath115 ) , @xmath116 ( gauss-@xmath117 ) , @xmath118 ( @xmath119s ) , @xmath120 ( ms ) . before switching - off",
    ", the center of the quic trap is at @xmath121 . substituting the above coefficient @xmath122 of eq .",

    "( [ probability ] ) , we arrive at a simple estimate for the population distribution @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , we can estimate the population distribution with the following , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the density profile of the trapped gas cloud .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the typical dependence of such result on the time interval @xmath19 . in the calculation of figure [ fig2 ] , we set @xmath125 to be the atomic density distribution given by the thomas - fermi approximation corresponding to the initial values of the quic field and the bias field .",
    "namely , the spatial motion of the atoms is omitted .",
    "this approximation is based on the fact that the decay time @xmath126 is shorter than the period ( @xmath1274.5 - 7.5ms ) of the trap potential and seems to be a bit crude . to obtain a more accurate estimation of the atomic population ,",
    "variations of the atomic spatial distribution in the decay process of the bias field should be considered fully .    .",
    "the unit of the atomic number is @xmath128.,width=312 ]    the above result is based on the approximation that atoms do not move during the switching - off process . if atomic motion is included , more accurate population distribution can be calculated by solving the multiple - component gross - pitaevskii equation including the time - dependent b - field .",
    "a detailed comparison of these two approaches is given in ref .",
    "overall , we find the approximate landau - zener solution discussed here holds well for the parameter regimes of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the quic coil consists of a pair of quadruple coils and an ioffe coil .",
    "the b - field @xmath129 of the quic trap is the sum of the b - fields @xmath130 from the quadruple coils and @xmath131 from the ioffe coil . in the previous section",
    ", we simply assumed the b - fields generated by these two sets of coils decrease synchronously after shutting off electric currents .",
    "however , as was discovered in the experiment @xcite , the magnetic fields @xmath130 and @xmath131 do not always decay with the same time constant despite the fact that the two sets of coils forming the quic trap are in series . assuming different time constants for the decay of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the finial population distribution needs to be re - calculated .    before the quic field",
    "is switched off , the components of the b - fields @xmath130 and @xmath131 are functions of the atomic position , explicitly given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the distance between the center of the quic trap ( in the absence of gravity ) and the center of the quadruple trap .    in their experiment @xcite",
    ", @xmath134 is about @xmath135 ( gauss-@xmath117 ) and @xmath133 is @xmath136 ( cm ) .",
    "therefore , in the region near the center of the quic trap , we have @xmath137 ( gauss ) . from @xmath112 ( gauss ) , we find @xmath138 ( gauss ) .",
    "if @xmath131 and @xmath130 decrease with different time constants @xmath139 and @xmath140 after switching - off , the b - field from the quadruple coils becomes @xmath141 and the b - field created by the ioffe coil becomes @xmath142    in this section , we assume the time interval @xmath143 between the switching - off of the b - fields @xmath144 and @xmath145 is sufficiently long , i.e. , when the quic field is switched off , the bias field has already decreased to zero .",

    "a second case of some interest is when the bias field is switched off suddenly .",
    "once the bias field is turned off , the atoms begin to oscillate in the new quic trap centered at @xmath177 .",
