    "canal surfaces are envelopes of 1-parameter families of spheres , whose radii are parametrized by a radius function and whose centers form a parametric spine curve .",
    "these surfaces have been studied extensively during the last 20 years @xcite because of their applications in computer aided geometric design in general and , in particular , in operations like joining and blending @xcite .",
    "dupin cyclides form a special family of rational canal surfaces , and they have also received much attention since their introduction @xcite . in this case , the source of interest is two - fold : from a theoretical point of view , due to the fact that they are the only surfaces that are canal surfaces in more than one way @xcite and their remarkable geometric properties @xcite ; from a practical point of view , because of their applicability in joining and blending @xcite .",
    "canal surfaces can be defined by a spine curve and a radius function , and the dupin cyclides are the canal surfaces for which these entities are not unique . under the assumption that the spine curve and radius function are rational , we study in this paper the symmetries of the surface and provide a simple algorithm for finding them .",
    "moreover , our results also provide a recipe for constructing symmetric canal surfaces .    in order to conduct our study ,",
    "we make use of ideas regarding symmetries and similarities of rational curves developed by two of the authors @xcite . in particular",
    ", we relate the symmetries of the canal surface to symmetries of the spine curves , and to isometries ( if any ) between _ different _ spine curves , in the case of dupin cyclides .",
    "when applied to dupin cyclides , our results provide a classification of the symmetries of these surfaces , together with their symmetry groups .",
    "certainly , some results regarding the symmetries of dupin cyclides are already known .",
    "for instance , it is well known  and easy to see from the implicit equations of dupin cyclides in canonical form  that these surfaces are symmetric with respect to the planes containing the spine curves , and therefore with respect to the line intersecting these planes as well . nevertheless , it is not always easy to derive all the symmetries of a surface from its implicit equation . as an illustration of our characterisation of symmetric canal surfaces and dupin cyclides ,",
    "we prove that in the generic situation the aforementioned symmetries are the only symmetries exhibited by dupin cyclides .",
    "furthermore , we identify the special cases where extra symmetries appear and then determine these symmetries , thus leading to a complete classification .",
    "the computations in this paper have been implemented in a ` sage ` worksheet , which can be tried out online following a link on the website of the last author @xcite .",
    "a _ canal surface _ @xmath0 is the envelope of a 1-parameter family @xmath1 of spheres , centered at a _ spine curve _ @xmath2 and with _ radius function _ @xmath3 .",
    "the defining equations for @xmath4 are @xmath5 for fixed @xmath6 , the first equation is a sphere and the second is a plane , intersecting in the _ characteristic circle _ @xmath7 . in order to have a well - defined envelope surface , we require that @xmath8 holds for all parameters @xmath6 for which @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined . for this statement and other general results on canal surfaces that we recall in this section ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "the family @xmath11 of spheres can be identified with a curve in the @xmath12-dimensional minkowski space @xmath13 , where the point @xmath14 corresponds to a sphere @xmath15 with center @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 .",
    "the sign of the radius gives us the _ orientation _ of the sphere ( towards the centre when @xmath16 , and outwards when @xmath17 ) , which is inherited by the canal surface .",
    "thus an _ oriented _ canal surface corresponds to a curve @xmath18 in @xmath13 .",
    "the canal surface @xmath4 admits parametrizations of the form @xmath19 note that while and remain valid upon replacing @xmath3 by @xmath20 , the change in sign of the radius results in a change of orientation of the canal surface , i.e. , a reversal of the direction of the unit normal vector field described by @xmath21 .",
    "thus the sign of the second term of the parametrization in remains positive .",
    "the isoparametric curve @xmath22 parametrizes the characteristic circle @xmath23 .",
    "correspondingly , by and , @xmath24 traces a circle on the unit sphere .",
    "more precisely , for a fixed parameter @xmath6 with nonzero radius @xmath10 , equations and become @xmath25 in fact , @xmath21 describes the unit normal vector field of @xmath4 . also , for each characteristic circle , the normal lines to @xmath4 along the circle intersect at one point @xmath9 belonging to the spine curve .",
    "moreover , the derivative @xmath26 at this point is normal to the plane containing the characteristic circle .",
    "if @xmath3 is a constant , then we have a special type of canal surface , called a _ pipe _ surface . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath2 is a line , then @xmath4 is a surface of revolution .    in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are real and rational and known .",
    "additionally , we assume that @xmath2 is _ proper _ , i.e. , birational or equivalently injective except for perhaps finitely many parameter values .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rational , finding a rational parametrization of type reduces to finding a rational parametrization of @xmath27 .",
    "this was first accomplished in @xcite , and minimal degree rational parametrizations were obtained in @xcite . as a result , the surface @xmath4 is also rational , and therefore irreducible .",
    "observe that the spine curve of @xmath4 is irreducible as well , since it is rationally parametrized by @xmath2 .",
    "one can wonder if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unique for a given canal surface @xmath4 , or if there are surfaces that are canal surfaces in at least two different ways .",
    "this question was answered by maxwell @xcite , who showed that dupin cyclides are the only canal surfaces with the latter property .",
    "in fact , these surfaces are the envelope of exactly _ two _ different 1-parameter families of spheres with distinct spine curves @xmath28 and radius functions @xmath29 .",
    "dupin @xcite originally defined _ cyclides _ , now called _",
    "dupin cyclides _ , as surfaces whose lines of curvatures are circles .",
    "since then , a variety of alternative definitions has arisen @xcite , which is the underlying reason for their value in a variety of applications .",
    "maxwell @xcite also showed that these spine curves must be conics lying in perpendicular planes and passing through each other s foci , yielding three different cases corresponding to the nature of the spine curves .",
    "for each of these cases one can provide @xcite a canonical description of the spine curves , radius functions and implicit forms , shown in table [ tab : canonicalform ] .",
    "this form depends on certain parameters @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 . notice that @xmath32 in type i , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in type ii , and @xmath35 in type iii . note also that type ii degenerates to type i in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "we say that a dupin cyclide is in _ canonical form _",
    ", if it is the zeroset of @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 in table [ tab : canonicalform ] for certain parameters @xmath30 satisfying the above constraints .",
    "as dupin cyclides have rational spine curves and radius functions , eliminating the parameter @xmath6 from and yields a description as the zeroset of a polynomial .",
    "the implicit forms in table [ tab : canonicalform ] show that the dupin cyclides of types i and ii are quartics , while the dupin cyclides of type iii are cubics .",
    "furthermore , the dupin cyclides of type i are tori , and these surfaces are surfaces of revolution , since the characteristic circles are rotationally invariant about the axis traced out by @xmath40 .",
