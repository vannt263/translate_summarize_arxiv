    "these jumps in activation energy correspond to the addition of neighbor nodes to the cluster ( fig .",

    "quantized  nature of the network response leads to _ robustness _ in the local , final equilibrium patterns with respect to the input signal amplitude . to gain insight into the robustness of the localized patterns of activation",

    "there is a threshold in the energy of the input stimulus beyond which robust quantized states are form .",
    "the states are robust in the sense that further increments in the input signal amplitude do not change the final equilibrium pattern ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3]a ) .",
    "the self - organized local structures are also robust with respect to random noise in the initial stimulus .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations that probe the impact of the noise - to - signal ratio on the energy of the emerging quantized state .",
    "we have confirmed that the presence of small - amplitude noise has no effect on the equilibrium states of nodal activity .",
    "as can be expected , we do observe a departure from the energy of the base equilibrium state when the noise - to - signal ratio is sufficiently large , thereby masking the base stimulus altogether ( fig .",

    "our model predicts a range of parameter values where localized states disappear , and are replaced by _ global activation patterns_. mathematically , global patterns are possible when the non - active stationary solution is perturbed outside the parameter region of localized patterns ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "these  global  turing patterns  @xcite can be understood and modeled using the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , a method that segregates nodes according to their degree and has been successfully used to approximate a wide variety of dynamical processes in heterogeneous networks , like epidemic spreading  @xcite , activator - inhibitor models  @xcite and voter models  @xcite .",
    "this theory allow us to reduce the problem to a single equation for the membrane potential for all the nodes in the system .",
    "since in our model both the degree and two - jump degree play important role in the formation of patterns , we use a mfa where we assume that all the nodes with the same degree and two - jump degree behave in the same way .",
    "we start by writing eq .",
    "( 3 ) in the form @xmath71 where the local fields felt by each node ,  @xmath72 ,  @xmath73 and  @xmath74 are introduced . these local fields",
    "are then approximated as  @xmath75 ,  @xmath76 and  @xmath77 , where  @xmath78 is the degree and  @xmath79 is the number of secondary connections of node  @xmath17 ( two - jump degree ) .",

    "the individual model equation on each node interacts only with the global mean fields  @xmath92 and  @xmath93 and its dynamics is described by : @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since all nodes obey the same equation , we have dropped the index  @xmath17 and introduced the parameters  @xmath95 and  @xmath96 .",
    "the activation potential depends now on the global fields  @xmath92 and  @xmath93 as well as on the parameter compination ( @xmath97 )",
    ", i.e. @xmath98 . if the global mean fields  @xmath92 and  @xmath93 are given , the combination ( @xmath97 ) plays the role of a bifurcation parameter that controls the dynamics of each node in the system . the time independent version of above mean field equation can be written as a third degree algebraic equation that we solve  @xmath12 times for the  @xmath12 nodes in the system .",
    "for each node  @xmath17 , we get three solutions  @xmath99 , @xmath100 that can be stable or unstable depending on the sign ( negative or positive respectively ) of the operator  @xmath101 .    after tuning the bifurcation parameter  @xmath5 to a negative value",
    ", we can compute the global turing pattern from direct numerical simulations and determined the global mean fields  @xmath92 and  @xmath93 .",
    "each node  @xmath17 in the network is characterized by its degree and second nodal connectivity , so that it possesses a certain parameter combination , ( @xmath97 ) . substituting",
    "these computed global mean fields as well as the values of  @xmath47 and  @xmath102 into equation ( 7 ) , bifurcation diagrams of a single node can be obtained and projected onto the turing pattern . in figure",
    "( 4a ) we show for our  toy network model \" that the stable brunches of the nodal bifurcation diagrams calculated using the mfa fit very well the computed turing pattern .",
    "we further assess the dependence of the network topology on the global pattern formation and we find that when the degree distribution is narrower compared to a scale - free network , the distribution of the ( @xmath97 ) is more homogeneous and therefore the stationary turing patterns look smoother ( figure  4b and c ) .",
    "therefore , global network turing patterns are essentially explained by the bifurcation diagrams of individual nodes coupled to the global mean fields , with the coupling strength determined by their degree and two - jump connectivity .",
    "our results suggest a new mechanism for the formation of localized nodal assemblies in networks , arising from long - range  second neighbor  interactions . rather than relying on reinforcing mechanisms ",
    "synaptic plasticity , we show that localized , robust nodal assemblies are possible due to self - organization . the emergence of localized activation patterns derived from the simple and general functional structure of our proposed conceptual model : local dynamics based on activation potentials , and interactions between nodes that induce short - range anticorrelation and long - range correlation in node - to - node exchanges .",
    "the proposed system is a network analogue of the swift - hohenberg continuum model , and is able to produce a complex suite of robust , localized patterns .",
    "hence , the spontaneous formation of robust operational cell assemblies in complex networks can be explained as the result of self - organization , even in the absence of synaptic reinforcements .",
    "hence , these self - organized , local structures can provide robust functional units to understand natural and technical network - organized processes .",
