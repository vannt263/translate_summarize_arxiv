    "we investigate the typical performance of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes over a general binary - input output - symmetric ( bios ) memoryless channel .",
    "previous statistical physics based analyses of ldpc codes have discovered some interesting properties , including the fact that they can , in principle , saturate the information - theoretic upper bound ( shannon s bound defined by the channel coding theorem  @xcite ) with low connectivity values .",
    "existing statistical mechanical studies on the ldpc codes , however , have been mostly confined to the case of binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) , which fits into the statistical - mechanical framework in a natural way  @xcite .",
    "notable exceptions are the work by montanari  @xcite that discusses the case of binary - input additive - white - gaussian - noise channel ( biawgnc ) as well as the bsc case and the study of sourlas codes  @xcite , a simple ldpc code , in which non - bsc channels are addressed  @xcite . from the statistical - mechanical point of view , ldpc codes are regarded as random spin systems ; it is therefore natural to expect that they will exhibit some sort of universality , just as typical statistical - mechanical systems do , so that general properties of ldpc codes observed in the bsc case will be preserved when different communication channels are considered . in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of ldpc codes in binary - input output - symmetric channels and show that this is generally the case .",
    "in particular , we show that the finite connectivity ldpc codes can saturate shannon s bound for general bios channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : framework ] we introduce the general framework , notation , codes and the channels that we will focus on . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we will briefly describe the calculation for the various channels , while the results obtained will be described in section  [ sec : res ] , followed by the conclusions .",
    "we consider the general class of binary - input output - symmetric ( bios ) memoryless channel .",
    "the input of the channel is binary ( @xmath0 ) , and the output may take any real value .",
    "the characteristics of a channel is described by the channel transition probabilities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 .",
    "a symmetric channel is characterized as a channel whose transition probabilities satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "various types of channel models of practical interest fall into the class of bios channels , including the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) @xmath5 the binary - input additive - white - gaussian - noise channel ( biawgnc ) @xmath6 and the binary - input laplace channel ( bilc ) @xmath7 each of the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represents the degree of degradation induced by the channel noise .",
    "we call each of them the noise level and let @xmath11 denotes the generic one .",
    "an apparent technical difficulty in dealing with a general channel of real - valued output is that it is not at all obvious how to define the syndrome from the received signal : the modulo 2 arithmetic involved in computing syndrome in the bsc case is not directly applicable to the cases of real - valued received signal .",
    "this difficulty is resolved by using a truncation procedure  @xcite : we conceptually consider another _ fictitious _ binary - input binary - output channel in addition to the channel under study .",
    "let @xmath12 be the ( fictitious ) output symbol of this fictitious channel .",
    "we can assign to @xmath12 either of the values @xmath0 arbitrarily , and the binary channel noise @xmath13 for the fictitious channel is defined therefrom , via @xmath14 . for the sake of making the argument simple ,",
    "we assign @xmath15 without loss of generality",
    ". since the prior probability of @xmath13 ( _ before _ receiving @xmath16 ) should be @xmath17 , the joint distribution of @xmath16 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath18 since the truncation procedure used here yields @xmath19 .",

    "it has been known that making code construction irregular may improve performance significantly  @xcite , but we will not discuss irregular codes in the current paper .",

    "is determined by @xmath164 which allows us to decide the type of bifurcation of a particular case .",

    "( [ eq : para - stability ] ) . as a result",
    ", we found that only a few cases with small values of @xmath33 and @xmath41 fall into the second category .",
    "the values of @xmath33 and @xmath41 for which the @xmath165-mn code fall into the second category depend on the channel characteristics ; as far as we have observed , only the cases with @xmath166 fall into the second group . for the biawgnc case ,",
    "the @xmath167-mn code is the only one instance , whereas for the bilc case , both @xmath167- and @xmath168-mn codes belong to this group .",

    "we observed that the noise - overlap diagram for the cases with @xmath170 is relatively simple for the biawgnc and bilc cases , just as in the bsc case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - diag - k3 ] ) : the ferromagnetic solution with @xmath137 ( and its mirror image with @xmath171 when @xmath31 is even ) and the paramagnetic solution are the only stable solutions found , both of which are locally stable over the whole range of the noise level .",
    "the system exhibits a first - order transition at the information - theoretic limit @xmath157 .",
    "we did not find any solutions other than the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic solutions .",
    "we have analyzed typical performance of ldpc codes over bios channel using statistical mechanics .",
    "we have shown for the case of ldpc codes that the log - likelihood ratio of the received signal serves as an external random field acting on each site , and that channel characteristics define the distribution of the random field .",
    "the gallager and mn codes are analyzed , to find that the basic properties of these codes remain unchanged regardless of channel characteristics .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that these codes potentially saturate shannon s limit asymptotically , as @xmath124 , for the gallager code ; and when @xmath172    with a few exceptions with small @xmath33 and @xmath41 values  and asymptotically as @xmath154 for @xmath155 , for the mn code .",
    "saddle - point solutions have also been numerically evaluated extensively for the cases of biawgnc and bilc channels , from which noise - overlap diagrams , as well as the transition and bifurcation points , have been characterized .",

    "to probe the stability of paramagnetic solution , which exists for @xmath148 , we analyze the stability with respect to @xmath173 and @xmath174 only , and do not consider stability with respect to @xmath175 and @xmath176 ; these conjugate variables are subsidiary to their counterparts , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively , so that the former should not be considered as independent variables .",

    "we first evaluate the hessian of the free energy ( [ eq : mn - free - energy ] ) with respect to @xmath181 variables @xmath182 : @xmath183 where @xmath184 the block - diagonal structure of the hessian allows us to decompose the stability problem into two , one with respect to @xmath173 , and another with respect to @xmath174 .",
