    "by now , several discussions of the singularity issue have appeared in the context of loop quantum cosmology @xcite and loop inspired approaches @xcite to quantum cosmology .",
    "as an initial step , one often considers operators for inverse powers of the determinant of the metric such as @xmath0 as they are needed for matter hamiltonians and can be used for a first guess as to the fate of classical singularities in a quantization .",
    "in fact , many models lead to bounded operators for inverse volume @xcite despite of the classical divergence , following methods of full loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this is the case generically , for instance , in isotropic cosmology @xcite where bounded inverse volume expressions play a central role in the non - singular evolution as it follows from a difference equation for the wave function .",
    "the issue is already different , however , in anisotropic models @xcite where the same quantization gives matter densities or curvatures which are not necessarily bounded when considered on full minisuperspace . in those cases ,",
    "a non - singular evolution exists nonetheless , which demonstrates that , by itself , boundedness of kinematical operators such as inverse volume is not essential and that its role can only be seen when combined with dynamical information such as that given by the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "there are also other cautionary points one has to keep in mind when using inverse volume properties to understand the singularities .",
    "for instance , implicit in using inverse volume for statements about singularities is the classical relation between curvature divergence and inverse metric components .",
    "even if all inverse powers of the volume could be shown to be finite at the quantum level , one would still have to discuss their relation to space - time curvature , so again dynamical properties , which is more complicated .",
    "while classically , at least in isotropic cases , extrinsic curvature is proportional to an inverse power of the volume , this follows only after equations of motion are solved .",
    "thus , also at the quantum level one has to use equations of motion to relate properties of inverse volume expressions to the singularity issue .",
    "nevertheless , in order to obtain a more complete picture it is important to analyze the behavior of inverse volume in different models and also , as far as possible , in the full theory .",
    "recently @xcite , partial information from the full theory has been derived for gauge - invariant 3-vertices of spin network states which are always annihilated by the volume operator @xcite . here ,",
    "inverse volume operators have , as functions of the edge spins , unbounded kinematical expectation values in 3-valent vertex states .",
    "the new situation , unlike any example used in isotropic , anisotropic or even some inhomogeneous models so far @xcite , is that unboundedness occurs already on states which have zero volume eigenvalue .",
    "( which still is an improvement compared to the classical behavior which would predict diverging inverse volume .",
    "that this is not happening in the loop quantization is a direct consequence of the techniques introduced in @xcite . )",
    "while it would be possible to construct operators with similar properties in models , in loop quantum cosmology they would break parity invariance of the theory .",
    "( parity , i.e.  @xmath1 for the densitized triad @xmath2 , has not been studied in the full calculations done so far since only configurations of vanishing determinant are considered . )    when a difference between symmetric models and the full theory is discovered , the first reflex is often to blame it , without further corroboration , on a breakdown of the minisuperspace approximation .",
    "so also in this case , e.g.  inhomogeneities have quickly been named as a potential culprit . however , there are many technical and conceptual differences between models and the full theory , and so several reasons for discrepancies can be imagined . for a reasoned and informed judgment a deeper investigation is thus warranted . to illustrate this we mention atomic spectra as an example , where characteristic properties of the hydrogen atom obtained from a spherically symmetric potential remain intact but only become more complicated in details if realistic interactions are switched on .",
    "in particular , the atom remains stable unlike its classical counterpart .",
    "this is , of course , only true if interactions are restricted ( in this case from other theoretical investigations or observations ) and not allowed to be arbitrary . under arbitrary interactions ,",
    "properties can certainly change dramatically , and indeed do so for atoms of high central charge where the electromagnetic interaction is stronger .",
    "similarly , in quantum gravity it is not sufficient to look at arbitrary degenerate geometrical configurations unless their meaning is known .",
    "there must be an analog of switching on the _ correct _ gravitational interaction , e.g.  between inhomogeneities , which means that constraint equations or observables need to be considered .",
    "while in @xcite the main aim was to derive and point out potential differences ( also emphasizing , as oftentimes before in loop quantum cosmology , that dynamical information has to be included ) , here we analyze and contrast different geometrical configurations so as to facilitate developing a better idea for the relation between models and the full theory .",
    "we will then first review dynamical information about the singularity issue and discuss properties of inverse volume .",
    "new considerations start with sec .",
    "[ abel ] , which contains aspects of the regularization procedures of loop quantum gravity and differences to analogous procedures in an abelian truncation which play a role for geometrical operators but have not been recognized thus far .",
    "this indicates new sources of contributions to effective equations from non - abelian properties which can play a role for cosmological phenomenology .",
    "an analysis of inverse volume operators in different models and truncations to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ deg ] reveals a possible technical origin of bounded behavior which , however , is not directly related to physical information such as degrees of freedom . after comparing the behavior in models with the full theory and its abelian truncation in sec .",
    "[ comp ] , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ evol ] aspects of dynamics which in any situation ultimately has to be studied for a conclusion about singularity removal .",
    "we will find potential dynamical effects of those properties of the full theory studied in @xcite .",
    "the main problem posed by a singularity is the breakdown of dynamical equations at such a point . in any complete discussion of quantum removal of classical singularities one",
    "thus has to address three points :    1 .",
    "first , one has to isolate potential singularities , i.e.  find conditions under which singularities must occur for the classical equations .",
    "one then has to determine the quantum evolution equations for the dynamics around those classically singular states .",
    "3 .   finally , this dynamics has to be shown not to break down when quantum behavior is taken into account .",
    "all three steps , even the first purely classical one , are too complicated to approach in full generality but can be dealt with in symmetric models which classically also show a wealth of different singularities .",
    "when comparing with the full theory , one then focuses so far on the issue of boundedness of quantities related to curvature , motivated by the fact that often curvature diverges at classical singularities .",
    "more importantly , such expressions , e.g.  the inverse square root of the determinant of the metric , also enter matter hamiltonians and thus appear in parts of the dynamical equations .",
    "boundedness then is still not required but may simplify the analysis . moreover , only the second and third steps are avoided while the first one of isolating singularities is still present at full force . in this section , we will collect the currently available information about evolution and inverse volume before entering more detailed aspects of a comparison between symmetric and the full situations later on .",
    "the boundedness of inverse volume operators on superspace has proven not to be relevant for the general mechanism of singularity removal in models of loop quantum gravity as long as there is a well - defined expression at all .",
    "the isotropic case , where these developments have started , is however quite special which has led to some confusion and , occasionally , an overemphasis of certain aspects .",
    "there is only one parameter characterizing an isotropic spatial geometry and thus only one way to approach the classical singularity on minisuperspace . in this case",
    ", a well - defined behavior of inverse powers of volume would imply boundedness which indeed is realized automatically @xcite .",
    "the most crucial aspect of non - singular behavior , however , is a unique extension of evolution beyond the classical singularity which is _ not _ guaranteed even for bounded inverse volume ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this extension of evolution has been generalized to non - isotropic cases ( making use of difference equations representing the hamiltonian constraint in a triad representation ) even when inverse powers of volume or curvature components are not bounded on the respective superspaces .",
    "the key reason for using models is that for them the singularity structure is often clear and the first task above can indeed be performed .",
    "other simplifications may then arise which facilitate a direct analysis of the evolution but are not necessarily crucial for the result .",
    "for the evolution one has to specify initial values and usually also boundary values for the wave function in the _ non - singular _ part of superspace , such that one obtains a well - posed initial value problem . in non - singular situations , these data",
    "uniquely give the solution to the constraint not only on one classically connected part of superspace , but also on other parts separated by classical singularities . in this sense",
    ", one can evolve beyond the classical singularity and the singular boundary is removed .",
    "note that , although the well - posedness of initial / boundary value problems for difference equations does play an important role , this is not simply an issue of counting the number of solutions through initial values and that the existence of an extension is non - trivial .",
    "singular evolution in this setting arises when values of the wave function at the singular boundary are not determined ( due to vanishing leading coefficients in a difference equation ) but would be needed for evolving further .",
    "one can , of course , simply include those values as data to be specified , but this does not solve the singularity problem",
    ". it would even be possible classically , e.g.  in isotropic cosmology where one can specify the scale factor and matter fields at , say , @xmath3 as well as @xmath4 when the singularity is at coordinate time @xmath5 , and then solve the friedmann equation with both sets of initial values and simply glue the solutions together . in the classical as well as quantum case",
    "this would give a ( non - unique ) evolution beyond the classical singularity but would only remove a breakdown of evolution by putting in missing information by hand . for singularity removal",
    ", it is necessary to demonstrate a complete extension of wave functions given values in only one connected non - singular part of superspace .",
    "crucial ingredients are a quantum equation for the wave function on a suitable configuration space which requires an explicit construction from quantum gravity and involves analytical techniques .",
    "this equation is often called `` evolution equation '' even though it is not necessary to have a global time evolution picture .",
    "one then needs to identify classically singular parts of the configuration space and suitable transversal directions along which classical evolution breaks down .",
    "transversality means that the singularity is not simply approached asymptotically but is reached after a finite coordinate distance on configuration space .",
    "these directions would , in an evolution picture , be parameterized by internal time variables and thus a singularity will be reached after a finite amount of internal time has passed .",
    "it is then possible to ask and investigate what can happen in a more complete and non - singular theory after that time , or beyond the classical singularity .    in this step one",
    "uses classical gravity and geometry .",
    "all ingredients then have to be combined in order to see if a wave function can be extended uniquely along the transversal directions , which would correspond to evolution through the classical singularity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one can conclude non - singular behavior only if the extension is possible for any state or , if one has information on the physical inner product , any state relevant for the physical hilbert space . in this way , the explicit construction of observables and a reconstruction of the corresponding geometry is by - passed , but nonetheless models can be concluded to be _ physically _ non - singular : if an extension for the wave function to a new region is known , one can extract information from it on both sides of a classical singularity .",
    "this is in particular true for loop quantum cosmology where kinematically both sides differ only by their orientation .",
    "if extracting an effective geometry at one side is well - defined , as is required for the correct semiclassical limit , one can do so equally at the other side for any parity invariant observable .",
    "what is not strictly necessary but often useful for an explicit analysis are the existence of a triad representation , a global time variable , or bounded inverse volume on superspace ( in general , it is enough that inverse volume remains well - defined along any transversal direction relevant for the quantum evolution ; see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) . if a triad representation exists , one obtains a more intuitive picture through evolution by a difference equation",
    ".    bounded inverse volume or curvature can be helpful since any state will be in their domain of definition .",
    "the action of the matter hamiltonian can then be computed in each iteration step of a recurrence scheme .",
    "if such an operator is not bounded and only densely defined , it could happen that one needs to act on a state arising during the evolution on which the operator is not defined .",
    "this could be a reason for a breakdown of evolution related to unbounded operators .",
    "with such a property the analysis would be more complicated , but it does not immediately imply singular behavior . the dynamical behavior would have to be analyzed in a detailed manner , and all initial values leading to such a breakdown must be identified . even if one would obtain a unique extension for generic initial values ( which is likely because operators in any case have dense domains ) , it would be impossible to claim singularity freedom unless one can show that the singular states are removed from the physical hilbert space .",
    "if , on the other hand , arbitrary initial values lead to a uniquely extended state , it does not matter for the singularity issue how exactly the physical hilbert space is obtained from the space of solutions to the constraint .",
    "having discussed the dynamical aspects , we briefly recall now which operators have been studied for quantizations of @xmath0 and their main properties .",
    "all these constructions follow the general scheme of classically expressing inverse metric components through poisson brackets between connection components @xmath6 and a positive power of volume based on @xcite @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the barbero  immirzi parameter @xcite and @xmath9 the gravitational constant ) . instead of the spatial metric @xmath10 ,",
    "a densitized triad @xmath2 is used which is canonically conjugate to the connection @xcite .",
    "this relation is then quantized using holonomies of @xmath6 , the volume operator , and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator .",
    "the resulting operator is densely defined , and in some models it was found to be even bounded .",
    "a first explicit expression for a spectrum was computed in the isotropic context @xcite where , e.g. , @xmath11 on states @xmath12 with a single label @xmath13 whose geometrical meaning is given through the densitized triad component @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the planck length and @xmath17 a volume eigenvalue ) .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath18 thus determines the volume , while its sign is spatial orientation encoded geometrically in the handedness of the triad .",
    "the fact that the isotropic inverse scale factor is bounded has played a major role in further developments leading to a demonstration of singularity - free evolution in various models .    already in anisotropic but still homogeneous models",
    "the situation is different since volume can become small even if some metric components are large .",
    "the single quantum number @xmath18 is replaced in diagonal homogeneous models @xcite by three labels @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which determine the three diagonal components of a densitized triad by @xmath21 , the volume by @xmath22 and the orientation by @xmath23 .",
    "volume can then become small not only when all @xmath19 go to zero but also when , say , two of them go to zero while the third diverges at a suitable rate .",
    "this can , and generically does , lead to unbounded behavior of inverse volume eigenvalues at smaller volume unless cancellations occur .    for an inverse volume as above , or more generally a power of the volume parameterized by @xmath24 ,",
    "one arrives at an expression of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a function behaving as @xmath27 for @xmath28 but cutting off the classical divergence at small @xmath18 .",
    "this is obtained using , analogously to eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) of @xcite and its generalization to @xmath29 , the classical relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 are homogeneous connection components conjugate to the triad components @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "one quantizes the right hand side by expressing the connection components through `` holonomies , '' are not represented directly but only their exponentials @xmath34 in a manner not continuous in @xmath35 @xcite . ]",
    "e.g.  @xmath36 with su(2 ) generators @xmath37 , using the volume operator and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator .",
    "this leads to functions @xmath38    since there are still positive powers of @xmath19 in ( [ vdiag ] ) , unboundedness could be possible when , e.g. , @xmath39 becomes large .",
    "while in this case we can use the large-@xmath18 behavior of @xmath26 and see that @xmath39 does not lead to unboundedness for an inverse power ( i.e.  @xmath40 ) , other quantizations or different curvature components , where not a product as above occurs but instead a sum , lead to unbounded behavior at small volume . with the above quantization , however , inverse volume or curvature operators are always _ bounded , and in fact zero , on states of zero volume _ since @xmath41 .",
    "the latter property is not realized in the full theory where a non - zero and unbounded expectation value in 3-valent vertex states , equation ( 4.19 ) of @xcite , has recently been derived .",
    "the expression is again available for any positive value of @xmath42 if one only replaces the powers @xmath43 of that formula by @xmath44 .",
    "it can thus not only be used for inverse volume ( @xmath45 ) but also for other powers such as the volume itself ( @xmath46 ) . in all these cases the function of the three spins @xmath47 is _ unbounded on zero - volume eigenstates _ , showing clearly a difference to homogeneous models .",
    "this behavior on zero - volume states has been used in @xcite to argue that the singularity structure of full loop quantum gravity may not be captured reliably by models .",
    "what should make one suspicious , though , is the fact , unnoticed in @xcite , that not only the inverse volume ( @xmath45 ) is unbounded on zero - volume states but also the determinant of the metric ( @xmath46 ) , which can be taken as the volume of the vertex .",
    "thus , even though the volume eigenvalue is zero on any such state , there is a quantization of the volume which can be arbitrarily large . ) , which would give zero expectation values of the new operator in any zero - volume state @xcite .",
    "however , this property would equally apply to inverse powers which then also become zero and thus bounded .",
    "though maybe valuable , we will not consider this quantization choice further in this paper because it would remove the differences between models and the full theory related to boundedness of inverse volume on zero - volume states .",
    "] this should not come as a big surprise since any such state must be considered deeply quantum and quantization ambiguities can have large effects .",
    "but it also shows that the geometrical , let alone dynamical , meaning of these configurations must be understood better before the results can be used for definitive conclusions .",
    "in particular the geometrical meaning of the spin labels around a vertex should be better known , similarly to the situation in homogeneous models where the parameters can directly be associated with quantized metric components . unlike in models , a suggestive identification of those states of zero volume , or other states containing those vertices , as `` big bang states '' is premature .",
    "one particularly important aspect of a geometrical configuration used for establishing non - singular evolution in models is parity .",
    "since loop quantum gravity is based on a triad formulation of gravity , the orientation of space ( not through the background manifold but through the basic variables of the theory ) is encoded in @xmath48 .",
    "the classical formulation is not much different from a metric formulation since the two orientations are not connected by physical trajectories but instead separated by singularities .",
    "this changes in loop quantum cosmology where the quantum evolution equation connects a wave function uniquely from one parity side to the other . for this , a region of reversed parity is required since otherwise it would not be possible to extend evolution .",
    "this is the main scheme for non - singular evolution , and its main technical ingredient is the parity degree of freedom and the structure of the evolution equation @xcite .",
    "it is clear from those considerations that it is not enough to consider only zero - volume states in isolation , i.e.  static properties .",
    "the main part to a conclusion of singularity removal is a consideration of transitions where zero - volume states appear , which can only come from whatever evolution equation one is using .",
    "these are thus dynamical properties , which are crucial for any singularity statement . after providing more details about degenerate configurations",
    ", we will come back to dynamics in sec .",
    "since exact calculations in the full theory are usually quite involved , approximations other than symmetry reduction are necessary if a wider picture is to be developed . in the present context , it can be helpful to employ an abelianization by replacing the structure group su(2 ) by @xmath49 and using suitable definitions of the volume operator and other objects @xcite .",
    "many calculations then simplify , which has already been used to approach zero - volume states in a coherent state and to demonstrate that at least in this case expectation values of inverse volume can remain bounded along isotropic classical trajectories @xcite ( crucially relying on classical and _ symmetric _ properties such as how an isotropic singularity is approached ) . as we will show now , however , the boundedness issue for inverse volume operators is quite different in @xmath49 compared to su(2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath49 calculations are not only much simpler but also provide additional information which is of interest for comparison with symmetric models .",
    "in fact , many symmetric models turn out to be related to @xmath50-vertices .",
    "the labels @xmath19 of a diagonal homogeneous model , for instance , can be viewed as corresponding to a 6-valent @xmath49-vertex with edges given by straight lines entering and leaving the vertex and having charges @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "different holonomies in the model are still non - commuting and thus take su(2)-properties into account , but as far as geometrical expressions such as the volume are concerned the model can be formulated in an effectively abelianized manner , which is the main reason for simplifications .",
    "( non - abelian properties , however , enter the dynamics as given by the hamiltonian constraint . )",
    "looking at @xmath49-configurations thus provides means to distinguish between different aspects of a symmetry reduction and to see which of them are responsible for special behavior in models .",
    "however , since introducing @xmath49 also presents an approximation to the full theory , one must as well understand its range of validity and possible deviations to full su(2)-calculations .",
    "there is indeed one prominent place in our context where the non - abelian nature plays a role . in the rewriting procedure one",
    "makes use of relations of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a holonomy along an edge @xmath56 of parameter length @xmath57 and @xmath58 the volume of a region ( @xmath59 are generators of the structure group ) .",
    "the left bracket can thus be expressed by holonomies up to terms of order @xmath60 which vanish in a continuum limit .",
    "alternatively , at fixed @xmath57 the right hand side can be seen as an approximation or regularization of the left hand side .",
    "irrespective of the interpretation of @xmath57-terms , the quantization does not depend on this parameter .",
    "the poisson bracket gives then rise to a commutator in a vertex contribution to an operator , and the holonomy can be elongated or shortened at the end away from the vertex without changing the action on states .",
    "as mentioned before in homogeneous models ( see sec .  [ invvol ] ) , the application of identities such as ( [ commut ] ) is necessary because the hilbert space obtained through a background independent quantization does not allow the action of individual connection components but only of holonomies .",
    "this is a characteristic property of the quantization and is present irrespective of details of a regularization or its interpretation .",
    "it is one possible origin of correction terms in , e.g. , an effective hamiltonian compared to the classical expression just as higher curvature terms often arise in effective actions @xcite . for the arguments to follow it is important to notice that there are two different kinds of corrections on the right hand side of ( [ commut ] ) , which usually are both subsumed in the symbol @xmath61 : first",
    ", one has to approximate the connection component in a single point by a suitable edge integral and , secondly , that integral is exponentiated .",
    "if the edge length is small , both modifications imply only small changes of the indicated order .",
    "what is different in these two types of corrections is their dependence on the phase space variables .",
    "the left hand side of the equation , even though it contains connection components in the poisson bracket , depends only on triad components after the bracket is computed .",
    "similarly , if the connection component is replaced by an integral which is still linear in @xmath6 , the bracket is just evaluated in different points along the edge and still depends only on triad components .",
    "when the integral is exponentiated , however , the situation changes since in a non - abelian theory the cancellation between @xmath55 outside the bracket and @xmath62 inside is not complete : we have , schematically , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denote the holonomies running from the starting point of the edge to @xmath65 and from @xmath65 to the end point , respectively . only the contribution from @xmath66",
    "cancels in ( [ commut ] ) , but we are left with @xmath67 .",
    "again , this gives only small correction terms , but _",
    "they do depend on connection components _ , not just on the triad .",
    "in an abelianization , on the other hand , the second type of correction terms does not appear because now the cancellation between @xmath55 and @xmath62 is complete .",
    "there are still @xmath61-corrections of the first kind , but they are independent of connection components .",
    "thus , in the abelian case a commutator as vertex contribution is a more direct quantization of the classical expression on the left hand side of ( [ commut ] ) which is not the case in a non - abelian framework where regularization has stronger effects .",
    "a further consequence is that the commutators obtained in a non - abelian setting do not commute with the volume operator even though they are supposed to quantize objects which classically do not depend on connection components .",
    "again , this can be seen as resulting from correction terms as above , which do depend on the connection .",
    "indeed , in abelian quantizations such commutators commute with the volume operator , even though holonomies appear in intermediate stages .",
    "the two different correction terms also have different implications for homogeneous models .",
    "the first one , originating in replacing connection components by integrals , is clearly a consequence of a field theory .",
    "it does not arise in homogeneous models where we can simply take exponentials such as @xmath68 as used before .",
    "thus , if the first correction would be crucial for the properties of @xcite , it would clearly be an indication that homogeneous models do not reliably capture the full situation .",
    "the second type of correction term , on the other hand , is a consequence of non - abelian behavior .",
    "it disappears in an abelianization irrespective of whether it is introduced as a truncation to the full theory or effectively a consequence of a particular symmetry reduction .",
    "moreover , it even occurs in non - diagonal homogeneous models where not all derivatives with respect to connection components of , e.g. , holonomies of the form @xmath69 ( as explained in more detail in sec .",
    "[ models ] ) are proportional to the same internal direction @xmath70 .",
    "these properties , which we will discuss further in what follows , thus allow one to _ distinguish between non - abelian effects and effects of inhomogeneities_.    the above remarks on regularization are by no means saying that the quantization would be wrong or suspect .",
    "the classical limit is not affected since the relation is valid in regions of phase space where semiclassical behavior is expected . in this limit ,",
    "one obtains similar behavior of abelian and non - abelian calculations ( which in some cases can also be demonstrated explicitly @xcite ) .",
    "but when regimes close to potential singularities are studied , one should pay utmost attention to such correction terms .",
    "in fact , the rewriting procedure introduces such corrections which are expected to be strong close to singularities and can significantly influence even qualitative behavior . in addition , quantization ambiguities appear since rewriting is possible in different ways .",
    "one example for such quantization ambiguities in action is the already observed discrepancy , based on @xcite , between unbounded behavior of a full quantization of @xmath71 in a vertex even though the basic volume operator annihilates that state .",
    "since both operators correspond to the same classical expression , this different behavior is caused by a quantization ambiguity which can be traced back to the relation ( [ commut ] ) discussed above . in this case , it is clear that the volume operator should be considered more basic since it can be quantized directly using only fluxes @xcite , and as such it is indeed essentially unique @xcite .",
    "then again , the fact that it annihilates all 3-vertices is very special , resting solely on gauge invariance , and so considering only 3-vertices is potentially misleading .",
    "such properties of different operators quantizing volume show that a geometrical interpretation of vertex configurations can be complicated . unless other information is available , it is safest to use only regimes where the volume operator is close to other quantizations of @xmath72 , which in the case of 3-valent vertices means small spins . as for inverse volume operators ,",
    "they are clearly bounded on any bounded range of spins even though the volume eigenvalue vanishes .",
    "moreover , on those states , the quantized @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath71 even though this corresponds to states of small volume .",
    "there is thus a cut - off of classical divergences on degenerate vertices of the full theory .    in light of the two types of correction terms ,",
    "the difference of the two volume operators on 3-vertices must be a consequence of the second type of corrections since it does not occur , for the same valence of a vertex , in an abelian truncation ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "it is thus not a consequence of inhomogeneities .",
    "it is , rather , a consequence of additional correction terms which only appear in a non - abelian setting and can lead to more distinguishing features between otherwise similar operators .",
    "the same conclusions then apply to the behavior noticed in @xcite where commutators such as inverse volume or the alternative volume are unbounded on states which are annihilated by the basic volume .",
    "it is then crucial to understand which operator among different choices is relevant for the identification of singular states .",
    "fortunately , the presence of quantization ambiguities does not preclude definitive conclusions .",
    "in the present case , where different quantizations of volume lead to different degenerate states , one can use dynamical input as additional information .",
    "after all , the singularity issue is a dynamical problem , and isolating classical geometries or quantum states corresponding to a singularity has to be done with knowledge of the evolution equations . in a canonical quantization ,",
    "the evolution equations are given by the hamiltonian constraint operators .",
    "they do indeed contain the volume operator , but only in combination with holonomies as a commutator @xcite . where explicit evolution equations have been obtained @xcite , their coefficients are determined by matrix elements of these commutators .",
    "it is the potential vanishing of these coefficients which signals the possibility of a singularity in the quantum evolution , and knowing these coefficients is a prerequisite for understanding the removal of singularities at the quantum level .",
    "the conclusion is that , from a dynamical point of view , one should not look at states annihilated by the basic volume operator , but at states annihilated by commutators between the volume operator and holonomies as they appear in the constraints .",
    "these commutators also make use of the relation ( [ commut ] ) and are thus much closer to expressions used for inverse volume . in particular , all such commutators , whether they quantize positive or inverse powers of volume or other metric components , have generically the same kernel , smaller than that of the basic volume operator , since they differ only in containing different powers of the volume operator .",
    "issues of unboundedness on degenerate states , as in @xcite , then do not arise .      the situation is simpler in models studied so far since they have volume eigenstates which are identical to eigenstates of commutators of volume and holonomies",
    "( see also sec .",
    "[ models ] ) . to shed more light on the relation between the full non - abelian theory and those models , we study different degenerate configurations in @xmath49 and in particular inverse volume operators . since , e.g.",
    ", diagonal homogeneous models can be viewed as special cases of 6-valent @xmath50-vertices , one can directly see where potential differences come from .    in su(2 )",
    "one typically has objects such as @xmath73 $ ] where holonomies in the commutator when acting on an edge of spin @xmath74 lead to contributions with higher spin @xmath75 and lower spin @xmath76 . in a symmetric",
    "setting such as loop quantum cosmology , whose composite operators are modeled on su(2 ) expressions of the full theory , one can take the trace explicitly and obtain products of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a connection component appearing in holonomies @xmath79 @xcite . since , e.g. , @xmath80 with @xmath81 , the resulting operators are close to the behavior in the non - abelian setting because @xmath82 as a multiplication operator increases the label @xmath18 of a state @xmath83 while @xmath84 decreases it .",
    "nevertheless , since one can simply interpret @xmath81 as an abelian holonomy , one can also view this expression as obtained in an abelian setting .",
    "however , in a directly abelianized model one would rather use an expression such as @xmath85 $ ] , simply replacing the non - abelian holonomies by abelian ones @xcite .",
    "the action is then quite different because an abelian holonomy either increases the charge or decreases it , but does not give two such contributions at the same time as happens with su(2 ) .",
    "the more symmetric treatment which does model some non - abelian behavior is precisely what leads to an inverse volume vanishing on zero - volume states in isotropic loop quantum cosmology as can easily be seen from the resulting eigenvalues . in an isotropic model , the purely abelian version @xcite results in eigenvalues of the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 while the symmetric form of loop quantum cosmology gives @xmath88 as in ( [ iso ] ) . at zero volume , @xmath89 ,",
    "the first result is non - zero unlike the latter one .",
    "thus , while in loop quantum cosmology the inverse volume is automatically zero on zero - volume states , not by hand but by following constructions of the full theory , the loop inspired treatment of @xcite and also the abelianized version of @xcite can give non - zero results .",
    "@xcite also considers vertices of higher valence where even the symmetric treatment can give non - zero results on zero volume , as discussed below .",
    "however , those higher valent configurations are not contained in a homogeneous setting . )",
    "this demonstrates the importance of following full expressions as closely as possible in models , as advocated in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "while basic operators can directly be derived from the full theory @xcite , which is the crucial difference between loop quantum cosmology and an ordinary minisuperspace quantization , this is more complicated ( and so far unfinished ) for composite operators such that for them guidance from the full theory must be employed in their constructions .",
    "we can now discuss the issue of zero - volume states in the @xmath50 setting , still using our 6-vertex but now with unrestricted charges collected in a @xmath90 matrix @xmath91 .",
    "the volume of such a configuration is given by @xmath92 , such that zero - volume configurations span an 8-parameter subset of the 9-dimensional configuration space .",
    "following loop quantum cosmology , powers of metric components expressed through commutators will take eigenvalues of the form @xmath93 where only one coefficient @xmath94 changes in the volume labels .",
    "for any matrix @xmath91 , not just diagonal ones , this can easily be seen to be zero using multi - linearity of the determinant since the volume eigenvalues depend only on the absolute value of the determinant of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , a whole row of components @xmath95 vanishes in those cases and so do all volume or inverse volume operators @xmath96 constructed from them .",
    "the main difference to diagonal models is that cancellations as in ( [ vdiag ] ) do not happen ; but this is not problematic since they have not been made use of in loop quantum cosmology , anyway .",
    "the advantage of using a 6-vertex of the above form is that the geometrical meaning of its labels is clear from the identification of @xmath91 with eigenvalues of densitized triad components @xmath97 through flux operators .",
    "as we have demonstrated , boundedness can be a direct consequence of effectively abelian behavior , but it is not directly related to symmetry in the form of diagonalization or isotropy which only leads to more special matrices @xmath91 .",
    "the situation for a 6-vertex in su(2 ) of a similar type , which could still be interpreted as corresponding to a homogeneous model , is unfortunately more complicated and so far unknown .",
    "one can generalize the abelian setting by introducing more edges ( and thus more degrees of freedom , albeit still finitely many ones ) .",
    "volume eigenvalues are then given not by a single determinant but by a sum of determinants of different matrices ( for each non - planar triple of edges ) .",
    "in many cases one can reduce this to a single determinant using multi - linearity and gauge invariance , but in general this is not possible and there are explicit examples with unboundedness @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear what this means since also the geometrical interpretation of labels would be lost : we would have more independent labels than the nine values contained locally in a classical triad .",
    "moreover , such an abelian situation can not come from a geometrically motivated symmetry reduction where any vertex which is more than 6-valent ( or 6- or less - valent but without straight edges ) could not be embedded in a @xmath49-vertex . in diagonal homogeneous models .",
    "this is no longer possible if there are new independent connection components from additional edges . ]",
    "a different generalization brings us to inhomogeneities : so far we assumed edge labels to be identical for opposite edges of the 6-vertex , which can be interpreted as diagonal homogeneous models .",
    "when this condition is dropped , one leaves homogeneity but the configurations can still be interpreted as vertices of inhomogeneous models .",
    "( indeed , also in the su(2)-setting the 3-vertices of @xcite can be viewed as extreme forms of such inhomogeneous 6-vertices with three vanishing labels . ) for instance , if we have an abelian vertex with only one such inhomogeneous edge with opposite labels @xmath98 and of diagonal form , it can be viewed as a general vertex of a polarized cylindrical wave model @xcite .",
    "volume eigenvalues are then of the form @xmath99 .",
    "the behavior of inverse volume can easily be seen to be unchanged since we simply replace a label by a sum of two labels . also in non - diagonal cases ( which include the configurations used in @xcite without any symmetry assumptions ) , the previous conclusions about boundedness do not change .",
    "thus , even inhomogeneity does not lead directly to unbounded behavior .      from the preceding expressions and discussion",
    "it is clear that a direct technical reason for vanishing inverse volume operators on zero volume eigenstates lies in volume eigenvalues which depend on the edge labels only through the absolute value of a multi - linear function .",
    "examples are the multi - linear functions @xmath18 in the isotropic case or @xmath100 for a @xmath49 6-vertex .",
    "this is , however , not a necessary condition as demonstrated by the isotropic model where alternative volume eigenvalues @xmath101 , somewhat closer to su(2 ) expressions , have been used @xcite which also give zero inverse volume eigenvalues .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of multi - linear functions is quite common , as they can occur e.g.  in isotropic , diagonal homogeneous and some inhomogeneous models .",
    "it is , however , difficult to find a geometrical reason for unboundedness since many different possibilities are realized .",
    "linking unbounded behavior to , say , inhomogeneities is impossible because there are ( non - diagonal ) homogeneous models whose volume eigenvalues do not depend on edge labels through a multi - linear function @xcite , but also inhomogeneous models which do have such a dependence @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to break the multi - linearity by considering configurations with additional parameters .",
    "the simplest way is by adding more edges and their labels as discussed in the abelian setting .",
    "sometimes there are also alternative volume operators in models , e.g.  @xcite , which lead to a different dependence on labels and thus can possibly change the qualitative behavior of eigenvalues .",
    "this situation is similar to the full theory in that the volume operator does not commute with its commutator with holonomies",
    ". finally , there are models or the full theory where non - abelian effects play a role . here , new parameters are in fact provided by using general non - abelian holonomies while in symmetric models often only the killing norm of su(2 ) elements is relevant .",
    "additional correction terms are automatically switched on when non - abelian degrees of freedom are added , as we already saw in sec .",
    "[ abel ] with additional connection dependent terms in identities such as ( [ commut ] ) .",
    "additional parameters appear only if one takes into account more degrees of freedom than realized in a given symmetric model . however , the physical role of these additional degrees of freedom is not always clear since the geometrically and physically relevant ones have already been picked out by the symmetry reduction . with additional degrees of freedom , one",
    "thus has always a new physical situation which can not immediately be compared to the original , e.g.  symmetric one .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , in contrast to a minisuperspace quantization , the selection of degrees of freedom in loop quantum cosmology is not done solely by hand .",
    "common to a minisuperspace reduction is the choice of a symmetry to be imposed , which specifies the physical situation of interest and the corresponding reduced classical phase space .",
    "symmetric states , in the connection representation , are then defined as distributions in the full theory whose support contains all relevant invariant connections as a dense subset @xcite . since the support of a distribution is by definition a closed set , it is not automatic that symmetric states are not supported on some connections which do not appear as invariant ones at the classical level . at this point",
    ", crucial information from the full configuration space of generalized connections enters the basic construction of symmetric models .",
    "as the analysis reveals , the classical set of invariant connections is indeed extended to a bigger ( compactified ) space of generalized invariant connections , which can also be introduced at the minisuperspace level @xcite .",
    "however , one can prove @xcite that this space of generalized invariant connections is a closed subset of the full space of generalized connections and indeed the support of symmetric distributions .",
    "thus , reducing at the kinematical quantum level does not add new degrees of freedom , which shows that kinematically the symmetry reduction followed in loop quantum cosmology is consistent within the full theory .",
    "this justifies the treatment along the lines of a minisuperspace quantization , an issue which could never have been addressed without a detailed relation between models and the full theory .",
    "more complicated , and still open , is the question of how the dynamics of models and the full theory are related .",
    "in addition to geometrical , static properties of degenerate configurations one also needs to know their dynamical role as recalled in sec .",
    "[ general ] .",
    "this is achieved in models by using difference equations in internal time representing the hamiltonian constraint in the triad representation , which show how degenerate configurations are approached during physical evolution .",
    "the existence of such difference equations which are globally defined , i.e.  on the full mini- or midisuperspace of the model , relies on the removal of some non - abelian effects .",
    "general non - abelian behavior makes fluxes , representing triad components , non - commutative as a consequence of ( [ commut ] ) . in this case ,",
    "correction terms lead to non - commuting operators even when they correspond to metric components smeared along the same surface . ]",
    "such that not all of them can be sharp at the same time and no triad representation exists @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "local versions of the difference equation , as indeed used in inhomogeneous models @xcite , can still be possible . in models , as discussed before , one can then see that unboundedness , even if it occurs such as in anisotropic models , is no obstruction to non - singular evolution .",
    "originally , a non - symmetric ordering had been used which ( together with its associated dynamical initial conditions @xcite at least in their most straightforward incarnation ) would not work with non - zero matter densities at zero volume .",
    "such an ordering , however , is already ruled out in inhomogeneous models @xcite even in the vacuum case . with the symmetric ordering currently preferred",
    "it is not necessary for non - singular behavior that inverse volume expressions are zero or bounded on zero - volume states @xcite .      we can now ask what dynamical effects one can expect from properties of inverse volume in the full theory .",
    "so far the observed unboundedness of inverse volume on tri - valent vertices of the full theory has no direct implications for the singularity removal mechanism of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "those states can be considered zero - volume states ( even though also this depends on quantization ambiguities , see sec .",
    "[ abel ] ) but it is not clear how they occur in a physical transition . for this , one would also have to consider states of non - zero volume which in some sense are close to tri - valent vertices .",
    "this could be conceivable to do in a 4-valent setting , or on a 6-vertex using @xcite , where one would have to determine the volume spectrum on the intertwiner space .",
    "parity reversal , which is important in models , will then be controlled not by spins of outer edges but by intertwiner labels .",
    "changing from positive to negative eigenvalues of @xmath102 would not affect outer edge spins and thus not result in an intermediate 3-vertex .",
    "this could only arise after using the full hamiltonian constraint , which does change edge spins .",
    "after finding suitable such transitions , one has to see if they are required by the dynamical evolution and whether or not evolution breaks down .",
    "this could possibly be done locally by a difference equation with an intertwiner spin as clock variable even though due to the non - abelian nature no global difference equation for the constraint on superspace exists .",
    "a mechanism alternative to using dynamical information from difference equations , which would be much more complicated to obtain in the full theory , was suggested by using coherent states and following their behavior when they are peaked on geometries of ever smaller volume @xcite .",
    "one can then follow the expectation value of matter energy , which indeed in a @xmath49 calculation has been shown to remain bounded provided that fluxes are bounded along the classical evolution ( as realized , e.g. , for vacuum bianchi class a models even when approaching the classical singularity ) .",
    "this coincides with the expectation from anisotropic models .",
    "but it also shows the potential dangers of full considerations with our current limited knowledge : somewhat hidden in the calculations of @xcite is the _ assumption that fluxes remain bounded _ during the approach to the singularity .",
    "if this is not the case , there is no boundedness result from the @xmath49 calculation .",
    "relevant for boundedness is not the fact that coherent states are used in contrast to volume eigenstates in the su(2 ) calculation , but the fact that _ dynamical _ information is put in as a key additional assumption .",
    "the danger is that this assumption is based on classical dynamical properties which moreover are known only in symmetric situations .",
    "thus , although the calculations of @xcite are done in the full setting , crucial for boundedness results are properties of symmetric solutions .",
    "it would be a large step forward in our understanding of singularities if the boundedness of densitized triad components close to classical singularities could be shown more generally .",
    "this is also of importance for the mechanism of loop quantum cosmology , as emphasized in @xcite",
    ".    a similar calculation for su(2 ) would be much more involved , but to some degree one can rely on arguments that expectation values in @xmath103 coherent states are close to what one gets with su(2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , potential differences can occur particularly when unbounded behavior is to be studied . in @xmath49 ,",
    "the expectation value is independent of the connection where the coherent state is peaked since it appears only in a phase factor , but this is not the case in a non - abelian setting .",
    "moreover , as discussed above , in a non - abelian calculation there are correction terms to the basic identity which are small for small connection components .",
    "in contrast to an abelian calculation we thus expect an expectation value of inverse volume operators in a coherent state which is also connection dependent , and moreover correction terms which in general are small only for small connections entering the coherent state ( a coherent state requires a gauge choice to specify the peak position , thus making it meaningful to talk about small connections ) .",
    "accordingly , the abelian calculation should be reliable in semiclassical regimes , but not necessarily for strong curvature .",
    "while one can give arguments for the boundedness calculation of @xcite and as discussed above , this only refers to boundedness of the expectation value as a function of spin labels _ provided that all fluxes remain bounded_. these arguments can thus be used to illustrate the expected effective semiclassical behavior , but say nothing about boundedness of operators and the more complicated issue of extending evolution beyond a classical singularity . ] of expectation values of inverse volume even in su(2 )",
    "coherent states @xcite , based on the fact that holonomies are bounded functions of the connection , correction terms are important for more detailed aspects and in particular cosmological phenomenology .",
    "since classically connection components , entering non - abelian correction terms , become arbitrarily large when a singularity is approached , the @xmath49 truncation of the full theory has to be supported by additional arguments .",
    "similarly , potential correction terms to symmetric models and their dynamical role are still to be studied .",
    "a general extension of wave functions beyond classical singularities has been found to be realized in all models so far where singularities have been investigated @xcite .",
    "we now give some details in the isotropic case which also show how bringing in additional parameters of su(2 ) elements could potentially change the picture .",
    "similarly to inverse volume operators , the hamiltonian constraint @xcite is constructed from holonomies and the volume operator which in the flat case gives @xcite @xmath104)\\,.\\ ] ] holonomies are of the form @xmath105 with the isotropic connection component @xmath78 and an so(3 ) matrix @xmath106 specifying internal directions which are pure gauge . using @xmath107 with @xmath108 ,",

    "the constraint then reduces to @xmath111 ( or its symmetrization ) which has been used for the proof of non - singular behavior @xcite .",
    "here , one uses the action @xmath112 and derives a difference equation in the triad representation for a wave function @xmath113",
    ".    we can now bring in new parameters by allowing arbitrary @xmath106 except that their norm must still be one ( since otherwise @xmath78 would be redundant ) .",
    "this allows six rather than three angles in specifying the internal directions , and three of them remain after removing gauge freedom .",
    "analyzing the canonical structure of the new model and the meaning of the additional parameters ( which can be related to shape parameters following @xcite ) is beyond the scope of this paper , but we can already see potential extra terms in the constraint .",
    "the following statements can be interpreted in the context where these additional parameters are switched on perturbatively such that the basic representation of an isotropic model remains unchanged except that states now are also functions of the new angles .",
    "there are two conditions of the isotropic model which are no longer satisfied : ( i ) @xmath114 for @xmath115 and ( ii ) @xmath116=0 $ ] .",
    "dropping the first condition implies that also the second term in ( [ hols ] ) contributes to the constraint which changes the difference equation .",
    "however , there is no crucial change in structure since the equation remains of the same order ( the number of trigonometric functions in each term is the same ) .",
    "leading coefficients of the difference equation could a priori be vanishing in different places with the new term , but this does not happen since the new contribution is imaginary ( the additional sine implies an additional factor of @xmath117 in a difference operator from ( [ sin ] ) ) . the only change is thus in coefficients becoming complex .",
    "dropping the second condition is more important since it leads to a higher order of difference equations .",
    "( note that we always have @xmath118=\\lambda_k\\cdot[\\lambda_k,\\hat{v}]+ [ \\lambda_k,\\hat{v}]\\cdot\\lambda_k$ ] using the fact that the @xmath119 are normalized .",
    "but an individual commutator @xmath116 $ ] can still be non - zero .",
    ") moreover , the last two terms in ( [ comm ] ) , unlike the first two lines , do not commute with the volume operator .",
    "this is different from other homogeneous models where inverse volume operators commute with the volume operator , but it would be analogous to behavior in the full theory as noticed in sec .",
    "indeed , the extra terms in ( [ comm ] ) can also contribute to non - zero expectation values of inverse volume operators in zero - volume eigenstates .",

    "but for @xmath115 we can have @xmath125)|0\\rangle\\not=0 $ ] from the last term in ( [ comm ] ) which also corresponds to some inverse power of volume .",
    "the behavior is thus closer to that in the full theory and provides an explicit example for the role of non - abelian effects in unboundedness as discussed in general in sec .",
    "still , features of the isotropic model are recognizable . in particular",
    ", there is a difference equation which , compared to the isotropic one , is of higher order and has different coefficients . deriving implications for the singularity issue requires an interpretation of new degrees of freedom in @xmath126 in relation to classical metric components as well as an understanding of the classical singularity structure .",
    "this requires a more detailed analysis of the canonical and geometrical structure , but the above considerations already show that kinematical properties such as those discussed in @xcite can be studied in models without jumping directly to the full theory .",
    "discussing the singularity problem is made complicated by the fact that there are several different issues to be kept in mind .",
    "we have presented several technical points in this paper , so far mainly in separation from each other . before concluding we now collect these observations .",
    "information used for the singularity issue includes    * kinematical properties : eigenvalues of inverse volume or intrinsic curvature operators , or their expectation values in zero volume states or kinematical coherent states , * dynamical properties : the form of difference equations derived from the constraint , effective equations or classical dynamical properties in coherent states .    as inverse volume may or may not be bounded , its relevance can be seen only in conjunction with dynamics , e.g.  from how it appears in an evolution equation .",
    "kinematically , it does not matter which kinds of states are used to compute expectation values of inverse volume , and also in coherent states does one generally still have unboundedness .",
    "the advantage of using coherent states , however , is that it is easier to bring in dynamical information through the classical peak position .",
    "one can then show that for bounded fluxes also inverse volume is bounded , requiring an additional assumption motivated by classical properties of symmetric solutions .",
    "so also here symmetric properties are being used , even though the intention is to go beyond symmetry .",
    "( strictly speaking , the argument in @xcite does not only use available classical information because it assumes boundedness of _ all _ fluxes around a given vertex .",
    "this still has to be related to classical behavior , in particular considering the fact that more independent labels are required for an @xmath49 vertex with unbounded inverse volume than one has locally in a classical triad . )",
    "this illustrates the current state of understanding of singularities not just from the direction of quantum gravity but even classically .",
    "precise statements do not exist without assuming at least some degree of symmetry .",
    "one can try to find perturbative behavior around a symmetric solution , but in particular for the singularity issue this can be very misleading since it is not clear how perturbations would grow .",
    "( also from a technical perspective , this has been explicitly observed in @xcite . )",
    "difference equations provide alternative dynamical input where the situation can be decided fully at the quantum level .",
    "classical information is then required only to identify classical singularities .",
    "so far , however , this procedure is restricted to symmetric situations .      as already mentioned in the beginning",
    ", isotropy is very special with minisuperspace having the same dimension as trajectories .",
    "there is then only one way to approach a classical singularity , and inverse volume expressions are completely bounded .",
    "anisotropic models are more general and display almost all of the explicitly known characteristic behavior of classical singularities . here",
    ", curvature is in general unbounded on minisuperspace .",
    "there are some inhomogeneous models which are not necessarily more complicated as far as unboundedness is concerned , but dynamical properties are more difficult to disentangle . in other models or in the full theory ,",
    "even the boundedness issue can be problematic as a consequence of non - abelian behavior .",
    "the latter may be a potential source for differences between models and the full theory , but its relevance requires a better understanding of non - abelian degrees of freedom .",
    "this is of importance for the role of additional ambiguities and for finding the relation between degenerate and singular states . from this point",
    "we come to the final issue :      non - abelian properties clearly have to be taken into account in the full theory , but also in several models such as non - diagonal homogeneous models @xcite or unpolarized cylindrical waves @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities certainly appear in the full theory but also in models such as spherical symmetry or cylindrical waves . here",
    ", one should remember that the role of all the degrees of freedom provided by loop quantum gravity or inhomogeneous models is not yet clear ; in particular , the relation between mathematical degrees of freedom and physical inhomogeneities , i.e.  fields on a given homogeneous background , is not fully understood .",
    "this is relevant especially when vertices of arbitrarily high valence are considered in the full theory which provides a potentially infinite number of degrees of freedom but of undetermined geometrical role .",
    "this issue is the most difficult to analyze because in general there is no clear separation between non - abelian effects , inhomogeneities and the valence of vertices .",
    "high - valent vertices can occur only in the full setting or in models whose symmetry orbits have at most dimension one . however , there are abelian as well as non - abelian homogeneous models , and also both kinds of inhomogeneous models .    to avoid having to deal with arbitrarily high valent vertices",
    "we can restrict ourselves to three - valent ones , or six - valent if there are three straight edges entering and leaving a vertex , since this is anyway the only calculation available from the full point of view so far .",
    "it also represents the combinatorial situation of models where singularities have been studied so far .",
    "then , a distinction between non - abelian effects and inhomogeneities becomes possible as discussed in sec .",
    "[ abel ] : while the non - abelian volume operator does not commute with inverse volume , the latter then having unbounded expectation values in states annihilated by the former , volume and inverse volume do commute in the abelian case and inverse volume vanishes on zero volume states . here , inhomogeneity does not play any role whatsoever and thus can not be responsible for unboundedness . in an abelian calculation , one obtains unboundedness only at vertices of high valence for which the geometrical role of their labels is unknown .",
    "we emphasize again that inverse volume is considered here only because it is the best understood operator in this context .",
    "otherwise , unboundedness properties of curvature already arise when introducing anisotropy , not even inhomogeneities .",
    "we have demonstrated that , from currently available information , there is no contradiction between models and the full theory of loop quantum gravity . instead",
    ", a consistent picture emerges when all cases , isotropic as well as anisotropic or inhomogeneous models and the full theory , are considered .",
    "there is a technical difference between inverse volume in the full theory and similar operators in models , in that the expectation values in the full theory are unbounded on states of vanishing volume eigenvalue , while they are zero on such states in models considered so far .",
    "however , in the full theory the distinction of singular states , in particular their identification with certain degenerate states , is blurred due to non - abelian effects .",
    "there is then no crucial difference between a model where curvature is unbounded _ close to singular states _",
    "( i.e.  for quantum labels close to those of a singular state ) and the full theory where inverse volume is unbounded _ on degenerate states _ which can be argued to be close to , but not necessarily identical with singular states . any claim of a contradiction between models and the full theory , based on these properties , is thus unsubstantiated",
    ".    nevertheless , there are certainly differences by design since models capture behavior only in a particular , geometrically selected sector of physical interest .",
    "what is clear from the considerations is that so far inhomogeneities can not be made responsible for any explicit discrepancy between models and the full theory . to judge what implications particular properties of inverse volume operators have ,",
    "their geometrical and dynamical roles must be clear before rushing to conclusions .",
    "the latter can be derived , e.g. , through difference equations representing the hamiltonian constraint or observables . but also from the classical side one needs to provide knowledge on the general singularity structure , which becomes exceedingly complicated when symmetry assumptions are dropped ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main issue to be checked in further investigations is implications of non - abelian effects not studied so far in the different sectors of loop quantum gravity ( including not only cosmological situations but also black hole horizons and other models or semiclassical states , all of which often exploit possible eliminations of non - abelian terms in explicit calculations ) . in models ,",
    "understanding the meaning of degenerate configurations is achieved by the selection of an appropriate sector of the theory displaying the configurations of interest explicitly .",
    "we emphasize again that at this point crucial information from the full theory enters through distributional states .",
    "the symmetry is specified for the physical context , and then the relevant quantum degrees of freedom result through derivation .",
    "( similarly , imposing black hole horizons selects the appropriate degrees of freedom , again in an effectively abelian manner , through physical conditions for an isolated horizon @xcite relating horizon degrees of freedom to full flux operators . )",
    "this suggests that non - abelian degrees of freedom are not always crucial physically , which can also be seen from the fact that diagonal homogeneous models , which in contrast to non - diagonal ones can effectively be abelianized , show the complete behavior of cosmological evolution @xcite .",
