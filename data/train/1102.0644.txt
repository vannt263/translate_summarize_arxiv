    "coherence phenomenon of the pion decay process becomes important when the pion is a wave of the long coherence length .",
    "the decay process then is studied using a time - dependent schrdinger equation , and the neutrino in the final state becomes a wave that maintains the coherence for a long interval .",
    "furthermore if this neutrino wave is a superposition of waves of particular complex phases , this shows an interference phenomenon .",
    "the total number of the neutrino events is large in the recent ground experiments , and the interference of the neutrino may become observable there . to study the interference phenomenon of the neutrino in the decay of high - energy pion @xmath0 especially the physics derived from the time - dependent wave function and sensitive to absolute value of the neutrino mass , is the subject of the present paper .",
    "understanding the neutrino is in rapid progress .",
    "neutrinos are very light and the mass squared differences were given from recent flavour oscillation experiments  @xcite using neutrinos from the sun , accelerators , reactors , and atmosphere as , @xcite @xmath1,\\nonumber\\\\    where @xmath2 are mass values .",
    "the absolute values of masses are important but are not found from the oscillation experiments .",
    "tritium beta decays @xcite  have been used for determining the absolute value but the existing upper bound for the effective electron neutrino squared - mass is of order @xmath3 $ ] and the mass is @xmath4 $ ] from cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino is also idealistic for the test of quantum mechanics due to its weak interaction with matters , although the validity of quantum mechanics is certain from many tests and applications made in the past . for these implications ,",
    "much works should be done further .    to study the coherence phenomenon of the neutrino , coherence properties of the pion should be known .",
    "one particle states which have finite coherence lengths are described by wave packets @xcite . by using wave packets , position - dependent amplitudes and probabilities",
    "are also computed .",
    "coherence properties of the neutrino produced in pion decay are determined by the pion s coherence properties and decay dynamics . when the pion s coherence length is short",
    ", the pion and the neutrino behave like particles .",
    "the total decay rate and average life time are computed in the usual way and the neutrino shows no physical phenomenon which has an origin in the spatial coherence .",
    "in other situation when the pion has a long coherence length , the pion and the neutrino behave like waves and the interference phenomenon of neutrino appears in the space - dependent wave function and probability , which will be presented here .",
    "we focus on quantitative analysis of the neutrino produced in pion decay .",
    "if these particles are described by plane waves , the transition amplitude has the delta function of the energy and momentum conservation and the total transition probability is proportional to time interval t. the decay rate and the mean life time are found from the proportional constant . here we study finite - size corrections in the pion decay process .",
    "namely the various probabilities of the pion decay process are computed in the situation where the distance between the initial and finial states is finite and the time interval between them is also finite . from the integral representation of the probability ,",
    "as is explicitly given in section 4 , a large finite - size correction is lead if the correlation function of the pion and muon system has a light - cone singularity .",
    "the dependence of the probabilities on these values are also determined by the light - cone singularity .",
    "the time - dependent wave function of the whole process gives rise to this correction , which , furthermore , becomes observable quantity by the use of wave packet expression of the particle states , instead of the plane waves .",
    "a neutrino produced in pion decay propagates finite distance before it is detected .",
    "the distance is not fixed but varies within the size of the pion decay region .",
    "so the neutrino wave at the detector is a superposition of those that are produced at different positions .",
    "if these positions are in one pion , as in fig.@xmath5 the interference phenomenon of the neutrino wave is possible .",
    "let the pion s coherence length , @xmath6 , and velocity , @xmath7 , and find the criteria when this happens .",
    "when the neutrino is produced either at time @xmath8 or @xmath9 from the pion that is prepared at @xmath10 and is detected at @xmath11 , after traveling with the light velocity , they satisfy @xmath12 if these particles travel in one - dimensional space , where the light velocity is used for the neutrino velocity @xmath13 .",
    "so this is one of the conditions for the neutrino interference in the one - dimensional space .",
    "if this criteria holds , the neutrino wave from @xmath8 can interfere with the neutrino wave from @xmath9 . at high energy ,",
    "the pion velocity is close to the light velocity and the left hand side of eq.@xmath14 becomes to @xmath15 , hence this condition is satisfied at the time difference @xmath16 . when this length @xmath17 is macroscopic size , the coherence phenomenon of the neutrino at the macroscopic length is possible .",
    "we will estimate the coherence lengths of these particles in second section and will see that this condition in three - dimensional space is satisfied in the macroscopic distance . in this situation the amplitude for detecting neutrino at a finite distance is given by the integral of the product of wave functions of the pion , muon , and neutrino over the coordinate .",
    "now we recall that the velocity of any relativistic waves approaches the light velocity , when the momentum becomes infinite .",
    "hence the space - time positions of weak interaction @xmath18 where the neutrino is produced in a system of the incoming pion wave and outgoing muon wave have the light velocity at the large momentum and the two point correlation function defined from the pion and muon states in the decay probability @xmath19 has a light - cone singularity . since the light - cone singularity is real and extended in wide area of space and time which almost overlaps with the neutrino s space - time path , the neutrino probability , which is the integral of the neutrino wave function multiplied by the light - cone singularity , gets the direct effect from the phase of the neutrino wave function .",
    "the phase of the neutrino wave of mass @xmath20 and energy @xmath21 is expressed by using the differences of two positions @xmath22 and of two times @xmath23 , as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "this phase is expressed in the form @xmath27 , if @xmath28 is substituted . here",
    "@xmath29 is the unit vector along the neutrino momentum .",
    "since the angular velocity @xmath30 is extremely small , this gives a large and long - distance correction .",
    "thus the light - cone singularity of the pion and muon system and the light velocity and slow phase of the neutrino wave function are combined to produce the finite - distance correction to the neutrino probability . because the neutrino s mass is extremely small ,",
    "the correction is expected to be of the large distance .     and produced at @xmath8 or @xmath9 in the inside of the traveling pion wave . ]",
    "we investigate the physical phenomena that have a deep connection with the neutrino s coherence and interferences in the high - energy pion decay . for simplicity",
    "we study the parameter region where the absolute value of the neutrino mass is much larger than the mass differences and the effect of the flavour oscillation is negligible .",
    "more general situations will be studied later .",
    "other interference phenomena caused by solar neutrinos , reactor neutrinos , and others are studied in a next work .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2 ,",
    "the sizes and shapes of wave packets are studied . in section 3 ,",
    "we study neutrino production amplitude in the pion decay and in section 4 , we study neutrinos detection probability .",
    "the probability is expressed as the sum of normal term and new term .",
    "the position - dependent probability is obtained from the light - cone singularity of the decay correlation function in section 5 .",
    "summary and prospects are given in section 6 .",
    "in the decay of the pion eq.@xmath31 , the pion is in the beam and the neutrino is detected by the detector .",
    "pions are produced in collisions of protons with nucleus and are superpositions of plane waves .",
    "weak decay of a pion is studied normally using momentum eigenstates of the pion , neutrino , and muon . in the present paper ,",
    "position dependent probability for the neutrino is studied and the neutrino is expressed by a wave packet , which is extended around its centers in position and momentum . in order to clarify this probability , initial pion is also expressed by a wave packet .",
    "the wave packet size is determined by the detection process for the neutrino but by the production process and medium effect for the pion .",
    "a particle in matter is described by a wave that maintains coherence in a finite region defined by the mean free path @xcite .",
    "when the particle of the finite mean free path is emitted into vacuum , the wave representing this particle propagates .",
    "this wave is expressed by a wave packet .",
    "hence a quantum mechanical transition of this particle state is computed from the overlap integral of the wave functions .",
    "the wave function of the finite spatial size has also a finite momentum width .",
    "we estimate the wave packet size of a proton first and those of a pion and neutrino next , following the method of our previous works @xcite .",
    "since pions are produced in collisions of protons with nucleus , the coherence lengths of pions are determined by those of a proton and nucleus .",
    "a proton in matter interacts with nucleus and has a finite mean free path or a finite coherence length .",
    "the target nucleus has a microscopic size of order @xmath32[m ] and its position is extended in a size of nucleus wave function in matter .",

    "it is important to study the neutrino wave packet for our purpose of studying the interference .",
    "a particle of the finite coherence length is described by a wave packet , which is extended in the momentum and position around the centers @xmath84 .",
    "although its precise shape is unknown generally in real experiments , the physical quantity should have universal value that is independent from the details of wave packet .",
    "we shall obtain the physical quantity that has universal properties .",
    "the quantity that depends on the wave packet shape is neither genuine nor universal and is not important .",
    "we give a summary of the wave packets in the following , since the wave packet may be unfamiliar to some readers .",
    "first , the wave packets are localized in the momentum and position around their centers @xcite",
    ". the whole set of the wave packets becomes complete set @xcite , @xmath85 independent from the shape parameter @xmath86 which is discussed later .",
    "second , the wave packet preserves the discrete symmetries such as invariances under space and time inversions , which have not been studied before but are quite natural , since the origin of the wave packet is the interactions of the particle with matters in detectors and the wave packet sizes are estimated in the next section under this consideration .",
    "this interaction has an origin in quantum electrodynamics that preserves parity and time reversal symmetries .",
    "so the wave packets should preserve parity and time reversal invariances .",
    "we study , hence , the wave packets which are superpositions of the plane waves around the central momentum with a weight function that has the same property under these transformations , @xmath87 where the momentum @xmath88 is the central value of the momentum . in the present work , @xmath89 is used for the integration variable and @xmath88 is used for the central value of momentum .    since the time reversal invariance is satisfied in the quantum electrodynamics and weak interactions in the lowest order , the wave packet which is invariant under the time inversion is most important . under the time inversion ,",
    "the coordinate and momentum variables are transformed into @xmath90 and the plane wave is transformed to its complex conjugate , @xmath91 so when the weight satisfies @xmath92 the state described by the wave packet is the superposition of the waves which are transformed equivalently under the time inversion , @xmath93    next we study the space inversion . although neutrino violates this symmetry , the wave packet may preserve . under the space inversion , the coordinate and momentum variables",
    "are changed into @xmath94 and the plane wave is changed into @xmath95 so when the weight satisfies @xmath96 the state described by the wave packet is transformed in the following way , @xmath97 in the same way as the plane wave .",
    "the invariance under the time reversal , eq.@xmath98 , is a strong condition and leads the important result .",
    "we study wave packets that satisfy eq.@xmath98 .",
    "the simplest form of satisfying this property is the gaussian wave packet @xmath99 @xmath100 where the parameter @xmath101 shows the size of the wave packet in the coordinate space and @xmath102 is the normalization factor .",
    "we write a wave packet of a parameter @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",
    "the gaussian wave packet is the state at @xmath105 and non - gaussian wave packets are the states at @xmath106 . the calculations using the gaussian wave packet are presented in most places hereafter for the sake of simplicity , except the derivation of the large distance behavior of the neutrino wave function .",
    "it has the universal form regardless of the details of the wave packets , as far as the invariance under the time inversion holds .",
    "the theorem for the general wave packets that are invariant under the time inversion eq.@xmath98 holds and is given in section 4 .",
    "it is worthwhile to verify the results using explicit calculations of the gaussian wave packet or various non - gaussian wave packets , which are made partly in the text and in the appendix .",
    "the normal physical quantity of microscopic physics is obtained from ordinary scattering which has no dependence upon the distance or time interval between the initial and final states .",
    "this is because the length of the microscopic system is so small that the size of experimental apparatus is regarded infinite and the boundary conditions of ordinary scatterings which are defined at @xmath107 of plane waves are suitable .",
    "hence the amplitude and probability are defined using plane waves and the boundary conditions at @xmath107 ensure the independence of the probability from the distance and particle s coherence length .    for the neutrino",
    "the situation is different because the neutrino mass is so small that a new energy scale defined by @xmath108 becomes extremely small and a spatial length which is inversely proportional to this energy becomes macroscopic length .",
    "it is important to find a physical quantity that depends on this length , since it may give a new important information . to find a scattering amplitude and probability that have a dependence on the length or time interval",
    ", we use the amplitude defined from wave packets of finite spatial sizes , @xmath101 .",
    "those wave packets that have central positions and are localized well around the central positions and that have the same properties in the momentum variable are suitable for this purpose .",
    "the simplest wave packets of having these properties are gaussian wave packets eq.@xmath109 which satisfy the minimum uncertainty relation between the variances of the position and momentum .",
    "non - gaussian wave packet parameterized by a parameter @xmath86 and has larger uncertainties is easily defined by multiplying hermitian polynomials to the gaussian function .    from eq.@xmath110 ,",
    "the total transition probability is independent from the parameter @xmath103 @xmath111 which also agree to that of the plane waves .",
    "the probability of the finite distance is defined by restricting the center positions @xmath112 in the inside of a finite spatial region @xmath113 .",
    "the completeness condition for the function in this region @xmath113 is then @xmath114 and the probability satisfies @xmath115 and is also independent from the @xmath103 .",
    "we study the probability that is the average over a finite neutrino energy region @xmath116 @xmath117 and extract the physical quantity .",
    "for the genuine physical quantity , the value should be determined uniquely .",
    "the energy uncertainty of the neutrino experiment is of the order 10 percent of the total neutrino energy .",
    "this magnitude is the same order as that of the minimum uncertainty if the neutrino energy is @xmath33 [ gev ] .",
    "so the minimum wave packet is applied directly in this case .",
    "the probability for a larger energy uncertainty is computed using the probability of the small energy uncertainty .",
    "the dependence of the neutrino probability on the distance will be shown to have the universal behavior .",
    "using the wave packet representation obtained in the previous section , we find the position - dependent neutrino amplitude .",
    "semileptonic decay of a pion is described by the weak hamiltonian @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are the pion field , muon field , and neutrino field @xcite . in the above equations , @xmath122 is the coupling strength , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are the leptonic charged vector current , and leptonic pseudoscalar . the coupling is expressed with fermi coupling @xmath125 and pion decay constant @xmath126 , @xmath127      when the number of the neutrino events is large enough , the distributions of the neutrino events are computed with the quantum mechanical wave functions . for the electron bi - prism experiments of tonomura et al @xcite ,",
    "the electrons interferences of the sharp energy become visible when the total number becomes significant .",
    "even though the initial electrons have no correlation and each event occurs randomly , when number of the electrons becomes large , the signal exceeds the statistical fluctuation and the distribution shows the interference behavior . a large number of events is also necessary for the quantum mechanical interferences become visible for the neutrinos from the pion decays .",
    "in this situation each pion decay occurs randomly and its distribution is computed using quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "we study this situation hereafter and compute the amplitude and probability quantum mechanically .    a wave function which describes a pion and its decay products satisfies a schrdinger equation @xmath128 where @xmath129 stands for the free hamiltonian and @xmath130 stands for the interaction hamiltonian eq.([weak - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the solution is @xmath131 in the first order of @xmath130 .",
    "a muon and a neutrino are described by one wave function of eq.@xmath132 , @xmath133 , and all the informations of this system are computed from this wave function .",
    "physical quantities were studied with this wave function @xcite and the finite time interval effect was found .    here",
    "the matrix elements between @xmath133 and the state @xmath134 defined next is studied instead of the wave function itself .",
    "since all the informations of the wave function @xmath133 are included in this matrix element , as far as a complete set of @xmath134 is used , this matrix element is equivalent to the wave function",
    ". furthermore the position - dependent informations on the decay process are found by the use of the wave packets .",
    "the coherent phenomenon of the neutrino which depends on the position and the neutrino detection probability are studied here with this matrix element .",
    "the transition amplitude from a pion located around the position @xmath135 to a neutrino at the position @xmath136 and the muon is studied hereafter . because the muon is not observed and all the states are summed over , the most convenient wave is used for the muon .",
    "this amplitude is @xmath137 where the states are described by the wave packets of central values of momenta and coordinates and the widths in the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 in this paper the spinor s normalization is @xmath140 in the above equation the pion s life time is ignored .",
    "the sizes , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , in eqs.@xmath143 and @xmath144 are sizes of the pion wave packet and of the neutrino wave packet .",
    "minimum wave packets are used in most of the present paper but non - minimum wave packets are studied and it is shown that our results are the same . are multiplied to the right - hand side of eq.@xmath144 .",
    "the completeness of the wave packet states is also satisfied for the non - minimum case and the total probability and the probability of the finite distance and time are the same .",
    "we will confirm in the text and appendix that the universal long - range correlation of the present work is independent from the wave packet shape as far as the wave packet is invariant under the time inversions . ]    from the results of the previous section , the size of pion wave packet is of the order @xmath145[m ] and the momentum has a small width .",
    "so the pion momentum is integrated easily , and is replaced with its central value @xmath146 and the final expression of eq.@xmath143 is obtained . for the neutrino , the size of wave packet should be the size of minimum physical system that a neutrino interacts , i.e. , the nucleus . hence to study neutrino interferences",

    "the amplitude @xmath147 for one pion to decay into a neutrino and a muon is written in the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 this amplitude depends upon the coordinates @xmath150 explicitly and is not invariant under the translation .",
    "we integrate the neutrino momentum of eq.@xmath151 by applying gaussian integral and find the coordinate representation of the neutrino wave function .",
    "it is found that a phase of neutrino wave function has a particular form that is proportional to the square of the mass and inversely proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "for not so large @xmath152 region , @xmath153 is integrated around the central momentum @xmath154 in eq.@xmath151 .",
    "the amplitude becomes , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the normalization factor , @xmath157 is the neutrino velocity , and @xmath25 is the phase of neutrino wave function .",

    "the phase becomes proportional to the neutrino mass squared and inversely proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "the magnitude of the phase at the position eq.@xmath163 is small due to the cancellation between the oscillation in time and space .",
    "this cancellation does not occur in the derivatives of the phase with respect to the coordinate , which are given in the form @xmath164 this is not proportional to the square of neutrino mass but is determined by the energy and momentum .",

    "the slowly decreasing component decreases with the scale determined by the neutrino s mass and the energy .",

    "so in order to observe the slow decreasing behavior for the small neutrino mass less than or about the same as @xmath458 $ ] , the electron neutrino should be used .",
    "the decay of the muon and others will be studied in a forthcoming paper . in fig.@xmath462 the energy dependence of the total probability",
    "the long - range term has a different form and has a maximum at the neutrino energy @xmath463 .",
    "when the momentum distribution @xmath207 of the initial pion is known , the energy - dependent probability of the neutrino is given by eq.@xmath442 .",
    "eq.@xmath442 is also independent from the position @xmath420 and depends upon the momentum of the pion and of the neutrino and the time difference @xmath421 . in the experiments ,",
    "the pion s position is not measured and the average over the position is made .",
    "this average probability agrees to eq.@xmath442 .",
    "the probability varies slowly with the pion s momentum and is regarded constant in the energy range of order @xmath172[mev ] .",
    "so the experimental observation of the diffraction term is quite easy .",
    "the long - distance correction of the neutrino detection probability was obtained using the wave packets .",
    "the correction is decreasing extremely slowly with the distance .",
    "the slope is determined only from the mass and energy of the neutrino and is independent from details of other parameters of the system such as the size or shape of the wave packets and the position of the final wave packets and others .",
    "hence this is the genuine property of the wave function @xmath464 , of eq.@xmath132 .",
    "the slope of this term has the universal property and is capable of measuring in experiments .",
    "when the muon is observed in the same processes , the anomalous behavior is determined by the mass and energy of the muon as @xmath465 .",
    "since the muon mass is larger than the neutrino mass by @xmath466 , the typical length for the muon is smaller than that of the neutrino by @xmath467 . for the muon of energy 1@xmath468 $ ] , the length is order @xmath469[m ] . this value is a microscopic size .",
    "so the muon probability becomes constant in this distance and has no observable long - range effect .",
    "the muon from the pion decay has no coherence effect and can be treated incoherently .",
    "in this paper , we studied the interference of the neutrino in high energy pion decay . the position - dependent neutrino flux was computed and the new long - distance component of universal property that is insensitive to the pion s initial conditions was found to exist in addition to the normal in - coherent term .",
    "the pion s coherence length estimated in section 2 shows that this is long enough for the new universal term to be observed . since the new term reflects the interference of the neutrino , it decreases with the distance in the universal manner that depends upon the absolute value of the neutrino mass .",
    "the present interference phenomenon is caused by the light - cone singularity of the correlation function of the pion and muon system @xmath470 and the slow phase @xmath471 of the neutrino wave function , eq.@xmath174 these two ingredients are characteristic phenomena of the relativistic invariant system .",
    "the light - cone singularity is formed from the waves of the infinite momentum , which have always the light velocity .",
    "the slow phase of the neutrino wave packet is the outcome of the cancellation between the time and space oscillations .",
    "the phase is determined by the difference of space - time coordinates @xmath472 and the central values of the energy and momentum , as @xmath473 , where the energy @xmath474 is given by @xmath475 .",
    "when the difference of positions @xmath476 is moving with the light velocity in the parallel direction to the momentum @xmath477 , @xmath478 , as @xmath479 , then the total phase becomes @xmath480 .",
    "the angular velocity becomes the small value @xmath481 due to the relativistic invariance and makes the interference phenomenon long - range .",
    "the new term in the probability decreases slowly with the distance in the universal manner determined by the mass and energy of the neutrino as @xmath482 .",
    "this form is independent from the details of wave packet shape and parameters as far as the reality of the neutrino wave function @xmath483 is satisfied , which is ensured from the invariance under the time inversion .",
    "the relative magnitude of this component is not universal and depends upon the size of wave packet .",
    "based on the estimation of the size , we found that the magnitude of the new universal term is sizable for the measurement . since the slope of the probability , eq.@xmath401 ,",
    "is determined by the mass and energy of the neutrino , the absolute value of the neutrino mass would be found from the neutrino interference experiments .",
    "the new component shall be observed as the excesses of the neutrino flux in the ground experiments .",
    "the excesses of the neutrino flux at the macroscopic short distance region of the order of a few hundred meters were computed and shown in figs .",
    "( 3)-(8 ) . from these figures , the excesses are not large but are sizable magnitudes .",
    "hence these excesses shall be observed in these distances .",
    "actually fluxes measured in the near detectors of the long - baseline experiments of k2k @xcite and miniboone @xcite may show excesses of about @xmath457 percent of the monte carlo estimations .",
    "monte carlo estimations of the fluxes are obtained using naive decay probabilities and do not have the coherence effects we presented in the present work .",
    "so the excess of these experiments may be related with the excesses due to interferences .",
    "the excess is not clear in minos @xcite . with more statistics , qualitative analysis might become possible to test the new universal term on the neutrino flux at the finite distance . from figs .",
    "( 3)-(8 ) , if the mass is in the range from @xmath458 $ ] to @xmath484 $ ] , the near detectors at t2k , miniboone , minos and other experiments might be able to measure these signatures .",
    "the absolute value of the mass could be found then .",
    "it is worthwhile at the end to summarize the reasons why the interference term of the long - distance behavior emerges in the pion decay and is computed with the wave packet representation .",
    "the connection of the long - distance interference phenomenon of the neutrino with the heisenberg s uncertainty relation is also addressed here .    due to relativistic invariance ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath485 has a singularity near @xmath226 , which is extended to large distance @xmath486 , as was shown in eq.([singular - function - f ] ) .",
    "this is one of the features of relativistic quantum fields and is one reason why the long - range correlation emerged . for a non - relativistic system ,",
    "on the other hand , the same calculation for stationary states is made by , @xmath487 and the only one point @xmath488 satisfies the condition .",
    "long - range correlation is not generated .",
    "the rotational invariant three - dimensional space is compact but the lorentz invariant four - dimensional space is non - compact .",
    "so it is quite natural for the non - relativistic system not to have the long - range correlation that the relativistic system has .",
    "the light - cone singularity is the peculiar property of the relativistic system .",
    "heisenberg uncertainty relation is slightly modified in the wave along the light cone .",
    "the neutrino wave function behaves at large - distance along the light - cone region in the form @xmath489 where @xmath490 has no dependence on the distance @xmath491 .",
    "consequently the uncertainty relation between the energy width @xmath492 and the time interval @xmath348 becomes @xmath493 the ratio @xmath494 is of the order @xmath495 and @xmath348 becomes macroscopic even if the energy width @xmath492 is microscopic of order 100 [ mev ] .",
    "for instance if the pion compton wave length , @xmath496 , is used for the microscopic length , then @xmath497 becomes @xmath498 which is about the distance between the pion source and the near detector in fact .",
    "so interference effect of the present paper appears in this distance and is observable using the apparatus of much smaller size .",
    "the position - dependent probability was computed easily with the use of the wave packet representation .",
    "any representation is equivalent to plane waves as far as the whole complete set of functions is used .",
    "the ordinary probability of the transition process is defined from the states at @xmath107 .",
    "the normal scattering amplitude is the overlap between the in - state at @xmath499 and out - state at @xmath500 , and the space - time coordinates are integrated from @xmath501 to @xmath502 and the energy and momentum of the final state is the same as that of the initial state .",
    "hence in the pion decay , the momentum of the muon in the final state of the ordinary scattering experiments are bounded .",
    "so the infinite momentum is not included in the muon of the final state . from these amplitudes , the amplitudes and probability at the finite - time interval are neither computable nor obtained . in the wave packet formalism , on the other hand , it is possible to compute the amplitude and probability at finite - time interval directly .",
    "energy and momentum conservation is slightly violated in this amplitude and the states of infinite momentum couple and give the light - cone singularity to the correlation function @xmath503 . the contribution from these states vanishes at infinite time and these states do not contribute to the probability measured at infinite distance , i.e. , ordinary s - matrix .",
    "thus the light - cone singularity gave the interference term , which ended up as the finite - time interval effect of the neutrino probability .",
    "wave packet formalism gives new information that is not calculable in the standard scattering amplitude .",
    "hence our calculation does not contradict with the ordinary calculation of the s - matrix in momentum representation but has advantage of giving a new universal physical quantity directly .",
    "since characteristic small phase of the relativistic wave along the light cone and the light - cone singularity are derived from lorentz invariance , there would be similar effect if there exists other light particle .",
    "axion is a possible candidate of light particle and might show the long - distance interference phenomenon .",
    "in this paper we ignored higher order effects such as pion life time and pion mean free path in studying the quantum effects .",
    "we will study these problems and other large scale physical phenomena of low energy neutrinos in subsequent papers .",
