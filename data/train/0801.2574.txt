    "in this paper we propose a continuum method for dealing with cells that move , proliferate and interact via adhesion .",
    "this problem arises in models for wound healing @xcite and tumor growth @xcite .",
    "it is easy to formulate a discrete model for these processes @xcite .",
    "however , proceeding to the continuum limit is non - trivial @xcite .",
    "consider first a simple discrete model for diffusion and proliferation .",
    "each lattice site can be empty or once occupied . at each time step ,",
    "a particle is picked at random .",
    "then it can either jump to a neighboring empty site , or proliferate there ( a new particle is born ) .",
    "we can ask for is the continuum analog of this model ?",
    "it was shown @xcite that for _ small _ proliferation rates the propagating fronts in this discrete system can be described by the fisher - kolmogorov equation @xcite ( fk ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( local ) cell density , @xmath2 is the cell diffusion coefficient , and @xmath3 is the rate of proliferation @xcite .",
    "( [ fisher_eq ] ) admits solutions in a form of propagating fronts , but the velocity selection is a nontrivial problem .",
    "there is a range of possible velocities ; initially sufficiently localized density profiles develop into propagating fronts with the  critical \" velocity , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "next consider a discrete model which includes diffusion and cell - cell adhesion , but not proliferation .",
    "when a particle is picked at random , the probability to jump decreases with the number of nearest neighbors , to take into account cell - cell adhesion @xcite .",
    "this scheme can be mapped into the ising model @xcite , by identifying an empty site with spin down , and an occupied site with spin up .",
    "there is a simple relation between the average density , @xmath1 , and the average magnetization , @xmath5 , in the ising model : @xmath6 .",
    "the number of particles is fixed because there is no proliferation , and there are nearest - neighbor interactions between particles . above the critical strength of cell - cell adhesion ( or below a critical temperature in the ising model ) , the homogeneous state becomes unstable , which leads to phase separation between high density clusters and a dilute gas of particles .",
    "the dynamics of phase separation and coarsening ( where larger clusters grow at the expense of smaller ones ) is usually described by the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite , a version of this equation can be derived directly from the microscopic model @xcite .",
    "we can easily add proliferation to this lattice model @xcite , so that we have diffusion , proliferation , and cell - cell adhesion . in this paper",
    "we suggest that the proper candidate for a continuum description is a cahn - hilliard equation with a proliferation term added , the gch equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present both discrete and continuum models which include diffusion , proliferation , and cell - cell adhesion and present a general phase diagram . section 3",
    "describes the front propagation problem for subcritical adhesion .",
    "section 4 focuses on a supercritical adhesion both for zero and nonzero proliferation .",
    "section 5 includes a brief discussion and summary of our results .",
    "we review the discrete model for diffusion , proliferation , and cell - cell adhesion @xcite .",
    "consider a square two - dimensional lattice in a channel geometry .",
    "the lattice distance is assumed to be equal to cell diameter , taking into account hard - core exclusion .",
    "initially , we put cells into the left part of the channel .",
    "we take @xmath7 to measure distance along the channel .",
    "a cell is picked at random , and one of the four neighboring sites is also picked at random . if this site is empty , the cell can proliferate to this site ( so that a new cell is born there ) , or migrate there .",
    "we denote the probability for proliferation by @xmath3 .",
    "cell - cell adhesion is represented by a probability for migration that decreases with the number of nearest neighbors : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the adhesion parameter , and @xmath10 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the case @xmath11 means no adhesion and reduces to the model of refs .",
    "@xcite . for nonzero @xmath12",
    ", it is much harder to a cell to diffuse if it has many neighbors . after each step time",
    "is advanced by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the current number of cells .    _ without _ proliferation the model can be mapped into the ising model , as we pointed out in @xcite . in",
    "this mapping the adhesion parameter @xmath12 is identified with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature , @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath18 is the coupling strength in the magnetic model , and the average density @xmath1 is identified with @xmath19 , where @xmath5 is the average magnetization .",
    "the mapping is possible because our dynamical rules satisfy detailed balance .",
    "therefore , the statics of our model is the same as in the ising model . by statics , we mean a phase diagram @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 in our case ) which has stable and unstable regions . in the stable region , a homogeneous state ( with uniformly distributed cells )",
    "remains homogeneous ; in contrast , in the unstable region phase separation occurs and large clusters are formed .",
    "the two - dimensional ising model was solved by onsager @xcite , and the curve @xmath22 , which separates the stable and unstable regions , is known ( see fig .  [ threshold ] ) .",
    "in our case the threshold is given by the critical adhesion parameter @xmath23 as a function of average density @xmath1 : @xmath24^{1/8}. \\label{onsager}\\ ] ] the unstable region corresponds to @xmath25 , so for supercritical adhesion there is a phase separation and large clusters are formed .",
    "interestingly , even if we start with @xmath26 , the initially homogeneous state can become unstable when one turns on proliferation , which leads to phase separation and clustering .      to describe the coarse - grained dynamics of the discrete model",
    ", we take a continuum approach .",
    "a model equation , which describes the dynamics of phase separation with conserved order parameter ( without proliferation ) is the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite .",
    "we now formulate the gch equation by adding a proliferation term : @xmath27 where @xmath1 is the local density , @xmath28 is the local free energy , and @xmath3 is the rate of proliferation . the gradient term in the total free energy functional is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath18 represents interatomic interactions ( for example , the coupling strength in the ising model ) .",

    "the mapping @xmath31 explains the @xmath32 coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) .",
    "usually , the mean field form of the local free energy is assumed : @xmath33    figure [ free_energy ] shows the local free energy both for subcritical and supercritical adhesion .",
    "the only extremum ( minimum ) of @xmath34 for subcritical adhesion is at @xmath35 , so the homogeneous state is stable . for supercritical adhesion ,",
    "the extremum at @xmath35 becomes a maximum , the homogeneous state is no longer stable , and two new minima appear , with the densities given by eq .",
    "( [ onsager ] ) .    the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) are chosen in such a way that the free energy functional satisfies several important conditions .",
    "first , we demand that the phase transition threshold is exact ( and not its mean field approximation ) as given by eq .",
    "( [ onsager ] ) .",
    "second , as the adhesion parameter @xmath12 tends to zero , @xmath37 should go to zero . then",
    "( [ cahn ] ) transforms into the fk equation .",
    "in addition , the diffusion coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ fisher_eq ] ) should be @xmath38 ( as can be derived from the discrete model without adhesion @xcite ) , so that @xmath39 .",
    "we chose the following expressions : @xmath40^{1/4}\\,\\frac{c(q)}{q_{cr}^{1/4 } } , \\label{constants}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the only restriction on the function @xmath41 is that it should tend to unity when @xmath12 goes to zero .",
    "this function will be used to fit the continuum results with results of discrete simulations .",
    "note that the theoretical analysis is performed for the general form of local free energy and the specific relations ( [ constants ] ) are used only when comparing theoretical predictions with numerical simulations .    in the next section we consider the regime of subcritical adhesion and",
    "focus on front propagation .",
    "initially , we put cells into the left part of the channel ; @xmath7 measures the distance along the channel . in the initial state",

    "the selection rule is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ polinom3 ] .",

    "for smaller velocity these two roots become complex , which is not allowed as it results in an oscillatory behavior of the density in the tail region .    to test these predictions , we performed numerical simulations of the eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) .",
    "we used the third order runge - kutta method , with a mesh size @xmath57 , and a time step @xmath58 .",
    "initial conditions were localized : @xmath47 ahead of the front , @xmath59 behind the front , and the interface had the form @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "simulations confirm that the front velocity tends to the value given by eq .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) becomes invalid when @xmath3 ( or @xmath12 ) are large enough , so that @xmath61 becomes negative . in this case",
    "the characteristic equation ( [ polinom ] ) has two real roots [ one negative ( @xmath62 ) and one positive ( @xmath63 ) ] and two complex conjugate roots with negative real part ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "therefore , the density in the tail region is oscillatory and becomes negative , which is forbidden .",
    "this is an inherent feature of the time - dependent eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) .",

    "a similar effect occurs in the extended fisher - kolmogorov equation ( efk ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in some region of parameters localized initial conditions can not develop into a uniformly translating front solution .",
    "instead , for sufficiently sharp initial conditions one has an _ envelope front _ :",
    "a moving front creates a periodic array of kinks behind it @xcite .",
    "these oscillations between @xmath59 and @xmath65 occur due to the cubic nonlinearity in the reaction term of the efk equation . in our case",
    ", @xmath65 is not a fixed point , so negative perturbation are not stabilized ( in fact , numerical simulations of eq .",

    "this problem is to demand @xmath67 when solving eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) . in this case , the density profile is not analytic , as in problems with compact support : the density becomes zero at some @xmath68 and remains zero for @xmath69 .",
    "this profile propagates with a well defined velocity , see fig .  [ comparison ] .",
    "we believe that this is the only type of solution which can be chosen in this regime .",

    "the situation for @xmath25 is more complicated . as before , we start with a sharp front : @xmath59 for @xmath42 and @xmath47 for @xmath70 .",
    "it turns out there is a nontrivial and long - lived transient behavior @xcite , which we analyze using discrete and continuum approaches .",
    "we first consider @xmath71 , @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ density_sup ] shows a time series of density profile . to obtain the profiles , we averaged the density over the channel width and over many realizations .",
    "one realization is shown in fig .  [ discrete ] .",
    "a long - lived transient occurs before the propagating front is formed .",
    "an inset shows a magnified picture of the density profile for early time .",
    "an interesting feature is the secondary density peak .",
    "this peak occurs due to phase separation and cluster formation in the low - density invasive region . at later times the main front builds up and catches the isolated clusters .",
    "the same feature is present in the continuum approach : fig .",
    "[ cahn_q9a0003 ] shows a time series of density profiles from numerical solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) .",
    "the transient behavior with a secondary density peak occurs due to the slow ( nonexponential ) decay of the tail , which occurs only for supercritical adhesion . for @xmath72",
    ", there are two competing processes : the ( slow ) propagation of the front and relatively fast formation of the secondary peak on the slowly decaying tail .",
    "this slowly decaying tail also exists for zero proliferation . in order to gain some insights into its formation",

    "figure  [ relaxation_d ] shows the tails of two density profiles calculated from the discrete model . as before , we averaged over the channel width and over many realizations .",

    "the same relaxation dynamics occurs in the continuum model .",
    "this behavior can be easily explained .",
    "considering the small - density region ( the tail ) , we can neglect the @xmath78 term in eq .",

    "then , substituting @xmath79 into eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) , we have : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the derivative with respect to @xmath82 . to solve this equation we need to specify two boundary conditions at @xmath83 .",
    "the first one is just @xmath84 ( the low density stable phase )",

    "an inset shows that these profiles ( the tails ) corresponding to different times coincide when measured as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "the asymptotics computed from eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) is in an excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "this self - similar behavior means that the decay rate is inversely proportional to @xmath87 , so it becomes lower with time .",
    "this is the base of the formation of secondary density peak in the transient regime for nonzero proliferation .",
    "in this work we formulated and examined a continuum model for motile and proliferative cells , which experience cell - cell adhesion . we describe collective behavior of the cells by using a modified cahn - hilliard equation with an additional proliferation term .",
    "we identified and analyzed different parameter regimes : front propagation for subcritical adhesion , nontrivial transient regime for supercritical adhesion and nonzero proliferation .",
    "the results of the continuum description in various regimes are compared with the results of a discrete model @xcite .",
    "the continuum approach we used is phenomenological .",
    "it is presently unknown how to proceed from the microscopic lattice model to a macroscopic continuum description even without proliferation .",
    "one way is to use the mean field approximation @xcite , which neglects fluctuations .",
    "however , even the statics , namely the phase diagram , fig .  [ threshold ] , in the mean field approximation is very different from the exact solution .",
    "we have taken another approach , choosing free energy functional that includes exact statics in it .",
    "this allows us to compare the results of continuum simulations with the results of discrete model .",
    "the results of continuum theory are in a qualitative agreement with discrete simulations in a wide region of parameters , in particular for the velocity of front propagation in subcritical regime .",
    "the continuum approach reproduced a secondary density peak formation in the transient regime .",
    "however , there are important quantitative differences .",
    "discrete simulations show that the high density part of the profile diffuses much more slowly than the low density part . at later times",
    "this leads to much smoother fronts than in the continuum simulations .",
    "there is no symmetry between particles and holes ( occupied and empty sites ) in the discrete model @xcite .",
    "we could introduce a density - dependent mobility to take this effect into account in the continuum description .",
    "for example , one can consider the following expression for mobility : @xmath88 , or similar forms where @xmath89 is a decreasing function of density @xcite .",
    "the modified cahn - hilliard equation admits solutions in the form of propagating fronts .",
    "we postulated that the velocity selection procedure is similar to that of the fk equation and found a critical velocity , eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the time - dependent eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) confirmed this result .",
    "however , the expression for critical velocity becomes invalid in some region of parameters .",
    "nevertheless , demanding @xmath90 we can still solve eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) numerically and observe propagating fronts with a well - defined velocity , see fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "this problem still needs to be clarified .",
