    "within recent years , the quantum theory of information and communication has undergone a dramatic evolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "major progress has been made toward the extension to the quantum regime of the classical theory of information pioneered by shannon  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the use of _ quantum _ communication channels in order to transmit not only classical information but also intact quantum states ( or _ quantum _ information ) has received a considerable amount of attention , following the proof of the quantum analog of shannon s fundamental theorem for noiseless coding by schumacher  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the von neumann entropy plays the role of a quantum information - theoretic entropy in the sense that it characterizes the minimum amount of quantum resources ( e.g. , number of quantum bits ) that is necessary to code an ensemble of quantum states with an asymptotically vanishing distortion in the absence of noise .",
    "this result suggests that a general quantum theory of information , paralleling shannon theory , can be developed based on this concept .",
    "while such a full theory does not exist as of yet , a great deal of effort has been devoted to this issue over the last few years , and several fundamental results have been obtained , ranging from entanglement - based communication schemes  @xcite to quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite . in particular , a substantial amount of work has been devoted recently to the transmission of arbitrary states ( or quantum information ) through _ noisy _ quantum channels ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a quantum state processed by such a channel undergoes _ decoherence _ by interacting with an external system or environment , which effects an alteration of quantum information . a natural question that arises in this context concerns the possibility of transmitting quantum information _ reliably _ , in spite of quantum noise , if it is suitably encoded as sequences of quantum bits in analogy with the standard construction used for classical channels .",
    "more specifically , a fundamental issue is to understand the quantum analog of shannon s noisy channel coding theorem and to define the _ capacity _ of a noisy quantum channel , i.e. , an upper limit to the amount of quantum information that can be processed with an arbitrarily high fidelity .",
    "while several attempts have been made to define a quantum analog of shannon mutual information that would be a natural candidate for such a quantum measure of capacity ( see the concepts of coherent information  @xcite or von neumann mutual entropy  @xcite ) , the problem of characterizing in general the capacity of a noisy quantum channel is still unsolved .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further clarify the description of noisy quantum channels centered on the von neumann mutual entropy ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown recently that a consistent information - theoretic framework that closely parallels shannon s construction can be developed , based on von neumann _ conditional _ and _ mutual _ entropies  @xcite .",
    "the central peculiarity of this framework is that it involves _ negative _ conditional entropies in order to account for quantum non - local correlations between entangled variables .",
    "this is in contrast with shannon information theory in which marginal and conditional entropies are all non - negative quantities .",
    "negative quantum conditional entropies simply reflect the non - monotonicity of the von neumann entropy  @xcite ( the entropy of a composite system can be lower than that of its components if the latter are entangled ) .",
    "the resulting information - theoretic formalism provides grounds for the quantum extension of the usual algebraic relations between shannon entropies in multipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , many concepts of shannon theory can be straightforwardly translated to the quantum regime by extending the range for quantum ( conditional and mutual ) entropies with respect to the classical one in order to encompass entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this is very helpful in analyzing quantum information processes in a _",
    "unified _ framework , paralleling shannon theory .",
    "for example , entanglement - based quantum communication processes  @xcite , quantum channels  @xcite , and quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite can be described along these lines .    in this paper , we focus on the application of this information - theoretic framework to the issue of finding upper bounds on the capacity of quantum codes and quantum channels . in section",
    "ii , we outline the general treatment of noisy quantum channels based on quantum entropies  @xcite , and extend it to the characterization of consecutive uses of a quantum memoryless channel ( cf . the notions of one - symbol and average loss explained in section iid ) .",
    "this provides a simple framework to consider _ block coding _ with quantum channels .",
    "note that , just as in shannon information theory , quantum entropic considerations alone do not result in _ constructive _ methods for building codes .",
    "rather , they are useful to derive bounds on what can possibly be achieved or not , from basic principles . accordingly",
    ", we analyze in section iii several upper bounds ( based on the singleton bound on quantum codes  @xcite ) for standard quantum channels such as the quantum erasure or depolarizing channel .",
    "this confirms bounds on the quantum capacity that were derived otherwise , but places this problem in a unified context .",
    "finally , we examine in section iv the extension of this quantum entropic treatment of noisy quantum channels to the case where an auxiliary _ classical _ channel is available .",
    "quantum teleportation appears then as a special case of this construction when no block coding is applied .",
    "let us start by summarizing the basic definitions that will be useful in the rest of this paper when considering noisy quantum channels .",
    "the entropy of a quantum system @xmath2 ( of arbitrary dimension ) is defined as the von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath3 that characterizes the state of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath4 \\equiv -{\\rm tr}(\\rho_x \\log_2 \\rho_x)\\ ] ] it can be viewed as the uncertainty about @xmath2 in the sense that it measures ( asymptotically ) the minimum number of quantum bits ( qubits ) necessary to specify @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this definition can be extended to the notions of _ conditional _ and _ mutual _ von neumann entropies , based on a simple parallel with their classical counterparts which is motivated in  @xcite . for a bipartite system @xmath5 characterized by @xmath6 ,",
    "the _ conditional _ von neumann entropy is @xmath7 while the _ mutual _ von neumann entropy is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is calculated from @xmath6 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are obtained from the reduced density operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "subadditivity of quantum entropies implies @xmath14 , where the equality holds if @xmath2 and @xmath15 are independent ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) .",
    "note that , when @xmath17 ( i.e. , the joint system @xmath5 is in a pure state ) , we have @xmath18 as a consequence of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "this property will be useful in the following .",
    "several quantum entropies can also be defined for characterizing _",
    "multipartite _ quantum systems .",
    "consider , for instance , a tripartite system @xmath19 .",
    "the von neumann conditional mutual entropy ( of @xmath2 and @xmath15 , conditionally on @xmath20 ) can be defined as @xmath21 in perfect analogy with the classical expressions .",
    "note that the strong subadditivity of quantum entropies implies @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "we can also define the von neumann _ ternary _ mutual entropy as @xmath23 note that , if @xmath24 ( i.e. , the ternary system is in a pure state ) , then @xmath25  @xcite , or , equivalently , @xmath26 , a property which is very useful in the analysis of quantum channels . also , _",
    "chain rules _ for quantum entropies can be written , such as @xmath27 which parallel the classical relations  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for building such a quantum entropic framework is that it provides an _ information - theoretic _ formulation of quantum entanglement in multipartite systems , unified with shannon s description of classical correlation .",
    "it is an extension of shannon s formalism beyond its original range , as reflected for example by the fact that the quantum mutual entropy can reach _ twice _ the maximum value allowed for classical entropies  @xcite , that is , @xmath28\\ ] ] this factor 2 appears in many quantum information - theoretic relations ( see below ) , and originates from the araki - lieb inequality for quantum entropies  @xcite .",
    "let us now outline the entropic treatment of a noisy quantum channel ( see also ref .",
    "such a treatment explicitly displays the correspondence with the standard description of noisy classical channels ( see appendix a ) , thereby unifying classical and quantum channels .",
    "our description involves three quantum systems of arbitrary dimensions : @xmath29 ( the quantum system whose processing by the channel is concerned ) , @xmath30 ( a `` reference '' system which @xmath29 is initially entangled with ) , and @xmath31 ( an external system or environment which @xmath29 is interacting with in the noisy channel ) .",
    "more specifically , we assume that @xmath29 is initially entangled with @xmath30 , so that the joint state of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the _ pure _ state @xmath32 .",
    "we may as well regard @xmath29 as a quantum source , being initially in a mixed state @xmath33 ( realized by a given ensemble of quantum states associated with some probability distribution ) .",
    "the `` purification '' of @xmath33 into @xmath32 can always achieved by extending the hilbert space @xmath34 to @xmath35 , so that we have @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding reduced von neumann entropies are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is called the _ source entropy_. in the dual picture where an _ arbitrary _ pure state of @xmath29 ( rather than entanglement ) is sent through the channel , @xmath38 then measures the `` arbitrariness '' of @xmath29 ( it can be viewed as the average number of quantum bits that are to be processed by the channel in order to transmit the state of @xmath29 ) . in what follows , we prefer to consider a quantum input @xmath29 that is entangled with @xmath30 , so that the preservation of entanglement  rather than of arbitrary states  will be the central feature of a quantum transmission channel .",
    "the initial _ mutual entropy _ to be transmitted is thus @xmath39 that is , _ twice _ the source entropy .",
    "when it is processed by the channel , @xmath29 interacts with @xmath31 ( assumed to be initially in a pure state @xmath40 ) according to the unitary transformation @xmath41 , inducing _",
    "decoherence_. this describes the most general ( trace - preserving ) operation of a quantum channel that is allowed by quantum mechanics . roughly speaking , the resulting _ noisy _ quantum channel is such that , typically , only a fraction of the initial entanglement with @xmath30 can be recovered after having been processed by the channel ( the rest of the entanglement with @xmath30 is lost , in the sense that it is transferred to the environment ) .",
    "more specifically , the decohered quantum system after interaction with @xmath31 , denoted as @xmath42 , is in the state @xmath43 where @xmath33 is the initial state of @xmath29 ( with source entropy @xmath38 ) .",
    "the completely positive linear map @xmath44 corresponds to the `` quantum operation '' performed by the noisy channel  @xcite .",
    "after such an environment - induced decoherence , the joint system @xmath45 is in the state @xmath46 ( the primes refer to the systems _ after _ decoherence ) .",
    "note that , as the reference is not involved in decoherence , we have @xmath47 .    0.25 cm    [ fig_diagram ] -0.25 cm    the entropy diagram of @xmath45 depends on three parameters , the von neumann _ mutual _ entropy ( or the quantum information ) @xmath48 , the _ loss _",
    "@xmath49 , and the _ noise _ @xmath50 , these quantities being defined in analogy with their classical counterparts : @xmath51 the classical correspondence can be made fully explicit by including an environment in the description of a classical channel , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the second equality in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_lll ] ) and ( [ eq_nnn ] ) has no classical analog , and results from the vanishing of the ternary mutual entropy @xmath52 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "physically , the quantum information @xmath48 corresponds to the residual mutual entropy between the decohered quantum output @xmath42 and the reference system @xmath30 that purifies the quantum input @xmath29 .",
    "the loss @xmath49 is the mutual entropy that has arisen between the environment after decoherence @xmath53 and the reference system @xmath30 , while the noise @xmath50 is the mutual entropy between the decohered quantum output @xmath42 and the environment @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 can be written as a function of reduced entropies only , without explicitly involving the environment @xmath31 in the discussion , by making use of the schmidt decomposition of the state of @xmath45 , namely @xmath54 : @xmath55 it can also be shown that these three quantities are in fact independent of the choice of the reference system @xmath30 whenever the latter purifies the quantum input @xmath29 , so that they provide a most concise entropic characterization of information flow in the channel .",
    "they depend in general on the channel input ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) _ and _ on the quantum operation performed by the channel ( i.e. , the completely positive trace - preserving map on @xmath29 that is specified by @xmath41 in the joint space of @xmath29 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this exactly parallels the situation for the analog classical quantities .",
    "the information @xmath48 , loss @xmath49 , and noise @xmath50 of a classical channel of input @xmath2 and output @xmath15 ( see appendix a ) indeed depend on the input distribution @xmath56 and on the channel `` operation '' characterized by @xmath57 .    among these three quantities ,",
    "only @xmath48 and @xmath49 are relevant as far as ( forward ) information transmission through the channel is concerned ( the noise @xmath50 plays a role in the description of the `` reverse '' channel , just as for classical channels ) . indeed , information processing is characterized by the balance between the von neumann mutual entropy and the loss , these two quantities always summing to _ twice _ the source entropy : @xmath58 the mutual entropy @xmath59 represents the amount of the initial mutual entropy with respect to @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) that has been processed by the channel , while the loss @xmath61 corresponds to the fraction of it that is unavoidably lost in the environment . if the channel is _ lossless _ ( @xmath62 ) , then @xmath63 , so that the interaction with the environment can be perfectly `` undone '' , and the initial entanglement of @xmath29 can be fully recovered by an appropriate decoding  @xcite .",
    "( equivalently , this means that an arbitrary initial state of @xmath29 can be recovered without error . )",
    "this can be understood by noting that @xmath30 does not become entangled _ directly _ with the environment in a lossless channel , but only via the output @xmath42 ( see fig .  [ fig_diagram ] when @xmath62 ) .",
    "an operation on @xmath42 only ( namely , the decoding operation ) is enough to transfer the entanglement with @xmath53 ( measured by the noise @xmath50 ) to an ancilla , while preserving the entanglement @xmath60 with @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if @xmath62 , a perfect transmission of information ( _ including _ quantum information ) can be achieved through the channel by applying an appropriate decoding . when @xmath64 , on the other hand , no information at all ( classical _ or _",
    "quantum ) can be processed by the channel .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the quantum depolarizing channel with @xmath65 ( see section  iiid ) . in between these limiting cases , classical information ( and ,",
    "up to some _ restricted _ extent , quantum information ) can be reliably transmitted at the expense of a decrease in the rate by making use of _ block coding_. the analysis of such a transmission of quantum information immune to noise is the main focus of this paper .    for completeness , let us mention that a channel with @xmath66 is the quantum analog of a _",
    "channel  @xcite , that is , a channel where the input fully determines the output ( see appendix a ) . the quantum output @xmath42 is indeed not directly entangled with @xmath53 but only via @xmath30 , which implies that its entanglement with @xmath30 remains intact ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] when @xmath66 ) .",
    "this does not mean , however , that perfect error correction is achievable , as an operation on the reference @xmath30 is needed to recover the initial entanglement @xmath60 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a channel which is both lossless ( @xmath62 ) and deterministic ( @xmath66 ) is called _ noiseless _ ; its action on @xmath29 is the identity operator ( or any _ fixed _ unitary operator ) .",
    "for example , the overall channel including a noisy quantum channel along with the encoder and decoder is obviously noiseless if perfect error correction is achieved .",
    "( in other words , the decoder is used to eliminate the quantum noise @xmath67 by transferring the entanglement with @xmath31 to an ancilla , which then makes the overall channel noiseless _ provided _ that @xmath62 . )",
    "it is worth noting here that the noise @xmath50 and the loss @xmath49 play symmetric roles when considering the `` reverse '' channel obtained by interchanging the input and output .",
    "( this is true for classical channels as well . )",
    "more specifically , @xmath50 and @xmath48 always sum to twice the _ output _ entropy , @xmath68 in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq_i+l ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath50 plays the role of the loss of the reverse channel , as shown in sec .",
    "the above entropies for a noisy quantum channel can be shown to fulfill several properties , akin to classical ones , which make them reasonable quantum measures of information , loss , or noise ( see also ref .",
    "first , the quantum mutual entropy @xmath48 can be shown to be _ concave _ in the input @xmath33 for a fixed channel , i.e. , a fixed quantum operation @xmath69 or a fixed @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , any local maximum of @xmath48 is the absolute maximum , that is , the von neumann capacity of the channel .",
    "this parallels the concavity of the shannon mutual entropy @xmath70 in the input probability distribution @xmath56 for a fixed channel , i.e. , fixed @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath48 is _ convex _ in the output @xmath71 for a fixed input @xmath33 .",
    "this property will be used in the next section when considering a `` probabilistic '' channel ( the effective channel resulting from the probabilistic use of a family of channels ) .",
    "it is the quantum analog of the property that the information @xmath70 processed by a classical channel is a convex function of @xmath57 for a fixed @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these two properties are simple to prove by reexpressing the von neumann mutual entropy @xmath48 as @xmath72 or as @xmath73 if the input @xmath33 is a convex combination of density operators while the channel is fixed , it is easy to see that @xmath74 and therefore @xmath75 are also convex combinations ( as the channel operation is linear ) . since the conditional entropy @xmath76 is concave in a convex combination of @xmath75 while @xmath77 is concave in @xmath71  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq_proofconcavity ] ) implies the _ concavity _ of the quantum mutual entropy @xmath48 in the input for a fixed channel .",
    "the second property can be proven the same way by noting that , if we have a `` probabilistic '' channel  a convex combination of quantum channels  acting on a fixed input , then @xmath78 is a convex combination of density operators while @xmath79 is constant .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq_proofconvexity ] ) together with the concavity of the conditional entropy @xmath80 in a convex combination of @xmath78 implies that the quantum mutual entropy @xmath48 is _ convex _ in the output for a fixed input .",
    "a third important property is that the mutual entropy @xmath48 and the quantum loss @xmath49 are _ subadditive _ when considering a channel made of several independent quantum channels used _ in parallel_. this will be shown when analyzing quantum block coding ( cf .",
    "iid ) . finally , it can be proved that @xmath48 obeys ( forward and reverse ) data - processing inequalities when considering chained quantum channels . if we chain two channels by using the output of the first as an input for the second ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_dataproc ] ) , the total ( 1 + 2 ) channel @xmath81 is characterized by @xmath82 since we can regard the two environments @xmath53 and @xmath83 as a global environment for this total channel .",
    "0.50 cm    [ fig_dataproc ] -0.25 cm    using the chain rule for quantum mutual entropies @xmath84 , and remembering that @xmath85 as a result of strong subadditivity , we obtain @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the loss of the first channel while @xmath88 is the loss of the total channel . thus , the loss can only increase by further processing of quantum information in the second channel .",
    "since @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we obtain the _ forward _ data - processing inequality @xmath91 implying that the mutual entropy of the total channel can not exceed the one of the first channel .",
    "this is the quantum analog of @xmath92 for chained classical channels @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "now , if we use the chain rule @xmath94 together with strong subadditivity , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the noise of the second channel while @xmath97 is the noise of the total channel . as @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", we obtain the _ reverse _ data - processing inequality @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mutual entropy processed by the second channel .",
    "( note that the `` reference '' system that purifies the input @xmath42 of the second channel is @xmath102 . )",
    "this parallels the classical inequality @xmath103 for chained channels  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq_lossprocess ] ) and ( [ eq_noiseprocess ] ) emphasize that the loss @xmath49 and the noise @xmath50 play a symmetric role in this entropic description if one interchanges the input and the output of the quantum channel ( `` time - reversal '' ) , just as for classical channels .",
    "this is reflected by the symmetry between the forward and the reverse data - processing inequalities .",
    "the central idea of classical error correction by block coding is to introduce _ correlations _ between the bits that make a block , in order to have redundancy in the transmitted flow of data .",
    "this can make the transmission asymptotically immune to errors , up to some level of noise . in quantum error - correcting codes , the qubits that form a block are _ entangled _ in a specific way , so that a partial alteration due to decoherence can be recovered  @xcite . even though entanglement gives rise to some qualitatively new features ( see  @xcite for a detailed analysis ) , the objective is similar .",
    "namely , when block coding is used , i.e. , when say @xmath104 `` logical '' qubits are encoded into blocks of @xmath0 `` physical '' qubits , it is possible to achieve a situation where the _ overall _ loss of the joint ( @xmath0-bit ) channel is arbitrarily small , while the loss for individual qubits ( for each use of the channel ) is finite . in analogy with the classical construction , if blocks of @xmath0 qubits that are initially entangled with respect to @xmath30 ( with a mutual entropy @xmath105 ) can be transmitted through the channel with an asymptotically vanishing overall loss , we say that the channel processes @xmath106 bits of entanglement _ per qubit_.",
    "equivalently , the channel is transmitting at a _ rate _ @xmath107 ( on average , @xmath104 arbitrary binary quantum states can be transmitted for @xmath0 transmitted qubits )",
    ". the maximum rate at which quantum information can be reliably sent through the noisy channel is defined as the quantum _",
    "channel capacity_. ( this maximum has to be taken over all possible coding schemes , and for @xmath1 . )",
    "whether a good ( and operational ) definition of such a `` purely quantum '' channel capacity exists is currently an open question . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the issue of finding upper bounds on the rate of perfect quantum information transmission ( and therefore on such a `` purely quantum '' capacity ) .",
    "let us consider the asymptotic use of a quantum discrete memoryless channel , where @xmath0 ( tending to infinity ) qubits are transmitted sequentially .. ] each qubit may decohere due to an environment ( quantum noise ) , the exact interaction depending on the considered noise model .",
    "the important point is that the environment for each qubit is initially _ independent _ of the one interacting with every other qubit .",
    "thus the information process can be viewed as @xmath0 sequential uses of a quantum _ memoryless _ channel ( the environment being `` reset '' after each use ) or , equivalently , as @xmath0 _ parallel _ independent channels processing one qubit each ( see fig .  [ fig_nchannels ] ) . we assume that the set of @xmath0 input symbols ( @xmath108 , ",
    "@xmath109 ) are initially entangled with @xmath30 , so that @xmath110 and @xmath111 . if we consider these @xmath0 symbols as the single input of a joint @xmath0-bit channel @xmath112 , information transmission is described by the mutual entropy @xmath113 and the loss @xmath114 where we have made use of the conservation of entropy imposed by the unitarity of the global interaction with the @xmath0 environments @xmath115 , ",
    "obviously , we have @xmath117 , which is twice the source entropy @xmath38 of the joint channel .    [ fig_nchannels ] -0.25 cm    each individual channel @xmath118",
    "can be described in the same way , noting that each @xmath119 interacts with an environment @xmath120 ( initially in a pure state @xmath40 ) which results in @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the only difference here is that @xmath30 has to be supplemented with all the input @xmath29 s _ except _ @xmath119 in order to purify @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the mutual entropy characterizing the @xmath123-th channel is @xmath124 while the corresponding loss is @xmath125 these quantities can be re - expressed by using the fact that the environments @xmath115 , ",
    "@xmath116 are initially in a product state and that the @xmath119 and @xmath120 interact pairwise .",
    "we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 for each channel , the loss and the mutual entropy sum to twice the source entropy of the channel ( tracing over all the other channels ) : @xmath128 .",
    "the subadditivity of von neumann entropies , @xmath129 and the subadditivity of von neumann conditional entropies @xmath130 combined with eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ltot ] ) and ( [ eq_li ] ) imply that the loss is _ subadditive _ : @xmath131 the same reasoning can be made using eqs .",
    "( [ eq_itot ] ) and ( [ eq_ii ] ) and interchanging the @xmath121 s and @xmath122 s in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_subad1 ] ) and ( [ eq_subad2 ] ) , which results in the equivalent expression for mutual entropies : @xmath132 the latter inequality corresponds to the _ subadditivity _ of the von neumann mutual entropy for parallel channels . finally , using the relation between the loss and the mutual entropy for individual channels and for the joint channel , we obtain @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "equivalently , if we define the _ average _ loss reflects the effective loss _ per qubit",
    "_ processed in the noisy channel , that is , the loss affecting the overall process ( encoding + joint channel viewed as @xmath0 parallel one - bit noisy channels ) divided by the number of physical qubits @xmath0 when @xmath135 .",
    "] of the joint @xmath0-bit channel as @xmath136 for @xmath135 , we see that @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the _ one - symbol _ loss , i.e. , the loss for a single use of an individual channel averaged over all 1-bit channels .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_range ] ) or ( [ eq_range2 ] ) imply that the loss can not increase by using block coding ( using parallel channels ) .",
    "it typically decreases by an amount which is bounded by @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 ) , a quantity related to the entanglement between the input symbols .",
    "( note that @xmath142 if the input symbols are independent . )",
    "the analog construction for a classical channel is presented in appendix a in order to clarify the straightforward classical to quantum correspondence . as an example , let us consider the use of blocks of two qubits . assume also that the two 1-bit channels are identical , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "the _ average _ loss of the joint 2-bit channel , @xmath144 , can be bounded by @xmath145 this explicitly shows that block coding can decrease the average loss only when the symbols are entangled [ i.e. , @xmath146 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq_range ] ) or ( [ eq_range2 ] ) allow us to derive a simple upper bound on the maximum achievable rate by block coding , as a function of the one - symbol loss ( or mutual entropy ) for a single use of the channel .",
    "indeed , only if the lower bound on @xmath49 ( or @xmath147 ) extends to zero ( that is , if @xmath148 ) is it possible that block coding makes the joint channel perfectly immune to noise while each 1-bit channel has a non - vanishing loss .",
    "thus , we have the necessary condition for having a vanishing average loss ( @xmath149 ) : @xmath150 as a consequence , the rate of quantum information transmission through the joint channel , @xmath151 , is bounded from above by _ half _ the averaged _ one - symbol _ mutual entropy for individual channels : @xmath152 thus , the ( averaged ) mutual von neumann entropy characterizing each use of the channel provides an upper bound on the achievable rate of transmission by block coding through the noisy channel . except for the factor 1/2",
    ", this inequality parallels the one for a classical channel ( see appendix a ) .",
    "remember that the quantum capacity of a channel is defined as the maximum rate that can be achieved through the channel ( over all possible input and coding schemes ) with a fidelity arbitrarily close to one .",

    "entropic singleton bounds can be derived in the latter case too , showing that the classical channel does not enhance the quantum capacity ( or an upper bound on it ) , in agreement with what was proven in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the central part of the reasoning consists in calculating a lower bound on the _ average loss _ of the channel ( i.e. , the loss of the joint channel made of @xmath0 consecutive uses of a memoryless channel , divided by the number of processed symbols @xmath135 ) which characterizes the `` quality '' of the transmission .",
    "if the use of block coding makes the joint ( @xmath0-bit ) channel lossless ( i.e. , the average loss is zero ) , then reliable transmission of quantum information is achievable .",
    "this is true even though the _ one - symbol loss _ ( for a single use of the channel ) is non - zero , reflecting the alteration due to noise in each use of the channel .",
    "perfect transmission by block coding is thus possible provided that this lower bound on the average loss is zero or less , which results in an upper bound on the attainable rate .",
    "obviously , there remains much to be done in order to derive better bounds on the rate ( or perhaps the exact capacity ) using such an entropic approach .",

    "however , we obtain a well - known bound on the capacity ( @xmath339 , see  @xcite ) which has been recently shown not to be attainable  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the characterization of the exact quantum capacity of the depolarizing channel is still an open problem , and it is possible that the entropic approach presented here could be further improved .",

    "however , a classical channel can be thought of as a device which processes classical _ correlation _ ( with respect to a reference r ) . if the input @xmath2 is initially fully correlated with a reference @xmath30 , then the residual mutual entropy between the output @xmath15 and @xmath30 is a measure of the amount of correlation ( or information ) transmitted through the channel . for a quantum channel ,",
    "we consider the processing of _ entanglement _ ( with respect to @xmath30 ) rather than correlation , so that the residual mutual entropy between the decohered quantum system @xmath42 ( the quantum output ) and @xmath30 is the interesting quantity .",
    "this makes the classical - quantum correspondence easier to understand .",
    "a noisy classical channel with input @xmath2 and output @xmath15 is characterized by @xmath340 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denote the _ information _ , the _ loss _ , and the _ noise _ , respectively ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "information processing through the channel is measured by the balance between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , these two quantities summing to the source entropy : @xmath341 the loss measures the inherent uncertainty in the process of inferring the input of the channel from the altered output ( decoding ) , that is , the entropy of the input conditional on the output . when the loss @xmath49 is zero ( _ lossless _ channel ) ,",

    "consequently , the loss can not increase by using block coding ( i.e. , using parallel channels with correlated input symbols ) , but it can decrease by an amount which is bounded by @xmath356 . note that @xmath356 vanishes when the input symbols are independent , while a positive value of @xmath356 reflects the correlation between the input symbols .",
    "it is simple to obtain a necessary condition for perfect transmission ( i.e. , with a vanishing overall loss ) by block coding through a noisy channel .",
    "clearly , the condition @xmath357 must be fulfilled for the lower bound on @xmath49 to extend to zero .",
    "therefore , the rate of transmission through the joint channel , @xmath358 is bounded from above by the averaged _ one - symbol _ information of the individual channels : @xmath359 this is related to the weak converse of shannon s noisy coding theorem  @xcite : the transmission can not be perfect ( or lossless , i.e. , @xmath62 ) if the rate of transmission exceeds the ( averaged ) mutual shannon entropy characterizing each use of the channel .",
    "this is consistent with shannon s result that the classical channel capacity is the maximum ( over all input distributions ) of the mutual information between channel input and output for a _ single _ use of the channel .",
