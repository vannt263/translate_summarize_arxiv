    "inclusive decays provide a promising possibility to determine the ckm matrix elements describing the mixing of @xmath5 quark , since a rigorous theoretical treatment of these decays , including nonperturbative effects , is possible . a consideration based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the heavy quark ( hq ) expansion @xcite allows one to connect the rate of the inclusive @xmath2 meson decay with the rate of the @xmath5 quark decay",
    ". an important consequence of the analysis based on the ope is the appearance of the hq binding effects in the integrated rates , both total and semileptonic ( sl ) , of heavy meson decays only in the second order of the hq expansion @xcite .",
    "these second order corrections are expressed in terms of the two hadronic parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the latter are the mesonic matrix elements of the operators of dimension 5 which appear in the ope of the product of the two weak currents .",
    "the differential distributions can be calculated as expansions in inverse powers of hq mass @xmath8 @xcite .    whereas presumably providing quite reliable results for the integrated sl decay rate ,",
    "the ope method encounters difficulties in calculating various differential distributions .",
    "for instance , before comparing the ope - based results for the differential distributions with the true distributions a proper smearing over duality interval is necessary .",
    "there are several reasons which yield complications in the calculation of some differential distributions , arising mostly in the resonance region near zero recoil , namely :    \\1 .",
    "the duality - violating @xmath9 effects ( i.e. the difference between the true distributions and the smeared ope results ) in the differential distributions near zero recoil which originate from the delay in opening different hadronic channels , as noticed in @xcite .",
    "although these effects are cancelled in the integrated sl rate , they can considerably influence the kinematical distributions near the zero recoil point ;    \\2 .",
    "the convergence of the ope series for the differential distributions persists only in the region where the quark produced in the sl decay is sufficiently fast .",
    "this means that the ope can not directly predict distributions in some kinematical regions , such as :    * the photon energy spectrum @xmath10 in the radiative @xmath11 : the window in the photon energy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 turns out to be completely inaccessible within the ope formalism @xcite ; * the lepton energy spectrum @xmath14 at large values of @xmath15 in semileptonic or rare leptonic decays ; * the lepton @xmath0-distributions in sl @xmath16 and rare @xmath17 decays at large @xmath0 near zero recoil ; in this region one encounters both the quark - binding and duality - violating effects .    problems related to the quark - binding effects can be solved in principle by performing proper resummation of the nonperturbative corrections which in practice however leads to the appearance of _ a priori _ unknown distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the quark - binding effects in heavy meson decays was first done in @xcite , where an unknown distribution function of a heavy quark inside the heavy meson was introduced .",
    "evidently , this distribution function is connected with the wave function of the heavy meson which also determines the exclusive transition form factors . to put this connection on a more solid basis , it is reasonable to consider the inclusive and exclusive processes within the same approach .",
    "we argue in this paper that the constituent quark model ( qm ) can be used an efficient tool for calculating differential distributions in inclusive decays of heavy mesons , covering also kinematical regions where ope can not provide a rigorous treatment .",
    "namely , the constituent quark model allows one to take into account quark - binding effects in inclusive heavy meson decays in terms of the meson soft wave function .",
    "the latter describes the heavy meson properties both in exclusive and inclusive processes and thus allows one to consider on the same ground long - distance effects in various kinds of hadronic processes .",
    "quark - model calculations of inclusive distributions are essentially based on the evaluation of the box diagram ( see fig .",
    "1a later on ) by introducing the heavy meson wave function in one way or another .",
    "to illustrate the basic features of such an approach as well as its advantages and limitations it suffices to consider the case of a nonrelativistic ( nr ) potential model with scalar currents .",
    "inclusion of relativistic effects can be then performed .",
    "let us consider a weak transition induced by the scalar current @xmath18 , where both @xmath5 and @xmath19 are heavy . to make the nonrelativistic treatment consistent we assume that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the typical scale of the quark binding effects in the heavy meson . in the nr theory the general expression for the hadronic tensor @xmath22",
    "is reduced to the form @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the full green function corresponding to the the full hamiltonian operator of the @xmath25 system with the total momentum @xmath26 @xmath27    thus , the hadronic tensor is the average of the full @xmath25 green function over the ground state of the full @xmath28 hamiltonian @xmath29 in the rest frame of the @xmath2-meson one has @xmath30 the following relation provides a basis for performing the ope in the nr potential model @xcite @xmath31 + \\frac{\\hat{\\vec k^2}+\\hat v_1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{m_c}- \\frac{1}{m_b}\\right ) -\\frac{\\hat{\\vec k}\\vec q}{m_c}+o\\left(\\frac{\\gamma^3\\delta m}{m_c^3}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and we have assumed the following expansion of the potential @xmath33    starting with ( [ basic - ope ] ) one constructs an ope series using the amplitude of the free @xmath34 quark transition as a zero - order approximation ( hereafter referred to as the standard ope ) . by virtue of the equations of motion , @xmath35 one observes the absence of @xmath9 corrections to the leading order ( lo ) @xmath34 amplitude , so that the corrections emerge only at the @xmath36 order .",
    "being completely reliable for the calculation of the integrated decay rate , this choice of the zero - order approximation turns out to be inconvenient however for calculating differential distributions .",
    "in particular , the distribution in the invariant mass of the produced hadronic system , @xmath1 , becomes very singular and is represented via @xmath37 and its derivatives , such that the @xmath9 corrections are even more singular than the lo result .",
    "this is the price one pays for the choice of the zero - order term .",
    "it is clear that the free - quark transition amplitude is not the unique choice of the zero - order approximation , at least in quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , another structure of the expansion can be obtained if the free @xmath25 green function is used as the zero - order approximation .    in the nr",
    "quantum mechanics the relation between the full and the free green functions is well known and reads @xmath38 or , equivalently , @xmath39 for the heavy quark decay , in most of the kinematical @xmath0-region except for a vicinity of the zero recoil point , the green function @xmath40 behaves as @xmath9 , and , since the matrix elements of the operator @xmath41 remain finite as @xmath42 , the series ( [ exp2 ] ) is an expansion in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "notice that in the nr potential model the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) is fully equivalent to the ope series obtained from ( [ basic - ope ] ) . inserting the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) into the expression for the hadronic tensor @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "( [ wnr ] ) , we come to the series shown in fig 1 .    the lo term is the box diagram of fig .",
    "1a with the free @xmath19 and @xmath44 quarks in the intermediate state .",
    "the corresponding analytical expression reads @xmath45 this is the quantity usually taken into account in qm calculations .",
    "it is easy to see , that the sl decay rate calculation based on the box diagram of fig . 1 only , reproduces the free quark sl decay rate in the hq limit , but should contain also @xmath9 corrections ( see also the general structure of the qm results of ref .",
    "namely , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) term in the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) is the diagram with a single insertion of the potential between the free @xmath19 and @xmath44 quarks ( the diagram of fig .",
    "it has the order @xmath9 and precisely cancels the @xmath9 contribution of the qm box diagram , yielding in this way the absence of the @xmath9 correction in the difference between the decay rates of bound and free heavy quarks .",
    "thus , the qm box - diagram calculation is just the first  order term in an alternative expansion of the full green function : unlike the standard ope series which starts from a single @xmath19-quark in the intermediate state , the qm starts from the free @xmath25 pair which is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath46 hereafter we refer to the expansion of the decay rate based on the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) of the green function as the qm expansion .    summing up",
    ", the quark model provides an alternative @xmath9 expansion with the following properties :    * the box diagram of fig .",
    "1a provides the lo @xmath9 term and reproduces the free - quark decay in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "all other terms contribute only in subleading @xmath9 orders ; * the differential distributions in any @xmath9 order are convergent for almost all allowed @xmath0 , except for the region close to zero recoil ; * before comparing the calculated differential distributions based on the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) with the true distributions in the resonance region a proper smearing over some duality interval is required ; * the @xmath9 correction to the lo term is nonvanishing .    clearly , the properties 1 - 3 are completely equivalent to the standard ope , while the property 4 makes the qm expansion much less convenient than the standard ope , at least for the calculation of the sl decay rate .",
    "however :    * the expansion ( [ exp2 ] ) turns out to be more suitable for the calculation of the differential distributions , e.g. for the calculation of @xmath48 : in this case the lo result ( the box diagram of fig .",
    "1a ) is well - defined in the whole kinematical region as well as the higher order corrections to it .",
    "thus already the box diagram is appropriate for comparison with the experimental @xmath48 at all @xmath1 apart from the resonance region . beyond the resonance region",
    "no additional smearing of the calculated @xmath48 is required .    in full qcd",
    "the situation is of course much more complicated and hadrons are coherent states of infinite number of quarks and gluons . nevertheless , many applications of the constituent quark model have proved the treatment of mesons as bound states of two constituent quarks to provide a reasonable description of their properties . from this viewpoint",
    "the arguments given above remain valid .",
    "namely , the box diagram represents the main contribution to the hadronic tensor which reproduces the free - quark decay in the infinite quark mass limit .",
    "however hadronic tensor calculated from the box diagram contains the @xmath9 term compared with the free - quark decay tensor .",
    "this linear @xmath9 term is known to be cancelled by the @xmath9 order contributions of higher order diagram and to be absent in the full expression . in practice , however the @xmath9 term of the box diagram is not so dangerous : namely , the hadronic tensor calculated from the box diagram , as well as all corrections given by the other graphs , are regular in the whole kinematical region .",
    "thus _ the box diagram should provide a reasonable description already appropriate for comparison with experiment_. moreover , the box - diagram result can be further improved by effectively taking into account the higher order term which kills the @xmath9 correction contained in the box diagram .",
    "we follow this strategy in our analysis and perform a relativistic treatment of quark - binding effects within a constituent quark picture .",
    "our consideration of the quark binding effects in inclusive sl decays is based on the relativistic dispersion formulation of the quark model previously developed for the description of meson transition form factors @xcite . within this approach",
    ", the inclusive decay rates as well as the exclusive hadron transition form factors are given by double spectral representations in terms of the soft meson wave functions .",
    "the double spectral densities of these spectral representations are obtained from the corresponding feynman graphs .",
    "the subtraction terms in spectral representations for exclusive transition form factors are fixed by requiring the structure of the hq expansion in the qm to match the structure of the hq expansion in qcd . in this paper",
    "we proceed along the same lines in inclusive processes .",
    "our main results are the following :    * we construct the double spectral representation of the hadronic tensor within the constituent quark model starting with @xmath49 .",
    "the hadronic tensor is represented in terms of the soft wave function of the @xmath2 meson and the double spectral density of the box diagram .",
    "the hadronic tensor at @xmath50 is obtained by the analytical continuation .",
    "then the @xmath9 expansion of the spectral representation of the decay rate is performed and the lo term is shown to reproduce the free quark decay rate .",
    "the subtraction is defined in such a way that the @xmath9 correction to the sl decay rate is absent .",
    "this corresponds to effectively taking into account other terms beyond the box - diagram approximation which contribute in subleading @xmath9 orders .",
    "moreover an approximate account of the @xmath36 effects of the whole series within the box - diagram expression is possible .",
    "this is done by introducing a phenomenological cut in the double spectral representation of the box - diagram which affects only the differential distributions at large @xmath0 .",
    "this cut brings the size of the @xmath36 corrections in the @xmath51 in full agreement with the ope result and keeps the lo and @xmath9 correction unchanged .",
    "the cut yields differential distributions which are finite also in the endpoint @xmath0-region where the hq expansion series is not properly convergent ; * various differential distributions are calculated in terms of the @xmath2-meson soft wave function .",
    "these distributions are regular in the whole kinematically accessible region and , apart from the resonance region ( where the exact distributions are dominated by single resonances and a proper smearing over the duality intervals is necessary ) , can be directly compared with the observable values .",
    "the main effect of quark - binding upon these distributions is determined unambiguously through the soft wave function , while the @xmath36 corrections depend on the particular details of an approximate account of the higher - order terms in the series ( [ exp2 ] ) . however , in practice these details are not essential due to the following two reasons : first they are numerically small , and second , the size of the @xmath36 corrections in the integrated sl rate is close to the ope result .",
    "so we expect that the size of the @xmath36 corrections is reasonably reproduced also in other quantities ; * we perform numerical estimates of various differential distributions in inclusive decays in terms of the @xmath2-meson wave function known from the description of the exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present necessary formulas for the free - quark decay and also the ope prediction for the total integrated rate up to @xmath36 corrections . in section 3",
    "we construct the dispersion representation for the box diagram at @xmath49 and discuss its analytical continuation to @xmath50 .",
    "section 4 performs the @xmath9 expansion of the hadronic tensor in the quark model , and section 5 presents numerical results for differential distributions .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in the conclusion .",
    "let the effective hamiltonian governing the quark transition @xmath52 with the emission of the particle @xmath53 have the following structure @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes a relevant combination of the dirac matrices .",
    "following notations of ref @xcite for the exclusive form factors , we denote the parent heavy quark @xmath56 also as @xmath57 and the daughter quark @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "a tree - level rate of the free - quark decay initiated by this effective hamiltonian averaged over the polarizations of the initial quark @xmath57 and summed over polarizations of the final quark @xmath59 has the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] thus , integrating the double differential distribution ( [ a8 ] ) over @xmath312 and using ( [ a7 ] ) gives @xmath161 in the form ( [ cut ] ) @xmath313 it is clear that for the calculation of @xmath161 we do not need to know all @xmath314 , but only their linear combination ( [ a7 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , for calculating the electron spectrum @xmath288 we need all the functions @xmath314 .",
    "the latter read @xmath315 where @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 are given by eqs ( 36 - 38 ) of @xcite .",
    "it might be interesting to note that at @xmath49 , and using the reference frame @xmath316 , @xmath317 ( @xmath318 ) one obtains @xmath319 where @xmath320 and @xmath321 are the @xmath322 and @xmath323 components of the spectator quark momentum , respectively .",
    "in the heavy meson one finds @xmath324 although at @xmath50 the interpretation of @xmath284 and @xmath325 in terms of @xmath321 and @xmath320 is not straightforward , the estimates ( [ a11 ] ) remain valid also at @xmath50 .",
    "this means that in @xmath4 decays our @xmath314 s differ only slightly from the corresponding free - quark expressions ."
