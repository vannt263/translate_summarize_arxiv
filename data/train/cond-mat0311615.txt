    "quantum entanglement has become one of the most important issues since the rapid developments in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "much research has been devoted to studying entanglement as induced by a direct interaction between the individual subsystems @xcite .",
    "very recently , a lot of attention has been focused on _ reservoir - induced _",
    "entanglement @xcite with the purpose to shed light on the generation of entanglement , and to better understand quantum decoherence",
    ".    furthermore , shot noise @xcite has been identified as a valuable indicator of particle entanglement in transport experiments.@xcite a well studied example is the doubling of the full shot noise in * s - i - n * tunnel junctions@xcite , where * n * is a normal metal , * s * stands for a superconductor , and * i * is an insulating barrier .",
    "the origin of this enhancement comes from the break - up of the spin - singlet state , which results in a quick transfer of two electrical charges .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate how the dynamics of entangled excitons formed by superradiance can be revealed from the observations of current fluctuations .",
    "a doubled zero - frequency shot noise is found for the case of zero subradiant decay rate .",
    "we relate the particle noise to photon noise by calculating the first order photon coherence function .",
    "furthermore , strong reservoir coupling acts like a continuous measurement , which is shown to suppress the formation of the entanglement , except for the state of maximum entanglement .",
    "these novel features imply that our model provides a new way to examine both the bunching behavior and a zeno - like effect of the reservoir induced entanglement .",
    "the effect appears in double quantum dots embedded inside a _ p - i - n _ junction@xcite .",
    "it involves superradiant  and subradiant decay through two singlet and triplet entangled states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and one ground state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) represents one exciton in dot 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "electron and hole reservoirs coupled to both dots have chemical potentials such that electrons and holes can tunnel into the dot . for the physical phenomena we are interested in ,",
    "the current is assumed to be conducted through dot 1 only ( fig .",
    "therefore , the exciton states @xmath5 ( in dot 2 ) can only be created via the exciton - photon interactions .",
    "the exciton - photon coupling is described by an interaction hamiltonian    @xmath6+h.c.\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the photon operator , @xmath8 is the coupling strength , @xmath9 is the position vector between the two quantum dots . here , @xmath10 is a constant with the unit of the tunneling rate .",
    "the dipole approximation is not used in our calculation since we keep the full @xmath11 terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the coupling of the dot states to the electron and hole reservoirs is described by the standard tunnel hamiltonian    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron operators in the left and right reservoirs , respectively , and @xmath15 denotes one - hole state in dot 1 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 couple the channels @xmath18 of the electron and the hole reservoirs .",
    "here we have neglected the state @xmath19 for convenience .",
    "this can be justified by fabricating a thicker barrier on the electron side so that there is little chance for an electron to tunnel in advance @xcite .",
    "the rates @xmath20 ( electron reservoir )  and @xmath21 ( hole reservoir ) for tunneling between the dot and the connected reservoirs can be calculated from @xmath22 by perturbation theory . in double quantum dots , decay of the excited levels",
    "is governed by collective behavior , i.e. superradiance and subradiance .",
    "the corresponding decay rates for the state @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be obtained from @xmath25 and are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we are then in the position to set up the equations of motion for the time - dependent occupation probabilities",

    "electronic current noise originates from the dynamical fluctuations of the current being away from its average . to study correlations between carriers ,",

    "2 , the fano factor @xmath59is enhanced by a factor of 2 as the dot distance @xmath54 is much smaller than the wavelength ( @xmath60 ) of the emitted photon . to explain this enhancement , we approximate the fano factor in the limit of small subradiant decay rate , i.e. @xmath61where we obtain @xmath62.\\]]this is analogous to the case of the single electron transistor near a cooper pair resonance as discussed recently by choi and co - workers @xcite . in their calculations , the fano factor is expressed as @xmath63 in the strong dephasing limit ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the josephson coupling energy )",
    ", the zero - frequency shot noise is also enhanced by a factor of 2 .",
    "since the doubled shot noise in josephson junction is attributed to the bunching behavior of cooper pairs ( in singlet state ) , we then conclude the enhancement in our system is also due to the entanglement induced by the photon reservoir .     and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "2 . as can be seen , the value of @xmath74 is equal to that of the one - dot case for @xmath75 ( dashed line ) , while it approaches zero as @xmath76 ( red line ) . in the limit of @xmath77 ,",
    "one observes no photon emission from the double dot system since the exciton is now in its maximum entangled state and does not decay .",
    "this feature implies that photon noise is suppressed by the bunching of excitons , and its behavior is opposite to that for the electronic case @xcite .",
    "now we investigate how the measurement affects the shot noise spectrum . in the usual zeno paradox @xcite , a two - level system ( qubit )",
    "is completely frozen under a series of measurements , whose time interval @xmath78 is much smaller than the memory time of the reservoir . in our model , the presence of the exciton state can be viewed as the excited state , and whether or not the next hole can tunnel in is determined by the occupation of this state .",
    "similar to the quantum zeno effect , the tunneling of holes at the hole - side tunneling rate @xmath21 can be thought as a continuous measurements .",
    "the  interval time ",
    "@xmath78 is then inversely proportional to @xmath79 fig .",
    "3 represents the effects of measurements on the frequency - dependent shot noise spectrum .",
    "the numerical results for the tunneling rate @xmath80 @xmath58 and @xmath81 @xmath82 are demonstrated by solid and dashed curves , respectively . if the subradiant decay rate is set to zero , one obtains the doubled shot noise as mentioned above . without superradiance ,",
    "the values of the fano factor are always below unity as shown by the right inset of fig .",
    "an interesting feature is that the half - width of the spectrum is narrowed for strong measurements ( @xmath80 @xmath58 ) .",
    "if one increases the electron - side tunneling rate @xmath20 , there exists no such behavior .",
    "this implies that the effective decay rate is reduced in the presence of strong measurements .",
    "(  maximum  superradiance , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath81 @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "right inset : the case of no superradiance . left inset : expectation value of the excited states @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a function of @xmath79 ]    to investigate thoroughly the underlying physics , we plot the expectation value of the excited states @xmath88 and @xmath91 as a function of @xmath21 in the left inset of fig .",
    "one clearly finds the occupation probabilities grow with increasing @xmath21 , and both of them approaches the value of @xmath92 .",
    "this not only means the measurements tend to localize the exciton in its excited state @xcite , but also tells us the entanglement is destroyed under the strong measurements .",
    "however , in the limit of no subradiance ( @xmath93 ) , the occupation probability of the singlet state is always equal to one , i.e. maximum entanglement is robust against strong measurements .",
    "this is because once the maximum entangled state is formed , the total probability in the excited states is also maximum .",
    "strong measurements on the ground state @xmath94 have no influence on the singlet entangled state .",
    "a few remarks about experimental realizations of the present model should be mentioned here .",
    "one should note that biexciton and charged - exciton effects are not included in our present model .",
    "inclusion of these additional states is expected to suppress the enhancement of the shot noise , i.e. degrees of entanglement .",
    "however , this can be controlled well by limiting the value of bias voltage so that only the ground - state exciton is present @xcite . to produce the maximum entangled state",
    ", one can also incorporate the device inside a microcavity @xcite .",
    "there are two advantages of this design : the maximum entanglement can be generated even for remote separation of the two dots , and forster process @xcite is avoided at this distance .",
    "as for the problem of decoherence due to interactions with phonons , recent experimental data have shown that the exciton - phonon dephasing rate is smaller than the radiative decay one in a quantum dot .",
    "this means that due to the discrete energy level scheme in a quantum dot , the effect of _ phonon - bottleneck _ tends to suppress the exciton - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "although the present model describes tunneling of electrons and holes into semiconductor quantum dots , the whole theory can be applied to electron tunneling through coupled quantum dots which are interacting via a common phonon environment @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the shot noise of superradiant entangled excitons is enhanced by a factor of two as compared to the poissonian value .",
    "this enhancement was attributed to exciton entanglement , induced by the electromagnetic field ( common photon reservoir ) , and an analogy to the cooper pair box was made .",
    "second , we found the relaxation behavior of the qubits in the presence of strong measurements , and the zeno - like effect tends to destroy the entanglement and localize the qubits in the excited states .",
