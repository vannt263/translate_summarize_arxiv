    "the two dimensional @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model is a asymptotically free field theory @xcite .",
    "it deserves special interest in view of asymptotically free four dimensional nonabelian gauge theories describing the strong interactions inbetween quarks .",
    "a fundamental feature of these theories is the existence of a nonvanishing mass - gap @xmath9 .",
    "recently the mass - gap of the sigma model has been calculated analytically on the basis of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "choosing the simplest regulator , namely a two dimensional hypercubic lattice with lattice spacing @xmath10 , and the standard nearest neighbor action functional with nearest neighbor coupling @xmath2 we consider @xmath11 where the fields @xmath12 are @xmath13-component unit vectors and the sum @xmath14 runs over the nearest neighbors on the lattice .",
    "the mass - gap correlation length @xmath15 has the value @xmath16 corresponding to the exact mass gap @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 denoting the 3-loop lattice cut - off parameter @xcite .",
    "the past numerical studies of the path integral @xcite consistently overestimated this number .",
    "these studies considered infinite volume mass - gap correlation length values @xmath19 up to about hundred lattice spacings @xmath10 with the help of cluster algorithms .",
    "it was also attempted to enlarge the accessible correlation length region utilizing real space renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "it was found , that asymptotic perturbative scaling only sets in at mass - gap correlation length values , which can hardly be fitted into the memory of todays computers .",
    "in addition it may also be appropriate to mention the still standing criticism of patrascioiu , seiler and others on the continuum limit of the sigma model @xcite .",
    "these authors argue in favor of a the existence of a phase with vanishing mass - gap in the sigma model , which is however not supported by the numerical data @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a challenge to confront the known analytical result on the mass - gap with the precision numerical simulations of the path integral .",
    "from such a study we might also gain better insight on how to accurately determine the mass - gap of lattice qcd .",
    "finite size scaling theory @xcite has been very successful throughout the years in predicting the behavior of the infinite volume correlation length of spin systems at criticality from the properties of finite systems , which in this paper are taken to be square boxes with linear extent @xmath20 and periodic boundary conditions . in a situation where the control parameter @xmath21 is large and , even at the critical point , where the correlation length is infinite , the path integrals singular part of the free energy on finite volume systems is a function of the control parameter @xmath22 alone . the fisher scaling analysis leads to reliable determinations of the correlation length divergence critical exponent @xmath23 in statistical mechanics models .",
    "in this paper we attempt a generalization of this idea to the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "its asymptotic freedom fixed point is located at infinite value of the bare nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the quantity under consideration is a free energy difference of twisted relative to untwisted spin configurations - the spin stiffness - forming a bloch wall , whose finite size scaling behavior is dominated by logarithmic terms in the control parameter @xmath24 in accord with the perturbative treatment of the path integral in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 hereby denotes the stiffness correlation length .",
    "we will argue , that a precise extraction of the @xmath25-shift corresponding to the stiffness correlation length is feasible up to @xmath2-values as large as @xmath4 , upon reasonable assumptions on the coefficients of the finite size scaling law .",
    "the integration of the shift in junction with a start value for the mass - gap correlation length @xmath19 allows the determination of the mass - gap @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 is devoted to the theoretical background and introduces the constraint effective potential , the considered free energy difference and discusses the finite size scaling hypothesis .",
    "section 3 contains details of the multicanonical ensemble simulation . in section 4",
    "we present our numerical analysis and results .",
    "section 5 concludes the of the paper .",
    "in statistical field theories , which share the universality class of continuous ferromagnets , it is well known on the basis of the @xmath26-expansion and the renormalization group @xcite , that the critical behavior of the system can be studied in the symmetry broken phase of the theory by considering path integrals of configurations , which interpolate inbetween regions of different order parameter orientation .",
    "the helicity modulus @xmath27 carries the information on the nonanalytical behavior in the symmetry broken phase of the theory .",
    "it is common to define the helicity modulus by the response of the system with respect to a twist angle @xmath28 , which is applied microscopically to the fields on the boundary of the lattice in one of the lattice directions .",
    "denoting @xmath29 the free energy , the free energy difference @xmath30 then defines the helicity modulus @xcite @xmath31 which is finite in the thermodynamic limit and allows for a geometry independent i.e. , @xmath28-independent , characterization of the bloch wall .",
    "hereby denotes @xmath32 the cross section orthogonal to the direction of the twist .",
    "e. g. , on a hypercubic lattices with linear extent @xmath20 one has @xmath33 and one expects @xmath34 .",
    "the critical behavior of the theory in terms of the helicity modulus is expressed by josephsons scaling law @xcite : @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear , that the presented scaling laws refer to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "in fact , when the dimension @xmath0 is approached from above for field theories with continuous symmetry , like the @xmath37 nonlinear sigma model with @xmath38 , symmetric xy model . ] the ferromagnetic character of the theory is lost and the helicity modulus @xmath27 according to eq.([helicity_modulos ] ) vanishes for any value of the bare coupling @xmath2 . in dimension",
    "@xmath0 the infinite volume system exhibits domains of different order parameter orientations , which are free to fluctuate .",
    "this is the content of the mermin wagner theorem .    at the heart of the problem",
    "is a study of the correspondingly defined free energy difference @xmath39 on finite lattices in the @xmath0 @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model at large values of the nearest neighbor coupling i.e. , in a situation in which the mass - gap correlation length @xmath19 exceeds the linear extent @xmath20 of the symmetric hypercubic lattice . in this situation one",
    "expects @xmath39 to be controlled by @xmath24 , where @xmath6 denotes the stiffness correlation length . based on the renormalization group , the @xmath40-expansion and the 1-loop approximation",
    ", the calculation has been performed for the case of a continuum square box with fixed twisted boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we quote the result @xmath41 + r(\\theta ) + { \\cal o(1)}. \\label{zinn_formula}\\ ] ] a few remarks are in order :    \\1 ) according to the expected fisher scaling @xmath39 splits into a singular part , which is a function of @xmath42 alone and a regular contribution @xmath43 .",
    "the stiffness correlation length @xmath6 follows the perturbative renormalization group , and thus in the large @xmath2-limit has the form @xmath44 however , @xmath6 is not identical to the mass - gap correlation length @xmath19 as is the control parameter @xmath45 as compared to @xmath22 .",
    "the stiffness correlation length @xmath6 describes the crossover of the system from its small volume behavior at large values of @xmath45 into a state of various domains of order parameter orientation on large volumes .",
    "it is expected to be larger than the mass - gap correlation length @xmath19 .",
    "recently billoire performed a high statistics numerical calculation of the stiffness correlation length @xcite at @xmath2-values far in the perturbative region @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively . expressing the measurement in units of the exact mass - gap correlation length we quote @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath6 takes its perturbative value that at a @xmath2-value of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition we expect a region of @xmath2-values , where @xmath6 as well as @xmath19 are governed by the same beta - shift @xmath25 .",

    "precision numerical simulations of the spin stiffness @xcite confirm this theoretical expectation . in the context of the present paper",

    "\\3 ) upon insertion of eq.([asymptotic_scaling ] ) into eq.([zinn_formula ] ) we observe , that the leading term in @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "this is the classical action difference of a twisted configuration at twist angle @xmath28 relative to a configuration with twist angle @xmath54 .",
    "the dominant effects of quantum fluctuations at fixed @xmath2 are linear in @xmath61 and are given by a term @xmath62 .",
    "they drive the spin stiffness to smaller values on the larger system sizes , as expected .",
    "\\4 ) the regular contribution @xmath43 in eq.([zinn_formula ] ) can be calculated in the small @xmath28 expansion .",
    "for the boundary conditions considered in @xcite one finds @xcite @xmath63",
    "i.e. , a negative contribution at finite @xmath28 values .",
    "we note that these contributions are nonuniversal in character and depend on the details of the implementation of the twist .",
    "numerical simulations of free energies are computationally difficult . in the standard approach one",
    "integrates the expectation value of the action difference of systems with nonzero twist @xmath28 and twist @xmath54 along the nearest neighbor coupling parameter direction @xmath2 .",
    "one can avoid the integration of the action by differentiating the path integral with respect to @xmath28 at a value of @xmath54 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the constraint effective potential ( cep ) @xcite of the mean field of the theory .",
    "the consideration of the cep is motivated by the analogous problem arising in the interfacial case in @xmath64 symmetric theories and recently numerical simulations of it have been conducted with the help of multicanonical ensemble simulations @xcite .",
    "one considers the mean field @xmath65 of the ising fields .",
    "its probability distribution @xmath66 contains at the same time the information concerning bulk as well as interfacial properties of the system .",
    "relevant for interfacial effects are states at @xmath67 on finite boxes with periodic boundary conditions",
    ". in this region of the phase space configurations contain two domains of opposite order parameter orientation and two interfaces are formed .",
    "widoms scaling law can be analyzed @xcite .",
    "lee and kosterlitz have performed a finite size scaling analysis of the cep at criticality @xcite leading to a determination of @xmath23 .    in case of the theory with continuous @xmath1 symmetry",
    "we introduce the @xmath13-component field @xmath68 and its absolute value , denoted the mean field @xmath69 in the following @xmath70 which will have the probability distribution @xmath71 in the canonical ensemble of the theory .",
    "the function @xmath72 is the cep of the theory .",
    "it can be obtained by rewriting the partition function @xmath73 into @xmath74 which can be achieved by introducing suitable @xmath75-functions and integration upon the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that @xmath76 is defined up to constant , which can easily be absorbed into a multiplicative normalization of @xmath77 .",
    "in addition a factor @xmath78 at @xmath79 appears in the path integral definition of @xmath80 .",
    "this factor is proportional to the surface of a @xmath81-sphere of radius @xmath82 and accounts for the degeneracy of states with respect to @xmath37 rotations . without taking this phase factor properly into account",
    "the cep is a singular function at @xmath83 .",
    "the cep attracted in the past attention in the context of the higgs - models represented by @xmath37 symmetric theories in @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "there it was studied with analytic methods @xcite as well with numerical simulations @xcite . in these models",
    "the cep has at a finite value @xmath86 a minimum , which corresponds to the higgs field expectation value .",
    "we may note , that both analytic , as well as the numerical considerations in these models were concerned with the shape of the cep in the vicinity of its minimum .    in the context of the present paper we are however concerned with the cep at values of the mean field @xmath82 equal to @xmath83 .",
    "we argue that states at @xmath83 correspond on hypercubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions to bloch walls carrying formally a twist angle of @xmath87 .",
    "this can be easily seen on the classical level by noting , that the field configuration @xmath88 minimizes the action functional for the given periodic boundary conditions at @xmath83 .",
    "this configuration exhibits on the scale of one lattice spacing @xmath10 spin twists of value @xmath89 in the 1-direction of the lattice , which upon integration in the 1-direction adds up to a total twist angle of @xmath87 .",
    "we expect this configuration and the added quantum fluctuations to dominate the @xmath83 state .",
    "thus in the framework of the cep it is strongly suggested , that the singular part of @xmath90 exhibits the same finite size scaling as the constraint effective potential difference , or potential barrier @xmath91 up to regular terms @xmath92 , provided the cep exhibits a maximum and minimum corresponding to the twisted and untwisted states .",
    "it is this finite size scaling hypothesis , which we will examine in the subsequent analysis of this paper .",
    "we will find , that the numerical evaluation of the cep confirms the hypothesis .",
    "by the use of standard monte carlo algorithms it would be very difficult to sample values of @xmath82 close to zero , if the value of the nearest neighbor coupling @xmath2 is larger than about @xmath93 on lattices of reasonable linear size @xmath20 . to overcome this difficulty , we modify the importance sampling by introducing a multicanonical - weight factor into the monte carlo sampling process @xcite .",
    "we remark , that the idea of multicanonical ensemble simulations consists in modifying the boltzmann - weight for the purpose of the improvement of the actual monte carlo sampling process .",
    "the modification is however done in such a way , that the effect of the multicanonical - weight will be removed in a well controlled way .",
    "thus in the end the cep can be determined in the canonical ensemble of the theory .    in case of the cep the multicanonical - weight factor",
    "is chosen to be a function of the mean field @xmath82 evaluated on each single configuration and will be denoted @xmath94 .",
    "it is in principal defined on the real interval @xmath95 $ ] and it is sensible to split the multicanonical - weight into a part , which takes care of the degeneracy with respect to @xmath1 rotations , and a yet unknown contribution @xmath96 .",
    "thus for the purpose of the monte carlo simulation we consider the multicanonical - weight @xmath97 and @xmath98 to be the boltzmann - factor , which generates the markov process . in order to obtain a representation of the multicanonical - weight @xmath99 , which in a computer is easily calculable , we choose @xmath100 to be a polygon , which on a finite set of @xmath101 intervals @xmath102 for each interval is characterized by two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 :",
    "@xmath105 one may view the parameters @xmath104 as magnetic sources , which are applied on piecewise intervals of the operator @xmath82 to the theory .",
    "in one of our earlier publications we therefore named the resulting ensemble the multimagnetical ensemble @xcite .",
    "we found it sufficient in the actual numerical simulations , to first determine a value @xmath106 in a standard simulation .",
    "in this situation @xmath106 is calculated in such a way , that all the relevant structure of the cep , namely the location of its minimum , and the states at @xmath83 are included in the considered @xmath82-interval .",
    "it means that we will only evaluate the shape of the cep for values @xmath107 .",
    "we then choose for reasons of simplicity an aequidistant partition of the considered @xmath82-interval into @xmath108 or @xmath109 different intervals @xmath110 , which in the actual simulations turned out to be a sufficiently fine polygon approximation to the multicanonical - weight @xmath99 .",
    "multicanonical ensemble simulations are defined by the requirement , that the considered operator exhibits an almost constant , ideally a constant , probability distribution in the simulation .",
    "if in the canonical ensemble the density of states function with mean field @xmath82 is denoted @xmath111 , then the ideal multicanonical - weight factor is @xmath112 though trivial , we note , that a priori the multicanonical - weight is not known .",
    "less trivial we remark , that it is possible to obtain an estimate of the weight factor from the monte carlo simulation . in the vicinity of a given value of the operator @xmath82",
    "one may sample the phase space in an attempt to estimate the density of states .",
    "in practice we perform for each of the considered intervals @xmath110 a separate simulation with @xmath82-values constrained to the given interval . in the simulation",
    "each parameter @xmath104 is then determined under the requirement that the probability distribution of the mean field @xmath82 approximates the multicanonical distribution at its best .",
    "the full set of all parameters @xmath104 serves the purpose of the construction of the complete multicanonical - weight according to eq.([the_weights_1 ] ) and eq.([the_weights_2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , for given @xmath104 the parameters @xmath103 can be chosen in such a way , that the resulting polygon is a steady function of @xmath82 .",
    "we note , that one parameter value , e.g. @xmath113 is left undetermined by this procedure .",
    "this again corresponds to the overall normalization freedom of the path integral . in our actual simulations",
    "we have found , that this simple and robust procedure results into acceptable multicanonical - weights and distribution functions .    once the multicanonical - weight factor has been determined , we implement one sweep of the monte carlo sampling by a combination of a swendsen - wang reflection cluster update @xcite , followed by a subsequent accept - reject decision , which then depends on @xmath114 alone .",
    "it means , that we define the cluster degrees of freedom from the cinetic term of the action , and , that we replace the usual equal probability rule of the cluster update , by a @xmath115-hit metropolis accept - reject decision in all the cluster degrees of freedom , depending on the magnetic properties of the system . at this value for the number of hits we obtained average acceptance rates for moves of the system at about one half for",
    "almost all the considered @xmath2 and @xmath20 values . in order to monitor the performance of this update procedure , we divided the considered @xmath82-interval into an arbitrarily chosen @xmath116 , but equally spaced bins .",
    "we measure the average flip - autocorrelation time @xmath117 for a transition of the system from the first to the eights bin , or vice versa .",
    "while due to the partitioning some arbitrariness in the definition of @xmath118 is induced , we nevertheless expect , that it will exhibit the basic aspects of the monte carlo time dynamics .",
    "1 ) contains data for the quantity @xmath117 obtained on a @xmath119 lattice for @xmath2-values in between @xmath93 and @xmath120 ( circles ) , and for a fixed @xmath2-value @xmath121 on lattice sizes ranging in between @xmath122 to @xmath123 ( triangles ) .",
    "one notices a typical time scale of several thousand sweeps , which in general is characteristic for our simulation . in detail",
    "we observe , that at a given @xmath2-value the flip - autocorrelation time stays almost constant , or even decreases with increasing lattice sizes .",
    "we attribute this favorable property to the nonlocal nature the algorithm .",
    "we also observe on the given lattice a rapid increase of the flip - autocorrelation time with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "such an increase is expected , as the simulational complexity of the theory will rise in the proximity of the asymptotic freedom fixed point .    in the multicanonical simulation",
    "we measure the multicanonical probability distribution @xmath124 of the mean field @xmath82 .",
    "it is related to the probability distribution in the canonical ensemble @xmath125 by a simple reweighing step @xmath126 and thus with the help of eq.([p_can ] ) the cep can be determined in the multicanonical simulations . throughout our simulations",
    "we have fixed the minimum value of the cep to be zero .",
    "in addition we perform a bias corrected jackknife error analysis for all the measured quantities .",

    "we study small systems of sizes ranging in between @xmath134 up to @xmath135 . for @xmath2-values larger than @xmath136",
    "the mass - gap correlation length @xmath19 is comparable with the considered lattice sizes .",
    "accordingly it is expected that the stiffness correlation length @xmath6 exceeds the linear size of the systems and the onset fisher scaling may be expected . in a first set of simulations",
    "we have studied the @xmath20-dependence of the cep at twelve values of the nearest neighbor coupling , namely at the @xmath2-values @xmath137 and at the @xmath2-values @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in a second set of simulations",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the cep potential was determined on a @xmath119 lattice at @xmath2-values ranging inbetween @xmath140 up to @xmath141 .",
    "in total we have accumulated @xmath142 pairs of couplings @xmath2 and lattice sizes @xmath20 within our simulation .",
    "it is important to check our basic assumption , that states at mean field @xmath83 carry a twist angle of @xmath87 . for this purpose",

    "we apply in a first step a global rotation which equals the arbitrarily chosen @xmath13 component of the field @xmath143 to zero .",
    "we then map the @xmath127 and @xmath52 components of the fields along paths in the lattice onto the complex plane . in this mapping",
    "we connect fields , which are neighbors within the path , by a line .",

    "the considered lattice size is @xmath119 and the nearest neighbor coupling is @xmath144 , far in the perturbative region .",
    "the value of @xmath82 for the considered configuration was @xmath145 , which is very close to zero .",
    "one clearly observes the winding angle of @xmath146 for the latter case i.e. , for all paths on the main axis of the lattice in the 2-direction , which is clear evidence in favor of the above assumption .",
    "it is noteworthy to remark that fluctuations around the classical state eq.([the_classical_state ] ) are sizable even for such a large @xmath2-value .",
    "they increase as @xmath2 is lowered and decrease as @xmath2 is enlarged .",
    "in addition we also mention , that states at @xmath83 apparently break the cubic group lattice symmetry i.e. , in the here considered configuration the twist appears in the 2-direction of the lattice .",
    "we have checked , that statistical independent configurations at @xmath83 assume the possible different twist directions with equal probability . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it must be expected that this additional degree of freedom , as compared to a theory with a fixed direction of the twist , contributes to the unknown regular contributions of the finite size scaling relation eq.([hypothesis ] ) .    in fig .",

    "we observe a crossover from a situation , where for the smaller @xmath20-values the cep for states at @xmath83 exhibits a barrier @xmath149 , to a situation at the largest @xmath20-value , where the barrier vanishes .",
    "thus the decrease of the spin stiffness with increasing @xmath20 is observed .",
    "this is attributed to the quantum fluctuations around the classical state with twist angle @xmath87 .",
    "we may remark , that in simulations of ferromagnets , namely the @xmath84 @xmath1 sigma model in its symmetry broken phase , we have witnessed an increase of the potential barrier with increasing @xmath20 .    at @xmath121 the mass - gap correlation length and @xmath6 exceed the linear lattice size by a large factor . correspondingly a crossover can not be observed and @xmath150 is finite on the considered range of lattice sizes .",

    "analogous remarks as in the previous case on the fit - intervals and the @xmath159-values apply .",

    "we will assume here , that the possible form of the @xmath168-corrections is already determined on the classical level .",
    "correspondingly we assume in the fully fluctuating theory , that additional contributions can be accounted for by a nonunity value of the parameter @xmath166 .",
    "the potential barrier in the continuum @xmath169 is then related to @xmath151 evaluated on the lattice via the relation @xmath170 which then allows the comparison of the lattice data with the continuum scaling form .",

    "we leave the prefactor @xmath176 of the double logarithmic scaling term to be a free parameter .",
    "it may be tolerated , that some of the omitted @xmath177 higher order terms of the loop expansion in eq.([final_fit_formula ] ) may be represented effectively by a value of @xmath176 , which differs from @xmath175 .",
