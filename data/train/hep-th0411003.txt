    "the quantization of liouville field theory has been subject to intensive study .",
    "the hamiltonian quantization on a compact space , i.e. the circle , has been carried through in @xcite ; the main result is that provided one properly tunes the anomalous contribution to the energy momentum tensor , the regularized theory satisfies the virasoro algebra .    from the functional point of view in the euclidean formulation",
    "a major difficulty is that in absence of sources there is no stable background with sphere topology .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the pseudosphere topology @xcite where a stable background solution exists around which a perturbative expansion can be developed @xcite .",
    "divergences occur in the calculation of the graphs . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that provided one chooses a proper regularization of the green function at coincident points one reproduces the dimensions of the vertex operators and in particular of the cosmological term as derived in the hamiltonian approach in @xcite .    on the sphere ,",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that in order to have a stable background , sources have to be present , and such sources can not be arbitrarily small as they are subject to the picard inequalities .",
    "such inequalities in particular tell us that the sources must be at least three . on the other hand the classical solution in presence of three singularities",
    "is known in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a perturbation theory starting from the three point background such as to render the functional approach to liouville theory self consistent and completely independent of the hamiltonian approach . to such end",
    "it is necessary to compute the green function on the classical background of three generic charges .",
    "this is done in sect.3 where the problem of computing the semiclassical four point function with three finite charges plus a fourth infinitesimal is addressed .",
    "the result is obtained by solving perturbatively the riemann - hilbert problem , i.e. providing a perturbative calculation of the poincar accessory parameters which appears in the four singularity problem .",
    "the result is obtained in terms of quadratures and as a by product the exact green function on the sphere with three arbitrary singularities is obtained , provided such singularities satisfy the necessary picard bounds .",
    "several of the obtained results can be extended to the semiclassical @xmath2 point functions where @xmath0 charges are finite and the remaining @xmath1 small and this is done in sect.4 .    in order to produce the quantum correlation functions one has to proceed with the perturbative expansion where as in @xcite the expansion parameter is the liouville coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "the first problem is to compute the functional determinant of the linearized problem on the classical background .",
    "the problem is addressed in sect.6 .",
    "the most natural tool in defining the functional determinant is the well known zeta function regularization .",
    "however such regularization gives the cosmological term weights which are in contrast with those required by local conformal invariance with the result that only the global @xmath4 invariance survives .",
    "thus a different regularization is developed for computing such a determinant .",
    "the procedure , which is similar in spirit to the procedure of @xcite is to compute the variation of the determinant under small variation of the sources ; the advantage of such a procedure is to expose the role of the value of the green function at coincident points . if the green function at coincident points is regularized according the proposal of zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov in the context of the pseudosphere @xcite , one obtains dimensions for the vertex operators which agree with those found in the hamiltonian approach and in particular the cosmological term assumes weight @xmath5 .",
    "the next problem is to examine the higher order correction . in sect.7",
    "we perform a detailed computation of the two loop contributions and we find that using the same regularization such contributions do not alter the quantum anomalous dimensions found in the hamiltonian approach . in providing the necessary cancellations the boundary terms appearing in the action play a fundamental role .    in principle",
    "such computation can be carried on to arbitrary order perturbation theory and one could use it to furnish a perturbative analysis of the three - point vertex function conjectured in @xcite and derived in @xcite and of higher point functions",
    ". such investigation will be the subject of a future paper .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction such a regularization scheme gives the cosmological term the weights @xmath165 .",
    "in the following we shall pursue a different regularization scheme .    to compute the determinant ( [ determinant ] )",
    "we shall use a variational procedure similar to the one employed in the standard heat kernel approach @xcite , with the simplifying feature that we shall compute simply the derivative with respect to the three parameters @xmath166 .",
    "we have @xmath167 in the above equation the green function at coincident points appears and such a quantity has to be regularized .",
    "we have already seen that the invariant hadamard regularization gives rise to a theory in which the cosmological term @xmath168 does not have weights @xmath5 and as such does not give rise to a theory invariant under the whole ( infinite dimensional ) conformal group .",
    "we shall adopt here the regularization proposed by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov @xcite ( zz regulator ) for perturbative calculations on the pseudosphere i.e. @xmath169 as under an @xmath4 transformation @xmath170 the green function is invariant in value @xmath171 we have @xmath172 the above relation will play a major role in all subsequent developments .",
    "let us consider first the dilatation @xmath173 ; we have @xmath174 and thus using eq.([etaderivative ] ) keeping in mind that from eq.([area ] ) @xmath175 we have @xmath176 where we evidenced the dependence of the determinant on the position of the singularities .",
    "we remark that such a result is consistent with the known exact structure of the three - point function given by eq.([3pointsemiclassical ] ) with @xmath177 replaced by the quantum anomalous dimensions @xmath178 thus what is left is to extend the above argument to the general @xmath4 transformation and to prove that the subsequent perturbative corrections @xmath179 do not alter the @xmath180 dependence of the three - point function .",
    "we want to express @xmath181 in terms of @xmath182 the transformation which takes from @xmath132 to @xmath183 is given by @xmath184 and consequently @xmath185 and for the green function at coincident points @xmath186 we obtain @xmath187 being @xmath188 and @xmath189 the finite parts of the field @xmath190 at @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the last three terms are the result of performing the integral containing @xmath193 which can be computed by using the equation for the field @xmath190 .",
    "thus @xmath194 and similarly @xmath195 on the other hand for the derivative with respect to @xmath196 we find @xmath197 recalling now eqs.([xrelation],[classicalthreepoint ] ) we see that @xmath198}{\\partial \\eta_1\\partial   \\eta_3}\\ ] ] is independent of @xmath43 , and similarly for @xmath199 while we have @xmath200}{\\partial    \\eta_3 ^ 2}-4\\log\\left|\\frac{z_1-z_2}{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_3)}\\right|.\\ ] ] we must now take into account the additional boundary term contribution in the action ( [ quantumaction2 ] ) @xmath201 which has it origin in the fact that @xmath13 is not @xmath202 but @xmath203 .",
    "summing up we have for @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 @xmath207 integration of the above equation gives @xmath208 as @xmath150 correction i.e. the one loop correction , and we have obtained the three - point function with the correct quantum dimensions @xmath209 .",
    "thus the situation is very similar to what happens on the pseudosphere , where the one loop corrections with the zz regulator provide the exact quantum dimensions . on the pseudosphere is not too difficult to prove that higher loop corrections do not change the quantum anomalous dimensions of the vertex fields @xmath161 . on the sphere due to the appearance of the boundary terms",
    "the analysis is more complicated .",
    "we shall give here below the explicit calculation proving that at two loop no change is induced in the dimensions of the vertex fields .",
    "in this section we shall compute explicitly the two loop corrections to the three point function .",
    "the interaction vertices relevant to the two loop calculation are @xmath210 with @xmath152 .",
    "one should not forget the interaction originating from the boundary term in eq.([quantumaction2 ] ) with action given by @xmath211 the relevant graphs are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the explicit computation gives @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214 and @xmath215 with regard to contribution @xmath216 we notice it can be rewritten by performing the change of variable @xmath217 as follows @xmath218 we notice that the divergent part in @xmath219 is canceled by the term @xmath220 appearing to order @xmath221 in the expansion of @xmath222 and this assures the finiteness of the @xmath163 computation for @xmath223 .",
    "we have now to compute the change of the sum @xmath224 under an @xmath4 transformation . for doing that it is simpler to prove separately the invariance under translations , dilatations and inversions .",
    "the invariance under translations is trivial ; with regard to dilatations @xmath225 , @xmath226 goes over to @xmath227 while @xmath228 becomes @xmath229 using the relation @xmath230 we see that the variation of @xmath231 vanishes .",
    "similarly one finds using eq.([dequation ] ) that the variation of @xmath232 vanishes .",
    "we are left to prove the invariance under the inversion @xmath233 .",
    "the variation of @xmath226 is computed as usual by performing integrations by parts @xmath234 where the first and the fifth integral vanish in the @xmath235 limit due to the appearance of @xmath236 . on the other hand the variation of @xmath228",
    "is given by @xmath237 similarly one computes the variation of @xmath238 @xmath239 and the variation of @xmath216 @xmath240 performing integrations by parts in the third and fourth integrals appearing in eq.([avariation ] ) we find that the variation of @xmath224 under inversion vanishes and thus we have invariance under the whole @xmath4 group . in appendix b we give the details of the calculation .",
    "in this paper we have provided a functional approach to the quantum liouville theory on the sphere , which does not make any appeal to the canonical quantization .",
    "we start from the stable classical background solution in presence of three finite sources satisfying the picard bounds . we compute the semiclassical four point function with three finite sources and the fourth weak which as a by product furnishes in terms of quadratures the exact green function on the background generated by three finite sources .",
    "several of the results obtained for the four point functions extend to the case of the semiclassical vertex functions with @xmath0 finite charges and @xmath1 infinitesimal charges .",
    "the lowest order quantum correction is provided by the determinant of the linearized problem on the liouville three - source background .",
    "the regularization suggested by zamolodchikov and zamolodchikov in the context of the pseudosphere @xcite gives rise to the quantum dimensions found in the hamiltonian approach while the invariant ( hadamard ) regularization of the green function fails to give the cosmological term the weight @xmath5 .",
    "an explicit calculation shows that the two loop correction do not alter such dimensions .",
    "we expect such a result to hold to all order perturbation theory even if the presence of the contour terms , which are essential to obtain the two loop result , makes the calculation not so straightforward as in the case of the pseudosphere .",
    "the obtained results can be useful to perform a perturbative analysis of the three - point vertex function conjectured in @xcite and derived in @xcite and of higher point functions .",
    "one of us ( p.m. ) is grateful to domenico seminara for a useful discussion .",
    "we give here the calculations of the monodromy matrices around @xmath241 and the procedure to impose on all of them the @xmath39 nature .",
    "the behavior of the canonical unperturbed solutions around @xmath133 is @xmath242 and one can obtain the behavior of the integrals @xmath131 as follows @xmath243 @xmath244 @xmath245 and of the perturbed solutions @xmath246z^{\\frac{1-\\lambda_1}{2 } } - \\varepsilon\\ , \\frac{i_{11}(0)}{w_{12}}\\,z^{\\frac{1+\\lambda_1}{2 } } \\\\",
