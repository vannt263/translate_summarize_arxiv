    "one - dimensional systems with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom have been attracting a considerable attention during the last two years .",
    "this interest is partly motivated by the progress in the experimental study of the quasi - one - dimensional spin - gap materials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are believed to be described by a two - band orbitally degenerate hubbard model at quarter filling.@xcite orbital degrees of freedom may be described with the help of pseudospin-1/2 variables ; the corresponding effective hamiltonian for the two - band hubbard model was derived long ago by kugel and khomskii @xcite and has the following form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the spin-@xmath6 and pseudospin-@xmath6 operators at the site @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be viewed as two spin-@xmath6 chains coupled by a biquadratic interaction only ( a generalized spin ladder ) .",
    "generally , the model has an @xmath8 symmetry , so that the total spin @xmath9 of the @xmath10-chain , as well as the @xmath11-projection @xmath12 of the total spin of the @xmath13-chain are good quantum numbers . under certain simplifying assumptions (",
    "neglecting hund s rule coupling , nearest neighbor hopping between the same type of orbitals only , and only one coulomb on - site repulsion constant ) , one obtains the above hamiltonian with @xmath14 , @xmath15 which possesses the hidden su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "@xcite at this special point , the model is bethe ansatz solvable @xcite and gapless .",
    "depending on the microscopic details of the interaction , this high symmetry can be broken in several ways .",
    "for example , finite hund s rule coupling or existence of more than one coulomb repulsion constant makes @xmath16 and @xmath17 different , and local crystal fields can induce considerable anisotropy in the orbital sector .",
    "the phase diagram of the isotropic ( @xmath14 ) @xmath18 version of the model ( [ ham ] ) in the vicinity of the @xmath19 point was analytically studied recently by several authors .",
    "@xcite extensive density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies of the phase diagram @xcite established the form of phase boundaries and the quantum numbers of the lowest - lying excitations.@xcite    moving away off the @xmath19 point towards larger @xmath20 , @xmath21 , one runs into the spontaneously dimerized phase with a finite gap and twofold degenerate ground state .",
    "the structure of the elementary excitation spectrum in the dimerized phase is known rather incompletely .",
    "the weak coupling ( @xmath22 ) region of the dimerized phase is known to be a realization of the so - called non - haldane spin liquid @xcite where magnons become incoherent excitations since they are unstable against the decay into soliton - antisoliton pairs .",
    "variational study for a special `` dimer point '' @xmath23 , where the exact ground state in a form of a simple valence bond solid state is known , @xcite confirms that solitons are the lowest excited states also in case of strong coupling .",
    "however , recent dmrg results @xcite revealed a complicated pattern of the change in quantum numbers of the lowest - lying excited states in the vicinity of this special point ; the standard dmrg technique provides only the information about the quantum numbers and energy of the lowest excited state , but not the information on the entire spectrum .",
    "recent work @xcite using the so - called dynamical dmrg method contains data for the dynamical structure factor , but for only one point in the dimerized phase , namely for the dimer point .",
    "further , realistic material - relevant models are generically anisotropic ( @xmath24 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath25 ) ; @xcite the anisotropic model of the same type arises also as an effective hamiltonian for a spin tube.@xcite thus we think it is of interest to get insight into the properties of the elementary excitations in the dimerized phase of the more general asymmetric / anisotropic model , which is the aim of the present paper .",
    "in section [ sec : exact ] we introduce briefly the `` dimer line '' in the space of model parameters where the exact twofold degenerate spontaneously dimerized ground state is known . based on this picture of the ground state , in section [ sec : ee ]",
    "we present the variational study of the interplay between different types of elementary excitations , namely , between soliton - antisoliton pairs and their bound states ( magnons ) .",
    "we show that soliton pairs are the lowest excitations only in a narrow region of the phase diagram , and away from the dimer line the low - energy physics is determined by magnon - type localized excitations which are essentially soliton - antisoliton bound states .",
    "an additional phase boundary is shown to appear when the anisotropy exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "variational dispersion curves are found to agree qualitatively with the exact diagonalization ( lanczos ) results in the vicinity of the dimer line .    in section",
    "[ sec : holes ] we describe some exact results for the doped spin - orbital model on the `` dimer line '' .",
    "we show that the natural charge excitation in this case is a `` charged soliton '' , i.e. , the bound state of a hole and a soliton in the dimer order .",
    "it is found that under certain condition `` charged solitons '' themselves exhibit a tendency to form bound states ; exact expressions for the energy of those bound states are presented .",
    "in addition to the @xmath19 model , there are several other particular points in the phase diagram of ( [ ham ] ) , for which exact results are available.@xcite particularly , at the point @xmath26 the exact ground state @xcite is a product of checkerboard - ordered spin and orbital singlets ( see fig.[fig : ee ] ) , so that the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are completely decoupled in the ground state .",
    "this ground state is spontaneously dimerized and thus twofold degenerate in case of periodic boundary conditions ( for open boundaries the degeneracy would be 8-fold ) .",
    "one can show @xcite that the same ground state persists in a finite range of anisotropy in the case of the special choice @xmath27 . in this case , up to a constant term , the model ( [ ham ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath28 where we have set @xmath29 to be the unit energy scale .",
    "then it is easy to see that the choice @xmath30 , @xmath31 makes the checkerboard - type singlet product wave function an eigenstate , and one can prove that it stays the ground state as long as @xmath32 .",
    "thus , in the 3d phase space @xmath33 one has a line with an exactly known ground state ; in what follows we will call it the `` dimer line '' for the sake of brevity .",
    "this line ends at the multicritical point @xmath34 , where the ground state becomes degenerate with infinitely many other states : e.g. , changing any of the orbital ( @xmath35 ) singlets into a triplet with @xmath36 does not change the energy .",
    "the point @xmath37 is another multicritical point where the triplets with @xmath38 can be created with no energy cost .",
    "for @xmath39 the ground state is also exactly known @xcite and is a product of the ferromagnetic state in @xmath40-sector and the antiferromagnetic bethe - ansatz state in the @xmath41-sector .",
    "the energy of ferromagnons softens at @xmath42 when @xmath43 tends to @xmath44 .",
    "we have also checked that ( [ ham1 ] ) at @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the only nontrivial model with exactly known ground state ( within the physically relevant subspace of hamiltonians defined by ( [ ham ] ) ) which can be found within the matrix - product based optimum ground states approach ( see e.g. ref . and references therein ) , at least if one uses a rather general matrix - product ansatz @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the elementary matrix @xmath47 has the following form : @xmath48 here @xmath7 denotes the rung of the `` ladder , '' and the first and second arrows denote the states of @xmath41 and @xmath40 spins , respectively .",
    "in the vicinity of the dimer line , the elementary excitations can be studied variationally .",
    "there are essentially two types of excitations : ( i ) solitons connecting the two degenerate spontaneously dimerized ground states ( exactly speaking , soliton pairs ) , and ( ii ) magnons which are localized excitations and can be viewed as soliton - antisoliton bound states .",
    "the variational results give an upper bound for the dispersion at the dimer line where the ground state is exact , and one may expect that they provide a reasonably good approximation in the vicinity of this line .      for a single soliton excitations one can use the variational ansatz of the type introduced in ref .",
    ": @xmath49 here the states @xmath50 , @xmath51 are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the effective `` center of mass '' coordinates of @xmath54 and @xmath55 states , respectively , and @xmath56 is a variational parameter .",
    "this soliton state has the quantum numbers @xmath57 , @xmath58 and may be combined in pair with the corresponding antisoliton state to get states with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 . since there are no diagonal exchange interactions in our `` ladder '' , the variational energy of a single soliton does not depend on @xmath63 so that we omit the corresponding index in what follows .",
    "it is easy to see that there exist a couple of useful symmetry properties . upon the operation of interchanging upper and lower leg @xmath64 the @xmath65 and @xmath66 soliton states transform as @xmath67 , @xmath68 ,",
    "so that @xmath69 ) calculated with the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) has a minimum at a certain @xmath70 , then the energy of the same state calculated with the hamiltonian with interchanged @xmath71 and @xmath72 operators should have a minimum at @xmath73 .",
    "an important consequence is that in the symmetric case @xmath74 , @xmath75 the minimum should always occur at @xmath76 .",
    "( it should be remarked that this property was missed in our earlier treatment;@xcite the variational parameter @xmath77 used in ref .",
    "was erroneously assumed to be real , which forced the minimum to be at @xmath78 ) .    upon a reflection @xmath79 the soliton states transform as @xmath80 , latexmath:[$|r\\rangle_{n}\\mapsto    \\label{symp }      & = & \\alpha e^{ip(2n+1 ) }    denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the energies of two states with mutually conjugate wave functions should be equal , therefore replacing @xmath56 by @xmath82 should not change the variational energy , which means that the minimum is reached on a subspace with @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we can set @xmath84 in our variational ansatz ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "essentially simple but tedious calculation of the variational dispersion yields @xmath85 where we have used the notation @xmath86(383 - 392\\cos(2p))\\nonumber\\\\          & + & ( \\varepsilon+3)(48\\cos(4p)+180\\cos(2p)-93),\\nonumber\\\\ f_{c}(p)&=&4\\cos p ( 33 - 32\\cos2p ) \\ { ( 2j_{\\tau}-3)(\\varepsilon+3)+6j_{s}\\},\\nonumber\\\\ f_{s}(p)&=&20\\sin p",

    "the equation @xmath88 always has two roots , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and one of them yields the minimum for @xmath91 , and the other does so for @xmath92 . in this way , though one can not see that from eq .",
    "( [ esol ] ) directly , the final minimized soliton energy @xmath93 is symmetric with respect to the shift @xmath94 , in full agreement with the fact that the brillouin zone in the dimerized phase is halved .    for certain special cases",
    "the variational soliton dispersion can be sufficiently simplified .",
    "it is easy to see that under the following condition of _ `` generalized symmetry '' : _",
    "@xmath95 the function @xmath96 identically vanishes , so that the minimum of ( [ esol ] ) is reached at @xmath97 or @xmath98 ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , and one obtains @xmath99 at the dimer line , i.e. , for @xmath100 , the above expression simplifies further to @xmath101 the energy gap at the dimer line occurs always at @xmath102 , @xmath98 .",
    "one can check that the gap which follows from ( [ edimer ] ) coincides with the result given in ref .  ; however , for general @xmath103 the formula ( [ edimer ] ) yields the lower energy and is in addition much simpler than the corresponding expression in ref ..    the energy of the continuum of soliton - antisoliton scattering states is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are respectively the total and relative momentum .",
    "all momenta here are defined for the original non - dimerized chain , and the brillouin zone is in fact halved , so that @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "we understand `` magnons '' as localized excitations which do not break the dimer order ( in contrast to solitons ) . in a crude approximation",
    ", one could imagine that a magnon state corresponds to exciting one of the singlet bonds on the @xmath71 or @xmath72 chains to a triplet and making it propagate along the chain .",
    "one may speak about @xmath71- or @xmath72-magnons , respectively . in",
    "turns out , however , that such a crude single - mode approximation overestimates considerably the magnon energy .",
    "a simple reason is that a state @xmath108 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnon ] is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian even at the dimer line , and under the action of the hamiltonian it gets mixed with other states . in the vicinity of the dimer line",
    "the largest contribution to the first - order matrix elements ( i.e. , of the @xmath109 type ) comes from the action of the local hamiltonian @xmath110 coupling the sites @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : magnon ] ) .",
    "the other first - order contributions are proportional to small parameters @xmath113 , @xmath114 , measuring the deviations from the dimer line , and we neglect them for the sake of consistency ( see below ) .",
    "thus , it looks reasonable to take a linear combination of the two orthogonal states @xmath108 and @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnon ] ) as a simplest variational ansatz .",
    "the magnon state with momentum @xmath105 can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is assumed to be normalized , and @xmath118 is a variational parameter .",
    "after minimization in @xmath118 , the magnon dispersions take the following form : @xmath119 where the superscripts for @xmath72-magnons indicate the value of @xmath12 .",
    "one may observe that the inclusion of the above - mentioned contributions to @xmath117 which are proportional to @xmath120 , @xmath121 would lead to corrections of the order @xmath122 in both the bandwidth and the self - energy of magnons . to be consistent",
    ", we have to omit those contributions , since we have already implicitly neglected the corrections to the ground state energy which are also @xmath122 in the leading order .",
    "( this does _ not _ mean , of course , that our calculation will have the accuracy @xmath122 , since the contributions from the higher - order matrix elements of the type @xmath123 do not contain any small parameter .",
    "the ansatz ( [ mag - ansatz ] ) should be considered as purely variational , sort of `` one - step lanczos '' trick ) .",
    "the self - energies for @xmath72-magnons can be compactly written as @xmath124 where @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "the expression for the self - energy of an @xmath71-magnon is somewhat cumbersome due to the fact that the state @xmath117 in case of the @xmath71-magnons does not have a certain value of the total orbital momentum @xmath129 and is a mixture of states with @xmath130 and @xmath131 : @xmath132 \\nonumber\\\\   & + & 8j_{\\tau}\\varepsilon^{2 } ( \\varepsilon^{4}+6\\varepsilon^{3}+21\\varepsilon^{2}+32\\varepsilon+24 ) \\nonumber\\\\    & + & \\varepsilon^{6}+6\\varepsilon^{5}+21\\varepsilon^{4}+44\\varepsilon^{3 }   + 36(2\\varepsilon^{2}+2\\varepsilon+1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can observe that the ansatz for a magnon state which we have used above is in fact equivalent to the simplest possible ansatz for a bound state of soliton and antisoliton , where only the configurations of the type latexmath:[\\[|l\\rangle_n|\\bar l\\rangle_{n+{1\\over2}},\\quad       \\quad |l\\rangle_n |\\bar r\\rangle_{n+{1\\over2}},\\quad     being nearest neighbors are taken into account . here",
    "the bars denote antisoliton states ; note that for fixed boundary conditions , solitons and antisolitons live on different sublattices , e.g. the free spin in the @xmath13 chain ( see fig.[fig : ee ] ) is placed on the odd ( even ) rung for solitons ( antisolitons ) , respectively , which is reflected in the above notation .",
    "this indicates that magnons should be viewed as bound soliton - antisoliton states , rather than as independent excitations .",
    "our simple ansatz can capture only the short - range physics of the tightly bound states with quantum numbers @xmath134 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 ; it will miss , however , possibly existing higher - lying loosely bound states as well as states with @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that solitons themselves can be viewed as bound states of two spinons belonging to the @xmath71 and @xmath72 chains , respectively , which should unbind when one moves towards the exactly solvable @xmath19 point .",
    "therefore on the way from the @xmath19 point to the dimer line there should exist an interesting hierarchy of bound states , which would be an interesting subject of the future studies .",
    "the minimum of the lower boundary of the soliton continuum is at @xmath135 in the immediate vicinity of the dimer line . when @xmath16 , @xmath17 decrease below certain values , the second equivalent minimum splits off and starts to move towards @xmath136 .",

    "one can see that whenever the variational gap closes while moving from the dimer line , the magnon gap touches zero first , so that the phase transitions are always governed by magnons .",
    "three branches of @xmath72-magnons are degenerate at @xmath74 , and for @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) the @xmath142-magnons ( @xmath140-magnons ) become lower in energy , respectively ; the @xmath71-branch lies always in between the @xmath140 and @xmath142 branches . in this connection , we would like to make a remark concerning fig .  4 of ref .   which shows the behavior of the @xmath71-magnon gap ( the lowest excitation in the @xmath148 sector ) across one of the phase boundaries in the model ( [ ham1 ] ) with @xmath149 .",
    "we think the behavior of @xmath71-gap is not relevant as a proof of the first order transition , because another excitation , namely that of the @xmath150 sector , should be responsible for the transition .",
    "away from the dimer line our description should become progressively worse since the pure dimer state is too far from the correct ground state .",
    "thus the present approach can not be used for estimation of the shape of the phase boundaries , except when they become close to the dimer line ( see below ) .",
    "another observation is that though the gap of the soliton continuum can be at incommensurate @xmath105 , the lowest excited state almost always ( actually except for very narrow regions , whose existence may well be an artifact of our approximation ) occurs at the commensurate values of @xmath135 or @xmath136 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ) , which is consistent with the results of refs .  .",
    "however , the contribution from solitons can be observed in the _ dynamic _ structure factor @xmath151 .",
    "unfortunately , the only existing dynamical dmrg study @xcite provides data only for one point in the dimerized phase ( namely , for the point @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath74 ) where no incommensurability is expected .",
    "one can see that if @xmath43 tends towards the multicritical points @xmath34 or @xmath37 , then there are _ two _ transitions along the generalized symmetry line in the vicinity of the point @xmath100 belonging to the dimer line : one at @xmath154 , and another at @xmath155 .",
    "this indicates that if the anisotropy exceeds a certain critical value , an additional transition boundary should appear in the ( @xmath17 , @xmath16 ) plane .",
    "note that in this case the variational phase boundaries lie close to the dimer line , so that this statement can be considered reliable .",
    "we have studied the spectrum of low - lying excitations of the model ( [ ham1 ] ) by means of the exact diagonalization ( lanczos ) method , using a chain consisting of 12 sites ( i.e. having 12 spin and 12 pseudospin degrees of freedom ) .",

    "identification of different types of excitations can be done as follows : free soliton - antisoliton pairs can have any of the four above - mentioned @xmath158 combinations , whose energy would be exactly degenerate in the infinite system ; that allows one to identify the soliton states in fig .",

    "<S> we study , both numerically and variationally , the interplay between different types of elementary excitations in the model of a spin chain with anisotropic spin - orbit coupling , in the vicinity of the `` dimer line '' with an exactly known dimerized ground state . </S>",
    "<S> our variational treatment is found to be in a qualitative agreement with the exact diagonalization results . </S>",
    "<S> soliton pairs are shown to be the lowest excitations only in a very narrow region of the phase diagram near the dimer line , and the phase transitions are always governed by magnon - type excitations which can be viewed as soliton - antisoliton bound states . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that when the anisotropy exceeds certain critical value , a new phase boundary appears . in the doped model on the dimer line , </S>",
    "<S> the exact elementary charge excitation is shown to be a hole bound to a soliton . </S>",
    "<S> bound states of those `` charged solitons '' are studied ; exact solutions for @xmath0-hole bound states are presented .    </S>",
