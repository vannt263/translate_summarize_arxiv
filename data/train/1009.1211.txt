    "ho@xmath1ava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity of @xmath2 anisotropic scaling , @xmath3 has been proposed to achieve a theory of quantized gravity , which is believed to be ultraviolet ( uv ) complete and unitary  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that there exists renormalization group ( rg ) flow connecting a higher spatial derivative gravity such as the lifshitz type uv fixed point and general relativity ( gr ) such as the infrared ( ir ) fixed point . though nonexistence of ghost excitation is shown by analyzing the tree - level propagator and it is believed to be power - counting renormalizable due to sixth order spatial derivatives , the hl gravity in its various versions encounters phenomenological inconsistencies , e.g. , unwanted dynamical scalar degree and the related strong gravitational coupling  @xcite , and theoretical difficulties in quantization procedure  @xcite .",
    "a newly proposed version of hl gravity is intriguing since an extra local u(1 ) symmetry to the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism fixes @xmath4 to be unity and eliminates the scalar graviton  @xcite .    in this infant stage of hl gravity",
    "it seems difficult to discuss specifically the rg flows connecting the ir and uv fixed points : not even a single research including direct computation of rg in the context of hl gravity has been performed yet .",
    "it is not so puzzling since , except for some supersymmetric gauge theories or lower - dimensional field theories , it is difficult even in flat @xmath5-dimensional spacetime to find an rg flow possessing both ir and uv fixed points .    a step aside from the issues related to propagating degrees and quantization , there is also an intriguing research direction to find classical configurations by solving equations of motion .",
    "in fact , numerous classical solutions have been obtained in diverse directions , among which the large portion consists of time - dependent cosmological solutions  @xcite and static black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "many of those are given by exact solutions despite complication due to the higher derivative nonlinear equations .",
    "these classical configurations contribute obviously to the understanding classical nature of hl gravity .",
    "however , different from the case of gr or newtonian gravity , direct detection of the evidences of hl gravity from the obtained classical configurations seems extremely difficult in both astrophysical observation in large scale and laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is what can be the usefulness of various classical solutions for the ultimate goal of hl gravity , a quantum gravity",
    ". a specific question may be that whether or not the obtained classical solutions , at least some solutions , can be utilized to constrain possible patterns of the flows connecting the ir and uv fixed points which are presumed to be gr and hl gravity based on @xmath2 anisotropic scaling , respectively .",
    "although it is speculative , we will try to address this question in this paper .",
    "the procedure is given as follows .",
    "first , we consider hl gravity involving the square of the cotton tensor as the unique sixth order spatial derivative term , but the coefficients of lower spatial derivative terms satisfying the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism remain to be arbitrary .",
    "second , we solve the equations of motion in the coordinates compatible with the assigned symmetries and conditions , find classical configurations , in which some of those are given as exact solutions , and read the corresponding geometries .",
    "third , we consider a multidimensional map of parameters of the theory , and the obtained solutions are utilized in dividing the regions in the map .",
    "there are 10 parameters composed of 8 coefficients in front of the lagrangian terms and 2 more constants in the classical solutions .",
    "the selected classical solutions for application to rg flows are required to possess the following nature :    * the solution is generic in the context of hl gravity . here `` generic '' means that the solution is obtained not under a bizarre metric assumption , not by too many surgeries of different geometries , and not in the presence of unphysical matters , unphysical in the scheme of field theories with lifshitz type anisotropic scaling . +",
    "* a solution is found in the wide range of parameters . + * solution reduces to a physically acceptable solution in the gr limit .",
    "note that the aforementioned static solutions fulfill the requirements .",
    "fourth , we examine characteristic of each solution ( geometry ) and classify the corresponding region . the obtained solutions in the realm of hl gravity",
    "are categorized as follows in comparison with gr solutions :    * the usual solutions which appear as physical solutions in gr and of which the corresponding geometries are observed directly or / and indirectly . + * the solutions which are encountered in gr but of which their astrophysical signals seem hardly or unlikely to be detected . + * the solutions which are never obtained in gr or can not be obtained in the physical environment of gr , _",
    "e.g. _ , unphysical solutions under violation of the positive energy theorem .",
    "when a parameter changes smoothly along the line of rg flow at least in the vicinity of the ir fixed point , a classical gr solution changes to be a classical hl solution in one of the above three categories .",
    "if it is category ( i ) , we may call the corresponding parameter region an `` allowed zone . ''",
    "if it is category ( ii ) , we may call the corresponding parameter region a `` disfavored zone . ''",
    "if it is category ( iii ) , we may call the corresponding parameter region an `` unlikely zone . ''",
    "in the subsequent sections , we find classical solutions describing some stringy objects and test our proposal . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , without matter , we solve the equations of motion in the painlev@xmath6-gullstrand type coordinates compatible with the projectability condition and find exact axially symmetric solutions of which planar geometries describe a cone with deficit angle , an excess cone with surplus angle , and a black string with a banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) type horizon . in order to obtain the cone and excess cone configurations in gr , depicted by the same metric",
    ", negative energy density is required in the energy - momentum tensor side of the einstein equations .",
    "therefore , the solution is unphysical in the context of gr . in the vicinity of the ir fixed point with vanishing higher spatial derivative terms ,",
    "these solutions belong to category ( iii ) and the parameter region supporting these configurations may correspond to an unlikely zone .",
    "we categorize the black string into ( ii ) and the parameter region of this solution may correspond to a disfavored zone . an allowed zone keeps the speed of light propagation unity but the gravitational coupling can be changed . in sec .  [ sec3 ]",
    "we solve the equations of motion in the presence of an electrostatic field from a thin filament of charge and find a charged ( black ) string solution [ with reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) type horizons ] . in this metric",
    "the sum of the square of the electric charge and a combination of coefficients in front of two curvature square terms appears so that this square of effective charge is not positive semidefinite . even in the presence of electrostatic field with positive energy density , there is a static solution in which square of the effective charge is negative .",
    "it means that the obtained solution is generic in hl gravity .",
    "however , in the context of gr , the energy density given by the square of the electric field is required to be negative in order to get the same metric solution . in classical electrodynamics ,",
    "this can be interpreted as an attractive coulomb force between the same charges .",
    "since the former violates the positive energy theorem in gr and the latter is not allowed in the maxwell theory , the solution may belong to category ( iii ) and the corresponding parameter region may be an unlikely zone .",
    "since the astrophysical objects with a huge amount of excess charge can hardly be formed due to repulsive nature , the black string solution with the charge greater than a critical value may be categorized into ( ii ) and the corresponding parameter region may be a disfavored zone . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we summarize briefly what we obtained .",
    "then we discuss possible obstacles to jeopardize this speculative proposal and the conditions to put this suggestion forward to a plausible scenario .",
    "in this section we consider hl gravity with the projectability condition but impose the detailed balance condition only in the uv limit . in sec .  [ ss21 ]",
    ", we look for exact classical static vacuum solutions with axial symmetry , and the obtained configurations can describe the straight stringy objects stretched infinitely along the @xmath7 axis . in sec .",
    "[ ss22 ] , we discuss a possible pattern of the rg flows by applying the obtained solutions to the method proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] .",
    "the hl gravity action in ( 1 + 3 ) dimensions is given by @xmath8 the anisotropic scaling in the uv limit lets the time specific and reduces the diffeomorphisms of gr to foliation - preserving diffeomorphisms on the hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "thus the arnowitt - deser - misner decomposition of the metric is well equipped @xmath9 the ir lagrangian density is easily determined by requiring gr as the ir fixed point @xmath10 where the extrinsic curvature is given by @xmath11 in this gr limit with general covariance , the 4 parameters in have the fixed values by the newton s constant @xmath12 , the speed of light @xmath13 , and the cosmological constant @xmath14 as @xmath15    since the @xmath2 scaling still allows 5 sixth order spatial derivative terms  @xcite , inclusion of all the terms makes the theory less predictable .",
    "suppose the detailed balance condition emerges near the uv fixed point and the tensor structure of sixth order spatial derivative terms in the action is determined by the cotton tensor  @xcite @xmath16 the relevant deformations need not follow the detailed balance and then the uv lagrangian density has 4 higher spatial derivative terms @xmath17 though the physical motivation for the introduction of the detailed balance condition is still challenging  @xcite , the assignment of it restricts the number of parameters in the lagrangian densities in and to 8 parameters given in descending order of the number of derivatives @xmath18    reflecting the difficulty in the quantization procedure  @xcite , we adopt the projectability condition in which the lapse function @xmath19 depends only on the time coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "then the time reparametrization , a symmetry transformation in the projectable version of hl gravity , fixes the lapse function to be unity , @xmath21 .",
    "since we are interested in stringy static objects , we assume rotational symmetry in the @xmath22 plane and take the painlev@xmath6-gullstrand type coordinates of which the metric is compatible with the projectability condition @xmath23 ^ 2+r^2d\\theta^2+e^{2h(r)}dz^2 .",

    "<S> the parameters related to the speed of the graviton and the coefficients of quartic spatial derivative terms lead to intriguing effects : the change of graviton speed yields a surplus angle and the quartic derivatives make the square of effective electric charge negative . </S>",
    "<S> the result of a few tests based on the geometries of a cone , an excess cone , a black string , and a charged ( black ) string seems suggestive . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the flow of constant graviton speed and variable newton s coupling can be favored in the vicinity of an ir fixed point , but the conclusion is indistinct and far from definite yet . </S>",
