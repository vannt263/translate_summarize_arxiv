    "later we discuss the behavior of some higher order correlations predicted from pnjl model .    0.1 in",
    "let us consider the baryon - strangeness ( bs ) correlation . in fig.[fg.bs11 ] leading order bs correlation is shown and compared with lqcd data . though there is good qualitative agreement the results have significant difference quantitatively .",
    "this is not very surprising as the inherent physical masses of the constituents in our model and those on the lattice are substantially different - the ratio of pion to kaon mass is about a factor of 2 larger on the lattice than the physical value .",
    "as we shall see this kind of departure remains for almost all the correlations measured on the lattice and in pnjl model .",
    "the bs correlation normalized to the strangeness and baryon number fluctuations respectively are given by @xmath57 where we have used the notation ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it was argued in ref.@xcite that @xmath60 has entirely different behavior in hadron gas and in qgp , and therefore this can be a reasonable diagnostic tool for identifying the nature of the matter formed in heavy - ion collisions through event - by - event fluctuations . in quark phase ,",
    "baryon number and strangeness are strongly correlated through the strange quark indicating @xmath60 should approach its stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) limit as soon as quark quasi - particles are dominant .",
    "the corresponding value for the ratio @xmath61 is -@xmath62 . from fig.[fg.bs11_s2 ] we see that closely above @xmath37 the ratio reaches its sb limit .    0.1 in    at low temperatures in the hadronic phase the situation is different .",
    "numerator of @xmath60 has contributions from strange baryons only , whereas the denominator has contributions from all strange hadrons .",
    "so the ratio approaches zero as the temperature is decreased .",
    "a similar behavior is found in the ratio @xmath63 which gives the bs correlation normalized to the fluctuation of baryon number .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fg.bs11_b2 ] . here",
    "again the high temperature behavior is consistent with a quark quasi - particle picture and at the low temperatures the strange baryon correlation is much smaller than the baryon fluctuation due to the large mass of the strange baryons .",
    "for both these ratios we see a nice qualitative agreement with lattice data though quantitative disagreement persist .    0.1 in    going a step",
    "further we show the behavior of some fourth order correlations - @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in fig.[fg.allbs4 ] . at low @xmath39 , in the hadronic phase",
    ", all three correlations go to zero . on the other hand",
    "the correlations approach their sb limit at temperature close to 2.5@xmath35 . for @xmath67 and @xmath65",
    "there are two cusps , one corresponding to the chiral transition in the light quark sector and the other corresponding to the strange sector .",
    "similar features for diagonal correlators were discussed by us in ref . @xcite .",
    "for @xmath66 the strange sector completely overwhelms the light quark sector as expected , and so there is only one peak at 1.5@xmath35 .",
    "therefore , if somehow these three correlations freeze out earlier than thermal and chemical freeze - out in heavy - ion collision experiments , they will not only be good indicators of the crossover but can also draw the explicit distinction between the chiral transitions in the light and strange quark sectors .    0.1 in",
    "we now turn to baryon - charge ( bq ) correlation . in fig.[fg.bc11 ] leading order correlation is shown . at both very low and at very high temperatures @xmath68 is zero .",
    "this is because at low temperatures the contributions from heavy baryons decrease . on the other hand in the high temperature weakly interacting phase the baryon and charge quantum numbers are completely independent of each other .",
    "the peak in @xmath68 occurs slightly above @xmath35 and is a clean indicator of the crossover .",
    "we show @xmath68 normalized with respect to @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively in other two panels of fig.[fg.allbc2 ] .",
    "these can be expressed in terms of the following : @xmath71 both the ratios go to zero at high @xmath39 . at low @xmath39",
    "the ratios show different behavior .",
    "while @xmath69 becomes small at low temperatures due to heavy baryons , @xmath70 is not so small due to the contributions from light mesons .",
    "thus @xmath72 remains non - zero whereas @xmath73 goes to zero .",
    "interestingly , in case of a complete thermal equilibrium , in the fireball created in heavy - ion collisions , these two quantities , if measured , would give valuable insight into the quantitative aspects of the pnjl model at low temperatures in the hadronic phase .",
    "the difference in lattice and pnjl model studies which is more pronounced below @xmath35 , would then have to confront this measurement in the experiment .    in fig.[fg.allbc4",
    "] we have plotted the 3 fourth order correlation coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "all of them show a pronounced peak close to @xmath35 . among these",
    "@xmath75 is non - zero only at @xmath35 and so is the best indicator of the crossover .",
    "these correlators do not show the double peak structure as contribution from strange sector is subdominant .    0.1 in    in fig.[fg.allcs2 ]",
    "the leading order qs correlation is shown .",
    "as in the case of baryon number , charge is also strongly correlated to strangeness through strange quarks and therefore at high temperature @xmath77 approaches its sb limit . at low temperatures ,",
    "the strangeness carriers become heavier and hence the correlation decreases .",
    "interesting features arise in the ratios , @xmath78 the ratio @xmath79 decreases with decreasing temperature until it reaches @xmath35 .",
    "there it shows a plateau both in pnjl and lattice measurements as most likely this is where hadronic degrees of freedom start to become dominant .",
    "thereafter the ratio again decreases .",
    "this seems to indicate that as we raise the temperature , the strangeness content and hence its correlation keeps on increasing reaching a saturation .",
    "this is suddenly broken by the liberation of new degrees of freedom in terms of quark quasi - particles just above @xmath35 .",
    "more detailed investigation is necessary to confirm this picture .",
    "in retrospect we do expect and see a similar behavior for @xmath63 and @xmath72 though not highly prominent .    at large temperatures",
    "@xmath80 takes up non - zero value @xcite .",
    "however it increases with decreasing temperature due to the same reason as @xmath72 , i.e. , the strangeness fluctuations decrease at a faster rate at lower temperatures .",
    "the saturation effect near @xmath35 is normalized out .    in fig.[fg.allcs4",
    "] we have plotted the fourth order correlations .",
    "all three fourth order correlations @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 show similar behavior as for the bs correlations .",
    "therefore these two sets can be used complementarily to understand the state of affairs in heavy ion collisions .    0.3 in",
    "we have studied the correlations between different conserved charges in the pnjl model .",
    "the baryon - strange ( bs ) , baryon - charge ( bq ) and the charge - strange ( qs ) correlations were obtained by fitting the pressure in a taylor series expansion around vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the ratio of these leading order correlators to the respective quadratic diagonal correlators were obtained .",
    "the results were shown both for the physically bound effective pnjl model ( bep ) as well as the conventional pnjl model without a physical bound ( uep ) .",
    "lattice qcd data exists for the leading order correlators and were contrasted against our calculations .    in general",
    "the comparison with lattice data gave excellent qualitative agreement reproducing all the physical features in all the coefficients that could be compared .",
    "however quantitative differences remain which we believe is mainly due to the difference in effective masses .",
    "interestingly the uep seems to be closer to the lattice results .",
    "one can therefore say that the pnjl model is standing quite strong as an effective model of qcd .",
    "as we discussed in the main text the combined studies of various correlators would give us a clearer picture of the matter created in heavy - ion collision experiments . the leading order",
    "coefficients can be most useful in identifying if the qgp is formed , while the higher order coefficients could identify the crossover region .",
    "we have noted a slight saturation of charge and strangeness through the saturation of the ratios @xmath79 , @xmath63 and @xmath72 in a small temperature region just below @xmath35 .",
    "this is found both in the pnjl model and in lqcd .",
    "perhaps this is when the degrees of freedom crossover from hadronic to the partonic ones .",
    "the higher order correlators containing strangeness show two cusps at around @xmath35 and around 1.5@xmath35 , corresponding to the temperatures where the chiral crossover in the light and strange quark sectors occur .",
    "this widens the temperature range where the fluctuations remain much larger than the values at low temperature thus increasing the scope of identifying the possible existence of the high temperature phase in heavy - ion collisions . on the other hand",
    "the higher order bq correlators have a sharp peak and is an accurate tool to decide the crossover temperature .",
    "even if we are not lucky enough to identify the high temperature phase from the correlations which need to get frozen much before thermal or chemical freeze - out , the various equilibrium thermodynamic measurements of the correlators would help us in determining the finite temperature behavior of the hadronic sector studied theoretically using pnjl model and lattice qcd .    0.2 in",
