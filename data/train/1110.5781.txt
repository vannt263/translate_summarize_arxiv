    "a fundamental problem in the study of disordered systems is to understand to what extent quenched ( i.e. frozen ) randomness modifies the critical properties of a homogeneous ( i.e. non - disordered ) system .",
    "basically , the first question is whether the transition survives in presence of disorder that locally randomizes the thermodynamic parameter which measures the distance from the critical point ( e.g. for a ferromagnet @xmath0 can be randomized by adding a random component to the couplings @xmath1 ) .",
    "if yes , then one can ask whether the critical exponents are modified .",
    "the celebrated harris criterion @xcite states that disorder is irrelevant ( i.e. a sufficiently weak disorder does not change the critical exponents ) if @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the space dimension and @xmath4 is the correlation length critical exponent of the homogeneous model , while it is relevant if @xmath5 .",
    "the case @xmath6 is called marginal and deciding between relevance and irrelevance is a very model - dependent question .    despite much effort , the harris criterion is still far from having a mathematical justification . in the last few years ,",
    "the _ disordered pinning model _",
    "@xcite emerged as a case where the disorder relevance question can be attacked from a rigorous point of view .",
    "this is a class of one - dimensional ( @xmath7 ) models , based on an underlying renewal process with power - law inter - arrival distribution ; the model lives in a random environment , such that the occurrence of a renewal at step @xmath8 is modified with respect to the law of the renewal by a factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables : if @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) there is an energetic gain ( resp .",
    "penalization ) in having the renewal at @xmath8 .",
    "the pinning model exhibits a localization / delocalization phase transition when the average @xmath13 is varied , and in the non - disordered case ( @xmath14 ) the critical point @xmath15 and the critical exponent @xmath4 can be computed exactly ( @xmath4 depends only on the tail exponent of the renewal inter - arrival law ) .",
    "thanks to a series of recent works , the harris criterion has been put on mathematical grounds on this case : it is now proven that , for @xmath16 small , @xmath4 does not change if it is larger than @xmath17 @xcite and it does change as soon as @xmath18 if @xmath19 @xcite . for the pinning model",
    ", the relevance / irrelevance question can be also asked in the following sense @xcite : is the critical point of the disordered model ( quenched critical point ) equal to the critical point of the _ annealed model _",
    ", where the partition function is replaced by its disorder average ?",
    "it turns out that for @xmath16 small the difference of the two critical points is zero if @xmath20 @xcite , while it behaves like @xmath21 if @xmath19 @xcite . in the marginal case @xmath22 , relevance of disorder",
    "has also been shown , though in the weaker sense that the difference between quenched and annealed critical points is non - zero ( it is essentially of order @xmath23 , as argued in @xcite and proven in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a variational approach to the relevance / irrelevance question , based on a large deviation principle , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us also add that , for the pinning model , the correlation length exponent @xmath4 should coincide with the exponent governing the vanishing of the free energy at the critical point : @xmath24 ( this is proven in special situations , e.g. @xcite , but it should be a rather general fact ) . in the rest of this work , @xmath4 will actually denote the free energy critical exponent .",
    "it is widely expected , on general grounds , that correlations in the environment may change qualitatively the harris criterion : in the case of a @xmath3-dimensional system where the correlation between the random potentials at @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays as @xmath27 , weinrib and halperin @xcite predict that the harris criterion is unchanged if @xmath28 ( summable correlations ) , while for @xmath29 the condition for disorder irrelevance should be @xmath30 .",
    "the study of the random pinning model with correlated disorder is still in a rudimentary form . in @xcite",
    "a case with finite - range correlations was studied , and no modification of the harris criterion was found . on the other extreme , in the pinning model of @xcite not only correlations decay in a power - law way , but potentials are so strongly correlated that in a system of length @xmath31 there are typically regions of size @xmath32 , for some @xmath33 , where the @xmath10 take the same value . in this case , the authors of @xcite are able to compute the critical point and to give sharp estimates on the critical behavior for @xmath34 . in particular , they find that an arbitrarily small amount of disorder _ does _ change the critical exponent , irrespective of the value of the non - disordered critical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "hierarchical models on diamond lattices , homogeneous or disordered @xcite , are a powerful tool in the study of the critical behavior of statistical mechanics models , especially because real - space renormalization group transformations  la migdal - kadanoff are exact in this case . in this spirit , in the present work we consider the hierarchical version of the pinning model introduced in the i.i.d . setting in @xcite and later studied in @xcite",
    "the idea is to study a polymer on a diamond hierarchical lattice , interacting with a one - dimensional defect line where the potentials @xmath10 are placed ( cf .",
    "4.2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) for more details on the relation with the non - hierarchical pinning model ) .",
    "thanks to the diamond structure , the partition function for a system of size @xmath35 turns out to be expressed by a simple recursive relation in terms of the partition functions of two systems of size @xmath36 , cf . . at this point",
    "one can ( as we will in the following ) forget about the polymer interpretation and just retain the recursion .",
    "as in the non - hierarchical case , the system exhibits a localization / delocalization phase transition witnessed by the vanishing of the free energy when @xmath37 is smaller than a certain threshold value @xmath38 .",
    "we consider the case where disorder is gaussian and its correlation structure respects the hierarchical structure of the model : the correlation between the potential at @xmath25 and @xmath26 is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the tree distance between @xmath25 and @xmath26 on a binary tree .",
    "the weinrib - halperin criterion in this context would say that disorder is irrelevant if and only if @xmath42 which for @xmath43 ( no correlations ) reduces to @xmath20 as for the i.i.d . case . in terms of a parameter @xmath44 which defines the geometry of the diamond lattice",
    ", the criterion would read equivalently ( cf . ) @xmath45    a closer inspection of the model , however , shows easily that _ the phase transition does not survive _ for @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : k12 ] ) .",
    "when instead correlations are summable ( which corresponds to @xmath47 ) we find , in agreement with , irrelevance if @xmath48 ( see theorem  [ thm : shift ] and proposition  [ prop : comparf ] ) . as for @xmath49 , again we find agreement with the weinrib - halperin criterion : disorder is relevant ( see proposition  [ thm : smooth ] ) and if in addition @xmath50 , the model behaves like in the i.i.d .",
    "case as far as the difference between quenched and annealed critical points is concerned , see theorem  [ thm : shift ] . the crucial step ( and the one which requires the most technical work ) in proving theorem  [ thm : shift ] ( and proposition  [ prop : comparf ] ) is to show that for @xmath51 the gibbs measure of the annealed system near the annealed critical point is close ( in a suitable sense ) to the gibbs measure of the homogeneous system near its critical point ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : boundenc ] and proposition  [ prop : pnc ] ) .",
    "this requires some work , in particular because the annealed critical point is not known explicitly for @xmath52 .",
    "once this is done , the proof of disorder relevance / irrelevance according to @xmath53 can be obtained generalizing the ideas that were developed for the i.i.d . model .",
    "finally , the region @xmath54 reserves somewhat of a surprise : while we are not able to capture sharply the behavior of the annealed model and of the difference between quenched and annealed critical points ( as we do for @xmath51 , see theorem  [ thm : boundenc ] , proposition  [ prop : pnc ] and theorem [ th : diff ] ) , we can prove that the annealed model has a different critical behavior than the homogeneous model with the same value of @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , the contact fraction at the annealed critical point scales qualitatively differently ( as a function of the system size ) than for the homogeneous model , see equation  . in view of theorem",
    "[ thm : boundenc ] mentioned above , this means that if we fix @xmath56 and we increase @xmath57 starting from @xmath58 , at @xmath59 the annealed system has a `` phase transition '' where its critical properties change . as we discuss in section [ sec : k12 ] , this suggests that , while for @xmath50 the annealed free energy near the annealed critical point @xmath60 has a singularity of type @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for @xmath63 the annealed free energy should vanish as @xmath64 with a larger exponent .",
    "let us conclude by discussing how our results would presumably read for the correlated , non - hierarchical disordered pinning model .",
    "if the disorder is gaussian and correlations decay as @xmath27 , then we should get the same results as for the hierarchical model , provided that @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath66 ( non - summable correlations ) there is no phase transition ( the proof of theorem  [ thm : gk>1/2 ] can actually be easily adapted ) , and the annealed system , well defined if @xmath67 , would have a critical behavior different from the homogeneous one if @xmath68 with @xmath4 the free energy critical exponent of the homogeneous pinning model . as a side remark ,",
    "let us recall that dyson @xcite used a _ hierarchical _",
    "ferromagnetic ising model ( which , at least formally , resembles very much our annealed pinning model , cf . ) plus the griffiths correlation inequalities , to derive criteria for existence of a ferromagnetic phase transition for a _ non - hierarchical _ , one - dimensional ising ferromagnet with couplings decaying as @xmath69 .",
    "we stress that , in contrast , in our case there are no available correlation inequalities which would allow to infer directly results on the non - hierarchical pinning model starting from the hierarchical one .",
    "let us now give an overview of the organization of the paper :    @xmath70 in section [ sec : model ] we define the model and give preliminary results , in particular on the homogeneous case , and we state our main results in section [ sec : result ] ;    @xmath70 in section [ sec : k12 ] we discuss the case @xmath46 , showing that the phase transition does not survive ;    @xmath70 in section [ sec : resannealed ] , we study in detail the annealed model , giving first some preliminary tools ( section [ sec : prelim ] ) , then looking at the case @xmath71 and proving theorem [ thm : boundenc ] and proposition [ prop : pnc ] ( section [ sec : ann ] ) , and finally focusing on the case @xmath63 ( section  [ sec : parabola ] ) ;    @xmath70 in section [ sec : var ] we prove disorder irrelevance for @xmath72 , and in section [ sec : rel ] we prove disorder relevance for @xmath73 .",

    "we study the case in which the initial condition is random and given by @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and where @xmath81 is a sequence of centered gaussian variables , whose law is denoted by @xmath82 .",
