    "thermodynamic properties of atomic clusters depend considerably on the cluster size .",
    "it has been shown that the melting temperature of a small spherical particle decreases with the reduction of its radius.@xcite this is due to the substantial increase in the relative number of weakly bounded atoms on the surface in comparison with those in the bulk .",
    "such a size effect on the melting temperature of small particles of different metals having diameters down to 2 - 3 nm has been confirmed in series of experiments.@xcite    however for clusters having sizes smaller than 1 - 2 nm , the melting temperature is no longer a monotonic function of the cluster size .",
    "experiments on sodium clusters na@xmath0 , with number of atoms @xmath1 , have demonstrated that melting temperature as a function of size shows a prominent irregular structure with local maxima.@xcite the origin of the non - monotonic variation in the melting temperature with respect to cluster size lies in interplay between electronic and geometric shell effects in the sodium clusters.@xcite intensive theoretical efforts have been undertaken to identify the details of the geometric and electronic structures underlying the variations in the melting temperature.@xcite    experiments on small cluster ions of tin @xcite and gallium @xcite have confirmed the violation of the linear relationship between the reduction in the melting temperature and the inverse radius of the cluster .",
    "it was discovered that the melting temperature of selected sn@xmath0 and ga@xmath0 clusters , of sizes @xmath2 , can considerably exceed the melting temperature of the corresponding bulk material.@xcite this behavior was explained by the structural differences between the small clusters and the bulk.@xcite    modification of a cluster structure can also be induced by the doping of an impurity or substitution of one or several atoms in a pure cluster with an atom of a different type.@xcite it has been shown that doping of sodium clusters with li , cs and o@xmath3 impurities ( as well as al@xmath4 and ga@xmath4 clusters with a carbon impurity ) results in a decrease of the melting temperature of the cluster.@xcite whereas doping of the icosahedral silver clusters with ni and cu atoms considerably increases the melting temperature.@xcite therefore one can suppose that the thermodynamic properties of a selected cluster can be tuned by doping with an impurity of a particular type .",
    "in this paper we report the results of a systematic theoretical study regarding the effect of impurity on the thermodynamic properties of ni clusters .",
    "we demonstrate that adding a single carbon impurity can result in changes in the melting temperature of an ni@xmath5cluster .",
    "the magnitude of the change induced is dependent upon the parameters of the interaction between the ni atoms and the c impurity .",
    "hence , thermodynamic properties of ni clusters can be effectively tuned by the addition of an impurity .",
    "we also show that the presence of a carbon impurity considerably changes the mobility of atoms in the ni cluster at temperatures close to its melting point .",
    "the choice of ni clusters is stipulated by their high chemical and catalytic reactivity , unique properties and multiple applications in nanostructured materials.@xcite an important example of such an application is the process of the catalytically activated growth of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the mechanism of this process is not yet well understood ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) and knowledge of the specific role of the impurity in the ni catalytic nanoparticle may ascertain whether the carbon nanotube structure and its growth kinetics can be controlled .",
    "the thermodynamic state of the catalytic nanoparticle plays a crucial role on the carbon nanotube growth.@xcite the nanotube growth rate can be obtained by a solution of a set of kinetic equations which include , in particular , the diffusion flux of carbon through the metal particle.@xcite on the other hand the diffusion coefficients depend on the thermodynamic state of the catalytic ni cluster which can , in turn , be tuned by doping with an impurity .",
    "therefore direct molecular dynamics study of carbon diffusion in the ni cluster is important for a reliable estimation of the growth rate of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the study of structural and dynamical properties of the clusters of transition metals is a challenging task due to the presence of unfilled valence",
    "_ d_-orbitals .",
    "the high density of the _ d_-states and their localized character make the direct _ ab initio _ methods computationally very demanding for clusters larger than several dozens of atoms.@xcite in order to describe the structure of clusters of larger sizes , one needs to use approximate methods and model interatomic potentials .",
    "an effective approach for study of transition - metal clusters is the embedded - atom method @xcite which takes into account many - body effects .",
    "the latter appears through the inhomogeneous electron density of the system . in this paper",
    ", the molecular dynamics study of the ni@xmath5cluster has been performed using the sutton - chen @xcite many - body potential which belongs to the family of the embedded - atom types of potentials .",
    "the sutton - chen potential has been shown to reproduce bulk and surface properties of transition metals and their alloys with sufficient accuracy ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) .",
    "the potential energy of the finite system within the sutton - chen model has the following form :    @xmath6 , \\ ] ]    where    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the distance between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a parameter with dimension of energy , @xmath12 is the lattice constant , @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive integers with @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters provided by sutton and chen for nickel have the following values:@xcite @xmath17 ev , @xmath18  @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    the determination of a reliable model potential for the ni ",
    "c interaction is a difficult task . in refs . the binding energy and different charge state of various forms of @xmath22 clusters ( n= 1 - 3 ) were determined using _ ab initio _ density functional calculations based on the three - parameter becke - type gradient - corrected exchange functional with the gradient - corrected correlation functional of lee , yang , and parr ( b3lyp ) @xcite and lanl2dz basis set ( see , e.g. , ref . and references therein ) .",
    "this was done in order to develop a many - body potential for the transition metal ",
    "carbon interaction .",
    "the many - body potential was then successfully used for a molecular dynamics study of the formation of metallofullerenes @xcite and single - walled carbon nanotubes.@xcite    in the present work , however , the interaction between ni atoms and c impurity is modeled by the morse pair potential : @xmath23    we have determined the parameters of the morse potential ( @xmath24 ev , @xmath25 , @xmath26   ) by fitting the ni  c interaction obtained in refs . within the b3lyp / lanl2dz method .",
    "the choice of using the pairwise morse potential is due to its simplicity which allows us to study the influence of the parameters in ( [ morse ] ) on the thermodynamic properties of the c - doped ni@xmath5clusters , keeping a clear physical picture of the process occuring in the system .",
    "the optimized initial geometries of the cluster have been determined by finding local minima on the multidimensional potential energy surface .",
    "we have applied an efficient scheme of global optimization , called the cluster fusion algorithm ( cfa ) .",

    "during the last , decade numerous theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to studying structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of ni clusters ( recent comprehensive reviews can be found in refs . ) .",
