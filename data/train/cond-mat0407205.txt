    "the large kinetic energy makes the schrdinger equation stiff , so that a change of the chemical environment has little effect on the shape of the wavefunction .",

    "let us briefly review the history of augmented wave methods and the pseudopotential approach .",
    "we do not discuss the atomic - orbital based methods , because our focus is the paw method and its ancestors .",
    "the augmented wave methods have been introduced in 1937 by slater @xcite and were later modified by korringa @xcite , kohn and rostokker @xcite .",
    "they approached the electronic structure as a scattered - electron problem .",
    "consider an electron beam , represented by a plane - wave , traveling through a solid .",
    "it undergoes multiple scattering at the atoms .",
    "if for some energy , the outgoing scattered waves interfere destructively , a bound state has been determined .",
    "this approach can be translated into a basis set method with energy and potential dependent basis functions . in order to make the scattered wave problem tractable ,",
    "a model potential had to be chosen : the so - called muffin - tin potential approximates the true potential by a constant in the interstitial region and by a spherically symmetric potential in the atomic region .",
    "augmented wave methods reached adulthood in the 1970s : o.k .",
    "andersen @xcite showed that the energy dependent basis set of slater s apw method can be mapped onto one with energy independent basis functions , by linearizing the partial waves for the atomic regions in energy . in the original apw approach",
    ", one had to determine the zeros of the determinant of an energy dependent matrix , a nearly intractable numerical problem for complex systems . with the new energy independent basis functions , however , the problem is reduced to the much simpler generalized eigenvalue problem , which can be solved using efficient numerical techniques .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of well defined basis sets paved the way for full - potential calculations @xcite . in that case the muffin - tin approximation is used solely to define the basis set @xmath28 , while the matrix elements @xmath29 of the hamiltonian are evaluated with the full potential .",
    "in the augmented wave methods one constructs the basis set for the atomic region by solving the radial schrdinger equation for the spheridized effective potential @xmath30 \\phi_{\\ell , m}(\\epsilon,\\mathbf{r})&=&0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as function of energy .",
    "note that a partial wave @xmath31 is an angular momentum eigenstate and can be expressed as a product of a radial function and a spherical harmonic .",
    "the energy dependent partial wave is expanded in a taylor expansion about some reference energy @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the energy derivative of the partial wave @xmath35 solves the equation @xmath36 \\dot\\phi_{\\nu,\\ell , m}(\\mathbf{r } ) & = & \\phi_{\\nu,\\ell , m}(\\mathbf{r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next one starts from a regular basis set , such as plane - waves , gaussians or hankel functions .",
    "these basis functions are called envelope functions @xmath37 . within the atomic region",
    "they are replaced by the partial waves and their energy derivatives , such that the resulting wavefunction is continuous and differentiable .",
    "@xmath38 \\label{eq : augmentedwave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath39 is a step function that is unity within the augmentation sphere centered at @xmath6 and zero elsewhere .",
    "the augmentation sphere is atom - centered and has a radius about equal to the covalent radius .",
    "this radius is called the muffin - tin radius , if the spheres of neighboring atoms touch .",
    "these basis functions describe only the valence states ; the core states are localized within the augmentation sphere and are obtained directly by radial integration of the schrdinger equation within the augmentation sphere .",
    "the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained for each @xmath37 as follows : the envelope function is decomposed around each atomic site into spherical harmonics multiplied by radial functions .",
    "@xmath42 analytical expansions for plane - waves , hankel functions or gaussians exist . the radial parts of the partial waves @xmath43 and @xmath44 are matched with value and derivative to @xmath45 , which yields the expansion coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if the envelope functions are plane - waves , the resulting method is called the linear augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) method . if the envelope functions are hankel functions , the method is called linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method .    a good review of the lapw method @xcite has been given by singh @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly mention the major developments of the lapw method : soler @xcite introduced the idea of additive augmentation : while augmented plane - waves are discontinuous at the surface of the augmentation sphere if the expansion in spherical harmonics in eq .",
    "[ eq : augmentedwave ] is truncated , soler replaced the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : augmentedwave ] by an expansion of the plane - wave with the same angular momentum truncation as in the third term .",
    "this dramatically improved the convergence of the angular momentum expansion .",
    "singh @xcite introduced so - called local orbitals , which are non - zero only within a muffin - tin sphere , where they are superpositions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 functions from different expansion energies .",
    "local orbitals substantially increase the energy transferability .",
    "sjstedt @xcite relaxed the condition that the basis functions are differentiable at the sphere radius .",
    "in addition she introduced local orbitals , which are confined inside the sphere , and that also have a kink at the sphere boundary . due to the large energy - cost of kinks , they will cancel , once the total energy is minimized .",
    "the increased variational degree of freedom in the basis leads to a dramatically improved plane - wave convergence @xcite .",
    "the second variant of the linear methods is the lmto method @xcite .",
    "a good introduction into the lmto method is the book by skriver @xcite .",
    "the lmto method uses hankel functions as envelope functions .",
    "the atomic spheres approximation ( asa ) provides a particularly simple and efficient approach to the electronic structure of very large systems . in the asa",
    "the augmentation spheres are blown up so that their volume are equal to the total volume and the first two terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : augmentedwave ] are ignored .",
    "the main deficiency of the lmto - asa method is the limitation to structures that can be converted into a closed packed arrangement of atomic and empty spheres .",
    "furthermore energy differences due to structural distortions are often qualitatively incorrect .",
    "full potential versions of the lmto method , that avoid these deficiencies of the asa have been developed .",
    "the construction of tight binding orbitals as superposition of muffin - tin orbitals @xcite showed the underlying principles of the empirical tight - binding method and prepared the ground for electronic structure methods that scale linearly instead of with the third power of the number of atoms .",
    "the third generation lmto @xcite allows to construct true minimal basis sets , which require only one orbital per electron - pair for insulators .",
    "in addition they can be made arbitrarily accurate in the valence band region , so that a matrix diagonalization becomes unnecessary .",
    "the first steps towards a full - potential implementation , that promises a good accuracy , while maintaining the simplicity of the of the lmto - asa method are currently under way . through the minimal basis - set construction",
    "the lmto method offers unrivaled tools for the analysis of the electronic structure and has been extensively used in hybrid methods combining density functional theory with model hamiltonians for materials with strong electron correlations @xcite",
    "pseudopotentials have been introduced to ( 1 ) avoid describing the core electrons explicitely and ( 2 ) to avoid the rapid oscillations of the wavefunction near the nucleus , which normally require either complicated or large basis sets .",
    "the pseudopotential approach traces back to 1940 when c. herring invented the orthogonalized plane - wave method @xcite .",
    "later , phillips @xcite and antoncik @xcite replaced the orthogonality condition by an effective potential , which mimics the pauli - repulsion by the core electrons and thus compensates the electrostatic attraction by the nucleus . in practice ,",
    "the potential was modified , for example , by cutting off the singular potential of the nucleus at a certain value .",
    "this was done with a few parameters that have been adjusted to reproduce the measured electronic band structure of the corresponding solid .",
    "hamann , schlter and chiang @xcite showed in 1979 how pseudopotentials can be constructed in such a way , that their scattering properties are identical to that of an atom to first order in energy .",
    "these first - principles pseudopotentials relieved the calculations from the restrictions of empirical parameters .",
    "highly accurate calculations have become possible especially for semiconductors and simple metals .",
    "an alternative approach towards first - principles pseudopotentials @xcite preceeded the one mentioned above .      in order to construct a first - principles pseudopotential ,",
    "one starts out with an all - electron density - functional calculation for a spherical atom .",
    "such calculations can be performed efficiently on radial grids .",
    "they yield the atomic potential and wavefunctions @xmath48 . due to the spherical symmetry ,",
    "the radial parts of the wavefunctions for different magnetic quantum numbers @xmath49 are identical .    for the valence wavefunctions one constructs pseudo wavefunctions @xmath50 :",

    "the car - parrinello method had been implemented first for the pseudopotential approach .",
    "there seemed to be unsurmountable barriers against combining the new technique with augmented wave methods .",
    "the main problem was related to the potential dependent basis set used in augmented wave methods : the car - parrinello method requires a well defined and unique total energy functional of atomic positions and basis set coefficients .",
    "furthermore the analytic evaluation of the first partial derivatives of the total energy with respect to wave functions , @xmath87 , and atomic position , the forces , must be possible .",

    ", most pseudopotentials fail for high spin atoms such as cr . while it is probably true that pseudopotentials can be constructed that cope even with this situation , a failure can not be known beforehand , so that some empiricism remains in practice : a pseudopotential constructed from an isolated atom is not guaranteed to be accurate for a molecule .",

    "also the paw methods provides some flexibility in the choice of auxiliary partial waves .",

    "this development began with the evaluation for hyperfine parameters from a pseudopotential calculation using the paw reconstruction operator @xcite and is now used in the pseudopotential approach to calculate properties that require the correct wavefunctions such as hyperfine parameters .",
    "the implementation by kresse and joubert @xcite has been particularly useful as they had an implementation of paw in the same code as the ultra - soft pseudopotentials , so that they could critically compare the two approaches with each other .",
    "their conclusion is that both methods compare well in most cases , but they found that magnetic energies are seriously  by a factor two  in error in the pseudopotential approach , while the results of the paw method were in line with other all - electron calculations using the linear augmented plane - wave method .",
    "as a short note , kresse and joubert incorrectly claim that their implementation is superior as it includes a term that is analogous to the non - linear core correction of pseudopotentials @xcite : this term however is already included in the original version in the form of the pseudized core density .    several extensions of the paw have been done in the recent years : for applications in chemistry truly isolated systems are often of great interest . as any plane - wave based method introduces periodic images , the electrostatic interaction between these images can cause serious errors .",
    "the problem has been solved by mapping the charge density onto a point charge model , so that the electrostatic interaction could be subtracted out in a self - consistent manner @xcite . in order to include the influence of the environment , the latter was simulated by simpler force fields using the molecular - mechanics - quantum - mechanics ( qm - mm ) approach @xcite .    in order to overcome the limitations of the density functional theory",
