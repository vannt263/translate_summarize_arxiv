    "the standard @xmath0cdm model ( cf .",
    "* ) explains the formation of cosmological structure in the non - linear regime in a hierarchical way , i.e. large structures are not formed monolithically but by the successive merging of smaller structures ( e.g , . * ? ? ?",
    "recent cosmological simulations also support the idea of hierarchical formation in mond gravity ( @xcite , but see also analytical models of ) .",
    "the hierarchical merging scenario naturally promotes the picture that we should observe collisions of galaxies .",
    "the question that immediately arises is what is the nature of the distribution of the relative speed of such encounters .",
    "observationally there is evidence that some of these collisions actually occur with speeds that are not readily reproduced by simulations of @xmath0cdm structure formation @xcite .",
    "there is , for example , the famous `` bullet cluster '' , an extremely high velocity merger between two galaxy clusters whose relative speed is between 2500 and 4500 km / sec depending on the interpretation of the shock speed and the method used to infer the collision speed ( observations / models , analytical / numerical , n - body / hydro simulations , e.g. ) . at first sight ,",
    "the upper limit of this interval is too high and may be a problem for the standard @xmath1cdm model , but @xcite showed using the millenium cosmological simulation @xcite that the probability of such an event albeit low , is not zero .",
    "there are a number of such high speed encounters in the literature .",
    "one example of such a collision is the so - called `` line - of - sight bullet '' , i.e. abel 576 , with a relative velocity of 3300  km / sec @xcite . furthermore the `` cosmic train wreck '' abel 520 is a collision with a velocity of approximately 1000  km / sec @xcite . the `` dark matter ring '' cluster cl0024 + 17 has a speculated impact velocity of 3000  km / sec @xcite and macs j0025.4 - 1222 has two merging components whose relative velocity was measured to be 2000  km / sec @xcite . in comparison the random dispersion of velocities in these clusters is only about 500 - 1000  km / sec .",
    "a consequence of any high speed collision of mass concentrations seems to be the decoupling or offsetting of the baryons from the dark component . assuming this being the case , additional examples of collisions are given in @xcite but see also @xcite .",
    "this kind of objects , with offsets between baryon and dm components , have become what could be considered as yet another important standard test that any theory for gravity should pass before being seriously considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simply applying the mond formula to a universe populated only with baryons seems to fail this test .",
    "possible solutions could come from many on - going efforts to embed the mond idea in a relativistic framework by adding complementary ( vector ) fields besides the standard einstein s metric or by the addition of neutrinos of various kind .",
    "however we must have in mind , that the same data on the bullet cluster would have rejected general relativity in its original formulation without introducing one or more dark matter components plus a cosmological constant .",
    "the question that arises from all these data is how to match the low probability of high - speed encounters predicted by @xcite for the @xmath0cdm model with the fact that this type of collisions _ seems _ to be common in the observable universe .",
    "a clue comes from the mondian point of view where the situation seems to be more favorable for high velocities .",
    "previous authors have noted the deep potential in mond is helpful in the context of the bullet cluster . on a smaller scale ,",
    "high - velocity stars have been studied in the context of the escape speed in the milky way @xcite .",
    "it was found that mond can retain stars of higher velocity than cdm , and the mondian escape velocity is more consistent with the rave data in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "further , the revised ( yet still discussed ) speed of the magellanic clouds also favors mond @xcite .",
    "the question that previous authors can not address is how to obtain a self - consistent strength of the external field in mond since they lack a full cosmological simulation . and",
    "as mond is a non - linear theory it violates the strong equivalence principle and hence it is _ mandatory to simulate galaxies within the cosmological framework and not in isolation_.    the aim of this paper is not to go further in an explanation of this kind of systems using mondian ideas , but to study the consequences of a mondian cosmological toy model on the probability of such high speed encounters . in order to do this ,",
    "we study the velocity distribution of substructure extracted from cosmological simulations that have been run using standard and modified gravity .",
    "we show that high speed collisions are more frequent in mond than in the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the analysis presented in this _",
    "letter _ is based upon a set of two simulations published in @xcite , i.e. the @xmath0cdm and the ocbmond2 model , respectively . both simulations were run in a box with a side length of @xmath2mpc , using @xmath3 particles .",
    "they were both run with a modification of the @xmath4-body code ` mlapm ` @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model employs a background cosmology parametrized by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and a normalisation of the power spectrum of the density perturbation of @xmath7 . for the mondian simulation",
    ", we chose an open universe with neither dark matter nor dark energy but characterized by @xmath8 . in order to arrive at a comparable evolutionary stage to the @xmath0cdm model at redshift @xmath9 we had to lower the normalisation @xmath10 to @xmath11 due to the faster growth of structures in mond ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both simulations were started at redshift @xmath12 and used a hubble constant @xmath13 km / sec / mpc .",
    "we used the mpi version of the ` ahf ` halo finder ` amiga`s - halo - finder @xcite to identify objects , which is based on the ` mhf ` halo finder of @xcite . for the identification of substructure we employed the tool ` mergertree ` that comes with the ` ahf ` software package .",
    "this algorithm was originally designed to follow halos through time by tracking the membership of individual particles , but it can be also used to locate the subhalos of a given host . since particles that belong to subhalos will belong also to the corresponding host , constructing a merger tree of a halo catalogue with itself will provide us with a `` subhalo tree '' ( rather than a merger tree ) .",
    "it is important at this moment to make a remark about our terminology .",
    "we use the term subhalo to refer to the largest substructures embedded in host haloes .",
    "the mass ratio between our host halos and the most massive subhalo have a median of 0.23 and 0.15 for the mondian and newtonian simulations respectively .",
    "these numbers are in the range of typical mass ratios for collisions in mergers of host halos and are well above the typical ratio between hosts and real substructures ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to not contaminate our result with unvirialized objects we further prune our halo catalogue by removing objects with a high virial ratio ending up with 64 and 58 objects in the newtonian and mondian simulations , respectively .",
    "for more details regarding these simulations , we refer the reader to @xcite",
    "while the primary focus of this _ letter _ is the distribution of the relative velocity of two colliding systems , we still need to define a proper normalisation for these velocities to correct for the fact that a more massive host system will lead to a larger acceleration towards its centre . while others referred to the rotational velocity at the virial radius of the host for this purpose ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we rather use the mass - averaged velocity dispersion .",
    "in the newtonian case , the velocity dispersion scales with the mass @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 , where we used @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the background density , which depends only on redshift . a similar scaling relation between velocity dispersion @xmath18 and mass @xmath14 can be easily obtained for deep mond @xmath19 for a spherical isolated body . although not rigorous , we find that this scaling holds fairly well as a mass - averaged total dispersion of the system even in the intermediate mond regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_m ] shows the @xmath20 relation for the host systems selected in both our simulations .",
    "the lines indicate power laws fits , whose index agrees closely with the theoretical values 1/4 and 1/3 for mondian and newtonian theory , respectively .",
    "the fitted normalisation is higher than the theoretical one , owning to the fact that the simulated halos break the hypothesis of constant density used in the theoretical approach .",
    "special care must be taken when comparing newtonian dark matter simulations to collisionless mondian simulations , especially when it comes to `` haloes '' .",
    "while we set out to use the velocity dispersion of the host system as the normalisation of the collision velocity in order to account for the mass of the host , we have just seen that @xmath20 relations scales differently in mondian than in newtonian physics .",
    "what we need to do now is to move both simulations into the same theoretical framework ( e.g. , cdm ) by applying the same technique outlined in @xcite , i.e. we divide the mondian ( host ) masses by the baryon fraction ( @xmath21 ) to mock dark matter haloes for direct comparison to the @xmath0cdm model . from these `` mondian dark matter halo plus baryon masses ''",
    "we apply the newtonian @xmath20 relation to obtain the appropriate @xmath18 value to compute the normalized @xmath22 .",
    "note that we actually could reverse this procedure and transform the newtonian dark matter haloes into the mondian frame and use the mondian @xmath20 relation to obtain the normalized velocity .",
    "we have applied both methods to our data and the results are consistent with each other .",
    "hence we show the results only for the former method to facilitate direct comparison to other cdm simulations .",
    "having identified each subhalo and its corresponding host ( cf .",
    "section  [ simulations ] ) , we calculate the cumulative probability distribution of the relative velocity between host and its most massive subhalo @xmath23 . the result is shown in figure  [ fig : histo ] .",
    "we can see that the two theories have strikingly different behaviours . both allow high speed satellites but there is a stronger tail towards high - speed in the mondian case .",
    "the shaded lines show the high speed region , where the mondian probability is about four times the newtonian .",
    "the normalisation of the relative speed was chosen in order to eliminate the increased acceleration towards more massive host systems .",
    "the credibility of the approach detailed in section  [ normalisation ] can now be verified by simply dividing our sample into different mass bins .",
    "we confirm that this does not lead to different results even though we decided to not show them in this _ letter _ ; we basically recover the same curves as seen in figure  [ fig : histo ] .",
    "further , our results appear to be robust against slight changes in redshift , i.e. we neither observe a change in the fact that mondian velocities are bigger nor are our results contaminated by the fact that we may capture collisions at a particular time of accidentally high velocity .",
    "the latter is confirmed by analysing the simulations at @xmath24 leading to an indistinguishable plot .",
    "the same conclusion is reached when we experiment with other plausible normalizations or compute the distributions of un - normalised relative speed .    as a final test",
    "we compare our results against a newtonian model that does not contain a cosmological constant @xmath0 , i.e. the open ocbm model of @xcite characterized by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we acknowledge ( though not explicitly shown here ) that the relative velocity distribution of the ocbm model is akin to the @xmath0cdm model presented in figure  [ fig : histo ] ; we therefore ascribe the differences found in that plot to the effects of mond rather than the ( missing ) cosmological constant .",
    "inspired by the observational evidence for high - speed encounters of galaxy clusters we studied the velocity distribution of collisions present in two cosmological simulations , a standard @xmath0cdm model as well as mond . while there may be a problem for @xmath0cdm to accomodate such extraordinary events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we set out to quantify the probabilty for them in mond . within the limitations of our simulations",
    ", we find that there are substantial differences in the collision velocity of objects in the standard model of cosmology and its ( possible ) mondian counterpart .",
    "we observe a much greater likelihood for high - speed collisions in mond and therefore argue that this statistic can be used as a discriminator for the two competing theories .",
    "we further verify numerically the velocity dispersion - mass relation for deep mond gravity whose slope is different to the newtonian case ( @xmath27 for mond instead of @xmath28 for newtonian physics ) .",
    "there is a mild scatter about these relations .",
    "we close with a cautionary note : the box size of our simulation ( @xmath2mpc ) is too small to find objects _ directly _ comparable to systems like the bullet cluster .",
    "the collisional velocity expected for the bullet cluster ( @xmath29 ) is close to the limit of what we resolve in figure  [ fig : histo ] . while the current result is interesting , and the rescaled @xmath22 is likely insensitive to details of the simulation setup , more simulations ( e.g. , with a possible neutrino component and a cosmological constant in mond ) are required to understand how our prediction depends on the cosmological model employed .",
    "nevertheless , our results here may have far - reaching implications as well .",
    "historically , dark matter and mond are competing theories .",
    "recent studies argue that mond is a prescription for interactions of a coupled dark energy - dark matter field .",
    "effectively mond is made by a non - uniform dark energy field .",
    "the places where this field condenses are identified as dark halos .",
    "our results here could argue that we might differentiate between theories with interacting dark matter - dark energy vs. classical @xmath0cdm using data of high speed encounters .",
    "it is encouraging that some subtle differences on how the dark sector self - interacts could leave signatures on  large astronomical colliders \" ( lac ) .",
