    "one of the limiting factors found in the race to get large scale applications from @xmath0 superconductors is their granular character which constitutes a severe handicap to obtain large values of critical current densities .    from today",
    "s variety of @xmath0 superconducting materials , bismuth tapes seem to be the best solution when we are looking for good mechanical properties and low cost performance figures ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the highest values of critical current densities are obtained in @xmath2 thin films , so this material can not be discarded as a possibility for current carrying applications @xcite .",
    "it is generally observed that these thin films grow through a nucleation process resulting in `` islands '' or `` columnar grains '' @xcite .",
    "the existence and nature of weak links between these columnar grains have been the subject of debate for years since they are strongly dependent on the deposition technique , the substrate , and deposition parameters .",
    "however , there is a general agreement that in thin films , contrary to what happens in ceramic superconductors , transport properties are dominated by pinning mechanisms instead of josephson effects .    in spite of this general belief ,",
    "a great fraction of the published data in the field shows the presence of low and large angle boundaries between grains in @xmath3 films , ( particularly polycrystalline ) , and at the same time , careful studies of chaudhary et al @xcite and gross @xcite demonstrated that high angle grain boundaries drastically reduce the critical current of the junctions . to clarify the role of those boundaries , and of the pinning centers on the resulting critical current density",
    ", we developed a simple model for the transport properties of thin film superconductors .",
    "the critical current density within each superconducting grain is assumed to change with the field following a kim - like model @xcite as :    @xmath4    where the subscript @xmath5 stands for the different directions of the current ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the magnetic field applied to the sample , and @xmath8 is a parameter to be determined experimentally .",
    "this equation can be writen in the following more convenient form for computational purposes :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 represents a normalized magnetic field , and @xmath11 is a parameter which depends on the relation between the field orientation and the sample axis .",
    "following figure 1 , the values of @xmath11 considered were : if @xmath12 , @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 ; if @xmath18 ( @xmath19 along @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 for @xmath15 , @xmath22 for @xmath17 and @xmath16 for @xmath14 . to choose these values",
    ", we assumed that the intragranular current was depressed only by magnetic fields perpendicular to the current flow , and that the intrinsic pinning ( i.e. that acting on the vortices lying parallel to the @xmath23 planes when forced to move perpendicular to them ) was an order of magnitude stronger than other sources of pinning @xcite .",
    "up to this point , the model describes the field dependance of the critical current density in an _ homogeneous _ medium ( i.e. , not _",
    "weak _ links between grains ) .",
    "however , if between the grains of the thin film high angle tilt boundaries exist , the problem becomes more complicated .",
    "in fact , if between two grains a high angle tilt boundary exists , the _ intergranular _ critical current density follows the well - known fraunhoffer patern for a short josephson junction @xcite :    @xmath24    where the prefactor @xmath25 depends on the angle boundary , @xmath26 is the magnetic flux at the junction , and @xmath27 is the flux quantum .",
    "now , we can rewrite ( [ eq : jc_junturas_o ] ) as a function of @xmath28 , and , after a straightforward algebra , it is transformed in :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 for @xmath12 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 are represented in figure 1 ) .",
    "a granular thin film can not be modeled as a pure ceramic superconductor since , having just a small fraction of high angle tilt boundaries , we can find paths of high critical current densities were its dependence with the applied field is determined by the equation ( [ eq : jc_granos ] ) .",
    "so , to model the system we proposed a tridimensional array of grains , a fraction @xmath35 of them was strongly coupled ( which means with misorientation angle smaller than @xmath36 occur between grains @xcite ) , while a fraction @xmath37 is coupled through weak links produced by high angles between grains . for the strongly coupled grains",
    "the critical current density was detertermined by means of ( [ eq : jc_granos ] ) , while for the weakly coupled grains equation ( [ eq : jc_junturas ] ) was used .",
    "the calculation of the critical current density of the system was based on the minimum cut algorithm already used to solved similar problems @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows the calculation of the maximum flow in a random system .",
    "it is basically composed by two operations .",
    "a first one to determine the paths on the system where the current can flow , and a second one to augment the flow ( of current ) at the bonds ( our links between grains ) . once it is impossible to find a new path or to augment the flow through the already found paths , we say we obtained the maximum current ( critical current ) of the system .",
    "we choose for our simulations @xmath38 for @xmath12 which corresponds to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath43 as typically reported for @xmath2 films ( see figure1 ) @xcite .",
    "kim s characteristic field @xmath44 was assumed .",
    "the possibility of modeling granularity in such anisotropic fashion ( but only in the light of a simple parallel ensemble of josephson junctions ) has been suggested earlier by altshuler et al @xcite .",
    "we used systems of dimensions @xmath45 ( which mimics a @xmath46 bridge performed on a thin film with average grain diameter of @xmath47 ) and averaged over 10 different configurations to improved the statistics .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 was always varied between 0 and 3 .",
    "one more remark about the different configurations used is needed . if the applied field points parallel to the @xmath1 direction , junctions perpendicular to the @xmath23 plane ( shaded in figure 1 ) are affected by equation ( [ eq : jc_junturas ] ) , while , if it is applied parallel to the @xmath23 plane , junctions lying in that plane are not affected .",
    "to approach real values of @xmath2 films we extracted @xmath25 and @xmath35 from the combination of two experimental results : the statistics of boundaries angles in a @xmath2 films reported by @xcite , and the angle dependence of the critical current density measured by ivanov et al @xcite on @xmath2 bycristals .",
    "figure 2 shows the simulated field dependence of the critical current density corresponding to films with different microstructures .",
    "the upper curve represents the critical current versus field dependence of a system without weak - links , while the lower contains a @xmath48 of high angle boundaries .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 of these boundaries reduce the critical current by approximate factors of 2 and 100 respectively , corresponding to misorientation angles of @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "as observed in figure 2 the introduction of weak - links provokes a reduction of the zero field critical current density by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "it also induces a steeper @xmath54 characteristic in the `` low field '' region , and several maxima which suggests a superposition of josephson patterns , as observed in @xmath2 polycrystals with a small number of grains @xcite .    to model a better sample",
    ", we calculated @xmath55 for a system without boundaries reducing the critical current by a factor 100 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 , were the critical current density as a function of @xmath10 is plotted for a set of systems with @xmath35 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . even in this case",
    "the critical current density depends on the number of weak - links .",
    "however , interestingly enough , the suppression of the `` worst '' boundaries does nt improve significantly the critical current density at zero field .",
    "this suggests that the number of weak - links is more important than their `` weakness '' regarding the absolute values of the critical current .",
    "to further explore this idea in figure 4 , we compared the critical current dependencies with the applied field of samples with different kinds of weak - links and @xmath58 .",
    "the upper curve represents angles in the range @xmath59 , i.e. reducing @xmath60 by a factor of 2 , while the remaining curves represent angles of @xmath61 and @xmath62 which roughly reduce the critical current by 4 , 10 , 100 and 10000 respectively @xcite .",
    "the figure shows again similar @xmath60 vs @xmath10 dependencies for high values of the angles . for high fields",
    "all the curves behave in the same manner , indicating that , in this regime , the number of weak links is more important than their quality .",
    "however , for zero field , different values of critical current densities are obtained depending on the misorientation angle between grains .",
    "figure 5 shows this dependence , demonstrating that angles greater than @xmath63 , do not considerably change the critical current densities values , while a strong improvement in @xmath55 can be obtained by diminishing the angle below @xmath63 , which is qualitatively coherent with the data of wu et al @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the field dependence of the critical current density for the @xmath32 configuration .",
    "when compared with the figure 3 , the effect of an anisotropic set of parameters is revealed in a less strong field dependence of @xmath60 . however , the depression in the zero field critical current density is roughly similar to the @xmath12 configuration . here",
    "the weak - linked component also introduces a steep @xmath54 characteristics in the `` low field '' region , while josephson assembly - like maxima are observed as @xmath35 decreased .",
    "from these results we conclude that the presence of high angle boundaries reduces the critical current density of superconducting thin films and provokes a transition form pinning - mediated to fraunhoffer - like patterns in its magnetic field dependencies .",
    "our results also suggest that the amplitude of the misorientation angles between grains _ does not _ change the values of critical current density for high values of the applied field , while for low applied field , differences appear only for small angle values .",
