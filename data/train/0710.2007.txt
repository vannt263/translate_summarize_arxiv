    "the notion of a singularity in general relativity significantly differs from that in other field theories . in the absence of a background metric",
    ", one has to detect the presence of singularities by showing that the space - time is incomplete  in some sense . in the standard approach to singularities ( see , e.g. , hawking and ellis  ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) ) , a singularity is regarded as an obstruction to extending geodesics . however",
    ", this definition does not correspond very closely to ones physical intuition and classifies many space - times that have been used to model physically reasonable scenarios as being singular .",
    "such weakly singular  space - times have long been used to describe , for example , impulsive gravitational waves , shell - crossing singularities and thin cosmic strings .",
    "typically these space - times admit a metric that is locally bounded but its differentiability is below @xmath0 ( i.e. , the first derivative locally lipschitz )  the largest differentiability class where standard differential geometric properties , such as existence and uniqueness of geodesics , remain valid . for a recent review on the use of metrics of low regularity in general relativity ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "this set of problems has stimulated considerations of whether physical objects would be subjected to unbounded tidal forces on approaching the singularity and was formulated mathematically in terms of strong curvature conditions .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to model the behaviour of real physical objects in a strong gravitational field . this led clarke  @xcite to suggest that one consider the behaviour of physical fields ( for which one has a precise mathematical description ) near the singularity instead . according to this philosophy of generalised hyperbolicity",
    "one should regard singularities as obstructions to the cauchy development of these fields rather than as an obstruction to the extension of geodesics .    however , the weak singularities mentioned above are obstructions if one formulates the cauchy problem for the wave equation in the standard theory of distributions .",
    "more precisely , there is no generally valid distributional solution concept for the wave equation on a space - time with a non - smooth metric .",
    "the equation , although linear , involves coefficients of low regularity that can not be multiplied with the distributional solution .",
    "to resolve this problem in the case of shell - crossing singularities , clarke  @xcite introduced a specific weak solution concept ( called _ @xmath1-global hyperbolicity _ ) to prove unique solvability of the wave equation , hence showing that these space - times , indeed , satisfy the conditions of generalised hyperbolicity . on the other hand ,",
    "vickers and wilson  @xcite used the setting of colombeau algebras  @xcite to arrive at a valid formulation of the cauchy problem for the wave equation on conical space - times ( modelling a thin cosmic string ) and showed the existence and uniqueness of solutions in a suitable algebra , @xmath2 , of generalised functions .",
    "hence they showed that conical space - times are generalised hyperbolic or , more precisely , @xmath2-hyperbolic .",
    "vickers and wilson also showed that their unique generalised solution corresponds to the forbidden  distributional solution expected on physical grounds ( via the concept of association  see section  [ geomth ] below ) .",
    "their key tool is a refinement of the energy estimates for hyperbolic pdes ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.4 ) , ( * ? ?",
    "* sec.4.4 ) ) , which makes them applicable in the new situation .    in this paper , we generalise this method to a much wider class of weakly singular space - times and",
    "prove @xmath2-hyperbolicity for this class . since our approach is based on regularisation of the singular metric by sequences of smooth ones , we must put restrictions on the growth of the sequence with respect to the regularisation parameter @xmath3 .",
    "essentially we shall assume ( see section  [ definitions2 ] ) asymptotic local uniform boundedness with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "recall that the space - times of interest here typically possess a locally bounded metric .",

    ".2 cm this work is organised in the following way .",
    "in section  [ prereq ] we fix our notation , recall some facts on the geometric theory of generalised functions and define our class of weakly singular space - times ( section  [ definitions2 ] ) .",
    "we state our main result in theorem  [ mainthm ] of section  [ mainresult ] : given a point @xmath5 in a weakly singular space - time , there exists a neighbourhood , @xmath6 , of @xmath5 such that the initial value problem for the wave equation admits a unique solution in @xmath7 . the proof is split into several steps : ( generalised ) higher order energy integrals are introduced and proved to be equivalent to suitable sobolev norms in section  [ eint ] . the energy estimates are provided in section  [ partb ] , while some auxiliary estimates are proved in section  [ auxest ] . finally these results are collected to provide the proof of the main theorem in section  [ proof ] .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we give a precise definition of the class of weakly singular metrics that we are going to consider in the sequel . prior to that , and for the convenience of the reader , we give a brief summary of the geometric theory of generalised functions in the sense of colombeau .",

    "one uses a sheaf - theoretical construction which can be lifted to the manifold using a partition of unity . from the explicit formula ,",
    "it is clear that the embedding commutes with partial differentiation .",

    "@xcite for the tensor case ) .",
    "however , since we will model our weakly singular metrics in generalised functions from the start ( see sec .",
    "[ definitions1 ] and the discussion at the end of section  [ definitions2 ] below ) we have chosen to work in the so - called special setting which is technically more accessible . note that this is in contrast to  @xcite .",

    "all estimates are only required to hold for @xmath3 small enough , that is there exists @xmath46 such that for all @xmath47 the respective statement holds . however , in order not to unnecessarily complicate our formulations we will notationally suppress this fact most of the time .    the @xmath15-module of generalised sections in vector bundles  especially the space of generalised tensor fields @xmath48  is defined along the same lines using analogous asymptotic estimates with respect to the norm induced by any riemannian metric on the respective fibers .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use the following algebraic description of generalised tensor fields @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the space of smooth tensor fields and the tensor product is taken over the module @xmath51 .",
    "hence generalised tensor fields are just given by classical ones with generalised coefficient functions .",
    "many concepts of classical tensor analysis carry over to the generalised setting  @xcite , in particular lie derivatives with respect to both classical and generalised vector fields , lie brackets , exterior algebra , etc .",
    "moreover , generalised tensor fields may also be viewed as @xmath15-multilinear maps taking generalised vector and covector fields to generalised functions , i.e. , as @xmath15-modules we have @xmath52    finally , in light of the schwartz impossibility result  @xcite , the setting introduced above gives a minimal framework within which tensor fields may be subjected to nonlinear operations , while maintaining consistency with smooth geometry and allowing an embedding of the distributional geometry as developed in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interplay between generalised functions and distributions is most conveniently formalised in terms of the notion of _ association_. a generalised function @xmath18 is called associated to zero , @xmath53 , if one ( hence any ) representative @xmath54 converges to zero weakly .",

    "note that we work exclusively with representatives of generalised metrics that are classical metrics for each @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath63 is lorentzian , i.e. , there exists a representative which is lorentzian , we call the pair @xmath71 a _ generalised space - time_.    a generalised metric induces a @xmath15-linear isomorphism from @xmath72 to @xmath73 . the inverse of this isomorphism gives a well - defined element of @xmath74 ( i.e. , independent of the representative @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is the inverse metric , which we denote by @xmath76 , with representative @xmath77 .",
