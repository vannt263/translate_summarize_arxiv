    "quantum dots , routinely made by electrostatically confining a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite , have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "the interest in these low - dimensional structures stems from the fact that their physics is controlled by quantum effects .",
    "furthermore , while sharing many similarities with real atoms , quantum dots manifest intriguing low - energy quantum phenomena , which are specific to them .",
    "this is because their properties can be influenced by external factors such as the geometry or the shape of the confining potential and the application of external fields .",
    "clearly some of these features are not accessible in real atoms .",
    "research in the past has been motivated by the possibility of developing novel quantum dot based devices in both the fields of quantum cryptography / computing @xcite and spintronic @xcite , as well as by the simple curiosity of exploring the properties of many - electron systems in reduced dimensions .",
    "quantum rings represent a particular class of quantum dots @xcite , where electrons are confined in circular regions @xcite .",
    "the circular geometry can sustain an electrical current , which in turns can be induced by threading a magnetic flux across the ring itself .",
    "such a magnetic flux produces exciting effects like ahanorov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations @xcite and persistent currents @xcite , effects that were anticipated as early as the late 60 s @xcite . in one dimension ( 1d )",
    "the persistent currents have been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "these , as many other physical properties of the ring , are a periodic function of the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the planck s constant , @xmath2 the speed of light and @xmath3 the electron s charge ) .    a number of earlier theoretical studies @xcite on persistent currents focused on unveiling the role of electron correlations and disorder over the electron transport .",
    "this line of research is inspired by the fact that electronic correlation in 1d always leads to non - fermionic low - energy quasiparticle excitations .",
    "in fact , even in the presence of weak interaction , 1d fermions behave differently from a fermi liquid and their ground state is generally referred to as luttinger liquid .",
    "this possesses specific collective excitations @xcite .",
    "there are two theoretical frameworks commonly used to study finite 1d rings @xcite .",
    "the first is based on the continuum model , where electrons move in a uniform neutralizing positive background and interact via coulomb repulsion , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath3 the electron charge , @xmath6 the distance between two electrons ) .",
    "the second is populated by lattice models , where the electronic structure is written in a tight - binding form and the electron - electron interaction is commonly described at the level of hubbard hamiltonian @xcite . in both frameworks",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) has been the preferential solving strategy for small systems ( small number of sites and electrons ) @xcite .",
    "additional methods used to study quantum rings over lattice models include bethe ansatz ( ba ) @xcite , renormalization group @xcite and density matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "in contrast the continuum model has been tackled with self - consistent hartree fock techniques @xcite , bosonization schemes @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , current - spin density functional theory @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite .",
    "many of the methods developed for solving lattice models for interacting electrons suffer from a number of intrinsic limitations connected either to their large computational overheads or to the need of using a drastically contracted hilbert space .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) can be a natural solution to these limitations .",
    "dft is a highly efficient and precisely formulated method @xcite , originally developed for the coulomb interaction ( this is commonly known as _",
    "ab initio _ dft ) , and then extended to lattice models @xcite .",
    "lattice dft ( ldft ) is based on the rigorously proved statement that the ground state of an interacting electron system is a universal functional of the local site occupation .",
    "the functional , as in _ ab initio _ dft , is unknown explicitly .",
    "however all the many - body contributions to the total energy can be incorporated in a single term , the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy , for which a hierarchy of approximations can be constructed .",
    "the most commonly used approximation for the xc energy in _ ab initio _ dft is probably the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , where the exact ( unknown ) xc energy is replaced by that of the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the theory is then expected to work best in situations close to those described by the _ reference _ system , i.e. close to the homogeneous electron gas . since in 1d fermi liquid",
    "theory breaks down , the homogeneous electron gas is no longer a good reference .",
    "for the homogeneous hubbard model it was then proposed @xcite to use instead the ba construction of lieb and wu @xcite .",
    "such a scheme was then applied successfully to a wide range of situations @xcite and more recently it has been extended to time - dependent problems @xcite and to the 3d hubbard model @xcite .",
    "ldft can be further extended to include the action of a vector potential , i.e. it can be used to tackle problems where a magnetic flux is relevant .",
    "this effectively corresponds to the construction of current - ldft ( cldft ) .",
    "such an extension of ldft was proposed recently for one - dimensional spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interaction @xcite and it is here adapted to the repulsive hubbard model .",
    "the newly constructed functional is then used to investigate total energies , persistent currents and drude weights of a mesoscopic repulsive hubbard ring threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the theoretical foundations leading to the construction of cldft and to its lda .",
    "then we present our results for both homogeneous and defective rings , highlighting the main capabilities and limitations of our scheme , and finally we conclude .",
    "current - dft ( cdft ) is a generalization of time - dependent density functional theory @xcite to include in the hamiltonian an external vector potential @xcite . in this case",
    "the theory is constructed over two fundamental quantities , namely the electron density , @xmath7 , and the paramagnetic current density , @xmath8 .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite is thus expanded to the statement that the ground state @xmath7 and @xmath8 uniquely determine the ground - state wave - function and consequently the expectation values of all the operators @xcite .",
    "equally important is the fact that the standard kohn - sham construction can also be employed for cdft , so that the many - body problem can be mapped onto a fictitious single - particle one , with the two sharing the same ground state @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "practically one then needs to solve self - consistently a system of single - particle equations . also for cdft",
    "all the unknown of the theory are incorporated in the xc energy , which then needs to be approximated .",
    "the scope of this section is to describe how _ ab initio _ cdft has been translated to lattice models and how a suitable approximation for the xc energy associated to the hubbard hamiltonian can be constructed .",
    "our description follows closely the one previously given by dzierzawa et al .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    "a vector potential , @xmath9 , enters into a lattice model via peierls substitution @xcite , where the matrix elements of the @xmath9-dependent hamiltonian , @xmath10 , can be written in terms of those for @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath2 is the speed of light and @xmath13 is the generic orbital located at the position @xmath14 and belonging to the basis set ( here assumed orthogonal ) used to construct the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "when the peierls substitution is applied to the construction leading to the 1d hubbard model the only term in the hamiltonian that gets modified is the kinetic energy @xmath15 .",
    "this takes the form @xmath16 where we have considered a system comprising @xmath17 atomic sites ( note that the ring boundary conditions imply @xmath18 ) . in the equation ( [ ekin ] )",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron of spin @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) at the @xmath23-site , @xmath24 is the hopping integral and @xmath25 is the phase associated to the @xmath23-th bond , which effectively describes the action of @xmath9 .",
    "the remaining terms in the hamiltonian are unchanged so that the 1d hubbard model in the presence of a vector potential is defined by @xmath26 where \\{@xmath27 } is the external potential ( @xmath27 is the on - site energy of the @xmath23-site ) , while the coulomb repulsion term is @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the coulomb repulsion energy and @xmath30 . throughout this work",
    "we always consider the diamagnetic ( non - spin polarized ) case so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the first step in the construction of a cldft is the formulation of the problem in a functional form .",
    "the basic variables of the theory are the site occupation @xmath33 and bond paramagnetic current , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the many - body wavefunction and the bond paramagnetic current operator is defined as @xmath36 in complete analogy to _ ab initio _ cdft we can write the total energy , @xmath37 , of the hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) as a functional of the local external potentials and phases @xmath38+\\sum_lv_l^\\mathrm{ext}n_l+\\sum_l\\phi_lj_l,\\ ] ] so that @xmath39 @xmath40 $ ] is a universal functional , whose functional derivatives with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy the following two equations @xmath43 note that equations ( [ lf1 ] ) through ( [ lf3 ] ) follow directly from the properties of the legendre transformation .    in order to make the theory practical one",
    "has now to introduce the auxiliary single - particle kohn - sham system .",
    "this is described by a single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath44 , whose ground state site occupations and bond paramagnetic currents are identical to those of the interacting system [ described by equation ( [ hint ] ) ] .",
    "@xmath44 reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the associated local effective potentials and phases are @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the single - particle schrdinger equation is then @xmath49 and the site occupation is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the occupation number .",
    "an analogous expression can be written for @xmath52 .",
    "the energy functional associated the kohn - sham system , @xmath53 , can be constructed by performing again a legendre transformation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total energy of the single - particle system and the following two equations are valid @xmath56 the crucial point is that in the ground state the real and the kohn - sham systems share the same site occupation and paramagnetic current , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus one is now in the position of defining the xc energy , @xmath59 , as usual , i.e. as the difference between @xmath60 for the interacting and the kohn - sham systems after the classical hartree energy @xmath61 has also been subtracted , @xmath62=\\mathcal{f}[n_l , j_l]-\\mathcal{f}^\\mathrm{s}[n_l , j_l]-\\mathcal{e}^\\mathrm{h}[n_l]\\:.\\ ] ] note that for all the functionals in equation ( [ xcene ] ) we took the short notation @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. the functionals depend on all the on - site occupations and bond paramagnetic currents .",
    "the single - particle effective potentials and phases can now be defined .",
    "in fact by taking the functional derivative of equation ( [ xcene ] ) with respect to @xmath65 and @xmath66 and by using the equations ( [ lf3 ] ) and ( [ lf4 ] ) one obtains @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the hartree potential .",
    "finally @xmath59 can be re - written in terms of the expectation values of the original hamiltonian .",
    "in fact by substituting the functional forms of @xmath60 and @xmath53 into the equation ( [ xcene ] ) , @xmath71\\:,\\ ] ] by using the equations ( [ hint ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) , @xmath72 and again by substituting equation ( [ vsvl ] ) into equation ( [ exc2 ] ) , one obtains a close expression for the xc energy @xmath73.\\ ] ]    once the theory is formally established the remaining task is that of finding an appropriate approximation for @xmath59 . as for the case of standard ldft @xcite ,",
    "the strategy here is that of considering the ba solution for the homogeneous limit of @xmath74 ( this is defined in equation ( [ hint ] ) by setting @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) and then of taking its local density approximation @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xcite , i.e. @xmath79=\\sum_le^\\mathrm{xc}[n_l , j_l],\\ ] ] where @xmath80={\\mathcal{e}^\\mathrm{xc}[n , j]/l}$ ] is the xc energy density ( per site ) of the homogeneous system .",
    "the first term of the equation ( [ exc3 ] ) can be calculated exactly using the ba procedure @xcite .",
    "this provides the ground state energy as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath81 , so that one still needs to re - express it in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath82 .",
    "however the phase variable @xmath81 can be eliminated from the ground state energy by using @xmath83    thus finally one can explicitly write @xmath84 ( the full derivation for the 1d hubbard hamiltonian is presented in the appendix ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the equations above @xmath87 and @xmath88 are respectively the non - interacting ground state energy and charge stiffness , while @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the same quantities for the interacting case as calculated from the ba .",
    "finally , the xc contributions to the kohn - sham potential can be obtained by simple functional derivative ( in this case by simple derivative ) of the exchange and correlation energy density with respect to the fundamental variables @xmath7 and @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath92 where balda , as usual , stands for bethe ansatz local density approximation .    :",

    "also for cldft there is a divergence in the @xmath7-derivative of both @xmath95 and @xmath96 at half - filing ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is in correspondence of the metal - insulator - transition present in the 1d hubbard model for finite @xmath97 . in the case of @xmath96",
    "the divergence is also in @xmath96 itself .    the solution of the kohn - sham problem proceeds as follows .",
    "first an initial guess for the site occupations is used to construct the initial local paramagnetic current density .",
    "then , the functional derivatives of equations ( [ vxc1 ] ) and ( [ phixc1 ] ) are evaluated at these given @xmath7 and @xmath82 so that the kohn - sham potential is constructed .",
    "the kohn - sham equations are then solved to obtain the new set of kohn - sham orbitals from which the new orbital occupations and bond paramagnetic currents are calculated [ by using equation ( [ occup ] ) ] .",
    "the procedure is then repeated untill self - consistency is reached , i.e. until the potentials ( or the densities ) at two consecutive iterations vary below a certain threshold .",
    "after convergence is achieved the total energy for the interacting system is calculated from @xmath99-\\mathcal{e}^\\mathrm{h}[n_l]-\\sum_lv_l^\\mathrm{xc}n_l,\\ ] ] where the first term is the sum of single - particle energies and the other terms are the so - called _",
    "double counting _ corrections .",
    "we now discuss how cldft performs in describing both the energetics and the transport properties of 1d hubbard rings in presence of a magnetic flux . for small rings our results",
    "will be compared with those obtained by diagonalizing exactly the hamiltonian of equation ( [ hint ] ) , while cldft for large rings will be compared with the ba solution .",
    "first we will consider homogeneous rings and then we will explore the single impurity problem .      in this section",
    "we focus our attention on discussing the general features of cldft applied to homogeneous hubbard rings threatened by a magnetic flux , i.e. on the performance of cldft in describing the ahanorov - bohm effect .",
    "we start our analysis by comparing the cldft results with those obtained by ed .",
    "since ed is numerically intensive such a comparison is limited to small systems .    in figure [ 12_6low_lying_stateu0_u2_u4_u6 ]",
    "we present the first low - lying energy levels , @xmath37 , calculated by ed as a function of the magnetic flux , @xmath81 , for a small 12-site ring at quarter filling ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "in particular we present results for the non - interacting case [ panel ( a ) ] and for the interacting one at three different interaction strengths : ( b ) @xmath101 , ( c ) @xmath102 and ( d ) @xmath103 .",

    "the black dotted lines represent ed results while the dashed red ones are for cldft .",
    "note that for the non interacting case , @xmath109 , in panel ( a ) there is no difference between cldft and ed .",
    "panels ( b)-(d ) are for the interacting case at different interaction strengths : ( b ) @xmath101 , ( c ) @xmath102 and ( d ) @xmath103 . in panel ( b ) the blue arrows indicate the region where the triplet state becomes the ground state.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as the electron - electron interaction is turned on the non - interacting spectrum gets modified in two ways .",
    "firstly there is a second branch in the ground state energy as a function of @xmath81 appearing at around @xmath110 ( see the blue arrows in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ 12_6low_lying_stateu0_u2_u4_u6 ] ) .",
    "this originates from the degeneracy lifting between the single and the triplet solution at @xmath110 , with the triplet being pushed down in energy and becoming the ground state .",
    "the @xmath81 region where the ground state is a triplet widens as the interaction strengths increases .",
    "the second effect is the expected reduction of the ground state total energy as a function of @xmath97 .    since cldft is a ground state theory , it provides access only to the ground state energy , @xmath37 .",
    "this is calculated next and plotted in figure [ 12_6low_lying_stateu0_u2_u4_u6 ] in the interval @xmath111 for different @xmath97 .",
    "as one can clearly see from the figure the performance of cldft is rather remarkable , to a point that the cldft energy is practically identical to that calculated with ed .",
    "however cldft completely misses the cusps in the @xmath112 profile arising from the crossover between the singlet and the triplet state .",
    "level crossing invalidates the ba approximation leading to the interacting xc energy [ see equation ( [ fluxdependence3 ] ) in the appendix ] and so failures are expected @xcite .",
    "this observation is in agreement with earlier studies @xcite in which the inability of cdft to reproduce level crossing was already noted .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the singlet remains the ground state , the agreement between cldft and ed results is remarkable , even if this small ring is rather far from being a good approximation of the thermodynamic limit ( the ba solution ) upon which the functional has been constructed .    , for a 12-site ring at quarter filling ( @xmath100 ) obtained with both ed and cldft for different @xmath97 .",

    "the figure confirms the linearity of the persistent currents with the magnetic flux for all the interaction strengths considered .",
    "the same is also true for other fillings for the 12 site ring ( not presented here ) away from half - filling .",
    "we also observe that the magnitude of persistent currents reduces with increasing @xmath97 for both ed and cldft and that the precise dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath97 is different for different fillings .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous calculations based on the ba technique @xcite .",
    "ed is computationally demanding and can not be performed beyond a certain system size .",
    "for this reason , in order to benchmark cldft for larger rings , we have calculated the ground state energy with the ba method .",

    ". in particular table  [ thetable ] summarizes our results and demonstrates that the decay rate of both the persistent currents and the drude weights increases as the filling approaches half - filling .",
    "furthermore the table also quantifies the differences between the ba and the cldft solutions , whose exponents increasingly differ from each other as the electron filling gets closer to @xmath98 ( for @xmath125 we find @xmath141 ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , by combining all the results of this section we can propose a scaling law for both the persistent currents and the drude weights , valid in the metallic limit of the hubbard model , i.e. away from half - filling .",
    "this reads @xmath142 where both the constant @xmath143 and the exponent @xmath144 are function of the electron filling @xmath7 .",
    "note that an identical equation holds for @xmath126 .",
    "having established the success of the balda to cldft for the homogeneous case we now move to a more stringent test for the theory , namely the case of a ring penetrated by a magnetic flux in the presence of a single impurity .",
    "such a problem has already received considerable attention in the past @xcite .",
    "note that , as in _ ab initio _ dft , this is a situation different from the reference system used to construct the balda ( since it deals with a non homogeneous system ) and therefore one might expect a more pronounced disagreement with exact results . as the ba equations are integrable only for the homogeneous case we now benchmark our cldft results with those obtained by ed .",
    "this however limits our analysis to small rings .",
    "the single impurity in the ring is described by simply adding to the hamiltonian of equation ( [ hint ] ) the term @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the modification to the on - site energy at the impurity site @xmath147 .",
    "the inclusion of an impurity produces in general electron backscattering so that we expect the persistent currents to get reduced . in figure [ 53_26_persistent_vs_e1 ]",
    "we present the general transport features for this inhomogeneous system .",

    "as expected from standard scattering theory the current is reduced as @xmath146 increases , thus creating a potential barrier .",
    "the electron density profile for this situation is presented in panel ( b ) , where one can clearly observe an electron depletion at the impurity site and friedel s oscillations around it .    a quantitative assessment of our cldft results is provided in fig .",
    "[ bavscldft ] where they are compared with those obtained by exact diagonalization for a 13 site ring close to quarter filling ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "in particular we present @xmath82 as a function of the impurity potential , @xmath146 , for both @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in general",
    "we find a rather satisfactory agreement between cldft and the exact results in particular for small @xmath146 and @xmath97 . as",
    "the electron scattering becomes more significant deviations appear and the quantitative agreement is less good .",
    "importantly we notice that the ed results systematically provide a persistent current lower than that calculated with cldft , at least for the values of electron filling investigated here .",
    "this seems to be a consistent trend also present for the homogeneous case ( see figure  [ pcanddw ] ) , although the deviations in that case are less pronounced ( for the same electron filling and interaction strength ) .",
    "therefore we tentatively conclude that most of the errors in the impurity problem have to be attributed to the errors already present in the homogeneous case .",
    "we then expect that cldft provides a good platform for investigating scattering problems at only minor computational costs . as such cldft appears as the ideal tool for investigating the interplay between electron - electron interaction and disorder in low dimensional structures .    .",

    "in this work we have presented an extension of the balda for the one - dimensional hubbard problem on a ring to cldft .",
    "we have then investigated the response of interacting rings to an external flux both in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous case , and we have compared our results with those obtained by numerically exact techniques .",
    "our analysis has been confined to the metallic limit , i.e. away from half - filling , where the hubbard model has a metal to insulator transition . in general",
    "we have found that cldft performs rather well in calculating both the persistent currents and the drude weights in the homogeneous case .",
    "furthermore a similar level of accuracy is transferred to the impurity problem . with these results in hands",
    "we propose to use cldft in the study of ab rings where the combined effect of electron - electron interaction and disorder can be addressed for large rings , so that a numerical evaluation of the various scaling laws proposed in the past can be accurately carried out .",

    "then the phase variable @xmath81 can be eliminated from the ground state energy to contain the current via @xmath83    the complete flux dependence of the ground state energy for the mott insulator phase ( @xmath98 ) in the thermodynamic limit has been shown to be @xcite @xmath153 while away from half filling and @xmath129 this is @xmath154 here @xmath155 is the charge stiffness ( drude weight ) defined as @xmath156 in physical terms the drude weight @xmath126 is the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath157 in the long wavelength limit @xcite , @xmath158 where we took @xmath159 .",
