    "current theoretical stellar models are increasingly sophisticated and accurate , and different sets of models often produce very similar predictions for the physical parameters of stars .",
    "this is particularly pronounced on the main sequence , where evolution is slow and agreement between models is very good ( pols  1997 ) .",
    "observational tests of stellar models therefore require high - quality data and careful treatment to allow a discriminating test of the success of a particular set of physical ingredients compared to other evolutionary models ( andersen 1991 ) .",
    "this is exacerbated by the number of physical parameters which are not observed or well known , so several quantities can be freely adjusted when attempting to fit observed data , e.g. , the abundances of helium and metals , the degree of convective overshooting ( young  2001 ) and indeed the type of convective theory .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) have often been used for testing theoretical models .",
    "the combination of a double - lined spectroscopic orbit and the fitting of a simple geometrical model to an observed light curve allows the derivation of accurate masses , radii , and radiative properties of the two stars ( andersen 1991 ) .",
    "the component stars are expected to have the same age and chemical composition , but models can still be chosen of any age and composition ( within reason ) to fit the observed stellar parameters .",
    "photometric studies of open clusters are a very common method of testing the predictions of stellar models ( e.g. , daniel  1994 ) .",
    "this method has the potential to test subtle effects and might require little telescope time , but it can be limited in its usefulness due to degeneracies between the distance to the cluster , its age , metallicity and reddening effects ( including differential reddening over the cluster ) .",
    "it can also be difficult to identify unresolved binary stars and field stars , which can affect the reliability of the conclusions ( nordstrm , andersen & andersen 1997 ) .",
    "a further problem is the need to convert observed quantities to theoretical values to properly compare observations to stellar models .",

    "the timescales of rotational synchronisation for these two debs are @xmath25500myr and @xmath2525myr for v615per and v618per respectively ( zahn 1977 , hilditch 2001 ) . for v618per",
    "this timescale is of the same order of magnitude as the cluster age so it is to be expected that the component stars have had their rotational evolution affected by their membership of a close binary system .",
    "for v615per , however , the timescale is much greater so the rotational velocities of the stars will not have changed significantly during their main sequence lifetime . therefore their slow rotation must be primordial in nature ( see valtonen 1998 ) .",
    "the timescales of orbital circularisation for the two debs are @xmath251200gyr and @xmath2521gyr for v615per and v618per respectively ( zahn 1977 , hilditch 2001 ) so it is expected that these young systems will have undergone no orbital evolution during their main sequence lifetimes . both debs exhibit negligible eccentricity and their closeness to circularisation must again be primordial ( zahn & bouchet 1989 ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the four stars in v615per and v618per have been compared to two different sets of stellar models , the granada models ( claret 1995 , 1997 ; claret & gimnez 1995 , 1998 ) and the padova models ( girardi  2000 ) .",
    "the granada models are available for four metallicities , each with three different hydrogen abundances : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "we have derived absolute dimensions for two early - type detached eclipsing binaries in the young open cluster hper .",
    "spectral synthesis has given the effective temperatures and rotational velocities of both systems .",
    "the negligibly eccentric orbits and low rotational velocities of all four stars supports the ` delayed break - up ' route of binary star formation ( tohline 2002 ) . in this scenario a protostellar core embedded in a molecular cloud contracts towards the zams .",
    "it accretes material with a high specific angular momentum from the surrounding cloud , and spins up whilst losing gravitational potential energy . when the ratio of rotational energy to the absolute value of gravitational energy , @xmath40 , reaches approximately 0.27 ( lebovitz 1974 , 1984 ) , the core deforms into an ellipsoidal shape . from this",
    "it forms a ` dumbbell ' shape which splits to form a binary system with a circular orbit and low stellar rotational velocities .",
    "other examples exist of young long - period spectroscopic binaries with circular orbits , e.g. , # 363 in ngc3532 ( gonzlez & lapasset 2002 ) .",
    "the four stars exhibit a good spread of masses and radii which should provide an excellent test of stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the radii could not be determined from the current light curves with great accuracy , so the analysis has been restricted to a determination of the bulk metallicity of the hper cluster of @xmath16 .",
    "the existence of galactic disc low - metallicity young bstars is already known ( e.g. , gglupi ; andersen , clausen & gimnez 1993 ) .",
    "the chemical composition of h and @xmath41 per has been investigated many times with somewhat conflicting results .",
    "nissen ( 1976 ) found the helium abundance of hper to be significantly lower than that of field stars , based on narrow - band photometry of twelve zams and slightly evolved bstars .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the spectroscopic observations of wolff & heasley ( 1985 ) . however , from high - resolution spectroscopic abundance analyses of four stars , lennon , brown & dufton ( 1988 ) and dufton  ( 1990 ) found that helium abundance was normal and suggested that the surface gravities derived by nissen ( 1976 ) were too low .",
    "dufton  also found that h and @xmath41 per have approximately solar metal abundances .",
    "this conclusion was supported by smartt & rolleston ( 1997 ) , but vrancken  ( 2000 ) find that the abundances of various metals are 0.30.5dex below solar from abundance analyses of eight early btype giants .",
    "the above results refer to empirical determinations of the mean photospheric abundances of helium and several light metals .",
    "our derivation of the cluster metallicity , @xmath16 , has been found by comparison with theoretical stellar evolutionary models and refers to the overall metal abundance in the interiors of the stars analysed .",
    "this quantity is directly relevant to the fitting of theoretical isochrones to the positions of stars in observed cmds of the h and @xmath41 per open clusters .",
    "the four recent photometric studies of h and @xmath41 persei have not included the effects of non - solar metallicity in their analyses ; whilst marco & bernabeu ( 2001 ) and slesnick  ( 2002 ) assumed a metallicity of @xmath30 , the works of capilla & fabregat ( 2002 ) and keller  ( 2001 ) make no mention of metallicity . if all analyses used a solar metallicity , the derived age and distance modulus of h and @xmath41 per could be systematically incorrect .",
    "this possibility also is increased by the dependence on one set of model isochrones ; three of the four works used the stellar models of the geneva group ( schaller  1992 ) , although keller  used the previous generation of padova models ( bressan  1993 ; bertelli  1994 ) .",
    "once more accurate radii for the four stars studied here are obtained , a reanalysis of h and @xmath41 persei should be undertaken to ensure that reliable parameters are known .",
    "the four recent photometric analyses suggest the age of the cluster is @xmath42 ( see section  [ clusterinfo ] ) and the positions of the stars of v615per and v618per in the mass  radius plane are consistent with this .",
    "the traditional degeneracy between age , metal abundance and helium abundance ( thompson  2001 ) could be broken with better light curves for the two debs . in that case",
    "the large range of masses of the four stars would allow the less massive stars to set the metallicity and the more massive stars to set the age of the cluster , with information on the helium abundance contained in the slope of the observational line in the mass  radius plane .",
    "such an analysis would benefit from better sampled grids of stellar models and a greater choice of helium abundance and degree of overshooting ( see also young  2001 ) .",
    "definitive light curves of the debs should give radii to 12% and the individual brightnesses of the component stars in the observed filters .",
    "this will allow more discriminate testing of stellar evolutionary models and the construction of a cluster hr diagram with mass and radius determinations for four individual stars . if the light curves are observed in the strmgren @xmath43 or the broad - band @xmath44 filters , the surface brightnesses of the stars could be accurately derived ( moon 1984 , dibenedetto 1998 , lacy 1978 , barnes , evans & parsons 1976 ) . when combined with the radius determinations of the stars , the distances of each star could be found individually , giving four separate measures of the distance to hper , independent of stellar models and main sequence fitting .",
    "the richness of h and @xmath41 per suggests there may be undiscovered eclipsing systems which could be added to this analysis .",
    "v621per is a member of @xmath41per with a spectral type of b2iii and is known to be a deb ( krzesnski & pigulski , 1997 ) .",
    "it is a spectroscopic binary but spectra taken during our int observing run show no sign of a fainter component , making it impossible to find the absolute masses and radii of its component stars in the usual way .",
