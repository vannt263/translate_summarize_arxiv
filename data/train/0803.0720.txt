    "the explicit description of the stable category of maximal cohen - macaulay modules over a commutative gorenstein ring ( also known as the singularity category @xcite ) is a problem that has received much attention over the years .",

    "our first approach applies to example [ ref-1.2 - 1 ] and is inspired by the treatment in @xcite of example [ ref-1.1 - 0 ] where the authors used the fact that in this case the stable category @xmath15 of maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath14-modules is a @xmath16-calabi - yau category which has a cluster tilting object whose endomorphism ring is the path algebra @xmath17 of the kronecker quiver with @xmath18 arrows . then they invoke their acyclicity result ( slightly specialized ) :    ( * ? ? ?",

    "the quotient @xmath39 has to be understood as the triangulated / karoubian hull ( as explained in @xcite ) of the naive quotient of @xmath35 by the shift functor @xmath40 .",
    "this result is similar in spirit to @xcite which treats the finite representation type case .",
    "note however that one of the main results in loc .",
    "is that in case of finite representation type case _ every _ indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath41-module is gradable .",
    "this does not seem to be a formal consequence of proposition [ ref-1.4 - 3 ] .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this further .    in  [",

    "we expect this to be well known in some form but we have been unable to locate a reference .    hence in order to understand @xmath43 it is sufficient to understand @xmath42 .",
    "the latter is the graded singularity category @xcite of @xmath33 and by ( * ? ? ? * thm 2.5 ) it is related to @xmath44 where @xmath45 .    in examples [ ref-1.1 - 0],[ref-1.2 - 1 ]",
    "@xmath14 is the completion of a graded ring @xmath33 which is the veronese of a polynomial ring .",
    "hence @xmath46 is simply a projective space . using orlov s results and the existence of exceptional collections on projective space we get very quickly in example [ ref-1.1 - 0 ] @xmath47 and in example [ ref-1.2 - 1 ] @xmath48 ( where here and below @xmath49 actually stands for a quasi - equivalence between the underlying dg - categories ) .",

    "finally we mention the following interesting side result    [ ref-1.5 - 5 ] [ ref-1.5 - 6 ] let @xmath52 be a gorenstein local `` g - ring '' for example @xmath14 may be essentially of finite type over a field with an isolated singularity . then the natural functor @xmath53 is an equivalence up to direct summands . in partular",
    "every maximal cohen - macaulay module over @xmath54 is a direct summand of the completion of a maximal cohen - macaulay module over @xmath14 .",
    "the original proof ( by the first and the third author ) of this result was unnecessarily complicated . after the paper was put on the arxiv daniel murfet ( who has become the second author ) informed us about the existence of a much nicer proof in the context of singularity categories ( see proposition [ theorem : first_theorem ] ) .",
    "the same argument also applies to proposition [ ref-1.4 - 3 ] .",
    "so we dropped our original proofs and put the new argument in an appendix to which we refer .",
