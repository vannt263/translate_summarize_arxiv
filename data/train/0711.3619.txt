    "over the last several years the torsional oscillator ( to ) technique has become a popular method @xcite to study solid @xmath0he .",
    "the measurements , which involve monitoring the resonant frequency _ f _ of a high quality factor torsion pendulum filled with @xmath0he , have revealed a `` transition '' below an onset temperature _ t@xmath2 _ of @xmath1200 mk .",
    "the results of several control experiments @xcite indicate that the sudden increase in the frequency is due to a superfluid - like decoupling of a fraction of the @xmath0he mass .",
    "the apparent nonclassical rotational inertia fraction ( ncrif ) , proportional to the frequency shift @xmath3__f _ _ , is independent @xcite of the maximum oscillation speed _ _ v__@xmath4 of the to provided that it is smaller than a critical value . above this critical velocity _ v@xmath5 _ the magnitude of ncrif is attenuated . the value of _",
    "v@xmath5 _ corresponds to several quanta of circulation @xmath6 , suggesting that the important excitations in the system are vortices .",
    "anderson has proposed @xcite a vortex liquid model that qualitatively captures a number of experimental results .    in multiple solid @xmath0he samples slowly grown within an annulus of radius , _ r _ = 5 mm , and width @xcite , _ t _ = 0.95 mm , a value of _ v@xmath5 _",
    "= 10 @xmath7m@xmath8s@xmath9 was found @xcite ( corresponding to @xmath6 = 2@xmath10__rv__@xmath4 @xmath11 3__h__/_m _ , where _ h _ is planck s constant and _",
    "m _ is the bare @xmath0he mass ) .",
    "ncrif decreased almost linearly with ln[__v__@xmath4 ] as the speed was increased further .",
    "this attenuation , according to ref .  , is attributable to the nonlinear susceptibility of a vortex liquid phase , which consists of an entanglement of many thermally activated vortices @xcite . the ability of the vortices to move counter to the time - dependent superflow ( relative to the cell s oscillation ) results in the screening of supercurrents . as the temperature is lowered the motion and number of vortices",
    "is reduced so that ncrif becomes finite .",
    "the accompanying dissipation @xcite that peaks in the middle of the transition is due to a matching of _ f _ and the optimal rate at which vortices respond to changes in the velocity field .",
    "residual @xmath13he atoms may @xcite cling to vortices , thereby slowing vortex motion and ultimately enhancing the onset temperature @xcite .",
    "one prediction of anderson s model @xcite is that _ t@xmath2 _ , and perhaps ncrif , for a particular sample will decrease as the measurement frequency is lowered .",
    "performed @xcite measurements in a double oscillator that operated in either an antisymmetric ( high _ f _ ) or a symmetric ( low _ f _ ) mode and found that for the same @xmath0he sample , _",
    "t@xmath2 _ @xmath11 240 mk at 1173 hz and _ t@xmath2 _ @xmath11 160 mk at 496 hz . however , ncrif became independent of frequency below @xmath135 mk .",
    "in addition , irreversible changes in ncrif below @xmath145 mk occurred upon variation of the oscillation speed between 10 @xmath7m@xmath8s@xmath9 and 800 @xmath7m@xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "nonsuperfluid explanations of the to experiments have also been proposed , in which some sort of freezing process @xcite or glass transition @xcite takes place .",
    "although the former was only discussed qualitatively , the pinning of dislocation lines within solid @xmath0he is one possible realization of such a `` freezing '' transition .",
    "the mechanism for dislocation pinning is likely related to interactions with isotopic impurities .",
    "it is known that dislocations @xcite and @xmath13he atoms @xcite are mobile in solid @xmath0he below @xmath11 k , but the strong coupling between them in the low temperature limit can immobilize them both @xcite . in a to study @xcite of many solid @xmath0he samples we found that the dependence of _ t@xmath2 _ on the @xmath13he concentration _ _",
    "x__@xmath14 is quantitatively consistent with this impurity - pinning model .",
    "recently day and beamish observed @xcite a dramatic increase ( between 5% and 20% ) in the shear modulus _ _ c__@xmath15 of solid @xmath0he ( _ _ x__@xmath14 @xmath11 0.3 ppm ) below @xmath1250 mk , with the temperature dependence of _ _ c__@xmath15 strongly resembling that of _ f _ in to experiments .",
    "the authors also reported hysteresis in _ _ c__@xmath15 upon adjusting the stress amplitude of the measurement at _ t _ @xmath11 20 mk , similar to what is seen in ref .  .",
    "the increase in the shear modulus is very likely due to the stiffening of the dislocation network via the immobilization of individual lines .",
    "it was suggested by the authors of ref .   that an increase in _",
    "_ c__@xmath15 will result in a stronger coupling between the @xmath0he sample and its container and therefore mimic an enhanced mass loading of a to , causing _",
    "f _ to decrease .",
    "however , any enhancement to the overall rigidity of the system actually leads to a higher resonant frequency .",
    "we have carried out a finite element method ( fem ) calculation @xcite employing realistic parameters of the to and solid helium in order to confirm this result .",
    "the positive correlation between _ _ c__@xmath15 and _ f _ , their resemblances in the temperature dependence , and the hysteresis common to both , all suggest that either the frequency shift is a direct consequence of the enhanced modulus and can be explained without invoking supersolidity or that the microscopic mechanism responsible for ncri also affects the elastic properties of the solid ( e.g. , a recent suggestion is given in ref .  ) . the results presented below appear to favor the latter .",

    "using the following protocol , the thermal history of @xmath3__f@xmath20 _ _ was investigated in crystals grown under different conditions .",

    "it is also likely that vortices are more easily excited as _ t@xmath2 _ is approached .    the velocity dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] reflects the distribution in the strength of individual vortex pinning sites at low temperature .",
    "annealing might effectively remove the weakest pinning centers so that the low temperature limiting value of ncrif is only decreased at small _ _ v__@xmath4 . at greater speeds these weak regions are irrelevant since there is a plethora of free vortices , hence the convergence in figs .",

    "the low temperature metastability seems to depend on the difference between the initial ncrif prepared at low speed and the `` equilibrium '' value obtained upon cooling at the higher speed .",

    "since the low temperature change in the resonant frequency is very small ( parts per million ) , it scales linearly with the change in the shear modulus . as a result the inferred temperature dependence of @xmath3__c__@xmath15/__c__@xmath15 is identical to @xmath3__f@xmath20__.",
    "it is therefore natural that the qualitative features of the data in ref .",
    "be very similar to that from to studies .    however , the magnitude of the relative change in _ _",
    "c__@xmath15 appears to be different . in order to account for the observed @xmath3__f@xmath20 _ _ in to measurements the required @xmath3__c__@xmath15/__c__@xmath15 values among the samples studied are between two and five times larger than those seen in ref .  .",
    "moreover , the changes are greater than the theoretical upper limit of 30% that can result from the pinning of dislocation lines @xcite .",
    "we have carried out similar calculations for some of the to s in the literature @xcite and found that even larger values of @xmath3__c__@xmath15/__c__@xmath15 are necessary to account for the observed @xmath3__f@xmath20__. for instance , typical ncrif values in refs .",

    "_ c__@xmath15 to increase by factors of 5 and 10 in the anti - symmetric and symmetric modes , respectively .",
    "this implies that the effect is very dependent on frequency , contrary to the findings of day and beamish .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to apply the dislocation pinning picture to the experiments in porous vycor glass @xcite , in which the dimensions of helium ( i.e. , the pore size ) are smaller than typical dislocation loop lengths in bulk crystals @xcite .",
    "this , and the fact that the crystalline phase @xcite of the confined @xmath0he is body - centered - cubic rather than hexagonal - close - packed , would lead one to expect very different behavior in the response to torsional oscillations , counter to what is observed .    day and beamish found the measured shear modulus to be a function of stress amplitude . below a critical stress @xmath19__@xmath5 _ _ the magnitude of _ _ c__@xmath15 saturates at a maximum value , as does @xmath3__f@xmath20 _ _ in some samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) .",

    "such strong nonlinearity between the drive and response , also seen in other low frequency acoustic measurements @xcite , occurs at `` critical '' speeds that are 100 to 1000 times less ( e.g. , @xmath150 nm@xmath8s@xmath9 in ref .  )",
    "than in to studies @xcite .",
    "it was concluded in ref .",
    "that @xmath19__@xmath5 _ _ is a more fundamental quantity than _",
    "v@xmath5 _ due to it being independent of the measurement frequency .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with ref .   and",
    "implies that the two types of measurements , although clearly related on some level , are distinct .",
    "we have studied a number of solid @xmath0he samples grown within a torsional oscillator at constant temperature and pressure , as well as with the blocked capillary method , and found that the resonant frequency of the system possesses a very strong thermal history .",
    "the magnitude of the apparent ncrif measured in the low temperature limit is reproducible when obtained upon cooling the sample from temperatures well above the transition .",
    "modulation of the oscillation speed below the onset temperature reveals the existence of many metastable states .",
    "we find that these properties are qualitatively consistent with two different interpretations : the response of vortices to velocity fields and/or the response of dislocation lines within the solid to oscillating stress fields .",
    "the mobility of either of these entities becomes very limited with decreasing temperature , resulting in hysteretic behavior below 60 mk .",
    "extreme pinning takes place below 30 mk ( 1 ppb ) or 45 mk ( 0.3 ppm ) , such that their motion is essentially frozen out .    at present there",
    "remain discrepancies between the experiments and either of the two interpretations . in the vortex liquid picture ,",
    "the most notable problem is the very low critical velocity found in this study . in regard to the elastic properties of solid @xmath0he",
