    "in this paper we apply the relativistic coupled - cluster single - double ( sd ) approximation to calculate positron binding energies for a number of atoms , including open - shell transition metal atoms .",
    "positron - atom bound states are characterized by strong electron - positron correlation effects .",
    "these effects for the positron bound states are even stronger than for their electron counterparts , i.e. , the atomic negative ions .",
    "this is due to the electron - positron _ attraction _ and , in particular , the large role of virtual positronium ( ps ) formation  @xcite .",
    "this makes calculations of positron - atom bound states a challenging theoretical problem .",
    "using the sd method allows us to include all the main correlation effects for atoms with several electrons in the open valence shell , which has not been done before .",
    "the existence of positron - atom bound states was predicted by many - body theory calculations  @xcite and verified variationally  @xcite more than a decade ago .",
    "since then positron binding energies have been calculated for many ground - state and excited atoms : he  @xmath0s , li , be , be  @xmath0p , na , mg , ca , cu , zn , sr , ag , cd and hg ( see , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are strong indications that many more atoms , possibly over a quarter of the whole periodic table , should be able to bind positrons  @xcite . such conclusions are based on the analysis of the atomic ionization potentials and dipole polarizabilities , which are relevant for positron binding , and on the calculations of positron binding to a `` model alkali atom '' @xcite ( see also review on positron compounds @xcite ) . in spite of this wealth of predictions , experimental verification of positron binding to neutral atoms is still lacking .",
    "recently we proposed ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that positron binding to many open - shell atoms could be studied experimentally by measuring resonant positron - atom annihilation .",
    "such resonant annihilation should be similar to that observed for positrons in many polyatomic molecular species @xcite . in this process",
    "the incident positron is captured into the bound state with the target , with the excess energy being transferred ( in the case of molecules ) to vibrations .",
    "since the vibrational motion of the molecules is quantized , these transitions can only take place at specific positron energies , which means that they have a _ resonant _ character .",
    "these energies correspond to vibrational feshbach resonances of the positron - molecule complex @xcite .",
    "the majority of the resonances observed are associated with individual vibrational modes of the molecule .",
    "the negative energy of the positron bound state @xmath1 is then related the downshift of the resonance energy , @xmath2 with respect to the energy @xmath3 of the vibrational excitation @xcite .",
    "hence , by observing the resonances , the positron binding energy @xmath4 can be found . in this way",
    "binding energies for over sixty polyatomic species have been determined @xcite by measuring positron annihilation using a high - resolution , tunable , trap - based positron beam @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we suggested that one can search for a similar effect in atoms . in this case",
    "the resonances will be associated with low - lying electronic excitations .",
    "these can be found in open - shell atoms , where they often have the same configuration as the ground state .",
    "if the positron can bind to such an atom in the ground state , then it is likely to bind to its excited state as well .",
    "one can then consider the following process , @xmath5 here the positron first loses energy by exciting the atom and becoming trapped in the bound state with the excited atom .",
    "it then annihilates with one of the electrons , and the resulting gamma quanta can be detected .",
    "the first step of the process ( [ eq : ae+ ] ) is obviously reversible .",
    "hence , to estimate the efficiency of resonant annihilation one needs to evaluate the rates of both positron annihilation and autodetachment  @xcite .    to prove",
    "the feasibility of such process one also needs to estimate the positron binding energies to open - shell atoms . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used a simple approach in which the second - order correlation potential of the positron - atom interaction was scaled up to account for the effect of higher - order electron - positron correlations ( i.e. , virtual ps formation ) .",
    "it was assumed that the scaling factor is the same for all atoms , and its value was chosen by fitting the results for those atoms where accurate positron binding calculations are available .",
    "open shells were treated by using fractional occupation numbers in the standard expressions for a closed - shell system .",
    "this approximation looks reasonable in the positron - atom problem , because the positron is not affected by the pauli principle .",
    "the positron - atom interaction has , thus , no direct sensitivity to the valence shell being open or closed ( unlike the electron - atom interaction in the negative ion problem ) .    in the present paper",
    "we use a more sophisticated fully _ ab initio _ approach in which the strong electron - positron correlations are included explicitly through the use of an all - order technique .",
    "accurate treatment of the strong electron - positron correlations is the main challenge in the calculations of positron - atom interaction .",
    "it calls for the use of nonperturbative approaches . for systems with few active electrons accurate results",
    "were obtained using stochastic variation method @xcite .",
    "the most obvious choice for a generic many - electron atom is the configuration interaction ( ci ) technique .",
    "it was successfully employed in a number of previous calculations for atoms with one or two electrons in the valence @xmath6 shell ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it becomes too complicated for more than two valence electrons and , in particular , for atoms with open @xmath7-shells , which we want to consider in present work .",
    "another suitable all - order technique is the couple - cluster approach . in this approach",
    "the interparticle interaction is included to all orders via an iterative procedure .",
    "the corresponding subset of terms includes the so - called _ ladder _ diagrams  @xcite .",
    "this class of diagrams is very important in the positron - atom problem , as it describes the effect of virtual ps formation .",
    "summation of the electron - positron ladder - diagram series was performed earlier by solving a linear matrix equation for the electron - positron vertex function for hydrogen @xcite , noble - gas atoms  @xcite , and halogen negative ions  @xcite .",
    "the coupled - cluster approach in its single - double ( sd ) approximation has been widely used for atoms and ions with one external electron above closed shells ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to modify the corresponding equations for the case of a positron interacting with a closed - shell atom .",
    "we will do this in the next section .    to test the method",
    "we first apply it to positron binding to closed - shell atoms : be , mg , ca , zn , cd , and hg for which a number of accurate calculations is available .",
    "we then apply the same approach to open - shell atoms , treating them in a simplified manner similar to that of ref .",
    "fractional occupation numbers are used to rescale the terms containing contributions from the open shells .",
    "the main advance of the present method compared with ref .",
    "@xcite is the all - order treatment of the positron - electron interaction in the correlation potential .",
    "no further fitting is used or needed . remarkably , the results of the all - order calculations turn out to be close to the estimates obtained in our previous work .",
    "these calculations lend further support to the proposal to search for positron - bound states with open - shell atoms through resonant annihilation or scattering .",
    "the use of the coupled cluster technique requires construction of a single - particle basis . for a positron interacting with an atom one must have two separate basis sets ",
    "one for electron states and one for positron states .",
    "we use a standard b - spline technique in both cases  @xcite .",
    "the electron basis states are constructed by diagonalizing the matrix of the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) hamiltonian in the b - spline basis .",
    "the positron basis states are constructed using the same set of b - splines and the rhf hamiltonian in which the sign of the direct potential is changed and the exchange potential is omitted . below we will use the following notation for the basis states : indices @xmath8 refer to electron states in the core , indices @xmath9 refer to electron states above the core , indices @xmath10 refer to positron states , and indices @xmath11 refer to any states .",
    "numerical results reported in secs .",

    "( [ eq : psiv ] ) represent single- and double - electron excitations from the core .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 represent excitations of the positron , and the coefficients @xmath21 represent simultaneous excitatons of the positron and one of the electrons .    the sd equations for the core excitation coefficients do not depend on the external particle and are the same in the electron and positron cases .",
    "they are written as a set of equations for the single - excitation coefficients @xmath22 and double - excitation coefficients @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in these equation @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the coefficients @xmath27 are the coulomb integrals , @xmath28 involving electron states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    "the core sd equations ( [ eq : core1 ] ) and ( [ eq : core2 ] ) are solved iteratively until convergence is achieved .",
    "this is controlled by the correlation correction to the energy of the core , @xmath31    after solving the sd equations for the core one can start iterating the sd equations for the external particle .",
    "the sd equations for the positron can be obtained by substituting the state @xmath32 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiv ] ) into the relativistic many - body schrdinger equation , @xmath33 projecting the schrdinger equation onto @xmath34 gives the equation for @xmath35 , @xmath36 projecting eq .",

    "[ f : sd1 ] and [ f : sdp ] .",
    "when solving these equations , the correction to the energy of the positron state @xmath13 , @xmath41 is used to control convergence .",
    "apart from the absence of the exchange terms involving the positron , there is another important difference between the sd equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) for the positron and those for external electrons in atoms or ions . in the latter cases the sd equation for the double - excitation coefficient",
    "also contains a term @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding diagram is `` reducible '' , i.e. , it contains two parts connected by the single line of the excited valence particle . including it ensures that the correction to the energy of the valence state @xmath13 is determined in all orders .",
    "when using the sd method for the positron , its eigenstate and energy eigenvalue @xmath1 are obtained by matrix diagonalization ( see below ) .",
    "the need for this procedure arises because of the absence of a good zeroth - order approximation for the wave function of the bound positron . in the rhf approximation",
    "the positron - atom interaction is repulsive , and all of the single - particle positron basis states lie in the continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the b - spline basis is effectively complete for the positron bound state to be obtained by matrix diagonalization .",
    "to do this , the sd equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) should be iterated for every positron basis state used to construct effective single - particle hamiltonian matrix .",
    "a similar situation occurs for negative ions  @xcite and when combining the sd method with the configuration interaction technique to obtain many - electron wave functions  @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "the term @xmath42 should be removed from the sd equations , as it is taken into account via matrix diagonalization .",
    "the wavefunction of the bound positron is found as an expansion over the positron basis states , @xmath43 equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) are iterated for every basis state @xmath13 in the expansion ( [ eq : psip ] ) .",
    "the energy parameter @xmath44 in these equations is the ( unknown ) energy of the positron state ( [ eq : psip ] ) .",
    "the energy @xmath44 and the expansion coefficients @xmath45 are found by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vector of expansion coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath1 is the lowest eigenvalue ( which must be negative ) , and the elements of the effective hamiltonian matrix @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 the first term on the righ - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) represents the positron energies in the static rhf approximation .",
    "the second and third terms describe the effect of electron - positron correlations .",
    "these two terms are the positron - atom _ self - energy _ , which is given by right - hand side of the diagrammatic equation in fig .",
    "[ f : sd1 ] .    since the sd equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) depend on the energy @xmath44 which is found later from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sx ] ) , we start with an initial guess for @xmath44 .",
    "the calculations are then performed iteratively , solving the sd equations ( [ eq : v1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2 ] ) and diagonalizing the matrix ( [ eq : sigma ] ) several times until @xmath1 has converged . in practice",
    "this takes about 5 global iterations .",
    "the sd equations account for the second - order contribution and selected classes of higher - order correlation diagrams in all orders . in particular , the electron - positron ladder diagram series , which describes virtual ps formation , is included in full .",
    "however , beginning with the third order , the sd approximation misses certain terms .",
    "it is well known that the missing third - order terms can give sizeable corrections to the energy in atomic systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . including these terms can lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of the results , and we include these contributions for the positron bound states with atoms .",
    "the third - order terms not included in the sd approximation are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of electron interacting with a closed - shell ion .",
    "similar terms for the positron case can be obtained by changing the sign of coulomb integrals involving the positron and removing exchange .",
    "all resulting third - order diagrams are shown in fig .",

    "the corresponding perturbation - theory corrections to the energy of the positron state @xmath50 are @xmath51 here @xmath52 , @xmath44 is the positron energy found by solving the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : sx ] ) , and the positron state @xmath50 is given by eq .",

    "such systems are easiest from the computational point of view .",
    "there are also a number of other calculations of positron binding of different level of sophistication for several such atoms .",
