    "in cellular automata , the discrete states of the cells in a regular grid are updated in time according to a local rule  that is , the new state of a cell depends only on its old state and the old state of a finite neighborhood around it .",
    "the same rule applies to all cells .",
    "the locality and uniformity of this procedure give ca s a `` physics - like '' quality , which is why ca s have attracted much attention as simplified discrete simulations of physical systems  or in a more speculative vein , as models of the fundamental physical laws themselves @xcite .    a cellular automaton rule",
    "is said to be _",
    "invertible _ ( or _ reversible _ ) if it maps configurations of a ( finite or infinite ) grid to new configurations in a 1 - 1 way @xcite .",
    "the earlier state of the grid can be uniquely determined from the later state .",
    "invertible ca s thus capture a further principle of physics : the microscopic reversibility of the dynamical laws of an isolated system .",
    "invertible ca models have been used to study reversible computation and to simulate hydrodynamic and magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the definition of ca invertibility is a global one , but a theorem of richardson @xcite guarantees that it has a local meaning .",
    "if a ca rule @xmath0 yields an invertible map on global grid configurations , then the inverse map is always given by another ca rule @xmath1 , possibly with a much larger neighborhood than @xmath0 .",
    "it can be quite difficult to tell whether a given ca rule is invertible  that is , whether any such @xmath1 exists .",
    "in fact , in grids of more than one dimension , there is no effective computational procedure for deciding whether a rule is invertible in every case @xcite . from the model - builder s perspective , however , it is more important to devise techniques for _ constructing _ ca s that are guaranteed to be invertible .",
    "we have identified three general approaches that are used to construct invertible ca rules .    *",
    "the first is the _ partitioning rule _",
    "the grid is partitioned uniformly into finite blocks , and the configuration of each block is updated according to some map that is both 1 - 1 and onto . since there are only a finite number of states for each block , it is easy to confirm that a given update map is invertible . at the next step ,",
    "the block partition is shifted according to a predetermined rule , and the process is repeated .",
    "+ to visualize this , consider a 1-d grid of cells , each of which has @xmath2 possible states .",
    "we partition the grid into blocks of length 2 , so that each block contains an even - odd pair of cells ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "each 2-cell block is updated according to some 1 - 1 and onto map @xmath4 of the @xmath5 possible block states . in the next time step , we partition the grid into odd - even blocks ( @xmath6 ) and apply the same update rule @xmath7 to these .",
    "further steps repeat this alternation , as shown in figure  [ fig - partitioning ] .",
    "+ , height=192 ] + this is plainly an invertible ca , since the inverse block map @xmath8 exists and we can apply it to the reverse sequence of partitions . *",
    "the second method of constructing invertible ca rules is the _ second - order rule _ approach .",
    "this is easiest to understand in the context of a binary ca with cell states 0 and 1 ( though it can be generalized to any number of cell states ) . at any given time @xmath9 , we consider the present state @xmath10 of a cell , the states @xmath11 of its neighbors , and the previous state @xmath12 of the cell",
    ". the rule is determined by choosing an arbitrary binary function @xmath13 of the cell and its neighbors .",
    "the update rule is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents addition modulo 2 .",
    "+ this is called a `` second - order '' rule because the new cell state depends on cell states of two successive times .",
    "any such rule is invertible  indeed , its inverse is the same rule provided the time steps are reversed .",
    "that is , @xmath16 as is easily seen . * the third way to build an invertible ca is to use use the _ alternating - subgrid _ approach .",
    "consider a 2-d square grid of cells , and imagine that the cells are alternately colored black and white in the manner of a checkerboard .",
    "( this coloring is a kind of background _ texture _ that exists independently of the cell states . )",
    "the neighborhood of a cell contains only itself and the cells immediately adjacent to it .",
    "thus , the neighborhood of a black cells consists of itself and four white neighbors , and _",
    "vice versa_. + the trick is now to update black and white cells in alternate time steps .",
    "if @xmath9 is even only the black cells are updated , and if @xmath9 is odd only the white cells are updated . thus , no cell is updated in the same step as its neighbors . if the cell updates according to @xmath17 we know that the the states @xmath18 of the four neighbors ( north , east , south , west ) are not updated at the same time .",
    "+ this by itself is not enough to guarantee invertiblity . to do this",
    ", we need to require that , for any neighbor configuration @xmath18 , the function @xmath4 is 1 - 1 and onto on the set of states @xmath19 . since the states are drawn from a finite set , it suffices to require that @xmath20 implies @xmath21 for any given choice of @xmath18 . given this condition",
    ", there is another function @xmath22 of the neighborhood that reverses the action of @xmath4 on each updating cell .",
    "the inverse of the alternating - subgrid ca is just another alternating - subgrid ca using @xmath22 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of constructing invertible ca rules is the problem of conserving information .",
    "the value of the cell state @xmath10 at time @xmath9 constitutes information , and it must always be possible to recover this information from the state of the grid at the next time @xmath23",
    ". this might be very complicated .",
    "the subsequent state @xmath24 of the same cell generally depends on the states of several cells ( the whole neighborhood ) at time @xmath9 , so it is usually not possible to reconstruct @xmath10 from @xmath24 alone .",
    "the information about @xmath10 is held jointly by many cells at the later time . but all of those cells have meanwhile been influenced by many other cells . to construct an invertible rule",
    ", we must somehow devise this local network of information exchange to globally preserve all of the cell state information over time .    the alternating - subgrid technique described above addresses this challenge in a very simple way . at any given step ,",
    "no cell is both updating its own state and influencing the states of its neighbors .",
    "that is , the cell is either listening to its neighbors ( and updating its state accordingly ) or talking to its neighbors ( and influencing their states ) , but never both .",
    "since the neighbors that influence a cell s new state retain their own states ( for that time step ) , they retain the necessary `` context '' information to reverse the cell update operation .",
    "see figure  [ fig - alternating ] .",
    ", height=144 ]    our approach is to generalize this basic idea , taking what we may call a _ transmitting - state _ appraoch . at any given time @xmath9",
    ", each particular cell may be in a `` transmitting '' or `` non - transmitting '' state",
    ". there may be several distinct states of each type . the update rule for a transmitting state does not depend at all on the cell s neighbors .",
    "the update rule for a non - transmitting state only depends on the cell s own value and that of its transmitting neighbors .",
    "that is , cells in transmitting states are not subject to outside influences , and those that are not transmitting are only influenced by transmitting neighbors .    in the sections that follow ,",
    "we make this intuitive idea rigorous and show how to use it to create an invertible cellular automaton rule .",
    "we briefly explore an example of a 3-state/1-d invertible rule of this type , and show that this rule conserves an additive `` energy '' quantity on the grid .",
    "( such conservative rules are useful for exploring thermodynamics in discrete systems . ) finally , we add some remarks and pose some unresolved questions .",
    "our cellular automata will exist on a regular grid in any number of dimensions .",
    "each cell has a finite set @xmath25 of states , and its neighborhood consists of itself and @xmath26 neighboring cells .",
    "the update rule is a function of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath19 is the cell state and @xmath28 is the state of the @xmath29 neighbor cell .",
    "that is , @xmath30 now we identify a subset @xmath31 of `` transmitting '' states ; non - transmitting states are those not in @xmath32 .",
    "there is also a subset @xmath33 of the same size as @xmath32 , which we call `` post - transmitting '' states .",
    "we now require five things about the update rule @xmath4 .    1 .",
    "@xmath34 iff @xmath35 for any configuration of neighbor states . transmitting states , and only those ,",
    "evolve into post - transmitting states .",
    "if @xmath34 then for any two neighbor states @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath19 is a transmitting state , the new cell state does not depend on the particular neighbor states .",
    "3 .   if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "two distinct transmitting states evolve into two distinct post - transmitting states .",
    "the update rule on transmitting states ( which is effectively a simple map from @xmath32 to @xmath41 ) is 1 - 1 ( and thus onto ) .",
    "4 .   if @xmath42 , then for any @xmath43 we have @xmath44 .",
    "the values of non - transmitting neighbor states do not affect the update of a non - transmitting cell state .",
    "5 .   if @xmath45 and @xmath39 , then for a given configuration of neighbor states , @xmath40 .",
    "( and from the previous requirement , we know that only the transmitting states in the neighborhood configuration make any difference . )",
    "our basic claim is that any such rule is reversible .",
    "we prove this by explicitly constructing an inverse ca rule @xmath22 from the forward rule @xmath4 .",
    "the inverse rule @xmath22 has the same neighborhood configuration as @xmath4 .",
    "we define the inverse rule as follows .",
    "first , suppose @xmath46 .",
    "then by conditions 13 above , there exists a unique @xmath34 such that @xmath47 . for any neighbor configuration ,",
    "define @xmath48 .",
    "now suppose @xmath49 .",
    "each of the neighbor states @xmath50 is either in @xmath41 or not . if",
    "not , choose @xmath28 for that cell to be any state not in @xmath32 ( since its exact value , by condition 4 , will not matter ) .",
    "if @xmath51 , then choose @xmath52 to be the state that maps to @xmath50 under @xmath4 ( and thus that @xmath50 maps to @xmath28 under @xmath22 as already defined ) .",
    "this means that we can reconstruct the `` context '' of transmitting neighbor states @xmath28 which governed the update of the central cell under @xmath4 . by condition 5",
    ", there is a unique @xmath34 such that @xmath53 define @xmath54 .",
    "we have thus defined the rule @xmath22 so that it exactly inverts the action of update rule @xmath4 , both for cells that have states in @xmath32 at time @xmath9 ( that is , @xmath41 at time @xmath23 ) and cells that do not .",
    "the ca rule @xmath4 is therefore invertible .    in an alternating - grid rule",
    ", there is a fixed alternating pattern of transmitting and non - transmitting cells , the checkerboard `` texture '' of black and white cells . in a transmitting - state rule",
    ", the pattern of transmitting states is itself dynamically determined by the action of the ca rule @xmath4 .",
    "this allows a far greater range of possible rules and behaviors .",
    "so far , we have given general conditions for transmitting - state rules without a recipe for creating them .",
    "now we give one such recipe , though the transmitting - state class includes many other kinds of examples .",
    "we take the set of cell states to be @xmath55 , containing @xmath56 elements .",
    "the set @xmath32 of transmitting states contains the @xmath57 elements @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the non - transmitting states only include states 0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the update rule for a transmitting state simply increments the state by 1 . that is , for @xmath34 , @xmath60 .",
    "the transmitting states thus advance regularly via @xmath61 .",
    "this automatically satisfies conditions 13 for a transmitting - state rule .",
    "how is a cell in a non - transmitting state updated ?",
    "non - transmitting states 0 or @xmath2 can result in non - post - transmitting states 0 or 1 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "we choose @xmath63 to be any @xmath64-valued function of the transmitting states and their arrangement in the neighborhood .",
    "( since the @xmath4 value depends only on the neighbor states that are in @xmath32 , it satisfies condition 4 above . )",
    "we then require @xmath65 , the binary complement of the value for the same arrangements of neighborhood transmitting states .",
    "this guarantees that we will also satisfy condition 5 , yielding a transmitting - state invertible ca rule .    as a specific example , consider a rule on a 1-d grid with a 3-cell neighborhood , so the update rule is of the form @xmath66 , a function of the left , center and right cells of the neighborhood .",
    "the set of states @xmath67 .",
    "the only transmitting state is 1 and the only post - transmitting state is 2 .",
    "our update rule is given by @xmath68 this rule happens to be the 3-state invertible ca numbered 1123289366095 in wolfram s enumeration of such rules ( as shown in @xcite , p. 436 ) .",
    "the evolution of a random initial grid under this ca rule is shown in figure  [ fig - spacetime ] .",
    ", height=240 ]    as can be seen , this ca rule allows the existence of both persistent spatial structures and long - range information exchange .",
    "the inverse rule for this example is easily found .",
    "we can write it this way : @xmath69 in fact , this is exactly the same rule , with the roles of state 1 and state 2 exchanged .",
    "many invertible ca rules , especially those of interest for modeling physical systems , have a conserved quantity , which we may conveniently call `` energy '' .",
    "the energy is an additive local function .",
    "that is , for each small neighborhood @xmath2 ( not necessarily identical to a neighborhood for the ca rule ) there is a local energy @xmath70 , and the total energy is just the sum of the local energies of all the overlapping neighborhoods in the grid .",
    "the 3-state rule we describe above turns out to have a straightforward conserved energy .",
    "the local energy @xmath71 depends on the joint state of a pair adjacent cells : @xmath72 the local energy @xmath71 resides in the `` bond '' between adjacent cells .",
    "the total energy @xmath73 is the sum of all the bond energies .",
    "energy @xmath73 will be conserved provided there exists a local `` energy flow '' function @xmath74 , which is defined at each cell and depends on the states of that cell and its neighbors .",
    "the left - right symmetry of both the update rule and the local energy function means that @xmath74 needs to be an antisymmetric function .",
    "that is , given cell states @xmath75 , @xmath19 and @xmath76 at time @xmath9 ( determining the cell state @xmath77 at time @xmath23 ) , the flow @xmath74 satisfies @xmath78 the flow @xmath74 is to be interpreted as the rightward flow of energy , so that a negative value of @xmath74 is a flow in the opposite direction .",
    "just as @xmath71 is localized between cells , we can regard @xmath74 to be localized between time steps @xmath9 and @xmath23 .     and",
    "energy flow @xmath74 in a small section of a spacetime diagram for our example ca rule.[fig - energyflow],height=120 ]    consider then the situation shown in figure  [ fig - energyflow ] . at time @xmath9 , the pair of cells with states @xmath79 and @xmath80 have a local bond energy @xmath81 .",
    "these cell states update to @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath23 , yielding a new bond energy @xmath84 .",
    "( the updated cell states also depend on the adjacent states @xmath85 and @xmath86 at time @xmath9 . )",
    "the two cells are associated with energy flows @xmath87 and @xmath88 , also shown in figure  [ fig - energyflow ] .",
    "energy is conserved provided we can show that the change @xmath89 in local energy is entirely due to the net inward flow @xmath74 into that region during the cell update  that is , @xmath90 .",
    "we must show that , for all cell states @xmath85 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath86 , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by the ca update rule , @xmath91 a suitable definition of @xmath74 for our example can be given as follows : @xmath92 for any set of states with @xmath93 ( a symmetric neighborhood state ) .",
    "also @xmath92 for all other states , with the following exceptions : @xmath94    we can now in principle check all @xmath95 possible cases for equation  [ eq - localconservation ] . in practice , we only need to examine a much smaller number of distinct , non - trivial cases .",
    "for instance , suppose @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 according to our rule .",
    "the initial and final energies are @xmath98 , while @xmath99 .",
    "the two flows are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "equation  [ eq - localconservation ] clearly holds ; and by symmetry it also holds for the reflected case @xmath102 .",
    "( right ) for the same initial grid.[fig - stateenergy],height=240 ]    figure  [ fig - stateenergy ] shows both the state evolution and the distribution of energy for the same initial grid .",
    "energy flows are easily visible as leftward and rightward movements of elementary energy units .",
    "transmitting - state cellular automata are a generalization of the alternating - subgrid ca s , and like them can be used to construct invertible ca rules that produce complex behavior .",
    "we have given a general definition of transmitting - state rules and explored a specific example in some detail .",
    "many questions remain .",
    "the alternating - subgrid class includes rules of special interest for modeling physical systems .",
    "consider , for example , the 2-d `` reversible ising '' ca rule . in this rule ,",
    "spins ( with @xmath103 ) are located on a checkerboard grid and given an ising - type energy function @xmath104 where the sum ranges over all pairs of immediate neighbors @xmath105 . at any even time @xmath9 ,",
    "each spin on a white square is inverted provided this does not change the energy ; at any odd time @xmath9 the same procedure is followed for the spins on black squares .",
    "the rule is obviously invertible and conserves the ising energy .",
    "thus it is an interesting model of the microscopic dynamics of a ferromagnetic system .",
    "does the larger transmitting - state class of ca rules , which in effect have shifting , dynamically produced `` alternating subgrids '' , include other models for more disordered magnetic systems ",
    ", for spin glasses ?",
    "we also note that our very simple example of a transmitting - state rule ( one of the simplest non - trivial rules possible ) has a simple conserved energy function .",
    "are such functions more common and/or easier to identify in transmitting - state rules ?",
    "reversible cellular automata have been generalized to quantum cellular automata @xcite .",
    "any reversible state function @xmath106 can be made into a unitary map by applying it to a basis of states : @xmath107 .",
    "we can always do this for the global state of a ca grid .",
    "however , locality of the reversible classical rule does not guarantee locality of the corresponding quantum rule .",
    "( this objection does not arise for the partitioning type of reversible ca , so these can always be generalized to a quantum version . )",
    "the transmitting - state idea is based on the notion of one - way information flow , and we know that this is impossible in unitary quantum interactions @xcite",
    ". how does this lead to a failure of locality in the `` unitarized '' version ? or are there examples that can be made into unitary qca s , despite this difficulty ?",
