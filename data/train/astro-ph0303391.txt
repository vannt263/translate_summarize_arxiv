    "the commonly accepted , albeit somewhat arbitrary , definition of whether an elliptical galaxy is a dwarf galaxy depends on whether its absolute magnitude is fainter than @xmath16 ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ) .",
    "( @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ) has been used by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) . ]",
    "the realization that dwarf ellipticals could be reasonably well described with an exponential function ( faber & lin 1983 ; binggeli , sandage & tarenghi 1984 ) and that bright ellipticals are better fit with de vaucouleurs ( 1948 , 1959 ) @xmath19-law led to the notion that they are two distinct families of galaxies ( wirth & gallagher 1984 , but see also graham 2002a ) .",
    "one of the most referenced papers to support this view is kormendy ( 1985 ) .",
    "plotting central surface brightness against luminosity , kormendy s figure 3 shows two relations ( almost at right angles to each other ) : one for the de galaxies and the other for the luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "similarly , diagrams using @xmath14 , the surface brightness at the effective half - light radius @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , the average surface brightness within @xmath20 , also show two somewhat perpendicular relations .",
    "the reason for these differences , generally interpreted as evidence for a different formation mechanism , are far from broadly understood and will therefore be addressed in this paper .",
    "in contrast to the above , there is substantial evidence for a continuity , rather than a dichotomy , between the alleged elliptical ( e ) and dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxy classes .",
    "caldwell ( 1983 ; their figure 6 ) showed that , fainter than @xmath22 , there is a continuous trend between the central surface brightnesses and absolute magnitudes of de and e galaxies  more luminous galaxies have brighter central surface brightnesses ( caldwell 1987 ; caldwell and bothun 1987 ; ferguson & sandage 1988 ; karachentsev et al .",
    "1995 ; hilker et al .  1999 ; drinkwater et al .  2001 ;",
    "hilker , mieske , & infante 2003 ) .",
    "this observation has been highlighted by jerjen & binggeli ( 1997 ) and jerjen , binggeli , & freeman ( 2000a ) note that even the brightest elliptical galaxies ( with partially evacuated cores ) follow the same continuous and linear trend if one uses the inwardly extrapolated central surface brightness of the best - fitting srsic model ( fitted outside of the core region ) .",
    "caldwell ( 1983 ) also revealed a continuous and linear relationship exists between ( @xmath23 ) color and luminosity over the magnitude interval @xmath24 ( see terlevich , caldwell , & bower 2001 , and odell , schombert , & rakos 2002 for recent reviews ) .",
    "scodeggio ( 2001 ) showed this relation may , however , be far weaker than previously thought once one allows for color gradients and uses effective radii rather than fixed aperture sizes ( see also the simulations of cole et al",
    ".  2000 ) .",
    "relatedly , caldwell & bothun ( 1987 ) revealed a continuous luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation across the alleged de / e classes ( barazza & binggeli 2002 ) .",
    "previous studies of the luminosity - metallicity relation predominantly dealt with brighter galaxy samples : faber 1973 ; terlevich et al .  1981 ; tonry & davis 1981 ; dressler 1984 ; vader 1986 .",
    "the relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion for e galaxies ( faber & jackson 1976 , tonry 1981 ) has also been shown to extend linearly to include the de galaxies ( e.g. , bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ) .",
    "there is additionally a continuous correlation between luminosity and globular cluster metallicity ( forbes et al .",
    "none of these correlations with luminosity suggest evidence for a discontinuity at @xmath25 .    to address the evidence for a dichotomy , we must turn to the issue of galaxy structure .",
    "it was realized over a decade ago that the light - profile shapes of dwarf and bright elliptical galaxies display , respectively , luminosity - dependent departures from the exponential and @xmath19 models ( e.g. , capaccioli 1984 , 1987 ; michard 1985 ; schombert 1986 ; caldwell & bothun 1987 ; djorgovski & kormendy 1989 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ; prugniel , bica , & alloin 1992 ; james 1991 , 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , the luminosity dependence of galaxy concentration / profile - shape was known by baade ( 1944 ) .",
    "srsic s ( 1968 ) @xmath0 model can encompass both de vaucouleurs @xmath19-law and the exponential model , and a variety of other profile shapes by varying its exponent @xmath6 .",
    "it offers a means to explore the observed range of galaxy structures , and can be written as @xmath26 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where the intensity @xmath27 at the half - light radius @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "the third parameter @xmath6 describes the shape , or curvature , of the light - profile .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is a function of @xmath6 , and is approximately @xmath31 ( graham 2001 ) .",
    "the differences between an @xmath32 and an @xmath33 ( or 3 ) profile are quite distinct ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and it is now almost universally accepted that de galaxies possess different profile shapes . however , in the case of brighter elliptical galaxies , as noted by makino , akiyama , & sugimoto ( 1990 ) , real departures from an @xmath19 model are often missed .",
    "one reason for this is because of the similarity of the srsic model when dealing with a restricted radial range of a galaxy s surface brightness profile and when @xmath34 . despite the lack of any physical meaning for the @xmath19 model",
    ", some authors have actually restricted the inner and outer radial extent of elliptical galaxy light - profiles ( e.g. , burkert 1993 ) , or adjusted the sky - background level ( e.g. , tonry et al .",
    "1997 ) , in order to make the @xmath19 model fit  such is the ingrained belief in this classical model .",
    "other authors have chosen not to vary the srsic exponent because they find @xmath20 and @xmath14 measurements are more stable if @xmath6 is fixed .",
    "unfortunately , this has nothing to do with ensuring the accurate recovery of the true half - light radius and surface brightness ; setting @xmath35 , for example , will have similar results on the perceived stability .    schombert ( 1986 ) recognized the inadequacy of the @xmath19 model to describe luminous es , finding it only fitted the middle part @xmath36 of bright galaxy profiles .",
    "djorgovski & kormendy ( 1989 ) noted that it fits best elliptical galaxies with @xmath37 ; brighter and fainter galaxies having different curvature than described by the @xmath19 model .",
    "that is , although real , luminosity - dependent , departures from the @xmath19 model have been known to exist for well over a decade , unfortunately , even today , they are often not even explored .",
    "however , as we will see , such deviations provide the key to understanding the true nature / connection between de and e galaxies .    studying a sample of 80 early - type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters with the srsic model , caon , capaccioli , & donofrio s ( 1993 ) and donofrio , capaccioli , & caon s ( 1994 ) exploration of how the elliptical galaxy profile shapes ( n )",
    "vary systematically with the _ model - independent _ half - light galactic radii ( and luminosity ) has been monumental in advancing our understanding of elliptical galaxies  placing it on a quantitative footing .",
    "furthermore , by including a sample of 187 dwarf galaxies , modelled by davies et al .",
    "( 1988 ) using this same generalized profile , caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that one continuous trend between galaxy size and profile shape spanned both galaxy classes .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) subsequently showed this same trend to continue for even the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "the shape of an elliptical galaxy s light - profile has since been shown to correlate strongly with other galactic quantities which have also been obtained independently of the srsic model .",
    "for example , graham et al .",
    "( 2001b , 2002b ) showed how the logarithm of @xmath6 correlated with a galaxy s central velocity dispersion ( correlation coefficient @xmath38 ) .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 2001a , 2002a ) showed the logarithm of @xmath6 to correlate ( @xmath39 ) with a galaxy s supermassive black hole mass .",
    "different profile shapes are therefore obviously real , and can be parameterized with the srsic @xmath0 model .",
    "indeed , just as de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) showed that beyond 10@xmath40 , @xmath41 provided a good fit to the profile of ngc  3379 ( spanning 10 mag of surface brightness ) , bertin , ciotti , & del principe ( 2002 ) have shown that very different values of @xmath6 provide equally good fits to the extended profiles of other elliptical galaxies . far from a dichotomy , at least in terms of galaxy profile shape and luminosity , dwarf and",
    "bright elliptical galaxies are extensions of each other ( cellone , forte , & geisler 1994 ; young & currie 1994 , 1995 , 1998 ; durrell 1997 ; gerbal et al .",
    "1997 ; graham & colless 1997 ; jerjen & binggeli 1997 ; prugniel & simien 1997 ; trujillo , graham , & caon 2001 ) .    in section 2 we introduce our sample of 18 coma cluster , de galaxy candidates imaged with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 camera .",
    "we describe the data reduction and profile extraction .",
    "possibly for the first time , we show that the srsic model , combined with an optional central point - source or central moffat - convolved gaussian , provides a good description to the full radial extent of _ hst_-resolved de galaxy light - profiles . the structural parameters from the fitted models will be used in an exploration of the fundamental plane for de galaxies ( guzmn et al .",
    "2003 , in prep ) . in section 3",
    "we confirm the trend between profile shape and luminosity found by others who had previously excluded the nuclear region in their modelling .",
    "we also explain the relation between inner profile slope ( @xmath7 ) and luminosity as a consequence of the relation between global profile shape @xmath6 and luminosity .",
    "we additionally observe a relationship between the luminosity of the underlying galaxy and the luminosity of the central component in de galaxies . finally , in section 4",
    ", we show how the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath21 ( and also @xmath14 ) varies with light - profile shape and consequently with galaxy luminosity . combining our de data with a larger sample of literature data",
    ", we subsequently reveal how a continuous and linear relation between @xmath5 and luminosity results in an apparent de / e dichotomy when one plots either @xmath21 ( or @xmath14 ) against luminosity .",
    "an apparent dichotomy is thus expected in the @xmath21@xmath15 diagram .",
    "a summary is given in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath42 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "there have been many recent studies of the surface brightness profiles of coma cluster galaxies ( e.g. , gerbal 1997 ; mobasher et al .  1999 ; khosroshahi , wadadekar , & kembhavi 2000 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2000 ; komiyama et al .",
    "2002 ; trujillo et al .  2002 ) .",
    "these studies used ground - based images . as our interest lies in the properties of de galaxies having half - light radii of only a couple of arcseconds , we have obtained archival _ hst _ images . moreover , de galaxies are often nucleated ; failing to separate the excess nuclear light from the underlying galaxy light can severely bias the structural parameter analysis ( e.g. , balcells et al .",
    "although the coma cluster is more distant than , for example , the virgo and fornax clusters , due to the high resolution of the _ hst _ we have been able to acquire surface brightness profiles of a quality better than typical ground - based profiles of virgo and fornax de galaxies . additionally , one of us ( r.g . )",
    "has already studied the structural , chemical , and dynamical properties of coma s brightest cluster members ( guzmn , lucey , & bower 1993 ) .",
    "our coma cluster de galaxy candidates were chosen using @xmath43- , @xmath44- , and @xmath45-band images of the central @xmath46 region obtained with wiyn / minimo and the int / wide field camera .",
    "a detailed discussion of the selection criteria is provided in matkovi & guzmn ( 2003 , in prep ) .",
    "the selection criteria can be summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , a color cut was applied in the @xmath47 vs.   @xmath48 diagram such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "galaxies in this sample follow the same @xmath47 and @xmath48 color - magnitude relations defined by the bright ellipticals in coma . according to galaxy evolutionary synthesis models",
    ", this color cut also minimizes contamination from background field disk galaxies at z@xmath510.2 , which may affect galaxy samples at faint magnitudes .",
    "secondly , a limiting magnitude cut was applied such that @xmath52 .",
    "this was applied in order to select `` dwarf '' galaxies with @xmath53 in the coma cluster  assuming coma to be at a distance of 100 mpc .",
    "spectra for a sub - sample of these coma cluster de - candidates were obtained using wiyn / hydra .",
    "the 18 galaxies presented in this paper correspond to all the objects with _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 f606w images in this sub - sample whose",
    "redshifts confirmed their coma cluster membership . despite being bonafide cluster members",
    ", we continue referring to them as coma cluster de candidates since some of these objects turn out to have morphologies more consistent with being dwarf disk galaxies , as discussed below",
    ".    table 1 provides the identification of our galaxy sample , as denoted in the godwin , metcalfe & peach s ( 1983 ) coma galaxy catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents a mosaic containing the 18 _ hst _ archival f6060w images of our sample of de galaxy candidates in the coma cluster .",
    "the images were obtained from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the two main original programs from which these images were taken were aimed at studying the central cores , and the globular cluster populations , of bright elliptical galaxies in coma .",
    "the elliptical galaxies were centered in the planetary camera .",
    "our de galaxy candidates were found in the three wide field chips , i.e. , at an angular distance of less than @xmath511.5@xmath54 from a bright elliptical galaxy .",
    "the _ hst _ images were reduced following the standard _ hst _ pipeline , combined and cleaned of cosmic - rays using crreject , further cleaned of cosmic rays using ` lacos ` ( l.a.cosmic , van dokkum 2001 ) , and background subtracted using the wavelet decomposition method by vikhlinin et al .",
    "this variable large - scale subtraction was needed in order to define an accurate asymptotic value for the curve of growth that is otherwise not well - defined due to the contamination of nearby galaxy halos for many of our objects .",
    "photometry was performed using the iraf task ` ellipse ` with both the galaxy center ( determined with the task ` center ` ) and the position angle ( measured at @xmath512.5@xmath40 , roughly 1 @xmath20 ) fixed .",
    "the ellipticity was allowed to vary .",
    "the position angle was , however , allowed to vary for a couple of galaxies ( gmp  3625 and gmp  3629 ; godwin , metcalfe , & peach 1983 ) where @xmath5160 - 80@xmath55 differences exist between the position angles of the inner and outer isophotes .",
    "gmp  3629 is almost perfectly round and so these changes are not surprising , gmp  3625 has an ellipticity of 0.17 - 0.40 .",
    "surface brightness profiles and curves - of - growth were derived with the key assumption that the curve - of - growth had to flatten at large radii , i.e. , the asymptotic value is well - defined . in some cases",
    "this required a small constant background subtraction to remove residual sky . only in those cases where the galaxies were so close to the edge of the chip that the profile could not be measured over the entire galaxy was the condition of a flat curve - of - growth relaxed . in these cases ,",
    "the sky was estimated as the median value at large distances from the galaxy .",
    "we note that an unambiguous estimate of the sky - background is not always possible and the results may be affected by a certain subjectivity in the way the background was subtracted .",
    "however , results from independent surface brightness profiles obtained from different images of the same galaxy are in good agreement with each other ( see later ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are presented in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , shown as a function of the geometric mean radius @xmath56 . as we had multiple profiles for each galaxy ,",
    "the most typical have been shown .",
    "the error bars shown on the profile data represent the errors associated to photon - noise and read - out - noise .",
    "systematic errors in the sky - background associated with residual contamination by the halos of other galaxies are not included .",
    "we model individual profiles as a combination of a psf - convolved @xmath0 bulge model ( trujillo et al .",
    "2001 ) and either a point - source or a psf - convolved central gaussian .",
    "an optional psf - convolved outer exponential model was used for galaxies with an obvious two component structure ( in addition to the nuclear source ) .",
    "the moffat psf , and hence the point source profile , was measured from nearby stars or globular clusters on each chip .",
    "for any given galaxy , all the structural parameters were obtained simultaneously .",
    "we have verified that every galaxy s major - axis profile required the same composition of components as the geometric mean profiles , confirming our final component selection shown in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "no signal - to - noise ( _ s / n _ ) weighting was employed as it can result in poor fits when the inner profile contains additional components which are not considered in the modelling process .",
    "for example , if we only fitted _ s / n_-weighted @xmath0 models , the presence of the nuclear components would severely bias the @xmath0 fits , producing erroneously high values of @xmath6 .",
    "we have estimated the errors on the structural parameters by modelling different images of the same galaxy .",
    "sometimes the exposure times were different , other times the galaxy appeared on a different wfpc2 chip .",
    "our error estimates therefore include the effects of : shot - noise , placement on the chip , estimation of the galaxy orientation and center , and the associated influence of pixelation . additionally , by modelling the sky - background in different ways we have been able to further gauge the likely accuracy of the fitted model parameters .",
    "in all cases when we had multiple light - profiles , which we did for most galaxies , the surface brightness profiles were consistent with each other down to a level of @xmath57 mag arcsec@xmath58 .",
    "fitting models down to this surface brightness level we found the differences in the best - fitting srsic parameters obtained from different profiles of the same galaxy spanned @xmath590.05 mag arcsec@xmath58 in @xmath14 , @xmath595% in @xmath20 , and @xmath594% in @xmath6 .",
    "most profiles are not consistent with the @xmath6=1 exponential model .      before proceeding , we checked for the presence of dwarf s0 galaxies ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ) in our sample . from the image and surface brightness profile of gmp  3292",
    "it is clearly not a de galaxy ; there is evidence of faint outer spiral arms ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , and it has a two - component light - profile which is not due to nucleation . with a recessional velocity of 4955 km s@xmath18 ( matkovi & guzmn 2003 , in prep ) , this galaxy is not a background galaxy . and reside within 20 arcmin from the cluster center , consistent with being cluster members ( kent & gunn 1982 ) . the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of the coma cluster are respectively @xmath517,000 km s@xmath18 and @xmath511,000 km s@xmath18 ( edwards et al .",
    "its central surface brightness is brighter than @xmath60 mag arcsec@xmath58 , and so technically it is not a dwarf spiral galaxy , as defined by schombert et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . due to the significant prominance of its bulge , it is also not a small late - type disk galaxy .",
    "gmp  3292 is thus likely to be a dwarf s0 galaxy . unlike the extraordinarily faint inner spiral arms found by jerjen , kalnajs , & binggeli ( 2000 ) in the ( previously classified ) de , n galaxy ic  3328",
    ", the arms in gmp  3292 are actually quite visible in the outer parts of gmp  3292 .",
    "an examination of the type performed by jerjen , kalnajs , & binggeli ( 2000b ) and barazza , binggeli , & jerjen ( 2002 ) is beyond the intended scope of this paper and will be left for future investigation .",
    "our sole objective here is to identify and exclude possible two component galaxies ( not counting nucleation as a component ) .",
    "in addition to gmp  3292 , we will exclude two further galaxies .",
    "neither gmp  2960 nor gmp  3486 can be described with a global srsic model plus some small nuclear component .",
    "fwhm _ of the best - fitting central gaussian , when simultaneously fitted with a global srsic model , is greater than 0.5@xmath40 , or @xmath51235 pc , for both of these galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows both of these profiles fitted with an inner srsic model plus an outer exponential model .",
    "we are unable to say whether the outer exponential is that of a flattened disk , as in the case of a dwarf s0 galaxy , or whether the outer exponential is actually the underlying host galaxy and the inner srsic model is describing an excessively large nuclear star cluster .",
    "the latter scenario might represent the evolved state of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ; doublier , caulet , & comte 1999 ; cairs et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) , although this suggestion is purely speculative on our part .",
    "we do note that the ellipticity in gmp  2960 changes from 0.06 at 1.27 arcseconds ( the half - light radius of the inner srsic component ) to 0.51 at 13.3 arcseconds ( the outer most data point modelled by us ) , suggestive , albeit not conclusive , of an inclined outer disk .",
    "for gmp  3486 , the ellipticity decreases with radius ( see table 2 ) .",
    "lastly , gmp  3629 may also possess an outer disk ; there is the suggestion of faint spiral arms in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , the width of the nuclear component in gmp  3629 is only 0.12@xmath40 ( @xmath51 60 pc ) , possibly too small to be considered a bulge .",
    "we do however note the the alternative possibility that the disk may not actually dominate until radii greater than 10@xmath40 , the inner profile ( 0.110@xmath40 ) dominated by the bulge light and the central 0.1@xmath40 dominated by a nuclear star cluster .",
    "we feel , however , to conclude there is a disk beyond 10@xmath40 would place too much faith in the outer , low surface brightness profile .",
    "nonetheless , if this is the case , we found that the srsic parameters from such a bulge / disk decomposition are very similar to those already given in table 2 .",
    "similarly for gmp  2955 and a couple of other galaxies , a diffuse outer envelope / disk / halo of stars may exist beyond our surface brightness cutoff at @xmath61 mag arcsec@xmath58 .",
    "however , including this ( potential ) outer exponential component in the modelling process did not substantially modify the parameters of the more luminous inner srsic component .    table 2 provides the structural parameters and some derived quantities for our sample .",
    "no surface brightness corrections have been applied here .",
    "a quick and dirty comparison of our total ( extrapolated to infinity ) @xmath62 magnitudes versus the photographic @xmath30-band magnitudes ( within the @xmath63 mag isophote ) from godwin et al .  (",
    "1983 ) is shown in figure  [ figx ] .",
    "the agreement is encouraging , especially given that the color term is likely to be different for each galaxy .",
    "the line which is shown simply represents a constant color difference of 1.0 mag .",
    "the potential disk galaxy gmp  3486 is the only notable outlier , some 0.5 mag deviant , and ( along with gmp  3292 and gmp  2960 ) it will be excluded from here on .",

    "there is a fair amount of scatter in these sparsely populated diagrams .",

    "( 2003 ) have recently shown the magnitudes of the nuclear components in the bulges of early - type disk galaxies correlate strongly ( @xmath71=0.77 ) with these galaxy s bulge magnitudes .    an orthogonal regression analysis on figure  [ fig6]a yields @xmath72 using the f606w filter , which is equivalent to @xmath73 to explore the stability of this relation , and",
    "obtain a more robust result , we have re - derived this correlation after excluding two potential outlying galaxies ; specifically , those with the brightest nuclear components ( gmp  3018 and gmp  3645 ) : @xmath74 more data is of course required before equations  [ point ] or [ punt ] can be considered universal for nucleated de galaxies .",
    "environment may also play a role .",
    "having modeled the nuclear component , we can now explore the inner slope of the underlying host galaxy profile .",
    "interest in this quantity arose from the discovery of a bimodal distribution of slopes for e galaxies more luminous that @xmath25 ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the implication of a different galaxy formation process .    for a srsic model",
    ", the negative logarithmic slope of the light - profile at any radius @xmath45 can be given by the expression @xmath75 for a fixed @xmath76 ratio , @xmath7 is thus a monotonically increasing function of @xmath6 ( graham et al .  2002b ; their figure 4 ) .",
    "_ given the correlation between @xmath6 and magnitude ( figure  [ fig5]d ) , @xmath7 is therefore obviously correlated with magnitude . _    rather than",
    "use @xmath77 , that is , ignoring differences in galaxy size , figure  [ fig7 ] shows a plot of @xmath78 versus the host galaxy magnitude .",
    "although we recognize this is perhaps not the best estimate of the inner profile slope , as it measures the slope at different fractions of the half - light radius , and identical galaxies in clusters at different distances will be sampled at different physical radii , it is nonetheless somewhat comparative with past investigations .",
    "we have used a @xmath79_f606w _ color of 1.08 ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1994 ) in order to present @xmath44-band magnitudes for our galaxy sample .",
    "the profile slope @xmath7 was derived from the fitted srsic model and therefore explicitly avoids any potential bias in the slope from additional nuclear components . to figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "we have added the de galaxy data from stiavelli et al .",
    "following carollo et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , they computed the average logarithmic profile slope from 0.1 - 0.5 arcseconds .",
    "conversion from the _ hst _ f555w filter used by stiavelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to the @xmath44-band used by the nuker team was performed by us assuming a constant @xmath80 color of 0.9 .",
    "the nuker team s bright elliptical galaxy sample ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , excluding their s0 galaxies , are also included here . in spite of the different methods and radial ranges used to obtain the inner profile slope , and inaccuracies from our assumption of constant color terms",
    ", there is a general correlation in figure  [ fig7 ] such that the inner profile slope steepens as the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy brightens .",
    "this trend , albeit with the odd outlier , can be seen to continue until the onset of core formation in the brightest elliptical galaxies .",
    "the observed cores in the luminous elliptical galaxies are thought to have arisen from the partial evacuation of the nuclear region by coalescing blackholes ( e.g. , ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura 1991 ; makino & ebisuzaki 1996 ; komossa et al .",
    "whatever process(es ) have reduced these galaxies central surface brightness profiles , the high luminosity `` core '' galaxies clearly depart from the relation defined by galaxies without cores .",
    "presumably the depletion of the core occurs rapidly , hence the observed gap @xmath81 at the bright end of the relation ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; gebhardt et al .  1996",
    "; faber et al .",

    "to illustrate the continuity between the de and e galaxies , and at the same time explain their apparently different behavior in certain structural parameter diagrams , we will use the large compilation of de and e galaxies presented in graham et al .",
    "( 2002b , their figure 1 ) .",
    "this collection of 232 galaxies spans 10 mag in absolute magnitude and consists of the luminous e galaxies from the sample of faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the intermediate - to - bright e galaxies from caon et al .",

    "( 1993 ) and donofrio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we will use the best - fitting srsic model value .",
    "however , because of core formation , we have excluded those galaxies from these authors with @xmath82 mag in the plots using central surface brightness .",
    "finally , we have added our own sample of coma de galaxies .",
    "we additionally show correlations using @xmath14 , @xmath21 , @xmath15 , and @xmath67 , which are not shown in graham et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the only _ hst _ study of de galaxy surface brightness profiles that we are aware of is that by stiavelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . after excluding the inner arcsecond of the profiles because of nucleation , they fitted exponential , @xmath19 , and srsic models to a sample of 23 virgo and fornax cluster , and 2 leo group , de galaxies . ] . from their error analysis ,",
    "only 7 of these galaxies have profiles consistent ( at the 2@xmath83 level ) with an exponential @xmath32 model ( see their table 2 ) .    for the full galaxy sample , figure  [ fig8 ] shows , when available , the absolute @xmath44-band galaxy magnitude plotted against three measures of surface brightness : the mean surface brightness @xmath21 within the effective half - light radius @xmath20 ; the surface brightness @xmath14 at the half - light radius ; and the central surface brightness @xmath5 of the host galaxy ( excluding the flux from nuclear components ) .",
    "the middle panel shows these three surface brightness values versus the logarithm of the srsic index @xmath6 , while the lower panel shows these three values against the logarithm of the half - light radius @xmath20 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 , and the absolute magnitudes , were obtained from the above papers and re - derived assuming a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath18 and a virgo and fornax distance modulus of 31.2 .",
    "one of the most quoted papers to support the de / e dichotomy is that of kormendy ( 1985 ) . in that paper",
    "the author wrote that , `` the most surprising result of this paper is that there is a large discontinuity between the parameter correlations for elliptical and dwarf spheroidals '' , and concluded that `` dwarf elliptical galaxies are very different from the sequence of giant ellipticals . ''",
    "this conclusion was based largely on figure 3 ( top right panel ) from that paper , which included 11 dwarf elliptical galaxies and a number of luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , this plot of central surface brightness versus galaxy magnitude does show a large discontinuity between the de and e galaxies .",
    "however , there is an absence of galaxies with magnitudes around @xmath84 in this sample , exactly where one might expect to see the two groups connect .",
    "nearly a decade later , the astronomy and astrophysics review paper by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ; their figure 3 ) had a big question mark as to `` how '' and indeed `` if '' the de and e galaxies might actually connect in this diagram .",
    "that is to say , the idea of a discontinuity has been around ( and largely accepted ) for many years .",
    "if we are to remove galaxies having @xmath84 from our diagram of @xmath5 vs.  @xmath85 ( figure  [ fig8]c ) we will obtain a figure which looks very much the same as kormendy s figure .",
    "_ thus , the answer to the believed dichotomy lies , in part , in the sample selection used by kormendy ( 1985 ) .",
    "this explains the discontinuity but not the change in the slope .",
    "the answer to the latter resides in the observation that luminous elliptical galaxies possess partially evacuated `` cores''_. their central surface brightnesses are thought to be a modification of their original , more luminous value . as stressed in graham et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , the brighter galaxies lying perpendicular to the relation defined by the less luminous ( @xmath86 ) elliptical galaxies in the @xmath5-@xmath85 diagram are all `` core '' galaxies .",
    "there is no dichotomy at @xmath25 in this diagram .",
    "however , there is a `` dichotomy '' at @xmath22 ; but this is not necessarily the result of a different initial formation mechanism for galaxies brighter or fainter than this value .",
    "rather , ( subsequent ) core formation has apparently modified the central surface brightness in galaxies brighter than @xmath22 . the initial mechanism(s ) of de and e galaxy formation are therefore likely to be the same given the continuity at @xmath16 . importantly",
    ", luminous elliptical galaxies should not be viewed as the norm , but instead are the exception to the relation between central surface brightness and magnitude which exists over ( at least ) some 8 mag . indeed ,",
    "analysing over 100 dwarf spheroidals ( @xmath87 mag , grebel 2001 ) , hilker , mieske , & infante ( 2003 ) and grebel , gallagher , & harbeck ( 2003 ) show that this trend continues down to at least @xmath88 mag .    a second reason why people have thought that luminous e galaxies are different from low - luminosity ( dwarf ) elliptical galaxies is because they do nt follow the same @xmath85@xmath14 ( and @xmath85@xmath21 ) relation , as seen in figure  [ fig8]b ( and figure  [ fig8]a ) . given that there is a continuous and linear relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath5 , suggestive of a similar formation mechanism , until the subsequent ( ? ) process of core formation , why is the relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath14 ( and @xmath21 ) apparently different for the de and e galaxies ?",
    "it turns out the reason for this has nothing to do with core formation but is due to the systematic changes in profile shape with galaxy magnitude ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "for the srsic model , @xmath89 and @xmath90\\ ] ] ( see , e.g. , caon et al .",
    "1994 ; graham & colless 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the differences between @xmath5 and @xmath14 , and @xmath5 and @xmath21 , as a function of profile shape @xmath6 .",
    "the line in figure  [ fig9 ] is now used to determine a representative value of @xmath6 for a given @xmath85 . using this correlation , the line shown in figure  [ fig8]c",
    "can then be transformed into a relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath14 ( and @xmath85 and @xmath21 ) and is shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "one can immediately see that we have reproduced the observed correlations in figure  [ fig8]a and [ fig8]b .",
    "the apparently different slope for the de and e galaxies in these diagrams is merely a consequence of a continuously varying profile shape with galaxy luminosity  it certainly does not imply a different galaxy formation mechanism . without this understanding , these diagrams had been a considerable red herring to our understanding of de / e galaxy formation .",
    "we have discussed the behavior of the various luminosity  surface brightness diagrams .",
    "we will now quickly explain why these lead to a different behavior for the de and e galaxies in the @xmath21@xmath15 plane .",
    "in this diagram , a break , or change in slope , at @xmath91 is known to exist ( kodaira , okamura , & watanabe 1983 ; binggeli et al .  1984 ; binggeli & cameron 1991 ; capaccioli et al .",
    "modelling elliptical galaxies from the bright end of the luminosity function results in the kormendy ( 1977 ) relation ( e.g. , hoessel , oegerle , & schneider 1987 ; graham 1996 ) , while modelling fainter elliptical galaxies is known to produce a different relation ( e.g. , binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .",
    "the different slopes have been interpreted in the past as evidence for a de / e galaxy dichotomy . however , the difference observed in this diagram need not imply a different formation mechanism .",
    "from the relation @xmath92 , the diagram of @xmath85 versus @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig8]a ) can be used to determine @xmath20 .",
    "one can then immediately understand why diagrams of @xmath15 versus @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig8]g ) show a different trend for the de and e galaxies .",
    "the same explanation applies to the @xmath93 relation .    in conclusion",
    ", there is a continuous structural relation between the alleged de and e galaxy classes until core formation is detected .",
    "the use of @xmath14 or @xmath21 , instead of @xmath5 , and the use of @xmath19 models , has blinded our realization of this for a long time .",
    "this paper provides an analysis of _ hst_-resolved dwarf elliptical galaxies modelled with a srsic function and either a central point source or a resolved central gaussian component .",
    "that is , we have taken full advantage of the _ hst _ resolution and modelled the complete galaxy profiles .",
    "we find that the structure of the de galaxies is consistent with that found from studies which avoided the inner arcsecond ( or three ) .",
    "moreover , the 3-parameter srsic model remains a good description of the _ entire _",
    "( underlying ) host galaxy light - profiles .",
    "three of our initial 18 de galaxy candidates may contain outer disks , or in any case are two component systems ( in addition to possible nucleation ) ; they are all possibly dwarf s0 galaxies .",
    "thirteen of the remaining 15 de galaxies are nucleated . excluding two possible outliers",
    ", we found @xmath3 .",
    "however , our galaxy sample spans only a little over 2 mag in absolute magnitude and hence an increased sample with a greater range of magnitudes would be valuable . despite this , we find strong correlations between @xmath67 and @xmath5 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath67 and @xmath85 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the correlation between the inner , logarithmic profile slope @xmath7 and @xmath85 is explained here as a consequence of the relations between @xmath7 and @xmath67 , and @xmath67 and @xmath85 .",
    "galaxies fainter than @xmath22 have progressively shallower inner profile slopes .    by including 232 e galaxies from the literature , which ( starting at @xmath95 ) span 10 mag in absolute magnitude , we have shown that more luminous elliptical galaxies have brighter central surface brightnesses  until the detection of core formation at @xmath22 .",
    "the linear relationships between magnitude , the logarithm of the profile shape @xmath6 , and the central surface brightness , are used to predict and explain why the low- and high - luminosity elliptical galaxies display a different behavior in diagrams of luminosity versus effective and mean surface brightness .",
    "it has nothing to do with core formation , nor does it imply a different formation mechanism for each galaxy class , as has been the interpretation in the past .",
    "it is instead a natural consequence of the previously mentioned linear relations .",
    "contrary to popular belief , de galaxies appear to be the low - luminosity extension of brighter e galaxies ; there is no physical boundary at @xmath16 .",
    "the smooth and continuous change in these galaxy s structural properties suggests that a similar physical process , or processes , have governed the evolution of the entire de + e galaxy family  with the notable departure of only the most luminous ellipticals from the @xmath85@xmath5 diagram at @xmath22 . with this exception in mind , the mechanism of how de and e galaxies collapsed to form stars",
    "is therefore expected to be similar .",
    "simulations of elliptical galaxy catalogs which have used only @xmath19 models do not represent the real galaxy population in our universe .",
    "similarly , @xmath96-body merger models which finish with galaxies having a range of luminosities but with structural homology ( e.g. , all with @xmath19 profiles ) , have also not reproduced what is observed in nature .",
    "it would be of great interest to re - examine whether the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies simulated in an hierarchial clustering cosmology ( e.g.  cole et al .",
    "2000 ) display a range of profile shapes which vary with galaxy luminosity .",
    "additionally , observational work which has _ a priori _ assumed all galaxies can be approximated with either an exponential surface brightness profile ( e.g. , shao et al .",
    "2003 ) , or with an @xmath19 profile ( e.g. , bernardi et al .",
    "2003a , b)-model minus data ) residual profiles in bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ; their figure 7 ) clearly show deviations from the @xmath19-model which can be well matched using an @xmath0 model .",
    "] will certainly obtain a luminosity - biased set of surface brightness and galaxy size parameters which can not reproduce the trends observed in , for example , the top panel of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "lastly , models of bright elliptical galaxies built from the merging of elliptical galaxies fainter than @xmath97 must not assume the correlations defined by the brightest elliptical galaxies necessarily apply to the pre - merged galaxies .",
    "unless merger models include the growth and merging of supermassive black holes , or some other mechanism of core depletion , they should predict brighter central surface brightnesses with increasing galaxy luminosity .    we wish to thank ileana vass for her help with the archival _ hst _ images .",
