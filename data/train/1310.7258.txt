    "one of the most intriguing predictions of intense field qed is @xmath0 vacuum pair production .",
    "pair creation in a constant electric field would become observable when the field strength reaches @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "attaining such a field strength with a constant electric field is an extremely difficult task , so it is more reasonable to use alternating , e.g. laser fields .",
    "current progress in technologies brings hopes on attaining laser fields close to @xmath2 under the laboratory conditions .",
    "intensities about @xmath3 can be already obtained nowadays @xcite , and there exist projects proposing further ways to achieve even higher intensities up to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "critical field @xmath2 corresponds to laser intensity @xmath5 , but combining of two or more head - on colliding focused laser pulses allows to reduce the threshold intensity required for observation of pair creation down to @xmath6 @xcite . in such schemes of experiments the laser field",
    "is often supposed to be in optical range , but it seems reasonable to take into account a situation of counterpropagating pulses with arbitrary frequencies , e.g. , collision of an optical pulse with coherent hard x - ray or @xmath7-ray pulses as proposed in @xcite .",
    "such coherent pulses could be obtained by different ways : by using a free - electron laser ( nowadays one may think of the parameters of xfel @xcite ) , or rather by using some novel technologies of compression , e.g. the relativistic flying mirror concept @xcite ( see @xcite for a brief review ) .    in a most general case one may consider short high - frequency pulses of arbitrary intensity .",
    "next it is important to choose the appropriate theoretical approach for dealing with such pulses . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we can consider the optical laser field to a high precision as an external classical field , e.g. a plane wave , due to a great number of coherent soft photons it contains .",
    "then , to consider the problem accurately , one should consider a short high - frequency pulse interacting with that optical field as a bunch of coherent photons , so that any number ( few or many ) of photons from such a pulse can contribute to the process of pair formation . in other words , one should consider the problem fully quantum mechanically with respect to the short high - frequency pulse , but such a general approach as for now can not be implemented explicitly for technical reasons . summarizing the existing methods that we list and discuss below , as for",
    "now one can consider the short high - frequency pulse either as a bunch of individual ( non - coherent ) photons , i.e. take into account only diagrams involving a single hard photon and any number of soft optical photons , or , if the density of hard photons is large , as another external classical field , e.g. , a counterpropagating plane wave .",
    "such two conceivable ways of consideration of short high - frequency pulse have their own benefits and limitations .",
    "the total probability of pair production in different field configurations can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless invariant parameters .",

    "the approaches that we mention do not cover the whole region of the parameters of interest , so that some novel methods are needed in the currently unexplorable domains . in order to understand better matching between",
    "the two above mentioned complementary descriptions of a short high - frequency pulse in calculation of the pair production probability we present some unifying estimates based on the quasiclassical method .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - exact ] we introduce a toy model which involves an idealized ultra - short pulse of electromagnetic radiation with the field strength described by a delta - function propagating opposite to the constant crossed field , the latter corresponds to the optical laser field , so that pairs are created solely in the region of an overlap . for the sake of simplicity we consider production of scalar particles , but this should not change principally the behaviour of the pair creation probability as compared to the case of fermion particles . in this paper",
    "we derive the exact analytical expression for the number of created pairs for arbitrary values of the classical non - linearity parameter of the ultra - short pulse , and this is the most remarkable feature of the toy model .",

    "@xmath20 , in such a reference frame that @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively , if one prefers to describe the short pulse as a bunch of individual photons with energy @xmath22 , propagating in the external field @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , then the probability of pair creation would depend on the following set of invariant parameters @xcite : @xmath25 the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the classical non - linearity parameters and are proportional to the square roots of the photon densities .",

    "if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then both @xmath23 and @xmath41 may be treated classically and the resulting field can be considered locally constant and homogeneous @xcite .",
    "this approach is fully non - perturbative and takes into account absorption of great number of photons from _ both _ fields during the process of pair creation . in this case probability",
    "is determined mainly by the field strength and not by the field frequencies , so that the case of high frequencies can not be treated in an appropriate way .",
    "this approximation is limited by a value of field inhomogeneity , so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a characteristic size of variation of the field and @xmath44 is the electron compton length .",
    "@xmath43 is related to the frequency of a field , so that frequencies @xmath45 are prohibited within such an approach .    assuming the short pulse to be a bunch of high - frequency non - coherent photons , in order to find the number of created pairs one should calculate the probability of pair photoproduction in a strong external field .",
    "the case of pair photoproduction by photons of arbitrary frequencies in the plane wave @xmath23 was well studied in @xcite . that approach was perturbative with respect to high - frequency pulse , since only diagrams with a single hard photon line were taken into account for the process . to obtain a total pair production rate ,",
    "the probability of pair photoproduction by a single photon must be multiplied by the density @xmath46 of hard photons , and after that integrated over the region of overlapping of the beams .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath35 in this case may be arbitrary , but due to perturbative ( in the abovementioned sense ) treatment @xmath47 . if @xmath32 , then @xmath23 becomes a constant crossed field @xcite , such a case is rather convenient to study the dependency of the probability on @xmath35 : @xmath48 pair creation by a photon in a constant electromagnetic field is also well studied using the expressions for imaginary part of polarization operator in constant and homogeneous electric field @xcite , as well as in constant and homogeneous electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , such an approach can hardly be repeated for a process involving larger number of photons from @xmath41 , partially due to rapid increasing of complexity of the resulting expressions ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) , and partially due to a less direct relation between the loop diagrams with higher number of external legs and the total pair creation probability via the optical theorem .",
    "there is yet another approach to the problem originally developed in @xcite and based on a quasiclassical approximation .",
    "it can handle both perturbative and non - perturbative regimes , but is valid still only for the case of low frequencies @xmath49 .    obviously , in order to put different approaches together and discuss them on unified grounds , an important issue would be establishing the complete set of relevant parameters for the problem .",
    "let us choose @xmath27 and @xmath35 as the main parameters .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , assume a particular case of polarization of the pulses @xmath23 and @xmath41 , such that the electric and magnetic fields of the two waves interfere constructively and destructively , respectively .",
    "then the parameters ( [ eps - eta ] ) can be expressed in terms of ( [ a - kappa ] ) , namely @xmath50 now it becomes possible to dispose the domains of applicability of each of the approaches at the same diagram in the plane @xmath51 ( see fig .",

    "one can see that the strip @xmath54 , which for photon energies in the range of hard x - rays or @xmath7-rays corresponds to a rather intense field , is not covered by any of the existing approaches , so that there is no model connecting together these approaches .",
    "also , the region of @xmath52 and @xmath55 is not described appropriately ",
    "it is about the super - critical fields @xmath56 , which are seemingly non - physical @xcite , and generally anyway requires taking the backreaction of the created electron - positron plasma into account .        in this paper",

    "more sophisticated derivations of this result based on the explicit expression for polarisation operator in a plane wave field @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "after we have carried out the estimation ( [ w - electric ] ) , let us come back to a more complicated case of our primary interest , i.e. to two counterpropagating pulses .",

    "thus the denominator in the exponential is defined by the largest of the two parameters @xmath67 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is actually the reason why harder pulses ( with @xmath99 ) can stimulate pair production .",
    "one can see that the actual asymptotic expression actually depends on the ratio of non - linearity parameter @xmath27 and the quantum dynamical parameter @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , the locally constant field approximation is valid as long as @xmath100 ( besides the other requirements formulated above ) .",
    "of course , our oversimplified consideration is not capable for calculation of a preexponential factor , which must also be a function of the invariant parameters .",
    "as was shown in the preceding section , there exists a region on the plane of parameters @xmath101 for the problem of pair creation by a collision of electromagnetic pulses , for which none of the yet proposed approaches capable of explicit quantitative calculation of the number of created pairs can be applied . on the one hand , to the best of our knowledge exact solutions for such a setup have been lacking . on the other hand ,",

    "one can equate the classical field to the general expression for the operator of electromagnetic field in qed : @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the photon momentum , @xmath225 is the polarization vector and @xmath226 are the weights of the modes ( in qed , photon annihilation operators ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) , we can derive @xmath226 required for the chosen field @xmath227 @xmath228 accordingly , the photon spectrum is of the form @xmath229 by substituting ( [ spectrum ] ) into ( [ npar ] ) and passing to the new integration variable @xmath230 , we obtain @xmath231 after swapping the order of integrations , the integral over @xmath29 is computed easily , @xmath232 using the formula @xmath233 , we finally obtain the total number of pairs @xmath234 which exactly coincides with the corresponding limiting case in ( [ delta - limits ] ) . in other words , in the limit @xmath47 the exact solution ( [ numpairsdelta ] ) describes pair creation by a dilute photon gas in external constant crossed field , according to the first order of perturbation theory with respect to @xmath7-pulse .",
    "the number of pairs created is proportional to the average number of photons in the `` hard '' pulse @xmath235 , which is rather understandable .",
    "now let us pass to the limiting case @xmath236 . in this case ,",
    "let us try the locally constant field approximation , which means that the resulting field of superposition of both pulses is assumed to be nearly constant at the neighbourhood of each spatial point . in this approximation ,",
    "the number of scalar pairs can be computed as follows @xcite @xmath237 } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{\\varepsilon(z , t)}\\right).\\ ] ] in our case , the invariant parameter @xmath238 , so that @xmath239 if we substitute @xmath240 and take into account that @xmath241 and @xmath242 , then we have @xmath243 note that surprisingly the functional dependence on the parameters of the field here is the same as for the limiting case @xmath52 in ( [ delta - limits ] ) .",
    "however , there remains some difference in a numerical coefficient : in the locally constant field approximation it is @xmath244 instead of @xmath245 in ( [ delta - limits ] ) .",
    "of course , this should not be regarded a problem , because the locally constant field approximation can not be supposed to be accurate for our model with a delta - pulse .",
    "the problem of pair creation by external electromagnetic field of two counterpropagating plane wave pulses is of great interest for planning or discussing experiments but generally does not admit exact analytical solutions . if both pulses are optical and strong ( @xmath246 ) , then quantitative estimates of pair creation can be satisfactorily obtained by applying the locally constant field approximation @xcite . but an even more interesting setup would be a collision of an ultra - strong optical laser pulse with an ultra - short pulse .",
    "the latter is composed of high - frequency photons and , as is widely expected @xcite , pair creation could benefit from it .",
    "if @xmath57 , then the ultra - short pulse can be well considered as a dilute gas of individual mutually incoherent hard photons , and the problem can be solved perturbatively with respect to its field .",
    "however , there is a problem with the transient region ( @xmath247 ) , where the only currently available approach is the imaginary time method , but the latter is capable for analytical quantitative results only if the spatial variation of the field is completely ignored , which seems to be not a reasonable assumption .    in the present paper",
    "we first of all demonstrate how to obtain the already known formulas ( [ w - electric - l ] ) , ( [ w - electric ] ) for pair photoproduction in a constant electric field in a rather simple way by a sort of quasiclassical method .",
    "it turns out that the structure of the exponential factor in the probability of pair photoproduction can be understood almost as simply as that of the exponential factor in the probability of vacuum pair production .",
    "these results can be readily generalized to the case of pair production by a photon in an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field ( though , for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to a simpler case @xmath238 ) .",
    "we also discuss a conjecture on how to extend the area of applicability of these formulas to a more realistic setup with two counterpropagating pulses , at least without aiming to compute a preexponential factor , by proceeding in a spirit of the mean - field approach .",
    "namely , it may occur reasonable to take into account the variation of the field of the `` hard '' pulse by picking out a single representative hard photon from it and consideration of probability of pair photoproduction of this photon in a total ( `` mean '' ) field of superposition of the two pulses , which is assumed constant .",
    "intuitively , this would correspond to a first term in a virial expansion of the probability in powers of @xmath102 .",
    "the results of this part confirm the widely discussed expectations that usage of `` hard '' pulses ( i.e. , combining the high - power with high frequency lasers ) may enlarge the pair production yield .",
    "besides , we introduce a new type of exactly solvable models for pair creation , with one of the colliding pulses been represented by a delta - pulse . in this case , pairs are created exclusively inside the overlap region ( i.e. , inside the delta - pulse ) , so that it becomes possible to identify the in- and out - regions and to obtain explicitly the bogolubov transformation connecting the in- and out- creation and annihilation operators of a charged field . in this particular case ,",
    "the bogolubov transformation arises as a matching condition at a surface of the wave front of the delta - pulse .",
    "of course , the models with a delta - pulse can be hardly applied directly to estimates relevant for realistic experimental setup , because they correspond to an infinite ( supercritical ) field strength inside a `` hard '' pulse and , as a result , the most important factor of the probability  the tunneling exponential suppression factor  is lacking at all .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath102 can be redefined for this case and dependence on it ( unlike the other known approaches ) can be traced exactly .",
    "we hope that this goal ( as well as the whole structure of the bogolubov transformation , which turns out to be rather non - trivial ) will give some further clues on the nature of non - perturbative regime of pair production . in the current paper , we restrict ourselves just to discussion of the main features of the resulting expressions .    one of the features of the result is that the pair production rate is proportional to the mean number of photons @xmath248 in a delta - pulse ( equivalently , intensity , or photon density ) only in the limit @xmath57 , which can be also considered perturbatively with respect to the field of a delta - pulse .",
    "the opposite limiting case @xmath249 , in a sense , corresponds to the locally constant field approximation , although it can be hardly supposed to be valid literally for non - continues fields . in this regime , @xmath250 , which may resemble a spread of the poisson distribution ( as is well known",
    ", the classical external field corresponds to coherent states of the quantum field , which possess poissonian statistics ) .",
    "since this regime is non - perturbative with respect to a delta - pulse , a possible explanation is as follows : during a pair creation process some of the `` hard '' photons are absorbed and some are emitted , but harder photons are mostly absorbed while softer photons are mostly emitted , so that the net number of absorbed photons is proportional to the spread of the photon energy distribution .",
    "but maybe this result should be explained more accurately .    in this paper",
    "we elucidated pair creation in a model with a delta - pulse in a simplest situation  we considered creation of scalar pairs , in a collision of a constant crossed field with a single linearly polarized delta - pulse .",
    "however , the model maintains exact solubility with many generalizations , e.g. for fermion instead of scalar pair production , with a replacement of a single delta - pulse by trains of arbitrarily polarized delta - pulses and of a constant crossed field by an arbitrary plane wave field .",
    "generalization to the case of inclined collision seems to be also possible .",
    "we believe that further development of this approach will be useful for understanding of some aspects of non - perturbative regime of qft .",
