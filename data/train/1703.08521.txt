    "the standard cosmological paradigm states that the universe evolves from a decelerated to an accelerated phase at late times .",
    "the evidence of this cosmic acceleration ( ca ) comes not only from type ia supernova ( snia ) @xcite , but also from several other cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to explain this feature of the universe : one is to modify the right hand side of einstein s equation by assuming the existence of an energy source , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , that produces these effects , and the other is to modify the left hand side by modifying the gravity theory @xcite .",
    "the main property of the de source that generates the ca is an equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath8 , which is the ratio between its pressure and energy density . when @xmath9 we obtain the well - known cosmological constant , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 cold dark matter ( @xmath10cdm ) model satisfactorily explains the ca .",
    "however it presents several unsolved problems , i.e. , the 120 orders of magnitude between the quantum field theory prediction and the cosmological measurements and why the de density is similar to that of dark matter ( dm ) today @xcite .",
    "additionally , the increase in number and precision of cosmological observations has allowed confronting and explore beyond the standard @xmath10cdm @xcite .",
    "one of the methods used to explore departures from the @xmath10cdm model is to assume a redshift dependent eos parameter @xmath7 , given by a suitable parameterization .",
    "the most used parameterization for @xmath7 is the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) ansatz @xcite that expands @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the present value of the eos and @xmath13 is its derivative with respect to redshift .",
    "an intriguing feature emerges once the cpl function for @xmath7 is used with snia .",
    "@xcite found evidence of a low redshift transition of the reconstructed deceleration parameter @xmath14 , the so called slowing down of the ca , that shows a turn around at @xmath15 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have found that such a feature does not only appear with snia but also with gas mass fraction ( @xmath0 ) data in clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another curious behavior emerges when the high redshift data sets are taken into account ( as cosmic microwave background radiation , cmb , or baryon acoustic oscillations , bao ) : the transition feature at low redshift disappears , making it consistent with the @xmath10cdm model @xcite .",
    "then , the key point is to separate the low redshift and high redshift data to study this effect .",
    "@xcite investigated this trend in @xmath14 for five different eos parameterizations using also four snia data sets ; the constitution @xcite , union @xmath16 @xcite , union @xmath17 @xcite and lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) @xcite snia samples .",
    "they found that , using only snia data , the acceleration of the universe seems to have already peaked and it is evolving towards lower rates of acceleration . this result is independent of the eos parameterization used and it is observed in the constitution , union @xmath16 and loss data sets . however , this behavior disappears when the union @xmath17 sample is used .",
    "as in previous studies , if the cosmological observations at high redshift are included in the analysis , the results change @xmath14 from a decelerated to an accelerated phase , very similar to the case of the cosmological constant .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a similar analysis for several @xmath7 functions using the latest cosmological data from snia , cmb and bao .",
    "as in @xcite , the authors confirm that the evolution of ca is independent of the eos parameterization .",
    "in addition , they found that the legacy survey ( snls@xmath18 , * ? ? ? * ) snia data favors the slowing down of the ca while the joint light - curve analysis ( jla , * ? ? ? * ) sample prefers an eternal ca .",
    "they also shown that the effects of different bao data on ca are negligible . by revisiting the role of the spatial curvature",
    ", @xcite found that a non - flat universe prefers a slowing down of the ca .",
    "this result is consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "an interesting result is that the planck 2015 data @xcite favored the slowing down of the ca , while in previous works , this trend disappears when the cmb data is taken into account in the analysis .",
    "here we are interested in testing the transition in the cosmic acceleration as well as the possibility of the slowing down in the acceleration for dynamical de with a @xmath7 parameterization using galaxy clusters observations .",
    "several authors have addressed that the gas mass fraction measurements in galaxy clusters can be used to put constraints on cosmological models @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 data constitute a complementary geometric method to constrain the parameter space of the same eos parameterizations studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the cosmological framework for a flat universe case . in section  [ sec : models ] we present the @xmath7 parameterizations . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the methodology and data used to constrain the parameters of the models . in section  [ sec : results ] we present and discuss the results",

    "our results are in good agreement with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "they found that in the jbp , ba and fsll parameterizations the cosmic acceleration presents a slowing down at @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 respectively within the @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , we calculated the akaike information criteria ( aic , * ? ? ? * ) and bayesian information criteria ( bic , * ? ? ? * ) for the @xmath10cdm and the five dynamical de models . by comparing with the @xmath10cdm",
    ", we obtained that the dynamical models lead larger aics ( @xmath220 ) and bics ( @xmath221 ) values , indicating that a dynamical de model is not necessary to explain the @xmath0 data .",
    "( this result is similar to that obtained by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since that the slowing down of cosmic acceleration depend on the @xmath222 values , which are completely degenerated , it is crucial to provide narrow eos constraints to prevent misleading results .",
    "a future increase in @xmath0 points ( i.e. decrease in the systematic uncertainties ) will produce a better parameter estimation for @xmath7 parameterizations .",
    "for instance , @xcite simulated the @xmath0 measurements for @xmath223 galaxy clusters and obtained for an evolving de model an increase in the figure - of - merit ( fom ) by a factor @xmath224 in an optimistic scenario of future surveys ( this implies a reduction of the area enclosed by the @xmath222 @xmath205 confidence contour and the eos constraints are very close to the cosmological constant )",
    ". therefore the slowing down of cosmic acceleration obtained from @xmath0 constraints could be only a statistical fluctuation .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath187bao@xmath188wmap constraints are used to reconstruct @xmath14 , we found that it evolves similarly to that of the cosmological constant .",
    "when we used the estimations obtained with the joint analysis of the all data , the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase occurs at @xmath225 and @xmath226 at @xmath227 , i.e. , the slowing down of the ca disappears , and it evolves as the cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , we found that the evolution of the ca is independent of the eos parameterization ( see the different panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : qz ] ) .",
    "this same scenario was found by @xcite when several snia data sets are considered ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although to discern which model is the preferred one by observations is not the scope of this paper , it can be determined by comparing the @xmath228 , given in tables [ tab : jbp]-c5 , among data sets .",
    "any @xmath7 parametrization could be plausible to model a dynamical dark energy ."
