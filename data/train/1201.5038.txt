    "this approach is more powerful than measuring the number of counts in fixed energy bands ( as is done when using hardness ratios ) , as the errors on the diagnostic are less sensitive to the underlying spectral shape .",

    "in fact , after accounting for the extinction derived from @xmath18 , the location of cbs 19 in the nir color - color diagram ( fig .

    "as the x - ray spectral properties of cbs 7 do not vary with count rate , the dips are likely not caused by a variation of the local amount of absorbing material .",
    "it is not uncommon for magnetic cvs to be internally absorbed , which can cause our distance and @xmath116 estimates to be overestimated .",
    "traditionally , symbiotic binaries were thought of as soft x - ray emitters .",
    "this picture was mostly based on _ rosat _ observations that were limited by its soft response @xcite .",
    "recently , an increasing number of symbiotics has been detected at harder energies @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that for rtcru , tcrb , cd@xmath657 3057 , and chcyg the hard x - rays are thermal and come from an accretion - disk boundary layer around a massive , non - magnetic white dwarf .",
    "the potentially high white - dwarf masses makes them interesting as candidate sn  ia progenitors .",
    "cbs17 could be a member of this class of `` hard '' symbiotics .",
    "besides the hard spectrum , similarities with this class include the weak optical emission lines and possibly an internal absorption component .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis suggests that the long - term variability is not caused by variations in the column density , whereas in the systems discussed by @xcite the variations were found to result from variations in the intrinsic absorption .      unlike earlier - type",
    "m stars that have a radiative core and convective envelope , ultracool dwarfs are fully convective with cool and effectively neutral atmospheres .",
    "multi - wavelength diagnostics indeed mark a change in magnetic activity around spectral type m7 , but a larger sample is needed to get a clearer picture : only 12 ultracool dwarfs have been detected in x - rays @xcite . in this context , it is important to establish the nature of cbs 14 .",
    "its colors place it between the m9 and l0 dwarfs .",
    "so far , there is no firm x - ray detection of a dwarf later than m9 ; the l2-dwarf kelu-1 with a marginal detection of 4 photons is the only possible exception @xcite . with @xmath117 ( averaged over the observation , for a spectral type m9 ) and a duration of at least 8 ks , cbs 14",
    "could have been caught during one of the strongest flares seen in ultracool dwarfs .",
    "the upper limit on the quiesent luminosity from the _ xmm - newton _ data is @xmath118 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.38 kev ) .",

    "we assume a @xmath121 power - law spectrum and a column density equal to the integrated galactic @xmath23 along the line of sight .",
    "we do this for each of the 63 observations that we searched for bright sources ; the values for the observations analyzed here are included in column 10 of table  [ x - sample - table ] .",
    "the average flux limit of an observation is higher than the value thus computed as the sensitivity decreases with offset angle from the aimpoint . as a first - order correction for the vignetting",
    ", we multiply the flux limits for the aimpoint by the ratio of the value of the exposure map at the aimpoint and the mode of the exposure map .",
    "this gives a correction factor of 1.09 for acis - s , and of 1.0425% higher for far off - axis ( @xmath1210 ) acis - i detections , depending on the spectrum of a source .",
    "] for acis - i .",
    "we find that the number of agns predicted is rather uncertain .",
    "the @xmath122 curves ( 0.38 kev ) from @xcite predict a total of 1957 agns , where the range is defined by the @xmath123 error margins in the parameters of the @xmath122 equation .",
    "if we use the extinction maps from @xcite , which on average predict a higher integrated galactic column density , the number of expected agns is 1342 . in fact , we have 1 confirmed agn and 6 candidate agns (  [ results_agn ] ,  [ results_unknown ] ) . however , if we take into account statistical errors ( which are not included in the ranges given above ) , and the possibility that the galactic extinction is still underestimated ( neither the drimmel nor the schlegel extinction models has been verified externally in an extensive way ) , the predicted and observed number of agns are not so discrepant as they might seem at first sight . in any case , it is likely that most of the sources in  [ results_unknown ] are indeed agns .      using our classifications to separate the galactic sources in our sample from the extra - galactic sources ( including the six agn candidates ) ,",
    "we have computed the cumulative source density versus flux for the galactic sources only .",
    "we do this by adding up the contribution of each source and normalizing it by the area in which it could have been detected based on the flux limits of each of the 63 observations searched . as in this case",
    "we only consider galactic sources , we have used a different spectral model to calculate the flux limits than in  [ disc_agn ] . to account for the typically softer spectra of the galactic sources ( see  table  [ spectral - param ] )",
    ", we use a power law with photon index @xmath124 and correct for only 25% of the integrated @xmath23 along the line of sight .",
    "this value of @xmath21 is only appropriate for coronal sources , but we find that @xmath121 and correcting for the total integrated @xmath23 give the same results .",

    "the nine sources below this limit are all likely late - type active stars .",
    "we do not have enough statistics to do a detailed analysis , but can make a qualitative statement .",
    "the slope @xmath63 of the curve @xmath126 appears flatter than the slope for an isotropic distribution ( @xmath127 ) that is expected for a truly homogenous angular distribution like that of agns , or for a population of local sources that is sufficiently close as to seem isotropic .",
    "the slope is closer to the value expected for a disk distribution ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the derived distances indeed place our galactic sources up to 35 kpc away ( table  [ flux - dist - lum ] ) .",
    "other galactic plane surveys find a similar flattening of the galactic @xmath122 distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which for the xgps is mostly accounted for by soft stellar coronal sources @xcite .",

    "chandra _ have detected our sources if they were located in the central bulge , and if so , can we use them as templates to constrain the nature of more distant obscured sources ?",
    "we answer this question for the specific case of the 10  @xmath81 10  region around sgr a*the galactic center region or gcr  where _ chandra _ found a large number ( thousands ) of x - ray point sources , most of which remain unidentified at other wavelengths .",
    "we apply the canonical extinction for the gcr of @xmath132 @xmath3 to our intrinsic source fluxes , and put them at a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "the deep pointings of the sgr a * field reach a sensitivity of at least @xmath133 erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 ( @xmath134 between 28 kev for 700 ks of stacked exposures ; @xcite ) .",
    "all ( candidate ) agns except cbs 2 , the two ( likely ) galactic accretion - powered sources cbs 7 and cbs 17 , and the rscvn binary cbs 8 would fall above this x - ray limit .",
    "only two sources would be bright enough in the nir to be detectable in our gcr @xmath135 band observations @xcite , viz .",
    "cbs 8 and cbs 17 . with @xmath136 and 14.1 ,",
    "respectively , they would lie above the confusion limit of @xmath137 in most of the region , and @xmath138 in the most crowded region within 1  of sgr a*. with higher - resolution images , obtainable with ao imaging , they would be easily detectable",
    ". however , as their spectra do not show strong signatures of activity or accretion ( not in the optical , at least ) , it is difficult to distinguish them from the random coincidences with late - type evolved stars , which abound in the old bulge . while @xcite showed that at most 10% of the unidentified sources around sgr a * have such bright counterparts , it is important to recognize that it is not only young wind - fed quiescent be - hmxbs , which have received much of the focus so far , that contribute to this nir `` bright '' population of x - ray sources , but also active binaries of the rscvn - type and symbiotic binaries .",
    "the present work is limited to a small sample of bright sources , but has uncovered a number of interesting systems that are worth detailed follow - up .",
    "some of it is already underway .",
    "@xcite present the results of an optical / nir study of cbs 7 , and optical spectroscopy to establish the nature of cbs 14 is planned .",
    "an extension of this work to the entire champlane database , which is almost 3 orders of magnitude larger , is guaranteed to find more individual sources of interest .",
    "it also allows us to construct deeper @xmath122 curves in distinct sections of the plane with enough statistics to investigate differences in density and distribution of various types ( accreting versus non - accreting ) of faint galactic x - ray sources , and can contribute to our understanding of the composition of the resolved part of the galactic ridge .",
