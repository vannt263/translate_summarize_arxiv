    "the standard core - accretion model generally treats planet formation as occurring in two stages @xcite : in the first stage , mountain - sized planetesimals form from small dust grains embedded in a gas - rich protoplanetary disk @xcite , and then in the second stage these planetesimals go on to accrete one another to form planetary embryos @xcite which eventually go on to merge into full planets @xcite .",
    "the first stage - planetesimal formation - is of crucial importance , as it sets the initial conditions upon which subsequent stages of evolution depend .",
    "however , the details of planetesimal formation are still poorly understood and remain somewhat controversial .    one model for the formation of planetesimals",
    "envisages them growing via mutual sticking collisions @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments show that @xmath4 m sized dust grains can stick together efficiently through various surface forces , including the van der waals and electrostatic forces , causing them to form mm to cm - sized aggregates @xcite . beyond this mm to cm range , particles become less sticky while their gravitational interactions remain weak , leading to collisional disruption rather than growth @xcite . furthermore",
    ", cm to m sized objects begin to decouple from the gas , so that they experience collisions with higher relative velocities and also begin to experience significant aerodynamic drag which causes them to quickly spiral into the protostar on a timescale of a few hundred orbital periods @xcite  the well - known  meter - barrier \" .",
    "an alternative scenario that has been suggested to try and circumvent this meter - barrier , envisages that the km - sized planetesimals form directly via gravitational instabilities in a dense particle sub - disk near the mid - plane of the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that even low levels of turbulence would prevent solids from settling down to a sufficiently dense mid - plane layer @xcite .",
    "recently breakthroughs have been made in both scenarios .",
    "for the collisional scenario , @xcite found in experiments that high - velocity ( tens of @xmath5 ) collisions between small dust particles ( @xmath6 ) and a pre - planetesimal body ( @xmath7 ) can lead to efficient growth , suggesting that some  lucky \" pre - planetesimals may escape from erosive collisions and go on to form km - sized planetesimals @xcite .",
    "for the instability scenario , it is found that turbulence can act to concentrate dust , thus providing a high density , low velocity dispersion environment in which planetesimals may form via various models of instability @xcite .",
    "the planetesimals formed in these new turbulent models can be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than those formed in traditional models .",
    "planetesimal formation is thus far from being completely understood and current models are a work - in - progress .",
    "however , a point worth mentioning is that none of these different scenarios ensure that all planetesimals appear at the same time at a given location .",
    "in fact , any model which requires non - global density enhancements to form planetesimals , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , implicitly assumes that certain regions of the disk will form planetesimals first , while the rest of the disk remains  dusty \" .",
    "furthermore , two recent studies by @xcite and @xcite argue that , for the turbulent concentration scenario , planet formation efficiency ( set by the probability for turbulently - formed clumps of mm - sized grains to collapse into planetesimals ) could be relatively low , depending on the values of several crucial parameters such as the dust - to - gas density ratio , disk viscosity , density and profile .",
    "this means that , at a given location in the disk , there could be a wide time gap between the moment when the first planetesimals form and the moment when most of the available solid mass has been converted into planetesimals .",
    "there could thus be a long transition period during which individual planetesimals are embedded in a disk where most of the mass of solids is still in small grains .",
    "this issue has tended to be ignored in studies investigating the next stage of planet formation , i.e. , planetesimal accretion .",
    "most of these studies consider a system where all planetesimals are present at time @xmath8 , possibly with a distribution of initial sizes , which then grow by pairwise accretion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are several noteworthy exceptions .",
    "@xcite considered that planetesimals progressively appear over a @xmath9years timescale , but only considered mutual planetesimal accretion as a possible growth mode , implicitly neglecting the contribution of dust .",
    "@xcite , while attempting to fit the known asteroidal size - distribution , did consider in one of their simulations the possible accretion of dust by planetesimals which formed early , but did so only for one specific case : large , 100 km sized seed - planetesimals produced over 2 myr .",
    "in addition , @xcite attempted to model accretion of dust onto planetesimals as well as planetesimal - planetesimal collisions but they started with very large planetesimals .",
    "the most promising study has been recently performed by @xcite , who envisage dust accretion onto planetesimals more explicitly , but restricted to the specific case of a close - in binary , and using only a simplified 2-dimensional model .    in this study",
    ", we plan to take these pioneering studies a step further and investigate in detail planetesimal growth during the transition period when isolated planetesimals and a primordial dust - disk coexist .",
    "we outline a new growth mode , which dominates during this early phase , during which planetesimals experience negligible gravitational or collisional interactions with one another , and grow mainly ( or solely ) via the accretion of dust or ice that they sweep up@xmath10 in the manner of a rolling snowball . in this paper",
    ", we refer to this dust - fueled planetesimal growth phase as the  snowball \" growth phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the snowball growth rate ( growth only by dust accretion ) is derived , using a semi - analytical approach , in @xmath112 .",
    "next , in @xmath113 , we show how long the snowball phase could last and to what radial size and mass fraction the planetesimals can grow via this snowball growth mode .",
    "then , in @xmath114 , the implications for planet formation in both the solar system and in close binary systems are discussed .",
    "finally , we conclude in @xmath115 .",
    "additionally , all variables defined in this paper are listed alphabetically in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we adopt a simplified analytical model which contains only two components : dust and planetesimals . the dust in our model",
    "is assumed to be in the sub - mm to mm size range , as ( 1 ) this is the typical size of chondrules @xcite , and ( 2 ) particles of this approximate size settle down to the mid - plane of the disc on a relative short timescale of @xmath12 yr , and can survive the inward drift for as long as @xmath13 yr @xcite .",
    "_ individual _ planetesimals are assumed to be quickly produced from dust , on a timescale @xmath14 , whether through collisions @xcite or instabilities @xcite .",
    "a reasonable reference value for @xmath14 might be @xmath15 yr @xcite .",
    "however , we do _ not _ restrict our study to @xmath16 yr .",
    "in fact , as we show in section 3 , the precise value of @xmath14 is unimportant to the final results as long as it is not too long ( i.e. @xmath17 , see @xmath113 ) .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that , once formed from the dust , all planetesimals have the same size @xmath18 , which we take as the initial condition for newly - formed planetesimals in our model . to account for the dispersion in times at which planetesimals are created in the system ,",
    "we introduce an efficiency factor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for planetesimal formation at a given location in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we then consider a given radial distance in the disk and define the local planetesimal formation rate as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the surface number density and initial _ individual _ mass of the planetesimals respectively , and @xmath24 is the dust surface density .",
    "further , following @xcite , @xmath25 is the characteristic planetesimal formation timescale defined as @xmath26 the surface number density of planetesimals in the system thus increases linearly according to the relation @xmath27 assuming that @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath25 does _ not _ represent the time it takes for an individual planetesimal to form ( that is @xmath14 ) but rather the time it takes for most of the dust to be converted into planetesimals , as parameterized by the factor @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , this implies that all the planetesimals are created at the same instant .",
    "this should be treated as an idealized or limiting case , and in reality , we expect @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite finds that @xmath25 can easily vary over 10 orders of magnitude , from @xmath34 to @xmath35 yr , depending on local conditions in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "our model , assuming a constant rate of planetesimal creation as well as a single initial planetesimal size , is very simplified .",
    "however , it is accurate enough for the order - of - magnitude approach adopted in this present study and allows us to identify and quantify the snowball phase in a convenient manner .",
    "when a planetesimal is sweeping through a dust disk , the mass growth rate through dust accretion is @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the mass and radii of the planetesimal , @xmath39 is the scale height of the dust - disk , and @xmath40 is the relative velocity between planetesimal and dust .",
    "@xmath41 is a dimensionless coefficient accounting for the efficiency of dust accretion onto planetesimals .",
    "according to @xcite , accretion can be very efficient as long as the dust size is smaller than mm .",
    "hence , throughout this paper , we take a medium value @xmath42 . from eqn.[sweep ] , we can also derive the growth rate in the planetesimal radius as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the planetesimal density and @xmath45 is the scale height of the gas - disk . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath46 and use a protoplanetary disk scaled by the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn , @xcite ) , which gives @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the scaling factor of the disk mass relative to the mmsn , and @xmath50 accounts for the enhancement of solid density beyond the ice line , @xmath51 .",
    "we take @xmath52 if @xmath53 , and @xmath54 otherwise @xcite .",
    "note that in eqn.[sweep ] and eqn.[grate ] , we do not consider the gravitational focusing effect , since dust is well coupled with the gas while the focusing effect is only well applied to 2-body dynamics in which only the gravity of the two objects themselves matters . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath40 is basically the local differential velocity between a large planetesimal and a gas streamline .",
    "assuming an axisymmetric and pressure - supported gas disk , this leads to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the local keplerian velocity at @xmath57 au . substitutinging this into eqn.[grate ] , we get the growth rate in the planetesimals radii due to the direct accretion of dust ,",
    "@xmath58 taking @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we get @xmath61 at 1 au .",
    "it is worth noting from eqn.[grate2 ] that the planetesimal radii follow a linear growth rate . since the planetesimal formation rate",
    "is also assumed linear as shown in eqn.[rate2 ] , then we can derive the mass - weighted average planetesimal radius as ( see appendix for detail ) @xmath62 as well as the planetesimal mass fraction ( pmf ) with respect to the total solid mass , @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two key statistics which trace the typical size and total mass of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "note that , for the growth rate we derive in eqn.[grate2 ] , a constant dust surface density is implicitly assumed .",
    "in reality , dust would be consumed both through the production of new planetesimals and through the growth of planetesimals which formed earlier .",
    "to account for this depletion , we use @xmath65 as an alarm or flag : if @xmath66 , we then understand that a large fraction of dust has been consumed and we turn off planetesimal growth via dust accretion .",
    "as planetesimals begin to populate the disk , they can begin having mutual encounters .",
    "the timescale for the onset of mutual collisions decreases as the number density increases .",
    "assuming equipartition between in - plane and out - of - plane motions , we get @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the volume number density and average relative velocity of the planetesimals , respectively , and @xmath70 is their average orbital inclination .",
    "we define snowball growth as beginning with the formation of the first planetesimal and ending at the point when mutual planetesimal collisions take over as the dominant growth mode , i.e. , when @xmath71 .",
    "if the snowball growth is efficient , i.e. , @xmath72 , then the duration of the snowball phase @xmath73 can be approximately derived as @xmath74 @xmath75 given @xmath73 and using eqn.[rwei ] and eqn.[pmf ] , the mass - weighted size ( @xmath76 ) and the mass fraction of planetesimals ( @xmath77 ) at the end of the snowball growth phase can be estimated as , @xmath78    we wish to emphasise that :    1 .",
    "eqn.[tsnow ] , eqn.[rsnow ] and eqn.[pmfsnow ] are approximate solutions which are valid only if @xmath72 .",
    "when this approximation is invalid ( @xmath79 ) , then @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can not be expressed analytically and numerical solutions are required ( see fig.[figtrsnow ] in  3.3 ) .",
    "2 .   eqn.[tsnow ] and eqn.[rsnow ] depend on @xmath25 ( not @xmath14 ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath80 yr appearing in eqn.[tsnow ] and eqn.[rsnow ] is _ not _ related to the value @xmath81 yr mentioned in section 2.1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 does not affect the results ( eqn.[tsnow ] , eqn.[rsnow ] and eqn.[pmfsnow ] ) provided that @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath77 is the total @xmath65 at the end of snowball phase , i.e. @xmath82 , it is _ not _ just the @xmath65 contributed _ purely _ by the snowball _ growth _ phase .",
    "( see also in  3.1 and  4.1.1 for details ) 4 .",
    "since @xmath83 is proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath76 actually increases with the disk density .",
    "an efficient snowball growth phase would imply that a significant proportion of the disk s solid - mass is converted into planetesimals in this phase , so one essential condition is that @xmath77 should be close to unity .",
    "let s define this high-@xmath77 condition as corresponding to @xmath84 . from eq.[pmfsnow ] , we see that high @xmath77 fractions are favored by high values of @xmath85 . at @xmath86",
    "au from the star , for instance , @xmath87 requires @xmath88 .",
    "to a first order , @xmath85 is an indicator of the degree of turbulence in the protoplanetary disk ; the larger @xmath85 , the weaker the turbulence .",
    "therefore , snowball growth is more efficient for a disk that has weaker turbulence ( higher value of @xmath85 ) .",
    "this can be simply understood as being the condition that , for the same amount of dust mass , this mass is concentrated in a thinner , denser disk and is thus more easily accreted by planetesimals that always stay very close to the mid - plane .    however , while the above condition is necessary , it is not sufficient .",
    "this is because , according to eqn.[pmf ] ( replacing @xmath38 by @xmath76 and @xmath89 by @xmath73 ) , @xmath77 has contributions from two sources : the snowball growth term @xmath90 , and the initial planetesimal creation term @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of snowball growth should be measured using both @xmath77 and the ratio @xmath92 . in this paper",
    ", we define the criteria for an efficient snowball growth phase as ( 1 ) @xmath93 ( or equivalently , @xmath88 ) , _ and _ ( 2 ) @xmath94 ( or equivalently , @xmath95 ) .",
    "note that although the efficiency of snowball growth decreases with the ratio of @xmath91 , the efficiency actually increases with the absolute value of @xmath73 , since @xmath96 .",
    "as shown in eqn.[pmfsnow ] and discussed in the above subsection , the efficiency of the snowball growth phase depends on the ratio between the gas and dust scale heights ( @xmath85 ) which is an indicator of the degree of disk turbulence .",
    "here we consider three cases with weak ( @xmath97 ) , intermediate ( @xmath98 ) and strong ( @xmath99 ) disk turbulence , which lead respectively to @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 at 1 au in a 1 mmsn disk .",
    "for each case , we then consider two further sub - cases with different characteristic planetesimal formation timescales ( not @xmath14 ) : @xmath103 yr and @xmath104 yr and with the same initial planetesimal size of @xmath105 km .",
    "solving for @xmath106 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 as an explicit function of time ( using eqn.[rwei ] , eqn.[pmf ] and eqn.[tcol ] ) , we plot the results in fig.[figpmf ] .    in fig.[figpmf ] , the locations of the triangles ( @xmath103 yr ) and squares ( @xmath104 yr ) mark the important point at which the system transits from snowball growth to the mutual collision mode . as expected ,",
    "the snowball phase is much more efficient in the weakly turbulent ( high @xmath85 ) case .",
    "additionally , if the initial planetesimal creation process is inefficient ( @xmath104 yr ) , then the snowball phase is longer and planetesimals can grow up to @xmath107 km purely via dust accretion , whereas when the creation process is efficient and @xmath103 yr , the planetesimals can only reach @xmath108 km before mutual collisions take over . at the end of the snowball growth phase ,",
    "both cases have comparable values of @xmath77 ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively ) , both of which are below our alarm value of @xmath111 .",
    "conversely , for the highly turbulent case , snowball growth is less efficient .",
    "although the snowball phase lasts longer than in the low turbulence case , planetesimals do nt grow quickly enough to reach sizes bigger than @xmath112 km ( @xmath103 yr case ) or @xmath113 km ( @xmath104 yr case ) .    in summary , fig.[figpmf ]",
    "demonstrates the general trend that snowball growth is more efficient when ( a ) planetesimal creation rates are lower ( i.e. , larger @xmath25 ) , and ( b ) when disk turbulence is weaker ( i.e. , larger @xmath85 ) . in addition , fig.[figpmf ] provides a method ( by finding the crossing point in the @xmath114 plane ) by which @xmath73 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 can be found more accurately than just using the approximate expressions of eqn.[tsnow ] , eqn.[rsnow ] and eqn.[pmfsnow ] .",
    "the results of  [ secn : examples ] were obtained for a fixed initial planetesimal size of 1 km .",
    "we now extend these results to a more general case in which the initial planetesimal size , @xmath18 , is allowed to vary .",
    "such a consideration is important for two reasons : firstly because @xmath76 does not vary linearly with @xmath18 , and secondly because the initial planetesimal size is a poorly constrained parameter that strongly varies from one planetesimal formation scenario to the other .    for illustrative purposes , we focus here on the most favorable case for snowball growth , i.e. , weak turbulence ( @xmath97 ) , and vary both @xmath18 and @xmath25 as free parameters .",
    "fig.[figtrsnow ] shows @xmath73 and @xmath76 in the @xmath115 plane and was generated by numerically solving the equation @xmath71 . as the values of @xmath73 and @xmath76 plotted in fig.[figtrsnow ] are accurately solved using this numerical method , they do _ not _ rely on the approximation @xmath72 which was assumed in eqn.[tsnow ] and eqn.[rsnow ] .",
    "note that in the bottom - right corner of fig.[figtrsnow ] , the @xmath76 contours become vertical , while the @xmath73 contours become horizontal .",
    "this occurs because we suppress snowball growth whenever the pmf becomes greater than the alarm value 0.5.@xmath116    not surprisingly , snowball growth is at its most efficient in the top part of the figure , where @xmath25 is long ( or equivalently , the planetesimal creation rate is low ) .",
    "in addition , from eqn.[rsnow ] we see that @xmath117 , so that snowball growth , measured in terms of the increase in planetesimal size , is more efficient for smaller initial planetesimals , i.e. on the left - hand side of the plot .",
    "this result should be expected since , for a given total mass of solids , smaller initial sizes lead to larger total collisional cross - section for dust accretion .",
    "in contrast , snowball growth gets less efficient when starting from larger initial planetesimals .",
    "however , even for @xmath118 km , a factor 10 increase in size ( 1000 in mass ) is possible for low - turbulence disks with a low planetesimal formation rate ( @xmath119 yr ) . setting this factor 10 size increase as the criteria for an efficient snowball phase ( see sec.[secn : effi ] )",
    ", we see that the corresponding minimum value for @xmath25 increases from @xmath120 yr for @xmath121 km to @xmath122 yr for @xmath123 km . however , another crucial constraint is that @xmath73 should not exceed the time for disk dispersal ( probably @xmath124 yr ) .",
    "this constraint is relevant for the following considerations : if gas is dissipated , then ( 1 ) both dust and planetesimals would have keplerian velocities , and there would thus be far less efficient dust - sweeping and no snowball growth for planetesimals , and ( 2 ) one would like to be able to form gas giants such as jupiter in the solar system , and hence require that massive solid planetary cores be able to form before disk dissipation . given this additional constraint , all the solutions in the top - right part of fig.[figtrsnow ] are ruled out .",
    "a factor 10 size increase in less than @xmath125 yr is thus only possible for @xmath126 km .",
    "we emphasize that this current section of discussion (  [ secn : ss ] ) is based on the results of fig.[figtrsnow ] for the weak turbulence case where snowball growth is most favorable .",
    "it is worth noting that in fig.[figtrsnow ] we always have @xmath128 . as a consequence , in this case",
    "@xmath73 can be interpreted as corresponding approximately to the typical timescale , @xmath127 , for which the solid disk goes from being dust - dominated to being planetesimal - dominated .",
    "this timescale is especially relevant for planet formation scenarios because it can be independently measured , through both protoplanetary disk observations @xcite and meteoritic evidence in our solar system @xcite .",
    "all these observational studies seem to agree on a transition timescale somewhere between 1 and 10myr , i.e. , @xmath116 yr , which is shown as the red region in fig.[figtrsnow ] .",
    "further , we note that if @xmath129 then @xmath130 whereas if @xmath131 then @xmath132 these relations occur because snowball growth implicitly includes two simultaneous processes , i.e. the formation of new planetesimals , plus the snowball growth of new planetesimals . as discussed in  3.1 , snowball _ growth _ dominates the snowball phase only if @xmath133 .",
    "this requires @xmath134 km for the red region of fig.[figtrsnow ] .",
    "in contrast to the above , if @xmath135 then @xmath136 taking into account all these considerations , one should take care _ not _ to confuse @xmath25 with either @xmath73 or @xmath127 , as it may potentially be orders of magnitude different from either .",
    "irrespective of the precise scenario in question , we note that snowball growth provides an alternative channel through which dust can be converted into planetesimals .",
    "moreover this can be an efficient process ; even if the initial planetesimal _ creation _ is very inefficient , one can still convert most of the solid mass into planetesimal within 1 - 10 myr .      following the previous chapter ,",
    "we take as a reference the observationally derived constraint of @xmath137 and the additional result that , for the weak turbulence case , @xmath138 . as a consequence , the most probable location for the dust - to - planetesimal",
    "transition is the red region of fig.[figtrsnow ] .",
    "an important feature is that almost the whole of this red region corresponds to a @xmath139 km range .",
    "this implies that , for the weak turbulent case , mutual planetesimal - planetesimal collisions ( or planetesimal accretion ) start when planetesimals are 100 - 1000 km in radii , _ regardless of their initial size @xmath18_.    interestingly , this implication is consistent with the result of a recent study by @xcite , which found that the size - distribution of asteroids in the solar system , in particular the knee in this distribution around 100 km , could be well reproduced if planetesimal accretion ( and mutual fragmentation ) starts from 100 - 1000 km - sized objects .",
    "this was interpreted by @xcite as being an indication that asteroids were born big , i.e. , they emerge from their dust - to - pebbles progenitors with a size exceeding 100 km .",
    "we argue that our results could provide an alternative explanation , i.e. , that 100 to 1000 km is the characteristic size for the end of snowball growth and the onset of mutual collisions , a size that might be much larger than the size @xmath18 of the initial seed planetesimals .",
    "in other words , the results of morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) could actually provide some supporting evidence for the snowball growth , since the result @xmath140 km is robust when applying the snowball concept to parameters consistent with the solar system .",
    "however , this inference depends on whether the weak turbulence case is consistent with the solar system .    as mentioned in @xmath1411 , a form of snowball growth",
    "was taken into account in the simulations of @xcite ( see their fig.6b ) .",
    "however , there are important differences between their work and this present study .",
    "first of all , dust sweeping was only considered for large ( @xmath142 km ) seed planetesimals , implicitly neglecting its possible effect on smaller initial bodies .",
    "another , perhaps more important difference lies in the respective models adopted for dust sweeping .",
    "@xcite argue that it proceeds in a fast `` runaway '' mode  thus making it end much earlier  because the relative velocity between the planetesimals and the dust ( @xmath143 ) is smaller than the planetesimals escape velocity ( @xmath144 for a 100 km size ) , and hence the dust is gravitationally focused onto the larger planetesimals . in this study",
    "we ignore runaway growth , even for large planetesimals , because we implicitly assume that the coupling of the dust to the gas is strong enough to prevent solid grains from being gravitationally deflected onto the planetesimals according to the usual gas - free approximation .",
    "the issue of whether or not the runaway mode is significant for snowball growth would require an investigation using high resolution coupled n - body and hydrodynamic models that exceed the scope of this paper .    in summary",
    ", we believe that the interpretation of the present - day asteroid size distribution as a proof of their large initial sizes @xcite needs further investigation in the light of the results presented here on the importance of dust sweeping for early planetesimal growth . at the very least , snowball growth opens up the possibility that various conditions with different combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath25 could all potentially reproduce the asteroids size - distribution , to the point that the solution may be highly degenerate .",
    "in fact , recent work by @xcite has already shown that planetesimals with birth - size ( @xmath18 ) of 0.1 km are also a viable initial condition for a model which can well reproduce the asteroids size - distribution .",
    "further work would be required , using a detailed numerical collision - and - fragmentational model ( e.g. as implemented in @xcite or @xcite ) , to understand whether the observed size distribution in the asteroid belt can at all constrain the range of @xmath18 and @xmath25 in the early solar system .",
    "i.e. it may be that certain ranges of @xmath18 and @xmath25 corresponding to sub - regions of the red regime of fig.[figtrsnow ] may give rise to size distributions that are better able to reproduce the observed size distribution in the asteroid belt , while other regions can be excluded .",
    "however , even so , we would still be far from arriving at a final answer , as several important questions remain unaddressed , including ( 1 ) what is the distribution of sizes with which planetesimals are initially created ?",
    "( 2 ) how are the planetesimal births distributed in time and space ( linear or nonlinear ) ? ( 3 ) to what degree should runway growth and gravitational focusing be considered in the snowball growth model ? all of these factors can change the dimension of the red regime of fig.[figtrsnow ] , and constraining any of these factors will require further detailed studies of planetesimal formation itself .",
    "last but not least , in addition to studies of the formation of asteroids and planetesimals , we may also obtain constraints on planetesimal birth sizes through other observations , such as those of debris disk around a - type and g - type stars @xcite .",
    "the results shown in fig.[figtrsnow ] also allow us to place constraints on the birth rate of planetesimals or their formation efficiency for each possible formation scenario .",
    "in addition , they might help overcome some difficulties that some of these different formation scenarios encounter .    recently two new models @xcite have shown that large planetesimals can form directly from the concentration of small solid particles in the turbulent disk .",
    "the numerical simulation by @xcite show that if the feedback of the solid particles within the gas is considered then the concentration of solid particles ( which is most efficient for particles of @xmath145 cm radial size ) can grow and be maintained long enough ( the so - called streaming instability , @xcite ) , for the formation of very large planetesimals ( typically 100 - 1000 km ) . within this framework ,",
    "i.e. , with such large initial planetesimals , our results ( fig.[figtrsnow ] ) show that the phase of snowball growth would be inefficient .",
    "in such a scenario , the only way to convert a large amount of dust to planetesimals within 1 - 10myr is through a very effective planetesimal formation process .",
    "nevertheless , one must be careful and note that fig.[figtrsnow ] ignores the runaway growth mode which might be relevant to such large planetesimals .",
    "if a runaway mode is included , then the snowball timescale , @xmath73 , given in fig.[figtrsnow ] should be considered as a upper limit . however , as discussed in  4.1.2 , the degree to which a runaway mode should contribute must rely on future studies with high resolution coupled n - body and hydrodynamic models .",
    "moreover , one should also note that disk turbulence is much more intense in @xcite than that in fig.[figtrsnow ] of this paper . as in @xcite ,",
    "the disk viscosity coefficient is adopted @xmath146 , leading to @xmath85 close to unity according to eqn.108 of @xcite and thus inefficient snowball growth would result .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the size and efficiency with which planetesimals can be formed via the mechanism of @xcite but with weaker turbulence .",
    "the other large - planetesimal model @xcite also relies on turbulence which can generate vortices to trap small particles @xcite of chondrule - size ( typically mm - cm ) .",
    "@xcite showed that mm - sized particle can be sporadically concentrated by disk turbulence , forming large and gravitationally bond clumps , which can potentially shrink to solid planetesimals roughly 10 - 100 km in radius .",
    "however , based on the model of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite investigated the planetesimal formation rate in details and found that it should be very low in the solar system : at 1 au for a typical mmsn disk , the time it would take to convert most dust into planetesimals , @xmath25 , would be over @xmath147 yr .",
    "snowball growth might help in solving this problem by creating a second channel by which dust can be converted into planetesimals .",
    "fig.[figtrsnow ] shows that , for the case of weak turbulence ( this turbulence level in fig.[figtrsnow ] is compatible with the weak turbulence adopted in @xcite ) , the time to convert dust into planetesimals is close to @xmath73 , which is much shorter than @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , @xmath73 can be within the disk life - time ( 1 - 10 myr ) even for @xmath148 yr .",
    "in other words , snowball growth would fully dominate in terms of transforming dust into planetesimals .    beside the two new models described above",
    ", there are the two traditional models of planetesimal formation described in  1 .",
    "one is the mutual sticking scenario @xcite , in which planetesimals form by pair - wise collisions of small particles .",
    "the other is the instability scenario @xcite , which suggests that planetesimals form via gravitational instabilities in a dense particle sub - disk near the midplane of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "both scenarios remain debated .",
    "as mentioned in our introduction , the collisional scenario is challenged by the well - known  meter - barrier `` , while for the instability scenario it has not yet been established whether a disk of solid particles can become dense enough and dynamically cold enough to trigger instability .",
    "while these issues go well beyond the scope of this work , the present results show that , for both scenarios , snowball growth might represent an interesting way to allow planetesimal growth to happen despite these difficulties .",
    "indeed , in both models planetesimals are thought to form with a radius of 0.1 - 10 km . for this size range , fig.[figtrsnow ]",
    "shows that snowball growth could convert most of the dust mass into planetesimals even if formation rates are very low ( large @xmath25 ) .",
    "this means that only a few ' ' lucky seeds \" are needed in order for planetesimal growth to proceed . within the framework of these two scenarios",
    ", these seeds could either be a few lucky pre - planetesimals that have overcome the  meter barrier \" for some reasons @xcite or kilometer - sized objects that were formed in some isolated location where the critical condition for gravitational instability just happens to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "therefore , snowball growth lowers the requirements for those two traditional scenarios : direct planetesimal formation from dust could be very inefficient and still allow planetesimal growth to occur .",
    "this hypothesis remains to be quantified : future work should focus on deriving the planetesimal formation rates within the frame of those two traditional scenarios , to see whether they can meet these `` lowered '' requirements .",
    "the context in which snowball growth might find its most interesting application is that of planet formation in binaries .",
    "recent studies have shown that one of the major problems for planet formation in close binary systems , such as @xmath2 centauri , is the intermediate stage of planet formation , i.e , the mutual accretion of km - sized planetesimals to form larger planetary embryos or cores @xcite .",
    "the companion s gravitational perturbation , coupled to gas drag , may excite large relative velocities between the planetesimals , leading to disruptive collisions which inhibit their mutual accretion @xcite .",
    "recently , some mechanisms have been found to be somewhat helpful in solving this problem @xcite , but several problems remain to be overcome .",
    "a possible solution to these problems would be to let planetesimal collisions only begin when large ( @xmath149 km ) objects are present in the system .",
    "@xcite have indeed shown that the gravity of such large planetesimals is strong enough for them to survive the high - speed collisions induced by differential gas drag .",
    "one obvious way to bypass this problematic kilometer size range would be to have planetesimals that are `` born big '' , be it by the @xcite or the @xcite scenario . however , the issue of how these planetesimal formation scenarios might work in the very specific context of binaries has not yet been addressed .",
    "snowball growth offers an attractive alternative way to bypass the kilometer size range , _ regardless _ of the initial size at which planetesimals appear in the disk , because it predicts that mutual planetesimal impacts will become important only by the time large objects have formed .",
    "however , it is not possible to directly apply the results of the previous sections , derived for single stars , to the close binary case . in this section ,",
    "we address the issue of how snowball growth proceeds in the specific context of double stars .      for the sake of clarity we consider a disk with a 1@xmath151mmsn surface density and set @xmath86 au , and then investigate how snowball growth may occur in binary star systems , taking as a representative example the case of @xmath2 centauri ab , for which the binary separation is @xmath152 au and the eccentricity @xmath153 0.52 @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the single star case and the binary case is that in the binary case there is a much higher relative velocity between the dust and the planetesimals ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "for such a highly eccentric case , we can safely neglect the small component of @xmath40 due to the differential keplerian velocities between the gas and the planetesimals ( because the gas is pressure supported ) and basically consider two cases , depending on the unknown angle @xmath154 between the circumprimary disk plane and the binary s orbital plane :    1 .   _ the coplanar binary case _",
    ", where the binary orbit and the gas disk are in the same plane . in this case , to a first approximation , the average eccentricity of planetesimals ( @xmath155 ) is equal to their forced eccentricity ( @xmath156 ) , and thus @xmath157 , leading to @xmath158 for the @xmath2 cen case .",
    "this @xmath40 value , and thus also the snowball growth rate , is roughly one order of magnitude higher than in the single star case .",
    "we then obtain @xmath159 in a weakly turbulent disk with @xmath160 .",
    "note that we here implicitly assume that the gas disk is axisymmetric ( circular ) in the circumprimary midplane .",
    "this is a rather crude approximation as it ignores the reaction of the gas disk to the binary perturber .",
    "nevertheless , as a first order of approximation , we believe it is both reasonable and convenient for our semi - analytical study in this paper .",
    "in fact , if the reaction of the gas disk is considered , @xmath40 would probably be even larger , as shown by paardekooper et al .",
    "therefore , the @xmath40 , as well as the snowball growth rate @xmath83 derived in our simplified axisymmetric gas disk model should be treated as a _",
    "lower _ limit .",
    "2 .   _ the inclined binary case _ , where the binary orbital plane is tilted by an angle ( @xmath154 ) relative to the gas disk plane . in such a case , as simulated by @xcite , if the mach number of the gas disk is not too high , the gas disk can maintain its structure and undergo a near rigid precession . as a planetesimal also undergoes a similar precession ( regarding the binary orbital plane as the reference plane ) but",
    "with a different rate , the relative angle between the gas disk plane and planetesimal orbital plane will remain approximately within the range @xmath161 . taking the medium value @xmath154 as the average",
    ", we then have @xmath162 .",
    "taking into account this @xmath40 , as well as the fraction of time that a planetesimal spends moving within the dust - disk , @xmath163 , then the snowball growth rate for the inclined case is @xmath164 , which is independent of both @xmath154 and the turbulence factor @xmath85 .",
    "+ note that , for the inclined case , we have implicitly assumed that the vertical excursion of the planetesimals is higher than the dust disk thickness , i.e. , @xmath165 .",
    "however , even for a fully turbulent disk ( @xmath166 ) , this condition is easily met as long as @xmath167 .",
    "in addition , we also implicitly assume for the inclined case that @xmath40 is dominated by @xmath154 rather than @xmath168 , which requires @xmath169 ( i.e. comparing @xmath40 in the the inclined and coplanar cases ) , i.e. , @xmath170 , is low whereas the forced inclination , which is independent of the semi - major axis , stays at a high value ] .",
    "given the above considerations , we shall consider that the inclined case discussed here corresponds to cases with @xmath167 .",
    "otherwise it should be treated as the coplanar case .",
    "the collision timescale , @xmath106 , among planetesimals is also different in the binary case .",
    "the relation given in eqn.[tcol ] , which assumes an unperturbed disk with equipartition between in and out - of - plane velocities , breaks down in binary systems .",
    "here we use the empirical scaling law given by @xcite ( see eqn.6 and eqn.7 in their paper for details ) to estimate the planetesimal collisional timescale in binary star systems as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the collisional timescale for single star systems as given by eqn.[tcol ] . +      with the modified @xmath83 and @xmath150 , we can derive @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 as in the single star case .",
    "results are plotted in fig.[figtrsnow2 ] and fig.[figtrsnow3 ] for the coplanar and inclined binary cases respectively .    1 .   _",
    "coplanar case_. compared to the single star case of fig.[figtrsnow ] , we obtain slightly smaller , but still relatively large values of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath173 .",
    "@xmath76 is little changed , but @xmath73 is about one order of magnitude smaller ( fig.[figtrsnow2 ] ) .",
    "these high @xmath77 and low @xmath73 values imply that snowball growth can be efficient , even if the disk life - time in such close binaries could be an order of magnitude shorter than in single - star systems @xcite .",
    "note that , as for the single star case , results depend on the disk turbulence , which is controlled , to a first approximation , by @xmath85 . here",
    ", we have assumed a value of @xmath97 , corresponding to weak turbulence .",
    "inclined binary case_. @xmath77 are here higher than in the coplanar case , being close to @xmath174 throughout the @xmath115 plane of fig.[figtrsnow3 ] ( in fact , @xmath175 , but we stop the evolution of the system when @xmath77 reaches the alarm value 0.5 as mentioned at the end of section 2.2 ) .",
    "compared to the single star case of fig.[figtrsnow ] , @xmath76 is smaller by @xmath176 , but @xmath73 is larger by about 1 order of magnitude ( more precisely , by a factor of @xmath1777 ) .",
    "this implies that the disk lifetime has to be relatively long in order for snowball growth to be efficient . as an example , if planetesimals are born small ( @xmath178 km ) , then in order for them to reach @xmath179 km , i.e. , values large enough to survive the high - speed collisions induced by the companion , then the disk life - time should be no less than @xmath13 yr . note that , as @xmath83 is independent of @xmath85 ( see $ 4.2.1 ) , the result is here independent of the level of disk turbulence .    the results for both cases considered show that snowball growth might indeed be an attractive alternative to solving the planet - formation - in - binaries dilemma , i.e. , the high impact velocities that prevent the mutual accretion of kilometre - sized bodies .",
    "it s main appeal is that it provides a much safer way for planetesimals to reach sizes in the 50 - 100 km range , after which they are large enough to be protected from destructive collisions .",
    "the only problem lies with the growth timescales , in particular for the inclined binary case for which it might take as long as @xmath180yr to reach the safe 100 km size , by which time the gas disk might have vanished .",
    "however , this issue might not be as dramatic as it might appear because , even if 50 - 100 km bodies have not been formed by the time the gas disk is dispersed , the environment could be favorable to accretion anyway .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that , during this gas dispersion phase , planetesimal orbits get re - phased so that , by the time the gas has dispersed , relative velocities amongst them are very low and accretion friendly .",
    "this means that , even if snowball growth is switched off ( because there is no dust sweeping when grains stop to follow gas streamlines ) , planetesimal growth can now proceed through the classical mutual - accretion channel .",
    "we note that the 2-d investigation performed by @xcite demonstrated that planetesimals can grow to @xmath17750 - 100 km size with the help of dust accretion .",
    "our own investigation extends this to the 3-dimensional case , demonstrating that even though 3-d collision rates are significantly lower , dust accretion ( or snowball growth ) can still help planetesimals to overcome the  km - barrier \" for planetesimal accretion ( or growth ) in close binary systems , such as @xmath2 centauri .",
    "one possibly problematic assumption of our snowball growth model regards the efficiency of dust accretion onto planetesimals , parameterized by @xmath41 defined in eqn.[sweep ] , for which we have implicitly assumed that it is not affected by the high @xmath40 values reached in the binary environment .",
    "although recent laboratory experiments @xcite showed that small ( mm - sized ) particles can be efficiently accreted by large objects in a high - speed collision , their test speeds were only of a few 10 ms@xmath181 , which is only relevant for the snowball growth in a single star system with @xmath182 ms@xmath181 .",
    "in close binary systems , such as the @xmath2 centauri shown above , @xmath40 could be as high as 500 - 5000 ms@xmath181 , which is beyond the limit of the test speed in any existing laboratory experiment .",
    "therefore , the issue of whether dust can be accreted onto small planetesimal seeds ( @xmath183 km ) for such large relative velocity remains unresolved .",
    "however , at the very least , it seems reasonable to assume that the efficiency of dust accretion onto planetesimals will be _ less _ affected by high velocities than would the efficiency of mutual planetesimal accretion .",
    "we have investigated the transitional phase of planet formation , dubbed `` snowball growth phase '' , in which planetesimals are progressively emerging from the dust disk but are not yet numerous enough to enter the phase of mutual planetesimal - planetesimal collision . in this snowball phase ,",
    "the planetesimals move on keplerian orbits and grow purely through the direct accretion of sub - cm sized dust which is entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk and moves with sub - keplerian velocity .    using a simplified model in which the planetesimals are progressively created from the dust disk",
    ", we find that :    1",
    ".   in single - star systems , snowball growth can be a significant mechanism if the following conditions are met : * the dust disk must be thin and dense , i.e. , the gas disk must be weakly turbulent ( see  [ secn : examples ] ) ; * the planetesimal creation timescale , defined by the time to convert half the total dust mass into planetismals by the planetesimal - formation process alone , must be long ( roughly @xmath184 yr - see  [ secn : examples ] ) ; * planetesimals must be born ( relatively ) small : if planetesimals are born larger than 100 km , then ( ignoring the runaway growth mode ) snowball growth will be inefficient or completely absent ( see  [ secn : mapping ] ) .",
    "+ _ if _ these conditions are met , then we find that * size growth can be significant : 2 orders of magnitude in radius ( 6 orders in mass ) , before mutual planetesimal collisions take over .",
    "in addition , snowball growth can be fast enough for it to happen within the typical ( 1 - 10myr ) lifetime of a protoplanetary gas disk ( see  [ secn : mapping ] ) .",
    "* snowball growth can be the dominant mode for the transformation of dust into planetesimals . except for highly efficient and fast planet - formation scenarios",
    ", dust is preferentially accreted onto already formed kilometre - sized bodies rather than consumed for forming new  initial \" planetesimals ( see  4.1.1 ) . *",
    "applying the snowball growth model to a fiducial mmsn disk for the solar system and assuming weak turbulence , then the turnover from snowball to mutual collisions is likely to occur when planetesimals reach a size of 100 - 1000 km , _ irrespective _ of their birth size ( e.g. 0.1 - 100 km ) .",
    "this result , i.e. , that mutual impacts become significant only when large bodies have formed , may provide an alternative explanation to the size distribution of asteroids ( @xcite , see  4.1.2 ) .",
    "* snowball growth could help overcome some still unsolved problems inherent to some planet formation scenarios .",
    "more precisely , it lowers the requirements on the planetesimal formation mechanism itself , by allowing planetesimals to grow , and dust to be transferred onto them , even if the mechanism by which they are formed is very inefficient ( see  4.1.3 ) .",
    "2 .   for close binaries",
    ", snowball growth offers a way to overcome one major problem for planet formation in binaries , i.e. , the high impact velocities that prevent kilometer - sized planetesimals from accreting each other .",
    "indeed , this dynamically excited environment , which is hostile to mutual planetesimal accretion , is on the contrary favorable to growth by dust sweeping .",
    "if efficient enough , snowball growth allows planetesimals to grow large enough , 50 - 100 km , to be protected from mutually destructive impacts .",
    "two main cases can be distinguished : * in the coplanar binary case ( @xmath185 ) , snowball growth is at its most efficient ( a little more efficient than the single star case , if one assumes the same level of disk turbulence ) but remains sensitive to disk turbulence , i.e. weak turbulence is still required for efficient snowball growth ( see fig.[figtrsnow2 ] and  4.2.2 ) . * in the case of an inclined binary ( @xmath167 ) , snowball growth can still be efficient , although slightly less efficient than in the case of a single star with weak disk turbulence(@xmath97 ) , with the added advantage that it is independent of disk turbulence ( see fig.[figtrsnow3 ] and  4.2.2 ) .    let us stress again that our model is highly simplified and that the present work , whose main objective was to identify a new and potentially significant mechanism , should be considered as a first step towards more detailed studies . in future work , the modeling of snowball growth will need to be improved in a number of aspects .",
    "the most important improvement will be to have a self consistent model of the planetesimal size evolution under the coupled effect of snowball growth and mutual accretion , instead of the simple analytical growth law assumed here .",
    "this requires the development of a global statistical particle - in - a - box model , in the spirit of those of @xcite or @xcite , spanning a wide range in sizes and incorporating all possible outcomes for dust - planetesimal and planetesimal - planetesimal collisions .",
    "other improvements which could be made to the model include , ( i ) the role of gravitational focusing of dust onto planetesimals , in particular to what extent it is ( or is not ) hampered by the action of gas , and ( ii ) the changes to @xmath41 arising from the physics of high velocity impacts of dust onto large bodies , especially in the specific case of close binaries where @xmath40 may reach values of a few 100m.s@xmath181 .",

    "<S> the standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which planetesimals form from a dust disk , followed by a phase of mutual planetesimal - planetesimal collisions , leading eventually to the formation of planetary embryos . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a potential transition phase ( which we call the  snowball phase \" ) , between the formation of the first planetesimals and the onset of mutual collisions amongst them , which has often been either ignored or underestimated in previous studies . in this snowball phase , </S>",
    "<S> isolated planetesimals move on keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion of sub - cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk . using a simplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the dust , we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before mutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number of critical parameters , including the degree of disk turbulence , the planetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation . for systems in </S>",
    "<S> which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and with relatively small birth size , we show that the snowball growth phase can be very important , allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of @xmath0 in mass before mutual collisions take over . in such cases , the snowball growth phase can be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary gas disk . </S>",
    "<S> a noteworthy result is that , for a wide range of physically reasonable parameters , mutual collisions between planetesimals become significant when they reach sizes @xmath1 km , irrespective of their birth size . </S>",
    "<S> this could provide an alternative explanation for the turnover point in the size distribution of the present day asteroid belt . </S>",
    "<S> for the specific case of close binaries such as @xmath2 centauri , the role of snowball growth could be even more important . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it provides a safe way for bodies to grow through the problematic @xmath31 to 50 km size range for which the perturbed environment of the binary can prevent mutual accretion of planetesimals . from a more general perspective </S>",
    "<S> , these preliminary results suggest that an efficient snowball growth phase provides a large amount of  room at the bottom \" for theories of planet formation . </S>"
