    "graphene , a recently discovered two - dimensional form of carbon , has attracted unrivaled attention due to its unique physical properties and potential applications in electronics.@xcite this nanomaterial is particularly promising for the field of spintronics , which exploits both the spin and the charge of electrons.@xcite one fundamental spintronic effect is the magnetoresistance , the change in electric resistance as a function of the relative orientation , either parallel or antiparallel , of the magnetization of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic spacer layer.@xcite achieving _ high _ magnetoresistance ratios while keeping reasonably _ low _ electric resistance is crucial for many technological applications.@xcite however , reaching this goal is currently hindered by material - specific restrictions such as the inability of producing well - ordered ferromagnet / spacer interfaces.@xcite    semimetallic graphene and its insulating counterpart , isostructural hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath0-bn ) , are promising spacers as epitaxial monolayers of these materials can be grown by means of chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on a broad variety of metallic substrates.@xcite the quality of such epitaxial monolayers is very high and the covalent bonding network of both graphene and @xmath0-bn is perfectly preserved upon the bonding to the substrate . moreover ,",
    "the growth of graphene and @xmath0-bn on fcc(111 ) and hcp(0001 ) surfaces of ferromagnetic co and ni results in commensurate epitaxial layers due to the closely matching lattice constants.@xcite this has led to a theoretical prediction of perfect spin filtering and , thus , to extremely high magnetoresistance ratios in such junctions based on multilayer graphene ( @xmath14 layers ) and graphite.@xcite however , the cvd growth on crystalline surfaces is self - inhibiting , that is only one epitaxial layer can be grown .",
    "the deposition of ferromagnetic nanoparticles on top of epitaxial @xmath0-bn has also been demonstrated.@xcite these interfaces further offer the opportunity of fine tuning their properties through the intercalation of other metals , such as fe,@xcite cu@xcite and au.@xcite    in this work , we suggest the use of monolayer graphene and @xmath0-bn as _ covalently _ bonded spacer layers of minimal thickness in magnetoresistive junctions . through first principles calculations we study the structural , magnetic and spin transport properties of such junctions based on first - row ferromagnetic transition metals :",

    "we find that both graphene ( gr ) and @xmath0-bn bound to the transition metals ( tm ) display short metal - carbon and metal - nitrogen distances ( 2.192.45   ) comparable to the sum of the corresponding covalent bond radii . the thickness of the spacer layer is thus comparable to that of a single atomic plane of the ferromagnetic metal . for the ni@xmath10gr@xmath10ni(fcc )",

    "[ fig3](a ) ] , which are relevant to the quantum conductances of bulk metals.@xcite the total transmission probabilities of the junctions in the parallel configurations constitute @xmath1940% and @xmath1920% of the sharvin conductances@xcite of bulk hcp co along the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "the quantum conductances in the antiparallel configuration are mostly determined by the overlap of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "their values are consequently lower ( @xmath20  @xmath15 per unit cell for both spacer materials ) .",
    "the resulting magnetoresistance ratios are 86% and 66% for graphene and @xmath0-bn junctions .",
    "thus , in the regime of ultimate thickness the transport properties are largely independent of the electronic structure differences of the two spacer materials .",
    "the role of a single layer of covalent spacer material consists in fixing a certain stacking order at the interface and in providing a medium for the abrupt change of magnetization in the antiparallel configuration . due to the metallic nature of the spacer layers [ cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] such junctions possess low resistance area products ( @xmath213@xmath810@xmath22  @xmath23m@xmath24 ) which makes them suitable for nanoscale spintronics applications such as the magnetic random access memories and spin transfer nano - oscillators .",
    "we classify the present systems as _ giant magnetoresistance _ ( gmr ) junctions .",
    "this contrasts to the spin transport through a vacuum gap of the same thickness which shows @xmath7 decaying with @xmath25 [ fig .",

    "for all three metals , the majority spin transmission in the parallel configuration , @xmath16 , undergoes little change along the fe - co - ni series [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] .",
    "this behavior stems from the similarity of the corresponding majority spin fermi surfaces of the bulk metals , which are formed by partially filled @xmath26 bands .",
    "however , much larger differences are found for @xmath17 involving the minority electrons .",
    "these reflect the drastically different fermi surfaces resulting from the interplay between @xmath26 and @xmath18 states .",
    "the increase of @xmath27 along the series can be attributed to the decrease of hybridization between @xmath26 and @xmath18 electrons upon the increase of @xmath18 band filling:@xcite in general , the free - electron - like @xmath26 states show higher transmission probabilities .",

    "further search of magnetoresistive junctions with improved characteristics may consist in exploring asymmetric junctions and the intercalation of some other chemical elements at the interfaces .",
    "we here demonstrate the second possibility .",
    "it has been suggested that the incorporation of submonolayer quantities of cu at the tm@xmath10gr@xmath29 interface would reduce undesired hybridization between the states of graphene and of the metal surface at the price of substantially decreasing the magnetoresistance ratios.@xcite however , we find that the decoupling of the spacer layer from the metal surface does not necessarily imply the loss of magnetoresistance",
    ". this can be achieved by intercalating the metals from the middle of the transition metals series , e.g.  mn , which show reduced binding to carbon @xmath30 systems.@xcite indeed , in the intercalated comn(1  ml)@xmath10gr@xmath10mn(1  ml)co(hcp ) junction the mn ",
