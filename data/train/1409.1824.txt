    "<S> background : :    precision measurements at low energy search for physics beyond the    standard model in a way complementary to searches for new particles at    colliders . in the weak sector </S>",
    "<S> the most general @xmath0    decay hamiltonian contains , besides vector and axial - vector terms ,    also scalar , tensor and pseudoscalar terms . </S>",
    "<S> current limits on the    scalar and tensor coupling constants from neutron and nuclear    @xmath0 decay are on the level of several percent . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    extracting new information on tensor coupling constants by measuring    the @xmath0-asymmetry parameter in the pure gamow - teller    decay of @xmath1cu , thereby testing the v - a structure of    the weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    an iron sample foil into which the radioactive nuclei were implanted    was cooled down to millikelvin temperatures in a    @xmath2he-@xmath3he dilution refrigerator . </S>",
    "<S> an    external magnetic field of 0.1 t , in combination with the internal    hyperfine magnetic field , oriented the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic    @xmath0 radiation was observed with planar high purity    germanium detectors operating at a temperature of about 10k . </S>",
    "<S> an    on - line measurement of the @xmath0 asymmetry of    @xmath4cu was performed as well for normalization    purposes . </S>",
    "<S> systematic effects were investigated using geant4    simulations . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the experimental value , @xmath5  =  0.587(14 ) , is in    agreement with the standard model value of 0.5991(2 ) and is    interpreted in terms of physics beyond the standard model . the limits    obtained on possible tensor type charged currents in the weak    interaction hamiltonian are -0.045 @xmath6    0.159 ( 90% c.l . ) . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    the obtained limits are comparable to limits from other correlation    measurements in nuclear @xmath0  decay and contribute to    further constraining tensor coupling constants . </S>"
