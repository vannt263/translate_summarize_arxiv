    "there exists a number of important cases of real world networks which can be modeled by a regular lattice with additional long - range connections between nodes ( shortcuts ) .",
    "while the local connectivity structure for such a networks remains similar to the original underlying lattice , the shortest path between any two distant lattice nodes becomes much smaller so that the resulting network possesses the small - world property with at most logarithmic increase of the mean distance between nodes with growth of the system size ( see , e.g. @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "examples of such networks includes linear polymer networks , transportation networks , _ in vitro _",
    "neuronal networks ( neuronal cultures ) , lattice models for space - time with wormholes , mobile and wireless networks and interconnection networks for supercomputers . for definiteness ,",
    "in this work we have in mind as a principal use case designing an optimal interconnection networks for future generation supercomputers though the results obtained can be applied to other real networks of the type considered .",
    "after the petaflop ( @xmath0  flops ) performance barrier for supercomputers was broken , the high - performance computing community is exploring development of the principles for creation of next generation systems with performance of the order of exaflop ( @xmath1  flops ) @xcite .",
    "though first exaflop systems are estimated to be built between 2018 and 2020 , approaches and basic principles of their construction are currently being actively investigated because on a way to their creation it is necessary to overcome a number of complex scientific and technical challenges and to elaborate essentially new approaches to development of their architecture and the hardware implementation .",
    "one of the most important components of any supercomputer is the interconnection network which primarily defines ability to increase the number of computing nodes that is necessary for achieving the desirable performance . according to very modest estimations ( see , for example , @xcite )",
    ", interconnection networks of exaflop supercomputers must have more than 100 000 endpoints / cpus ( each most likely with many cores ) .",
    "thus , one of key problems which should be solved on a way to next generation supercomputers is the development of interconnection network architecture with good scalability and ability to provide communication between huge number of computing nodes .",
    "three basic aspects of any interconnection network which mostly define its functionality are :    * network topology , * flow control , and * routing algorithm .    in this work",
    "we discuss mainly network topology .",
    "two other aspects are quite important but out of the scope of this paper .",
    "a correct choice of network topology is vital for network design because both flow control and routing algorithms are heavily based on the topological properties of the network under consideration .",
    "moreover , we shall consider only so called direct interconnection networks in which every node serves both as a processor unit and as a router .",
    "indirect networks have their own merits for relatively small networks but are not well scalable . among direct networks the interconnection networks with lattice structure and @xmath2-dimensional torus topology are widely used . in supercomputing literature",
    "such networks are termed `` @xmath3-ary @xmath4-cube '' @xcite ( @xmath4 is the torus dimension , in our notations @xmath5 ; @xmath3 is the number of nodes along each dimension ) .",
    "these networks possess a number of advantages , in particular :    * high resilience of the networks as a whole in case of failure of some nodes ( existence of bypass communication paths ) , * hypercube of dimensionality which is enough for a given number of nodes provides small average distance between nodes , * in case of simulation of @xmath2-dimensional objects , the structure of the computing tasks is mapped to the @xmath2-dimensional lattice of computing nodes in an optimal way ; it is worth mentioning that just tasks of this kind ( especially for @xmath6 ) are supposed to constitute a considerable part of tasks for the next generation supercomputers .",
    "however in the case of huge number of nodes typical for next generation supercomputers , the @xmath2-dimensional lattice toruses have also essential shortcomings .",
    "in particular , lattices of low dimensionality have very large average path length between nodes while lattices of high dimensionality , comparable with logarithm of number of nodes , are inconvenient for embedding into real physical space and therefore for implementation because of huge length of communication links .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that interconnection networks with minimal average distance for a given number of nodes have the best operation characteristics , such as , e.g. , performance and robustness ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "thus usual networks with simple structure of the regular lattices will be ineffective for solution of tasks of general type except those related to triangulation of @xmath2-dimensional objects .    for that matter",
    "it seems attractive to use for the next generation supercomputers interconnection networks with small - world property .",
    "the point is that while for the regular @xmath2-dimensional lattice the average distance @xmath7 between nodes grows as the power of number of nodes : @xmath8 , in the case of a network with the small - world properties @xmath7 grows essentially slower : @xmath9 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some complex networks have average distance that depends on the number of nodes in the power - like manner similarly to the regular lattices but with the exponent which is significantly smaller : @xmath10 . quite often",
    "investigation of network properties are carried out by means of numerical simulations and it is not easy to distinguish such power - like behavior from logarithmic one . from the applications point of view and in the case of small enough exponent",
    "the difference is unessential too",
    ". therefore we will consider that such networks also possess the small - world property .    in the classical version",
    "@xcite complex networks with small - world properties appears at the intermediate stage in the process of stochastic transformation of a regular lattice into erds - rnyi random graphs @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , the structure of the regular lattice is being broken . as it was mentioned above",
    ", this is undesirable for the interconnection networks .",
    "therefore in this work we shall use the modification of the small - world networks construction in which the original lattice is preserved and is supplemented by additional links ( shortcuts ) providing the small - world properties ( see @xcite , sect . iv.c.2 and refs . therein ) .",
    "a simplified form of such networks in one- and two - dimensional cases is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : rsp_1d_2d ] .",
    "below for brevity we shall use for such networks the term `` lattice networks with shortcuts '' ( lns ) .",
    "it is necessary to note that besides the small average distance between nodes one more distinctive property of the small - world networks is high degree of clusterization @xcite , @xcite .",
    "high clusterization provides local fault tolerance of the networks because of existence of local bypass paths in the case of a node failure .",
    "note , however , that in the case of lns with @xmath11 such a local fault tolerance ( existence of local bypass paths ) is provided by the underlying lattice .",
    "path length ( distance ) between nodes is understood in the network sense : as the minimum number of edges which it is necessary to pass to get from one node to another .",
    "respectively the average distance between nodes is defined as an average over all pairs of nodes for a given network .",
    "however for huge interconnection networks such an average distance may prove to be inadequate characteristic .",
    "the point is that for finding the shortest routes it is necessary to know global structure of the network ( positions of all the shortcuts ) .",
    "therefore the routing of messages using the shortest paths can be too cumbersome and ineffective because it requires storing and processing large data amounts . thus routing algorithms based on local navigation @xcite , @xcite become of special importance .    in case of local navigation",
    "the node `` knows '' only a geographical position ( position in the underlying lattice ) of all nodes and the nearest neighbors with the account of shortcuts . using only this information ( information about all",
    "the shortcuts is not used ) it is necessary to deliver a message to the destination node along shortest possible path .",
    "the simplest solution of this problem is to use the greedy algorithm : the current node sends the message to that of its neighbors which geographically ( in the sense of coordinates on the underlying lattice ) is closest to the destination node .",
    "later we will consider a more complicated modification for the local navigation algorithm .    in this work we investigate the average global and local navigation paths between nodes as the most important specifications defining communication properties of networks .",
    "the main goal is to develop an optimal algorithm for construction of a network with large number of nodes but small average global and/or local navigation path lengths between nodes .",
    "a general idea is to add to a regular lattice shortcuts according to an algorithm ( or algorithms ) in such a way that `` cost - quality '' ratio be optimized for the network obtained . under the character of `` cost '' we choose unit wiring cost , i.e. , total length of all shortcuts divided by the number of nodes in the network ( total shortcuts length per node ) , while `` quality '' is the global or navigation path length between nodes .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the original algorithm @xcite for small - world network construction is stochastic one : at each step of the algorithm the graph edges randomly change their positions with a given probability . as result of such an algorithm",
    "there appears an ensemble of graphs with some distribution of their characteristic properties , in particular , with some distribution of average global and local navigation path lengths between nodes . for many real networks",
    "the stochasticity is an inherent property ( e.g. , this is true for web and internet ; other examples see , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "however in the case of interconnection networks ( as well as for other transportation networks , e.g. for airline networks ) the design / construction process is under full control of a developer .",
    "therefore the stochasticity is not inherent for this process .",
    "thus an important question is the following : is there such a deterministic algorithm for lattice modification turning it into a small - world network that the cost - quality ratio be better than in the case of stochastic algorithms . actually obtaining an answer to this question is one of the principal goals of this work .",
    "though some results are valid for lattices of any dimension , in this work we consider the simplest case of one - dimensional lattices with torus topology ( see fig .  [ fig : rsp_1d_2d](a ) ) .",
    "the main reason for this is a convenience of optimization of various algorithms and of comparison of networks properties because of shorter simulation time .",
    "generalization to high - dimensional lattices will be considered in subsequent papers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ mmr ] a short review of both known in the literature and original algorithms of lns construction",
    "is presented . in section [ sdmu ] general properties of global average distance of the obtained lsp",
    "are considered while section [ lnrp ] is devoted to consideration of average navigation path length . in section [ oaks ]",
    "we present a method for selection of best lattice network with shortcuts ( lns ) on the basis of cost - quality ratio optimization .",
    "the section [ zak ] contains a conclusion .",
