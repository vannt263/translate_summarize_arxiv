    "let @xmath1 denote the number of partitions of the integer @xmath2 into at most @xmath0 parts .",
    "the generating function of @xmath3 @xmath4 may be decomposed into partial fractions : @xmath5 we shall refer to the @xmath6 defined by   as the _ rademacher coefficients_.    near the end of his posthumously published masterpiece _ topics in analytic number theory _",
    "@xcite , hans rademacher made the following conjecture :    for all integers @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 exists and equals @xmath12 evaluated at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the dedekind sum , @xmath15 is the forward difference operator , so that @xmath16 and @xmath17    if the rademacher conjecture would have been true then it would have followed that @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    the floating - point approximation for the value of @xmath21 stated by rademacher  @xcite was erroneous , as were the exact values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( for the latter he gave exactly one half of the correct value ) .",
    "these erroneous values were quoted , without correction , by andrews  @xcite .",
    "rademacher supplied ( with one error ) a table of values for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and in fact these values are not too far off from his conjectured `` @xmath28 '' cases .",
    "rademacher began work on the book in which this conjecture appeared  @xcite no later than 1944 and was still working on it at the inception of his final illness .",
    "thus as the final version was edited and published by rademacher s students emil grosswald , joseph lehner , and morris newman , after rademacher s death in 1969 , we will never know whether rademacher came to doubt the truth of the conjecture after he had written it down .",
    "however , george andrews reports that rademacher discussed the conjecture in a course he taught at the university of pennsylvania during the 19611962 academic year .    in  @xcite , augustine munagi considered a different type of partial fraction decomposition called @xmath29-partial fractions , and proved a special case of the analog of the rademacher conjecture , relative to the @xmath29-partial fraction decomposition .    we should also note that the first to cast doubts on the rademacher conjecture were jane friedman and leon ehrenpreis .",
    "ehrenpreis  @xcite stated , `` if one attempts to carry out the usual type of partial fraction decomposition of the partition function term - by - term , it is difficult to compute the coefficients .",
    "my student , jane friedman , spent a great deal of time trying to apply computer algorithm methods to compare the coefficients with those of rademacher  unfortunately , the computer study proved inconclusive . ''    in this article , we present overwhelming evidence against this conjecture , taken literally , but we will present ample evidence for a modified conjecture . additionally , we will present a fast algorithm for generating the rademacher coefficients , and formulas for a selection of particular rademacher coefficients .",

    "note that @xmath40 differs from @xmath21 , rademacher s conjectured value of @xmath41 , by less than @xmath42 , but then things go down hill ( for the conjecture ) from there , and get particularly bad after about @xmath43 .",
    "numerical evidence points to the sequence @xmath24 oscillating and attaining arbitrarily large positive and negative values .",
    "the same thing is true for other sequences @xmath6 ; see the output file at + ` http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/ohans11 ` .",
    "+ by examining the graphs in figures  [ c011 - 100 ] and  [ c011 - 200 ] and the associated numerical data , it seems reasonable to state the following alternative conjecture :    @xmath24 is an oscillating function of @xmath0 of  period \" @xmath44 , with local maxima ( resp .",
    "local minima ) that attain arbitrarily large positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) values as @xmath0 increases .    by  period @xmath44 \"",
    "we mean that the peaks and valleys , eventually , recur at a period of @xmath44 .",
    "we also noticed , numerically , that the elevations and depths of successive peaks and valleys roughly grows exponentially with a factor around @xmath45 .",
    "specifically , @xmath24 has local maxima at @xmath46 + @xmath47 .",
    "the ratio of consecutive local maxima is @xmath48 @xmath24 has a local minimum half way between each local maximum , at @xmath49 .",
    "more precise conjectured asymptotics for @xmath30 for @xmath50 between @xmath36 and @xmath51 can be gotten from    ` http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/ohans10 ` .",
    "+ it appears that all @xmath30 have a `` period '' of @xmath44 .",
    "the locations of the local maxima and minima of @xmath30 , from @xmath52 until @xmath53 occur when @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively . for @xmath56 , they become @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "this gives ( very meager ) evidence of a `` shifting of the perihelion '' , but one would need to go much further to investigate this . more generally , for @xmath30 , and for @xmath59 these locations are congruent to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "probably these too would eventually get shifted ( ever so slowly ) .      if you use the _ definition _ of @xmath24 , or andrews s formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , theorem 1 ) , you ca nt go very far , even with maple .",
    "rademacher calculated @xmath24 for @xmath27 , presumably by hand , and made an error in the @xmath62 case .",
    "andrews  @xcite , who had access to a computer algebra system in 2003 , corrected rademacher s error at @xmath62 and extended the list to @xmath63 .",
    "we need to be more clever .",
    "a fast recurrence for @xmath30 can be derived as follows . since @xmath64",
    "we can multiply both sides by @xmath65 and get @xmath66 once we know @xmath67 , we can find @xmath30 , since they equal @xmath68 .",
    "it remains to find a fast recurrence for @xmath67 .",
    "+ by definition , we have : @xmath69 letting @xmath70 , this is : @xmath71 by the binomial theorem , @xmath72 equating coefficients of @xmath73 we get : @xmath74 and finally : @xmath75 this is implemented in procedure c01(l , n ) of hans .",
    "the same argument leads to efficient recurrences for @xmath6 , except that now we have to distinguish between the case when @xmath0 is divisible by @xmath76 and when it is not , yielding two different recurrences .",
