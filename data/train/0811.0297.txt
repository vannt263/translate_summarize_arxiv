    "in a recent publication @xcite , barthelemy , bertolotti , and wiersma have reported on the fabrication of an unusual random optical medium which they have called a _ lvy glass . _",
    "it consists of a random packing of glass microspheres having a lvy distribution of diameters .",
    "the space between the spheres is filled with strongly scattering nanoparticles .",
    "a photon trajectory therefore consists of ballistic segments of length @xmath0 through spherical regions , connected by isotropic scattering events .",
    "a lvy distribution is characterized by a slowly decaying tail , @xmath9 for @xmath2 , with @xmath10 , such that the second moment ( and for @xmath11 also the first moment ) diverges .",
    "the transmission of light through the lvy glass was analyzed @xcite in terms of a lvy walk @xcite for photons .    because the randomness in the lvy glass is frozen in time ( `` quenched '' disorder ) , correlations exist between subsequent scattering events .",
    "backscattering after a large step is likely to result in another large step .",
    "this is different from a lvy walk , where subsequent steps are independently drawn from the lvy distribution ( `` annealed '' disorder ) .",
    "numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite theories indicate that the difference between quenched and annealed disorder can be captured ( at least approximately ) by a renormalization of the lvy walk exponent  from the annealed value @xmath12 to the quenched value @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the correlations in a lvy glass slow down the diffusion relative to what is expected for a lvy walk , and the effect is the stronger the lower the dimension .    to analyze the effect of such correlations in a quantitative manner",
    ", we consider in this paper the one - dimensional analogue of a lvy glass , which is a linear chain of barriers with independently lvy distributed spacings @xmath0 .",
    "such a system might be produced artificially , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , or it might arise naturally in a porous medium @xcite or in a nanowire @xcite .",
    "earlier studies of this system @xcite have compared the dynamical properties with those of a lvy walk . in particular , barkai , fleurov , and",
    "klafter @xcite found a superdiffusive mean - square displacement as a function of time [ @xmath15 with @xmath16  reminiscent of a lvy walk ( where @xmath17 ) .",
    "no precise correspondence to a lvy walk is to be expected in one dimension , because subsequent step lengths are highly correlated : backscattering after a step of length @xmath0 to the right results in the same step length @xmath0 to the left .",
    "the simplicity of one - dimensional dynamics allows for an exact solution of the static transmission statistics , without having to assume a lvy walk .",
    "we present such a calculation here , and find significant differences with the @xmath18 scaling of the average transmission expected @xcite for a lvy walk ( annealed disorder ) through a system of length @xmath4 .",
    "if the length of the system is measured from the first barrier , we find for the case of quenched disorder an average transmission @xmath19 for @xmath3 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "note that the nonalgebraic length dependence for @xmath3 goes beyond what can be captured by a renormalization of @xmath12 .    in the electronic context",
    "the average conductance @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 , in view of the landauer formula . in that context",
    "it is also of interest to study the shot noise power @xmath24 , which quantifies the time dependent fluctuations of the current due to the granularity of the electron charge .",
    "we calculate the fano factor @xmath25 , and find that @xmath26 approaches the value @xmath7 characteristic of normal diffusion @xcite with increasing @xmath4  but with relatively large corrections that decay only as @xmath8 for @xmath3 .",

    "for @xmath3 the mean spacing is infinite .",
    "we take for each barrier the same mode - independent transmission probability @xmath30 ( no ballistic transmission ) .",
    "the corresponding tunnel resistance is @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the number of transverse modes . in the electronic context",
    "we require @xmath33 , so that the coulomb blockade of single - electron tunneling can be ignored .",
    "we work in the regime of incoherent sequential tunneling ( no resonant tunneling ) .",
    "this regime can be reached for @xmath34 as a result of intermode scattering , or it can be reached even for small @xmath32 as a result of a short phase coherence length . for sequential tunneling the resistance",
    "@xmath35 of @xmath36 barriers in series is just the series resistance @xmath37 [ corresponding to a transmission probability @xmath38 .",
    "we measure this resistance @xmath39 between one contact at @xmath40 and a second contact at @xmath41 .",
    "the numbers @xmath42 indicate the coordinates of the tunnel barriers and @xmath43 is the step function [ @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 .    without further restrictions",
    "the statistics of the conductance would be dominated by ballistic realizations , that have not a single tunnel barrier in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "the reason , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the average distance between a randomly chosen point along the chain and the nearest tunnel barrier diverges for any @xmath10 ( so even if the mean spacing between the barriers is finite ) . to eliminate ballistic transmission",

    "we surmise that step length correlations will play a role in two and three dimensional sparse arrays as well , complicating a direct application of the theory of lvy walks to the experiment .",
    "this is one line of investigation for the future .",
    "a second line of investigation is the effect of wave interference on the transmission of electrons or photons through a sparse chain of tunnel barriers .",

    "the opposite , phase coherent regime was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a single - mode and phase coherent chain interference",
    "can lead to localization , producing an exponential decay of transmission .",
    "an investigation of localization in this system is of particular interest because the sparse chain belongs to the class of disordered systems with long - range disorder , to which the usual scaling theory of anderson localization does not apply @xcite .",

    "anomalous diffusion @xcite is characterized by a mean square displacement @xmath105 with @xmath106 ( subdiffusion ) or @xmath107 ( superdiffusion ) .",

    "@xcite concluded that subdiffusion on a fractal also produces @xmath109 .",
    "here we found a convergence , albeit a logarithmically slow convergence , to the same @xmath7 fano factor for a particular system with superdiffusive dynamics .",
