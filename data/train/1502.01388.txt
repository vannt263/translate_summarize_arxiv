    "the milky way project ( mwp ; @xcite ) is one of a suite of highly productive online citizen science initiatives in the zooniverse , developed and maintained by the citizen science alliance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first implementation of the mwp utilized archived _ spitzer _ glimpse / mipsgal images @xcite to study star formation over one third of the galactic plane via the categorization of infrared `` bubbles '' , which are characteristic of regions and their associated photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "the pdrs are prominent in the irac 8  @xmath0 m band , which traces emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , while mips images of bubble interiors often show 24  @xmath0 m emission , which is likely associated with thermal emission from dust grains within regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the principal task of citizen science volunteers entailed using an ellipse - drawing tool to mark the sizes , orientations , ellipticities , and thicknesses of region / pdr features .",
    "the first data release expanded the previous bubble catalogs of @xcite by nearly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "furthermore mwp citizen science classifications have been used as training sets for a machine learning algorithm @xcite .    demonstrating the serendipitous nature of citizen science efforts , volunteers went beyond their assigned tasks and started tagging and discussing , using the mwp ` talk ' interface , compact yellow objects ( `` yellowballs '' ) in the glimpse / mipsgal images shortly after the mwp opened to the public .",
    "the term is descriptive of their color and compact appearance in the glimpse / mipsgal images , which use a 4.5  @xmath0 m ( blue ) , 8  @xmath0 m ( green ) , and 24  @xmath0 m ( red ) representative color scheme . in total 928 yellowballs",
    "were identified by mwp participants ( see table  [ tbl : ybo ] ) .",
    "most yellowballs appear in three types of environments : ( 1 ) as isolated objects in filamentary infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , along with bright 24  @xmath0 m point sources that are typically associated with embedded massive protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) clustered at the intersection of bipolar bubbles , which have been associated with outflows from massive protoclusters , and are often perpendicular to filamentary irdcs ; and ( 3 ) in bubble hierarchies , often along the rims of large bubbles , many of which have been associated with known regions .    in sections  [ sec :",
    "ybo ] and [ sec : photo ] we use the spatial distribution of yellowballs , cross - matches with existing catalogs of star - formation tracers , and mid- and far - infrared photometry to show that the yellowballs identified in the mwp are a collection of objects tracing a compact , dense phase of massive ( o- and b - type ) star formation .",
    "this includes a mix of compact and ultra - compact regions as well as analogous regions for less massive b stars .",
    "we then examine in section  [ sec : discuss ] the origin of the striking mid - infrared appearance of yellowballs and discuss how they fit into our current picture of massive star formation .",
    "finally , a summary of our findings and our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : lb ] shows the galactic longitude and latitude distribution of yellowballs , along with the distribution of mwp bubbles , and young red _ msx _ source ( rms ) objects , which have been shown to be tracers of galactic star formation activity @xcite .",
    "each histogram was normalized to its largest bin value and offsets were applied in order to facilitate comparison .",
    "it is readily apparent that the yellowball distributions have many similarities with the mwp bubble and rms object distributions . in particular , the mean of the distribution in galactic latitude is slightly below the galactic mid - plane ( @xmath1 ) , and it also peaks slightly above the galactic mid - plane ( in the @xmath2  @xmath3 bin ) . in",
    "longitude we see common features associated with galactic structure , such as peaks around @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xmath7 , as well as a steady decrease in the number of sources beyond @xmath8 . in short ,",
    "the galactic longitude and latitude distribution of yellowballs supports them being a population of sources associated with galactic star formation .",
    "we used the virtual astronomical observatory ( vao ) application topcat @xcite to cross - match the list of yellowball positions with the atlasgal catalog of compact 870  @xmath0 m sources ( average radius @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the catalog of 1.1  mm sources ( average radius @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) from the second data release of the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using a match distance comparable to the average size ( diameter ) of yellowballs ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) we find that 245 ( 49% ) of the 502 yellowballs found within the bgps survey region have a bgps association .",
    "the atlasgal survey encompasses the entire mwp region , and , using the same match distance , we find 524 ( 56% ) of the 928 yellowballs have matches with an atlasgal compact source .",
    "the catalog identifications for associated bgps and atlasgal sources are listed in columns  2 and 3 of table  [ tbl : ybocat ] .    for comparison ,",
    "cross - matches done between 20 randomly generated datasets ( with statistically the same latitude and longitude distribution as the yellowball sample ) had only @xmath15 ( @xmath16% ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18% ) bgps and atlasgal associations on average respectively .",
    "we conclude that any contamination from random associations is minimal , and the proximity of yellowballs to regions of dense molecular gas is again consistent with what would be expected for a population of objects associated with star formation activity .",
    "we performed a similar analysis to cross - match the yellowball positions with the _ wise _ catalog of galactic regions @xcite .",
    "we found that 599 ( 65% ) yellowballs have matches to within @xmath13 ( see column  5 of table  [ tbl : ybocat ] ) .",
    "entries in the _ wise _ region catalog were selected by employing mid - infrared criteria similar to those used to identify `` bubbles '' in the mwp and @xcite catalogs hence it is likely not complete for very compact sources .",
    "their resulting catalog differentiates between four classes of objects ( k , g , c , q ) : known regions , which have measured radio recombination line ( rrl ) or h@xmath19 spectroscopic emission ( k ) ; grouped regions , where candidates are associated via positional correlation with known multiple regions ( g ) ; candidate regions , which have characteristic region mid - infrared morphology spatially coincident with detected radio continuum emission but lack rrl or h@xmath19 observations ( c ; follow - up observations by anderson and colleagues suggest that essentially all objects in group c are bona fide regions ) ; and radio quiet objects , which may contain only intermediate - mass stars , or be regions in either early or late stages of evolution ( q ) .",
    "however , since most of the radio quiet objects have small angular sizes and correlate with cold dust , they are probably in the earliest phases of region evolution @xcite .",
    "yellowballs with _ wise _ region catalog matches span all four categories , with associations as follows : 185 k ( 31% ) , 62 g ( 10% ) , 144 c ( 24% ) , and 208 q ( 35% ) .",
    "the _ wise _ source class for each matched yellowball is shown in column  6 of table  [ tbl : ybocat ] .",
    "the rms catalog is the largest statistically selected catalog of young massive protostars and regions to date @xcite .",
    "it correlates spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths from the near - infrared to the radio regimes , uses rigorous color criteria to classify different types of objects , and , where possible , includes kinematic distance estimates and bolometric luminosities for catalog entries .",
    "the final catalog lists 11 categories of objects , including five categories associated with evolved star groups ( generic evolved stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , proto - planetary nebulae , oh / ir stars , and carbon stars ) ; four categories of young objects ( ysos , regions , /yso , and diffuse regions ) ; and two categories of ambiguous objects ( young / old sources and other ) .",
    "the catalog is thought to be complete for the detection of a b0  v star at the distance of the galactic center , although inclusion in the catalog is dependent upon detection of the source by _ msx _ and specific rms color criteria ( such as rising flux toward longer wavelengths in the _ msx _ bands ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that 95% of the galactic ultra - compact regions were detected , but more than 50% of the larger compact regions may be missing , although some of these might have been classified as `` diffuse regions '' in the rms catalog . therefore , the rms classification `` region '' should generally be interpreted as `` ultra - compact region '' , while `` diffuse region '' may in fact include compact regions .    to investigate association of yellowballs with rms objects ,",
    "we first cross - matched the yellowball list with the rms catalog using a cross - match distance corresponding to the size of each individual yellowball ( urquhart , private communication ) . of the 825 yellowballs that overlap the rms catalog ( 103 yellowballs lie within 10@xmath20 of the galactic center , and",
    "would therefore not be included in the rms catalog ) , 282 ( @xmath21 34% ) have rms matches ( see column 4 of table  [ tbl : ybocat ] ) .",
    "of the 282 yellowballs with rms matches , 155 ( 19% ) are positionally coincident with rms objects to within 5@xmath22 , indicating the yellowball is the main contributor to the luminosity of these sources .",
    "of these 155 yellowballs , 18 are classified as `` diffuse hii region '' , 4 as `` hii / yso '' , 17 as `` yso '' , and the remaining 116 as `` hii region '' in the rms catalog .",
    "no yellowballs are associated with any of the five evolved star groups or ambiguous objects in the rms catalog .",
    "all but 17 of the 155 yellowballs have bolometric luminosity estimates ; these span a broad range from 3.30@xmath23 - 1.8@xmath24 l@xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig : lum ] ) , with the vast majority of the yellowballs having luminosities expected for regions of massive star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : asize ] shows the distribution of physical sizes for the same sample of 138 yellowballs . for each yellowball",
    "an effective angular size was calculated using the average of @xmath26 and @xmath27 from table  [ tbl : ybo ] then converted to a physical size using distances from the rms catalog .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these sizes are strict upper limits to the sizes of any ionized regions within these objects for two reasons : ( 1 ) the size of each yellowball corresponds to the size of the user - drawn rectangle enclosing the yellowball , and ( 2 ) the yellowball is tracing the maximum extent of the pdr associated with each source so any enclosed region is necessarily smaller ( see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "this suggests that many of the smaller yellowballs are likely to contain ultra - compact regions or perhaps even hypercompact regions , identified with the earliest manifestations of ionized gas around young massive stars @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ybo ] presents two images from the mwp containing yellowballs with and without rms counterparts ( coincident to within 5@xmath22 ) .",
    "the top panel shows the central portion of w  33 , with a cluster of yellowballs located between two large infrared bubbles .",
    "yellowballs 541 and 880 are classified as `` yso '' and `` diffuse region '' , respectively , in the rms catalog , while yellowballs 49 and 542 are classified as regions .",
    "the latter are unresolved near the center of the image , with a `` lima - bean '' morphology .",
    "yellowball 450 is a known region , first detected as a 20 @xmath28 source by @xcite and characterized at cm radio wavelengths by @xcite , but it was not included in the rms catalog because it was not included in the _ msx _ catalog .    in the lower panel ,",
    "yellowballs 78 and 643 both have rms counterparts , and are classified as an `` region '' and `` yso '' respectively .",
    "in contrast , the other yellowballs in the field ( 63 and 697 ) fail the color criteria for inclusion in the rms catalog : both have _ msx _",
    "f(8 @xmath28 ) @xmath29 f(14 @xmath28 ) , which is likely due to them having a large pah ionization fraction ( see section  [ sec : discuss ] for more discussion ) .",
    "the mwp yellowball catalog provides a useful compliment to the rms survey .",
    "it similarly highlights regions of massive star formation , but our results suggest that the selection of objects purely on the basis of their infrared morphology and color in the higher - resolution _",
    "images ( cf . _ msx _ ) identifies a signature of compact star - forming regions shared across a broad range of luminosities , and by inference , masses .",
    "we performed an infrared color analysis in order to explore further the association of yellowballs with star - formation activity apparent both by visual inspection of mwp images and by the numerous catalog cross - matches outlined in the previous section . to rule out the possibility that these compact objects might be pne , we used color criteria developed by @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the 12  @xmath0 m to 8  @xmath0 m flux ratio , derived from _ wise _ and _ spitzer _ irac data respectively , is a robust discriminator for separating regions and planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the irac 8  @xmath0 m band is very sensitive to emission associated with the pah bands centered at 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m . in contrast , although the wise 12  @xmath0 m band does cover the 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7  @xmath0 m pah bands , its normalized response is relatively low ( @xmath30 ) at these wavelengths , and the peak sensitivity of the band lies at 14.5  @xmath0 m , longwards of most of the pah emission . given this combination of pah and filter properties , regions tend to have a lower 12/8 flux ratio than pne because their mid - infrared emission is dominated by strong , broad pah features , whereas pah features in pne tend to be narrower and relatively weaker @xcite .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on a representative sample of 183 yellowballs using _ spitzer _ 8 @xmath0 m & 24 @xmath0 m and _ wise _ 12 @xmath0 m band data .",
    "this sample was chosen using all yellowballs coincident with rms sources ( to within 5@xmath22 ) that were not saturated in mipsgal images at 24 @xmath0 m ( n=81 ) , and a comparable number of yellowballs without rms matches ( n=102 ) .",
    "the latter sample was chosen by selecting yellowballs with the highest ( n=52 ) and lowest ( n=50 ) hit rates , where the hit rate is defined by the ratio of the number of times a yellowball was identified by a volunteer to the number of times it was viewed . the rationale for choosing",
    "this sample was to allow us to investigate any potential differences based on hit rate . only objects viewed @xmath31 times , which have hit rates @xmath32 , are included in the list of 928 yellowballs .",
    "aperture photometry was done using the idl - based imview program @xcite .",
    "for extended infrared sources at low galactic latitude , especially those associated with star - formation activity , background estimation and subtraction is the most important source of photometric error as the infrared emission in the galactic plane is highly structured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "imview allows the user to select points that define the shape of the photometric aperture , and that constrain the surface fit used to estimate the background .",
    "the background fit can then be varied by selecting different background points and/or using different interpolating functions . for each source",
    "the average flux , using two different apertures and two different surface fits , was obtained and the standard deviation of the measurements was used as a measure of the uncertainty .",
    "the average flux density and uncertainty at 8 , 12 , and 24  @xmath0 m for each yellowball is reported in columns 2  7 of table  [ tbl : ybophot ] .",
    "the table is divided into three subsections corresponding to the rms - match sample , and the high and low hit rate non - rms samples .",
    "in addition , columns 8  11 of table  [ tbl : ybophot ] indicate whether the source has a cross - match in another catalog , and gives the _ wise _ catalog class if applicable .    in figure  [",
    "fig : wise ] we show a histogram of the resulting @xmath33 . the average value for this sample ( @xmath34 ) , and the average color for the sample of _ wise _ regions ( @xmath35 ) from @xcite are indicated .",
    "the photometric uncertainties are typically about half of a bin width ( @xmath36 ) , and the entire sample ( except for one yellowball with amorphous boundaries ) satisfies the robust f(12 @xmath0m)/f(8 @xmath0 m ) flux ratio criterion determined by @xcite to separate regions from pne at @xmath37 .",
    "we note that the rms and non - rms subsamples do not have identical distributions , specifically the average color of the non - rms yellowballs ( @xmath38 ) is more negative than the average of the rms - matched subsample ( @xmath39 ) , and a ks - test shows that the two samples are significantly different ( significance level @xmath40 ) .",
    "we also find that , within the non - rms sample , the high hit rate sample has an average color ( @xmath41 ) that is more negative than the low hit rate sample ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "again , a ks - test shows the two samples are signficantly different ( significance level @xmath40 ) .",
    "we discuss the likely cause of these color differences in the next section .",
    "we found that yellowballs have on average @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , median @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the average region spectrum shown in @xcite .",
    "the distinct mid - infrared appearance of the yellowballs in the glimpse / mipsgal images used in the mwp is not primarily due to the rough equality of the 8  @xmath0 m and 24  @xmath0 m fluxes mentioned in section  [ sec : photo ] , as this is expected for all regions , but comes about because the emission is spatially coincident .",
    "this spatial coincidence is expected in the early stages of the evolution of regions / pdrs .",
    "models predict that large pdrs will form around any initial ( dust - filled ) ionized region , and that the maximum size of the pdr , and the time at which the maximum size is obtained , are both relatively insensitive to stellar luminosity @xcite .",
    "for example , figure 9 of @xcite shows that the pdr associated with an region expanding into a molecular cloud having densities between 300 to 3000 @xmath46 will reach a maximum thickness of order 0.1 to 1 pc on timescales of @xmath47 years for a wide range of stellar luminosities .",
    "this size range of the model pdr , and the insensitivity of the model to stellar luminosity , are both consistent with the derived yellowball sizes and the range of luminosities presented in section 2.4 .",
    "as the region evolves the ionized region is expected to catch - up to the photo - dissociation front resulting in a thin , shocked region / pdr surrounding the region .",
    "much of the dust will be removed from the central portion of the region via the action of radiation pressure and stellar winds @xcite , and pahs will be destroyed within the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "this leads to a clear spatial separation between the @xmath48 emitting region ( pah - rich , pdr ) shown as green in the mwp images , and the @xmath49 emitting region ( depleted interior hot dust , perhaps resupplied by the erosion of denser clumps in the region ; @xcite ) shown as red in the mwp images .",
    "we noted in section  [ sec : photo ] that the yellowball sample has an average @xmath33 color that is more negative than the average color for the general region sample .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact the yellowball sample contains a higher fraction of compact objects with a large pah ionization fraction ( ybarra 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite showed that compact regions had a much higher 7.6/11.2 pah intensity ratio ( ranging from 5  11 ) compared to more evolved regions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this effect is related to the pah ionization fraction because the strength of the pah bands around 7 - 8  @xmath0 m is highly sensitive to the ionization state of the pahs ( becoming much stronger in ionized pahs ) , whereas the strength of pah bands at longer wavelengths are minimally affected by the ionization state @xcite .",
    "thus we would expect the @xmath33 color to become increasingly negative with increasing pah ionization fraction",
    ".    this may also be the cause of the shift in the average @xmath33 color from @xmath39 for rms - matched yellowballs to @xmath38 for yellowballs with no rms matches .",
    "the median size of the non - rms matched yellowballs was @xmath51 compared with @xmath52 for the rms - matched sources . assuming that the non - rms and rms - matched yellowballs have a similar distribution in distance , this implies that the non - rms sources are more compact on average .",
    "similarly we observed a difference in the average color of high ( @xmath41 ) and low hit rate ( @xmath42 ) yellowballs without rms matches .",
    "the median size of the high hit rate sample is @xmath53 compared with @xmath54 for the low hit rate sample . for the entire yellowball sample the correlation between hit rate and angular size is very weak ( correlation coefficient @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , as there are clearly other factors such as the proximity of the yellowball to other interesting objects , and the overall complexity of the field , that influence hit rate . given this weak correlation , if the two samples have a similar distribution in distances , then the high hit rate sample will have a higher proportion of physically compact objects leading to a more negative average @xmath33 color .",
    "as touched on in section  [ sec : ybo ] , it is clear that the rms catalog does not include some yellowballs that are definitely star - forming regions . to explore this",
    "further we cross - matched the 646 non - rms yellowballs with the _ msx _ catalog using a search radius of @xmath56 .",
    "of these 199 ( 31% ) did not have an _ msx _ catalog entry , 255 ( 39 % ) had poor quality ( s / n @xmath57 ) in band e ( 21.3 @xmath0 m ) , and the remaining 192 ( 30 % ) failed one or more of the msx color cuts described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this last subset is particularly interesting as it probably includes many compact objects with strong pah emission .",
    "the catalog cross - matches presented in this paper offer opportunities for a multitude of possible explorations . for example , consider the 138 yellowball - rms matches that have distance and luminosity estimates . of these objects , 35",
    "have bgps counterparts and 114 have atlasgal counterparts , indicating that nearly all yellowballs with rms entries are associated with dense gas .",
    "objects in this group span the range of luminosities seen in figure 2 . on the other hand , of the 208 yellowballs that are classified as radio - quiet objects in the _",
    "wise _ region catalog of @xcite , only 96 ( 46% ) have bgps or atlasgal counterparts and only 25 ( 12% ) have rms associations .",
    "twenty - two of the 25 rms - associated radio - quiet yellowballs have luminosity estimates , all of which are @xmath58 ( @xmath59 b0 zams equivalent ) , suggesting that many low - luminosity yellowballs were missed by these surveys .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these low - luminosity yellowballs is that they are associated with the formation of mid- to late- b stars , which are expected to have large , relatively long - lasting pdrs , combined with small , weak regions @xcite .",
    "the long lifetime of the pdrs in this case could explain why the percentage of yellowballs with dense gas associations is lower than that found for the rms - matched sample .",
    "intriguingly though , it is possible that some of these sources are massive protostars in a pre - ultra - compact region stage ; such protostars can exhibit low overall luminosities due to low core temperatures while at the same time having mid - infrared emission that would be visible as a yellowball ( e.g. , mol 160 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further high - resolution and high - sensitivity observations at infrared and radio wavelengths would help to distinguish between these two options by , for example , detecting outflows expected for massive protostars , or by detecting the small regions expected to be associated with the b - type stars .",
    "we have presented multiple lines of evidence that yellowballs are a mix of compact star - forming regions , including ultra - compact and compact regions , as well as analogous regions forming less massive stars .",
    "visual inspection of mwp images indicates these objects are typically found in irdcs and/or in bubble hierarchies , and their distribution in galactic longitude and latitude mirrors the distribution of mwp bubbles and young rms objects .",
    "color analysis of yellowballs using _ spitzer _ and _ wise _ data indicates that yellowballs occupy regions of infrared color space that include regions and exclude evolved objects such as pne .",
    "cross - matching the yellowballs with the atlasgal , bgps , _",
    "wise_- region , and rms catalogs , indicates that the majority of these objects are unambiguously associated with dense molecular clumps and other signposts of star formation .",
    "no yellowballs are associated with any of the evolved star categories in the rms catalog .",
    "we examined the luminosity and physical size distribution of a sample of 138 yellowballs with @xmath60 positional associations with rms catalog sources .",
    "these objects span at least 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity , and have luminosities consistent with massive star - forming regions .",
    "typical sizes for these yellowballs are comparable to compact regions ( sub - parsec in size ) ; however , we expect that these sizes are upper limits on the extent of the ionized gas as the size includes emission from the surrounding pdr .",
    "the great majority of these sources are ultra - compact regions or even younger / denser objects .",
    "the origin of the distinct yellow color of these objects in the glimpse / mipsgal mwp images is the cospatial emission from pahs and dust .",
    "this is expected for the earliest stages of massive star formation when pdrs will be at their thickest extent and various dust - clearing / destruction mechanisms within the ionized gas have had minimal time to act on the dust distribution .",
    "yellowballs are analogous to the `` green peas '' of the archetype galaxy zoo project , in the sense that they represent a class of objects identified and recorded by citizen science volunteers @xcite . just as the discovery and subsequent studies of green peas have yielded critical new insights into the evolution of galaxies @xcite , we expect that future studies of the yellowball sample will improve our understanding of how massive star - forming regions transition from compact embedded stages ( e.g. , massive protostars and ultra - compact regions ) to more evolved regions .",
    "similarly , those yellowballs associated with slightly lower - mass star formation will provide us with a comparable view of how these objects transition from highly embedded stars / clusters to larger bubble structures .",
    "we thank all mwp volunteers for their enthusiastic participation in this project , especially sandy harris , ipspieler , greg galanos , and larry west .",
    "we thank jason ybarra for pointing out that a high pah ionization fraction could produce more negative @xmath33 values based on his cloudy models , and thank sarah kendrew for the use of her correlation code .",

    "<S> yellowballs are a collection of approximately 900 compact , infrared sources identified and named by volunteers participating in the milky way project ( mwp ) , a citizen - science project that uses glimpse / mipsgal images from _ spitzer _ to explore topics related to galactic star formation . in this paper , through a combination of catalog cross - matching and infrared color analysis , we show that yellowballs are a mix of compact star - forming regions , including ultra - compact and compact regions , as well as analogous regions for less massive b - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting mwp yellowball catalog provides a useful complement to the red _ msx _ source ( rms ) survey . </S>",
    "<S> it similarly highlights regions of massive star formation , but the selection of objects purely on the basis of their infrared morphology and color in _ spitzer _ images identifies a signature of compact star - forming regions shared across a broad range of luminosities , and by inference , masses . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the origin of their striking mid - infrared appearance , and suggest that future studies of the yellowball sample will improve our understanding of how massive and intermediate - mass star - forming regions transition from compact to more extended bubble - like structures . </S>"
