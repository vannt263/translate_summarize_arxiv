    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has attracted a great deal of attention since its theoretical prediction by einstein in 1925 @xcite .",
    "initially , in the theoretical research on the phenomenon , the relativistic corrections are neglected near the bec transition temperature @xmath0 @xcite . lately , it is found that in the universe some systems consist of bosons of  very small rest mass .",
    "for example , the rest mass of a pair of neutrinos is about @xmath1 g in the neutrinos system @xcite . for such boson systems ,",
    "the relativistic effects should be considerable .",
    "so particular attention has been given to the behavior of the relativistic boson gas .",
    "the properties of the relativistic ideal boson gas ( ribg ) have been discussed in early papers @xcite . in 1965 ,",
    "landsberg and dunning - davies studied the critical temperature @xmath0 and the specific - heat anomaly at @xmath0 of the ribg @xcite . on the basis of the above works , beckmann _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the behavior of ribg with and without mass in all space dimensions ( d ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that for the massless gas , the specific - heat has a gap in @xmath2 , while for the massive gas , there was a gap in @xmath3 .",
    "although the research on the bec in the relativistic system has a long history , a complete treatment using the quantum field theory has not been carried out until 1980s , in which the pair creation of boson - antiboson is considered @xcite .",
    "haber and weldon firstly gave the high - temperature expansions for thermodynamic functions of the ribg by taking into account antibosons @xcite .",
    "frota and singh _ et al_. exhibited in detail the thermodynamic properties of d - dimensional system with antibosons @xcite .",
    "moreover , the more exact treatments of bec in ribg are given @xcite .",
    "recently , a relativistic bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature and finite temperature has been studied by the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the previous investigations on the properties of the relativistic boson gas were mainly focused on the systems in the absence of external potential . as we know , the external potential is very important to control the characteristics of the bose gas @xcite .",
    "_ discussed the bec of ribg in a general external potential by using classical hamiltonian @xcite . in this paper , we study the behavior of the ribg with and without antibosons in 3-d harmonic traps using the quantum theory .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ without ] , we study the bec transition temperature and helmholtz free energy at @xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , we also investigate the effects of the different values of mass on the bec of the ribg . in sec . [ with ] , we introduce antibosons and discuss the bec in such a system with antibosons , and sec . [ summary ] is a brief summary .",

    "can be given by@xmath13 in which @xmath14   , \\label{e0}\\\\ e^{(1 ) }   &   = \\frac{3\\hbar^{2}}{16mc^{2}}\\left [   n_{x}^{2}\\omega_{x}^{2}+n_{y}^{2}\\omega_{y}^{2}+n_{z}^{2}\\omega_{z}^{2}+n_{x}\\omega_{x}^{2}+n_{y}\\omega_{y}^{2}+n_{z}\\omega_{z}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left (   \\omega_{x}^{2}+\\omega_{y}^{2}+\\omega_{z}^{2}\\right )   \\right ]   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the planck constant , and @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are 3-d quantum numbers of the boson energy .",
    "to describe ribg in grand canonical ensemble , the usual expression for the number of particles @xmath4 in statistical mechanics is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath24 is the average number of bosons in the state of energy @xmath12 .",

    "the transition temperature is compared with the result based on the nonrelativistic approximation ( see fig .",

    "to our knowledge , at sufficiently high temperature the quantum field theory requires consideration of particle - antiparticle pair production . if @xmath39 is the number of antibosons , the system is governed by the conservation of the number @xmath40 , rather than of the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath39 separately . according to ref @xcite , @xmath41 for bosons we have @xmath42 and for antibosons",

    "this means as the decreasing of the temperature , bec of the system considering antibosons occurs firstly .",
    "it implies that the system with antibosons is more stable , i.e. , has a lower helmholtz free energy at @xmath0 .",
