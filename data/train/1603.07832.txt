    "m32 and vcc1297 are classical examples of a ce in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "these compact objects were thought to be extremely rare .",
    "for example , in the virgo cluster there are only a handful of possible ce candidates while more then 500 des are confirmed members by redshift measurements . an increasing number of ce populations located in different environments have been reported in recent works @xcite .",
    "most of them , however , are found in dense environments , particularly around massive galaxies .",
    "such proximity to a massive host favors a scenario in which they arise through the tidal stripping of larger galaxies , where the inner bulge component becomes a naked compact galaxy after losing its outer disk component during the interaction with its massive host @xcite .",
    "indeed , the discovery of ces with tidal debris near a massive host confirms this picture @xcite .",

    "[ htb ]    galaxies follow several scaling relations between their total mass and structural , kinematic and stellar population properties .",
    "it has been argued , with observational support , that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are present at the center of galaxies , and a correlation between the masses of smbhs and host galaxies bulge masses exists .",
    "however , there has been a debate on the universality of this relation at the low mass end .",
    "it is also not conclusive whether a majority of dwarf galaxies possess bhs at their centers , in addition to that most dwarf galaxies are bulge - less ( or pseudo - bulge ) galaxies . instead",

    ", width=321 ]          we primarily made use of the sdss - iii @xcite imaging data and catalog to explore the parameter space in searching for compact objects that we are interested in .",
    "we present the an optical images of ce_agn in figure [ gpic ] , a @xmath13 color composite taken from the sdss skyserver at the top and a cfht @xmath7band image at the bottom .",
    "we find that the sdss image quality is rather poor with an average seeing in @xmath14band of @xmath121 .",
    "the sdss measured half - light radius of ce_agn is 1.98 .",
    "therefore , to avoid any uncertainty in the derived structural parameters due to the resolution limit , we searched for higher quality images in other publicly available archival imaging databases .",
    "we found higher quality imaging data in the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) archive , with an average seeing of 0.6 \" , which was observed in the @xmath7band .",
    "we acquired the pre - processed , level 2 calibration , fits files which include dark current subtraction , flat normalization and the magnitude zero - point supplemented in the header .",
    "the observations were made as a part of the cfht very wide survey . with the seeing of 0.6 and a pixel scale of 0.18/pix , cfht data provides significantly higher image quality compared to the sdss observations .",
    "however , note that the cfht megacam images are known to have severe issues with sky background subtraction due to the mosaic pattern of multiple ccd chips .",
    "thanks to its compactness , our object extends entirely in one chip , thus sky - background subtraction becomes straightforward .    as we can see in figure [ gpic ] , a background ( z = 0.105 ) galaxy is located next to ce_agn .",
    "we removed the background contamination by subtracting its light from the fits image using the iraf @xmath15 and @xmath16 tasks .",
    "an unsharp masking technique has been applied to examine the presence of any substructural features such as spiral arm / bar or inner disk in ce_agn . finally , we used galfit @xcite to carry out a 2d multicomponent structural analysis where we modeled the light distribution with several different possible combinations , i.e one with a simple srsic function and the other with a double srsic function with or without a central gaussian point source . for the double srsic function",
    ", we fixed the outer component to be an exponential , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "a psf image , required by galfit , was prepared by stacking the stars found in the same field of view .",
    "foreground and background sources were masked by providing a mask image that we prepared manually .    with visual inspection of these residual images , we find that the use of a double srsic function provides a better fit , see top right panel of figure [ galfit ] .",
    "the inner component has a srsic index n = 1.4 and an effective radius of 1.58 .",
    "the outer component has an effective radius of 4.9 .",
    "the flux ratio between the inner and outer components , i.e. , bulge to disk ratio ( b / t ) , is 2.36 .    within the spatial resolution limit of the cfht image ,",
    "the presence of the central nucleus is not obvious , however , the addition of a central gaussian component in the galfit modeling slightly improves the fit in the inner region .",
    "the gaussian component light contribution is less than 1/50 of the bulge .",
    "a careful inspection of the unsharp - masked image and the model - subtracted residual images seems indicate the presence of an inner bar / disk - like structure .",
    "the ellipticity profile along the major axis shows a mild change and the maximum ellipticity coincides with the maximum change in position angle .    the global photometric parameters ( e.g. , half - light radius and total luminosity )",
    "are derived using a non - parametric approach .",
    "we follow a similar procedure as described in @xcite where the fluxes are summed up within a petrosian aperture .",
    "the k - band luminosity is derived from the 2mass archival images .",
    "the bulge luminosity is derived using the inner and outer component flux ratio . since the detailed decomposition has been done in cfht @xmath7band image",
    ", here we assume that the stellar population in ce_agn is homogenous .",
    "the results of photometry and structure modeling are listed in table [ htb ] .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic observation of ce_agn was done as part of the boss survey .",
    "the redshift measured by the sdss pipeline is z = 0.0140 .",
    "we exploit the optical spectrum of ce_agn for twofold .",
    "first , we aim to derive the properties of the underlying old stellar population using the information that is available in absorption features .",
    "second , we measure the mass of the central bh by analyzing the stellar continuum subtracted emission lines . for this , we first fitted the observed galaxy spectrum in a wavelength range from 4000 to 7000  with the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models from @xcite . in doing so ,",
    "prominent emission line regions were masked .",
    "for this purpose , we used a publicly available full spectrum fitting tool ulyss @xcite .",
    "an additive continuum of third order was added to account for a non - thermal continuum while matching the galaxy and ssp spectra .",
    "the quality of fit is shown in the lower panel figure [ sspfits ] , where the observed spectrum matches within 5% of the flux ; excluding the masked emission - line regions .",
    "the best fit ssp parameters are age = 9.95 gyr and log(z / z@xmath6 ) = @xmath20.12 dex .    finally , we reanalyzed the residual spectrum that mainly contains emission lines ( figure [ sspfits ] lower panel ) .",
    "the emission lines were de - blended into a narrow and a broad component by fitting multi - gaussian models .",
    "a single gaussian was used to model the narrow component of h@xmath3 , assuming the narrow component has the same profile and redshift as the [ nii ] doublet as shown in the inset of figure [ sspfits ] .",
    "however , for the [ o iii ] doublet ( @xmath18 4959 and @xmath18 5007 ) and the narrow component of h@xmath19 , we adopt double gaussians to account for the blue wing @xcite .",
    "for the broad components we use multiple gaussians , which yields fwhms of 1550 , 2400 km / s for the broad h@xmath19 and h@xmath3 components , respectively .",
    "finally we measured h@xmath3 and h@xmath19 narrow and broad emission fluxes from the best - fit narrow and broad component lines , respectively .",
    "having carefully measured the h@xmath3 and h@xmath19 flux from stellar continuum subtracted spectrum , the central black hole mass is measured by using the calibration provided by eq . 4 in @xcite where we replace h@xmath19 fwhm with h@xmath3 fwhm and l5100 is converted from the l(h@xmath3 ) , using the conversion factor in @xcite .",
    "the different normalization factors @xmath20 are assumed for classical bulge and pseudo bulge galaxies . with a srsic index @xmath21 ,",
    "ce agn may be neither a de vaucouleurs bulge ( @xmath22 ) nor an exponential disk ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore , we used the scaling factor that was derived from combining both types of galaxies .",
    "the derived bh mass is @xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainty for the bh mass measurement is approximately 0.4 dex which is mainly due to the uncertainty in the scaling factor .",
    "the distribution of sizes and luminosities for early - type galaxies is shown in the left panel of figure [ scl ] left .",
    "this plot is reproduced from @xcite where the data points were compiled from ( * ? ? ? * j08 ) for des , es and s0s , and ( * ? ? ? * c09 ) for ces .",
    "the solid line is a power - law fit to the size and luminosity within the brightness range @xmath24 mag .",
    "the dashed line is derived from the observed correlation between the central surface brightness and ( global ) srsic index with luminosity , and this , not surprisingly , provides a common scaling relation for es and des @xcite , albeit showing significant systematic offsets at intermediate luminosities @xcite .",
    "the two solid black circles are the isolated ces previously identified in @xcite .",
    "the red symbol is newly added from this work .",
    "we can clearly see that ce_agn overlaps with the previously identified ces ( black dots and solid gray squares ) .",
    "ce_agn falls significantly below the curved size - luminosity relation of es / des , and rather continues the sequence of giant ellipticals shown by a solid black line . in other words , with the high mean surface brightness , @xmath25 = 19.36 mag / arcsec@xmath26 for its total brightness of m@xmath1 = -18.08 mag , it also follows the so - called kormendy relation ( magnitude vs surface brightness ) of giant ellipticals @xcite .    in the right panel of figure [ scl ]",
    ", we show the two scaling relations between the bh masses and the host galaxies properties . in the left , a well - known correlation between bh mass and k - band bulge luminosity of the host galaxy is shown @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , a relation between bh mass and srsic index , as proposed by @xcite , is shown in the right panel . in both plots",
    ", ce_agn seems to roughly follow the observed trends , and interestingly , it almost overlaps with m32 which is shown by a large filled - gray square .",
    "we present a new compact early - type galaxy , ce_agn with optical signature of an accreting bh . among the ce or de class galaxies ,",
    "ce_agn is the first which possesses the broad - line emission of width larger than 2000 km / s .",
    "below , we discuss its distinction and the possible origin .",
    "agns are not common in low - mass early - type galaxies ( de or ce classes ) . according to a common wisdom these galaxies are devoid of gas and have less chance of acquiring gas from external sources as massive galaxies do ,",
    "thus there is no fuel left to trigger the nuclear activity .",
    "nevertheless , the number of detections of bhs in low - mass galaxies has been increased in recent literature with the advent of large scale surveys , high precision instruments and the sophisticated modeling of the host galaxy and bh kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite identified a dwarf seyfert 1 agn candidate , pox 52 , at redshift z = 0.021 .",
    "they classified the host galaxy morphology to be a dwarf elliptical and reported a bh mass of 1.5 @xmath4 10@xmath27 m@xmath6 . in the last few years , number of searches",
    "have been devised to list dwarf galaxies with central massive bhs @xcite . in particular",
    ", the study of @xcite presents the largest number of nearby dwarf galaxies which exhibit optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting bhs . visually classifying these bh - host dwarf galaxies located within z @xmath28 0.02",
    ", we find that 13 out of 33 can be classified as de or ds0 .",
    "only one , j122342.82 + 581446.4 , has a broad h@xmath3 emission similar to that of ce_agn .",
    "@xcite estimate its bh mass @xmath1210@xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "the majority of ces are found in the vicinity of giant galaxies , e.g. , m32 , and many of them possess morphological features which might have originated from tidal stripping activity @xcite . with the discovery of an isolated ce by @xcite , an alternative scenario ,",
    "other than stripping , has gained much attention in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "ce_agn is also located away from the nearest massive galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a fly - by scenario where those isolated compact ellipticals may be tidally - stripped systems that ran away from their hosts .",
    "the discovery of a ce with agn signature might help us to explore another aspects of compact early - type galaxies .",
    "bulge - dominated early - type galaxies follow a scaling relation between bulge mass and bh mass .",
    "measuring the bh mass allows us to locate the position of ces in this relation .",
    "we find nothing uncommon , as ce_agn is placed near m32 , following the overall relation between bh mass and bulge mass ( see figure [ scl ] right ) .",
    "m32 is a local group ce located at the vicinity of m31 which has been an iconoclast example of ce type galaxy @xcite .",
    "based on x - ray and radio observations , presence of the nuclear activity has also been reported in m32 @xcite .",
    "it has been long argued that m32 is a stripped bulge of a disk galaxy @xcite  but also see @xcite . as a hypothesis proposed by @xcite , the possibility that ce_agn might also be a tidally stripped bulge that ran away from its hosts , perhaps from ngc 2672 group ,",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "ngc 2672 is a relatively massive galaxy group with a viral mass of @xmath1210@xmath29m@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the member galaxies could be spread out as far as a couple of mpc in projected distance @xcite .",
    "however , given the large physical separation between ce_agn and ngc 2672 , the stripping event might have happened either very early in time or at fast speed with a very eccentric orbit .",
    "the small relative velocity to ngc 2672 might be explained by an orbit in the plane of the sky and ce_agn being close to apogalacticon .",
    "other hand , it is remarkable to see that while following the extension of mass  size relation of massive early - type galaxies , ce_agn also seems to follow the observed empirical relation between the bulge srsic index and the bh mass suggested by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a detailed decomposition of the light profile by @xcite reveals that m32 s light profile resembles an almost perfect bulge - exponential disk system where the bulge component has a srsic index of @xmath31 , which is in agreement with the relation between the srsic index and the bh mass .",
    "considering the location in the scaling relations , we suggest ce_agn is a low luminosity extension of es .",
    "it is , though , not sufficient to rule out the stripping scenario and to support the alternative scenario which assumes a similar evolutionary path as es , formed possibly via mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we expect that a detailed study of the underlying stellar population and central kinematics from high quality 2-dimensional spectroscopy may allow us to test the above conclusions which we plan to do for the coming observing semester .",
