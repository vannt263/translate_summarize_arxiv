    "the symbol @xmath1 stands for the sobolev space of @xmath2 integrable mappings with @xmath2 integrable first order derivatives .",
    "this class of mappings was considered for the first time as early as in 1948 by morrey @xcite in his celebrated paper on regularity of minimizing harmonic mappings from two dimensional surfaces into manifolds . while it is a well known theorem of meyers and serrin that smooth functions are dense in the sobolev space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a riemannian manifold , similar question , raised by eells and lemaire , @xcite , about density of smooth mappings in the class of sobolev mappings between manifolds",
    "is no longer obvious .",
    "actually schoen and uhlenbeck @xcite , @xcite were the first to observe that in general the answer to this question is in the negative .",
    "namely they demonstrated that the radial projection mapping @xmath5 , @xmath6 , can not be approximated by @xmath7 mappings when @xmath8 . in the same paper they proved that @xmath9 is a dense subset of @xmath0 when @xmath10 and @xmath4 , @xmath11 are compact smooth manifolds , @xmath12 .",
    "later , mainly due to the work of bethuel , @xcite , it turned out that the condition for the density of smooth mappings can be formulated in terms of algebraic topology describing the topological structure of the manifolds @xmath4 and @xmath11 .",
    "finally a necessary and sufficient condition for the density of smooth mappings in the space of sobolev mappings @xmath0 was discovered by hang and lin @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this result corrects an earlier statement of bethuel @xcite about a necessary and sufficient condition for the density .",

    "every sobolev mapping @xmath18 can be approximated by smooth mappings @xmath19 , but it is not always possible to choose the approximating sequence to have values in @xmath11 .",

    ". one of the requirements is , however , that the metrics be bi - lipschitz equivalent . actually , from the point of view of analysis on metric spaces , spaces which are bi - lipschitz homeomorphic are equivalent .",

    "they write : _ because of ( [ equiv ] ) both the definitions of the lebesgue space @xmath40 , and the sobolev space @xmath41 do not depend on the choice between the carnot ",

    "they are perfectly right when they say that the set does not depend on the choice of the metric in the target as long as the metrics that are considered are bi - lipschitz equivalent , like those in ( [ equiv ] ) . however , if one equips the space of the sobolev mappings @xmath25 from a manifold into a metric space with a metric that comes from the isometric embedding of @xmath26 into a banach space ( as was done in @xcite ) it is not clear how changing the metric in @xmath26 to a bi - lipschitz equivalent one would affect the metric structure of the space @xmath25 .",
    "our paper is devoted to study this problem .",
    "easy examples show that different isometric embeddings of @xmath26 into banach spaces may give different metrics in @xmath25 equipped with the norm @xmath43 is a banach space and @xmath44 , @xmath45 if @xmath46 , @xmath47 if @xmath48 is an isometric embedding .",

    "two closed manifolds can be identified if they are diffeomorphic . in the case of metric spaces",
    "a natural counterpart of a diffeomorphism is a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism .",
    "this is the class of the `` most smooth '' homeomorphisms that can be considered for arbitrary metric spaces .",
    "many of the metric spaces @xmath26 admit a bi - lipschitz embedding into the euclidean space @xmath13 , rather than an isometric one .",
    "in such a case one could try to use this embedding to define the space @xmath25 by ( [ 719 ] ) .",
