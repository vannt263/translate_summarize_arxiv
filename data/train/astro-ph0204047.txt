    "lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) represent the sites of a significant fraction of the star formation in the early universe ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2000 ) and the ultraviolet ( uv ) derived star formation rates ( sfrs ) of lbgs have become an important component of the recent attempts to measure the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et al . 1999 ; lanzetta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "precisely how the uv emission of lbgs are corrected for the effects of intrinsic dust attenuation , which requires a knowledge about the true nature of these objects , is critical for estimating star formation rate densities at @xmath0 .",
    "starburst galaxies are the most likely local analogs to the population of lbgs at high redshift .",
    "lbgs have uv surface brightnesses and uv colors similar to local starbursts ( meurer et al .",
    "1997 ) suggesting that lbgs can be considered as larger and more luminous versions of the nearby variety .",
    "further evidence in support of the analogy comes from the only high quality rest - frame uv spectrum of an individual lbg ",
    "the gravitationally lensed ms 1512 + 36-cb58  which shows emission and absorption features remarkably consistent with local starbursts ( pettini et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "local starburst galaxies exhibit an empirical correlation between their uv spectral slope ( @xmath1 ; equivalent to uv color ) and their infrared excess ( irx ; ratio of far - ir to far - uv flux ) .",
    "this relationship implies that starbursts redden as dust absorption increases and that dust surrounding starburst regions can be modeled to provide an estimate of the uv extinction as a simple linear function of the uv color ( meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter mhc99 ) .",
    "although the uv properties of lbgs can be readily measured from deep optical imaging , obtaining rest - frame far - ir data for these high redshift galaxies is extraordinarily difficult .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether or not the irx-@xmath1 reddening relationship is a meaningful tool that may be used to estimate the uv extinction of high redshift galaxies . until rest - frame far - ir data become available for a significant sample of lbgs , we must attempt to probe other accessible wavelength windows that may provide clues about the thermal dust emission .",
    "x - rays can be just such a proxy .    in this paper , we investigate the suggested starburst nature of lbgs by considering their x - ray emission and the consequences for uv extinction .",
    "to do this , we first use a local sample of normal and starburst galaxies to demonstrate a clear correlation between the bolometric and 28 kev x - ray luminosities when the bolometric output is dominated by far - ir and far - uv emission .",
    "we then test the starburst concept for lbgs by applying the starburst derived irx-@xmath1 relationship to a sample of 24 lbgs in order to predict their x - ray emission .",
    "specifically , we estimate the far - ir luminosity using the starburst uv reddening relationship and then estimate the x - ray luminosity from the bolometric to x - ray correlation .",
    "these results are compared to the recent 1 ms exposure chandra deep field north ( cdf - n ) x - ray constraints of brandt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the same sample .",
    "it is possible that the uv properties of lbgs are only superficially starburst - like .",
    "perhaps they are the uv - bright portion of ` scaled - up ' ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) and the majority of uv light generated by star formation is heavily extincted and not detected in rest - uv surveys ( e.g. , goldader et al .",
    "certainly the irregular morphology of lbgs is consistent with the notion that they are recent mergers or interacting systems .",
    "alternatively , lbgs may be youthful proto - galaxies in the process of forming the spheroids destined to become the central bulges of spirals or elliptical galaxies .",
    "if so , lbgs could be relatively free from the effects of dust because they have not yet been enriched with a significant quantity of heavy elements .",
    "these scenarios represent the extremes of uv extinction in lbgs and , consequently , extremes of their estimated star formation rates ( sfrs ) as well .",

    "argue that the lack of a significant irx-@xmath1 correlation results from the fact that the majority of far - uv light detected from uligs originates from the least extincted sources ( possibly just the outermost regions of star formation ) and is not coincident with the dust - enshrouded starburst activity responsible for the far - ir emission .    to test the likelihood of lbgs being similar to these type of extremely dusty starbursts , we randomly assigned log irx values in the 23.5 range to each lbg ( hashed region of figure  2 ) and followed the same aforementioned procedure to predict the x - ray luminosities .",
    "our method predicts the mean x - ray luminosity for the sample to be @xmath67erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ( figure  3 : panel  b ) .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude larger than the observed value and strongly suggests that lbgs are not hiding a significant amount of star formation behind a veil of dust .",
    "in fact , @xmath68% of the sample would have x - ray fluxes greater than the single source soft - band detection limit , with half being at least an order of magnitude larger .",
    "furthermore , if lbgs truly have ulig - like irx values then the observed far - uv fluxes imply fir luminosities in the @xmath69@xmath70 l@xmath53 range . using the method described by adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) we estimate that 96% of the sample would have rest - frame @xmath71  flux densities greater than the 2 mjy detection limit for the hdf - n sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) survey conducted by hughes et al .",
    "lbgs , however , have so far proven to be elusive to sub - mm observers ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "2000 ; hughes et al , 1998 ) .",
    "the recent sub - mm _ stacked _ analysis of lbgs by webb et al .",
    "( 2002 ) provides a mean sub - mm @xmath72 detection of only 0.414 mjy .",
    "if lbgs consist of early generation stellar populations , then low metallicity ( smc - type ) dust may be appropriate for modeling their global far - ir emission . this would be consistent with the metallicity of the lensed lbg ms 1512 + 36-cb58 ( @xmath73 ) as constrained by pettini et al .",
    "we test this idea is with the radiative transfer dust models of witt & gordon ( 2000 ) .",
    "we compute the expected irx and uv spectral slope from starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) synthetic starburst spectrum after applying extinction effects based on two witt & gordon models for smc - dust in a shell geometry .",
    "the first model assumes a homogeneous dust distribution in the surrounding dust shell while the second involves a non - homogeneous clumpy distribution .",
    "the adopted starburst99 spectrum is chosen to be consistent with the low metallicity assumption .",
    "it is parameterized by a continuous star formation rate , a salpeter imf with slope @xmath74 , an upper mass limit of 100 m@xmath53 , metallicity of @xmath75 , and a burst age of 100 myr .",
    "the bolometric dust luminosity is computed as the sum of the energy from extincted non - ionizing photons plus the energy deposited from _ all _ ly@xmath76 photons .",
    "we estimate the ly@xmath76 production , prior to any extinction , by assuming that each ionizing photon generates one ly@xmath76 photon ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the luminosity in the fir bandpass is estimated with bc@xmath35 .",
    "the resulting uv reddening relation for the homogeneous dust model is similar in shape to the irx-@xmath1 relation of mhc99 , but has a slightly less steep slope and is offset to lower values of irx for a values of @xmath77 ( dot - dash line of figure  2 ) .",
    "the uv reddening relation from the alternative clumpy dust distribution is also qualitatively similar to mhc99 but , compared to the homogeneous model , rises faster in irx before it turns over near @xmath78 and obtains a similar shallow slope ( dashed line in figure  2 ) .",
    "for lbgs in our sample with @xmath79 , the clumpy model predicts larger values of irx than the irx-@xmath1 relation of mhc99 .",
    "having defined the uv reddening relation expected for the dust models , we again use the same technique to predict the x - ray luminosities of the lbg sample .",
    "the homogeneous model slightly under predicts the mean x - ray luminosity ( @xmath80erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ) compared to the observed value . within strict error limits ( model and observed )",
    "the homogeneous model agrees with the observation .",
    "the clumpy model slightly over predicts it ( @xmath81erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ) , but the observed mean is well within the @xmath44 error .",
    "the histogram in panel  c ( panel  d ) of figure  3 represents the homogeneous ( clumpy ) model . to within the uncertainties in our technique ,",
    "we are unable to differentiate between the empirically derived relation of mhc99 and either of the smc - dust / shell geometry models .",
    "witt & gordon claim that the clumpy model reproduces the effective starburst attenuation curve of calzetti ( 1997 ; calzetti et al .",
    "we have calculated the uv reddening relation for the calzetti attenuation curve ( dotted line of figure  2 ) using the same method and find it very similar to the clumpy model over the narrow range of @xmath1 measured for the lbgs .",
    "when we use the calzetti effective attenuation to predict x - ray emission , we find the mean luminosity ( @xmath82erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ) is essentially the same as that from the clumpy model and also in agreement with the observed value ( figure  3 : panel  e )",
    ".    we should note the effect our choice of intrinsic starburst model has on the computed uv reddening relations . choosing a higher metallicity ( i.e. @xmath83 ) stellar population will produce a redder intrinsic ( unextincted ) spectral slope ( @xmath84 ) but would have little effect on irx values for @xmath77 .",
    "differences in either burst age or the imf upper mass limit will effect both @xmath85 and irx in the sense that older bursts or smaller upper mass limits will redden @xmath85 and lower irx .",
    "this would then result in a smaller predicted x - ray flux for the lbg sample .",
    "we can use the machinery we have developed to test the extreme hypothesis that lbgs suffer no far - uv extinction .",
    "if the lbg sample is actively forming stars and harbors little or no dust , we can reasonably assume that the far - uv flux is unattenuated and dominates the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the reddened uv colors must then be interpreted as a simple effect of burst age . although continuous star formation modes could not easily account for the range of @xmath1 measured in the lbg sample , instantaneous burst modes with ages between @xmath86 myr can naturally redden enough to explain the observed uv properties ( leitherer et al .",
    "however , under this scenario , the mean x - ray luminosity is under predicted by a factor of 6 ( @xmath87erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ) . given the large observational and model uncertainties the difference is @xmath88 ( figure  3 : panel  f ) .",
    "evidence is beginning to emerge that 28 kev x - rays are a good star formation rate indicator ( ranalli et al .",
    "2002 ) . in local starbursts ,",
    "the 28 kev x - ray emission is believed to be produced primarily by high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ; persic & rephaeli 2002 ) .",

    "2002 ) or a new class of intermediate mass ( @xmath90@xmath91 m@xmath53 ) black holes , may also contribute to the 28 kev flux .",
    "furthermore , 28 kev x - rays suffer little intrinsic absorption and can escape regions where the far - uv tracers of star formation may be heavily extincted by a dusty interstellar medium . for these reasons ,",
    "the 28 kev x - ray luminosity strongly correlates with the bolometric luminosity of star forming galaxies .",
    "this means that 28 kev x - rays can serve as a proxy for the far - ir thermal dust emission at high-@xmath92 .",
    "we have derived the bolometric to 28 kev x - ray correlation for a local sample of normal and starburst galaxies and have used it , in combination with several uv reddening schemes , to predict the mean 28 kev x - ray luminosity for a sample of 24 spectroscopically confirmed high redshift lyman - break galaxies .",
    "this simple analysis demonstrates that lbgs can not have far - ir to far - uv flux ratios similar to those found for nearby uligs , nor are they likely to be unattenuated by dust . of the extinction methods considered , we find that the irx-@xmath1 starburst reddening relation of mhc99 is the most accurate predictor of the mean x - ray luminosity for the sample .",

    "these results provide additional evidence that lbgs can be considered as scaled - up local starbursts . equally important",
    ", it suggests that irx-@xmath1 may be a reasonable tool for estimating the uv extinction of high redshift lbgs .",
    "if this is the case , all 24 lbgs in this sample have @xmath93 mag with a mean ( median ) of 1.4 ( 1.5 ) mag implying a mean 1600  dust correction factor of @xmath94 .",
    "this moderate level of uv extinction is consistent with the results of papovich et al .",

    "<S> we derive the bolometric to x - ray correlation for a local sample of normal and starburst galaxies and use it , in combination with several uv reddening schemes , to predict the 28 kev x - ray luminosity for a sample of 24 lyman - break galaxies in the hdf / cdf - n . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean x - ray luminosity , as predicted from the meurer uv reddening relation for starburst galaxies , agrees extremely well with the brandt _ stacking _ analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this provides additional evidence that lyman - break galaxies can be considered as scaled - up local starbursts and that the locally derived starburst uv reddening relation may be a reasonable tool for estimating the uv extinction at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the lyman - break sample can not have far - ir to far - uv flux ratios similar to nearby uligs , as this would predict a mean x - ray luminosity 100 times larger than observed , as well as far - ir luminosities large enough to be detected in the sub - mm . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the uv reddening expected from the calzetti effective starburst attenuation curve and the radiative transfer models of witt & gordon for low metallicity dust in a shell geometry with homogeneous or clumpy dust distributions and find that all are consistent with the observed x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the mean x - ray luminosity of the sample would be under predicted by a factor of 6 if the the far - uv is unattenuated by dust . </S>"
