    "the discovery of exoplanets has yielded many surprises with regards to their properties in comparison with the planets in our solar system . amongst these",
    "are planets in highly eccentric orbits ( @xmath1 ) , such as 16  cyg  b  b @xcite and hd  80606b @xcite .",
    "the number of detected exoplanets is sufficient to note a divergence from circular orbits which occurs beyond a semi - major axis of @xmath2  au @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that this correlation is also present in the exoplanetary candidates discovered by the kepler mission @xcite , along with evidence that eccentricities tend to decrease with decreasing planetary size . for planets below the size of neptune ,",
    "orbits are more likely to be circular since these planets can not efficiently excite the eccentricities of other planets so collisions are favored over scattering @xcite .",
    "the more efficient tidal dissipation in this regime also leads to shorter tidal circularization time scales @xcite .",
    "the discovery of planets in highly eccentric orbits , particularly in multi - planet systems , presented a challenge for formation and dynamical models .",
    "significant progress has been made in the meantime towards understanding these interesting systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for multi - planet systems , additional constraints are imposed on eccentricity values due to the requirement that the system remain dynamically stable .",
    "dynamical interactions of multi - planet systems in the context of eccentricity and formation models have been investigated by numerous authors @xcite . from the known multi - planet systems , there are four in particular which stand out with respect to the diversity of eccentricities present within the system .",
    "these are the hd  37605 @xcite , hd  74156 @xcite , hd  163607 @xcite , and hd  168443 @xcite systems .",
    "each of these systems contain two giant planets where the inner planet has an eccentricity larger than 0.5 whereas the orbit of the outer planet is much closer to circular .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that dynamical interactions between exoplanets can also result in subsequent radial velocity variations that diverge from keplerian orbital assumptions .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the dynamical history and stability of these systems as well as scenarios for their origins .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of these four systems with high eccentricity diversity . in section 2",
    "we summarize the orbital configurations and system parameters for the systems discussed in this study . in section 3",
    "we utilize the radial velocity solutions for these systems to place quantitative limits on additional planets in each system .",
    "section 4 presents the dynamical analysis of each system including the oscillations of the planet orbital eccentricities and associated periastron precession . in section 5 we discuss the effects of mutual inclinations on the dynamical stabilities .",
    "section 6 attempts to explore the origins of systems with such eccentricity diversity based on our simulations .",
    "we discuss further implications of these analyses in section 7 and then provide concluding remarks in section 8 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     an aspect of interest in the orbital configurations of the systems studied here is the origin and subsequent evolution of those orbits ( see section [ origin ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that finding these kinds of systems at a particular epoch can have a low associated probability .",
    "for example , figure [ hd37605fig ] reveals that the c planet in the hd  37605 system spends the majority of its orbit at a significantly higher eccentricity than that which is currently observed .",
    "it is also unlikely that the planets would have formed in such orbits without significant transfers of angular momentum to an additional component ( stellar or planetary ) no longer present in the system .",
    "thus , an important property of these systems with eccentricity diversity is the angular momentum deficit ( amd ) , which is the difference in angular momentum of the system compared with the angular momentum if the planets were in circular orbits with the same semi - major axes .",
    "this is given by the following equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit for planet @xmath5 . in cases",
    "where @xmath6 , such as hd  37605 , the inner planet has much less orbital angular momentum than the outer planet resulting in larger eccentricity oscillations for a given amd value .",
    "the system with the smallest eccentricity oscillations is hd  74156 . as noted in section [ hd74156 ] , this is also the system with the highest planetary mass ratio and eccentricity of the outer planet .",
    "these facts combined with the relatively slow periastron precession of the outer planet are consistent with the findings of @xcite that the system is unlikely to possess unstable configurations .",
    "calculations of the amd for these systems show that the hd  74156 system has a substantially higher ( factor of 2 ) amd than the other three .",
    "the various types of apsidal motion in interacting exoplanetary systems have been investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite distinguish between two basic types of apsidal behavior , libration and circulation , where the boundary between them is referred to as a secular separatrix .",
    "this distinction may be used as an additional tool in characterizing the long - term behavior of keplerian orbital elements of multi - planet systems .",
    "figure [ epsilon ] represents the apsidal trajectory graphically for the four systems discussed here .",
    "the plot uses the eccentricity of the inner and outer planets ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ) and the difference in periastron arguments ( @xmath9 ) to create a polar representation of the apsidal behavior .",
    "this shows that the apsidal modes of hd  74156 and hd  168443 are circulating since the polar trajectories encompass the origin .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively small amplitude of the c planet eccentricity evolutions shown in figures [ hd74156fig ] and [ hd168443fig ] .",
    "conversely , hd  37605 and hd  163607 are shown to be librating systems and are close to the separatrix between secular libration and circulation .",
    "this is also consistent with figures [ hd37605fig ] and [ hd163607fig ] since those show that the c planet eccentricities regularly approach zero .",
    "finally , it is worth considering as to whether the oscillations described here in both the eccentricity and periastron precession may be detectable in reasonable timescales .",
    "the high - frequency secondary oscillations in the eccentricity of the outer planet , such as hd  37605 and hd  168443 , are of relatively low amplitude .",
    "the orbital precession of exoplanets has been previously investigated by @xcite who found that the timescales for such precession is unlikely to allow detection except for the very short - period planets . by comparison ,",
    "the perihelion precessions of mercury and earth are 0.159/century and 0.321/century respectively @xcite . for the cases presented in section [ dynamics ] ,",
    "the period of eccentricity oscillation and periastron precession are at least several centuries in even the most optimistic cases .",
    "the main hindrance however is that the uncertainties associated with those parameters tend to be comparable to the expected variations .",
    "exoplanet discoveries are leading to a diverse range of multi - planet system configurations . here",
    "we have concentrated on a particular configuration which consists of two planets in which the inner planet has an eccentricity larger than 0.5 . as shown in section [ system ] , these systems bear many similarities , in particular the ratio of the outer to inner planet semi - major axes which is likely a constraint imposed by the unique dynamics present in these systems . through an examination of the residuals to",
    "the radial velocity fits to the data , we are able to exclude the presence of planets with masses larger than @xmath10 with orbital periods less than 1000 days at the 3@xmath11 level .",
    "our n - body integrations of each system show that there is a synchronous transfer of angular momentum between the planets in most cases .",
    "the case of hd  74156 is interesting due to the high mass ratio , the relatively small amplitude of eccentricity oscillation and periastron precession of the outer planet , and the relatively high amd for the system .",
    "the high - frequency secondary eccentricity oscillations for the outer planets is indicative of outer planet responses to frequent dynamical interactions with the much shorter period inner planet .",
    "the effect of introducing a mutual inclination is to increase the amplitude of secondary oscillations in the inner planet until that planet is subsequently ejected from the system .",
    "the amds of these systems provide indications that these systems have indeed had a significant perturbation event which produced these relatively rare orbital configurations . as more of these kinds of systems",
    "are discovered , we can gain further understanding as to their frequency and dynamical histories .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the quality of the paper .",
    "this research has made use of the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org .",
    "this research has also made use of the nasa exoplanet archive , which is operated by the california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration under the exoplanet exploration program .",
