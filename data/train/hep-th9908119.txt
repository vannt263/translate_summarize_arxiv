    "in ordinary quantum field theory ( qft ) with mass gap the notion of particle is recovered from that of interacting local field as a consequence of infra - red ( ir ) asymptotic dynamics : a near - mass - shell pole singularity in each of the momenta incoming any green function ( guaranteed in lagrangian qft s by the possibility of imposing on - shell normalization conditions on both mass and wave function renormalizations ) ensures the existence of the lehmann - symanzik - zimmerman asymptotic limit of the field @xmath3 .",
    "one is thus provided with a ordinary free fock field , by means of which an irreducible representation _  l _ wigner of poincar group , sitting on an isolated mass hyperboloid , is in turn constructed . in this context",
    "the fact that the field / particle may or may not carry quantum numbers associated with some unbroken global internal symmetry is irrelevant .    in gauge theories ( we will always have in mind qed and qcd in continuum minkowski 4-dimensional space - time with unbroken electric and colour charges ) things go in a different way .",
    "indeed , the issue is one about which , as yet , there is no general consensus .    on the one side qed  with the exception of its zero charge sector  still is only a theory of inclusive cross sections , in which all the theoretical set - up of quantum mechanics ( states , observables , representation of symmetries and the like ) has no satisfactory _ explicit _ representation , in spite of the general model - independent investigations @xmath4 that have delimitated , so to speak , a possible battlefield : the battle is not yet won and one could , in a provocative way , summarize the situation by saying that the question : `` what is an electron in qed '' is still open .    on the other side",
    "there is , in qcd , the problem of confinement of coloured gluons and quarks , about which there is even less to say .",
    "many mechanisms and criteria have been proposed over the years : some ( as _ e.g. _ the wilson loop area behaviour @xmath5 , or the fundamental role of topology leading to the dual meissner effect @xmath6 ) are so suggestive that have become common language ; others ( the @xmath7 ir behavior of the full gluon propagator @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the quartet mechanism @xmath10 and the metric confinement @xmath11 both based on the existence of lsz asymptotic limits for colour fields , violation of asymptotic completeness @xmath12 , the obstruction in the ir dressing due to gribov ambiguities @xmath13 , and so many others that it would be impossible - and nonsensical - to quote them all here ) do not share the same popularity , but time and again are reconsidered and revived .",
    "however , so far none of these criteria has led to a systematic and generally accepted description of what confinement is .",
    "prudentially we regard confinement as a delicate , multi - faceted subject one can look at from different standpoints .",
    "we try here just to offer a further standpoint , not necessarily in conflict with others , but endowed with the possibility of a sound mathematical verification based on the only input of implementing in qcd the symmetries that we believe relevant : local gauge invariance and poincar .",
    "it is convenient to state the terms of the problem of the particle content of charged sectors in gauge theories within the framework of the lagrangian approach .",
    "we shall also assume that all the fields entering the lagrangian are local fields .",
    "these will be referred to as the basic fields of the model .",
    "@xmath14 gives in detail the local covariant formulation of the theory we shall rely on in the sequel .",
    "in particular the adjective `` physical '' will be referred to the fields that commute with  or to states that are annihilated by  the becchi",
    "stora  tyutin generator ( the choice of the local covariant formulation deserves a further comment : the fact that manifest covariance is necessary to implement the renormalization procedure may be regarded upon as a technical complication ; to our knowledge , however , a proof of renormalizability is given only in this context @xmath15 :",
    "that is why we stick to it ) .    in this context",
    "it is convenient to distinguish four steps , all relevant in designing the relationship between field and particle .",
    "we will try to keep these steps as non - overlapping as possible :    \\(i ) form of physical ( composite ) charged fields ;    \\(ii ) ir asymptotic dynamics ;    \\(iii ) existence of asymptotic limits and particle content ;    \\(iv ) @xmath16 matrix .    in this paper",
    "we will be mainly concerned with only ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "as for ( i ) , it is well known that physical fields that are localized functions of the basic fields transform trivially ( _ i.e. _ have zero charge ) under any charge operator associated to a current obeying a gauss law : @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , in intuitive terms , thanks to the latter , the action of the charge on any field @xmath18 takes the form @xmath19       \\label{gl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath21 in 3-space .",
    "therefore , if @xmath18 is ( or the fields in terms of which it is constructed are ) smeared with functions of compact support , thanks to locality , @xmath22 vanishes for @xmath21 large enough . to avoid this",
    "the field @xmath18 must have a `` tail '' through the sphere at infinity in minkowski space ( whether only in space - like or even in time - like directions is a subject to be taken up in the next section ) . in this sense , as long as one is interested in physical nontrivially charged fields , only nonlocalized functions of the basic fields ought to be considered .",
    "since the above statement has been given the status of a theorem @xmath23 , there is little to add and there is general agreement about it .",
    "the theorem gives no hint , however , about the explicit form of such fields .",
    "according to the terminology also recently used in ref .",
    "@xmath13 , such nonlocalized functions will be shortly referred to as `` dressed '' fields : a physical , _ interacting _ electron should be dressed with a cloud of photons , as well as with its own coulomb field .",
    "dirac @xmath24 was the first to show , in an explicit way , how the dressing could be done in order to endow an electron with its own coulomb field .",
    "his aim was a quantization of qed that would involve only those degrees of freedom that actually contribute to the dynamic evolution of the system .",
    "in retrospective , it does not sound as a surprise that he gave up the manifest covariance properties of the physical fields under lorentz transformations : it was well known , after the gupta - bleuler formulation , that , even when restricting to the zero charge sector , such manifestly covariant formulations do involve indefinite metric , _",
    "i.e _ extra degrees of freedom irrelevant to the dynamic evolution .",
    "after dirac other authors have investigated different ways of dressing the basic fields , with different motivations and with different aims .",
    "the list given by @xmath25 only gives some references that are closer in spirit to the present article and , in any event , has no pretension to completeness .",
    "@xmath13 provides a much more comprehensive bibliography , whereas @xmath26 provides its updating .    on the same footing as dirac",
    ", covariance is given up also in the model investigations of steinmann @xmath27 , who has the same aim as dirac , and of ref .",
    "@xmath13 and other works by the same group , who instead think of the dressed fields as composite operators within the usual formulation of the gauge theory .",
    "the non - implementability of lorentz boosts in the charged sectors of qed is indeed , after the model independent investigations of @xmath4 , taken for granted to the point that , once the symmetry is broken by hand from the very beginning of the construction , no attempt is made to restore it . the only exception is provided , to our knowledge , by the attempts of one of the present authors and collaborators @xmath28 .",
    "needless to say , the effort of restoring lorentz symmetry at some stage in our construction of dressed fields will be made also in the present paper .",
    "we have to state clearly that situating our results about qed within the general framework of @xmath4 is a non trivial subject , particularly because our results only concern some two - point functions and admittedly are , for now , incomplete .",
    "it is true , on the other hand , that the results of the present and the following papers @xmath29 open the possibility of performing systematic model calculations that could help an explicit and exhaustive comparison : this is one of the several open , possibly not insurmountable , questions to be discussed in the conclusions .    among the references we have cited",
    ", the work by steinmann deserves a special mention , for not only it has been close in spirit to ours along the years , but it has been constantly inspiring .",
    "we feel it is not by chance that another part of steinmann s and collaborator s work , not immediately connected with the problems specific to gauge theories , is invaluable to the approach presented here .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the usual dyson expansion formula for the calculations of vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the type @xmath30 is not sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the composite fields we will introduce , will themselves be @xmath31-ordered formal power series .",
    "so the calculation of their correlation functions will demand the ability at computing  in perturbation theory ( pt )  both wightman functions and , more in general , multi - time - ordered vev s of the type @xmath32 .",
    "ref.s @xmath33 exactly provide the algorithm for doing all this .",
    "our attitude in the present paper is that we do not want to make any _ a priori _ assumption about ir asymptotic dynamics , with the exception of enforcing symmetries : local gauge , translations and lorentz in particular .",
    "ir asymptotic dynamics should , hopefully , emerge by itself , _",
    "i.e. _ only by our ability at calculating the near - mass - shell behaviour of correlation functions , once a particular gauge invariant charged field has been selected within the framework of step ( i ) above . in other words",
    "the main point is that ( i ) leaves a remarkable freedom and evidently any choice made in selecting the form of physical charged fields may , and indeed does , affect the outcomes of ( ii)-(iv ) .",
    "our work will , as a consequence , consist in exploiting all the freedom ( i ) leaves to see whether there exists a field with a near - mass - shell behaviour mild enough to enable one to eventually face point ( iii ) and ( iv ) . in the case",
    "the motivations about the necessity of having fields with a mild near - mass - shell behaviour should be recapitulated in more intuitive and physical terms , we have found the discussion given in @xmath34 particularly sound .",
    "our expectation is that , playing , as we will do , twice the same game , one should have different results in qed and qcd respectively .",
    "there is infact no point about the statement that the electron is not confined whereas , the quark should be so .",
    "now , while in qed it is more or less generally accepted that the non - confinement of the electron should result in the existence of some kind of asymptotic ( possibly not lsz ) limit , the way the confinement of quarks and gluons should show up is less generally agreed upon : we have already recalled some among the many , sometime conflicting , mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature : needless to say , we will come out with a mechanism different from all the others !",
    "so , in order to directly compare qed and qcd , we will construct `` dressed electron '' @xmath35 and `` quark '' @xmath36 fields ( we could also construct the `` gluon '' @xmath37 , but the investigation of its behaviour in higher orders is better postponed to future work , for a comparison with its qed analogue would be less stringent : the photon has no charge ) whose two - point functions up the fourth order in the coupling constant - the simplest place where a difference between qed and qcd may emerge - have the following properties :    \\(1 ) they are independent of the gauge - fixing parameter ;    \\(2 ) ultraviolet divergences brought about by the compositeness of the dressing are cured by a single renormalization constant introduced in the definition ;    \\(3 ) on - shell normalization conditions can be imposed , in the ir regularized theory , on the single ir divergent graphs with two different outcomes .    ( 3a ) in qed a complete cancellation of ir divergences takes place , and the two - point function is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wightman function of the free spinor field , whereas the higher order terms , described by the two invariant functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 are given , to the first order , by    @xmath43    and , to the second order ( whose full form is given in section [ sec6 ] ) have the near - mass - shell , asymptotic form @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "( 3b ) in qcd , assuming dimensional regularization for ir divergences @xmath46 _ i.e. _ @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 @xmath46 the latter do not cancel , but obey the factorization equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is defined by the amputation of the interacting part @xmath51 the first evident comment about the above results is that the game , played twice with the same rules , gives two qualitatively different results .",
    "it is sufficient , _ per se _ , to state that the ir asymptotic dynamics of the two models is different ( this was expected ) , even in perturbation theory ( possibly , this is a less widespread belief ) .    concerning @xmath52 , although the result is that the singularity of the free field theory is not altered by the radiative corrections that vanish on the mass - shell , it is true that the mass hyperboloid @xmath1 is not isolated as in the mass gap case .",
    "this result , expected on the basis of simple physical intuition , is in agreement with the observation made in ref .",
    "@xmath53 , where it has been pointed out that , in the case of gauge theories , the particle content might be recovered at the cost of abandoning wigner notion of an irreducible representation of poincar group sitting on an isolated mass hyperboloid .",
    "the investigation of this point pertains the step ( iii ) above .",
    "we will not pursue it in this article .",
    "concerning the second result @xmath54 , we find it intriguing for two reasons .",
    "the first is that it is simple - we mean the factorization .",
    "the second is the occurrence of the celebrated @xmath55 factor , _ with the plus sign_.    we can not therefore resist the temptation of commenting on the consequences @xmath54 would have , were it true in any order of pt . in the latter case",
    "its integration would yield @xmath56 with @xmath57 ir finite .",
    "this hints at a different scenario , in which the heisenberg `` quark '' field , _ as a result of ir asymptotic dynamics _ , is a free field not asymptotically , but at _ any _ momentum @xmath58",
    ".    it may be useful to recall the example of the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghost in qed : in that case the field is free by construction and there is a factorization of correlation functions involving the ghost into a bunch of free ghost two - point - functions times a connected correlation function only involving fields with zero ghost number .",
    "could one say that the ghost number is confined ?    in qcd ,",
    "even if @xmath59 were true , one could not immediately conclude , as in the case of local fields @xmath60 ( we remind that dressed fields do not share the locality property ) , that the @xmath61 is a free field . nonetheless a working hypothesis could be to check whether , as a consequence of ir asymptotic dynamics , the factorization of quark and gluon free two - point functions , out of connected correlation functions only involving colour singlets , does indeed take place .",
    "the existence of asymptotic limit would , in the latter case , be by far simpler then in qed  it would be trivial .    of course",
    ", it is not necessary for the above scenario to take really place that the function @xmath62 preserves , on possibly going from ( @xmath63 ) to an exact result , the specific form given by equation ( @xmath64 ) suggested by our fourth order calculation .",
    "it might dress up even as a full series in @xmath65 , provided that @xmath66 for @xmath67 carried on holding .",
    "we are aware that , on extrapolating our result @xmath54 to @xmath59 , we have raised more questions ( all orders , gluon , ir asymptotics of many - point - functions ) than we will answer in this article .",
    "but , in the framework we will set up , these questions do not seem to us prohibitively out of the range of traditional and well established tools of qft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the freedom one has in dressing the basic fields is analyzed in detail on the level of classical fields .",
    "section [ sec3 ] sets the stage for the calculation of quantum correlation functions : it is argued that an algorithm for computing vev with several time orderings , _",
    "i.e. _ of the type @xmath68 , is needed and the exhaustive work of ostendorff and steinmann @xmath33 , giving such an algorithm , is summarized .",
    "section [ sec4 ] systematically explores in pt the lowest order of the two - point functions relative to the fields constructed in section [ sec2 ] , and the full form of @xmath69 , equation ( @xmath70 ) , is established .",
    "section [ sec6 ] gives a concise outlook of the fourth order calculations : the full form of @xmath71 , equation ( @xmath72 ) , is given together with a description of the way we follow to calculate it and to obtain equation ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the full derivation of the latter results , as well as the proofs of their properties ( 1)-(3 ) above , are left for forthcoming papers . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we give a retrospective of the construction we have done and pinpoint the open problems that , in our opinion , most urgently should be faced in order to give the further , necessary support to such a construction .",
    "let @xmath73 denote a multiplet of dirac fields transforming as the fundamental representation @xmath74 of the colour group @xmath75 ( the extension to whatever compact semi - simple lie group being trivial ) .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath76 the yang - mills potentials .",

    "we claim that one can choose _ real _ kernel functions @xmath94 s such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 transform under @xmath97 according to @xmath98 before we proceed to enforce the transformation properties @xmath99 , two comments are in order about the multiple convolutions displayed in @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "this is quite welcome because we are aiming at constructing locally gauge invariant fields that carry nontrivial global colour numbers : indeed , concerning local gauge transformations , once @xmath99 are satisfied , the spinor fields : @xmath104 are obviously invariant under @xmath97 while they transform as @xmath74 and @xmath105 when @xmath106 is not chosen according to @xmath107 , but is constant with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "let us go back to enforcing @xmath99 .",
    "steinmann has faced this problem in ref .",
    "he assumes that , on introducing @xmath97 into @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the derivatives can be reversed by parts . while this can be justified for space derivatives , thanks to the boundary conditions @xmath107 on the ghost , the thing is less justifiable for the time derivatives , as one has no _ a priori _ control on asymptotic behaviour in time . in electrodynamics",
    "there is a way out : since the ghost is free , one can choose suitable solutions of the dalambert equation @xmath109 that justify the neglect of boundary terms . in the non - abelian case",
    "the problem is there : we shall , as in @xmath90 , just ignore it , recalling however the statement ( 1 ) of the introduction that , in the case of quantum fields , we will be able to prove the @xmath110-independence of correlation functions .",
    "let us first focus on @xmath117 .",
    "a family of solutions to this equation that also satisfies @xmath121 and @xmath122 isa @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a real parameter and @xmath125 is a 4-vector that we leave , for the moment , unspecified .",
    "two particular solutions from @xmath126 are @xmath127 it can be verified that the two following sets of functions @xmath128 and @xmath129 , given by @xmath130 separately satisfy all equations @xmath118-@xmath122 .",
    "these solutions also fulfil the factorization property @xmath131 well known as eikonal identity , as well as the @xmath132reflection exchange relation @xmath133    we will also need a third set of solutions , that extend to higher orders the lowest order solution obtained by setting @xmath134 in @xmath126 : @xmath135 with principal value prescription ( pv ) for the @xmath136 denominator .",

    "this also is the point where we can explain how we will recover the lost lorentz symmetry .",

    "but this is not the end of the story .",
    "if , according to a well known argument , the near - mass - shell behaviour of the field is driven by the classical currents responsible for the interaction with soft gluons / photons , we can make a guess about it by operating the replacement @xmath225 within the integration in the r.h.s . of @xmath226 .",
    "it is then seen that , thanks now to the first of equations @xmath205 with @xmath227 , also the classical currents decouple and no longer drive the asymptotic ir dynamics of @xmath228 . as a result , the near - mass - shell behaviour of the field @xmath228 we have defined should be at least milder than that of both the gauge - variant @xmath86 and the @xmath157-dependent @xmath198 .",

    "so in principle there are five inequivalent partitions .    the two partitions in which @xmath412 is non - integer have three on - shell lines joining in the same vertex , so their contribution is zero .",
    "there remain the three sector partition labelled by @xmath414 .    the first ",
    "@xmath415  is again ( bl ) in fig .",
    "@xmath327 , so its contribution is easily recovered from @xmath378 and @xmath367 , provided the integral @xmath416 is taken , according to @xmath291 and @xmath142 , with the @xmath417 prescription .",
    "in fact , in this case the denominator @xmath418 is no longer positive on the two - body phase - space . the result is still given by @xmath419 .",
    "it is now convenient to consider the sector partitions of graph c in fig .",
    "@xmath310 , postponing to later the sector partitions of fig .",
    "@xmath411 labelled by @xmath412 = 2 , 3 .",
    "the sector numbers can only be assigned as in fig . @xmath420 .",
    "therefore this is again partition ( c ) of fig .",
    "@xmath323 , easily recovered from @xmath378 and @xmath367 , provided that in the integral @xmath421 the @xmath418 denominator is pv prescribed . again",
    "the result is provided by @xmath422 .    finally , the only sector partition of the one string reducible graph tl in fig .",
    "@xmath310 ( sector numbers 1 to 4 clockwise from right vertex ) is again disposed of , thanks to @xmath423 instruction in @xmath291 .",
    "going back to the other two sector partitions @xmath424 of fig .",
    "@xmath411 , they both have a @xmath341 factor ( the fermion line in the right ) and so take the place of ( @xmath328l ) of the previous section .",
    "the contribution of these partitions is parameterized , in analogy with @xmath355 , by @xmath425\\,w_0(p ) \\label{zl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , the invariant functions @xmath124 and @xmath426 depend on @xmath214 and @xmath58 through the variable @xmath427 ( defined in @xmath428 and now , with @xmath429 , satisfying @xmath430 ) and on the cutoffs @xmath431 , @xmath432 : the result of the calculation gives @xmath433 in which , we remind , @xmath434 is given by @xmath387 and @xmath435                                         + [ \\beta \\to -\\beta ]      \\quad .\\label{upsilon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    comparison of the above formulae with the corresponding @xmath353 , @xmath436 shows that  contrary to @xmath351  the invariant function @xmath426 does depend on uv : this means that no choice of the renormalization constant @xmath238 introduced in @xmath246 ( and giving rise to counterterms proportional to @xmath341 , not to @xmath437 ) can cure the divergence . in addition",
    "there also are the coefficients of uv and ir in @xmath124 that both depend on @xmath58 through @xmath438 . as for the ir divergence associated with a space - like string , the result is not new @xmath27 .",
    "there is a way out of this problem : choosing @xmath439 in the rest frame , in which only @xmath440 . in this case in fact @xmath441last line of ( @xmath442)@xmath443 , so that a suitable choice of @xmath238 to order @xmath294 removes the divergence .",
    "unfortunately , the choice @xmath439 spoils lorentz invariance and we will not stick to it .    to summarize : the perturbative theory involving a charged field , dressed with a string in space - like direction , is non - renormalizable  at least at finite orders  due to the @xmath214-string . there survive , in addition , ir divergences carried by both the @xmath214- and the @xmath157-string .      the discussion of local graphs as well as of the sector partitions with only one string vertex ( fig .",
    "@xmath322 ; fig . @xmath411 and its analogue giving rise to a partition ( br ) and to a contribution obtained by ( @xmath445 ) , with a replacement analogue to ( @xmath446 ) ) presents no novelty with respect to the preceding subsection .",
    "the only novel feature is given by graph c of fig .",
    "@xmath310 , where the only partition is given by assigning sector numbers from 1 to 4 with clockwise movement , starting from the top right vertex .",
    "this is again recovered from @xmath378 and @xmath367 , provided the integral @xmath421 is now taken with both @xmath214 and @xmath157 space - like , _",
    "i.e _ with both denominators prescribed by pv .",
    "the result is once more @xmath422 .    in this case also , thanks to the and contributions , there are uv as well ir divergences due to each string .",
    "choosing both @xmath447 in the rest frame would eliminate the two problems .",
    "however , once more we refrain from breaking lorentz symmetry , also because there is another way out of this empasse .",
    "this is provided exactly by the double limit @xmath448 .",
    "the latter has to be effected first by dragging @xmath58 in @xmath312 : this makes the whole two - point function vanish , due to the support of the @xmath449 in the and contributions , and to the support of the @xmath380 two - body phase - space in all the other ones . at this point",
    "taking the limit is safe and gives zero , in agreement with the naive extrapolation of @xmath400 discussed in the end of subsection [ sec4a ] .",
    "the calculations of section [ sec4 ] should make it evident that the only two - point function free from both uv and ir problems is that relative to the field ( @xmath450 ) : they provide evidence for the necessity , rather than the possibility , of taking the limit @xmath451 , whose meaning and implications we have discussed in the final part of section [ sec2 ] .",
    "it is also clear that , in order to obtain the result ( @xmath452 ) , commuting the limit @xmath451 with the loop integration makes the calculation by far simpler and that , consistently , only the diagrammatic rules of subsection [ sec4a ] have to be used in order to get a non - vanishing two - point function .",
    "exactly in this way , we have performed the two - loop calculation of @xmath71 , equation ( @xmath453 ) , in qed .",
    "this receives contribution from 12 graphs for a total of 19 non - vanishing partitions , 10 of which involve two - body phase - space , the other 9 involve three - body phase - space .",
    "the graphs with only one external fermion line on shell  as the partitions ( @xmath328l ) or ( @xmath328r ) of section [ sec4a ]  have not been included in the counting , because , much as in the case of ( @xmath454 ) , they can be renormalized away with a suitable choice of the fourth order contribution @xmath455 to the renormalization constant @xmath456 .",
    "several graphs exhibit an ir divergences proportional to @xmath457 . in this qed calculation , the photon mass regularization has been adopted , for it is well known not to interfere with either brst symmetry or unitarity .",
    "indeed , we have a diagrammatic ( _ i.e. _ without the need of analytic calculations ) proof of the decoupling of unphysical degrees of freedom , in the form of gauge - fixing parameter independence : @xmath458    furthermore , we have found that the grammer - yennie @xmath459 method of control of ir divergences can be extended , in a straightforward way , to the graphs that include the eikonal string vertices .",
    "this results in a diagrammatic proof ( analogue to that of @xmath460 ) of a complete cancellation between the ir divergences coming from the three - body cut graphs and the two - body cut graphs .",
    "what is left is the explicit result of the calculation that we report below to give concreteness to what we have said , although in its full form it is not illuminating . for @xmath461 ( _ i.e. _ omitting graphs involving closed fermion loops , that are irrelevant for the near - mass - shell asymptotics ) the two structure functions , defined by ( @xmath399 ) with @xmath462 , are given by @xmath463 whose asymptotic form for @xmath464 is equation ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "it should be also noted that in the ultraviolet regime @xmath465 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath466 , @xmath467 and @xmath468 vanish respectively as @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",
    "so , when dispersed in @xmath471 , they need no subtraction .    concerning the qcd counterpart of the above calculation , stated in equation ( @xmath63 ) of section [ intro ] , apart from the contribution of the non - planar qed graphs ( those where the colour matrices occur in the sequence @xmath472 ) , there are 15 more graphs giving rise to 23 partitions , 8 of them involving two - body phase - space , the other 15 the three - body phase - space .",
    "a due remark concerns the ir regularization : giving a mass to the gluon , even according to @xmath473 , preserves brst symmetry , but only formally preserves unitarity in the limit @xmath474 . as a matter of fact",
    "we have verified that , in this limit , the r.h.s . of ( @xmath475 )",
    "does not vanish .",
    "we have therefore abandoned this regularization adopting dimensional regularization for the ir @xmath48 and changed dimensional regularization for the uv with non - lagrangian pauli - villars @xmath303 . with these regularizations ,",
    "equation ( @xmath475 ) indeed holds also in the nonabelian case .    in writing equation ( @xmath63 )",
    ", we have recalculated the abelian part ( proportional to @xmath476 ) with the new ir and uv regularizations , with the expected result that the cancellation of ir divergences holds also in the new scheme .",
    "these details , however , will be part of a forthcoming paper giving the details of the above described two - loop calculation @xmath29 .",
    "concerning instead the non - abelian part , we can say , referring to the factor @xmath477 appearing in ( @xmath63 ) , that @xmath478 comes from the sum of all the graphs that include gluon self - energy corrections ; a further 1 comes from the @xmath479 part of the non - planar abelian graphs . for the other graphs ( whose sector partitions are , in some cases , ir divergent even as @xmath480 , not just as @xmath481 ) there is a complete cancellation between the two - body cut and the three - body cut contributions to each of them .",
    "we have shown how to construct brst invariant composite fermion fields that carry the global quantum numbers of the electron and of the quark in qed and qcd .",
    "the construction consists in dressing the ordinary dirac field with a rectilinear string whose space - time direction is characterized by a 4-vector that , provisionally , breaks the lorentz covariance properties of the field . in perturbation theory",
    "the string generates new graphs characterized by the occurrence of eikonal vertices .",
    "these new vertices require prescriptions ( either @xmath482 or pv ) whose choice is uniquely dictated by the dirac conjugation properties of the field . furthermore ,",
    "after going in momentum representation , the 4-vector characterizing the string must be chosen proportional to the 4-momentum of the field .",
    "this choice : ( i ) restores lorentz , ( ii ) averts some ir as well as some nonrenormalizable uv divergences .",
    "the second point indicates that , as a matter of fact , there is little choice .",
    "if these fields are to survive further and more stringent verifications , one can conclude that global charges associated to a gauss law imply , for the fields carrying such charges , delocalization properties considerably more involved than the single 1-dimensional string in 3-space , somewhat popular in the literature : since the string is rectilinear in 4-momentum space , in coordinate representation the fields rather appear spread out all over minkowski space , exhibiting a kind of candy - sugar structure .",
    "the construction gives  as an extra bonus  different results for the ir asymptotic dynamics of qed and qcd respectively .",
    "in particular , it hints at a mechanism of confinement according to which the quark so constructed seems to behave as a free field at any momentum scale .",
    "the construction presented raises several problems ; but the algorithm we have given in this paper also provides the possibility to face them . among others ,",
    "a few of them still involve two - point functions :    * extending to any order in pt the above results about : ( i ) ir cancellation in qed and ( ii ) ir non - cancellation and factorization in qcd . *",
    "the verification that any gauge invariant coloured field , first of all the gluon , has the same behaviour as the quark .      * the verification that such fields do indeed carry the expected global charges , _",
    "e.g. _ that they satisfy in pt at least the weak commutation relations @xmath483\\ , \\rangle =         \\langle \\ ,   e(x)\\ , \\overline e(y ) \\,\\rangle ~,\\ ] ] _ etc .",
    "_ , where @xmath484 is the electric charge ( and the analogue in qcd ) .",
    "* a study of the vev of the algebra of lorentz generators ( the boosts in particular ) , in order to represent , in explicit way , the mechanism that prevents a unitary implementation of lorentz symmetry in the charged superselection sector generated by @xmath35  or , in alternative , to show how this mechanism is evaded by the fields we have proposed .",
    "* a comparison of the present approach with the well established results of qed such as those about inclusive cross section or the electron @xmath485 and , in general , the impact of this construction  if any  on the @xmath16 matrix . * for qcd , the proof of the scenario we have hinted at in section [ intro ] , namely that amplitudes involving gauge invariant coloured fields either vanish or disconnect into the product of free two - point functions relative to coloured fields times an amplitude that only involves colour singlet fields .",
