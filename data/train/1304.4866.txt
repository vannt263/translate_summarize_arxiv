    "as the nearest active site of massive star formation , the orion nebula ( messier 42 , ngc1976 ) and its associated young stellar cluster  the orion nebula cluster ( onc )  provide a unique opportunity for studying the star formation process at the present epoch in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "young ( a few myr old ) , relatively massive ( @xmath0m@xmath1 ) stellar clusters like the onc contain , besides a large number of low mass objects ( @xmath2m@xmath1 , @xcite ) , also ob stars .",
    "these massive , early type stars disrupt the placental molecular cloud and affect the evolution of the multitude of surrounding low mass stars through their strong ionizing radiation , line - driven winds , and induced photoevaporative flows .",
    "mass ejection from low mass cluster members , close dynamical encounters and substantial and variable x - ray emission also contribute to create a harsh environment which may critically affect planet formation @xcite .",
    "images of photo - evaporating circumstellar disks taken with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the canonical scenario for star formation , valid for isolated low - mass stars ( m @xmath3  m@xmath1 ) quietly forming in sparse , low mass clusters ( t associations ) , may not adequately account for typical star formation in rich clusters @xcite .",
    "as the sun appears to have formed in a similar environment @xcite , understanding the onc may shed light not only on key passages of the star and planet formation in general , but also on the origin of our own planetary system @xcite .",
    "due to its location and structure @xcite , the onc can be studied in great detail .",
    "it is close ( @xmath4  pc , @xcite ) , at relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath5 , corresponding to 135  pc from the galactic plane ) , and in an anti - center quadrant ( @xmath6 ) with minimal foreground confusion .",
    "the large extinction of omc-1 , ( up to @xmath7 ) on the main ridge eliminates background confusion down to almost the h - burning limit @xcite .",
    "the moderate extinction ( @xmath8 ) caused by a foreground veil of neutral gas encompassing the nearest members of the onc @xcite allows detailed studies at visible wavelengths of individual stars .",
    "the young stellar population of the onc has been studied for decades .",
    "one of the most outstanding works to characterize the individual properties of these pre - main sequance ( pms ) members is that of @xcite . in particular",
    ", she assembled a large photometric and spectroscopic database at visible wavelengths down to @xmath9  mag . by estimating the stellar extinction for more than 1000 individual sources down to @xmath10  m@xmath1",
    ", she derived absolute luminosities , ages and masses .",
    "more recently @xcite the census of pms stars in orion has been extended and the stellar parameters derived for each source ( e.g. , effective temperature @xmath11 ; luminosity @xmath12 ) further refined .",
    "the isochronal age of the onc is about 1 - 2  myr , with evidence for a spread in ages @xcite , although its actual extent in time is still debated @xcite . in what concerns the mass distribution",
    ", it peaks at about @xmath13  m@xmath1 , but the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is highly dependent on the assumed evolutionary models @xcite .    over the last decade",
    "several near infrared surveys , both in imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have probed the imf well into the brown dwarf regime down to the planetary mass range .",
    "the combination of photometry and spectroscopy is obviously a most powerful tool , allowing one to estimate the stellar parameters for individual sources ; however , the spectroscopic surveys in the onc have been limited either to the central part of the region , or to a sparse sampling of the entire cluster .    despite the large amount of data collected over the years in the onc ,",
    "the accurate estimate of the properties of its population remains challenging .",
    "fluxes of pms stars are generally contaminated by uv and optical flux excesses due to accretion processes @xcite as well as by the near infrared @xcite emission from circumstellar disks .",
    "also , the differential extinction of the different sources partially embedded in the parental cloud , limits a precise estimate of their properties , due to the strong degeneracy between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite ; this is mitigated by having at disposal multiple observed colors .",
    "moreover , young stars show evident photometric variability @xcite , which also introduces further uncertainties . for what concerns the substellar young members in orion",
    ", their faint luminosity generally limits their optical observational investigation to those least affected by dust extinction . finally , the non - uniformity of the nebular background , both at large scales and in the local stellar vicinity ( due to the possible presence of circumstellar material , either dusty disks or photoevaporating ones ) requires imaging with high angular resolution , not achievable using ground - based facilities .",
    "it is clear that under these circumstances , a panchromatic survey of the onc with the high sensitivity and angular resolution of _ hst _  guarantees an unprecedented , outstanding data set which enables to overcome these problems and attack the open questions about this star forming region . specifically , the main aspects to understand in depth include : 1 ) what is the shape of the imf , down to the lowest substellar masses in orion ? does it differ from other star forming regions , and from the galaxy field ?",
    "2 ) what is the age of the system , and what have the time scales of its formation been ? 3 ) how does mass accretion take place ?",
    "how does it depend on the properties of the central objects ?",
    "4 ) what are the properties of the circumstellar disks , and to what extent are they affected by the harsh environment of the orion nebula ?",
    "can they form planets ?",
    "5 ) what are the properties of multiple stellar system in orion , and their circumstellar disks ?    the particular abilities of _ hst _  to investigate the onc were soon recognized in the early years of the mission , when @xcite performed a photometric survey of the trapezium region @xcite , the inner 0.3  pc ( 3.5  arcmin ) of the onc .",
    "unfortunately , the photometry derived from these data , taken in 1991 with the spherically aberrated wfpc1 , is subject to uncertainties as large as 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "several observing programs have been executed since then with all instruments onboard _ hst _ , mostly dedicated to high resolution imaging in narrow - band filters of the central region to study the photoionized and dark silhouette disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a wide area survey ( _ hst _  program go-9825 , p.i .",
    "j.  bally ) has also covered a large part of the orion nebula in the h@xmath16 filter of acs .",
    "the _ hst _  treasury program on the onc , described in this paper , has been intended to perform the definitive study of the stellar component of the onc at visible wavelengths .",
    "the program , awarded with a total of 104 orbits ( cycle 13 , go program 10246 , p.i .",
    "m. robberto ) , has covered the brightest regions of the great orion nebula at optical wavelengths , using broad band filters to obtain the most accurate photometry of the largest possible number of pre - main - sequence objects .",
    "all imagers onboard the _ hst _  have been used , namely the _ advanced camera for surveys _ in its wide field channel mode ( acs / wfc ) the _ wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) _ and the _ near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) _ in camera 3 mode .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "observations have been complemented by a ground - based campaign with obtained nearly _ simultaneous _ photometry of the cluster from the u - band to the k - band @xcite .",
    "given the complexity of the observations , the nonconventional use of the _ hst _  and the large amount of data ( more than 2,000 single exposures ) that were obtained , we provide in this paper a description of the program and a guide to the main data products . in section  [ section : observations ] we describe the observations ; in section  [ section : datareduction ] the reduction and processing of the imaging data ; section  [ section : photometry ] presents the details of photometry performed for each instrument . in section  [ section : dataproducts ]",
    "we summarize the data products we are publicly releasing , consisting of photometric catalogs and atlases and mosaiced images .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : results ] we outline the main results that have been presented so far based on the _ hst _  orion treasury program . also , as an appendix , we present in detail the realization of the spectacular color rendering of the region based on our acs observations .",
    "the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) camera is based on a mosaic of two @xmath17-pixel ccd detectors .",
    "the instrument optics deliver a spatial scale of @xmath18  mas / pixel , corresponding to a nominal field of view of @xmath19 .",
    "the two detectors are butted together on the long side with a interchip gap of approximately 50 pixels ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the readout noise is @xmath21  e pixel@xmath22 and the average dark current rate is @xmath23  e s@xmath22pixel@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we used the non - standard electronic gain of 2  e / adu in order to keep the detector saturation level , around 84,700 e@xmath24 , within the range of the 16-bit analog - to - digital converters .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the ccds of acs remain almost perfectly linear ( @xmath25 discrepancy between relative count levels ) up to saturation , and saturated charges spreading in the bleeding trails are fully preserved , allowing to recover the photometry of saturated sources with very high precision .",
    "the off - axis optics of acs introduce a skew image distortion between 7% and 10% of the field size .",
    "since the pixels are projected as skew trapezoids on the sky , the fraction of sky area they actually map changes across the detector .",
    "this introduces a photometric error which can be corrected , as explained in section  [ section : photometry : acs ] .",
    "the wfpc2 camera , now replaced by the wide field camera-3 , used four @xmath26-pixel ccds .",
    "three of them image a @xmath27 chevron - shaped region ( wf , wide field ) with a spatial sampling of 100  mas / pixel , the fourth one ( pc , planetary camera ) images a smaller @xmath28 square field with 46  mas / pixel nested at the center of the chevron , in the fourth quadrant . following the wfpc2 instrument handbook @xcite ,",
    "the nominal readout noise is 7.02 , 7.84 , 6.99 and 8.32 electrons for the channels wf1 to wf4 . the mean dark current rate ( @xmath29  e@xmath24s@xmath22pixel@xmath22 ) is comparable to the one of acs .",
    "our observations were made when the wfpc2 instrument had already accumulated about 11 years of total radiation dose in a space environment , and was therefore affected by significant charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses .",
    "the brightness of the orion nebula background , especially in broad band filters and at the center of the region , mitigates this problem .",
    "we applied the prescribed photometric correction @xcite to our results ( see section  [ section : results ] ) , but still cte losses represent the major source of noise and photometric uncertainty of the wfpc2 data .",
    "concerning the gain setting , wfpc2 is equipped with 12 bit analog - to - digital converters .",
    "their 4096 adus of dynamic range does not sample the full dynamic range of the ccd detector even with the highest selectable gain of 14 e / adu , which we have used .",
    "the photometric information of saturated ( peak flux higher than about 53,000 electrons ) stars in wfpc2 images is therefore irremediably lost .",
    "the nicmos instruments has three cameras , all equipped with a @xmath30 hgcdte detector but with different pixel scale .",
    "we selected camera 3 ( nic3 ) because of its largest field of view , @xmath31 with 200  mas / pixel , aiming to maximize the survey efficiency .",
    "nic3 operates slightly out of focus with a loss in encircled energy beyond one pixel radius less than @xmath32 .",
    "this small degradation of the image quality partially compensates for the original undersampling of the nic3 psf .",
    "the equivalent readout noise of nicmos depends on the adopted sampling scheme and on the number of reads .",
    "we used the sampling sequence step64 with nsamp=12 for the f110w filter and nsamp=11  for the f160w filter , providing 255  s and 192  s integration time , respectively . with these parameters",
    "the readout noise is close to the nominal value of the instrument , around 27 electrons .",
    "we used the standard gain of 6.5 e / adu .",
    "our main scientific goals required a mosaic of the largest possible field in orion with both acs and wfpc2 in a number of broad - band filters .",
    "the strategy we implemented exploited the relative position and orientation of the acs / wfc and wfpc2 fields of view .",
    "we noticed that the combination of size , offset and position angle of the fields imaged by two instruments implies that the pointing move needed to image the same field seen by one of the two acs ccds with the other ccd causes the chevron pattern of wfpc2 to translate along its symmetry axis almost exactly by 1 acs / wf chip ( see figure  [ fig : scanmode ] ) . therefore , an acs strip obtained by repeatedly offsetting the telescope by half of the acs field - of - view produces a parallel , seamless herringbone pattern with wfpc2 . a second scan , adjacent to the first one ,",
    "can then be performed maintaining full - field coverage with wfpc2 at the price of a relatively modest ( approximately @xmath33 ) overlap of the larger acs / wfpc2 fields . by performing a third strip with the telescope rotated by @xmath34 ,",
    "the relative positions of acs / wfc and wfpc2 are exchanged .",
    "this third passage nicely complements the first two , providing contiguous area coverage of nearly the same field with both instruments .",
    "we have repeated the 2 + 1 strip pattern 3 times , adjusting the length of each strip to cover the largest area of bright nebular background , where _ hst _",
    "provides the greatest gain with respect to ground - based observations .",
    "the nine strips , numbered from 0 to 8 , are oriented nearly in the east - west direction with position angles 100@xmath35 or 280@xmath35 .",
    "the full fields covered by the acs / wfc and wfpc2 surveys are shown , respectively , in figures [ fig : acsfield ] and [ fig : wfpc2field ] . both are approximately centered at @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( j2000.0 ) , approximately @xmath38 to the sw of the trapezium asterism and extend over about @xmath39 of a square degree .",
    "in particular , the full acs mosaic covers 627 square arcminutes ( corresponding to about 904  mega pixel ) , whereas the wfpc2 mosaic covers 570.5 square arcminutes ( corresponding to 205.4 mpix , assuming the 100  mas / pixel scale of the wfpc2 wide field channels ) .",
    "this scanning pattern typically provides , for each filter , two images with acs with a few exceptions : 1 ) the half - fields at the extremes of each strip , covered by only one ccd , are observed once ; 2 ) the overlay regions between adjacent strips are typically observed 4 times ; 3 ) a small fraction of the acs field is observed 1 or 3 times , in correspondence of the detector gaps , or in the case of a visit repeated with a different orientation ( see section  [ section : observations : lostdata ] ) .",
    "further , smaller deviations are also occasionally present . for wfpc2",
    ", we typically have one passage per filter , except for the f336w band where the observations were split in two equal - length exposures ( see section  [ section : observations : filters ] ) . the areas observed with the wfpc2/pc",
    "have been generally observed also with the median detector ( nr .",
    "2 )  of the wfpc2/wf channel , with the exception of the very last field of each strip .    with nicmos ,",
    "our survey covered only a fraction of the acs field due to the limited field of view of the instrument ( figure  [ fig : actualnicmos ] ) .",
    "however , we created a strategy to perform some field dithering and increase the area covered without moving the telescope during the visits .",
    "the nicmos instrument is equipped with a field offset mirror ( fom ) which allows selecting the portion of the telescope focal plane falling on the detector . moving the fom ,",
    "it is possible to probe a field larger than the nominal @xmath40 of nic3 .",
    "the default fom position had been optimized in the early days of instrument commissioning and before our program fom moves had never been supported for science programs , for a number of good reasons : the image quality degrades at large distances from the optimal position , some vignetting is introduced at one fom extreme of the offset range , and the moving mechanisms does not allow repositioning the fom to better that 1 or 2 nic3 pixels .",
    "still , we were able to move the fom , building for each visit a 4 piece mosaic in the f160w band and a 5 piece mosaic in the f110w band .",
    "our request was granted on a shared risk basis , as the necessary changes to the nicmos  control software would have been tested `` on - the - fly '' using our observing time .",
    "our first nicmos observations , in fact , suffered from a number of fom  software limit errors . when this occurred , the fom returned to its nominal central position and the following nicmos observations within the same visit were suspended .",
    "this problem reoccurred for each visits scheduled using the same pattern .",
    "after each failure , the nicmos operation team immediately investigated the cause of the error implementing the needed changes .",
    "soon we were able to move the fom anywhere within the limits presented in table  [ tab : fom ] , where we also include for reference the values for nic1 and nic2 .",
    "the improvements made with the scheduling of the nicmos observations are illustrated in figure  [ fig : nicmosfields ] by the uneven shape of the fields covered with nic3 across the field , the size of each tile being generally proportional to the `` maturity '' of the fom  control software .",
    "a total of 102 regions were covered in both the filter  f110w and filter  f160w bands , corresponding to about 177 square arcminutes ( 15.9 mpix )  and 171.5 square arcminutes ( 15.4 mpix ) in the f110w  and f160w  filters , respectively",

    "the first epoch , executed in the fall of 2004 ( october 11 , 2004 - november 7 , 2004 ) , covered strips 2 , 5 and 6 with a position angle of @xmath41 , for a total of 36 orbits .",
    "the second epoch , executed in the spring of 2005 ( march 3 , 2005 - april 26 , 2005 ) covered strips 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 and 8 with a position angle of @xmath42 , for a total of 68 orbits .",

    "the broad - band acs filters , f435w , f555w , f775w and f850lp have been adopted for the main broad - band photometric survey .",
    "we estimated that all onc members down to below the substellar masses , with the exception of the brightest stars whose bleeding trail could fall out of the detector edges , would have provided enough signal in at least two acs  bands to allow constraining their stellar colors and therefore , given their spectral types , their reddening and absolute luminosity .",
    "the acs f658n @xmath47 filter is intended for mapping circumstellar matter with the highest possible resolution , mostly to discriminate extended sources and assess the presence of circumstellar emission or dark silhouette disks .",
    "the wfpc2 f336w filter was intended to probe the accretion luminosity and therefore the mass accretion rates on the onc stars , along the lines of the earlier work by @xcite . since this filter",
    "is affected by red leak , we have added a short exposure in the f814w filter to simultaneously probe the spectral region of the red leak and get a measure of the contamination unaffected by stellar variability .",
    "the f439w filter of wfpc2 also allows for a solid measure of the balmer jump . finally , the wfpc2 f656n filter is a narrow band @xmath47 filter which does not pass the [ nii ] line and has therefore stronger diagnostic power than the broader acs f658n filter , contaminated by the [ nii ] line at @xmath48   . for nicmos ,",
    "the f110w and f160w filters on nic3 were adopted to provide the deepest images of the fields ever obtained in the near - ir .    due to fom dithering pattern ,",
    "the integration times of the combined nicmos exposures varies across the mosaics , ranging between 192762 seconds in filter  f160w and 2561280 seconds in filter  f110w , the central parts of each sub - mosaic being imaged for the full amount of time . about 55% of the mosaics",
    "are covered for 192 seconds in the f160w band , and 40% for 380 seconds .",
    "for the f110w filter , around 45% is covered for 256 seconds , and 40% for 512 seconds .",
    "our observing strategy , optimized to map the largest possible field with all instruments onboard _ hst _  is less than ideal in what concerns the removal of cosmetic defects , cosmic rays in particular .",
    "we have therefore adopted the following strategy : for acs , where we have typically two ( and occasionally more ) images , cosmic rays were removed by adopting the value found in the other image(s ) , when available ( see section  [ section : datareduction : acsdrizzling ] ) .",
    "the same strategy has been adopted for the f336w images of wfpc2 , which come in pairs without dithering moves . for the other filters , taken as single images",
    ", we used the idl routine ` la_cosmic.pro ` written by joshua bloom ( caltech ) based on the laplacian algorithm originally developed by @xcite .",
    "finally , nicmos image have been taken in multiaccum mode sampling the integration signal as it accumulates on the detector .",
    "this allowed us to eliminate cosmic ray events using the standard nicmos pipeline .",
    "the brightness and stellar density at the core of the orion nebula reduces the number and reliability of useful guide stars .",
    "spurious sources ( extended , binaries ) cause loss of guide on the fine guide sensors of the telescope . in most cases ,",
    "the problems we encountered during the observations were minor . in a number of visits , only one guide star ( instead of the 2 usually required ) was available and the orientation of the telescope had to be maintained by the less accurate gyroscopes .",
    "this , together with the catalog errors in the absolute position of the guide stars , causes the images to be slightly misaligned with respect to their nominal position .",
    "on the other hand , due to the relatively short exposure times we generally adopted , it did not result in a significant degradation of the point spread function . only in a few occasions we encountered major anomalies :    1 .",

    "_ t _  refers to a data - transmission code from the _ hst _  spacecraft . in our case",

    "t = m _ ( merged )  for acs and nicmos , whereas it is _",
    "t = q _ ( retransmitted )  for wfpc2 .",
    "each of the @xmath50 acs exposures was run through the acs on - the - fly reprocessing ( otfr ) pipeline , which delivers @xmath51 pixel images corrected for bias , dark current and flat - field .",
    "otfr corrected images take the flt suffix ( @xmath49_flt.fits ) .",
    "the @xmath49_flt.fits   images are still affected by the geometric distortion introduced by the acs optics , mostly an 8% compression of the ratio of the diagonals . as a result ,",
    "wfc pixels project on the sky as rhombuses rather than squares .",
    "varying nonlinearly with field position , geometric distortion introduces a photometric error by up to 9% , depending on the sky area imaged by each pixel .",
    "geometric distortion , and the associated photometric error , can be corrected using e.g. the drizzle package , discussed in section  [ section : datareduction : acsdrizzling ] . however , when only a few dithered images are available ( as in our case ) , it is more appropriate to extract the source photometry from the geometrically distorted @xmath49_flt.fits  images , correcting only for the photometric error by multiplying the @xmath49_flt.fits  images by the pixel area map correction ( pam * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of acs / wfc",
    ", the pam represents the fraction of nominal sky area ( @xmath52 )  seen by each pixel . by avoiding re - sampling the images into a different projection",
    ", this approach preserves the original sharpness of both real stellar images and artifacts like bleeding trails and cosmic rays . working on individual images rather than",
    "mosaiced images can also yield better photometry is some cases .",
    "for example , stars that are significantly variable can be mistakenly identified as being affected by cosmic rays in the mosaicing process , resulting in pixels near the psf core being corrupted in the mosaic .",
    "sticking with the individual images for the photometry avoids this problem .",
    "our acs photometry has therefore been obtained on pam  corrected @xmath49_flt.fits   images ( see section  [ section : photometry ] ) .",
    "the two ccds of acs , thinned and backside illuminated , may be affected by fringing longward of 7500 due to the interference between the incident light and the light internally reflected at the interface between the thin layers of the chip .",
    "this problem affects our f850lp acs  images . on the ground , fringing is usually due to atmospheric airglow lines . in our case , it is due to the nebular emission of the orion nebula , dominated in the f850lp pass - band by the [ s iii ] lines at 9069 and 9532 , in a ratio of approximately 1:3 @xcite .",
    "the pa7 line at 10049 is a lesser contributor whereas the hei 10830 , intrinsically about as strong as the stronger 9069  [ siii ] line , is damped by the low quantum efficiency of ccds at this wavelength and contributes negligibly in comparison to the other lines .",
    "the fringing pattern produced by an extended source like the orion nebula varies across the field following the relative brightness distribution of the emission lines .",
    "this complicates its suppression through image processing .",
    "to mitigate fringing , we created a fringe flat - field by filtering out both low and high spatial frequencies from our f850lp images .",
    "then we combined the fringe flat with that obtained from the acs fringe optical model for the [ s iii ] 9069 and 9532 lines of @xcite .",
    "this reduced the peak - to - peak amplitude of the fringe pattern from @xmath53 to less than @xmath54 , making our f850lp @xmath49_flt.fits  images largely unaffected by fringing .      to remove cosmic rays and combine the images into a single mosaic aligned with a global astrometric reference frame we use the multidrizzle software @xcite .",
    "multidrizzle takes as input the @xmath49_flt.fits  images and returns them as @xmath49_drz.fits   _ drizzled _ images corrected for distortion , aligned on the common astrometric grid and cosmic - ray cleaned .",
    "then it combines the @xmath49_drz.fits   images into a single image , which usually represents the final _ hst _   data product with optimal depth , cosmetic quality and improved sampling of the psf .    for a survey area as large as the one imaged by our program",
    ", the alignment of the distortion corrected @xmath49_drz.fits  images into a single astrometric frame is generally rather complex .",
    "the astrometric information originally stored in the original fits  image header , calculated on the basis of the nominal parameters of the instrument and telescope pointing , is not accurate enough .",
    "this because the absolute position of the _ hst _  guide stars is typically known with an uncertainty of about @xmath55 , i.e. 10 - 20 acs / wfc pixels .",
    "guide star position errors affect not only the relative offset between the drizzled acs images , but also induce a rotation error : as the observations are generally performed locking the fine guide sensors ( fgss ) on two different guide stars typically separated by about @xmath56 , there is an orientation error as large as @xmath57 in position angle , of the order of one pixel at the edge of the acs field . in general , therefore , the astrometric correction stored in the fits header as world coordinate system ( wcs ) parameters must be corrected before drizzling .    in the case of our acs mosaic",
    ", the large shifts between images and the relatively low number of point - like sources made the alignment procedure especially challenging .",
    "our final strategy has been based on the following steps :    1 .",
    "first , a copy of the f850lp and f775w @xmath49_flt.fits  images was smoothed with a gaussian filter and subtracted from the original ones to remove most of the non uniform background ; sextractor @xcite was then run to derive the position of the sources ; the coordinates of unsaturated source in at least one of the two filters were matched and merged to reduce the possibility of contamination by clusters of cosmic rays .",
    "this resulted in an initial input catalog of sources ; 2 .",
    "we concentrated on the @xmath58 images , as this filter yields the largest number of usable sources .",
    "the @xmath59 positions of all unsaturated point sources in the f850w @xmath49_flt.fits  images were accurately measured using the iraf 2-d gaussian centering routine .",
    "the measured @xmath59 positions were corrected for geometric distortion using the @xcite distortion model , known to be accurate to better than @xmath60 pixels , i.e. less than 5  mas , across the extent of the acs / wfc @xmath49_flt.fits  images .",
    "4 .   for each of the nine acs strips , the distortion corrected @xmath59 positions of stars measured in adjacent visits were matched and placed on a common grid .",
    "starting from the image at one extreme of the strip , the other images were registered using a linear plate model transformation of this type : @xmath61 where the parameters @xmath62 , giving the location of the tile on the strip , were determined through a minimization procedure ; the typical rms of the linear fit resulted about 1 milli - arcsecond .",
    "a master catalog was built for each strip , listing all distortion corrected , registered and averaged @xmath59 positions .",
    "the sources on each master catalog with counterparts in the 2mass catalog were identified and a least - square solution was found to derive their ra and dec in the 2mass  system .",
    "the shifts calculated for each strip were used to update the wcs information in the corresponding @xmath49_flt.fits  header file .",
    "these new updated flat - fielded images were used as input to multidrizzle .",
    "the same shifts derived for the f850lp filters were used for the other filters , since all exposures within a visit were taken without moving the telescope and the positional offsets between different filters are generally smaller than a pixel .",
    "the @xmath49_drz.fitsimages are corrected for cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic ray removal was done in the driz_cr step of multidrizzle by comparing the value of a pixel in each input image to the  min \" or ",
    "median \" combination of the values in the other images .",
    "this process is extremely sensitive to alignment errors and source variability .",
    "if the alignment is less than perfect , the very sharp psf  core of the ( normally two in our case )  detections may fall on different pixels and therefore be flagged as cosmic rays and removed in the following combination step .",
    "an early attempt of combining frames from multiple strips into a few large `` supertiles '' of @xmath63 pixels resulted in images with less than optimal astrometric and photometric quality .",
    "it was found that the best results in the image registration could be obtained working on a strip - by - strip basis , i.e. with images taken with the same telescope orientation . to keep the size of the reduced images below 1 gb , we had to split each final strip in two halves , left and right .",
    "the full set of drizzled images , produced with the standard north - up , east - left orientation , is thus composed of 18 mosaics per filter , each one corresponding to half of a strip . the visits included in each strip are listed in table  [ tab : strips ] .",
    "the early set of @xmath63 supertiles was used to produce the large color picture of the orion nebula , as described in the appendix .",
    "the celestial coordinates reported in our source catalog are in the absolute astrometric reference of 2mass , with a precision of the order of a few tens of milli - arcsecond , as the the typical 2mass precision for a single source is @xmath64100  mas @xcite .",
    "their relative positions , however , preserve the centroid precision of acs / wfc of a few milli - arcseconds ( depending on the brightness of the sources , of the background and on the source morphology ) .",
    "accurate astrometris analysis should therefore be performed only on sources belonging to the same strip .",

    "a smooth function was fit to the vignetted edge in the ratio image and then expanded into a 2-d vignetting correction image ( one per filter for f110w and f160w ) that was applied to all affected exposures .",
    "a further `` delta - flat '' correction was applied by median averaging all images taken at the same fom  positions , rejecting those more affected by diffuse nebular emission or point sources . after determining the offsets of individual images of each region by measuring",
    "the centroids of common stars , all images belonging to the same dither group were distortion corrected and combined using wdrizzle version 3.4.1 into a @xmath26 image , preserving the nominal scale of @xmath67  arcsec / pixel and with an alignment such that pixel @xmath68 of the central image of each group falls at pixel @xmath69 of the output image . a final cosmic rays and bad pixel rejection process",
    "was performed by using a custom rejection procedure that compares minimum and median values of pixels commons to multiple frames .",

    "having typically only two exposures , often taken days apart , the cosmic - ray removal algorithm may flag for removal the psf core of the brighter image . to ensure photometric accuracy ,",
    "our main photometric catalog has therefore been extracted from the @xmath49_flt.fits   images .",
    "this means that our source catalog will report , in most cases , multiple detections for each source , one for each visit .",
    "as the @xmath49_flt.fits  images are affected by cosmic rays , for each source and each filter we carefully tuned the aperture radius to avoid the presence of a cosmic ray .",
    "aperture photometry was then obtained using a typical extraction radius of 10 pixels , occasionally reduced to exclude a cosmic ray .",
    "typical sky annuli were between 10 and 15 pixels , but when visual inspection showed strong spatial variability of the background , the sky annulus was adjusted accordingly to get a more reliable estimate of the local background .",
    "having used a gain of 2 e-/adu ( see section  [ section : observations : instruments - setup : acs ] ) , we could also extract the photometry of isolated saturated sources up to blooming distances of about 10 pixels .",

    "the set of acs images presented in this paper has been used to obtain the most detailed images of the orion nebula to date .",
    "we describe here the process of producing a color composite image from the assembled hubble data for distribution to the public , media and astronomers .    working with over one billion pixels of high dynamic range acs data presented practical challenges .",
    "an equivalent challenge was producing an image distinct from the gallery of existing photographs of this popular target , but not so unusual as to appear unrealistic .",
    "compromises were necessary to achieve a result with an unwieldy volume of data and subjective choices , made for largely aesthetic reasons , were needed to arrive at the final product .",
    "the entire process was carried out in collaboration with the science team , keeping in mind a set of main goals : 1 ) produce a visually striking image , with 2 ) realistic overall appearance , tonality and color ; 3 ) render coolest stars red , hottest stars blue ; 4 ) represent the broad dynamic range in the data .",
    "5 ) render detailed structure present in the data ; 6 ) stay honest to the data .",
    "the data used as input were the 7 overlapping tiles , each @xmath116  px ( 174  mpx ) mentioned in section  [ section : datareduction : acsdrizzling ] and shown in figure  [ fig : supertiles ] .",
    "this amounts to 35 fits files , 1.35  gb each .",
    "fully assembled , accounting for overlap and some margin , they correspond to @xmath117  px or 1.1  gpx .",
    "the first step was to scale each of the 35 input files into an editable , 16 bits per channel ( bpc ) image .",
    "since the acs data were processed and calibrated consistently , the same intensity - scaling parameters could be used for each tile and filter .",
    "parameters were adjusted to produce a wide , smooth range of tones , with detail apparent in the brightest ( highlight ) and darkest ( shadow ) regions across all of the images ( figure  [ fig:35supertiles ] ) .",
    "the next step converted each set of the seven 16 bpc tiles , one set for each filer , i nto a single mosaic .",
    "the image size had to be reduced by a factor of two in each dimension because hardware and software limitations prevented working with the full - size , 16-bit images .",
    "while there was a strong desire to keep the image at the native pixel scale ( 0@xmath118.050/pixel ) , it soon became clear that this would have been highly impractical , given the state of the art in desktop processing at the time and the size of the full - scale image , @xmath119  pixel or some 1.2  gpx .",
    "given the additional overhead of multiple image and adjustment layers , masks , etc .",
    ", for image editing , anything larger than a @xmath120  pixel proved prohibitive ( figure  [ fig:35superimages ] ) .    the most straightforward way to reconstruct a color image assigns different images to the three additive primary color channels , red , green , and blue .",
    "however , it is possible to make a color composite with more than three constituent images using a layering paradigm to assign hue to individual gray scale images . after testing various combinations of filters and color assignments , the two reddest filters , f850lp and f775w",
    "were averaged into a single image .",
    "the final color adjustments were : f658n was rendered in red / orange , f850lp+ f775w in red , f555win green , and f435w in blue ( see table [ tab : assigned - colors - for - colorcomposite ] and figure  [ fig : initialcolorcomposite ] ) .",
    "the next step was the matching with ground based data .",
    "this was necessary because the acs survey was not designed to fill out a rectangular pattern .",
    "the combination of stripes resulted in a mosaic with ragged edges and a few interior gaps .",
    "we felt that a clean , rectangular composition would be more appropriate for a public presentation of the image , as the irregular edges would strongly distract viewers from the primary subject and finely detailed structure of the image .",
    "the science team provided another set of data in five filters : together with the wfi u , band h@xmath16 data presented by @xcite , we used two unpublished images also taken at the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope , one in sulfur ( [ s ii ] ) and the other in the oxygen ( [ o iii ] ) filter .",
    "these images matched closely enough the passbands of their closest acs filters ( figure  [ fig : eso ] ) .",
    "the _ hst _  data where then scaled from the full - dynamic - range fits into 16-bit images .",
    "slightly different scaling parameters were used for each image , though a logarithmic transformation was used for all .",
    "the goal was to balance shadow and highlight values with a consistent tonal range among the four images used .",
    "the scaled eso data were finally combined with the _ hst _  data scaled at the eso pixel size , 16-bits , separately for each filter combination .",
    "a mask was generated starting with the non - black pixels in each _ hst _  image .",
    "this mask was modified to blend the two images smoothly ( figure  [ fig : mask ] .",
    "brightness adjustments were applied to match the images where they overlap .",
    "in addition to the large areas of blank data filled by the eso images , areas were blended to fill in smaller gaps .",
    "after up - resampling the masked composite to the _ hst _  pixel size , the _ hst _  images were reincorporated to produce a flat , 16-bit version of each filter / color , cropped to the final orientation and size , @xmath119  px ( 1.2gpx ) .",
    "the next step was the creation of a color composite from the combined _ hst _  and eso images , based on the initial prototypes with the _ hst _  data only .",
    "brightness , contrast , and color balance adjustments were applied at this stage , both to the individual filter components and to the combined image .",
    "masks were used to apply adjustments to localized areas with the goal of preserving detail and maximizing local contrast across the image ( figure  [ fig : adjustments ] ) .      at this point",
    "the image was downsized by 2@xmath43 in each dimension , 18,000@xmath4318,000 pixels ( 309  mpx ) , before applying further adjustments to improve brightness , contrast and color .",
    "again , masks were used to apply adjustments in selected regions to expand the overall tonal range . to further facilitate additional editing , the flat",
    ", 16-bit color composite was tiled into four pieces in a 2x2 array .",
    "* ccd saturation bleeding * diffraction spikes * residual cosmic rays * internal reflections : primarily on brightest stars in the ground - based image , resulting from light reflecting , from filters and other optical elements within the instrument .",
    "most of these artifacts were removed from our orion nebula image using standard digital editing techniques , paying great attention to avoid changing the character of the underlying image ( figure  [ fig : cosmetic ] ) .",
    "after retouching , the four flattened tiles were reassembled into a full , flat mosaic .",
    "some additional adjustments were applied , mostly to increase the overall contrast , enhancing detail in the shadows while taking care not to lose detail in the highlights .",
    "a slight sharpening was applied to the final , flat image .",
    "care was taken to do it in a minimal amount to avoid introducing visible sharpening artifacts .",
    "finally , the overall contrast was slightly enhanced by inserting a copy of the image to which a moderate high - pass filter had been applied at @xmath122 opacity ( figure  [ fig : final ] ) ."
