    "the study of spontaneous pattern formation in materials constitutes an important application of the calculus of variations to materials science . from a variational viewpoint ,",
    "the origin of microstructure is related to a nonconvexity of the energy density , and to boundary conditions which favour states which correspond to a mixture of different minima of the energy density . in continuum mechanics",
    "typically the independent variable is the gradient of a vector field , which obeys the zero - curl differential condition , leading to strong constraints on the admissible microstructures .",
    "the theory of relaxation studies the effective behavior of nonconvex variational problems which lack lower semicontinuity and possibly existence of minimizers , but does not give detailed information on the type of microstructure expected @xcite .    a finer analysis can be done if a regularization is included , in the form of a convex higher - order term , which physically may represent interfacial energies .",
    "an exact determination of the minimizers and the minimal energy is , for these more complex problems , typically impossible .",
    "already a study of the optimal scaling of the energy with respect to the parameters of the problem may , however , give very valuable information .",
    "starting with the works of landau @xcite on micromagnetism , branching - type patterns have been predicted and observed .",
    "they are characterized by coarse oscillations in the interior , which refine close to the boundary , as illustrated in figure [ figlambr ] . at a heuristic level",
    ", the transition between coarse and fine oscillations can be understood as the result of the competition between the miminization of the total length of the interfaces , the energetic cost of bending the domains , and the boundary conditions .",
    "the mathematical study of the subject began with the work of kohn and mller in the 90s @xcite , who proposed a simple scalar model for martensitic microstructures close to an interface with austenite , see section  [ sec : introkm ] below for details .",
    "their basic finding was the presence of a transition between a regime in which the energy scales proportional to @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the surface energy density and @xmath2 the ratio between the austenite and the martensite elastic coefficients , and a regime in which the energy scales proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the first regime corresponds to a one - dimensional laminar pattern , the second one to a branching - type pattern , as illustrated in figure [ figlambr ] .",
    ".8 cm     their results have been refined in specific regimes @xcite , extended to related scalar - valued models in different parameter regimes @xcite and to vector - valued models @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained in other variational models , including the magnetic structures in ferromagnets originally studied by landau @xcite , flux - domain patterns in type - i superconductors @xcite , diblock copolymers @xcite , blistering of thin compressed films @xcite , wrinkling of stretched thin films @xcite , dislocation patterns in crystal plasticity @xcite , and compliance minimization @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we specifically focus on two problems in this class where the expected microstructure is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "the first one , and the simpler one , is the kohn - mller functional . the second one is the scalar , but three - dimensional , model of crystal plasticity from @xcite .",
    "we present the first model , its physical interpretation and the main results on this functional in section [ sec : introkm ] , the other one in section [ sec : introplastic ] . after mentioning some notation in section [ secnotation ] ,",
    "we give the proofs for the scaling laws for the two models in sections [ secpfkm ] and [ sec : disloc ] respectively .",
    "we now introduce our model for martensitic microstructures . following kohn and mller",
    "@xcite we work for simplicity in two dimensions , in antiplane shear geometry , with the scalar field @xmath4 representing a deformation in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "we consider one interface between austenite and martensite , located at @xmath5 , with austenite on the right and martensite on the left , as sketched in figure [ fig - geometry ] . in the austenite , which for simplicity is assumed to extend to infinity",
    ", the minimum of the elastic energy is attained at @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath7 represents the ratio of the elastic coefficients of austenite and martensite , respectively ( this parameter is often denoted by @xmath8 in the literature ) . in the martensite , which we assume to cover the domain @xmath9 , there are two minima of the elastic energy density . after scaling ,",
    "we can write the energy as @xmath10 where admissible functions @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 almost everywhere in @xmath13 , for some @xmath14}}$ ] . we denote by @xmath15 the distributional derivative , in the last term @xmath16 is assumed to be a measure and the term has to be understood distributionally .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath17 represents the order parameter of the martensitic phase transition , and its preferred values are dictated by crystallography .",
    "the first two terms in model the elastic energy contributions of the austenite and the martensite part , respectively .",
    "the last term in is a regularization term which penalizes changes in the order parameter , and prevents arbitrarily fine microstructures .",
    "it can thus be interpreted as a surface energy term , @xmath1 being a typical surface energy constant per unit length .",
    "the energy functional is normalized to set the elastic modulus of martensite to one .",
    "+ mathematically , the parameter @xmath18 represents a compatibility condition . for @xmath19",
    ", there exist trivial configurations with vanishing energy , while for @xmath20 , the minimal energy is strictly positive , and we expect the formation of microstructures . by swapping the two variants of microstructure",
    "one can assume without loss of generality that @xmath21 .",
    "experimental findings suggest that the size of @xmath18 is closely linked to the width of the thermal hysteresis loop in the austenite - martensite phase transition @xcite , and such low - hysteresis alloys have been found to exhibit peculiar microstructures , see e.g. @xcite .         for the symmetric case @xmath22 , the scaling law for the minimal energy has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we point out that the same scaling law for holds if one restricts to periodic functions @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath23 , and if @xmath24 , then the scaling results for @xmath25 can be generalized to the case @xmath26 with the obvious modifications in the lower bound , and the same kinds of test functions to prove the upper bound ( see @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "one observes only scaling regimes that correspond to uniform structures , to laminated structures or to geometrically refining branching patterns ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show in this paper that for @xmath27 there is an intermediate regime between laminates and branching , with the geometry sketched in figure  [ fig : fig - new ] .",
    "a related intermediate regime between the branching constructions and the laminates in case of highly unequal volume fractions has been observed in a three - dimensional model of type - i superconductors @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the energy was different , and also the geometry was not the same as here .",
    "indeed , in the superconducting case the conservation of flux forces the minority ( normal ) phase to be connected , as in the left panel of figure [ fig : fig - new ] . here",
    "a second construction is possible , in which the majority phase is connected , as in the right panel of figure [ fig : fig - new ] , which has a smaller surface energy , as will become clear in lemma [ lem : branch ] below . for the dislocation problem only the second construction gives the optimal energy scaling .",
    "we consider the case of general @xmath2 , in particular @xmath27 .",
    "it turns out that in this case the choice of boundary conditions at the top and bottom boundaries matter .",
    "precisely , we consider two natural classes of admissible functions , the first one with neumann boundary conditions on the horizontal sides , @xmath28 and the one with periodic boundary conditions on the horizontal sides , @xmath29 we prove the following scaling laws for @xmath30 ( see propositions [ prop : kmub ] and [ prop : kmlb ] ) .",

    "the two slip systems can not be both activated at the same point in space , therefore the plastic strain @xmath8 is pointwise parallel to either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "we further assume that each slip system is only active with one orientation .",
    "the class of admissible deformations and plastic strains therefore takes the form @xmath53 here and in the rest of the paper , given a vector @xmath54 we denote the components along @xmath55 and @xmath56 by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the cartesian ones by @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the energy is given by the sum of the elastic energy and the line - tension energy of the geometrically necessary dislocations .",
    "dislocations are topological defects in crystals which are responsible for plastic deformation processes , they are necessarily present whenever the plastic part of the deformation gradient is not a gradient field itself . geometrically necessary dislocations are the dislocations whose presence can be inferred from the fact that the plastic strain @xmath8 is not a gradient field . starting from a variety of microscopic models it has been proven that the energetic contribution of such dislocations is linear in the curl of @xmath8 , with a coefficient which depends on the local burgers vector and slip - plane normal , see for example @xcite .    working in the coordinates @xmath61 it is easy to see that the relevant terms are @xmath62 and @xmath63 . a detailed analysis of the latent - hardening condition from a relaxation viewpoint leads to the interpretation of @xmath64 as @xmath65 , where both derivatives are interpreted distributionally , see @xcite for a motivation . in the present",

    "the energy scaling for the case of the far - field deformation @xmath76 , corresponding to a half - half mixture of the two slip directions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , was studied in @xcite .",
