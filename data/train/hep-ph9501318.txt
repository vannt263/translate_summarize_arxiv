    ", there appeared a dramatic increase in the number of studies utilizing chpt to analyze hadrons at low energies .",
    "however , most of these involved either tree - level or one - loop calculations . in fact , there currently exists a need for higher - order calculations which meaningfully probe the convergence properties of chpt .",
    "this forms an important impetus for performing our calculation .",
    "there is a more phenomenologically - oriented way of stating our motivation which actually bears on future applications of our work  the subject of chiral sum rules",

    "the next two relations are respectively the first and second weinberg sum rules.@xmath12 the final sum rule is a formula for the @xmath13-@xmath14 mass splitting in the chiral limit.@xmath15 although apparently containing an arbitrary energy scale @xmath16 , this sum rule is actually independent of @xmath16 by virtue of the preceding relation .",
    "although the above sum rules were derived almost @xmath17 years ago , a full phenomenological test of their content was not carried out until recently@xmath18 . in principle , the underlying strategy employed in ref .",
    "@xcite was to divide the energy region into three intervals as follows . in the large energy region , from @xmath19 down to energies where data first become available , operator product expansion methods were used . at intermediate energies , the vector and axialvector spectral functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 were extracted from tau decay distributions and @xmath22 cross sections .",
    "finally , the threshold behavior ( @xmath23 ) of the spectral functions was constrained by means of chiral symmetry . in practice , however , this final step was not found to be crucial to the calculation and as a result was not implemented .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ultimately led to a successful fit to all four chiral sum rules , which is highly nontrivial in view of the strong distortions experienced by the spectral functions from the various moments .",

    "one readily sees that it does not take long for the one - loop prediction to disagree with experiment as the energy is increased above the two - pion threshold .",
    "this is one of several reasons for computing to the next order of chpt.@xmath25    we conclude this section with an outline of the rest of the paper .",

    "the lowest - order lagrangian @xmath26 is used to illustrate certain aspects of the discussion .",

    "section 4 covers the counterterm analysis , reviewing the presence of the @xmath4 counterterms and especially generating a complete list of @xmath2 counterterms relevant for our purposes .",
    "section 5 contains a statement of our renormalization procedure",
    ". the use of the renormalization group ( rg hereafter ) to determine the scale dependence of various counterterms is discussed and the rg equations are solved to the needed order .",
    "section 6 contains the explicit representations for the isospin and hypercharge vector current propagators which result from our calculation .",
    "section 7 contains two applications of our results .",
    "the improved isospin vector spectral function , now containing next - to - leading order contributions , is again compared with data .",
    "in addition , the asymptotic behaviour of the vector - propagators is employed to derive a new set of chiral sum rules .",
    "we conclude the main body of the paper in section 8 by summarizing our findings and proposing further research on the subject .",
    "there are also two appendices , the first devoted to defining the @xmath28-dimensional integrals which occur in our calculation and the second to giving an independent determination of the isospin spectral function @xmath29 at next - to - leading order .",
