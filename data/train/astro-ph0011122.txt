    "the importance of turbulence in the process of star formation was recognized long ago ( von weizscker 1951 ) , and was discussed in a seminal paper by larson ( 1981 ) .",
    "several successive works have tried to use the observational data to relate different properties of mcs with the physics of laboratory and numerical turbulence , such as power spectra of kinetic energy , probability distributions of velocity and velocity differences , intermittency ( falgarone & phillips 1990 ; falgarone & puget 1995 ; falgarone , pineau des forets , & roueff 1995 ) , and self  similarity .    during the last decade , numerical simulations of transonic turbulence ( passot & pouquet 1987 ; passot , pouquet & woodward 1988 ; lorat , passot & pouquet 1990 ; lee , lele & moin 1991 ; porter , pouquet & woodward 1992 ; kimura & tosa 1993 ; porter , woodward & pouquet 1994 ; vazquez  semadeni 1994 ; passot , vazquez  semadeni & pouquet 1995 ) and highly super  sonic turbulence ( passot , vzquez ",

    "recent numerical studies of super  sonic magneto  hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence have brought new understanding of the physics of turbulence .",
    "the most important results are :    * super  sonic turbulence decays in approximately one dynamical time , independent of the magnetic field strength ( padoan & nordlund 1997 , 1999 ; maclow et al .",
    "1998 ; stone , ostriker & gammie 1998 ; maclow 1999 ) . *",
    "the probability distribution of gas density in isothermal turbulence is well approximated by a log  normal distribution , whose standard deviation is a function of the rms mach number of the flow ( vazquez  semadeni 1994 ; padoan 1995 ; padoan , jones & nordlund 1997 ; scalo et al .",

    "super  sonic isothermal turbulence generates a complex system of shocks which fragment the gas very efficiently into high density sheets , filaments , and cores ( this is the general result of any numerical simulation of super  sonic turbulence ) . *",
    "super  alfvnic turbulence provides a good description of the dynamics of mcs , and an explanation for the origin of dense cores with magnetic field strength consistent with zeeman splitting observations .",
    "( padoan & nordlund 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "we call `` turbulent fragmentation '' the process of generation of high density structures by turbulent shocks . since random super  sonic motions are ubiquitous in mcs , turbulent fragmentation can not be avoided : it is a direct consequence of the observational evidence . in some analytical studies",
    "it is tacitly assumed that turbulent fragmentation can be neglected if the kinetic energy of random motions is in rough equipartition with the magnetic energy .",
    "this assumption is wrong , because motions along magnetic field lines are unavoidable , and so turbulent fragmentation occurs via super ",
    "sonic compressions along the magnetic field lines , as discussed by gammie & ostriker ( 1996 ) and padoan & nordlund ( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of turbulence have been used to discuss the turbulent origin of mc structures by passot & pouquet ( 1987 ) .",
    "semadeni , passot & pouquet ( 1996 ) and ballesteros  paredes , hartmann & vazquez  semadeni ( 1999 ) have used two dimensional simulations to argue that mcs are formed by turbulence .",
    "padoan & nordlund ( 1997 , 1999 ) have shown that super  sonic and super  alfvnic turbulence can explain the origin of magnetized cores in mcs , including the observed field strength  density ( @xmath2 ) relation ( myers & goodman 1988 ; fiebig & gsten 1989 ; crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "the idea that proto ",
    "stellar cores and stars are formed in turbulent shocks has been previously discussed by elmegreen ( 1993 ) . in that work",
    ", an analysis of the gravitational instability of the cores can be found . here",
    ", we present new strong observational evidence in favor of the turbulent shock origin of proto  stellar cores . such evidence is based on the fact that dense post shock gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocity dispersion than lower density gas , since it maps regions of converging flows , where the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is dissipated .    in  2 and 3 , numerical simulations and observational data , used in this work ,",
    "are briefly described . in ",
    "4 we compute the rms flow velocity as a function of the gas density , in simulations of super  sonic turbulence , and show that it decreases for increasing values of the gas density . in ",
    "5 we show that such general property generates an observable relation between the rms velocity centroid and the integrated intensity ( roughly proportional to the surface density ) , for the  transition , and in  6 the same relation is found in the observational data .",
    "results are discussed in  7 , and conclusions are summarized in  8 .",
    "the numerical models used in this work are based on the results of numerical simulations of super  alfvnic and highly super  sonic mhd turbulence , run on a 128@xmath3 computational mesh , with periodic boundary conditions . as in our previous works ,",
    "the initial density and magnetic fields are uniform ; the initial velocity is random , generated in fourier space with power only on the large scale .",
    "we also apply an external random force , to drive the turbulence at a roughly constant rms mach number of the flow .",
    "this force is generated in fourier space , with power only on small wave numbers ( @xmath4 ) , as the initial velocity .",
    "the isothermal equation of state is used .",
    "descriptions of the numerical code used to solve the mhd equations can be found in galsgaard & nordlund ( 1996 ) ; nordlund , stein & galsgaard ( 1996 ) ; nordlund & galsgaard ( 1997 ) ; padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) .",
    "in this work we neglect the effect of self  gravity , although that can be described with a different version of our code ( padoan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "here we compare the relative velocity of regions of mc complexes as a function of their gas density or column density .",
    "such regions are distributed across the full extension of the mc complexes , that is several pc . in our numerical models ,",
    "driven continuously by an external force on the large scale , self  gravity is responsible for the collapse of gravitationally bound cores formed by the turbulent flow , but does not affect significantly the large scale flow . since we assume that large scale motions in mc complexes are due to turbulence , and not to a gravitational collapse , we can neglect self  gravity . similarly , we have neglected the effect of ambipolar drift , since it is not relevant for motions on the scale of several pc , although that is computed in a different version of our code , using the strong coupling approximation ( see padoan , zweibel & nordlund 2000 ) .    in order to scale the models to physical units ,",
    "we use the following empirical larson type relations , as in our previous works :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the rms sonic mach number of the flow , and a temperature @xmath7  k is assumed , and @xmath8 where the gas density @xmath9 is expressed in @xmath10 .",
    "the rms sonic mach number is an input parameter of the numerical simulations , and can be used to re - scale them to physical units .",
    "when comparing theoretical models with observations , @xmath6 is in fact the only parameter that we need to match ( or its two dimensional equivalent on the maps , @xmath11 see  3 ) . in the absence of self  gravity and magnetic field",
    ", statistical properties of turbulent flows ( very large reynolds number ) with the same value of @xmath6 should be universal , and independent of the average density ( for isothermal flows without self  gravity ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is present , the rms alfvnic mach number of the flow is also an input parameter of the numerical simulations ( it determines the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "the physical unit of velocity in the code is the isothermal speed of sound , @xmath12 , and the physical unit of the magnetic field is @xmath13 ( cgs ) .    in this work",
    "we use two numerical models with rms velocity 3.4 and 1.7 km / s , which corresponds to @xmath14 and 6.5 respectively . using the larson type relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we get @xmath15 and 10.5 pc and @xmath16 and 190 @xmath10 .",
    "the one dimensional rms velocity for the two models is @xmath17 and 1.0 km / s , which are also recovered from the analysis of the synthetic spectral maps computed with these models .",
    "the values of @xmath11 have been chosen for the appropriate comparison with the observational data presented in   3 .",
    "km / s , and @xmath18  pc , while the larson type relation ( 1 ) would give @xmath19  pc . for the purpose of this work",
    "we are interested in comparing the observations with numerical models with similar rms mach number , and we do not try to match the physical extension of each mc complex . ]",
    "the magnetic field strength is @xmath20  @xmath21 g in both models .",
    "maps of synthetic spectra of molecular transitions are computed , using a non  lte monte carlo radiative transfer code ( juvela 1997 , 1998 ) , from the three dimensional density and velocity fields generated in the numerical mhd experiments .",
    "the method of computing synthetic spectra was presented in padoan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for the purpose of this work we use only one molecular transition , namely  .",
    "uniform temperature , @xmath7  k is assumed for these radiative transfer calculations , in agreement with the isothermal equation of state used in the mhd calculations .",
    "we are presently computing thermal equilibrium models of mcs that we will use in a future work to study the effect of realistic temperature variations in molecular spectra .",
    "since the spectral noise resulting from uncertainties in our radiative transfer calculations is always much smaller than the typical observational noise , the comparison of synthetic spectra with observational data can be done only after adding noise to the synthetic spectra , and the effect of noise on the statistical properties of the spectra need to be quantified ( see  4 ) .",
    "we choose to use the  transition because it samples the range of values of column density we are here interested in , and also because several large maps of molecular clouds are available in this transition .",
    "we compare maps of  synthetic spectra with some of the largest observational  spectral maps in the literature from the following galactic regions : the perseus mc complex ( billawala , bally & sutherland 1997 ) , the taurus mc complex ( mizuno et al . 1995 ) , the rosette mc complex ( blitz & stark 1986 ; heyer et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these mc complexes have an extension of approximately 3050  pc , and radial velocity dispersions in the range 12.4  km / s .",
    "we define the total rms velocity of a map as the rms velocity weighted with the total spectrum of the map , @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 the blitz & stark map of the rosette mc complex has @xmath25  km / s , but , limited to the region that matches the more recent heyer et al .",
    "map , the value is @xmath17  km / s ( for both maps ) .",
    "the full map of the perseus mc complex also yields a value of @xmath17  km / s .",
    "taurus is instead much less turbulent , despite its large spatial extent , with @xmath26  km / s .",
    "the angular resolution is inversely proportional to the diameter of the antenna : 4 m for the taurus map , 7 m for the perseus and the blitz & stark rosette maps , and 14 m for the heyer et al .",
    "map of rosette . assuming a distance of 140 pc for taurus , 300 pc for perseus , and 1600 pc for rosette ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the maps is 0.1 pc for taurus , 0.15 pc for perseus , 0.84 pc for the blitz & stark map of rosette , and 0.42 pc for the heyer et al .",
    "map of rosette .",
    "the spectral resolution is 0.1 km / s for taurus , 0.273 km / s for perseus , 0.68 km / s for the blitz & stark map of rosette , and 0.06 km / s for the heyer et al .",
    "map of the same cloud .",
    "rms noise @xmath27 and average spectrum quality @xmath28 ( see padoan , rosolowsky & goodman 2000 ) also vary from map to map .",
    "the spectrum quality , @xmath29 , is related to the signal  to  noise , @xmath30 .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the rms signal ( over the whole spectrum or inside a velocity window ) to the rms noise , @xmath27 : @xmath31 the usual definition of @xmath30 is based on gaussian fits of the spectra , which we prefer to avoid because the  transition typically yields spectra with significant non  gaussian shape and multiple components .",
    "the spectrum quality is a sort of signal  to  noise weighted over the whole spectrum .",
    "the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 is discussed in padoan , goodman & rosolowsky ( 2000 ) .",
    "we call average spectrum quality @xmath28 the value of @xmath29 averaged over the whole map",
    ". values of @xmath28 , @xmath27 , resolutions and @xmath11 are listed in table  1 for all the observational maps . in the following , when different maps are compared with each other , we make noise and velocity resolution equal in the different maps , by adding noise and reducing the velocity resolution where necessary .",
    "turbulent fragmentation generates a complex system of dense post shock sheets , filaments and cores , reminiscent of structures observed in molecular cloud ( mc ) maps .",
    "an example of a two dimensional projection of the three dimensional density field from a simulation of super  sonic turbulence is shown in figure  1 . in previous works ( padoan , jones & nordlund 1997 ;",
    "padoan & nordlund 1997 , 1999 ) , we have shown that , besides this morphological similarity , the density field of numerical super ",
    "sonic turbulence has important statistical properties in agreement with the density field of observed mcs .",
    "figure  2 ( left panel ) is a two dimensional section ( no projection ) of the same three - dimensional density field used in figure  1 .",
    "a complex system of filaments is apparent , with a number of high density cores inside the filaments . in three dimensional super  sonic turbulence ,",
    "filaments are formed by two dimensional compressions ( at the intersection of sheets ) and the densest cores are formed by three dimensional compressions .",
    "most of the `` filaments '' in two dimensional sections like figure  2 , are instead two dimensional cuts through sheets , and most of the cores are local density maxima , due to fluctuations in the shock velocity ( they usually corresponds to strongly curved segments of filaments ) .",
    "such density maxima are often unstable to gravitational collapse , and are the origin of proto  stellar cores .",
    "since the dense gas originates in shocks , that is in regions of converging flows , it should move with significantly lower velocity than the lower density turbulent flow .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of figure  2 , which shows the magnitude of the flow velocity on the same plane as the left panel .",
    "dark blue is low velocity , and dark red high velocity .",
    "it is clear that high density filaments trace regions of low velocity , at the intersections of high velocity `` blobs '' .",
    "this general property of super  sonic turbulence is quantified by the dependence of the rms flow velocity , @xmath32 , on the gas density : @xmath33 we repeat for different values of @xmath34 , and than plot the result versus the gas density .",
    "expression ( 6 ) means that the rms flow velocity is obtained as an average over the whole computational box , using only positions where the gas density has a value contained in an interval centered around @xmath34 .",
    "the average is repeated for different intervals of values of @xmath34 , to span the whole range of densities .",
    "the plot is shown in figure  3 , at time @xmath35 ( square symbols ) and @xmath36 ( asterisks ) , where @xmath37 is the time in units of the dynamical time ( defined as the size of the computational box divided by the rms flow velocity ) , and the density is uniform in the initial conditions , at @xmath38 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "regions of @xmath39 have @xmath32 comparable to the total rms velocity , @xmath40  km / s , while regions with 10 times higher density have much smaller rms velocity , @xmath41  km / sec , and at @xmath42 @xmath43  km / s .",
    "the rms velocity conditioned to the gas density decreases sharply with increasing gas density already at a very early time , @xmath35 , when the density field is still very smooth .",
    "observational spectral maps of mcs , do not provide a direct estimate of the three dimensional velocity field and gas density . only radial velocity and velocity  integrated intensity ( which is roughly proportional to the surface density ) , averaged along each line of sight , are directly available from the data .",
    "however , the dependence of the rms velocity centroid on the integrated intensity should resemble the @xmath44 relation , since lines of sight of high intensity are usually dominated by one or more dense cores .",
    "the velocity centroid , @xmath45 , is the average velocity along an individual line of sight @xmath46 on the map : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the signal ( antenna temperature ) , at the velocity @xmath49 and position @xmath46 , and @xmath50 is the width of the velocity channel .",
    "the integrated intensity , @xmath51 , is : @xmath52    we compute the rms velocity centroid , @xmath53 , conditioned on @xmath54 : @xmath55 ( spatial average ) and plot it against @xmath54 .",
    "expression ( 9 ) means that the rms velocity centroid is obtained as an average over the whole map , selecting all lines  of  sight on the map with values of @xmath54 inside a given interval , [ @xmath56 .",
    "this rms velocity centroid is not equivalent to a local line width , because it is obtained as an average over the whole map .",
    "the plot is shown in figure  4 , for two maps of  synthetic spectra with different total line widths @xmath11 ( defined in  3 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows that @xmath53 decreases significantly for increasing values of @xmath54 .",
    "the general property of super  sonic turbulence , namely high density gas moves relatively slowly , is therefore apparent also in the observable relation @xmath0 .",
    "the relation @xmath0 is affected by noise and by the width of the velocity channels , which must be taken into account when comparing different maps .",
    "noise has been added to the synthetic spectra used for computing the plot in figure  4 , to yield a value of the spectrum quality comparable to a typical value found in the observational data used in this work , @xmath57 ( see  3 for the definition of @xmath28 ) .    in figure  5",
    "we show the effect of noise ( left panel ) and spectral resolution ( right panel ) .",
    "the effect of increasing the noise ( decreasing the value of @xmath28 ) is that of making the @xmath0 relation steeper , because the uncertainty in the determination of the velocity centroids due to noise contributes to the dispersion of velocity centroid values , and the effect increases at decreasing values of integrated intensity @xmath54 .",
    "lower spectral resolution further increases the same effect .",
    "however , we have verified that if the noise is low enough , @xmath58 , both noise and velocity resolution have no effect on the @xmath0 relation , and the squared symbols in the left panel of figure  5 correspond therefore to the intrinsic relations .",
    "we can conclude that this observable relation truly originates from the three dimensional @xmath44 relation , with only a partial contribution from noise .",
    "we have also verified that spatial resolution does not affect our results .",
    "the spatial resolution can be decreased significantly , by rebinning the map to a smaller number of spectra , without any appreciable variation in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "as the spatial resolution is decreased , however , the statistical sample ( number of spectra ) decreases , and statistical fluctuations ( deviations around the high resolution @xmath0 relation ) become progressively more important .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the @xmath0 relation is sensitive to the value of the rms noise and to the spectral resolution . in the following plots , where we compare different spectral maps from observations and models ,",
    "we have therefore added noise to the spectra and increased the velocity channel width @xmath50 to match the map with the largest noise and @xmath50 .",
    "we have not modified the spatial resolution in any map , since that has no systematic effect on the @xmath0 relation , as commented above .",
    "the left panel of figure  6 shows the @xmath0 relation for the maps of mc complexes introduced in  3 . for the rosette mc complex we have used the portion of the full blitz & stark map that matches the heyer et al . map .",
    "the two models used for the comparison have @xmath17  km / s , similar to rosette and perseus , and @xmath26  km / s , similar to taurus .",
    "it is remarkable that the rosette and the perseus mc complexes have indistinguishable @xmath0 relations , which are also coincident with the theoretical prediction ( square symbols ) , for the same value of @xmath11 .",
    "the result for taurus is also in good agreement with the @xmath26  km / s model .",
    "horizontal shifts could be expected in the plot , since different mc complexes can have different surface density .",
    "however , mcs and mc complexes are known to approximately follow the larson relation between density and size ( equation ( 2 ) ) , which implies roughly constant surface density , and small horizontal shifts in the plot .    to compute the plots in the left panel of figure  6 ,",
    "all maps have been treated to make their rms noise and velocity resolution equal .",
    "this is achieved by rebinning spectral profiles into a smaller number of velocity channels , and by adding noise , when necessary . in order to check that the @xmath0 relations from different maps treated in this way are really comparable ,",
    "we have computed the @xmath0 relation for the rosette mc complex using both the heyer et al .",
    "map , and the portion of the blitz & stark map that matches the region covered by the heyer et al . map .",
    "the result is plotted in the right panel of figure  6 .",
    "the velocity resolution of the heyer et al .",
    "map has been decreased from @xmath59  km / s to @xmath60  km / s , and noise has been added , to match exactly the velocity resolution and rms noise in the blitz & stark map . as can be seen in the right panel of figure  6 , after this drastic treatment of the higher resolution map , the @xmath0 relations for the two maps are practically indistinguishable from each other , which support the validity of the comparison of different maps ( left panel of figure  6 . in the right panel , the case of the full blitz & stark map is also plotted ( square symbols ) .",
    "the full map has a higher total rms velocity , @xmath61  km / s , than the portion that matches the heyer et al .",

    "stellar cores is a fundamental problem in our understanding of the process of star formation .",

    "we have presented a new statistical method to analyze spectral ",
    "line maps , which is very useful because it probes directly a very general property of super  sonic turbulence , that is the fact that dense gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocity dispersion than lower density gas .",
    "this property arises because the gas density is enhanced in regions where the large scale turbulent flow converges ( compressions ) and the kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is dissipated by shocks . if local compressions are instead due to local instabilities ( e.g. gravitational instability , or gravitational instability mediated by ambipolar diffusion ) , and the large scale motions are only the consequence of local instabilities ( as it should be in a self  consistent picture ) , gas density increases with the flow velocity dispersion ( see for example the model by indebetouw & zweibel 2000 ) , contrary to the observational evidence presented in this work .",

    "<S> stellar cores is a central aspect of the process of star formation . because of the turbulent nature of super  sonic motions in mcs , it has been suggested that dense structures such as filaments and clumps are formed by shocks in a turbulent flow . in this work we present strong evidence in favor of the turbulent origin of the fragmentation of mcs .    </S>",
    "<S> the most generic result of turbulent fragmentation is that dense post shock gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocity dispersion than lower density gas , since shocks correspond to regions of converging flows , where the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is dissipated .    using synthetic maps of spectra of molecular transitions , computed from the results of numerical simulations of super  sonic turbulence , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas density generates an observable relation between the rms velocity centroid and the integrated intensity ( column density ) , @xmath0 , which is indeed found in the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the theoretical model ( maps of synthetic @xmath1co spectra ) , with @xmath1co maps from the perseus , rosette and taurus mc complexes , shows excellent agreement in the @xmath0 relation .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 relation of different observational maps with the same total rms velocity are remarkably similar , which is a strong indication of their origin from a very general property of the fluid equations , such as the turbulent fragmentation process .    </S>",
