    "recent proposals for quantum communication @xcite and quantum information protocols @xcite provide a significant incentive to develop practical single photon sources and entangled two photon sources .",
    "the first requirement for such sources is that the emission times of the photons be periodic with a precisely defined clocked frequency .",
    "exciton recombination in electrically or optically excited quantum dots is a candidate system for such sources . in this paper",
    "we will discuss an entangled two photon source based on recent experiments in self assembled interface quantum dots @xcite .",
    "a proposal for producing entangled photon - pairs on demand based on biexciton emission from a quantum dot was recently presented by benson et al .",
    "@xcite .    a pair of excitons confined in a quantum dot form a bound state known as a biexciton .",
    "the decay of the biexciton proceeds by consecutive single electron hole recombination processes .",
    "this is estabished experimentally by the temporal correlation of the biexciton emission and the exciton emission ; time resolved photoluminescence measurements show the exciton photon to be emitted _",
    "after _ the biexciton photon @xcite . a similar time resolved",
    "study of the polarisation of the emitted photons shows that there are two decay paths , and it has been shown that they are coherent with one another @xcite .",
    "while the biexciton photon and the exciton photon emitted in each decay path have the same linear polarisation , the polaristion in different decay paths are orthogonal .",
    "if these decay paths were indistinguishable then this would be a good candidate for an entangled two photon source .",
    "unfortunately small asymmetries in the physical geomery of the dots makes the two paths distinguishable , since the asymmetry of the dot breaks the degeneracy of an intermediate exciton level enabling the two paths to be distinguished by frequency .",
    "the effect of asymmetry on the spectrum of excitons in dots was observed experimentally in dots formed by monolayer fluctuations in a gaas 2d quantum well @xcite and has been addressed theoretically @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed experimentally in cdse / znse dots @xcite and in self assembled gaas / ingaas dots @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels ] we indicate the possible decay paths from a single biexciton level through two non degenerate exciton levels to the ground state of the dot .",
    "the first decay path corresponds to the emission of a biexciton photon with linear polarisation in the @xmath0-direction at frequency @xmath1 , followed by the emission of the exciton photon , with the same polarisation , at frequency @xmath2 . in the second decay path",
    "the biexciton emits a @xmath3-polarised photon at frequency @xmath4 followed by the exciton emission , also with @xmath3-polarisation , at frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the state of the emitted photon pairs may then be written as @xmath6 where the notation indicates the mode ( polarisation and frequency ) occupied by each photon of the pair , @xmath7 , with the order reflecting the order of emission .",
    "it has been established experimentally that the weights of the kets are equal @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we wish to produce a state of the form @xmath8 and we call such a state polarisation entangled , since the entanglement is only in the polarisation degree of freedom .",
    "this is in contrast to the state given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : frequency_entangled ] ) which is entangled in both polarisation and frequency .",
    "the important difference between states @xmath9 and @xmath10 is that the second ket in @xmath10 may be rotated into the first ket using linear optical elements such as half - wave plates ( hwp ) and polarising beam splitters ( pbs ) , and vice - versa , whereas this is not possible for the two kets written in state @xmath9 .",
    "thus , for instance , bell - inequality measurements and two - photon interference experiments may be performed with realtive ease using @xmath9 but not @xmath10 , and this translates to a technological setting in , for instance , quantum key distribution .",
    "the problem of producing frequency - and - polarisation entangled states akin to @xmath11 has been considered for photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear crystal @xcite . in this case photons are also entangled both in polarisation and frequency , though the frequency entanglement is more complicated .",
    "the frequencies for the two emitted photons are constrained by energy conservation , so that their sum must equal the frequency of the absorbed pump photon .",
    "since this single constraint does notdetermine the frequencies of the two emitted photons uniquely , each photon of the pair may be emitted over a wide range of frequencies determined by the spectrum of the pump pulse and the phase matching requirement ( which is an expression of momentum conservation ) .",
    "thus the photon pair is entangled in its frequency degree of freedom .",
    "a resolution to this problem , presented and experimentally implemented in @xcite , is to pass the signal and idler beams back through the crystal , but with the polarisations rotated through @xmath12 , with the result that the two ways in which the photons can be emitted with correlated polarisation are not distinguished by frequency .",
    "this scheme in @xcite does not directly translate to the case of biexcitonic emission , but we nevertheless wish to remove the spectral dependence from the entanglement in state @xmath11 , so the aim of this paper is to present and analyse a proposal to accomplish this for the biexciton entangled photon source .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the frequency may be disentangled from the polarisation by placing the dot in an external cavity with suitably chosen cavity - exciton coupling strengths and cavity mode frequencies .",
    "we will show that the external cavity can erase the  which - path \" information contained in the frequency components of state @xmath11 .",
    "the external cavity is used to control both the spectral and spatial mode structure of the emitted photons to enable the entanglement to be demonstrated in an interferometer .",
    "a similar idea using waveguides for spdc has been proposed by banaszek _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "we note that the original proposal for the two - photon source @xcite includes the external cavity , but its presence is only to increase the outcoupling efficiency , and only brief mention is made of its effect upon the spectral emission properties of the emitted photons .",
    "the next part of this paper begins by defining a hamiltonian for a four level system interacting with optical cavity modes .",
    "a master equation is developed in the third section to deal with photons leaking from the cavity and into some measurement apparatus , as well as to account for decoherence events such as photon loss . in the fourth section ,",
    "we discuss some operational definitions to quantify the entanglement of the photons produced , such as two - photon visibility and bell - inequality violations , with the aid of which we judge the efficacy of the cavity in restoring the polarisation entanglement .",
    "we then provide some results in the fifth and sixth sections showing that an ideal cavity does establish maximally entangled photon pairs , and numerical results showing how sensitive the resulting state is to imperfections in the system parameters .",
    "we then provide some heuristic analytic results in the discussion which explain the numerical results , as well as comment on implications for experiments , and finally conclude the paper .",
    "figure [ fig : energylevels ] shows the energy levels and available dipole transitions for the biexciton - cavity system .",

    "the system hamiltonian , @xmath21 , under the rotating wave and dipole approximations @xcite is then    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the photon annihilation operator and photon number operator for mode @xmath25 , and for convenience we take @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig : energylevels ] .",
    "since the photon pair is only maximally entangled when the amplitudes of the @xmath89 and @xmath314 components are equal in magnitude ( i.e. for the state @xmath315 ) , parameter variations that result in unequal decay path amplitudes result in sub - maximally entangled photon pairs .",
    "such parameter variations correspond directly to the situation of an unbalanced system .",
    "the analysis above gives us some further insight into the decay process .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the photon excitation is @xmath316 and so the leakage rate of photons from the cavity will be suppressed by this factor .",

    "therefore , as the detuning @xmath303 increases , the photon emission rate slows roughly as @xmath318 for @xmath319 .",
    "this will mean that for detunings significantly larger than the coupling strength , leakage effects will become significant  the lifetime of the excitation in the cavity will become comparable to the decay rate for dephasing or spontaneous emission .",
    "it is also worth noting that when @xmath320 ( i.e. the exciton - cavity detuning is near the biexciton shift ) the model developed in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] breaks down , since significant cross coupling between exciton states and cavity modes will set in .",
    "spontaneous emission decreases the detection probability , which could be corrected with post - selection , since only events in which two - photons are registered count towards the measurement , and as mentioned previously , experimental work has shown that this is negligible for experimentally relevant systems @xcite .",
    "dephasing of intermediate states decreases the visibility exponentially in time .",
    "temperatures of a few kelvin provide sufficiently low dephasing rates that it is negligible , but the excitonic dephasing becomes important at temperatures of several tens of kelvin , @xcite . in principle , these effects may be distinguished using sufficiently fast time - resolved spectroscopy , since spontaneous emission will result in fewer photons reaching the detector , whereas dephasing would result in a time dependent visibility that degrades exponentially with time .",

    "[ fig : energylevels ] , and a detailed proposal for its implementation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the enhanced exciton emission into the cavity mode is known as the purcell effect and requires small cavity volumes , so that the exciton - cavity mode coupling strength is large and the density of available photon modes is small @xcite . thus small cavities are necessary , and high purcell factors have been demonstrated experimentally in single - wavelength sized cavities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the need for small cavities is the relatively small biexciton shift , @xmath321 , which is around 1 mev . in order for a single fabry - pert resonator to accommodate modes spaced by 1 mev ( i.e. the free spectral range , fsr )",
    ", the cavity length would need to be of the order of @xmath322 m or more .",
    "this is too long for several reasons , because the purcell factor decreases with cavity length , and also because growth of such a large heterostructure would be prohibitively difficult .",
    "as a result the cavity to which we have been referring throughout this paper would need be based on a more complicated geometry than merely a pair of distributed bragg reflectors ( dbr ) forming a linear resonator .",
    "we stress that a more complex geometry is not just a requirement of this proposal , but that it would be necessary for a system even with symmetric quantum dots .",
    "if the cavity did not have separate modes near the exciton and biexciton doublet frequencies then only one transition could couple strongly to the cavity , and the other transition would be sufficiently off resonance ( @xmath323 ) that the purcell effect for that frequency would be suppressed , i.e. either the biexciton - exciton or exciton - ground transitions may be well coupled to the cavity , but not both",
    ".    it may be possible to engineer a small cavity with a pair of closely spaced modes using photonic crystals .",
    "if , during the growth of each dbr stack one layer was permitted to grow to be larger than @xmath324 , then the cavity would look more like two coupled cavities , which may have the desired split modes . certainly , geometric effects in micropillars have been shown to produce a pair of modes spaced by @xmath325 mev @xcite , though this was due to lifting polarisation degeneracy with elliptical cross - section cavities , which is undesirable for our scheme .",
    "experiments using confocal hemispherical cavities , consisting of a planar bragg reflector at the focal plane of a hemispherical reflector , of length 50 to 1000 @xmath241 m are currently underway for quantum information processing purposes @xcite . in this configuration",
    "the cavity mode waist diameter is of comparable size to the optical wavelength and coincident with a quantum dot so that the exciton - cavity mode coupling strength is reasonably large .",
    "this arrangement may provide the two requirements of the present paper : both strong coupling between the dot excitations and the cavity mode ( up to several tens of @xmath241ev ) and small fsr so that each doublet is on resonance with a nearby mode .",
    "it is quite plausible that by tuning the cavity length to vary the fsr and applying an external dc electric field to induce a stark shift in the doublet frequencies , one may bring both doublets close to cavity modes simultaneously , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , thereby realising the requirements of this proposal .",
    "we have shown analytically that using a cavity with a particular mode structure facilitates the production of polarisation entangled photon pairs from an asymmetric quantum dot , which otherwise produces photon pairs entangled in both polarisation and frequency .",
    "we demonstrated this by computing the visibility of two - photon interference fringes produced using photons generated from such a cavity - quantum dot structure , and related this to their potential to demonstrate bell - inequality violations .",

    "such phase - ignorance arises when the available time - resolution of the photon detection apparatus is longer than the asymmetry splitting , @xmath260 .",
