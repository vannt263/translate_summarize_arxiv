    "the theory of regular model sets , which are also known as cut and project sets with sufficiently nice windows , is well established ; see @xcite and references therein for general background .",
    "one cornerstone of this class is the pure pointedness of the diffraction measure @xcite .",
    "equivalently , this means that the dynamical spectrum of the uniquely ergodic hull defined by the model set is pure point as well ; compare @xcite .",
    "the regularity of the window is vital to the existing proofs such as that in @xcite , and also enters the characterisation of regular model sets via dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "for quite some time , systems such as the visible lattice points or the @xmath0th power - free integers have been known to be pure point diffractive as well @xcite .",
    "these point sets can also be described as model sets , but here the windows are no longer regular . in fact , for each of these examples , the window consists of boundary only , which has positive measure , and many other properties of regular model sets are lost , too . in particular , there are many invariant probability measures on the orbit closure ( or hull ) of the point set under the translation action of the lattice . yet , as explicit recent progress has shown , the natural cluster ( or patch ) frequency measure of this hull is ergodic and the visible points are generic for this measure @xcite .",
    "consequently , the dynamical spectrum is still pure point , by an application of the general equivalence theorem @xcite .",
    "since this example is one out of a large class with similar properties , it is natural to ask for a general approach that includes all of them .",
    "such a class is provided by _",
    "weak model sets _ , where one allows more general windows .",
    "this name was coined by moody @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.4 ) , and apparently was first looked at by schreiber @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to derive some key results for weak model sets . to this end , we begin with the visible lattice points as a motivating example .",
    "then , we start from the general setting of model sets for a general cut and project scheme @xmath1 , see eq .   below for a definition , but investigate the diffraction properties for the larger class of windows indicated above .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed possible under one fairly natural assumption , namely that of maximal or minimal density for a given van hove averaging sequence in the group @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption guarantees pure point diffractivity ( theorems  [ thm : weak - pp ] and [ thm : min - pp ] ) .    in a second step ,",
    "we analyse the ergodicity of the cluster frequency measure for the very van hove sequence , which then results in the dynamical properties of the hull we are after .",
    "in particular , we establish that weak model sets of extremal density have pure point dynamical spectrum , and calculate the latter .",
    "finally , we apply our results to coprime lattice families , which encompasses the @xmath0-visible lattice points in @xmath3-space as well as other examples of arithmetic origin , such as @xmath0-free or ( coprime ) @xmath4-free integers @xcite and their generalisations to analogous systems in number fields @xcite . this way",
    ", we demonstrate that and how the theory of weak model sets provides a natural framework for a unified treatment of such systems .    in parallel to our approach , keller and richard @xcite have developed an alternative view on model sets via a systematic exploitation of the torus parametrisation for such systems ; compare @xcite .",
    "their work includes weak model sets and provides an independent way to derive several of our key results . in this sense ,",
    "the two approaches are complementary and , in conjunction , give a more complete picture of a larger class of model sets than understood previously , both concretely and structurally .",
