    "numerical calculation of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field by choptuik @xcite and subsequent results for different matter models and symmetries ( see for example refs . ) spectacularly demonstrate that critical phenomena occur in the gravitational collapse , and that the near - critical behavior is universal in some important aspects .",
    "there are two possible late - time outcomes of gravitational collapse , distinguished by whether or not a black hole is formed in the course of evolution . which end state is realized depends on initial conditions , specified by a control parameter @xmath1 that characterizes the gravitational interaction strength in the ensuing evolution . for @xmath2 ( subcritical solution )",
    "the gravitational field is too weak to form a black hole , while for @xmath3 ( supercritical solution ) a black hole is produced .",
    "the critical solution , corresponding to a control parameter value @xmath4 just at the threshold of black hole formation , acts as an intermediate attractor for nearby initial conditions , and has an additional symmetry : discrete or continuous self - similarity , also referred to as echoing . for supercritical evolution",
    "there is usually no mass gap , and the mass of the resultant black hole is described by the mass - scaling relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is mass - scaling exponent .",
    "general gravitational collapse is a very difficult problem , even if restricted to the case of spherical symmetry . as a result ,",
    "most studies of critical behavior resort to numerical calculations at some stage , with few fully analytical solutions known . finding critical solutions",
    "is made easier by the fact that they have additional symmetry ; requiring solution to be continuously self - similar can simplify the problem enough to make it solvable for simpler matter models .",
    "both the stability of the critical solution and the exact mass - scaling exponent can then be determined by linear perturbation analysis , as suggested by evans and coleman and carried out in refs . .",
    "in this paper we consider an analytical continuously self - similar solution of gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by roberts @xcite .",
    "originally it was intended as a counter - example to cosmic censorship conjecture , but it was later rediscovered in context of the critical gravitational collapse by brady @xcite and oshiro , nakamura and tomimatsu . although this solution does exhibit critical behavior , there are two problems .",
    "first , as any self - similar solution , it is not asymptotically flat , and the mass of the black hole grows infinitely .",
    "this can be prevented if we cut the self - similar solution away from the black hole and glue it to some other solution to make the spacetime asymptotically flat and of finite mass , which was in fact done in ref . .",
    "a second , and bigger , problem is that growing non - self - similar modes will dominate the mass - scaling exponent if they exist , but they are not accounted for by the self - similar solution",
    ".    this paper addresses the second problem by doing linear perturbation analysis of the roberts solution .",
    "we calculate the mass - scaling exponent @xmath6 and analyze the stability of the critical solution .",
    "the remarkable feature of this model is that it allows exact analytical treatment .",
    "we begin by presenting a continuously self - similar spherically symmetric solution of the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field ( roberts solution ) .",
    "it is most easily derived in null coordinates .",
    "therefore we write the metric as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 can be reparametrized as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , so coordinate choice freedom is given by two functions of one variable each ; it can be fixed by setting @xmath14 at two null hypersurfaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 . with this choice of metric",
    "the einstein - scalar field equations become    [ eq : es ] @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21    the first four equations ( [ eq : es:3]-[eq : es:6 ] ) are the einstein equation for metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) , and equation ( [ eq : es:7 ] ) is the scalar wave equation @xmath22 . equations ( [ eq : es:5],[eq : es:6 ] ) are constraints .",
    "note that in the case of a massless scalar field the wave equation follows from the einstein equations , so one of the equations ( [ eq : es:3],[eq : es:4],[eq : es:7 ] ) is redundant .",
    "we turn on the influx of the scalar field at the advanced time @xmath23 , so that the spacetime is minkowskian to the past of this surface .",
    "the initial conditions for system ( [ eq : es ] ) are specified there by the continuity of the solution .",
    "we use coordinate freedom to set @xmath24 .",
    "assumption that the collapse is continuously self - similar , i.e. that there exists a vector field @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , allows the einstein - scalar equations ( [ eq : es ] ) to be solved analytically .",

    "( our choice of sign of @xmath1 is opposite to the one in @xcite .",
    "also note that the constant field term is omitted there . )",
    "the existence and position of the apparent horizon is given by condition @xmath35 , where @xmath36 due to the spherical symmetry of the problem it is possible to introduce a local mass @xmath37 by @xmath38 the mass contained inside the apparent horizon is the mass of the black hole @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the radius of apparent horizon given by equation ( [ eq : ah ] ) .",
    "we now apply the perturbation formalism .",
    "it is convenient to analyze perturbations to the self - similar solution in new variables natural to the problem . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a `` spatial '' coordinate @xmath41 and a `` scaling variable '' @xmath42 @xmath43 , \\ \\",

    "quite generally , the perturbation modes can be written as @xmath49 which amounts to doing laplace transformation on general perturbations dependent on both @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is understood that there can be many perturbation modes , with distinct @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for each ( possibly complex ) @xmath53 in the perturbation spectrum . to recover a general perturbation",
    "we must take the sum of these modes .",
    "modes with @xmath54 ( called relevant modes ) grow and eventually lead to black hole formation , while modes with @xmath55 decay and are irrelevant .",
    "let us discuss how the mass - scaling exponent @xmath6 is related to the perturbation spectrum .",
    "the function @xmath56 , defined by equation ( [ eq : ah ] ) , takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the self - similar background term .",
    "recall that @xmath56 vanishes at the apparent horizon .",
    "even thought there is no apparent horizon in critical solution , i.e. @xmath59 , the exponentially growing perturbation will eventually make @xmath56 zero , leading to black hole formation .",
    "the mode with the largest eigenvalue , @xmath60 , will clearly dominate , giving the position of the apparent horizon @xmath61 by @xmath62 here we made use of the fact that @xmath63 to the zeroth order in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the dependence of the black hole mass on @xmath1 , taken to be the control parameter , is @xmath64 this is precisely the mass - scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) with exponent @xmath65 . for a more detailed discussion of this approach and its validity see ref . .",
    "perturbing the einstein - scalar equations ( [ eq : es ] ) by a mode ( [ eq : pert ] ) , we obtain a system of linear partial differential equations .",
    "after a change of variables @xmath66 to @xmath67 , the @xmath42-dependence separates , and we are left with a following system of linear ordinary differential equations for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in the independent variable @xmath41 :    [ eq : p ] @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    here a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "boundary conditions for the system ( [ eq : p ] ) are specified at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we require that perturbations grow slower than background at large @xmath41 ( i.e. that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are bounded , and @xmath52 grows slower than @xmath41 ) for the perturbation expansion to be valid .",
    "because the solution must be continuous at the hypersurface @xmath23 , we have @xmath75 .",
    "since we used coordinate freedom in @xmath10 to set @xmath8 to zero on that surface , we also have @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions are @xmath77 equations ( [ eq : p ] ) together with boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) constitute our eigenvalue problem .    the infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath78 corresponding to the remaining coordinate freedom in @xmath11 will give rise to unphysical gauge modes @xmath79 , \\nonumber\\\\    \\delta r & = & \\frac{\\zeta(v)}{(1-v / u)^{1/2 } }      = e^{-x } \\zeta[e^{-s}(e^{2x}-1 ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\    \\delta\\phi & = & \\frac{\\zeta(v)}{(u - v ) }      = - e^{s-2x } \\zeta[e^{-s}(e^{2x}-1)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since on a @xmath23 hypersurface @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 must vanish identically , @xmath83 , so a taylor expansion of @xmath84 around zero starts from @xmath85 term .",
    "therefore these gauge modes correspond to negative eigenvalues @xmath53 , and are irrelevant .",
    "observe that there is an obvious solution of perturbation equations ( [ eq : p ] ) , which can be obtained from self - similar solution ( [ eq : ss_soln ] ) by expanding around @xmath86 @xmath87 +      \\frac{p}{2}\\ , \\frac{v^2 - 2uv}{u^2 - uv }      = x + p \\sinh 2x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , the self - similar mode has eigenvalue @xmath88 , hence any relevant mode will dominate the calculation of mass - scaling exponent .",
    "the perturbation equations ( [ eq : p ] ) inherit their structure from general einstein - scalar equations ( [ eq : es ] ) ; equations ( [ eq : p:3],[eq : p:4],[eq : p:7 ] ) are dynamical equations , while equations ( [ eq : p:5],[eq : p:6 ] ) are constraints .",
    "equation ( [ eq : p:4 ] ) is redundant @xmath89/2,\\ ] ] so it will be discarded .",
    "the simple integrable form of equation ( [ eq : p:5 ] ) allows elimination of one of the unknowns , say @xmath50 , from the other equations by @xmath90 thus we are left with two second order ode s for @xmath51 and @xmath52 :    [ eq : pe ] @xmath91 @xmath92 with boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) , and one constraint ( [ eq : p:6 ] ) , which we equivalently rewrite as first order ode with the use of equation ( [ eq : p:3 ] ) @xmath93    equations ( [ eq : pe:1],[eq : pe:2 ] ) can be separated with introduction of the auxiliary function @xmath94 , reducing to    [ eq : se ] @xmath95 @xmath96    we convert this into algebraic form using change of variable @xmath97 finally , equations ( [ eq : se ] ) and constraint ( [ eq : pe : c ] ) become    [ eq : ae ] @xmath98\\ , \\frac{dz}{dy } - ( k/2 - 1 ) z = c,\\ ] ] @xmath99\\ , \\frac{dr}{dy } - k r = c - z,\\ ] ] @xmath100 = 0,\\ ] ]    and boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) are specified at @xmath101 and @xmath102 by @xmath103 `` grow slowly '' means that @xmath104 must be bounded , and @xmath105 grows at most logarithmically , with @xmath106 bounded , as @xmath107 .",

    "their properties are well - known and described in a number of books on differential equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) , so the system ( [ eq : ae ] ) can be analytically solved and the perturbation spectrum exactly determined .",

    "any three of the functions ( [ eq : gen : z ] ) are linearly dependent with constant coefficients , for example @xmath121 functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 have the asymptotic behavior @xmath124 the case when @xmath114 is special . in this case",
    "the solution ( [ eq : gen : z ] ) degenerates and @xmath125 identically . in order to deal with this situation",
    "we continue to use @xmath126 as earlier , but denote by @xmath127 a solution independent of @xmath126 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath127 is logarithmically divergent at @xmath101 .",
    "note also that for @xmath114 we can have @xmath128 , so that the equation ( [ eq : ae:1 ] ) is inhomogeneous , and we must add the particular solution @xmath129 to the general solution above .",

    ". the solutions that satisfy the initial condition @xmath133 are @xmath134 and @xmath135 . from equation ( [ eq : hyper : connect ] ) we see that @xmath127 ( and @xmath126 ) is connected to @xmath136 , @xmath137 by a linear relation with non - zero coefficients , so the boundary conditions at infinity will only be satisfied if both @xmath136 , @xmath137 do not blow up , i.e. if @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] ; to the left of the curve @xmath142 , and to the right @xmath138 .",
    "so to satisfy all boundary conditions ( [ eq : abc ] ) , @xmath53 must lie in the shaded region @xmath143 of the complex plane , and for any @xmath144 , @xmath145 is a solution of equation ( [ eq : ae:1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ eq : abc ] )",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : ae:2 ] ) is also hypergeometric , with coefficients @xmath146 the general solution of the homogeneous equation is @xmath147 and the solution of inhomogeneous equation is easily constructed from ( [ eq : gen : r ] ) by @xmath148.\\ ] ] the limits of integration are chosen so that the boundary conditions at @xmath101 are satisfied .",
    "asymptotic ( [ eq : asympt : z ] ) and equation ( [ eq : soln : r ] ) give the behavior @xmath149 clearly , @xmath150 . also , @xmath51 is bounded at infinity since @xmath151 is , for the constraint ( [ eq : ae : c ] ) requires @xmath152 .",
