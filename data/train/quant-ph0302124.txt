    "the subject of generation of entangled states has attracted much interest since it became clear that entanglement lies at the heart of many new applications which come under the general heading of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "several methods of creating entanglement have been proposed involving trapped and cooled ions or neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is generation of entangled states in two - atom systems , since it is generally believed that entanglement of only two microscopic quantum systems ( two qubits ) is essential to implement quantum protocols such as quantum computation .",
    "it has been shown that entangled states in a two - atom system can be created by a continuous driving of the atoms with a coherent or chaotic thermal field  @xcite , or by spontaneous emission from two distant atoms initially prepared in a coherent superposition state or in an entangled state  @xcite .",
    "in particular , cabrillo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that two three - level atoms initially prepared by a weak pulse in an entangled state can evolve under spontaneous emission into an entangled state of the ground states of the atoms .",
    "the effect of spontaneous emission on entanglement creation has also been discussed by others  @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , have been limited to the small sample ( dicke ) model  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the dicke model is that it does not include the dipole - dipole interaction among the atoms and does not correspond to realistic experimental situations of atoms located ( trapped ) at different positions .",
    "in fact , the model corresponds to a very specific geometrical configuration of the atoms confined to a volume much smaller compared with the atomic resonant wavelength ( the small - sample model ) .",
    "the present atom trapping and cooling techniques can trap two atoms at distances of order of a resonant wavelength  @xcite , which makes questionable the applicability of the dicke model to physical systems .",
    "in this paper we study what may be termed `` spontaneously induced transient entanglement '' in a system of two interacting atoms . in related works , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and zhou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that a transient entanglement can be created in the dicke model driven by a thermal ( chaotic ) field .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a method to produce a transient entanglement in bose - einstein condensate excited by a single pulse .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently realised experimentally a transient entanglement in two trapped ions .",
    "unlike previous works  @xcite , we consider entanglement creation by spontaneous emission from _ initially uncorrelated _ atoms and without the presence of external coherent or incoherent fields .",
    "we are particularly interested in three aspects of entanglement creation by spontaneous emission : ( 1 ) the dependence of the entanglement creation on specific arrangements of initial uncorrelated states , ( 2 ) the role of the antisymmetric state in the entanglement creation , and ( 3 ) sharing and transfer of entanglement between two entangled states .",
    "we do not make the small - sample approximation , so that our results are valid for arbitrary interatomic separations .",
    "the antisymmetric state and its dynamics are not neglected , even when dealing with small interatomic separations .",
    "we show that spontaneous emission from two spatially separated atoms can lead to a transient entanglement of initially unentangled atoms .",
    "this result contrasts the dicke model where spontaneous emission can not produce entanglement from initially unentangled atoms  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "we show that the entanglement creation relies crucially on the population distribution between the entangled symmetric and antisymmetric states and attains maximal values when the population of the symmetric state becomes zero .",
    "this is a rather surprising prediction , since the symmetric state is an example of maximally entangled state and one might conclude that its participation in the atomic dynamics would enhance entanglement .",
    "we consider a system of two non - overlapping two - level atoms with ground states @xmath0 and excited states @xmath1 connected by dipole transition moments @xmath2 .",
    "the atoms are located at fixed positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 and coupled to all modes of the electromagnetic field , which we assume are in the vacuum state .",
    "we consider spontaneous emission from identical as well as non - identical atoms prepared in two different initial states . in the case of nonidentical atoms",

    "[ fg6 ] that the entanglement decays with the reduced rate @xmath125 corresponding to the decay rate of the population of the antisymmetric state , and the coherent coupling does not transfer much of the entanglement to the symmetric state .",
    "our calculations clearly demonstrate that the transient entanglement induced from initially unentangled atoms depends crucially on the presence of the antisymmetric state , that is characteristic of spatially extended atomic systems .",

    "the results show that the generation of the entanglement is strongly dependent upon the population distribution between the symmetric and antisymmetric states of the system .",

    "we have found that the entanglement can be enhanced by the process of the coherent transfer of the population between the symmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the entanglement can decay with two different time scales and exhibits a revival behavior due to the coherent transfer of the population from the rapidly decaying symmetric to the slowly decaying antisymmetric state before it decays to zero .",
