    "with increase in energies of accelerators , accurate data on high - multiplicity events at high energies have recently been provided .",
    "this makes it possible to analyze correlations and fluctuations such as the bose - einstein correlations ( bec)@xcite and the intermittency @xcite in detail .",
    "these correlations and fluctuations of produced particles are rather new tools to study multiparticle production . by analyzing them ,",
    "one may be able to extract useful information on the space - time size of the particle production region and the production mechanism@xcite .",
    "correlations and fluctuations may also provide a clear signal of quark gluon plasma formation expected in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "multiparticle production is a phenomenon observed commonly in various reactions such as @xmath0 annihilations , lepton - hadron deep inelastic interactions , hadron - hadron interactions , and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "a large amount of correlation data has been accumulated on various reactions .",
    "it has been found that there are some universal characteristics which are independent of the reaction type while some other properties depend on it .",
    "phenomenological models which can describe some crucial properties of many particle correlations will be very useful for systematic investigations of those characteristics caused by correlations and fluctuations .",
    "the bec have lately attracted considerable attention , in particular , because they may give information on the space time structure of hadronic source and they may cause large fluctuations of particle density in the phase space . although many existing phenomenological models have not taken into account the bec completely yet , there are some models ( or event generators ) which allow computing the two identical particle correlation functions . in most cases ,",
    "the bec are generated more or less artificially .",
    "for example , they are calculated by using ( i ) the fourier transformation of the model s source function@xcite or ( ii ) the wigner function@xcite , ( iii ) by weighting every event@xcite , or ( iv ) by modifying the distribution of momentum difference of identical particle pairs in each event@xcite .",
    "however , some of those models can not describe the bec in a single event .",
    "motivated by those consideration , we would like to propose a new statistical model .",
    "it is constructed by the maximum entropy method @xcite and two versions of the model , the @xmath3-model and the @xmath2-model are applied to @xmath0 annihilation in this paper .",
    "the most characteristic point of our model is that the bec is taken into account in quantum statistical level with a characteristic correlation length ( @xmath1 ) defined in the rapidity space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.i@xmath4i ,",
    "our model is explained and the distribution functions of the final state hadrons are derived .",
    "sec.i@xmath4i@xmath4i is devoted to the explanation of the simulation method including the procedure of parameter determination .",
    "comparison of results obtained from simulation with the experimental data from petra to lep energies is given in sec.i@xmath4v .",

    "we first consider the @xmath3-model , i.e. , we assume that only pions are produced according to a statistical distribution .",
    "a system consisting of many pions produced in a single event may be decomposed into three subsystems , which consist of like sign pions , that is , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 subsystems .",
    "for example , consider a @xmath8 subsystem in the longitudinal phase space with limited transverse momentum@xcite .",
    "the longitudinal axis may be identified with the direction of the initial quark and antiquark produced by the virtual photon in center of mass system . then the rapidity space in the longitudinal phase space",
    "is divided into many cells @xcite of equal size @xmath1 , and we consider a probability to find @xmath8 mesons in each cell .",

    "i_-th cell ,  @xmath10 is normalized as @xmath11 the summation index @xmath9 runs from 0 to infinity because of the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the mean @xmath8 multiplicity and the mean energy of the @xmath8 subsystem are given , respectively , by : @xmath12 and @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the energy of a @xmath8 in the _",

    "the same argument applies to both @xmath20 and @xmath21 subsystems .",
    "therefore the mean multiplicities and the mean energies of those subsystems are given as @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean charged multiplicity .",
    "the most probable distribution @xmath10 for the @xmath8 subsystem can be determined by the maximum entropy method which is well - known in information theory@xcite . according to a statistical picture",
    ", particles will distribute in the phase space in such a way that every possible state is realized with the same probability .",
    "this method has been applied in many fields in science including multiparticle production phenomenology .",
    "first , we define the missing information entropy @xcite : @xmath25 this @xmath26 has the maximum value when @xmath10 is a constant , so - called equal _ a priori _  probabilities , which does not depend on @xmath27 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is noted here that the probability @xmath10 does not depend on @xmath28 when ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath1 is determined by fitting to data on the second order fluctuations of multiplicity . in order to study the resonance effect , we also consider another extreme case called @xmath2-model where it is assumed that only @xmath2 mesons are produced in the same way as pions in the @xmath3-model . in the @xmath2-model",
