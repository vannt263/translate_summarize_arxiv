    "all techincal plasmas , i.e. low - temperature partially ionized plasmas used in the industry for technological purposes such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) , etching , etc .",
    ", are intrinsically bound plasmas generated in corresponding plasma reactors . unlike in magnetic fusion plasma reactors , where plasma is too hot to be allowed a contact with the reactor walls without significant consequences and thus where strong magnetic fields are used to confine such plasmas , in technical plasmas a direct contact with the reactor electrodes or walls is very common . in the latter case the electrons , having much greater mobilities compared to that of ions , tend to leave to the metal walls forming a positively charged sheath due to the ions .",
    "this process continues until the potential corresponding to the space charge in the sheaths , which accelerates the ions and deccelerates the electrons , eventually balances the electron and ion fluxes .",
    "furthermore , the direct contact of plasma with the substrate to be processed is often essential , e.g. , in etching , where ions emanating from the bulk plasma gain energy and directed momentum in passing the sheath region and hit the substrate .",
    "these ion directed momentum and energy are vital for creating large - aspect structures on the substrate . the ion flux to substrate plays also a significant role since it determines rate of the surface processes which occur under the ion bombardment . for a weakly collisional sheath ,",
    "the ion flux is proportional to the plasma density at the plasma bulk - sheath interface , which is proportional to the power deposition rate for high neutral gas pressure ( in case of the low pressure energy transport is non - local and this dependence is more complex ) . indeed , to sustain technical plasmas",
    ", one needs to couple energy to it , which usually occurs through electromagnetic fields of different frequencies .",
    "for the densities and the field magntidues common to the technical plasmas , energy is coupled predominantly to the electrons .",
    "thiis is due to the much smaller electron mass in comparison to that of the background neutrals , which results in extremely slow energy exchange between the electrons and the neutral gas , so that electron temperatures reach values more than hundred times higher that ion temperatures in the stationary discharges .",
    "in contrast , ions and neutrals have comparable masses and any ion kinetic energy surplus is very efficiently transferred to the background neutral gas , so that the ions end up having practically room temperature .",
    "the hot electrons ionize the neutrals either through direct impact ionization or through indirect ionization channels , i.e. excitation of metastable atoms or molecules followed by penning ionization .",
    "therefore , plasma density is proportional to the reaction rates of such reactions , the reaction rates depend on the electron temperature , and the electron temperature is affected by the power absorbed by the electrons .    as the lorentz force caused by the magnetic field does not perform any work on the charged particles , only electric field can heat plasma . in order to deposit electric energy into plasma ,",
    "one first has to excite a certain pattern of electromagnetic fields called mode , which is governed simultaneously by the maxwells equations , plasma characteristics and the boundary conditions , including the excitation source .",
    "the electromagnetic mode can either exhibit fields with large intensity in the plasma bulk or fields more concentrated at the periphery of the discharge , such as sheath - bulk plasma interface .",
    "hence , the former are called body ( or global ) modes and the latter surface waves , respectively .",
    "once excited , such a mode will dissipate its electromagnetic energy to the plasma particles through various processes .",
    "common to the technical plasmas are the collisional mode damping due to electron - neutral elastic collisions and collisionless landau damping .",
    "the collisional damping trasforms the energy of the ordered particle motion under influence of the electromagnetic forces caused by the mode fields into chaotic thermal motion through charged - neutral particle collisions in case of low charged particle densities or through coulomb collisions otherwise .",
    "landau damping occurs through resonant wave - particle interaction whereby the electromagnetic wave affects mainly the particles trapped in the potential well of the mode by accelerating the particles with velocities smaller and deccelerating the particles with velocities bigger than the mode phase velocity .",
    "if the particle velocity distribution function features negative slope at the mode phase velocity , the mode accelerates more particles than it deccelerates and the effective energy transfer occurs from the mode to the particles .    for the industrial plasma processing",
    ", it is often important to ensure uniformity of the ion fluxes and ion energy distribution throughout the part of the discharge which is relevant to the processing . following the argumentation above , the uniformity of the ion fluxes depends on plasma density , which is influenced by the absorbed power profile ( which in turn depends on the distribution of electromagnetic fields in a mode and a specific dissipation process ) , and energy transport ( which may be local in case of high collisionality and non - local if the effective mean free path for an energy changing collision is larger than characteristic reactor dimensions ) .",
    "the uniformity of the characteristic energy of ions impinging on the substrate is directly affected by uniformity of the dc voltage across the sheath ( or uniformity of the dc plasma potential and the dc voltage on the substrate ) .",
    "therefore , it is important for description of technical plasmas to understand structure of the main electromagnetic modes existing in the corresponding reactors , their dissipation , and distribution of the voltage in the plasma sheath .",
    "the simplest technical plasmas are unmagnetized . in this case",
    ", the cold collisionless plasma dispersion relation for an unbounded plasma allows propagation of a longitudinal mode ( so that electric field polarization is aligned with the direction of wave propagation ) with dispersion relation @xmath0 and a transversal mode ( with the electric field polarization perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation ) with dispersion relation @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in this approximation no body modes are allowed to propagate with frequencies below the electron plasma frequency ( therefore , it is called cutoff frequency ) . any wave driven at frequency below the cutoff frequency",
    "will be evanescent ( heavily damped ) .",
    "two different approaches to excitation of the electromagnetic modes ( or coupling of the electromagnetic fields from external sources to plasma ) by a time - dependent source can be considered for the technical unmagnetized plasmas , which differ by the orientation of the dominant electric field with respect to the plasma surface . for the capacitive ( inductive ) coupling electric field",
    "is perpendicular ( parallel ) to the plasma surface , respectively .",
    "the perpendicular electric field in a capacitively coupled plasma discharge decays into the plasma on a distance of the order of the debye length to a small value needed to sustain the ohmic current ensuring the current continuity .",
    "however , the maxwell s equations require that the parallel magnetic field generated by the time - changing perpendicular electric field must decay into the plasma on a distance of order of the inertial skin depth @xmath2 , and the decaying magnetic field generates a parallell electric field .",
    "thus , there is no solution with a purely perpendicular electric field , there is always a radial component of the electric field which is small under normal conditions in a capacitively coupled discharge . as will be demonstrated below , in the cold plasma approximation a capacitively coupled discharge support two different dominant modes when an analytical treatment takes into account the bounded nature of such a discharge , calculating the fields in each of the separate discharge regions ( plasma sheaths and bulk ) respecting the boundary conditions and matching the solutions on the interfaces between the different regions .",
    "these are normal modes of plasma filled cavity representing a capacitively coupled reactor .",
    "these modes differ by their symmetry of the perpendicular electric field with respect to the discharge midplane ( and hence are called `` even '' and `` odd '' modes ) and lead to different physical consequences . if @xmath3 or its collisional analog ( in case of the collision dominated skin effect ) @xmath4 are smaller than the bulk plasma width @xmath5 , the fields tend to be concentrated around the sheath - bulk plasma interface .",
    "therefore , these modes in a capacitively coupled discharge consist of surface waves . if the mode wavelengths ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the even and odd modes , respectively . here",
    "@xmath8 is the vacuum wavelength for the frequency @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) become comparable to the electrode radius @xmath11 , the wave nature of the modes start to manifest itself through the nonuniform distribution of the discharge voltage ( `` standing wave effect '' ) or plasma potential ( `` telegraph effect '' ) in the radial direction .",
    "it will be shown below that a strong skin effect can lead to a redistribution of the fields inside a mode , making the fields stronger towards the discharge edge .",
    "the action of the skin effect is akin to that observed in metals conducting a radio - frequency ( rf ) current , where the skin effect leads to generation of eddy currents reducing the original current in the bulk of the conductor and increasing it at the periphery of the conductor , so that effectively the rf current tends to be concentrated close to the periphery of the discharge .",
    "likewise , plasma in a cylindrical capacitively coupled reactor the even mode shows increase of the dominant axial current towards the edge and the odd mode shows increase of the dominant radial current towards the plasma sheaths . nevertheless , the field symmetry remains unchanged even when strong skin effect is present , so that classification of the modes remain the same .",
    "it is important to note that these modes are so - called slow modes , i.e. their phase velocity is smaller than the speed of light and thus they can be dissipated not only through collisions but also through the collisionless landau damping .",
    "usually , in the capacitively coupled discharges @xmath3 is large compared to the plasma bulk size , thus the magnetic field hardly changes in the plasma and the parallel electric field is negligible , and @xmath12 so that the wave nature of the modes is hardly noticeable . in this case",
    "one can adequately describe the modes using an electrostatic approximation , which uses solely poisson equation to solve for the electric field .",
    "the discharge voltage at the driven electrode and the plasma potential are both uniform in the radial direction .",
    "however , there is a growing trend to increase the substrate size and driving frequency of such discharges in order to increase the processing throughput . in the light of the above arguments , under these circumstances",
    "the field pattern might change considerably and lead to large nonuniformities in the power depositions and sheath voltage drops .",
    "furthermore , a strong skin effect ( when @xmath13 is small because of the higher plasma densities ) can lead to a change in the type of the power deposition , changing it from capacitive type when the perpendicular electric field dominates to the inductive type , when the radial electric field dominates .",
    "this demands an electromagnetic description despite the vacuum wavelength corresponding to the driving frequency is commonly greater than the reactor dimensions .",
    "the inductively coupled discharges ( icps ) use predominantly parallel electric field for power deposition into the plasma . as the radial electric field for the overdense plasmas , which is normally the case , decays into the plasma with the skin - effect",
    ", the power absorption can be more or less uniform ( when the skin depth is large compared to the interelectrode gap ) or strongly localized otherwise . in principle , as the plasma is usually overdense , such system supports similar modes to the capacitively coupled discharges . as the large parallel electric in the inductively coupled discharges field penetrates plasma much deeper than the perpendicular electric field in the capacitively coupled discharge in their normal regimes of operation ,",
    "energy coupling is more efficient in case of the inductively coupled discharges , which leads to higher plasma densities attained in such discharges . as in",
    "capacitively coupled discharges which exhibit transit to the inductively coupled regime under extreme conditions , the inductively coupled discharges can be also operated in the capacitively coupled regime .",
    "if the magnetic field is used in the discharge , the magnetized plasma dispersion relation allows propagation of the body helicon modes with frequencies well below electron plasma frequency .",
    "since these modes are global , they allow more effective and uniform energy coupling between antenna and plasma .",
    "whereas the electromagnetic effects are well described for the plasma sources whose operation depends on those very effects ( e.g. , see textbooks @xcite and @xcite ) , it has been only relatively recently realized that the electromagnetic effects become significant for the modern capacitively coupled discharges with large area electrodes driven by high frequency sources . here",
    ", the attention will be paid mostly to description of the electromagnetic effects for the modes in a capacively coupled reactor .",
    "many physical insights can be obtained by considering a simple cylindrical cavity representing capactiviely coupled reactors filled with plasma modelled as a dielectric using the cold homogeneous unmagnetized plasma model , the plasma being separated from the electrodes by sheaths . in description of such a model we will mostly follow @xcite .",
    "a capacitively coupled reactor usually consists of two planar electrodes , of which at least one is driven by an external ac source , the driving frequency being in the range of rf frequencies .",
    "most of the voltage drop takes place in the positively charged sheaths , which separate bulk quasineutral plasma from the electrodes . for the lateral confinement a sidewall made of metal or dielectric material",
    "is usually used .",
    "a typical ccp reactor with cylindrical geometry is depicted in fig .",
    "since the skin depth in metal for rf frequencies is much smaller than the electrode thickness , the supplied voltage propagates first in the form of a tem mode in the waveguide formed by the back side of the driven electrode and the grounded encasing from the point of application of the external source to the slit at the radial periphery of the reactor ( denoted st in the figure ) , at which point electromagnetic waves supplying power for sustaining the plasma enter the reactor and carry the energy further in the discharge in the form of the modes supported by such configuration from the radial periphery to the radial center of the discharge .",
    "note that the ccp reactor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has asymmetric configuration , i.e. the total area of the grounded surfaces is larger than the driven electrode area .",
    "such a configuration is more general than a symmetric one as it allows excitation of the both main modes supported by the ccp reactors with plasma , as will be shown shortly .    without plasma ,",
    "such reactor is a simple capacitor , which for the usual frequencies and sizes support only tem modes propagating with the speed of light , as these modes have no cutoff frequency from below .",
    "the first available tm mode in such a waveguide can not propagate for @xmath14 with @xmath15 the interelectrode distance and @xmath16 the vacuum wavelength @xcite .",
    "a presence of plasma dramatically changes the modes supported by a capacitively coupled reactor .",
    "the electrode inductance for the radial currents flowing through the electrodes is not altered by the plasma , but the capacitance increases by a factor of @xmath17 compared to the vacuum case because plasma virtually screens the fields from it , hence the capacitance is determined by the sheaths only . the mode becomes a slow wave , its phase velocity @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 the radial wave vector ) being significantly smaller than the speed of light owing to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effective radial wavelength of such a mode @xmath21 is much smaller than wavelength of the vacuum tem modes @xmath22 and can become comparable to the reactor radius ( so that the mode s wave nature leads to signficant nonuniformities ) at much smaller frequency than expected from an estimate based on the vacuum tem modes .    to analyze such model a convenient choice ( e.g. , @xcite ) is to represent the plasma by a uniform ion background and electrons as a central lossy dielectric slab with permittivity equal to that of a cold collisional plasma , @xmath23 with @xmath24 the frequency of electron - neutral elastic collisions and @xmath25 the plasma density where electron density @xmath26 is assumed homogeneous .",
    "the central electron slab has the same density as that of the ion background , so that the bulk plasma slab is quasineutral and the matrix sheaths are positively charged . as has been argued in the appendix  a of @xcite , linear small amplitude oscillations of the electron negatively charged slab around its stationary position can be adequately described by a stationary dielectric slab because the charge perturbation resulting from the slab motion is mimicked by the harmonic charges occuring at the sheath - dielectric interface in order to satisfy boundary condition for the perpendicular electric flux density .",
    "all sheaths have uniform thickness @xmath27 .",
    "although such a model is clearly not self - consistent and does not account for many potentially significant effects such as , among others , non - uniform plasma profile , finite temperature effects , nonlinear sheath oscillations , and nonuniform sheath thickness , it provides basic ideas about the modes which are supported by a ccp reactor .",
    "futher , we will assume the field pattern of a tm mode ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. the electric field with the radial and axial components and the magnetic field with the azimuthal component .",
    "assuming the azimuthal symmetry , all the fields depend only on the radial and the axial coordinates .",
    "as discussed above , there is always a radial component of the electric field because the maxwell s equations predict decay of the magnetic field into the plasma and a spatially changing magnetic field is accompanied by a radial electric field component .",
    "however , when the driving frequency and electrode radius of a ccp reactor are sufficiently small so that the nonuniformity of the fields is insignificant ( which had been usually the case up to relatively recently ) , the radial electric field is negligibly small compared to the axial field , some authors prefer to call such modes quasi - tem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the modes with the te - like field pattern have phase velocities greater than the speed of light so that their wavelengths are much bigger than those of the tm - like modes , thus the te - like modes are not considered here .",
    "following the ansatz , the ampere s and faraday s laws can be reduced to a single equation for the azimuthal component of the magnetic field .",
    "when written in the sheaths and bulk plasma separately , it reads @xmath28   + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial h_{\\phi}}{\\partial z } + k_0 ^ 2 h_\\phi = 0 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 in the sheaths and @xmath30 in the bulk plasma and @xmath31 .",
    "this equation has to be solved under boundary condition of vanishing tangential electric field at the metal electrodes , which translates to @xmath32 according to the ampere s law .",
    "then , assuming that all fields change in time harmonically with frequency @xmath9 and solving this equation for @xmath33 using the method of separation of variables along with calculating the axial and the radial electric field components from the ampere s law yields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the bulk plasma ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 and for the sheath plasma @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are zeroth and first order bessel functions of the first kind representing the standing waves formed by the counterpropagating surface wave modes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are mode amplitudes , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are complex wavevectors coupled by @xmath44 and @xmath45 resulting from substitution of eqs .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "all the modes are classified by their symmetry of @xmath33 ( or of @xmath46 , which has the same symmetry ) with respect to @xmath47 ( the even and odd modes being denoted with the superscript e and o , respectively ) and by their axial mode number @xmath48 .",
    "it will be demonstrated shortly that the @xmath49 modes are dominant and the tonks - dattner - like surface modes with @xmath50 are damped heavily in the radial direction and are non - negligible only close to the lateral sidewalls , where they are needed to satisfy boundary conditions and cause strong local field nonuniformities @xcite .",

    "the axial electric flux density @xmath52 must be continuous there .",
    "it is worth noting that the continuity of the axial electric flux density at the interface between the sheaths and the bulk plasma also means discontinuity of the axial electric field there , which points out at the accumulation of surface charge . as has been mentioned above ( see also @xcite ) , this surface charge mimicks charge perturbation due to the electron plasma slab motion in a more realistic treatment .",

    "this means that in the framework of the electrostatic analysis the electrostatic field with the even symmetry ( not that such modes are the only modes existing in a geometrically symmetric reactor ) , driven by a power source at a frequency below the electron series resonance , is distributed not in the form of the electrostatic analog of the even surface wave mode , but according to the trivial soluition predicting uniform voltage distribution over the driven electrode ( such field pattern is a very popular assumption in modelling the ccp discharges .",

    "therefore , there is a knee around the elecron series resonance frequency in the long wavelength part of both electrostatic and electromagnetic dispersion relations for the first even surface mode ( see fig .  3 ) . in the electrostatic approximation",

    "one can however see the transition of the smooth dispersion relation in the em case to the sharp knee in the electrostatic dispersion relation if one gradually increases the speed of light ( see fig .",

    "another situation where the electromagnetic treatment can be important is when plasma density is so large , that the skin width becomes comparable to the interelectrode gap . in this case",
    "the field nonuniformities can lead to significant redistribution of the current and power deposition even when the radial size of a reactor is small compared to the wavelength of the first even or odd modes @xcite .",

    "one can also observe that the electromagnetic and electrostatic dispersion relations for first even and odd modes approach each other in the short radial wavelength limit .",
    "it can be concluded that in this limit , the corresponding modes become virtually electrostatic , which is born out by estimation of the electromagnetic and electrostatic energy content for the corresponding modes @xcite .      the first even mode ( @xmath49 ) is usually excited in the long radial wavelength part of the corresponding dispersion relation ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "the corresponding elecromagnetic waves propagate from the radial edge , where they are excited , towards the radial center .",

    "however , in the literature only the standing wave caused by the counterpropagating first even modes is called the standing wave effect @xcite , @xcite",
    ". this can be in part justified by the frequently observed stronger damping of the first odd surface wave mode propagating to the radial center from the radial edge compared to that of the first even mode , so that there is virtually no counterpropagating wave and thus technically no standing wave .",

    "the different axial electric field @xmath46 symmetries with respect to @xmath47 of the first even and odd standing wave modes cause different physics effects .",
    "the `` the standing wave effect '' consists in the first even mode ( with @xmath153 ) causing radial variations of the sheath voltages , which are symmetric in the both sheaths .",
    "the field symmetry of this mode is the same as that of the tem mode excited in a ccp reactor representing a vacuum capacitor in the abscence of plasma @xcite .",

    "there are induced radial currents propagating in the opposite directions at the top and bottom sheath - bulk plasma interfaces , so that this mode generates no net radial current .",
    "the first odd mode , in contrast , has @xmath155 and leads to the radial variations in the sheath voltage , which are also antisymmetric in the driven and grounded sheaths .",
    "the field symmetry of this mode is the same as that of the tem mode excited in a coaxial cable ( or a stripline waveguide ) represented by a ccp reactor with high - conductivity plasma slab as the central conductor @xcite .",

    "this mode carries the rf plasma potential perturbation from the radial edge , provided it was excited there , in the direction of the radial center . due to the symmetry of the mode",
    ", it can be excited only in an asymmetric ccp reactor by the perturbation of the plasma potential from its symmetric value arising due to the unequal capacitive division of the sheath voltages owing to the larger grounded sheath area compared to the area of the driven sheath at the discharge radial edge . in this way , the first odd mode leads to increase of the rf voltage amplitude on the driven electrode and to its decrease on the grounded electrode , respectively .",
    "the equations describing radial propagation of the plasma potential perturbation resemble those for the attenuated signal propagation in a lossy transmission line , hence the first odd mode and the radial uniformities connected with it were dubbed telegraph effect @xcite .",

    "the first odd ( sometimes also called telegraph ) mode might also dramatically affect the self - bias of the driven conducting electrode connected via a blocking capacitor to a power source @xcite .    as has been discussed previously ,",
    "the skin effect comes into play when plasma densities are sufficiently high so that the skin depth becomes comparable to the electrode gap . in this case",
    "the induced radial electric field becomes large , tends to be concentrated at the sheath - bulk plasma interfaces and drives large radial currents there , which lead to screening of the axial electric and azimuthal magnetic fields from the radial center of the plasma towards its radial edge for the even mode .",

    "it should be noted that although the skin effect changes the field pattern of the mode , it does not change field symmetries , so that the mode identities are not altered by the skin effect .",

    "in this regime the radial electric field is dominant and along with the power absorption profile shows typical pattern of the skin effect , growing from the radial center towards the radial edge . if the case of low pressure the e - h heating regime with increasing power occurs globally , in the case of high pressure the heating regime change is local and , quite surprisingly , can occur in different directions at several radial locations .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows results of the self - consistent transmission line model described above for ccp discharges driven in argon by rf voltage at 200 mhz and 150 mtorr neutral gas pressure with several central rf voltage amplitudes @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see the transition from e to h heating regime and back occuring at several radial locations .",
    "the corresponding electron density profiles show the standing wave signature of the fall from the radial center in the radial direction for the low power case ( @xmath205 v ) where the capacitive heating regime dominates , but tend to have the skin effect signature of increase outwards from the center for higher powers , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the change in power absorption profile caused by the first odd mode ( the telegraph effect ) shows dramatically different pattern from that caused by the first even mode ( the standing wave effect ) .",
    "owing to the symmetry of the odd mode the sheath voltage of the sheath adjacent to the driven electrode is increased and the sheath voltage of the sheath adjacent to the grounded electrode tends to be decreased by the same amount .",
    "it follows that while the power deposited in each of the individual sheath may be quite different from each other , but the total power is hardly changed @xcite .",
    "this might still add to the power deposition nonuniformity issue in the case of local power deposition ( high pressure ) .",
    "another issue important for the plasma processing is the radial uniformity of the peak ion energy for the ions hitting the surfaces in a ccp reactor .",
    "this issue has been thoroughly investigated in @xcite .",
    "although it might seem that the first even and odd electromagnetic modes excited in a ccp reactor should lead to the radial nonuniformity of the dc part of the plasma potential just as they do for its amplitude due to the standing wave and the telegraph effects , but this is normally not the case due to the high bulk plasma conductivity and small dc currents which flow through the bulk plasma . from the expression for @xmath136 in the collisional case",
    "one can easily see that @xmath136 goes to infinity as the driving frequency vanishes , which means that for the dc perturbations plasma potential must remain uniform .    as it was concluded in @xcite ,",
    "the uniformity of the ion peak energy ( which is approximately equal to the dc component of the corresponding sheath voltage ) strongly depends on the discharge set - up .",
    "whereas the sheath voltage can be uniform if the sheath touches the conducting electrode adjacent to it ( in this case the electrode is held at a single dc potential due to its high conductivity and the sheath voltage is also radially uniform ) , this ceases to be the case on a dielectric substrate .",
    "the dc sheath voltage saturates at the self - rectifying value , which is needed to ensure that period - averaged electron and ion currents are equal so the currents are ambipolar @xcite . in case of the conducting electrode such self - rectifying value",
    "is attained in a global sense , so that the total dc ion and electron currents flowing through the electrode match each other despite the local currents are nonambipolar ( because of the electromagnetic effects the particle fluxes are nonuniform , while the sheah voltage must be uniform .",
    "this means that the current ambipolarity can be achieved only globally and will inevitably be violated locally ) .",
    "the locally nonambipolar currents will then be short - circuited on the electrode surface , which generates corresponding dc currents in the electrode . in the case",
    "dielectric substrate the ambipolarity of currents will be achieved locally and the corresponding self - rectifying sheath voltage will thus be radially nonuniform , which might be detrimental for plasma processing . in the case of the conducting electrodes ,",
    "it was also found in @xcite that the self - bias of the driven electrode can be strongly changed by the telegraph effect compared to value expected from the electrostatic theory .",
    "since the self - rectifying sheath voltage is regulated approximately by the largest rf amplitude in the sheath potential of the driven electrode increases towards the radial edge due to the telegraph effect , its dc sheath voltage must increase accordingly .",
    "this can only by achieved if the driven electrode has a negative self - bias .",
    "since the processing plasmas are required to be as uniform as possible and all the electromagnetic effects occuring in reactors with large electrodes driven by very high frequencies described above lead to noniformities either in the ion fluxes to the substrate or the average energy of their directed motion to the substrate , it is a very interesting and important question of how to remove or alleviate such nonuniformities , which is discussed in this section .",
    "note that alternative concepts of high density plasma production in ccp reactors without large area electrodes and/or vhf driving sources are not considered here .    because the standing wave and the skin effect lead to different radial power deposition profiles",
    ", one can assume that they can compensate each other under certain conditions .",
    "for example , this can be seen in fig .  13 in @xcite .",
    "however , such a compensation is hard to control and it does not solve the issue of the sheath potential nonuniformity .    in @xcite an elegant and efficient solution to ensure the uniformity of the axial field was suggested .",
    "the maxwell s equations do not allow a solution with purely axial field , they require a radial electric field component . assuming such a solution , one can ask if it is possible to generate such a solution by a non - flat , shaped electrode .",
    "the resulting electric field must satisfy the boundary conditions at each point of the electrode surface , which require that the tangential electric field vanishes so that the electric field is normal at each point of the electrode surface .",
    "thus , by enforcing the electrode surface to be perpendicular to the field solution at each point , one can calculate the shape electrode , which turns out to be gaussian @xcite .",
    "the plasma was to be confined by a dielectric slab and was assumed not to influence the final solution .",
    "later analysis ( @xcite , @xcite ) has demonstrated this to be the case indeed and generalized the method of calculating the electrode shape for the rectangular ccp discharges .",
    "such an approach tackles both the uniformity of the absorbed power and the sheath voltage issues .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the authors suggest two approaches to improve uniformity of the high - frequency , large - electrode - area ccp discharges , which also consist in modifications of the driven electrode .",
    "the first approache consists in using graded conductivity electrodes ( gce ) , i.e. to cover the driven electrode with a dielectic layer with conductivity decreasing from edge to the center . as the rf wave propagates inwards from the edge of the electrode , the penetration of the hf field into the dielectric increases .",
    "this increasing penetration counteracts the increase in the electric field resulting from the standing wave effect , and hence improves the uniformity of the resulting plasma .",
    "the second approach is to segment the driven electrode into separate sections and supply power to all the sections ensuring the same phase or a constant phase shift between adjacent sections .",
    "the both approaches seem to yield a noticeable improvement in the uniformity of the ion fluxes , but only modes improvement in the uniformity of the sheath voltages influencing the iedf .",
    "the nonuniformities connected with the telegraph mode could be avoided by using symmetric ccp reactors @xcite , in which such a mode is not excited .",
    "as the plasma processing industry goes in the direction of ever increasing electrode area and driving frequency , the amount of corresponding experimental data is huge .",
    "since a comprehensive review of such experimental activities goes beyond focus of the present entry , only a few experiments are mentioned here .",
    "one of the first direct experimental evidences of the electromagnetic effects causing nonuniformities of the ion fluxes was obtained through ion flux cartography in @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . here",
    ", the ion flux cartography technique was used to measure the ion fluxes impinging on the electrode surface by utilizing a 8 x 8 matrix of electrostatic negatively biased probes inserted into the grounded electrode .",
    "the discharge was produced in argon gas at 150 mtorr pressure between two large - area square plates 40 cm x 40 cm separated by a distance of 4.5 cm , surrounded laterally by a 4 cm thick teflon barrier .",
    "the measurements were conducted for the same nominal power of 50 w at different driving frequencies . because of the relatively high pressure , the energy transport is local and the nonuniformity of the ion fluxes , which is a direct consequence of the nonuniform plasma density , is in this case connected with the nonuniformity of the power absorption .",
    "one can see that the ion flux is practically uniform for the frequency of 13,56 mhz , and it acquires a typical signature of the standing wave effect manifesting itself in the ion flux intensity falling off from the discharge center to its edge .",
    "further , nonuniformity of the discharge voltage due to the standing wave effect in a large area ccp discharge driven by a high frequency source was demonstrated in @xcite in the absence of plasma .",
    "the nonuniformity of the plasma density due to the standing wave effect was experimentally revealed in @xcite .",
    "the suppression of nonuniformities caused by the standing wave effect through use of the segmented electrodes with @xmath206 phase shift between the neighbor segments was checked experimentally in @xcite with modest success .",
    "the suppression of the standing wave effect due to the gaussian lens electrode ( see the previous section ) was shown experimentally in @xcite by ion flux cartography and measuring the plasma optical emission intensity .",
    "[ fig9 ] taken from that work demonstrates that use of the gaussian lens electrode designed for the appropriate driving frequency indeed leads to flattening of the ion flux radial profile .",
    "an experimental observation of the induced radial electric field causing the skin effect in a ccp discharge was made in @xcite . for large densities ,",
    "the inductive h heating mode was detected , with the absorbed power profile increasing from the center to the the radial edge , a signature characteristic of the skin effect .",
    "the telegraph effect occuring in asymmetric ccp reactors leads to a radially nonuniform plasma potential , which is due to the first odd mode generating antisymmetric perturbations in the ground and driven sheath voltages .",
    "the nonuniformity of the plasma potential was demonstrated in @xcite , the asymmetric perturbations of the sheath voltages were observed indirectly through monitoring thickness of the films deposited on the grounded and driven electrodes in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "6 therein ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the telegraph mode can cause redistribution of the currents at the electrodes as a result of the self - rectification of the sheaths .",
    "if electrodes in a ccp reactor are exposed to plasma , the dc component of the sheath voltages , which determines the average energy with which ions hit the electrode surfaces , is radially uniform ( owing to uniformity of the dc plasma potential and dc potential of the electrodes because of their high conductivity ) , which was experimentally corroborated in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dc currents flowing radially in the electrodes to compensate for the nonuniform particle currents hitting the electrodes as a result of the sheath self - rectification with the nonuniform voltages due to the standing wave and the telegraph effects generating nonambipolar currents were directly measured in @xcite . another possible consequence of the telegraph effect when there is a delectric substrate covering an electrode is that the surface charge and potential of the dielectric substrate can be negative and not only positive as for a uniform rf plasma potential , which was shown in @xcite ."
