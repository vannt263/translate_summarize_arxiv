    "a very significant development in the construction of constant dimension subspace codes was the use of ferrers diagram representation of rank - metric codes which fit into a row - reduced echelon form representation of subspaces in a grassmannian ( @xcite ) , which was further employed in conjunction with a lexicographic ordering of subspaces ( @xcite ) .",

    "bounds on the size of projective space codes , analogous to classical coding theoretic ones , and some explicit constructions of non - constant dimension codes were presented in @xcite . + a new paradigm in random network coding was introduced by the so - called orbit codes @xcite , which generalizes some of the results in @xcite and describes constant dimension subspace codes as orbits of the action of suitable subgroups of the general linear group on a grassmannian .",

    "[ eq : choice ] , which is based on the lower bound on the dimension of the fdrm subspace code given in theorem [ th : fdrm ] , ensures that at every stage a schubert cell which supports the largest fdrm code is chosen among the contending cells .",

    ". hence the algorithm proceeds by choosing either of these subspaces ( different when @xmath0 odd ) in the first step .",
    "the above algorithm and that stated in @xcite differ in two aspects , one of which can be explained as a general reformulation and the other , a slight modification .",
    "_ binary profile vectors vs. characteristic tuples : _ in @xcite , the selection of schubert cells is based on the so - called binary profile vectors associated with each cell .",
    "the ferrers diagram representation of each profile vector then gives the dimension and the positions of non - zero entries of the appropriate rank - metric code . in our construction",
    "we simply use the characteristic tuple representation of each schubert cell and the rank - metric code is likewise specified by the so - called schubert cell `` matrix '' ( with the asterisks in the `` basis vectors '' replacing the dots in the ferrers diagrams ) - a direct formulation .    _ the choice function for the greedy algorithm : _ the following scoring function is used to select a new profile vector @xmath309 in @xcite : @xmath310 where @xmath311 , @xmath312 the ( hamming ) weight of the binary vector @xmath313 , @xmath314 the complement of @xmath309 and @xmath315 the support of @xmath309 , i.e. the set whose elements denote the positions of the 1 s in @xmath309 .",
    "it is evident that the sum term in the above scoring function computes @xmath271 , the number of asterisks in the ` matrix ' representation of the chosen schubert cell in our framework , which , in our choice function ( equation [ eq : choice ] ) , is the exact formula based on the characteristic tuple . rewriting the second term in equation [ eq : choice ] as @xmath316 makes it equivalent to the second term of equation [ eq : scorefk ] .",
    "it modifies the parameter @xmath317 by subtracting the number of leftmost all - zero columns in @xmath268 , which is not necessary for making a choice in our framework .",
    "we compute lower bounds on the rates of codes constructed for a given minimum subspace distance ( using symmetric distance ) and for a given minimum injection distance ( using the modified symmetric distance ) , from the values of the choice function ( equation [ eq : choice ] ) for each selected schubert cell . for a selected set of schubert cells",
    "@xmath318 , a lower bound on the code rate of a non - constant dimension fdrm subspace code over a finite field @xmath2 is given by the formula : @xmath319 where + @xmath320    it is seen that the calculated lower bound is not simply a computation of the choice function in each case and then summing the values in the exponent .",
    "the justification for this modification is as follows : the choice function @xmath298 for a schubert cell @xmath321 is zero or negative when it does not support a rank - metric code of the given dimensions with the prescribed minimum rank - distance .",
    "however , the particular schubert cell still maintains the inter - cell minimum subspace or injection distance and so contributes at least one subspace codeword to the entire code . to give a simple illustration ,",
    "consider the following construction of a non - constant dimension fdrm subspace code in @xmath322 with minimum subspace distance @xmath323 .",
    "a set @xmath318 for this code consists of schubert cells specified by the tuples @xmath324 , with corresponding choice function values of @xmath325 , respectively . for the second tuple @xmath268",
    "has only @xmath326 asterisks while the last one has none , being the @xmath327 identity matrix , obviously not enough to support the required rank - metric code in each case .",
    "however , they can still contribute a single subspace codeword each . + in table @xmath328 we have given a few lower bounds on the code rates in our construction with respect to given minimum subspace distance ( column lb(@xmath329 ) ) and minimum injection distance ( column lb(@xmath330 ) ) for some small field sizes @xmath331 and projective dimensions @xmath332 .",
    "it is seen that they are comparable with those of the actual codes constructed in @xcite , which are also presented in the columns ` kk(@xmath330 ) ' ( minimum injection distance ) and ` kk(@xmath329 ) ' ( minimum subspace distance ) .",
    "in fact , for subspace distance the rates of the constructed codes actually coincide with the computed lower bound in half of the cases , while the other values show only marginal improvement .",
    "the difference between the rates of the constructed codes and the computed lower bounds is more pronounced for injection distance .",

    "we have established a unified framework for the construction of constant - dimension random network codes in terms of the classical description of the subspaces of a projective space using the plcker coordinates .",
    "further we have given a general construction of non - constant dimension subspace codes , which exploits a basic representation of schubert systems , for both the subspace distance and the injection distance metrics .",
    "we have demonstrated that our framework subsumes the construction of @xcite , which is corroborated by the proximity of the estimated lower bounds for our construction with the actual code rates given for small parameters in @xcite . some questions regarding",
    "the above constructions remain open :    for the non - constant dimension fdrm subspace codes , will an exhaustive search algorithm yield a significantly better code - rate than the lower bound based on a greedy search",
    "? is there a systematic search procedure to achieve the best possible code - rate ?",
    "is it possible to obtain a set ( or better still , a group ) of subspaces within a selected schubert cell larger than the largest ferrers - diagram rank - metric code , which satisfies the minimum subspace / injection distance condition ?",
    "this problem is a constant - dimension subspace code construction problem with the added constraint of the schubert cell structure .",
    "so far there have been several approaches to the decoding problem of constant dimension codes in general ( @xcite ) , of spread codes in particular , ( @xcite ) and employing list decoding methods ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "decoding of ` punctured ' non - constant dimension codes is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a possible decoding strategy of our non - constant dimension subspace codes and those in @xcite involves two steps :    estimating the schubert cell to which the transmitted subspace belongs . in @xcite , so - called binary asymmetric codes with minimum asymmetric distance greater than or equal to the minimum injection distance and binary codes with minimum hamming distance greater than or equal to the minimum subspace distance have been used to estimate the profile vector corresponding to the schubert cell containing the transmitted subspace . in our construction , a similar procedure , identifying each characteristic tuple with a codeword of a binary asymmetric code or that of a binary code with the same relations on the injection and subspace distances , would suffice for estimating the tuple corresponding to the schubert cell .    estimating the transmitted subset within the schubert cell , which is the decoding problem for rank - metric constant - dimension subspace codes .",
