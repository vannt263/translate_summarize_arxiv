    "inflation has proven to be the most efficient mechanism to overcome difficulties such as the horizon and the flatness problems that plague the standard , hot , big bang cosmological model .",
    "importantly , in addition to resolving such issues , inflation successfully generates primordial fluctuations which seed the formation of structures . over the years",
    ", numerous models have been proposed that lead to a sufficient duration of inflation and also produce perturbations of suitable amplitude and shape that are consistent with the observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite as well as other observational bounds .",
    "currently , many of the models that lead to slow roll inflation and , therefore , to a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum , seem to perform equally well against the available data  @xcite .",
    "the hope remains that further cmb data from the present and forthcoming missions such as planck  @xcite and the cosmic origins explorer  @xcite may help us discriminate better between the various models .",
    "although , a nearly scale invariant power spectrum predicted by slow roll inflation , along with the background @xmath0cdm model , matches the angular spectrum from the cmb observations quite well , there exists a few outliers ( notably , near the multipole moments of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , model independent reconstruction of the primordial spectrum from the observed pattern of the cmb anisotropies seem to suggest the possible presence of specific features in the spectrum ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for a different view , see refs .",
    "moreover , it has been found that certain localized features actually lead to a better fit to the data than the conventional power law spectrum ( in this context , see , for instance , refs .",
    "and , it should be noted here that generating such features require either one or more periods of deviation from slow roll inflation  @xcite or modifications to the initial conditions on the perturbations  @xcite .",
    "apart from localized features , it is interesting to examine whether the cmb data also point to non - local features ",
    "i.e . certain characteristic and repeated behavior that extend over a wide range of scales  in the primordial spectrum .",
    "a quick glance at the unbinned cmb data seems to suggest that , after all , such an eventuality need not altogether be surprising .",
    "in fact , earlier investigations on possible planck scale modifications to the primordial spectrum have indicated that continuing oscillations in the power spectrum can lead to a substantial improvement in the fit at the cost of two or three additional parameters  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we shall investigate two inflationary models that lead to similar oscillations over all scales in the curvature perturbation spectrum .",
    "we shall consider a model described by the conventional quadratic potential , but superposed by a sinusoidal modulation  @xcite , and the presently popular axion monodromy model ( see , for example , refs .",
    "it should be mentioned here that these models have been compared with the wmap data recently  @xcite .",
    "however , all the earlier analyses had resorted to evaluating the scalar power spectrum in the slow roll approximation .",
    "in contrast , we shall compute the scalar power spectrum _",
    "exactly _ using a highly accurate numerical code . and , we shall evaluate the tensor spectrum too accurately and include it in our analysis .",
    "moreover , as the oscillations in the inflationary scalar power spectrum continue even over smaller scales , in addition to the wmap seven year data  @xcite , we shall compare the models with the small scale data from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite .",
    "we shall also arrive at the constraints on the model parameters using simulated planck data .",
    "while both the models that we consider lead to oscillations in the spectrum , we find that the monodromy model results in a superior fit to the data . further , as we shall see , the planck mock data leads to better constraints on the model parameters than the currently available cmb datasets .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall briefly describe the models that we shall consider and the methodology that we shall adopt to compare the models with the data . in the subsequent two sections",
    ", we shall present the results of our analysis and examine whether planck will be able to constrain the models better , respectively .",
    "we shall conclude with a brief summary and discussion in the final section .",
    "note that we shall work in units such that @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we shall assume the background cosmological model to be the standard , spatially flat , @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly describe the models that we shall work with and the methodology we shall adopt to compare the models with the data .      as we mentioned , we shall consider two models , the first of which is the chaotic inflationary that is modulated by sinusoidal oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the model is described by the potential v ( ) = m^2 ^ 2 [1 + (+ ) ] , [ eq : qpsin ] where , evidently , @xmath5 is the parameter that characterizes the original quadratic potential , while the parameters  @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the amplitude and the frequency of the superimposed oscillations .",
    "we have also included the parameter  @xmath8 , which shifts the oscillations within one period , in our analysis .",
    "the second model that we shall consider is the axion monodromy model which is motivated by string theory  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton potential in such a case is given by v ( ) = [+(+ ) ] .",
    "[ eq : amm ] note that , while the amplitude of the oscillation is fixed in the axion monodromy model , in the chaotic model described by the potential  ( [ eq : qpsin ] ) , the amplitude depends quadratically on the field .",
    "the inflaton oscillates as it rolls down these potentials , and these oscillations continue all the way until the end of inflation .",
    "this behavior leads to small oscillations in the slow roll parameters , which in turn results in continuing oscillations in the primordial scalar power spectrum .",
    "our goal is to examine the extent to which such oscillations are admitted by the cmb data .",
    "we shall compare the performance of the above two inflationary models with the conventional , power law , primordial spectrum . recall that",
    ", the power law , scalar and tensor spectra are usually written as ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) _ _ s(k)=a__s ()^n__s-1 _ _ t(k)=a__t ()^n__t , [ eq : ps - pl ] where the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the amplitude of the scalar and tensor spectra , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the corresponding spectral indices .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is the pivot scale at which the amplitudes of the power spectra are quoted .",
    "given the scalar and tensor spectra , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 is defined as the ratio of the latter to the former and , when comparing the power law case with the observations , it is the quantity  @xmath14 that is usually considered in lieu of the tensor amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "also , when considering the power law spectra , as is often done , we shall assume the slow roll consistency condition ( viz .",
    "that @xmath15 ) , so that the power law case is essentially described by the three parameters @xmath9 , @xmath11 and  @xmath14 .",
    "we shall now outline the methods that we adopt to evolve the equations governing the background and the perturbations , and eventually evaluate the inflationary scalar and the tensor perturbation spectra .",
    "recall that , in a friedmann universe , a canonical scalar field that is described by the potential @xmath16 satisfies the following equation of motion : + 3h+v_=0 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the hubble parameter , while , as usual , the overdots denote differentiation with respect to the cosmic time coordinate .",
    "we solve the above differential equation exactly using the standard fourth order runge - kutta method , with e - folds as the independent variable . in the case of the chaotic inflationary model with sinusoidal modulations , we choose the initial value of the field to be @xmath19 , while in the monodromy model , we set @xmath20 .",
    "we then make use of the governing equations , considered under the slow roll approximation , to determine the initial velocities of the field .",
    "these initial conditions allow sufficient number of e - foldings ( say , about @xmath21@xmath22 ) before inflation ends near the bottom of the potentials .",
    "further , following the convention , we shall choose the initial value of the scale factor to be such that the pivot scale @xmath23 leaves the hubble radius at @xmath24 e - folds before the end of inflation  @xcite .    in the spatially flat friedmann universe of our interest ,",
    "the fourier modes of the curvature perturbation  @xmath25 and the tensor perturbation  @xmath26 are described by the following equations  @xcite : r_k+2 r_k+k^2 r_k = 0h_k+2 h_k+k^2 h_k = 0 , where the overprimes denote differentiation with respect to the conformal time coordinate and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the scale factor .",
    "we impose the standard bunch - davies initial conditions on the perturbations when the modes are well inside the hubble radius [ say , when @xmath29 , and evolve them using a bulirsch - stoer algorithm with an adaptive step size control routine  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the scalar and the tensor perturbation spectra , viz . _",
    "_ s(k)= r_k^2 _ _ t(k)=8 h_k^2 , at super hubble scales , when the amplitude of the curvature and the tensor perturbations have frozen in [ typically , when @xmath30 .",
    "as we mentioned , we shall assume the background cosmological model to be the standard , spatially flat , @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the model can be characterized by the following four parameters :  @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the first two represent the baryon and the cdm densities ( with @xmath26 being related to the hubble parameter ) , while the last two denote the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling and the optical depth to reionization , respectively . in tab .",
    "[ tab : priors - bp ] below , we have listed the priors that we work with on these four parameters .",
    ".[tab : priors - bp]the priors on the four parameters that describe the background , spatially flat , @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we keep the same priors on the background parameters for all the models and datasets that we consider . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table it is clear that , the monodromy model leads to a much better fit to the data with @xmath35 improving by about @xmath36-@xmath37 .",
    "the table also seems to indicate two further points .",
    "firstly , even though the chaotic model with the sinusoidal modulation does not perform as well as the monodromy model , the fact that the model performs better when the small scale data from act is included suggests that oscillations can be favored by the data .",
    "secondly , oscillations of fixed amplitude in the potential as in the monodromy model seem to be more favored by the data than the oscillations of varying amplitude as in the case of the chaotic model with sinusoidal modulations .",
    "in fact , this strengthens similar conclusions that has been arrived at earlier  @xcite , wherein planck scale oscillations of a certain amplitude in the primordial spectrum was found to lead to a considerably better fit to the data .",
    "it is now interesting to enquire as to whether there exist localized windows of multipoles over which the improvement in the fit occurs .",
    "we find that , in the case of the chaotic model with sinusoidal modulations , as far as the wmap seven year data is concerned , there is an improvement of at most unity in all the multipoles combined .",
    "for the monodromy model , the improvement at high and the low multipoles ( i.e. @xmath38 ) are almost equal ( i.e. about @xmath39 ) in the wmap seven year @xmath40 data , and there is hardly any further improvement in the fit from the available @xmath41 and @xmath42 data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltachsq ] , we have plotted the difference @xmath43 $ ] as a function of the multipoles for the wmap seven year @xmath40 and @xmath41 data in the case of the axion monodromy model .",

    "-10 true pt    it is clear from the figure that the source of the improvement in the fit is not confined to any specific set of multipoles , and it arises due to small increments that accrue over the entire range of available data . in figs .",

    "in this section , we shall discuss the extent to which the data from planck  that is expected to be coming forth in the very near future  will be able to constrain the presence and characteristics of extended features in the primordial spectrum .",
    "many of the parameters of inflationary models of the type that we are considering here can have a credible physical influence on the cosmological data , even if their presence has not yet been detected .",
    "it is expected that data from current missions such as planck and beyond would be able to determine many of the presently unknown effects of the cosmological parameters . when performing a parameter error forecast for future observations , it is the fisher matrix formalism that is commonly adopted .",
    "the error bars on the additional parameters are estimated from the derivatives of the observables with respect to the model parameters around the best fit point ( for a discussion , see , for example , ref .",
    "such an analysis assumes that the likelihood of the cosmological parameters approximates a gaussian multivariate . however",
    ", parameter degeneracies can occur where certain combinations of the parameters are not well constrained by the data .",
    "also , the probability distribution of the parameters defined over a finite range may occasionally fail to converge at the boundaries .",
    "these lead to considerable deviations from the assumption of a multivariate gaussian function .",
    "we arrive at the possible constraints on the parameters using a different technique wherein we make suitable modifications to the cosmomc code with a publicly available add - on code futurcmb  @xcite . we firstly generate a simulated dataset for planck , using a realistic noise model and the sky coverage fraction @xmath47 . the cmb angular power spectrum generated from the best fit parameters of the models using the wmap seven year data is treated as the fiducial power spectrum for generating the planck mock data .",
    "we use this simulated data and incorporate the ` all_l_exact ' data format in the cosmomc code  @xcite to extract the projected parameter errors by sampling the likelihood and estimating the marginalized probability distribution in the parameter space . as we mentioned above",
    ", it is expected that this procedure would be more reliable than the fisher matrix analysis since there is no assumption on the likelihood functions of these parameters being multivariate gaussian distributions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : planck ] , we have plotted the unbinned , cmb @xmath40 angular power spectrum of the planck simulated data . to generate this mock data , we have considered the cmb @xmath40 angular power corresponding to the best fit parameters to the wmap seven year data of the axion monodromy model ( cf .",
    "[ tab : bfv - im ] ) as the fiducial power spectrum .",
    "-145 true pt -230 true pt 40 true pt 12 true pt @xmath44    we have plotted the resulting one dimensional distributions for the inflationary parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : one - d ] .",
    "the figure contains the constraints from the wmap-7 , wmap-7 + act as well as the planck simulated data for the original parameter @xmath5 of the chaotic model and the frequency parameter @xmath7 of the superimposed sinusoidal modulations . for the axion monodromy model , we have plotted the distributions for the initial parameter @xmath48 and the frequency parameter @xmath7 for the same datasets .",
    "[ fig : two - d ] contains the two dimensional contour plots for the above - mentioned set of parameters .",
    "again , we have displayed the constraints from all the three datasets .",
    "-10pt    10 pt    it can be easily perceived from these set of figures that the planck data leads to much tighter bounds on the inflationary parameters than the currently available data for the same range of priors for the various parameters .",
    "in this work , our main aim has been to investigate if the cmb data support certain non - local features ",
    "i.e . a certain repeated and characteristic pattern that extends over a wide range of scales  in the primordial scalar power spectrum . with this goal in mind ,",
    "we have studied two models of inflation , both of which contain oscillatory terms in the inflaton potential .",
    "the oscillations in the potential produces oscillations in the slow roll parameters , which in turn generate oscillations in the primordial as well as the cmb power spectra . earlier work in this context had utilized the analytical expressions for the primordial power spectra , obtained in the slow roll approximation , to compare such models with the data  @xcite .",
    "instead , we have used an accurate and efficient numerical code to arrive at the inflationary scalar and tensor power spectra .",
    "in fact , in order to ensure that a good level of accuracy , rather than evolve a finite set of modes and interpolate , we have evolved and computed the inflationary perturbation spectra for all the modes that is required by camb to arrive at the corresponding cmb angular power spectra . while this reflects the extent of the numerical accuracy of our computations , the efficiency of the code can be gauged by the fact that we have able to been able to complete the required runs within a reasonable amount of time despite such additional demands",
    ".    prior experience , gained in a different context , had already suggested the possibility that small and continued oscillations in the scalar power spectra can lead to a better fit to the data  @xcite .",
    "this experience has been corroborated by the earlier  @xcite and our current analysis .",
    "we find that , oscillations , such as those occur in the axion monodromy model lead to a superior fit to the data .",
    "we should , however , mention here that our numerical analysis indicates that the extent of the improvement does not amount to as much as it has been pointed to in the analytical approaches .",
    "while the analytical efforts had pointed to an improvement of about @xmath49 or so in the least squared parameter @xmath35 for the axion monodromy model , we find an improvement of about @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to comparing with the already available data , we have also discussed on the extent to which planck may be able to constrain the parameters that describe the oscillatory terms in the potential . rather than adopt the standard method of forecasting for the model parameters using the fisher matrix , we have been able to arrive at the constraints with suitable modifications to cosmomc .",
    "we believe that the method we have adopted is more reliable than the fisher matrix approach which does not work equally well when the parameters are not described by multivariate gaussian distributions .",
    "the one - dimensional marginalized distributions and the two - dimensional contours for the parameters of the inflationary models that we have arrived at show that future full sky cmb data sets such as planck would be capable of narrowing the constraints on these parameters considerably .",

    "<S> amongst the multitude of inflationary models currently available , models that lead to features in the primordial scalar spectrum are drawing increasing attention , since certain features have been found to provide a better fit to the cmb data than the conventional , nearly scale invariant , primordial spectrum . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we carry out an exact numerical analysis of two models that lead to oscillations _ over all scales _ in the scalar power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model described by a quadratic potential which is superposed by a sinusoidal modulation and the recently popular axion monodromy model . since the oscillations continue even onto smaller scales , in addition to the wmap data </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the models with the small scale data from act . </S>",
    "<S> though , both the models , broadly , result in oscillations in the spectrum , interestingly , we find that , while the monodromy model leads to a considerably better fit to the data in comparison to the standard power law spectrum , the quadratic potential superposed with a sinusoidal modulation does not improve the fit to a similar extent . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out forecasting of the parameters using simulated planck data for both the models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the planck mock data performs better in constraining the model parameters as compared to the presently available cmb datasets . </S>"
