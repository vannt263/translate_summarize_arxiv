    "by allowing us a detailed view of the full 2 - 200   spectral range ,  has dramatically increased our ability to investigate the processes giving rise to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies . yet before actually starting this review , let us use well - known galactic sources to exemplify the links between seds and the physical state of the objects in which they occur .      the mid - infrared ( mir , 5 - 40 ) is distinct from the far - infrared ( fir ) in the sense that it shows a large number of broad spectral bands ( especially in the 5 - 15  range ) and that most of the dust is out of thermal equilibrium , in a regime of transient heating .",
    "the interesting property of transient heating is that , for a range of energy densities , the mir flux scales linearly with the heating flux .",
    "this is clearly shown by where they compare the mir spectrum obtained on the peak of the ngc  7023 region ( exposed to a b star radiation field ) to that obtained on a diffuse cloud in the chameleon region : the radiation fields differ by more than 3 orders of magnitude yet the mir spectra are virtually identical .",
    "more quantitatively , they have shown that this linear scaling remains valid for radiation fields lower than a few 10@xmath0 times the solar neighborhood value .    without expanding on the nature of the dust giving rise to this family of bands ,",
    "it is worthwhile to list a few properties that  has now firmly established . even at the high resolution of the",
    ", the bands do not break up into a family of lines ( as suggested e.g. by ) .",
    "in fact , in most regions of the ism , the band profiles are very constant , and much better represented by lorentzian than by gaussian functions ( see e.g. ; ) . given the broad wings of a lorentzian , in regions where the bands are prominent , most of the detected flux actually comes from the band carriers .",
    "as the debate still continues on the exact nature of the carriers , we will refer to them as the `` infrared bands '' .",
    "studies of galactic regions also help to pinpoint the major sites of emission : although they are detected in diffuse cirrus clouds ( ) , most of the infrared band emission originates in the interface between  regions and molecular clouds , the photo - dissociation regions ( pdr , see e.g. ; ) .      from 10 - 15  to the submillimeter ,",
    "the seds of most sources consist of a broad continuum .",
    "this continuum can not be fitted by a single back - body curve . on the long wavelength side , this is due to the existence of more than one component of dust in thermal equilibrium . on the short wavelength side , this is due to the transition from the transient heating regime to the thermal equilibrium regime : below a size threshold fixed by grain properties and the radiation field intensity , dust grains still undergo noticeable temperature fluctuations . depending on the heating radiation field , continuum emission will start to dominate over the infrared bands in the 12 - 15  range ( e.g. in the pdr of m  17-sw , ) , or even over the whole mir range ( e.g. in the  region of m  17-sw , , see also the evolution of compact  region spectra in ) .",
    "one should note however that except in regions with a particularly hard radiation field , the mir spectrum is generally dominated by the infrared bands .",
    "the ir domain also gives access to very important diagnostic lines .",
    "these allow an almost extinction - free measurement of the intrinsic ionizing spectrum , the nature of the energy source , or the energetics of the interstellar medium ( e.g. through the 158  or 63  lines ) .",
    "the great advantage of iso in this area is the possibility to observe the full set of lines from an object , free of any foreground emission , in a single fixed aperture ( see e.g , for m82 ) .",
    "the three previous sections referred to emission processes occurring in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies",
    ". however , the ir is also a wavelength range where emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be detected .",
    "this can take two forms : ( 1 ) thermal emission from dust in the torus around the agn , in which case we expect a very hot continuum as grains probably reach their sublimation temperatures , and ( 2 ) synchrotron emission from charged particles in the agn strong magnetic field , in which case the emission takes the form of a featureless spectrum increasing with frequency .",
    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to the characterization of nearby spirals ir emission . this has led to a deeper understanding of the distribution of dust in galaxies .",
    "assuming that the  60 and 100  fluxes from galaxies sample a single dust phase , dust masses and temperatures have been computed .",
    "typical dust temperatures of @xmath130k and dust masses one order of magnitude below that deduced for the milky way were obtained ( e.g. ) .",
    "the advent of millimeter bolometers showed that this was likely an artifact of the wavelength domain sampled by , but uncertainties in the exponent of the emissivity in the fir / mm range prevented a definitive assessment of the question .    with the combination of  and ,",
    "this is now being resolved .",
    "the full fir / mm seds of nearby spiral galaxies reveal a consistent picture : in normal galaxies ( i.e. star - forming but not starbursting spirals ) most of the emission longward of 150 - 200  is provided by a cold dust phase ( t@xmath210 - 20k , ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "in fact , show clearly that the cold dust emission provides a significant fraction of the 100  flux .",
    "this mixed nature of the 100  band is very likely at the origin of numerous controversies on the interpretation of   luminosities .",
    "dust masses measurements now yield gas - to - dust ratios in external galaxies in the range 100 - 300 , much more in agreement with the value of @xmath1160 measured in our galaxy .",
    "these studies also point to a fir / mm emissivity index of 2 ( i.e. @xmath3 in @xmath4 ) rather than the more commonly used 1.5 .",
    "although all infrared maps show similar features , i.e. enhanced emission in the spiral arms and nucleus , a number of properties are emerging . and",
    "have shown that  200  maps of normal spirals have a scale - length which is as large , or even larger than that of the stars .",
    "as the dust temperature probably decreases outwards , this implies that the scale - length of the cold dust column density is even larger .",
    "comparison of radial profiles between cold dust traced at 850   with  and the atomic and molecular components show that while the cold dust is more extended than the molecular gas , it is still less extended than the  gas ( ) .",
    "furthermore the radial distributions of dust and molecular gas agree well in the central part of the disk ( ) .",
    "this suggests that this cold dust is mostly associated with the molecular gas but that a non - negligible fraction also resides in the  gas .",
    "as we progress outward in the galaxy , the ism becomes mostly atomic and the dust phase associated to  becomes more apparent .",
    "warmer dust , such as that detected by  or , is clearly less extended than the cold phase and has a scale length smaller than that of the stars . in ngc6946 , have shown that the  profiles at 6.75 and 15  have a scale length similar to that of the molecular gas and h@xmath5 emission .",
    "the 60  scale length is intermediate between that of molecular gas and stars .",
    "in fact it is close to that of the +  profiles , likely showing a transition between the warm and cold component . in a thorough  study of the sw ring in m31 , show a clear spatial correlation of the mir emission with  and , while the correlation is much poorer with h@xmath5 .",
    "this effect is also seen in ngc891 ( ) and ngc7331 ( ) .",
    "the association of the mir radiation with the +  gas in the inner part of the galaxies confirms that the emission originates mainly from the pdrs at the outer layers of interstellar clouds . instead , the larger scale - length of the fir / mm component points , for the colder dust , to an origin in the inner parts of interstellar clouds .",
    "a long standing question has been the heating source for the ir emission , and in particular , the extent to which this emission can be considered a good star formation tracer ( see e.g. ) .",
    "now allows us to re - address this question . examining the global luminosity of disks of spiral galaxies ,",
    "establish a clear correlation between the mir and h@xmath5 luminosity of _ disks _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sfr]a ) .",
    "this correlation is linear and implies that in the disks of normal galaxies , the energy source for the mir emission is the young stellar population and therefore that it can be used as a star formation tracer .",
    "there are however a few caveats : ( 1 ) in the disk of normal spirals , the broad - band  color is @xmath1 1 , as expected if there is little if any contribution from very small hot grains such as observed in  regions ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : continuum ] )",
    ". this will not be the case in stronger star forming galaxies ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : diags ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) the central regions of spiral galaxies typically have a lower  ratio ( e.g. ; ; ) , possibly indicating again a higher local star formation rate .",
    "therefore , in the case of an unresolved galaxy , argue that their calibration should provide a lower limit to the actual star formation rate .",
    "the possibility to separate the nuclear region from the disk of the galaxy in the mir now allows a re - investigation of the fir - h@xmath5 correlation .",
    "this correlation is known to be non - linear , implying that more than one process is present and that the fir can not be directly used to infer star - formation rates ( e.g. ) .",
    "have selected in their sample those galaxies with the smallest contribution of the central region _ in the mir maps _ and show that for this sample the fir - h@xmath5 correlation is very good and linear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr]b ) .",
    "this indicates that the non - linearity present in the general fir - h@xmath5 relation is induced by the nuclear component and that in the disk of normal galaxies , the fir emission collected by  is mostly from dust heated by the young stellar population .",
    "as already mentioned in section  [ subsec : sfr ] , some galaxies have mir colors that resemble those found in nearby  regions ( e.g. compare , to ) .",
    "this indicates that the mir - fir properties of galaxies are useful tools to monitor star formation .",
    "a first effect that can easily be understood is that the sed of a starburst galaxy is globally shifted toward higher dust temperatures .",
    "for instance , found that the starburst galaxies they studied did not require a cold ( 10k ) dust phase in their sed .",
    "this is also confirmed by , or in ngc 6090 ( ): the coldest dust phase required for these galaxies is 30 - 50k , in sharp contrast with what is obtained on normal spirals ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : cold ] ) .",
    "one should however note that these temperature decompositions depend highly on the exponent of the dust emissivity assumed ( @xmath3 = 1 - 2 ) : note that if @xmath3=2 were used for their sample , instead of @xmath3=1 , there would be room for a colder dust phase .",
    "therefore , rather than attempting to determine precise temperature values , one should remember that in starburst galaxies , the peak of the sed shifts from 100 - 200  to the 60 - 100  range .    the shift in the fir is obviously reflected in the mir .",
    "as the heating intensity rises , the small grain emission gradually shifts towards short wavelengths in the mir window ( see section  [ subsec : continuum ] ) , producing a steeply rising continuum that can start anywhere in the 4 - 20  range .",
    "it is important to realize that the wavelength at which the small grain continuum dominates over the infrared bands can vary and _",
    "is in fact most of the time beyond 12_. this can lead to some starburst galaxies being erroneously classified as normal from their -s spectrum ( e.g ) , which only extends to 12 .    observations of known starbursts in the mir also reveal that the infrared bands are rarely suppressed : all the star - forming regions of the antennae show significant , if not dominant , emission from the infrared bands ( ) ; the sample of galaxies with warm  colors selected by shows well - defined infrared bands but no sign yet of a rising continuum . finally , the template starburst spectrum used by ( again from -s ) is not markedly different from that of ngc  891 ( ) .",
    "therefore , the clear signature of a starburst - powered galaxy in the mir spectrum is more the presence of a strong continuum longward of @xmath112  than the absence of infrared bands ( see e.g. for a nice example on ngc5253 )    finally , an important point for starburst galaxies is the amount of extinction present on the line of sight . because infrared bands are located on both sides of the 9.7  silicate feature , a band - dominated extinction - free mir spectrum will still show a depression around 10 .",
    "optical depth measurements are thus better made with line ratios ( ) and , in starburst galaxies , span a very wide range , @xmath610 - 100 ( ) .",
    "more recently an attempt to measure the extinction by its imprint on the infrared band shapes has met with some success ( ) and confirmed the range mentioned above .",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to the understanding of the physical processes at work in high ir luminosity objects , mostly interacting / merging systems .",
    "although , as mentioned in , 3 - 4 of the 5 closest examples of ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) contain a powerful if not dominant agn , most iso studies on luminous ir galaxies emphasize the importance of the starburst process in the generation of the ir luminosity ( but see sec .",
    "[ sec : diags ] ) .",
    "a very interesting point comes from studies of luminous and ultraluminous ir galaxies ( the frontier being located at @xmath7 ) .    for their  sample of luminous ir galaxies ( lig ) ,",
    "show a clear anti - correlation between the compactness of the infrared source and the angular separation between the interacting objects .",
    "this seems at odds with the absence of any correlation in the mir properties of ulirgs with the angular separation ( but note that little ir imaging is available for ulirgs ) .",
    "similarly , have shown that , in ligs , there is a clear anti - correlation between the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and the angular separation ( i.e. higher sfe for closer pairs ) .",
    "no such correlation is seen in the ulirg sample of , but very interestingly , the maximum sfe reached by ligs is of the order of the mean sfe of ulirgs .",
    "this seems to place ulirgs as a limit - case for interaction triggered star - formation and may explain the lack of clear correlations with interaction parameters for the ulirg sample .",
    "it also supports the conclusions of e.g. and that the ulirg phenomenon is mostly related to individual properties of the interacting galaxies and not directly to the interaction itself .    of interest",
    "then are the spatially resolved observations of starburst galaxies and ulirgs .",
    "a common point of these studies is the discovery that in many cases , a significant part of the luminosity is produced by very compact , mostly extranuclear , sources .",
    "this was first seen in the antennae ( ) , but is now observed also in mrk  171 ( ) , ngc  253 ( ) , ngc  5253 ( ) , or arp  220 ( ) .",
    "a plausible interpretation of these sources is that they are buried super - star - clusters , that will later evolve in the blue super - star clusters seen in interacting galaxies ( e.g. ) . given the power output of these clusters , their infrared phase should be quite short , a fact that fits well in the scenario of starburst progression during the merging phase of interacting galaxies proposed by .",
    "one of the most surprising findings of  comes from : observed that galaxies with the highest  or star formation activity exhibited lower - than - expected -to - fir luminosity ratios .",
    "this was unexpected given that   is predicted to be strong in regions exposed to far - uv photons that abonds in these galaxies .",
    "this deficit was later confirmed by in a sample of ulirgs .",
    "reasons for this deficit are still unknown .",
    "extinction or self - absorption have been rejected as the very large @xmath8 required ( @xmath1400 - 1000 ) are not confirmed by any other extinction measurements .",
    "favored explanations are ( 1 ) a decreased efficiency of photoelectric heating in very high uv fields ( grains become positively charged or are destroyed , thus reducing the number of photo - electrons ) , or ( 2 ) softer than expected uv radiation fields in ulirgs due either to a troncated initial mass function or the presence of aging starburst regions .",
    "our understanding of active galaxies has advanced greatly in the recent years , mainly through multiwavelength observations of these objects . the infrared plays a particular role in these studies , for three reasons :    * it is in the infrared that the spectra of these objects peak .",
    "thus , a precise knowledge of the infrared flux is necessary to assess the bolometric luminosity , and the energetics of active galaxies .",
    "* multiwavelength observations of agns tend to support a unified scheme , according to which these objects are intrinsically similar , with various scales , but are viewed under different angles .",
    "an energy source in their center is surrounded by a torus of obscuring gas and dust , with a radius of parsecs to tens or a hundred parsecs .",
    "the observational properties of the objects depend not only of the energy source , but also on the angle at which they are observed with respect of the torus . in this scheme ,",
    "radio quiet , steep spectrum quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies are seen at intermediate angles , flat spectrum quasars and bl lac are pole - on , and radio - galaxies and seyfert 2 edge - on . in the infrared , it is possible to observe the direct emission of the torus .",
    "models indicate that tori are still optically thick in the mir (; ) .",
    "but in the fir a simple prediction of the unification models is that sources of similar energy should emit the same amount of thermal radiation from torus - heated dust . *",
    "the infrared is a domain so rich in spectral lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : circinus ] ) , less subject to absorption than the optical ones , that infrared spectra permit indirectly to determine the ionizing continuum .",
    "many  results on quasars and radio - galaxies are still pending , but those available tend to support the unification scheme . for radio",
    "quiet and steep spectrum qsos , the sed has a bump at around 60 , and declines beyond 100 , as expected for multi - temperature dust emission in the range of tens to hundreds of k ( ) .",
    "most interestingly , the prototype radiogalaxy cygnusa exhibits a similar sed ; but 3c20 , with a similar radio flux , is not seen by .",
    "also , on the whole , qsos appear to be more luminous in the fir than radio sources , thus , if the unification scheme is correct , the torus is also optically thick in the fir .",
    "the sed of flat - spectrum qsos is dominated by synchrotron emission , but for 3c279 , a variable quasar ,  the ( dust ) bump pryes above the synchrotron spectrum \" when the overall emission is low ( ) . in the case of seyfert galaxies , the synchrotron emission is weak or absent in the ir . in the course of a study with  of 10 cfa galaxies , decompose the emission in two or three phases : warm ( 150k , corresponding to the nucleus ) , cold ( 40 to 50k , star forming regions ) , very cold ( 10 to 20k , cirrus ) . as expected from the unification scheme ,",
    "the warm phase is colder for seyferts2 than for seyferts1 .",
    "the respective extensions of the cold and the warm component in the ir are similar to those of the cold and the hot component in the r band .",
    "but , in the fir , the nuclear emission can be a substantial fraction of the total fir , and thus of the total @xmath9 of the galaxy .",
    "did a statistical study with -s encompassing 26 seyfert1 and 28 seyfert2 galaxies .",
    "they found that while seyfert2 exhibit a weak continuum and strong infrared bands , seyfert1 have 7 times stronger continua and weak or non - existing infrared bands .",
    "this also agrees with expectations from mir optically thick torus models .      with the spectrometers on board of , complemented by -s and the cvf of , it has been possible to obtain a wide variety of results on seyfert infrared spectral properties .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : circinus ] the combined +  spectrum of circinus , a prototype seyfert 2 at 4mpc ( ) . there are 30 fine structure lines in this spectrum , emitted by species with ionization energies in the 8 to 300ev range . note in particular the prominent high excitation lines of  and , mainly produced by the hard photons of agns .",
    "detailed modeling allowed to derive from this spectrum the ionizing euv continuum , assuming that clouds are ionization bounded .",
    "the result is a very hard ionizing continuum , with a very pronounced bump around 70ev .",
    "this big blue bump is required by accretion disk models ( ) , and can be considered the signature of a black hole .",
    "however , a similar derivation made by on the seyfert  1 ngc  4151 , at 13mpc , concluded that in the euv spectrum of this galaxy there is a void , rather than a bump , at 70ev ; they attribute this to absorption by neutral hydrogen placed between the narrow line region and the ionizing source .",
    "in addition to an active nucleus , circinus is known to also have a circumnuclear starburst ( ) ; salient features of its spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : circinus ] ) , apart from the large number of fine structure lines , are the presence of infrared bands , the continuum bump due to hot dust and the broad silicate absorption around 9.7 . in a subsequent study , using the -cvf , showed that the infrared band emission does not originate in the starburst ring , but is in fact caused by the remnants of an earlier starburst episode .",
    "another interesting case is that of centaurus  a , the closest active galaxy , at only 3.1mpc , which is suspected of hosting a misaligned bl  lac nucleus ( e.g. ) at the center of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "an  map by reveals the presence of a bisymmetric structure , similar to that of a barred spiral galaxy , in the central region of the giant elliptical galaxy . this strange  galaxy \"",
    "is composed of the tidal debris of small galaxies accreted by the elliptical galaxy in the last @xmath10  years .",
    "recently observed this object with _",
    "nicmos _ , on board",
    "_ hst _ , and found pa@xmath5 emission indicative of enhanced star formation at the edges of the bar seen with , probably due to shocks associated with the bar .",
    "the  spectrum of centaurus  a ( ) is that of an agn with a circumnuclear starburst , and has been modeled by these authors with a 3.6pc torus inclined at 45@xmath11 .",
    "-cvf spectra from 5 to 16  permit to distinguish very clearly between the nucleus dominated by a fast rising continuum , and the star formation regions emitting essentially in the infrared bands .",
    "the first such tool is one that combines  and  information in the so - called -  color diagram .",
    "it compares the  ratio from  to the  ratio from  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagplot]a ) .",
    "it is a first step in assessing the nature of  galaxies . for a large range of  colors ,",
    "the  color is roughly constant .",
    "this is the space occupied by normal star forming galaxies .",
    "it is only beyond an  color @xmath12 - 0.2 that the  color decreases . only blue compact , interacting or starburst galaxies occupy that part of the diagram , an expected fact from the previous discussion : the radiation field is high enough that the small grain continuum has been shifted into the  band .",
    "this region of the -  color diagram is obviously of high interest as it hosts galaxies providing most of the ir energy collected in the universe , and it has therefore been explored in more details .",
    "were very succesful in arranging a sample of 13 ulirgs on a plot representing the ratio /   versus the relative strength of the 7.7  infrared band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagplot]b ) . in this diagram ,",
    "the ulirgs tend to lie close to the starburst region , but some clearly contain an energetic agn",
    ". similar analyzes , using only the 7.7  line - to - continuum ( l / c ) tool on larger samples were presented by and from which they conclude that indeed the fraction of ulirgs powered by an agn increases with the infrared luminosity , but also that ulirgs are predominantly ( @xmath170 - 80% ) starburst powered .",
    "this 7.7  l / c tool is however ambiguous as some starbursts have no infrared bands while some agn exhibit strong bands .",
    "thus the diagnostic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagplot]c ) , working on the broader  band , uses the flux ratio of the broad 6.75  to the broad 15  band compared to the flux ratio of the broad 6.75  band to the narrow 6  band to make a finer distinction between agn , starburst and normal star - forming regions .",
    "given that agns and starbursts have very different continuum shapes , this tool is very successful in distinguishing one from the other .",
    "since agns have much more flux in the 6  range than starburst or star - forming galaxies , a `` band - less '' starburst is not mistaken for an agn . applying this tool to ulirgs",
    "show that a fraction larger than that identified by e.g. is agn - powered .",
    "this type of method has great potential for future studies with the ngst , if its wavelength range is sufficiently extended .",
    "gains in sensitivity with , compared to  at 12 , have made it possible to extend the range of mir counts by three orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly  allowed to perform , for the first time , surveys at 175 , a range of considerable cosmological interest .",
    "the iso counts give a radically new view of star formation in the universe between now and @xmath132 .",
    "surveys have essentially been performed in two filters , around 6.75 and 15  ( but see also the 12  survey of ) . throughout this review ,",
    "we have presented , discussed or alluded to template spectra of the various galaxy types in the mir . for nearby objects , the 6.75  filter probes infrared bands , while the 15  filter probes preferentially warm dust and neon lines . as the redshift increases , the infrared bands are more and more shifted to the 15  filter . for galaxies intrinsically bright in these bands ,",
    "the k correction at 15  is positive ( sources appear to be fainter with increasing distances ) , but flat between @xmath14 and 1.3 . for objects with @xmath15 , the 6.75  filter has access only to the starlight or to an eventual agn contributions ;",
    "the same is true at 15  if @xmath16 ( see ; ) .",
    "the situation is even more favorable for surveys with isophot at 175 ; there , since most galaxy seds peak well below this wavelength , as @xmath17 increases , the k correction is negative , favoring detection of distant galaxies .",
    "the fields surveyed have been selected for their low zodiacal and cirrus emission ; the second point is particularly important for the fir studies .",
    "they can be found , in the northern hemisphere , in the lockman hole , and in the southern hemisphere , in the marano field .",
    "both fields have been the subject of multiwavelength studies , but often not to the depth required to interpret the results of  surveys .",
    "these surveys are therefore well complemented by studies on well - known fields , the hdf north and a cfrs field at 6.75 and 15 , and the ssa13 field at 6.75 .",
    "few results are available on the other fields at 6.75 , where observations at other wavebands , not yet available for many of the surveys , are crucial to avoid contamination by galactic stars ( but see ; ; ) , and for lack of space we concentrate here , for isocam , on 15  results .      combining the deep survey on a cfrs field ( ) and that on the hdf north ( ) , 83 galaxies have been detected at 15 , with fluxes in excess of 250@xmath18jy for the cfrs , and @xmath19100@xmath18jy for the hdf .",
    "the positional accuracy of 6@xmath20 allowed in almost all cases to identify an optical counterpart , brighter than i(kron - cousins)@xmath223 ; the mean redshift is 0.7 .    in the cfrs field , flores et al . derived the type of the galaxies for which they had enough spectral information , including radio fluxes , by comparing their sed to local templates compiled by .",
    "they found that more than two thirds of these galaxies are starburst or post - starburst , and that at least at @xmath21 to 0.6 , their overall contribution to the global star formation rate is dominant .",
    "aussel et al . ,",
    "( 1999a , b ) compared the 27 mir hdf sources with known redshift to a reference sample of hdf sources from an optical catalogue .",
    "while the redshift distribution of the two samples are similar , the color distributions are very different .",
    "picks up galaxies with b - i colors corresponding to spirals , and is blind to the faint blue population responsible for the excess in the b counts ( ) . in summary : it appears that most of the mir galaxies have luminosities of the order or brighter than @xmath22 ( i.e. ligs but not uligs ) , and are spiral or merging systems with normal colors , harboring an obscured starburst or a very well hidden active nucleus .",

    "these counts are complemented , at flux @xmath192mjy , by the results of elais ( pi m. rowan robinson ; see ) .",
    "five independent surveys confirm the breaks of these curves at 400@xmath18jy ; in the differential plot , the slope passes from ( -1.6 ) to ( -3 ) for faint sources .",
    "on the same figures are shown the expectations from models assuming no evolution , which take into account the infrared bands in the galaxy spectra . despite the uncertainties in these curves ( see discussion in ) , there is no question that at least at fluxes below 400@xmath18jy , these source counts imply strong evolution in the population of mir sources .",
    "the  counts also indicate that the sources responsible for them are not ulirgs with spectra like arp220 ; otherwise , they would produce an infrared background at 140  in excess of the value observed by _ cobe _ ( ) .      deep counts with  at 175  in the lockman hole and in the marano field (;",

    "for these sources , identifications are uncertain , given the large error boxes . because of the large negative k  correction at this wavelength , it is likely that some of the sources seen are at @xmath17 in the range 1 to 2 .",
    "indeed , using the  results , one can show that they can not be a population of galaxies with average redshift 0.7 and a spectrum like m82 or arp220 , since in that case  would see many more sources in the range @xmath191mjy ( ) . thus , while a fraction of the sources are in common , on the average  and  sample different populations of sources .",
    "while  pinpoints those of the b and k sources , at @xmath24 , that harbor activity hidden by dust ,  misses many of them but can find more distant far - infrared beacons .",
    "a conclusion on such a broad subject is hard to write , when a large number of our colleagues are devoting most of their time to a finer analysis of the  data .",
    "let us instead remark that the areas where new infrared data turn out to be of key importance are growing day by day , strongly supporting future infrared missions .",
