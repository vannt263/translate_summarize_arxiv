    "the achievement of quantum degeneracy in bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite gases of alkali atoms has opened the way to the investigation and manipulation of novel states of atomic matter , such as bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite and superfluid fermi gases @xcite .",
    "a simple but reliable theoretical tool for the study of these trapped degenerate gases is the density - functional theory @xcite . in particular , the gross - pitaevskii  equation ( gpe ) , which accurately describes becs in dilute gases ,",
    "is the euler - lagrange equation produced by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) density functional which takes into regard the inhomogeneity of the condensate @xcite . in parallel to that , many properties of superfluid fermi gases with balanced ( equally populated ) spin components , and the formation of various patterns in them , can be accurately described , under the conditions of the bcs - bec crossover , by an extended tf density functional and its time - dependent version , as it has been shown recently @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental effects in nonlinear media , including bec , which has been studied in detail , is the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in double - well potentials ( dwps ) .",
    "_ asymmetric _ states trapped in symmetric dwps are generated by symmetry - breaking bifurcations from obvious symmetric or antisymmetric states , in the media with the attractive or repulsive intrinsic nonlinearity , respectively @xcite [ the ssb under the action of competing attractive ( cubic ) and repulsive ( quintic ) terms was studied too @xcite ] . in terms of bec and other macroscopic quantum systems",
    ", the ssb may be realized as a _ quantum phase transition _ , which replaces the original symmetric ground state by a new asymmetric one , when the strength of the self - attractive nonlinearity exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "actually , a transition of this type was predicted earlier in the classical context , _",
    "viz_. , in a model of dual - core nonlinear optical fibers with the self - focusing kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "still earlier , the ssb of nonlinear states was studied , in an abstract form , in the context of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with a potential term @xcite , as well in the discrete self - trapping model scott .",
    "the latter approach to the description of the ssb effects was later developed in many works in the form of the two - mode expansion , each mode representing a mode which is trapped in one of the potential wells ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as concerns the interpretation of the ssb as the phase transition , it may be categorized as belonging to the first or second kind ( alias sub- or supercritical ssb mode ) , depending on the form of the nonlinearity , spatial dimension , and the presence or absence of a periodic external potential ( an optical lattice ) acting along the additional spatial dimension ( if any ) @xcite .  in the experiment ,",
    "the self - trapping of asymmetric states has been demonstrated in the condensate of @xmath1rb atoms with repulsive interactions heidelberg .",
    "theoretical studies of the ssb in becs were extended in various directions .",
    "in particular , the symmetry breaking of matter - wave solitons was predicted in various two - dimensional ( 2d ) dwp settings @xcite , including the spontaneous breaking of the _ skew symmetry _ of solitons and solitary vortices trapped in double - layer condensates with mutually perpendicular orientations of quasi - one - dimensional optical lattices induced in the two layers @xcite .",
    "a different variety of the 2d geometry , which gives rise to a specific mode of the ssb , is based on a symmetric set of four potential wells @xcite ( a three - well system was considered too @xcite ) .",
    "recently , self - trapping of asymmetric states was predicted in the model of the bec of dipolar atoms , which interact via long - range forces @xcite .",
    "ssb was also studied in the context of the nlse with a general nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the symmetry breaking is possible not only in linear potentials composed of two wells , but also in a similarly structured _ pseudopotential _ , which is produced by a symmetric spatial modulation of the non - linearity coefficient , with two sharp maxima @xcite .",
    "another generalization is the study of the ssb in two- @xcite and three - component ( spinor ) @xcite bec mixtures , where the asymmetry of the density profiles in the two wells is coupled to a difference in distributions of the different species .",
    "further , the analysis was extended to a bose - fermi ( bf ) mixture in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a  frozen \" fermion component was treated as a source of an additional potential for bosons .",
    "dynamical manifestations of the symmetry breaking ( josephson oscillations ) in a fermi superfluid trapped in the dwp were recently considered too @xcite .    in spite of many realizations of the ssb studied in the models of degenerate quantum gases , the self - trapping of stationary asymmetric states",
    "has not yet been considered in fermionic systems .",
    "an obvious problem is that a fermi gas , loaded into a dwp , can not feature a direct self - attractive nonlinearity , which is necessary to induce the ssb in symmetric states .",
    "the objective of the present work is to introduce a model in which the ssb in a trapped fermi superfluid is possible due to an effective attraction _ mediated by a bosonic component _",
    ", mixed with the fermionic one .",
    "actually , we consider the ssb in _ semi - trapped _",
    "bf mixtures , with the dwp acting on a single species , either the fermionic or bosonic one , as this setting may be sufficient to hold the entire mixture in the trapping potential , and induce the ssb in its fermionic component . the analysis will be performed in the framework of a mean - field model , which couples , via nonlinear attraction terms , the gpe for the bosonic component  to an equation for the fermionic order parameter , derived from the respective density functional .",
    "inducing an effective boson - mediated attraction between the fermions requires an attractive bf interaction . for this purpose , we take well - known physical parameters corresponding to the @xmath5 mixture , which features repulsion between rubidium atoms and attraction between the rubidium and potassium , characterized by the respective positive and negative scattering lengths , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we consider the case when the spin - balanced fermionic component of the mixture is in the unitary regime , corresponding to a diverging scattering length which accounts for the interaction between the fermionic atoms with opposite orientations of the spin , @xmath8 ( while the bcs regime corresponds to the vanishingly weak attraction , with @xmath9 in either limit , the effective fermionic lagrangian does not depend explicitly on @xmath10 ) .",
    "in fact , the same model with a different coefficient of the effective self - repulsion in the fermi superfluid applies to the description of the bf mixture with the fermionic component falling into the bcs regime .",
    "although the self - interaction , induced by the quantum pressure , in the equation for the fermionic order parameter is always repulsive , we demonstrate that the ssb in the fermionic component is indeed possible in the @xmath11 mixture , due to the bf attraction which , as said above , mediates an effective attraction force in the fermi superfluid .",
    "we also conclude that the attraction can induce symmetry - preserving or symmetry - breaking localization of both components in the semi - trapped mixture , depending on the numbers of the bosons and fermions in it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is formulated , in a sufficiently detailed form , in section ii .",
    "results produced by the numerical analysis are reported in section iii , for two variants of the model , with the dwp acting either only on the fermions , or on the bosons . in section iv",
    ", we report approximate analytical results , obtained by means of the tf approximation applied to the gpe for the bosonic wave function . in particular",
    ", assuming a specific linear relation between the fermion and boson numbers , we can reduce the model to a single equation for the fermionic wave function with competing self - repulsive and self - attractive terms , the latter one explicitly demonstrating the mechanism of the effective attraction between the fermions mediated by  enslaved \" bosons .",

    "[ ssb - f2 ] ) , tend to form a _ closed loop _ connecting an initial symmetry - breaking bifurcation and a final symmetry - restoring one .",
    "the difference of eq .",
    "( f ) is that here the self - focusing ( cubic ) term has a higher nonlinearity power than its self - defocusing counterpart of power @xmath198 , therefore no closed - loop bifurcation diagram is expected in the present case .",

    "( leftright ) . the ssb border can be found by looking for a point where a solution with an infinitely small antisymmetric perturbation ( @xmath207 ) , @xmath208 , branches off from the parent symmetric state . by performing this analysis ( we do not display straightforward details here )",
    ", one finds that the value of @xmath209 for ssb scales inversely proportional to @xmath210 , hence the increase of the number of particles facilitates the transition to the asymmetric ground state , as one may expect .",
    "the objective of this work is to extend the analysis of the ssb ( spontaneously symmetry breaking ) in dwp settings ( double - well potentials ) , which was recently studied in bec and bosonic mixtures , to the bf ( bose - fermi ) mixtures .",
    "the system is described by the gpe ( gross - pitaevskii equation ) for the bosons , which is nonlinearly coupled to the equation for the fermionic order parameter derived from the density functional in the unitarity limit ( in fact , a similar model also applies to the bf mixture with the fermionic component kept in the bcs regime ) .",
    "direct symmetry breaking in the fermi superfluid trapped in the dwp is impossible , as it must be induced by attractive interactions , while density perturbations in the degenerate fermionic gas interact repulsively .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that the ssb is possible in the mixture of @xmath1rb and @xmath72k atoms , due to the attraction between fermions and bosons .",
    "the most interesting case , when the effective ssb in the fermionic component could be studied in the  pure form \" , is that when the fermions are subject to the action of the dwp , while there is no potential confining the bosons .",
    "we have also investigated the alternative situation , with the dwp acting solely on the bosons .",
    "our phase diagrams in the @xmath211 plane , produced by means of numerical methods , clearly show that the inter - atomic attractions can produce both symmetric and symmetry - broken localization of the atoms which are not subject to the direct action of the trapping potential . applying the tf ( thomas - fermi ) approximation to the bosonic equation",
    ", we have also developed an analytical approximation , which allows us to reduce the model to the single equation for the fermionic function . in the latter case ,",
    "the model explicitly demonstrates the generation of the effective attraction between fermions mediated by the bosons .",
    "the analysis reported in this work can be extended in other directions .",
    "a straightforward generalization may deal with the system including the confining potential in both components , as well as a more general analysis of the tf approximation .",
    "a challenging possibility is to predict similar effects in multi - dimensional bose - fermi mixtures .",
