    "in recent years , @xmath0 two - leg spin ladders have attracted considerable interests from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "the two - leg spin ladders are ideal models for quasi - one - dimensional materials such as srcu@xmath16o@xmath17 @xcite , for which a spin gap has been observed .",
    ". _ @xcite and rice _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested moreover that hole doping to the two - leg spin ladders brings the superconductivity . with respect to theoretical interest , barnes _",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder with @xmath0 spins ( afhl ) as shown in fig.[fig : afhl ] has a spin gap for all nonzero values of interchain interactions @xmath9 .",
    "the spin - pair correlation function of the afhl decays exponentially , in contradiction to that of the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , which has a gapless spectrum and a power - law decay of the spin - pair correlation function .",
    "it is believed that the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) picture is valid for the ground state of the afhl @xcite .",
    "we have another low - dimensional gapped system , that is the @xmath18 heisenberg ( haldane ) chain @xcite .",
    "it is known as haldane s conjecture that the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains with integral spins are gaped , while the chains with half - integral spins are gapless @xcite .",
    "the valence bond solid ( vbs ) state of affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model @xcite is believed to be an ideal example of the haldane state of the @xmath18 system .",
    "this exactly soluble aklt model has biquadratic term @xmath19 in addition to the usual heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "white @xcite presented a numerical evidence for equivalence of the vbs ( haldane ) state and the rvb state .",
    "this implies that the spin gap in both the haldane chain and the afhl is due to the same mechanism .",
    "kolezhuk and mikeska @xcite also argued the equivalence of the @xmath18 haldane chain and an @xmath0 ladder which includes biquadratic terms in addition to the usual bilinear terms .",
    "they used a method of the matrix - product ( mp ) wave functions in order to discuss exact ground states of these systems and obtained phase transition points where the spin gaps remain finite @xcite .    for the @xmath0 two - leg spin ladder",
    ", it has been suggested that frustration brings a phase boundary where the spin gap vanishes @xcite .",
    "the frustration is due to bilinear terms which consist of the next - nearest - neighbor spins in the ladder .",
    "it is known that a combination of bilinear and biquadratic terms can provide a cyclic four - spin exchange interaction @xcite , whose interaction constant is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "et al._@xcite pointed out that a moderate value of @xmath1 for @xmath7 is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore they found that the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction reduces an amount of the spin gap substantially .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to clarify an effect of the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction , which consists of bilinear and biquadratic terms of spin operators and gives a frustration on the ladder , on the quantum phase transition .",
    "we carry out the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method for the @xmath0 two - leg spin ladder with the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction and investigate the spin gap between the singlet and the triplet states .",
    "we find that the spin gap vanishes at @xmath6 for @xmath7 , although we have finite spin gaps for @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore at @xmath21 for @xmath7 we observe a larger value of the correlation length for the spin - pair correlation function than the system size @xmath10 by assuming an exponential decay of the spin - pair correlation function .",
    "we also find that the string correlation function decays rather algebraically than exponentially at this point .",
    "those results suggest that there is a quantum phase transition at this point . a phase boundary in the @xmath14 plane obtained in the present study is consistent with that obtained by a perturbation theory for @xmath15 @xcite .    in section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "we express the @xmath0 two - leg spin ladder model with the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction . in section [ sec : results ] , we present our results by the dmrg method : we discuss the spin gap in subsection [ subsec : gap ] , the spin - pair correlation function in subsection [ subsec : spin - pair ] , the string correlation function in subsection [ subsec : string ] and the phase boundary in @xmath14 plane in subsection [ subsec : phase_diagram ] . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we give conclusions of the present study .",
    "the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder of @xmath0 ( afhl ) is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 express the pauli spin operators on chain 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "those operators are shown by circles in fig.[fig : afhl ] .",
    "the intrachain and the interchain interaction constant are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively , and are assumed to be antiferromagnetic : @xmath25 .",
    "they are shown by solid and broken lines in fig.[fig : afhl ] , respectively .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath26 by the ratio of these interactions as follows : @xmath27 the hamiltonian with the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction is described as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 means a permutation operator of four spins .",
    "this operator expresses a cyclic permutation of four spins clockwise : @xmath30 ( see fig.[fig : afhl_ring ] ) .",
    "the inverse operator @xmath31 expresses the permutation of those four spins counterclockwise .",
    "the sum of these permutation operators is expressed by a sum of spin operators as follows : @xmath32 in this way , the sum of the permutation operators is expressed by a combination of bilinear terms and biquadratic terms of intrachain spins and interchain spins .",
    "in the present study , we use the infinite system algorithm of the dmrg method .",
    "all of the data calculated in the present study are obtained by using the open boundary conditions . by dividing the present section into 4 subsections",
    ", we present our results as for the spin gap , the correlation length of spin - pair correlation function , the string correlation function and the phase diagram in turn .",
    "we define the spin gap as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the lowest energies for which the total value of @xmath36-component of the spin operator , namely @xmath37 , is 0 or 1 , respectively , for the ladder of length @xmath10 ; there are @xmath38 sites in the ladder .",

    "we estimate the value of the spin gap in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 using the values for @xmath46 . in this extrapolation ,",

    "the case of @xmath51 corresponds to two independent chains since there is no interchain interaction .",

    "is a typical example of size dependence of the spin gap in the dmrg method , which occurs for the system with a finite value of the spin gap .",
    "we estimate the spin gap for @xmath58 and @xmath50 to be 0.218 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we notice that the both cases , @xmath59 and @xmath60 give similar values for the spin gap . hence there is a possibility that the assumption @xmath54 is not valid for the analysis of results for nmr or nqr .",
    "in our calculations , the spin gap decreases as the value of @xmath1 increases .",
    "we show the result for @xmath11 and @xmath50 in fig.[fig : gap_a1j403_ldep ] .",
    "we find that the values of the spin gap for @xmath61 and for @xmath62 show different behavior as for size dependence , especially for smaller system sizes .",
    "therefore , the data for @xmath63 are discarded for an extrapolation to @xmath45 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath64 for @xmath11 and @xmath50 .",
    "we show the value of spin gap as a function of @xmath57 for @xmath50 in fig.[fig : gap_a1j4dep ] . as the value of @xmath57 increases , the value of spin gap decreases gradually .",

    ", we assume the asymptotic behavior of the spin - pair correlation function as follows : @xmath72 on the other hand , we expect the power - law decay of the spin - pair correlation function in the gapless case as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 means the critical exponent for the correlation function .",
    "inset of fig.[fig : corr_a1j4025 ] is a semilogarithmic plot of the absolute value of the spin - pair correlation function .",
    "a deviation from linear shape around @xmath75 is due to the effect of the open boundary .",
    "we have used a range @xmath76 for estimation of the correlation length @xmath12 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath12 is estimated to be 58.6 for @xmath71 and @xmath50 by use of the least squares method for the semilogarithmic plot .",
    "this value of the correlation length is much larger than @xmath77 for the afhl , namely @xmath40 and @xmath50 . in the fitting by the least squares method , we obtain the error sum of squares ( ess ) is 0.00029 for @xmath71 and @xmath50 by assuming the form ( [ eq : correlation_exp ] ) . on the other hand , we obtain the ess is 0.0034 by assuming the form ( [ eq : correlation_pow ] ) with @xmath78 as the best fitting .",

    "next , we show the spin - pair correlation function for @xmath11 and @xmath50 in fig.[fig : corr_a1j403 ] . we have obtained a quite large value for the correlation length , that is @xmath79,by assuming the exponential decay ( [ eq : correlation_exp ] ) where the ess is 0.0058 . by using the form ( [ eq : correlation_pow ] ) , we obtain 0.0045 for the ess with @xmath80 .",
    "then , there is a possibility that the spin - pair correlation function decays in the power - law in this case .",
    "these results are consistent with the result that there is no spin gap for this value of @xmath57 .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath81 for this quantum phase transition is different from @xmath82 for @xmath0 spin chain @xcite .",
    "the string correlation function is defined as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 we notice that @xmath85 in eq.([eq : sto ] ) consists of two @xmath0 spins as defined by eq.([eq : sto_pair ] ) .",
    "these two spins are also illustrated in fig.[fig : sto_pair ] .",
    "this choice of two @xmath0 spins was also adopted for the antiferromagnetic two - leg ladder without @xmath1 by white @xcite , because this pair of two @xmath0 spins is expected to become effectively a single @xmath18 spin in the antiferromagnetic two - leg ladder .",
    "we choose sites @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that they are located symmetrically with respect to the center of the ladder as shown in fig.[fig : corr ] as well as for the spin - pair correlation function .    in fig.[fig :",
    "sto_a1j4dep](a ) , we show values of the string correlation function for some values of @xmath57 and @xmath50 as a function of distance @xmath86 between effective spins , @xmath85 and @xmath87 . for @xmath54 , namely for the afhl , the value of @xmath88 takes about 0.3801 in range @xmath89 , where there is no effect of a short distance between @xmath85 and @xmath87 and the open boundary .",
    "this value of @xmath88 is close to the value of @xmath90 which was obtained in ref.[ref : white96 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath88 decreases as the value of @xmath1 increases .",
    "we have effect of a short distance due to small values of @xmath86 and that of open boundary for large values of @xmath86 .",
    "it should be noticed that these effects increase as the value of @xmath1 increases .",
    "decreasing behavior of @xmath88 is shown in fig.[fig : sto_a1j4dep](b ) as a function of @xmath57 by using values of @xmath91 in order to avoid these two effects .",
    "this decreasing behavior suggests that the string correlation function can vanish for @xmath92 .",
    "we investigate an asymptotic behavior of a decay of the string correlation function at @xmath50 and @xmath11 .",
    "we carry out the infinite algorithm of the dmrg method until a system size increases up to @xmath93 .",
    "we use a range of system size @xmath94 in order to avoid the short distance effect and the open boundary effect . in fig.[fig : sto_fit](a ) , values of @xmath95 are shown as a function of @xmath86 . if the string correlation function decays exponentially as the increasing distance , we should have a straight line in this figure . in fig.[fig : sto_fit](b ) , values of @xmath95 are shown as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "if the string correlation function decays algebraically as the increasing distance , we should have a straight line in this figure .",
    "comparing fig.[fig : sto_fit](a ) and fig.[fig : sto_fit](b ) , we find that a line in fig.[fig : sto_fit](b ) approximates to a straight line better than that in fig.[fig : sto_fit](a ) .",
    "hence , the string correlation function decays algebraically rather than exponentially at @xmath97 .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath97 is a critical point of a quantum phase transition .",
    "we estimate a phase boundary by searching for values of @xmath57 at which the spin gap @xmath98 vanishes for fixed values of @xmath26 . the obtained phase boundary is shown in fig.[fig : gap_inval - j4 ] in @xmath99 plane , where @xmath100 . in this @xmath99 plane ,",
    "the point ( 0,1 ) corresponds to the afhl which has a spin gap and a point ( 0,0 ) to the antiferromagnetic chain which does not have a spin gap .",
    "as @xmath26 decreases , the critical value of @xmath1 decreases . in the present study ,",
    "we are not able to conclude whether we have a finite range of @xmath1 with a finite spin gap at @xmath51 or not .",
    "a dotted line in fig.[fig : gap_inval - j4 ] shows a phase boundary estimated from the spectrum of the lowest triplet excitation by brehmer _",

    "the singlet dimers are located every rung of the ladder .",
    "their result was obtained by including terms of third order in @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "although we can not compare the results by the perturbation theory with our results by the dmrg method near the region where @xmath104 and @xmath105 , both results indicate that the gapfull region broadens as the value of @xmath106 increases .    in a region where the value of @xmath57 is lager than that of the phase boundary ,",
    "the dmrg method becomes unstable .",
    "hence it remains an open question whether we have a finite spin gap or not in that region .",
    "we have investigated a quantum phase transition for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder with the cyclic four - spin exchange interaction by using the dmrg method ; its interaction constant is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the infinite algorithm with open boundary conditions has been used in order to calculate the spin gap , the spin - pair correlation function and the string correlation function . for @xmath54 ,",
    "we have not found the gapless region by varying the value of @xmath100 .",
    "this result is consistent with the assertion given by barnes _",
    "et al . _ @xcite ; the afhl has a spin gap for all nonzero interchain interaction .",
    "on the other hand in the case of @xmath50 and @xmath107 , we have found that the spin gap vanishes at @xmath6 . at this point ,",
    "a larger value of correlation length than the system size is found by assuming exponential decay of the spin - pair correlation function .",
    "we have obtained a better fitting by assuming a power - law decay of the spin - pair correlation function .",
    "we have found that the string correlation function decays algebraically rather than exponentially at this point .",
    "these results suggest that there is the spin gap for @xmath108 and we have a quantum phase transition at @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "this is a contrast to the result that the spin gap remains finite even at phase transition points for the system with a combination of biquadratic terms , which are not related to the cyclic four spin exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the phase boundary for the @xmath99 plane and found that it is consistent with the result by the perturbation theory for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although we have obtained @xmath81 at @xmath50 and @xmath11 , estimation of critical exponents remains as a future work in order to argue the type of the critical behavior .",
