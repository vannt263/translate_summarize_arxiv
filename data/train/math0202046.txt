    "until recently , the various symmetric imprimitivity theorems in the literature have all been associated to commuting free and proper actions of two locally compact groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the left and right of a locally compact space @xmath2 .",
    "the original theorem , due to green and rieffel @xcite , says that the crossed products @xmath3 and @xmath4 are morita equivalent ; the most powerful generalizations give morita equivalences between crossed products of induced @xmath5-algebras @xcite or crossed products of @xmath6-algebras @xcite .",
    "there two ways to prove a symmetric imprimitivity theorem .",
    "the first , used in @xcite and @xcite , is to build module actions and inner products on spaces of compactly supported functions and then complete to get a bimodule over the ( complete ) crossed products ; for the green - rieffel theorem , the bimodule @xmath7 is a completion of @xmath8 . the second ,",
    "used in @xcite and @xcite , starts from the one - sided equivalence involving just one group , and bootstraps up by taking crossed products and tensor products ; for the green - rieffel theorem , we start with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the tensor product @xmath11 implements the equivalence . in applications ,",
    "the first bimodule @xmath12 is more convenient for direct calculations , and the tensor - product bimodule is useful when we want to bootstrap results from the one - sided case .",
    "it is known that the two bimodules are in fact isomorphic as imprimitivity bimodules @xcite , and this isomorphism is useful , for example , in settling questions of amenability @xcite .",
    "both constructions , though , ultimately use imprimitivity bimodules constructed from algebras of functions , and the algebraic structure in these bimodules was found by pretty much _ ad hoc _ methods . in @xcite , rieffel proposed an alternative , more systematic approach for building imprimitivity bimodules , based on abstracting the concepts of proper and free actions to the noncommutative setting .",
    "he described a family of proper saturated actions of a locally compact group @xmath13 on a non - commutative @xmath5-algebra @xmath14 for which there is a morita equivalence between the ( reduced ) crossed product @xmath15 and a generalized fixed - point algebra @xmath16 of @xmath14 ; this one - sided equivalence is implemented by a bimodule which is constructed by completing a dense subalgebra of @xmath14 in a very particular way .",
    "pask and raeburn have recently proved a symmetric imprimitivity theorem for commuting actions on the cuntz - krieger algebras of directed graphs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) , which appears to be quite independent of the machinery developed in @xcite . however , the actions considered in @xcite are proper in rieffel s sense , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) can be formulated as a morita equivalence of crossed products of generalized fixed - point algebras .",
    "it is therefore tempting to look for a symmetric imprimitivity theorem for commuting proper actions on a @xmath5-algebra , and the purpose of the present paper is to formulate and prove such a theorem .",
    "thus we consider commuting actions @xmath17 and @xmath18 of two groups on the same @xmath5-algebra @xmath14 , and aim to prove that if both actions are proper and saturated in rieffel s sense , then we have a morita equivalence between the crossed products @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we want a complete theory : we want a tensor - product bimodule which is good for bootstrapping arguments , a bimodule which is obtained by completing a dense subalgebra of @xmath14 , and an isomorphism between these bimodules .",
    "if this new symmetric imprimitivity theorem requires extra hypotheses , we want to know that the hypotheses are satisfied in the key examples .",
    "the first step is relatively straightforward . under some mild continuity hypotheses which ensure that the various crossed products make sense",
    ", we can start with two applications of rieffel s theorem from @xcite and use the usual bootstrap arguments to obtain a tensor - product bimodule ( proposition  [ prop - tensor - ib ] ) .",
    "the second and third steps are achieved in ",
    "[ concrete - result ] using the results of our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we show that the natural action of @xmath1 on the bimodule implementing the equivalence between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is proper and saturated in the sense of @xcite , and identify the generalized fixed - point algebra @xmath23 with @xmath20 , so that the main theorems of @xcite give the desired morita equivalence between @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the isomorphism with the tensor - product bimodule ( theorem  [ thm - symmetric ] and corollary  [ cor - ibm ] ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - symmetric ] raises substantial technical problems involving vector - valued integrals whose treatment we defer to two appendices .",
    "theorem  [ thm - symmetric ] requires substantial hypotheses of the sort needed by rieffel in @xcite . in the final section",
    ", we show that the hypotheses in  [ concrete - result ] are often automatically satisfied .",
    "more specifically , we show that if there is an underlying free and proper space @xmath24 such that @xmath6 maps bi - equivariantly into @xmath25 , then theorem  [ thm - symmetric ] applies .",
    "although it is a little against the spirit of rieffel s theory to assume the existence of an underlying proper action on a space , it is a fact that in all main examples of proper actions of @xmath13 there is such an underlying space @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss this in our concluding remark  [ rem - coactions ] , and also speculate on possible implications for nonabelian duality .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath18 be commuting actions of locally compact groups on a -algebra @xmath14 .",

    "* corollary 1.7 ) to @xmath28 gives a @xmath32 imprimitivity bimodule @xmath33 , where @xmath21 denotes the generalized fixed - point algebra .",

    "we use the same isomorphism @xmath52 to work out what the formula for the @xmath53-valued inner product on @xmath45 should be : @xmath54 now @xmath55 completes to give a morita equivalence between @xmath21 and @xmath40 , and for @xmath56 and @xmath57 the actions and inner products are given by @xmath58    the first step to obtaining the tensor - product version of the symmetric imprimitivity theorem is to show that the natural extension @xmath59 of @xmath29 to @xmath25 leaves @xmath21 invariant : if @xmath60 then , using , we have @xmath61 similarly , we use to show that @xmath62 these two calculations show that , algebraically at least , @xmath63 is a potential candidate for an action of @xmath1 on the @xmath64-imprimitivity bimodule @xmath41 .    to form the crossed - product bimodule , we need conditions implying that the action @xmath65 induces appropriately continuous actions @xmath66 and @xmath67 on @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
