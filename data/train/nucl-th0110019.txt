    "understanding how nuclear forces emerge from the fundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most important problems of quantum physics . to study hadron dynamics at scales where qcd is strongly coupled",
    ", it is useful to employ effective field theories ( eft s ) [ 1,2 ] , invaluable tools for computing physical quantities in the theories with disparate energy scales . following the early work of weinberg and others [ 3 - 7 ]",
    ", the eft approach has become very popular in nuclear physics [ 8,9 ] .",
    "a fundamental difficulty in an eft description of nuclear forces is that effective lagrangians which are used within its framework yield graphs which are divergent , and give rise to singular quantum - mechanical potentials .",
    "these potentials do not satisfy the requirements of ordinary quantum mechanics and need to be regulated , and renormalization must be performed . in this way",
    "one can successfully perform calculations of many quantities in nuclear physics . however , in this case one can not parametrize the interactions of nucleons , by using some lagrangian or hamiltonian . in fact , in quantum field theory , knowing the lagrangian is not sufficient to compute results for physical quantities .",
    "in addition , one needs to specify a way to make all infinite quantities finite .",
    "another consequence of this situation is that there are not any equations for renormalized amplitudes in subtractive eft s : in order to resolve this problem , in some eft s [ 6,10,11 ] finite cutoff regularization is used .",
    "however , renormalization is required to render such theories consistent , and certain cutoff - dependent terms have to be absorbed into the constants before determining them from empirical data .",
    "if the eft approach , as it is widely believed , is able to provide a fundamental description of the interactions of nucleons at low energies , one can hope that it will give rise to parametrization of these interactions by interaction operators as fundamental as the coulomb potential , that parametrizes the interaction of charged particles in low energy qed . in the quantum mechanics of particles interacting via the coulomb potential , which is an example of the effective theory , one deals with a well - defined interaction hamiltonian and the schrdinger equation governing the dynamics of the theory .",
    "this theory is self - consistent , and provides an excellent description of atomic phenomena at low energies . in light of this fact",
    "one can expect that the eft of nuclear forces will allow one to construct a well - defined operator parametrizing the interaction of nucleons and governing their dynamics . at the same time , since the eft leads to singular nucleon potentials , this operator must not be an interaction hamiltonian . in the present paper",
    "we show that recent developments in quantum theory provide the possibility of a consistent description of nucleon dynamics predicted by the eft approach .",
    "the above problem of subtractive eft s is the same that arises in any quantum field theory with uv divergences : regularization and renormalization allow one to render the physical predictions finite , however , it is impossible to construct a renormalized hamiltonian acting on the fock space , i.e. , after renormalization the dynamics of the theory is not governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "this equation is local in time , and the interaction hamiltonian describes an instantaneous interaction . on the other hand , locality is the main cause of uv divergences in quantum field theory ( qft ) , and hence regularization and renormalization may be considered as some ways of nonlocalization of the theory . in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] it has been shown that the use of the feynman approach [ 13 ] to quantum theory in combination with the canonical approach allows one to extend quantum dynamics to describe the evolution of a system whose dynamics is generated by a nonlocal - in - time interaction , and an equation of motion has been derived as the most general dynamical equation consistent with the current concepts of quantum theory .",
    "being equivalent to the schrdinger equation in the particular case where interaction is instantaneous , this equation permits the generalization to the case where the interaction operator is nonlocal in time .",
    "it has been shown [ 12 ] that a generalized quantum dynamics ( gqd ) developed in this way provides a new insight into the problem of uv divergences .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the formalism of the gqd developed in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] opens new possibilities in the effective theory of nuclear forces .",
    "we show that in leading order of the two - nucleon eft nucleon dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator . by using the example of the @xmath0 matrix that describes the contact term in leading order",
    ", we investigate the dynamical situation in an eft after renormalization .",
    "we show that this @xmath0 matrix has the properties that are completely unsatisfactory from the point of view of ordinary quantum mechanics , but satisfies the generalized dynamical equation .",
    "moreover , in this case we deal with the dynamics that is described by the model developed in refs . [ 12,14 ] as a test model demonstrating the possibility of the extension of quantum dynamics to the case of nonlocal - in - time interactions .",
    "as has been shown [ 12 ] , there are no physical reasons to restrict ourselves to the case of local interactions where the generalized dynamical equation is equivalent to the schrdinger equation : the dynamics corresponding to any solution of this equation is not at variance with the current concepts of quantum physics .",
    "this means that the situation where the dynamics is generated by nonlocal - in - time interaction is possible in principle . in the present paper",
    "we show that this possibility is realized in the case of low energy nucleon dynamics , and in leading order this dynamics is governed by a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator that is considered in the exactly solvable model [ 12,14 ] .",
    "we will show that this feature of the gqd permits the parametrization of the @xmath1 interactions by operators that are as well defined as , for example , the coulomb potential , and are independent of renormalization schemes .",
    "the advantages of the gqd is that it allows one to describe the evolution of nucleon systems in a consistent way by using equations that do not require renormalization . in the present paper",
    "this fact will be proved in leading order of the eft approach .    in sec .",
    "ii we review the principal features of the gqd . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the exactly solvable model with nonlocal - in - time interaction and its applications to the description of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum system within the eft is investigated in sec .",
    "we will consider the nucleons as spinless particles at energies much smaller than their mass , their internal excitation energy , and the range of their interaction , and will investigate nucleon dynamics within the eft approach developed in ref . [",
    "we show that in leading order this dynamics is equivalent to the dynamics of the model [ 12,14 ] with a nonlocal - in - time interaction operator .",
    "the dynamical situation that arises in an eft after renormalization is investigated in sec .",
    "v. finally , in sec .",
    "vi we present some concluding remarks .",
    "as has been shown in ref.@xcite , the schrdinger equation is not the most general dynamical equation consistent with the current concepts of quantum theory .",
    "let us consider these concepts .",
    "as is well known , the canonical formalism is founded on the following assumptions : ( i ) the physical state of a system is represented by a vector ( properly by a ray ) of a hilbert space , and ( ii ) an observable @xmath2 is represented by a hermitian hypermaximal operator @xmath3 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath4 of @xmath3 give the possible values of @xmath2 .",
    "an eigenvector @xmath5 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath4 represents a state in which @xmath2 has the value @xmath4 .",
    "if the system is in the state @xmath6 the probability @xmath7 of finding the value @xmath4 for @xmath2 , when a measurement is performed , is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projection operator on the eigenmanifold @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath11 and the sum @xmath12 is taken over a complete orthonormal set @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath15 the state of the system immediately after the observation is described by the vector @xmath16    in canonical formalism these postulates are used together with the assumption that the time evolution of a state vector is governed by the schrdinger equation . however , in qft the schrdinger equation is only of formal importance because of the uv divergences .",
    "note in this connection that in the feynman approach @xcite to quantum theory this equation is not used as a fundamental dynamical equation .",
    "as is well known , the main postulate , on which this approach is founded , is as follows : ( iii ) the probability of an event is the absolute square of a complex number called the probability amplitude .",
    "the joint probability amplitude of a time - ordered sequence of events is product of the separate probability amplitudes of each of these events .",
    "the probability amplitude of an event which can happen in several different ways is a sum of the probability amplitudes for each of these ways .",
    "the statements of assumption ( iii ) express the well - known law for the quantum - mechanical probabilities .",
    "within canonical formalism this law is derived as one of the consequences of the theory . however , in the feynman formulation of quantum theory this law is used as the main postulate of the theory .",
    "the feynman formulation also contains , as its essential idea , the concept of a probability amplitude associated with a completely specified motion or path in space - time . from assumption ( iii )",
    "it then follows that the probability amplitude of any event is a sum of the probabilities that a particle has a completely specified path in space - time .",
    "the contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose ( imaginary ) phase is the classical action ( in units of @xmath17 ) for the path in question .",
    "the above constitutes the contents of the second postulate of the feynman approach to quantum theory .",
    "this postulate is not so fundamental as assumption ( iii ) , which directly follows from the analysis of the phenomenon of quantum interference @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been shown that the first postulate of the feynman approach [ assumption ( iii ) ] can be used in combination with the main fundamental postulates of canonical formalism [ assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) ] without resorting to the second feynman postulate and the assumption that the dynamics of a quantum system is governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "such a use of the main assumptions of quantum theory leads to a more general dynamical equation than the schrdinger equation .    in a general case the time evolution of a quantum system",
    "is described by the evolution equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unitary evolution operator , @xmath20 with the group property @xmath21 here we use the interaction picture . according to assumption ( iii ) , the probability amplitude of an event which can happen in several different ways is a sum of contributions from each alternative way . in particular , the amplitude @xmath22 can be represented as a sum of contributions from all alternative ways of realization of the corresponding evolution process . dividing these alternatives into different classes",
    ", we can then analyze such a probability amplitude in different ways .",
    "for example , subprocesses with definite instants of the beginning and end of the interaction in the system can be considered as such alternatives . in this way the amplitude @xmath23 can be written in the form @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability amplitude that if at time @xmath26 the system was in the state @xmath27 then the interaction in the system will begin at time @xmath26 and will end at time @xmath28 and at this time the system will be in the state @xmath29 .",
    "note that in general @xmath30 may be only an operator - valued generalized function of @xmath26 and @xmath31 , since only @xmath32 must be an operator on the hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , it is convenient to call @xmath30 an `` operator '' , using this word in the generalized sense . in the case of an isolated system",
    "the operator @xmath30 can be represented in the form @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the free hamiltonian .    as has been shown in ref.@xcite , for the evolution operator @xmath19 given by eq .",
    "( [ repre ] ) to be unitary for any times @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the operator @xmath30 must satisfy the following equation : @xmath37 this equation allows one to obtain the operators @xmath38 for any @xmath26 and @xmath31 , if the operators @xmath39 corresponding to infinitesimal duration times @xmath40 of interaction are known .",
    "it is natural to assume that most of the contribution to the evolution operator in the limit @xmath41 comes from the processes associated with the fundamental interaction in the system under study . denoting this contribution by @xmath42 , we can write @xmath43 where @xmath44 . the parameter @xmath45 is determined by demanding that @xmath42 must be so close to the solution of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) in the limit @xmath46 that this equation has a unique solution having the behavior ( [ bound ] ) near the point @xmath47 .",

    "we will assume that condition ( [ bound ] ) means that @xmath51 for any vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the hilbert space .",
    "condition ( [ bound ] ) has to be considered in the same sense .    within gqd the operator @xmath42 plays the role the interaction hamiltonian plays in the ordinary formulation of quantum theory",

    "( [ main ] ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian dynamics in the case where the operator @xmath42 is of the form @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture . in this case",

    "( [ psi ] ) satisfies the schrdinger equation , @xmath76 the delta function @xmath77 in eq .",

    "this dynamical situation is not peculiar from the point of view of the gqd : the schrdinger equation is only a particular case of the generalized dynamical eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) where the interaction is instantaneous , and the above means that the @xmath1 interaction is nonlocal in time .",
    "it is extremely important that within gqd the eft description of low energy nucleon dynamics becomes as well founded as the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics describing atomic phenomena .",
    "in fact , in both cases the dynamics is governed by the generalized dynamical equation ( [ main ] ) , and only the interaction operators are different .",
    "since the interaction operator ( 43 ) represents only the contact component of the @xmath1 interaction , in general one has to consider it in combination with a long - range component of the interaction . in this case",

    "( [ dif ] ) and solving it numerically , one can easily obtain the @xmath0 matrix and hence the evolution operator .",
    "note that the conventional way of solving the above problem is the formal use of the potential [ 7,11 ] @xmath262 we say `` formal '' since the use of such a potential leads to uv divergencies , and the schrdinger and @xmath198 equations require regularization and renormalization . on the other hand , as we have shown , the contact interaction , which in eq .",

    "( [ dif ] ) , one can obtain the @xmath0 matrix as easily as in the case of the pure one - pion - exchange potential .",
    "thus the formalism of the gqd allows one to formulate an eft theory of nuclear forces as a self - consistent theory free from uv divergences .",
    "one of the advantages of such a formulation is that one can investigate the general consequences of the theory that have significant effects on the character of nucleon dynamics .",
    "as is well known , the dynamics of many nucleon systems depends on the off - shell properties of the two - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "for this reason , let us consider the effects of the nonlocality of the @xmath1 interaction on these properties .",
    "in the nonlocal case , the matrix elements of the evolution operator as functions of momenta do not go to zero at infinity as fast as is required by ordinary quantum mechanics , and within hamiltonian formalism this leads to ultraviolet divergences .",
    "for example , in this case the two - nucleon amplitudes @xmath222 do not go to zero fast enough to make the faddeev equation well behaved .",
    "another consequence of nonlocality in time of the @xmath1 interaction is that for fixed momenta @xmath235 and @xmath234 the matrix elements @xmath222 tend to zero as @xmath264 , while , in the local case , they tend to @xmath265 in this limit . to illustrate this ,",
    "we present in fig .",
    "4 the off - shell behavior of @xmath266 in the limit @xmath267 . thus , the nonlocality in time of the @xmath1 interaction gives rise to an anomalous off - shell behavior of the two - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "the off - shell properties of the amplitudes for the ordinary interaction operator and the operator containing the nonlocal term are qualitatively different .",
    "this is true even when the two interaction operators have approximately the same phase shifts .",
    "in leading order of the eft approach we have shown that the effective @xmath1 interaction is nonlocal in time , and low energy nucleon dynamics is governed by the dynamical eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) with the nonlocal - in - time interaction operator ( 43 ) .",
    "thus , in the case of quantum mechanics of nucleons at low energies , we deal with the non - hamiltonian dynamics that has been investigated in ref .",
    "this dynamics is described in a natural way by the gqd that , as has been shown , provides a consistent parametrization of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the leading order contact component of this interaction is parametrized by the nonlocal - in - time operator ( 43 ) .",
    "this operator is well defined , and the generalized dynamical equation with this operator does not requires regularization and renormalization .",
    "the parametrization of the @xmath1 interaction that takes into account the long - range component is represented by eq .",
    "( 51 ) .",
    "the fact that in leading order of the eft approach low energy nucleon dynamics is described by the model considered in sec .",
    "iii allows us to explain the advantages of the gqd in describing nucleon dynamics in terms of this model .",
    "as we have shown , the generalized dynamical equation permits any form factor @xmath240 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) having uv behavior ( 19 ) with @xmath268 . in the case",
    "@xmath244 , the only possible form of the interaction operator is eq .",
    "in this case we deal with the ordinary separable - potential model . in the case",
    "@xmath269 , the interaction operator must be of the form ( 31 ) , and hence the interaction generating the dynamics of the system is necessarily nonlocal in time . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 matrix is given by eq .",
    "( 32 ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can obtain the same @xmath0 matrix in another way , starting with the singular potential @xmath270 that does not make sense without renormalization , since it leads to uv divergencies . by solving the @xmath198 equation regulated in some way and performing renormalization",
    ", one can get expression ( 32 ) for the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "however , in this way one can not determine a potential describing the fundamental interaction in the system .",
    "the singular potential ( [ pot ] ) is only of formal importance for the problem under consideration .",
    "all the information contained in this potential is that the @xmath0 matrix is of the form @xmath271 with the same form factor . if the group of the evolution operators given by eq .",
    "( 45 ) had an infinitesimal generator , one could identify it with the hamiltonian . however , as we have shown in sec .",
    "v , this group has no infinitesimal generator , and hence there are no potentials that could govern the dynamics of the system after renormalization .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 matrix ( 32 ) does not satisfy the @xmath198 equation and has such properties that are at variance with the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "thus in this case we have only a calculation rule that allows one to compute results for physical quantities . on the other hand , the above problems are the cost of trying to describe the dynamics of the system after renormalization in terms of the hamiltonian formalism , despite the fact that this dynamics is non - hamiltonian . from the more general point of view provided by the gqd we see that in this case the @xmath0 matrix satisfies the generalized dynamical eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) with the nonlocal - in - time interaction operator ( 31 ) , and this operator describes the fundamental interaction generating the dynamics of the system .",
    "thus after renormalization in the theory with the potential ( [ pot ] ) we have the dynamics that , according to the gqd , must take a place in the case @xmath269 , and an example of such a theory is low energy nucleon dynamics in leading order where the singular potential is @xmath272 . within the gqd",
    "this theory is internally consistent and is as well founded as theories with ordinary potentials such as quantum mechanics describing atomic phenomena .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 matrix is well defined , and its properties satisfy the general requirements of the theory .",
    "this is not only important from the point of view of the internal consistency of the theory .",
    "only a well - founded theory provides the possibility to obtain , in a theoretical way , new knowledge , and to prove the correctness of calculations performed within its framework . the fact that in the approach based on the gqd we have the well - defined dynamical equation is a great advantage of this approach for practical calculations .",
    "this equation does not require regularization and renormalization and is as convenient for numerical calculations as the @xmath198 equation .",
    "it is important that the use of the gqd for investigating the dynamical situation in the eft of nuclear forces gives rise to a natural parametrization of the @xmath1 interaction , and uniquely determines the form of the generalized interaction operator describing the interaction of nucleons .",
    "in contrast with initial lagrangians of eft s or formal singular potentials that are produced by these lagrangians , knowing the generalized operator of the @xmath1 interaction is sufficient to compute results for physical quantities . we have obtained that in leading order the contact term of the @xmath1 interaction is parametrized by the interaction operator ( 43 ) . in the same order ( in weinberg s power counting )",
    "the @xmath1 interaction is parametrized by the operator ( [ pioper ] ) . in this way",
