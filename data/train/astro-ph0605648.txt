    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "first , we consider the time evolution around a massive star of @xmath29 in the ambient cnm ( model cnm - s41 ) as the fiducial model .",
    "figure [ fig : hev_s3_cnm ] shows the hydrodynamical evolution of the h  ii region and shell in this model .",
    "the basic time evolution is the same as that of the h  ii region in the ambient molecular material ( papers i and ii ) . when the if passes the initial strmgren radius ( @xmath30  pc ) , the sf emerges in front of the if .",
    "since the gas temperature of the ambient cnm is only @xmath31  k , the h  ii region ( @xmath32  k ) has sufficient excess pressure to drive the sf .",
    "the sf sweeps up the ambient cnm , and a dense shell is formed just around the h  ii region .",
    "the time evolution of the expansion is well approximated by , @xmath33 the characteristic length scale , @xmath34 is the initial strmgren radius , @xmath35 and timescale , @xmath36 is the dynamical time , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the uv - photon number luminosity of the central star , @xmath21 is the sound speed in the h  ii region , and @xmath39 is the ambient number density .",
    "the gas density in the shell is about 100 times as dense as the ambient cnm .",
    "the gas temperature in the shell is only @xmath40  k , which is much lower than the ambient temperature .",
    "the ambient neutral medium just outside the h  ii region is slightly warmer than that in the outermost region .",
    "this is due to photoelectric heating by the intense fuv radiation from the central star .",
    "for example , the fuv flux just outside the sf is @xmath41 at @xmath42  myr . because of the geometrical dilution , the fuv field outside the sf gradually decreases as the hii region expands .",
    "figure [ fig : ctur_s3 ] shows the time evolution of the chemical structure of the shell .",
    "the hydrogen molecules gradually accumulate in the shell , owing to the rapid reformation on the surface of dust grains .",
    "about 45% of hydrogen atoms within the shell exist as h@xmath2 molecules at @xmath43  myr , which is about the lifetime of the adopted main - sequence star . on the other hand , carbon monoxide molecules hardly form in the shell .",
    "the reason for this difference is that in this model , the column density of the shell is only @xmath44 , which corresponds to a@xmath45 .",
    "this means that the incident fuv radiation is not significantly attenuated by the dust absorption in the shell . since the dust absorption does not work , the reformed molecules are protected against fuv photons only by the self - shielding effect . in the equilibrium photodissociation region ( pdr ) where the self - shielding is dominant over the dust absorption , the column density of the hydrogen nucleon between the if and h@xmath2 dissociation front ( df ) is , @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xcite . for the accumulation of h@xmath2 molecules in the shell , @xmath48 must be smaller than the column density of the shell , which corresponds to @xmath49 . in our calculation , @xmath50 is always only a few @xmath51 at the if ( see also figure [ fig : ng ] ) , and the reformed h@xmath2 molecules are reliably self - shielded in the shell .",
    "in addition to the sufficient self - shielding in the equilibrium state , the h@xmath2 reformation timescale is sufficiently short in the shell .",
    "the reformation time is given by @xmath52 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath53  myr in the shell .",
    "therefore , equilibrium h@xmath2 abundance is achieved during the expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - shielding of co molecules is inefficient owing to the small abundance of carbon and oxygen atoms .",
    "even if h@xmath2 molecules can accumulate in the shell , co molecules can not form without sufficient @xmath54 for shielding fuv photons by the dust absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) .",
    "the shielding by h@xmath2 molecules is an effect secondary to the dust shielding .",
    "these features do not change in the h  i clouds with @xmath55 a few @xmath56 , but change in the molecular clouds , where the ambient number density is high , @xmath57 .",
    "this is well understood with the @xmath7-dependence of the column density of the shell , @xmath54 and the incident fuv flux at the if , @xmath58 at a given @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 as equation ( [ eq : nsh ] ) shows , the column density of the shell rises with the higher ambient number density .",
    "although equation ( [ eq : ffuvi ] ) shows that the incident fuv flux also increases with increasing @xmath7 , the intense fuv radiation can be shielded .",
    "since the dust attenuation works as @xmath62 , the dust shielding effect quickly becomes significant once the dust opacity of the shell , @xmath63 exceeds unity .",
    "when the h  ii region sufficiently expands in the molecular cloud , therefore , the fuv radiation can be blocked by the dust absorption , and both h@xmath2 and co molecules can accumulate in the shell ( see papers i and ii ) .    in our calculation",
    ", the swept - up cnm ( @xmath64  k ) is converted to the cold ( @xmath65  k ) partially atomic and molecular gas behind the sf .",
    "the formation mechanism of such a dense and cold shell is not understood within the framework of the isothermal sf .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : hev_s3_cnm ] shows that the shell density and temperature gradually decrease as the h  ii region expands .",
    "we can understand all these features with the equilibrium @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath7-@xmath14 curves of the neutral medium . in figure",
    "[ fig : eq_s3 ] , `` @xmath66 '' signs represent the physical states in the pre - shock region at @xmath67 , and 9  myr in our numerical simulation .",
    "this figure shows that `` @xmath66 '' sign vertically goes down with increasing time @xmath68 , which means that the pre - shock temperature and pressure decrease almost isochorically .",
    "this is because the fuv radiation field just outside the shell gradually diminishes owing to the geometrical dilution , so that the photoelectric heating becomes inefficient .",
    "since the heating timescale is much shorter than the dynamical timescale , @xmath69  myr , the thermal equilibrium is achieved at each time step . in the same figure ,",
    "`` @xmath70 '' signs represent physical states in the post - shock region at each snapshot .",
    "the upper panel shows that the gas pressure increases by about ten times across the sf .",
    "we can understand this high post - shock pressure by recalling the derivation of equation ( [ eq : rif ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rif ] ) is derived from the equation of motion of the shell , @xmath71 ( paper ii ) . in this equation , @xmath72 is the mass of the swept - up shell , @xmath73 @xmath74 is the thermal pressure in the h  ii region , @xmath75 @xmath76 is the ram pressure , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the ambient mass density .",
    "as equation ( [ eq : eos ] ) shows , the motion of the shell is controlled by the balance between the thermal and ram pressure from the inner and outer edge of the shell .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : rif ] ) , ( [ eq : pii ] ) and ( [ eq : pram ] ) , the ram pressure can be written as , @xmath79 the backward ram pressure is always greater than the forward thermal pressure by a factor of @xmath80 , and the expansion is decelerating . since the sound crossing time of the shell is much shorter than @xmath36 , the pressure within the shell smoothly connects with @xmath76 ( @xmath74 ) at the outer ( inner ) edge of the shell .",
    "therefore , the post - shock pressure is almost equal to @xmath76 at each time step .",
    "the pressurized neutral medium is not initially in the thermal equilibrium state , but going to the equilibrium state over the cooling timescale , @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath82  myr is much shorter than @xmath36 , the gas element engulfed in the shell quickly reaches the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "figure [ fig : eq_s3 ] shows that the calculated density and temperature in the post - shock region are equal to the equilibrium values for the given post - shock pressure ( @xmath83 ) and fuv field at each time step .    while the gas element is going to the new equilibrium state , the total cooling rate significantly exceeds the heating rate .",
    "the dominant cooling process for this non - equilibrium gas is the line cooling of cii  ( 157.7@xmath10 m ) .",
    "the frequency - integrated emergent intensity of this line emission is about , @xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath78 is the ambient mass density , and @xmath85 is the shock velocity . as equation ( [ eq : ine ] ) shows , the emission from the non - equilibrium cooling layer quickly diminishes as the shell decelerates . besides the non - equilibrium cooling layer just behind the sf",
    ", most of the gas within the shell is in the thermal equilibrium state , where the photoelectric heating is mainly balanced by the cii  ( 157.7@xmath10 m ) line cooling .",
    "therefore , the cii line emission also comes from the shell itself .",
    "the emergent intensity from the equilibrium shell is about , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the average cii cooling rate in the shell . as expected from equations ( [ eq : ine ] ) and ( [ eq : ie ] ) , the total cii emission is dominated by that from the shell in the thermal equilibrium , but for the very early phase of the expansion .",
    "although this far - ir cii emission could be detected , this line , an ordinary feature of the pdr , is not a good signpost of the molecular cloud formation .",
    "instead , we seek the predicted gas phase using the hisa feature in   [ sec : obs ] .    in our 1-d calculation ,",
    "the neutral medium is steadily swept up into the shell .",
    "however , some instabilities actually deform the shell and excite its internal structure .",
    "first , the dense gas layer is expected to fragment by the gravitational instability .",
    "the shell - fragmentation occurs first at the length scale of the layer thickness , with a growth timescale of @xmath88 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt @xmath89 as the simplified criterion of the gravitationally unstable layer .",
    "figure [ fig : ctur_s3 ] shows that the shell becomes gravitationally unstable soon after @xmath90  myr , when h@xmath2 molecules begin to accumulate in the shell .",
    "the typical radius and mass of the fragment are about 0.1  pc and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "if each fragment subsequently contracts , the molecular reformation will be promoted by the self - shielding of cores , owing to the increased column density .",
    "second , the compressed layer collapsing due to the significant radiative cooling just behind the sf , suffers from thermal instability @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : eq_s3 ] , we plot the evolution track of a fluid element across the sf at @xmath92  myr .",
    "the gas temperature rises up to @xmath93  k at the sf , due to compressional heating , and falls to @xmath65  k , due to the significant radiative cooling behind the sf .",
    "the timescale to settle into the new equilibrium state is about the cooling time , @xmath82  myr .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : eq_s3 ] shows that the collapsing layer evolves almost isobarically .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the isobarically collapsing layer has been explored by @xcite , and the shaded region in the lower panel of figure [ fig : eq_s3 ] represents the expected thermally unstable region with @xmath18 . note that the gas is cooling and isobarically contracting in the unperturbed state in their linear analysis . whether the small perturbation grows or not is analyzed in the evolving background state , which differs from the original analysis by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : eq_s3 ] shows that the compressed cnm becomes thermally unstable on its way to the new equilibrium state .",
    "the linear analysis shows that the layer fragments into tiny cloudlets , whose size is about tens of aus , over the timescale of @xmath94  yr @xcite .",
    "multi - dimensional numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that each fragment has some translational motion of a few km / s .",
    "this motion is driven by the pressure of the surrounding warmer , less dense region .",
    "thus , the motion is inevitably subsonic for the surrounding medium , and does not dissipate over the sound - crossing time .",
    "@xcite have suggested that this translational cloudlets motion is the origin of the observed broad line width , or `` turbulence '' in the cold clouds .",
    "our current 1-d calculations can not explain the the actual evolution of the fragmentation of the shell , which will be affected by both the thermal and gravitational instabilities .",
    "future multi - dimensional simulations of radiative - hydrodynamics will reveal the detailed nature of the fragmented shell .",
    "second , we study how time evolution changes with different central stars in the same ambient cnm .",
    "our numerical results show a clear feature ; with the higher - mass central star , the shell density is higher and the reformation of h@xmath2 molecules becomes more efficient in the shell .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : hev_s8_cnm ] presents gas - dynamical evolution around a massive star of @xmath95 ( model cnm - s12 ) .",
    "the sf emerges and sweeps up the ambient cnm , which is the same as model cnm - s41 .",
    "the shell density is 10 times as high as the ambient cnm density at @xmath42  myr , but quickly declines afterward .",
    "the shell density is always lower than that in model cnm - s41 at the same time , @xmath68 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : ng ] ) . despite the different densities of the shells , the temperature profiles in figures [ fig : hev_s3_cnm ] and [ fig : hev_s8_cnm ]",
    "are similar .",
    "this is because the fuv field outside the shell is similar among these models ( figure[fig : ng ] ) .",
    "the fuv flux just outside the sf is @xmath41 at @xmath42  myr , and gradually decreases owing to the geometrical dilution .",
    "the formation of molecules in the shell hardly occurs in model cnm - s12 .",
    "no co molecules are formed , and only less than 0.1% of h atoms is converted to h@xmath2 molecules in the shell over 10  myr . since the column density of the shell is @xmath96 , the dust absorption does not protect reformed molecules against fuv photons . as shown in equation ( [ eq : ndf ] ) ,",
    "the self - shielding becomes less efficient with the larger @xmath97 in the shell . in model cnm - s12",
    ", @xmath50 is about ten times as large as that in model cnm - s41 at the same time , @xmath68 ( also see figure [ fig : ng ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 given by equation ( [ eq : ndf ] ) exceeds the column density of the shell , and even the self - shielding of h@xmath2 molecules does not work .",
    "furthermore , if the self - shielding were efficient , h@xmath2 molecules would not form in the low - density shell .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rfm ] ) shows that the reformation timescale becomes longer than 10  myr , when the shell density is smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "the reformation timescale is so long that no equilibrium h@xmath2 abundance is achieved .",
    "we have calculated other models with different exciting stars , and found that the formation of h@xmath2 molecules is more efficient with higher - mass stars .",
    "figure [ fig : ctur_s6 ] shows the time evolution of the chemical structure of the shell around the central star of @xmath99 ( model cnm - s18 ) . in this model ,",
    "h@xmath2 molecules are slightly formed in the shell .",
    "about 6  % of swept - up hydrogen atoms are converted to h@xmath2 molecules by the time of 10  myr .",
    "we investigate why the efficiency of h@xmath2 formation depends on the mass , or uv / fuv luminosity of the central star .",
    "the key physical quantities are the ratio , @xmath100 and number density , @xmath7 , in the shell .",
    "the former reflects the efficiency of the self - shielding effect , which determines the h@xmath2 abundance in the equilibrium state , and the latter determines the reformation timescale , over which the h@xmath2 abundance becomes the equilibrium value .",
    "figure [ fig : ng ] shows the time evolution of the number density , fuv radiation field , and their ratio , @xmath50 in the shell in models cnm - s41 , s18 , and s12 , respectively . at the same time , @xmath68 , the number density is larger with higher - mass stars , and the fuv fields are similar among models .",
    "thus , their ratio , @xmath50 is smaller with a higher - mass star .",
    "the self - shielding effect is more efficient with a higher - mass central star , as equation ( [ eq : ndf ] ) shows .",
    "the higher shell density ensures that the equilibrium state is achieved over a shorter timescale , and that h@xmath2 molecules quickly accumulate in the shell with a higher - mass star .",
    "consequently , the variation in the chemical structure of the shell originates in similar and different time evolutions of @xmath12 and @xmath7 among models shown in figure [ fig : ng ] .",
    "we make use of some analytic relations to interpret these characteristic features .",
    "first , the fuv field at time @xmath68 , @xmath101 scales with the uv / fuv luminosity of the star , @xmath102 this shows that @xmath101 is normalized with the first term , @xmath103 , which is smaller with the more massive star . on the other hand , the last evolutionary term has an inverse dependence , because the dynamical time , @xmath36 is longer with the higher - mass star ( see equation ( [ eq : tdyn ] ) ) .",
    "owing to the cancellation of these opposite dependences , the time evolution of the fuv field is similar among models with different stars , as shown in figure [ fig : ng ] .",
    "next , let us consider why the shell density is larger with a higher - mass star . in   [ ssec : fid ] , we have shown that the post - shock density is determined by the fuv radiation field and gas pressure in the shell at each time step . because of the similarity in the time evolution of @xmath12 among models , only gas pressure in the shell dominates the post - shock physical state .",
    "the time evolution of the ram pressure is given by equation ( [ eq : pramt ] ) , where the dynamical time , @xmath36 is longer with the higher - mass star .",
    "therefore , thermal pressure in the shell is higher with the higher - mass star at the same time , @xmath68 , which causes a variation in shell density among models .",
    "figure [ fig : p_acrsf ] presents the time evolution of thermal pressure in both pre - shock and post - shock regions in models cnm - s41 , s18 , and s12 .",
    "since the fuv radiation field is similar , the time evolution of the pre - shock pressure is almost the same among models .",
    "the post - shock pressure is higher with the higher - mass star , as predicted by equation ( [ eq : pramt ] ) .",
    "the significant enhancement of the pressure behind the sf accounts for the high density of the shell .",
    "figure [ fig : eq_s8 ] presents several post - shock and pre - shock physical states in model cnm - s12 . in this model ,",
    "the post - shock pressure is just a little higher than the pre - shock pressure , and the shell density is significantly lower than that in model cnm - s41 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : eq_s3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the multi - dimensional structure of the shell expected to be produced by various instabilities .",
    "first , gravitational instability grows earlier in denser layers .",
    "since the shell density is higher with a higher - mass star , shell - fragmentation will occur earlier in these higher - mass models . while the shell becomes unstable at @xmath90  myr in model cnm - s41 ( figure [ fig : ctur_s3 ] ) ,",
    "it is not until @xmath104  myr that the unstable region appears in model cnm - s18 ( figure [ fig : ctur_s6 ] ) .",
    "no gravitationally unstable region appears in cnm - s12 .",

    "figure [ fig : eq_s8 ] shows the evolution track of the layer at @xmath92  myr in model cnm - s12 .",
    "the pressure rises by a factor of two or three across the sf , and the evolution track only grazes the thermally unstable region on the @xmath7-@xmath14 plane . in summary , our calculations show that h@xmath2 formation is more efficient in a model with a higher - mass star , and that the effects of gravitational / thermal instability are more significant in such higher - mass models .",
    "once the stellar uv radiation escapes from the molecular clouds and h  i clouds ( cnm ) , the h  ii region expands to the wnm .",
    "figure [ fig : hev_s3_wnm ] shows the hydrodynamical evolution of the h  ii region around a @xmath29 star in the ambient wnm ( model wnm - s41 ) . because of the low ambient number density , the h  ii region expands into a very large region of more than @xmath105  pc . as figure",
    "[ fig : hev_s3_wnm ] shows , however , the expanding h  ii region hardly affects the hydrodynamics .",
    "the gas density slightly increases by a factor of two in front of the if .",

    "the initial strmgren radius is , @xmath106  pc , and the h  ii region remains in its early formation phase at @xmath107  myr .",
    "furthermore , after the h  ii region reaches the initial strmgren radius , no dense shell is formed around the h  ii region .",
    "the ambient gas temperature is originally as high as @xmath108  k , and the pressure excess of the h  ii region over the ambient wnm is small .",
    "no sf with a high mach number ever emerges in front of the if .",
    "the ambient wnm is only converted to the ionized medium with a similar temperature and density , which is the wim .",

    "although @xcite and @xcite have shown that the highly pressurized wnm can be converted into the cnm , this is not the case with the expanding hii regions .",
    "the bubble driven by stellar - wind or supernova explosion can provide the much higher pressure even in the wnm , and triggers the phase transition from wnm to cnm ( also see ",
    "[ ssec : bubble ] ) .",
    "when the h  ii region expands in the cnm , the sf emerges in front of the if and the ambient cnm is compressed in the shell .",
    "we have shown that h@xmath2 molecules can form if the central star is more massive than @xmath109 , but co molecules seldom form in the shell .",
    "the calculated temperature and density in the shell are @xmath110 a few @xmath4 10  k and @xmath111 .",
    "this is just the gas phase intermediate between the ambient cnm and molecular clouds observed with the co emission .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to detect such an intermediate gas phase .",
    "the gas temperature is too low to thermally excite the rovibrational transition of h@xmath2 molecules .",

    "figure [ fig : hisa_w5 ] shows that such a gas phase is still possible under our constraints .",
    "second , let us evaluate the total column density in another way , using the 60- and @xmath165 dust emissions ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , the above values of @xmath169 and @xmath156 should be considered as the upper and lower limits .",
    "the future high - resolution observation at @xmath185 will provide tight constraints .",
    "in our numerical modeling , we have adopted an fuv background field of @xmath13 as the fiducial value . however , the fuv background field is generally variable with time , and sensitive to proximal massive stars @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , a stronger fuv field reduces the molecular abundance in the shell .",
    "this is because the self - shielding effect becomes inefficient with a stronger fuv background field , namely the ratio , @xmath47 becomes larger with larger @xmath12 . as expected with the equilibrium @xmath7-@xmath8 curves ( also see   [ sec : num ] ) , the shell density decreases as @xmath12 increases under the same pressure , and @xmath50 increases .",
    "we have examined some models with different fuv background fields . with @xmath18 ( 10 ) in model cnm - s41 , for example , only about 25  % ( 2  % ) of hydrogen atoms exist as h@xmath2 molecules in the shell at @xmath43  myr .",

    "the gas temperature in the shell is about 40  k ( 60  k ) with @xmath18 ( 10 ) , which is still much lower than the typical cnm temperature .",
    "this situation may be more suitable for hisa clouds around the w4 and w5 h  ii regions , because the fuv field should be higher than the local value in a massive star - forming region .",
    "inversely , the h@xmath2 abundance ratio is slightly enhanced with a weaker background field .",
    "however , the fuv field in the shell does not fall below @xmath186 owing to the fuv radiation from the central star .",
    "co molecules seldom accumulate in the shell , and the `` dark '' character of the shell does not change with a weaker background field .      in previous sections , we have seen that the expanding h  ii region sometimes triggers the formation of h@xmath2 clouds without co from the ambient neutral medium .",
    "these h@xmath2 molecules are formed on dust grains in the dense shell , and we included the reaction rate given by @xcite in our numerical calculations .",
    "however , there is still a large uncertainty on the formation rate of h@xmath2 molecules .",
    "it is not surprising that the formation rate depends on the local physical state of the ism .",
    "for example , @xcite have suggested that the formation rate should be about five times enhanced in some nearby pdrs . taking the uncertainty into account , we have calculated model cnm - s41 with different formation rates of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the adopted normal reaction rate . whereas about 45  % of h atoms are included in h@xmath2 molecules with @xmath189 , h@xmath2 fraction becomes 83  % ( 3  % ) with @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) at @xmath43  myr .",
    "since the self - shielding is the dominant process to shield the fuv radiation , the h@xmath2 abundance within the shell is somewhat sensitive to the formation rate . in spite of different h@xmath2 abundance in the shell ,",
    "however , only less than 0.1  % of c atoms are converted to co molecules in all models . as mentioned in ",
    "[ ssec : ex_cnm ] , the dust absorption of the fuv radiation with the sufficiently large @xmath54 is needed for the accumulation of co molecules .      although we have only focused on the expansion of the h  ii region in this paper , the strong stellar wind generally affects the dynamics around a main - sequence massive star .",
    "when the wind - driven bubble expands in a preexistent h  ii region , the forward sf sweeps up an ionized medium and the ionized shell forms around the hot bubble @xcite",
    ". the ionized shell observed in the w4 h  ii region ( figure [ fig : w4 ] ) may correspond to this feature . in the diffuse ambient medium of @xmath190 , however , the effect of the wind - driven bubble is not so significant as for expansion around a single star . we can easily show that the bubble pressure quickly decreases to the initial h  ii pressure , and the bubble is confined to the h  ii region @xcite .",
    "the dynamical effect of the bubble is highly enhanced when the giant bubble expands around an ob association ( superbubble ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a huge energy input is maintained over several 10  myr by the stellar winds and continuous supernova explosions .",
    "the expansion is mainly driven in the later supernova phase , and the energy input rate is @xmath191  erg / s , where @xmath192 is the number of ob stars . the time evolution of the superbubble size and pressure is given by , @xmath193 @xmath194 @xcite . in ",
    "[ ssec : ex_wnm ] , we have shown that the h  ii region causes little dynamical effect in the ambient wnm .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : psb ] ) means that the superbubble pressure can be about ten times as high as the wnm pressure with @xmath186 ( also see figure [ fig : eqil ] ) .",
    "the sf emerges owing to the high bubble pressure , and a dense shell forms around the superbubble .",
    "we can expect a shell density with an equilibrium @xmath7-@xmath8 curve , as carried out in ",
    "[ ssec : ex_cnm ] .",
    "the swept - up wnm should tend forward the equilibrium state determined by the enhanced pressure and the fuv field at each time step . adopting a post - shock pressure of @xmath195 and @xmath186 in the shell",
