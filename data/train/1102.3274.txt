    "in this paper we further explore the relation between string theory and some 4-dimensional structures such that these structures do not appear as a result of usual compactification or model - buildings in string theory .",
    "these structures are rather involved in the mathematics of string theory but they are able to encode ( in 4 dimensions ) some dynamics of branes configuration and the geometry of certain string backgrounds . at the same time , these structures are of fundamental importance for 4-dimensional physics .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we observed a correlation between d as well ns brane configurations in some backgrounds and the appearance of exotic smoothness on the topological @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0 with standard smoothness structure is part of the string background .",
    "a variation of the brane configurations induce a change of the smoothness structure , i.e. one has to consider different smoothings of the @xmath0 .",
    "but this result is the unique feature of @xmath3 holding only for @xmath4 where a variety ( actually a continuum ) of smoothings of @xmath3 must exist .",
    "in fact in any other dimension @xmath5 there exists precisely a unique standard smooth @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "physics corresponding to exotic smooth @xmath0 has been gradually exhibited since the nineties . in a recent series of papers ,",
    "new aspects important for quantum gravity are being worked out @xcite directly .",
    "the recognition of the role of exotic @xmath0 in string theory relies so far on the following steps :    * standard smooth @xmath0appears as a part of a exact string background ; * the process of changing the exotic smoothness on @xmath0 is capable to encode the change in the configuration of specific d or ns branes @xcite . *",
    "all exotic @xmath0 s appearing in this setup are _ small exotic @xmath0 s _ , i.e. a small exotic @xmath0 embeds smoothly in the standard smooth @xmath0 as open subsets .",
    "thus , string configurations can be expressed inherently in terms of 4-dimensional structures , i.e. exotic smooth @xmath0 s are complex enough to encode some string configurations .",
    "particularly all these phenomena disappear when one changes the smoothness to the standard one .    in this paper",
    "we consider the quantum regime of d - branes in string theory .",
    "especially the correct setup for quantum branes is an open problem .",
    "however a natural proposal is the consideration of ( non - commutative ) @xmath1-algebras replacing ( classical , submanifold - like ) branes as well manifold spacetime . in the context of @xmath1-algebras",
    "there are many important counterparts of differential - geometric results including poincar duality , characteristic classes or the riemann - roch theorem .",
    "especially one obtains a generalized formula for charges of quantum d - branes @xcite .",
    "the basic technical ingredient of the analysis of small exotic @xmath0 s is the relation between exotic ( small ) @xmath0 s and non - cobordant codimension-1 foliations of @xmath2 as well gropes and wild embeddings as shown in @xcite .",
    "the foliation of the 3-sphere is classified by the godbillon - vey class as element of the cohomology group @xmath6 . by using the @xmath7-gerbes it was possible to interpret the integral elements @xmath8 as characteristic classes of a @xmath7-gerbe over @xmath2 @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will explain the whole complex of ideas more carefully .",
    "then we present some facts and definitions of k - homology and kk - theory used to introduce stable d - branes as k - theory classes in terms of tachyons condensation .",
    "these k - theory classes can be naturally described by use of k - string theory ( e.g. @xcite ) . furthermore there is a canonical interpretation for spectral triples including tachyon fields .",
    "this correspondence is further developed into the realm of noncommutative @xmath1-algebras , following e.g. @xcite , in section [ sub : branes - on - separable ] .",
    "now a natural interpretation of quantum stable d - branes is given by branes on the @xmath1-algebra .",
    "in fact a categorical description is necessary for an understanding of quantum d - branes : objects are quantum d - branes and the morphisms in the category are kk - theory classes .",
    "then in section [ sec : exotic  and - branes ] we explore the notion of stable d - branes in the convolution non - commutative algebra of the foliations representing exotic @xmath0 s . in section [ sub :",
    "net - of - exotic ] we establish the ( partial ) correspondence between stable d - branes as above and the net of exotic smooth @xmath0 s embedded in some exotic @xmath0 .",
    "a discussion of the results closes the paper .",
    "the main line of the topological argumentation can be briefly described as follows :    1 .   in bizacas exotic @xmath0",
    "one starts with the neighborhood @xmath9 of the akbulut cork @xmath10 in the k3 surface @xmath11 .",
    "the exotic @xmath0 is the interior of @xmath9 .",
    "this neighborhood @xmath9 decomposes into @xmath10 and a casson handle representing the non - trivial involution of the cork .",
    "3 .   from the casson",
    "handle we construct a grope containing alexanders horned sphere .",
    "4 .   akbuluts construction gives a non - trivial involution , i.e. the double of that construction is the identity map .",
    "5 .   from the grope",
    "we get a polygon in the hyperbolic space @xmath12 .",
    "this polygon defines a codimension-1 foliation of the 3-sphere inside of the exotic @xmath0 with an wildly embedded 2-sphere , alexanders horned sphere @xcite .",
    "finally we get a relation between codimension-1 foliations of the 3-sphere and exotic @xmath0 .",
    "now we will explain the details in this construction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an exotic @xmath0 is a topological space with @xmath13topology but with a different ( i.e. non - diffeomorphic ) smoothness structure than the standard @xmath14 getting its differential structure from the product @xmath15 . the exotic @xmath0 is the only euclidean space @xmath3 with an exotic smoothness structure .",
    "the exotic @xmath0 can be constructed in two ways : by the failure to arbitrarily split a smooth 4-manifold into pieces ( large exotic @xmath0 ) and by the failure of the so - called smooth h - cobordism theorem ( small exotic @xmath0 ) . here",
    "we will use the second method .    consider the following situation : one has two topologically equivalent ( i.e. homeomorphic ) , simple - connected , smooth 4-manifolds @xmath16 , which are not diffeomorphic .",
    "there are two ways to compare them .",
    "first one calculates differential - topological invariants like donaldson polynomials @xcite or seiberg - witten invariants @xcite .",
    "but there is another possibility : it is known that one can change a manifold @xmath11 to @xmath17 by using a series of operations called surgeries .",
    "this procedure can be visualized by a 5-manifold @xmath18 , the cobordism .",
    "the cobordism @xmath18 is a 5-manifold having the boundary @xmath19 .",
    "if the embedding of both manifolds @xmath16 in to @xmath18 induces homotopy - equivalences then @xmath18 is called an h - cobordism .",
    "furthermore we assume that both manifolds @xmath16 are compact , closed ( no boundary ) and simply - connected . as freedman @xcite showed a h cobordism implies a homeomorphism , i.e. h - cobordant and homeomorphic are equivalent relations in that case . furthermore , for that case the mathematicians @xcite are able to prove a structure theorem for such h - cobordisms : + _ let @xmath18 be a h - cobordism between @xmath16 .",
    "then there are contractable submanifolds @xmath20 together with a sub - cobordism @xmath21 with @xmath22 , so that the h - cobordism @xmath23 induces a diffeomorphism between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "_ + thus , the smoothness of @xmath11 is completely determined ( see also @xcite ) by the contractible submanifold @xmath10 and its embedding @xmath26 determined by a map @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29(@xmath30 is an involution ) .",
    "one calls @xmath10 , the _ akbulut cork_. according to freedman @xcite , the boundary of every contractible 4-manifold is a homology 3-sphere .",
    "this theorem was used to construct an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "then one considers a tubular neighborhood of the sub - cobordism @xmath31 between @xmath10 and @xmath32 .",
    "the interior @xmath33 ( as open manifold ) of @xmath31 is homeomorphic to @xmath0 . if ( and only if ) @xmath11 and @xmath17 are homeomorphic , but non - diffeomorphic 4-manifolds then @xmath34 is an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "as shown by bizaca and gompf @xcite one can use @xmath33 to construct an explicit handle decomposition of the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "we refer for the details of the construction to the papers or to the book @xcite .",
    "the idea is simply to use the cork @xmath10 and add some casson handle @xmath35 to it .",
    "the interior of this construction is an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we have to consider the casson handle and its construction in more detail . briefly , a casson handle @xmath35 is the result of attempts to embed a disk @xmath36 into a 4-manifold . in most cases this attempt fails and",
    "casson @xcite looked for a substitute , which is now called a casson handle .",
    "freedman @xcite showed that every casson handle @xmath35 is homeomorphic to the open 2-handle @xmath37 but in nearly all cases it is not diffeomorphic to the standard handle @xcite .",
    "the casson handle is built by iteration , starting from an immersed disk in some 4-manifold @xmath11 , i.e. a map @xmath38 with injective differential .",
    "every immersion @xmath38 is an embedding except on a countable set of points , the double points .",
    "one can kill one double point by immersing another disk into that point .",
    "these disks form the first stage of the casson handle . by iteration",
    "one can produce the other stages .",
    "finally consider not the immersed disk but rather a tubular neighborhood @xmath39 of the immersed disk , called a kinky handle , including each stage .",
    "the union of all neighborhoods of all stages is the casson handle @xmath35 .",
    "so , there are two input data involved with the construction of a @xmath35 : the number of double points in each stage and their orientation @xmath40",
    ". thus we can visualize the casson handle @xmath35 by a tree : the root is the immersion @xmath38 with @xmath41 double points , the first stage forms the next level of the tree with @xmath41 vertices connected with the root by edges etc .",
    "the edges are evaluated using the orientation @xmath40 .",
    "every casson handle can be represented by such an infinite tree .",
    "the main idea is the construction of a grope , an infinite union of surfaces with non - vanishing genus , from the casson handle .",
    "but the grope can be represented by a sequence of polygons in the two - dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath12 .",
    "this sequence of polygons is replaced by one polygon with the same area . from this polygon",
    "we can construct a codimension - one foliation on the 3-sphere as done by thurston @xcite .",
    "this 3-sphere is part of the boundary @xmath42 of the akbulut cork @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore one can show that the codimension - one foliation of the 3-sphere induces a codimension - one foliation of @xmath42 so that the area of the corresponding polygons agree .",
    "thus we are able to obtain a relation between an exotic @xmath0 ( of bizaca as constructed from the failure of the smooth h - cobordism theorem ) and codimension - one foliation of the @xmath2 .",
    "two non - diffeomorphic exotic @xmath0implying non - cobordant codimension - one foliations of the 3-sphere described by the godbillon - vey class in @xmath6 ( proportional to the are of the polygon ) .",
    "this relation is very strict , i.e. if we change the casson handle then we must change the polygon .",
    "but that changes the foliation and vice verse .",
    "finally we obtained the result : + _ the exotic @xmath0 ( of bizaca ) is determined by the codimension-1 foliations with non - vanishing godbillon - vey class in @xmath43 of a 3-sphere seen as submanifold @xmath44 .",
    "we say : the exoticness is localized at a 3-sphere inside the small exotic @xmath0 . _",
    "in this and subsequent sections we want to show that d - branes of string theory are related to exotic smooth @xmath0 s also beyond the semi - classical limit , i.e. in the quantum regime of the theory where one should deal rather with _",
    "quantum branes_. what are _ quantum branes , _ is still in general an open and hard problem .",
    "one appealing proposition , relevant for this paper , is to consider branes in noncommutative spacetimes rather than on commutative manifolds or orbifolds .",
    "this leads to abstract d - branes in general noncommutative separable @xmath1 algebras as counterparts for quantum d - branes .",
    "the way from d - branes as submanifolds or k - homology classes and spaces to k - theory cycles , spectral triples and @xmath1 algebras is presented in the following subsections .",
    "the description of systems of stable dp - branes of iia , b string theories via k - theory of topological spaces can be extended toward the branes in noncommutative @xmath1 algebras .",
    "a direct string representation of the algebraic and k - theoretic ideas can be best explained in k - matrix string theory where tachyons are elements of the spectral triple representing the noncommutative geometry of the world - volumes for the configurations of branes @xcite .",
    "first let us consider the case of a vanishing @xmath45-field .",
    "the charges of d - branes are classified by suitable k - theory groups , i.e. @xmath46 in iib and @xmath47 in iia string theories , where @xmath48 is the background manifold . on the other hand ,",
    "world - volumes of dp - branes correspond to the cycles of k - homology groups , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , which are dual to the @xmath51 theory groups .",
    "let us see how k - cycles correspond to the configurations of d - branes .",
    "a k - cycle on @xmath48 is a triple @xmath52 where @xmath11 is a compact @xmath53 manifold without boundary , @xmath54 is a complex vector bundle on @xmath11 and @xmath55 is a continuous map .",
    "the topological k - homology @xmath56 is the set of equivalence classes of the triples @xmath52 respecting the following conditions :    * @xmath57 when there exists a triple ( bordism of the triples ) @xmath52 such that @xmath58 is isomorphic to the disjoint union @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the reversed @xmath53 structure of @xmath61 and @xmath11 is a compact @xmath53 manifold with boundary .",

    "@xmath64 is even dimensional sphere bundle on @xmath11 , @xmath65 projection , @xmath66 is a vector bundle on @xmath64 which gives the generator of @xmath67 on every @xmath68 over each @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the topological k - homology defined above has an abelian group structure where the sum is the disjoint union of cycles .",
    "the triples @xmath52 with @xmath11 of even dimension determines @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 corresponds to odd dimensions of @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath56 decomposes into a direct sum of abelian groups :    @xmath70 k - homology is dual to k - theory and the decomposition of @xmath71 is a direct consequence of bott periodicity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now one can interpret the cycles @xmath52 as d - branes @xcite : @xmath11 is the world - volume of the brane , @xmath54 the chan - paton bundle on it and @xmath72 gives the embedding of the brane into the ( background ) spacetime @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 has to wrap the @xmath73 manifold @xcite and @xmath50 classifies stable d - branes configurations in iib , and @xmath49 in iia , string theories .",
    "the equivalences of k - cycles as formulated in the conditions ( i)-(iii ) correspond to natural relations for d - branes @xcite .",
    "the topological k - homology theory above can be obtained analytically ( analytic k - homology theory ) .",

    "in this paper we give further evidences that string theory is indeed related to 4-dimensional nonstandard smoothness of open manifolds like @xmath0 .",
    "our concern here was the quantum limit of d - branes .",

    "these two - facets of exotic @xmath0 , namely the @xmath1 algebraic and smooth ( sub)manifold , are crucial for exhibiting the full range of a correspondence to string theory .",

    "thus , one could in some important cases translate stringy situations into 4-smooth setting and conversely and this is not a duplicate of existing approaches in string theory .",
    "thus we gain the additional and independent channel leading to 4-dimensions from string theory .",
    "the crucial is whether this 4-dimensional data carry information on physics in 4-dimensions .",
    "this important point was considered already in a series of research papers @xcite as well in a textbook @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that exotic smoothness of an open 4-region in spacetime have the same effect as the existence of magnetic monopoles , i.e. exotic smoothness induces the quantization condition for the electric charge .",
    "moreover , one can consider exotic @xmath0 s as quantum object , i.e. the spacetime induces the quantization processes @xcite .",
    "however , the full - fledged presentation of the relation of exotic @xmath0 , and other open smooth 4-manifolds , with string theory is out of reach for the authors at present .",
    "we think that new analytical and topological tools are needed . in the forthcoming paper",
    "we will present an effort into this direction and try to understand quantum branes as a kind of wild embeddings based on the smoothness of 4-manifolds .",
    "thus the point of the question , , is it possible that string theory deals with 4-dimensional structures directly neither by implementing compactifications nor by phenomenological models - building , and these structures would have a physical meaning ?  should be further explored and studied . as we emphasized in the previous paper @xcite this effort should help with understanding both 4-dimensional physics as appearing from string theory and exotic open 4-manifolds in mathematics @xcite .",
