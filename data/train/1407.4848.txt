    "magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) belongs to particularly intensely investigated subjects within physics of magnetic systems@xcite , mainly owing to its high potential for applications in modern and highly expected solid - state refrigeration and for construction of energy - saving devices .",

    "such approaches are very successful from the practical point of view , enabling for example extrapolation of the experimental results and allowing for construction of universal dimensionless functions @xcite .",
    "however , they are not free from some empirical parameters . on the other hand , also monte carlo simulations are used to predict theoretically the magnetocaloric properties of materials @xcite .",

    "also , mce in vicinity of the compensation temperature has been a subject of studies @xcite .",
    "we mention that the coexistence of normal and inverse mce is in general possible in a class of magnets exhibiting rich structure of the ground - state phase diagram , in particular in ising - heisenberg chains @xcite or even some zero - dimensional structures @xcite .",

    "motivated by the findings connected with normal and inverse mce in layered magnets , we present a theoretical study of a magnetic spin-1/2 multilayer with antiferromagnetic interlayer couplings .",
    "we assume that the planes a and b forming multilayer are magnetically non - equivalent , having different exchange parameters and different anisotropy . moreover , one of the plane ( that one which is magnetically stronger ) is randomly diluted .",
    "in such a system the compensation phenomenon can occur , whose characteristic compensation temperature can be much lower than the nel temperature , and can be modified by the degree of dilution @xcite . since in the vicinity of compensation temperature the inverse mce can be expected , the temperature range of occurrence of this effect ( and its strength ) could be , to some extent , controlled by the dilution parameter , even though the other material parameters ( exchange integrals ) remain constant .",

    "it is visible that for large concentrations of magnetic component in plane b , e.g. @xmath83 , the line separating two phases is strongly inclined and the critical value of @xmath84 is very sensitive to intralayer coupling @xmath85 .",

    "let us first analyse the dependence of total magnetization on the temperature for two distinct points of the phase diagram , corresponding either to the case with compensation or without compensation . for illustration ,",
    "the system with all - ising couplings was selected .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) presents the influence of the external magnetic field which , in the ground state , is chosen as opposite to the total magnetization , on the temperature dependence of this magnetization .",
    "the system parameters correspond here to occurrence of compensation phenomenon ( weak interlayer coupling @xmath84 and weak intralayer coupling @xmath85 ) for quite low concentration @xmath12 .",
    "it should be explained here that in the external magnetic field equal to zero ( @xmath78 ) the system possesses up - down symmetry .",
    "this means that there exist two solutions for the total magnetization , which are of the same magnitude but have opposite sign .",
    "according to landau theory of phase transitions , these symmetrical solutions correspond to the same energy , and in the ground state they are separated by the energy maximum .",
    "the presence of this separating maximum opens the possibility to apply a small external magnetic field , oriented parallel or antiparallel to the total magnetization , without changing the magnetization direction in the ground state .",
    "however , when the field is applied , the energy becomes asymmetric vs. total magnetization , and , for instance , the solution ( @xmath90 ) which is opposite to the field ( @xmath77 ) corresponds to a metastable state . in this case , when the field increases and reaches its critical value , the spin - flip transition takes place and the total magnetization becomes re - oriented parallel to the field . after this transition , which is of the 1-st order ,",
    "the signs of @xmath91 and @xmath15 are the same , and the system falls into the stable state , where the gibbs energy is in its absolute minimum . taking this into account , we think that such a kind of transition from metastable to stable states becomes interesting for studies in the context of mce .",
    "to begin with , the temperature behaviour of total magnetization should be calculated .",
    "it is known , that temperature itself does not change the symmetry of the gibbs potential , however , it diminishes the energy barrier between metastable and stable states . thus , increasing temperature enables the spin - flip transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) the dependence @xmath92 for the fields @xmath93 indicate the compensation at the temperature @xmath94 , which shifts to lower values when @xmath15 increases .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) shows the dependence of the compensation temperature on the external magnetic field and proves the linear type of dependence @xmath95 up to some critical field @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath15 approaches this critical value , the reorientation of the magnetization direction becomes increasingly abrupt . above the critical magnetic field ,",
    "the compensation vanishes and magnetization becomes a monotonous , decreasing function of temperature , with a kink in the vicinity of former compensation temperature .",
    "however , this kink disappears fast when @xmath15 further increases .    if the intralayer interaction @xmath85 becomes strong , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) , the qualitative behaviour of magnetization vs. temperature changes . let us remind that no magnetic compensation is predicted for that range of parameters . below the critical field the total magnetization first rises and then drops with temperature , but always keeps the same sign .",
    "if the critical field @xmath97 is exceeded , again the magnetization dependence on temperature becomes monotonous and bears similarity to the previous case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "the behaviour of total magnetization can be explained in details by focusing on magnetizations of both types of magnetic planes , a and b. their temperature dependences for representative parameters are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "first let us analyse the behaviour of the system in the parameter range for which compensation occurs , just below the critical magnetic field @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) ) . in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) such situation corresponds to the metastable state , where at low temperature both planes indicate magnetizations oriented antiferromagnetically , and the total magnetization is opposite to the external field .",
    "magnetization of plane a , with weaker intraplanar couplings that plane b , has rectangular - like temperature dependence and abruptly reaches very low values close to the compensation temperature . in the vicinity of this temperature @xmath99",
    "varies quasi - linearly and changes its orientation to parallel to @xmath100 at the temperature slightly higher than @xmath94 .",
    "the magnetization of plane b is almost constant in that temperature range and starts to decrease for temperatures significantly higher than compensation temperature .",
    "moreover , it keeps the same orientation for all temperatures .    for external magnetic field exceeding @xmath98 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) , the situation changes qualitatively , since no compensation occurs .",
    "starting from the lowest temperatures , both magnetizations , @xmath99 and @xmath100 indicate parallel orientation .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath100 is very similar to the previous case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath99 again shows rectangular - like thermal dependence for low temperatures .",
    "however , after the drop to low values , it remains constant in some range of temperatures in the vicinity of former @xmath94 .",
    "then it increases slightly for higher temperatures .",
    "therefore , for the set of parameters allowing for compensation at fields @xmath15 low enough , the behaviour of the total magnetization with abrupt change at some temperature close to @xmath94 is due to reorientation of the magnetization of plane a , which is characterized by weaker intraplanar couplings than plane b and no dilution .",
    "the situation is different for the set of parameters for which the phenomenon of compensation does not take place at any temperature and magnetic field , what is the content of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "below the critical magnetic field @xmath97 , it is the diluted plane b which indicates a rectangular - like temperature dependence of magnetization , with a plateau at intermediate temperatures and change of orientation . in principle",

    "[ fig : fig4](a ) , but with roles of a and b planes being swapped .",
    "exactly the same comment applies to the case of the stronger external field , exceeding the critical value , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](d ) . in both figures ,",
    "the magnetization of undiluted plane has weaker temperature dependence and constant sign .",
    "the reorientation transition concerns the plane b with dilution , and since the absolute value of magnetization is reduced with respect to plane a , no change of sign is visible in the total magnetization of the system .",
    "the main quantity the knowledge of which allows to predict the magnetocaloric properties is the magnetic entropy as a function of temperature and external magnetic field .",

    "it is evident that for lower temperatures , a distinct range of inverse magnetocaloric effect exists , which converts into normal magnetocaloric effect when the temperature is elevated .",
    "the minimum in entropy change corresponding to strongest invesre mce is quite sensitive to coupling @xmath85 , since it becomes more shallow and significantly shifts towards higher temperatures when the interplanar coupling increases . at the same time ,",
    "slight shift in the position of the maximum corresponding to normal mce is also observed , and its magnitude is strongly reduced when @xmath85 tends to the critical value at which the compensation phenomenon vanishes .",
    "at that point normal mce completely disappears and only a pronounced minimum reflecting inverse mce exists .",
    "the situation changes when @xmath85 exceeds the critical value . just above the critical coupling ,",
    "it is the inverse mce that totally disappears , leaving only a broad maximum corresponding to normal mce exactly at the position of the former negative mce minimum .",
    "actually the maximum resembles a mirror reflection of that minimum .",
    "when intraplanar coupling in plane a increases further , the mentioned maximum tends to vanish and at the same time a peak of normal mce builds up at higher temperatures . for very strong @xmath85 , we deal again with a shallow minimum ( inverse mce ) at low temperatures and a pronounced , sharp maximum ( normal mce ) at higher temperatures .",
    "if the interplanar couplings take isotropic heisenberg form , the behaviour of mce is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , for concentration @xmath83 and @xmath112 .",
    "the qualitative features are quite similar to that observed for purely ising interactions ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) . again , if the interaction parameters are such that compensation phenomenon occurs , then a low - temperature range of inverse mce and high - temperature range of normal mce is present .",
    "if the coupling @xmath85 increases , the high - temperature maximum tends to disappear and inverse mce minimum shifts towards higher temperatures and becomes less pronounced . after crossing the critical value of @xmath113 , for which compensation disappears",
    ", the high - temperature peak of normal mce rebuilds .",
    "however , the low - temperature range of inverse mce does not vanish in the vicinity of critical @xmath85 , as it was observed for ising interactions .",
    "some shallow minimum for lowest temperatures survives and gradually extends towards higher temperatures without considerable change in magnitude when @xmath85 rises .",
    "therefore , inverse mce appears slightly more robust for heisenberg intraplanar couplings than for all - ising interactions .",
    "both cases of intraplanar couplings ( ising or isotropic heisenberg ) are compared for the same interaction parameter @xmath109 and concentration @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the plots present the entropy change as a function of the temperature for weak ( @xmath115 ) and strong ( @xmath116 ) intraplanar interaction within plane a. the former value corresponds to the case with compensation for both interaction anisotropies , while the latter implies no compensation phenomenon .",
    "in general , the qualitative shape of the functions for ising and isotropic heisenberg couplings is analogous .",
    "the extrema for isotropic coupling are less pronounced and occur for lower temperatures compared to the ising couplings .    in order to complete the study",
    ", we also analyse the behaviour of another magnetocaloric quantity of interest , namely , the adiabatic cooling rate @xmath117 .",
    "its temperature dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] for various strengths of interplanar antiferromagnetic coupling . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](a ) corresponds to the presence of compensation ( at zero field ) , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](b ) the compensation is absent .",
    "the ranges of interaction parameters are the same as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] showing the temperature dependence of isothermal entropy change , while the external magnetic field is set to @xmath118 .",
    "the general qualitative behaviour of @xmath117 is quite similar to the behaviour of @xmath76 quantity . for weaker interplanar couplings ( case with possible compensation ) , for low temperatures a pronounced inverse mce",
    "is seen , with the tendency of shifting of the minimum towards higher temperatures with the increase of @xmath84 interaction . on the contrary ,",
    "maximum corresponding to normal mce tends to reduce its magnitude completely when interplanar interaction becomes stronger .",
    "close to the boundary between phase with and without compensation ( in zero field ) , the value of cooling ratio remains almost constant ( and corresponds to normal mce ) above the critical temperature , whereas below a range of inverse mce is present .",
    "for the case of absence of compensation , for interplanar couplings strong enough , the inverse mce is absent in any temperature range .",
    "further increase in @xmath84 causes the maximum to build up again ( with strong shift towards higher temperatures ) . in parallel",
    ", a range of inverse mce is recovered at low temperatures .",
    "the described changes mimic the behaviour of @xmath76 to large extent ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to follow the evolution of the entropy change magnitude when the amplitude of the external magnetic field @xmath15 is changed .",
    "such dependencies are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] and  [ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "first of them concerns the case of the multilayer with strong intraplanar interactions in plane a , thus it is prepared for the system exhibiting no compensation phenomenon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a , b ) ) . for the range of external fields not exceeding the critical field of @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a ) ) , a low - temperature , broadened minimum of inverse mce and a sharp high - temperature maximum of normal mce occur . when external field @xmath15 amplitude increases",
    ", the magnitudes of both extrema also increase and remain somehow comparable .",
    "the high - temperature maximum has quite stable position , while the low - temperature minimum tends to shift to lower temperatures . if the field amplitude exceeds the critical field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](b ) ) , the situation changes .",
    "namely , the inverse mce range tends to decrease its magnitude and then vanishes completely , so that only a single maximum ( showing normal mce ) remains .",
    "this maximum increases in magnitude monotonously when @xmath15 rises .",
    "therefore , the inverse mce is present only for a limited range of external fields @xmath15 .    if the system is in regime of parameters with compensation , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a , b ) , the situation is qualitatively similar .",
    "however , below the critical magnetic field ( @xmath98 in this case ) , the inverse mce dominates over normal mce when the magnitude of the effect is taken into account , as the low - temperature minimum becomes very deep ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a ) ) .",
    "however , above the critical field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) ) , this low - temperature range of inverse mce again tends to vanish completely , while the high - temperature maximum builds up monotonously .",
    "for @xmath15 large enough , a low - temperature minimum transforms into a kind of maximum or kink , the position of which corresponds to increasingly higher temperatures and finally tends to merge with the main maximum .",
    "we can conclude that for that choice of interaction parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a ) ) the inverse mce is more pronounced , but occurs in a more narrow range of field amplitudes @xmath15 , whereas for larger fields a more broad maximum of normal mce emerges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) ) .    in order to illustrate the influence of the magnetic dilution of plane b on the magnetocaloric properties , we show fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12](a ) isothermal entropy change between @xmath118 and @xmath120 is plotted against concentration of magnetic component in plane b for three normalized temperatures , while fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12](b ) shows analogous dependence of normalized isentropic cooling rate @xmath117 at @xmath118 .",
    "let us mention that for zero magnetic field , for @xmath121 magnetic compensation is absent , while for @xmath122 the compensation phenomenon takes place ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ) .",
    "it is visible that for the highest considered temperature , the mce remains normal in the whole range of concentrations ( for both studied magnetocaloric quantities ) and achieves a pronounced maximum when this particular temperature becomes the critical temperature of the system . for the lower temperature ,",
    "the mce is an inverse one for high concentrations @xmath12 .",
    "dilution causes the effect of switching to a normal one . for",
    "the lowest studied temperature , again entropy change and cooling rate are negative for high @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath12 is reduced , they change sign in a discontinuous way while crossing the boundary between phase without and with compensation . for lower concentrations",
    "they reach a minimum and then increase significantly .",
    "this plot supports the statement that for high temperatures the mce in a studied system is a normal one , with a maximum corresponding to the critical temperature . on the other hand , for low temperatures , the effect is inverse for the phase with compensation and",
    "can be switched to normal one by crossing the boundary towards the phase where the compensation is absent .",
    "in the paper , the coexistence of normal and inverse mce has been analysed for a magnetic multilayer with antiferromagnetic interlayer couplings and selective dilution of one kind of inequivalent magnetic planes .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model was described within pair approximation method , which is superior to the commonly applied molecular field approximation in characterization of magnetocaloric properties @xcite . in particular , it takes into account the interaction anisotropy in spin space , allowing to distinguish between ising and isotropic heisenberg couplings , which is beyond the scope of molecular field - based description .",
    "moreover , the method provides a nontrival description of diluted magnets @xcite , including a nonzero critical concentration and nonlinear dependence of the critical temperature on magnetic component concentration . within the accepted approach to the thermodynamics ,",
    "the phase diagram and the conditions for occurrence of magnetic compensation phenomenon ( the concentration of magnetic component as well as inter- and intraplanar couplings ) were discussed for the system in question .",
    "the presence of normal as well as inverse mce has been found in isothermal entropy change .",
    "it was found that the inverse mce may be present for the temperatures lower than normal mce , mainly in the range of parameters for which the compensation is possible . very close to the boundary between the phase with and without compensation , it is possible to observe only the inverse mce or only the normal mce , depending on the side from which the boundary is approached .",
    "the existence of inverse mce is limited by the amplitude of the external magnetic field , since the increase of the field amplitude first enhances and then reduces inverse mce , finally promoting only the normal mce .",
    "it should be stressed that for the cases embracing compensation phenomenon we studied only the most interesting case , namely , where the external field enforces the existence of metastable states .",
    "these states undergo discontinuous transition to stable solutions above some critical field values .",
    "the first - order transitions are accompanied by the pronounced changes in all magnetic properties , and their description was possible on the basis of the expression for the gibbs energy .",
    "this possibility can be regarded as an advantage of the method .",
    "the studies of other possible situations in the external field still should be done , for instance , when exclusively stable solutions in the ground state are taken into account .",
    "such studies require further extensive numerical calculations and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the presented results allow for indicating the range of parameters of the model for which either both effects or just one of them can be observed as a function of the temperature .",
    "moreover , they show how the mce is sensitive and how it can be controlled by varying magnetic interactions and concentration of magnetic atoms in layered system .",
    "this is vital in the context of possible design and optimization of multilayer ferrimagnets to achieve desired magnetocaloric properties .",
    "moreover , the formalism could be extended for example to the case of more than two uniform magnetic subsystems or to systems with long - range interactions .",
    "this work has been supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education on a special purpose grant to fund the research and development activities and tasks associated with them , serving the development of young scientists and doctoral students .",
