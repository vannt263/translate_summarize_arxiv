    "if , as generally reasoned , grb emissions originate from a fireball that ejects either a single blast wave into inhomogeneous surroundings or expels a long - lasting relativistic wind , then a central problem in grb studies is to understand the nature of the central engine and how it powers the energy released into the blast wave .",
    "the favored , but by no means proven scenario is that grbs are powered by the core collapse of a massive star to a black hole . the short events ( i.e. , @xmath28 s in fig .",

    "a massive star origin for grbs is in accord with the vigorous star formation implied by the blue galaxy hosts , the evidence for large quantities of gas and dust in grb environs , and the coincidence of grb directions with the disk and central regions of host galaxies .",
    "the degree of grb blast - wave collimation remains a crucial unknown .",
    "neither compact object coalescence scenarios nor collapsar / hypernova models invoking neutrino annihilation or poorly quantified mhd processes make sufficient fireball energy to account for the largest measured grb energies without invoking opening half - angles @xmath29 ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "easing the energy requirements is a great boon to these and other models .",
    "a third open question is whether the prompt grb emission results from collisions between a succession of shells ejected from the grb engine @xcite or is instead due to an esm where a single impulsive relativistic blast wave interacts with inhomogeneities in the external medium @xcite .",

    "this can restrict some forms of the internal shock model @xcite , with implications for neutrino production by grbs .",

    "the use of gamma - ray astronomy to infer properties of the expanding outflow will be well utilized by future agile and glast observations in the 100 mev - gev range , and also potentially from @xmath65 - 1 tev emission observed with ground - based air or water erenkov telescopes .",
    "a minimum of nine parameters enter into a blast - wave model calculation for grbs in the esm ( for details and references on the next 2 sections , see @xcite ) .",
    "these can be grouped according to whether they are ( i ) intrinsic parameters associated with the properties of the central engine , ( ii ) environmental parameters that characterize the surrounding medium , or ( iii ) microscopic parameters that define the reinjection of swept - up hadron power into the nonthermal leptons in the blast wave .",
    "the three intrinsic parameters are the directional energy @xmath66 ergs/(@xmath67 sr ) released by the central engine , the initial lorenz factor @xmath68 of the blast wave , and the opening half - angle @xmath69 of the collimated outflow .",
    "we take @xmath70 and consider either uncollimated or collimated outflows with @xmath71 .",
    "this opening angle relaxes the energy requirements by a factor of @xmath72 for a one - sided jet .",
    "( two additional complications , not dealt with here , are angular gradients in outflows and lateral spreading of the blast wave . )",
    "the initial blast wave lorentz factor @xmath68 is closely related to the baryon loading of the fireball , because the optically thick fireball expands until most of its initial energy @xmath73 has been transferred to the kinetic energy of the outflowing baryons @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the mass of the baryons . as the blast wave sweeps up and captures material from the surrounding environment , it decelerates and becomes energized by the addition of nonthermal particles with lorentz factors @xmath50 in the comoving blast - wave frame .",
    "the circumburster environment is likely to be highly structured in all cases , but especially if the progenitor of a grb is a massive star located in a star forming region where stellar winds could introduce inhomogeneities . nevertheless , the surrounding density distribution is usually parameterized by the function @xmath76 .",
    "we take @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 as standard values , though @xmath80 would be more appropriate for a wind . in the esm ,",
    "the measured durations of grbs are comparable with the deceleration time scale @xmath81^{1/3}/(c\\gamma_0^{8/3})$ ] .",
    "the microscopic parameters include the fraction @xmath82 of nonthermal swept - up proton kinetic energy transferred to nonthermal electrons , the injection index @xmath83 of the electrons , and the maximum electron energy parameter @xmath51 , given through the kinematic limit @xmath84 .",
    "the comoving magnetic field strength @xmath85 is set by an equipartition argument",
    ". the value of the magnetic equipartition parameter @xmath86 is defined by @xmath87 .",
    "we let @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , and furthermore assume that the microscopic parameters are time - independent .",
    "the low value of @xmath86 is required @xcite to reproduce the generic eq.(1 ) spectrum .",
    "the numerical simulation model @xcite treats synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , synchrotron self - absorption and adiabatic loss processes , and follows blast - wave evolution self - consistently .",
    "the photons are attenuated by @xmath0 absorption , but pair reinjection is not followed .",
    "4 shows temporally evolving spectra for the standard uncollimated parameter set .",
    "the @xmath0 process degrades only @xmath92 0.1 tev photons for the results shown here .",
    "thus the internal attenuation of high - energy gamma rays in the esm is not too severe and the ssc component is bright enough that tev radiation is produced at a comparable @xmath8 level as the synchrotron radiation .",
    "dirty fireballs produce a larger relative @xmath8 flux in the ssc component than in the synchrotron component .",
    "we @xcite propose that the tev radiation detected by milagro from grb 970417a and reported at this meeting @xcite is the ssc emission from a nearby @xmath93 grb .",
    "fits to fig .",
    "2 data @xcite , taking into account batse triggering properties and the strong biases against detecting dirty fireballs with @xmath94 , imply a very large population of undiscovered optical and x - ray transients with well - characterized properties .",
    "the clean fireball population produces sub - second transients peaking at gev - tev energies @xcite that glast , agile , or erenkov detectors could discover .",
    "the distribution of baryon - loading parameters @xmath68 toward clean fireballs falls , however , below a power - law parameterization of the @xmath68 distribution @xcite , indicating that the space density of clean fireballs is less than that for fireballs producing detectable grbs ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "very clean fireballs ( @xmath96 ) could produce tev bursts of radiation .",

    "5 @xcite are multiplied by time to show where most counts will be detected in logarithmic intervals of time .",
    "synchrotron radiation forms the early mev and gev peaks  this is the grb itself .",
    "the ssc component forms the early tev peak .",
    "the later peaks at mev and gev energies are due to the ssc component becoming increasingly dominant in these wavebands as the blast wave decelerates .",
    "the second maximum at gev energies occurs at @xmath98 s , comparable to the duration of the extended emission observed from grb 940217 . because the relative fluxes of prompt and delayed emission are greater at gev energies than at mev energies for these parameters , it is more probable that delayed gev emission rather than mev emission would be detected from a grb , as in fact was observed with egret from grb 940217",
    ". however , the particular calculation shown here corresponds to a uniform surrounding , whereas the behavior of the light curve shown in fig .",
    "3 could be explained with the esm only in terms of a highly structured medium .",
    "we emphasize that the full range of possible behaviors for spectral and temporal evolution , of which fig .",
    "5 represents only one possibility , has hardly been explored .",
    "glast , with its larger effective area and field - of - view , should be able to monitor the evolution of the ssc spectral feature due to blast wave deceleration from many bright grbs .",
    "broadband mev - gev and gev - tev spectral indices due to blast - wave deceleration are plotted in the right panel in fig .",
    "5 for the standard parameter set studied here . during the early phase",
    ", the mev - gev photon spectral index corresponds to a soft cooled synchrotron spectrum , here with a value @xmath99 for the @xmath90 injection electron spectrum , in accord with measurements of @xmath22 mev egret spectra @xcite .",
    "the gev - tev index is much harder because this waveband primarily samples the harder ssc component . after the prompt phase",
    ", the gev - tev index softens to a spectrum that is even softer than the cooled synchrotron spectrum due to effects of @xmath0 attenuation , and the mev - gev index hardens as the ssc radiation sweeps into this waveband .",
    "the mev - gev index approaches the cooled synchrotron limit at later times .",
    "spectral hardening in the mev - gev band in the early afterglow phase due to the deceleration of the blast wave as it interacts with a smooth external medium constitutes generic behavior of the esm which can be tested with glast , and can be confronted by observations of gev and tev detectors of bright grbs with smooth mev light curves that signify a grb source within a uniform surrounding .",
    "the nonthermal energy carried into grb blast waves by hadrons is larger by a factor @xmath100 than the energy carried by leptons , so hadronic effects can hardly be negligible .",
    "the physics of transferring energy from hadrons to leptons is just one of the many open questions in this field .",
    "an important related question is whether grb blast waves accelerate ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "the validity of this idea @xcite was argued by comparing the energy densities of uhecrs with the globally averaged injection of energy by grbs into a volume no greater than , for @xmath101 ev uhecrs , the zatsepin - kuzmin - greisen radius outside which uhecrs are degraded by photomeson production on cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "photomeson neutrino production at @xmath102 ev @xcite , and gev @xmath4-ray production from proton synchrotron radiation @xcite are both potentially observable signatures of uhecr acceleration by grbs .    the uhecrs are claimed to be accelerated either through a first - order shock @xcite or second - order @xcite stochastic fermi process .",
    "the shock fermi mechanism fails for collapsar models of grbs @xcite because only the first shock cycle produces a @xmath103 energy gain .",
    "subsequent cycles give energy increases of only factors - of-2 , because the shock catches up to the particle before it can complete more than a small fraction of its cycle .",
    "the simplest approach is to assume @xcite that no acceleration follows the capture of particles into the blast wave ; of course , no uhecrs are then produced .",
    "such a process could produce a low - level flux of @xmath4 rays at @xmath104 gev and radio / optical synchrotron radiation from the process @xmath105 , e@xmath106 , where the low - energy protons are the thermal baryon - load material .",
    "this approach appears too inefficient , however , to describe flaring events .",
    "magnetic turbulence injected by charged dust during the capture and isotropization process could , though gyroresonant processes , accelerate protons to ultra - high energies @xcite , as could the turbulence generated when the blast wave encounters inhomogeneities in the circumburster medium .",
    "the shock front will likely be rayleigh - taylor unstable , and this will also generate turbulence in the blast wave .",
    "the population of grbs with redshifts now permits a more quantitative estimate of the rate density of grb sources .",
    "stecker @xcite argues that if grbs follow the star - formation rate history of the universe , then a much smaller energy injection rate of uhecrs into the local universe occurs , so that grbs can not be the source of the uhecrs .",
    "this argument does not take into account the predicted but so - far undetected dirty fireball population , which can introduce a 2 - 3 orders - of - magnitude increase in the source density of grbs @xcite and therefore uhecrs .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that if energy is transferred very inefficiently from hadrons to electrons , then the total hadron energy in grbs is @xmath100 greater than implied by the gamma - ray measurements .",
    "hence @xmath107 ergs sr@xmath6 .",
    "we resist this proposal because it multiplies difficulties in understanding the energetics of grb sources .",
    "slow decay of gev - tev radiation from proton synchrotron radiation provides evidence in favor of hadrons in grbs .",
    "protons are much less radiative than leptons unless they are far more energetic ; thus hadrons are more likely to be weakly cooled .",
    "when protons are injected with number index @xmath108 , the uncooled gev proton synchrotron flux decays in the adiabatic regime with temporal index @xmath109 ( flux @xmath110 ) . in comparison",
    ", the optical and x - ray synchrotron radiation decays as @xmath111 for strongly cooling electrons that are likewise injected with @xmath112 .",
    "the temporal decay from slowly cooling hadrons is thus slower than for strongly cooling leptons .",
    "consequently gev proton synchrotron radiation should decay more slowly than lepton synchrotron and ssc radiations . before more concrete conclusions can be drawn , however ,",
    "further studies are needed to distinguish between the behavior of the hadronic and ssc emissions , and to treat diffusive acceleration , cascade processes and uhecr escape from the grb blast wave .",
    "gamma - ray transparency arguments push one irresistibly toward a relativistic blast - wave model of grbs .",
    "the standard fireball / blast wave model implies strong gev / tev radiation from the ssc process @xcite . using parameters optimized to fit prompt",
    "hard x - ray and soft @xmath4-ray emission from grbs , our calculations show nearly coincident mev / tev light curves and extended gev light curves due to the dominance of the ssc component at gev energies in the early afterglow phase . in the framework of the esm , gev and tev observations",
    "chart the evolution of the ssc component and hence the evolution and changes of the blast wave .",
    "calculations of the mev , gev and tev light curves were made for a standard parameter set , showing that the gev band displays a soft - to - hard - to - soft evolution as the ssc component sweeps through this waveband .",
    "this spectral prediction applies to blast waves which decelerate in a uniform medium as evidenced by smooth grb light curves ; circumburster medium structure introduces many possible variations to the light curves and spectral behaviors not yet explored ( compare figure 3 ) .",
    "the possible existence of a class of very clean fireballs that produce @xmath113 ms flashes of gev and tev radiation is a straightforward prediction of the blast wave model .",
    "the related prediction of a large class of dirty fireballs finds good company with the hypothesis that grb blast waves accelerate energetic hadrons , because the dirty fireballs provide a much more numerous source population with which to provide the energy of the uhecrs observed locally .",
    "hadronic acceleration might reveal itself through the slow decay of gev - tev proton synchrotron radiation , but better studies are needed for quantitative predictions .",

    "<S> gamma - ray burst ( grb ) engines are probed most intimately during the prompt gamma - ray luminous phase when the expanding blast wave is closest to the explosion center . using grbs 990123 and 940217 as guides , we briefly review observations of high - energy emission from grbs and summarize some problems in grb physics . @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> transparency arguments imply relativistic beaming . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters that go into the external shock model are stated , and we show numerical simulation results of gamma - ray light curves from relativistic blast waves with different amounts of baryon loading . a distinct component due to the synchrotron self - compton process produces significant emission at gev and tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for spectral and temporal evolution at these energies are presented for a blast wave expanding into uniform surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> observations of the slow decay of gev - tev radiation provide evidence for ultra - high energy cosmic ray acceleration in grbs . </S>"
