    "we study the gravitational and electromagnetic radiation of energy , momentum and angular momentum of superconducting closed cosmic strings with chiral current .",
    "cosmic strings are linear topological defects , that may have been created during phase transitions in the early universe ( see e.  g. reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "oscillating ordinary cosmic strings ( without current ) radiate only gravitational waves .",
    "the corresponding energy radiation was studied in @xcite . besides energy , gravitational waves from strings",
    "take also momentum @xcite and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it was found that the rates ( averaged per oscillation period ) of energy @xmath0 , momentum @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath2 losses can be expressed in the following form : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are numerical coefficients , depending on the particular string configuration , @xmath9 is length of the string , @xmath10 is string mass per unit length and used units @xmath11 .",
    "witten @xcite showed that in some field theory models the cosmic strings can carry superconducting current which is coupled to some gauge field . in the case of electromagnetic gauge field",
    "the superconducting cosmic string loops would radiate not only gravitational waves , but also electromagnetic ones .",
    "equations of motion of superconducting cosmic strings can be solved analytically @xcite if ( i ) the influence of gauge field on the string motion is negligible and ( ii ) the current on the string @xmath12 is chiral , i.  e. @xmath13 .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiated by the single cusp on chiral cosmic string was studied by blanco - pillado and olum @xcite in the case of small current .",
    "the opposite case for current which is close to maximum value was considered in @xcite .",
    "if the string carries the current , then the coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 which determine the gravitational radiation depend on the current along the string .",
    "corresponding expressions for electromagnetic radiation have the similar form : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where numerical coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 also depend on the current on the string .",
    "in this paper we present the results for gravitational and electromagnetic radiation of energy , momentum and angular momentum from chiral cosmic string loops for any value of superconducting current . due to the periodic motion of the cosmic string loops",
    "the rates of radiation losses can be expand in series @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are correspondingly the energy , momentum and angular momentum rates in the @xmath29-th radiation mode . usually the total rates per unit time ( averaged over the period ) are calculated by summing of losses in different modes . in practical numerical calculations",
    "the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are determined with the accuracy up to the @xmath29 of a few hundred .",
    "such calculations may be not correct because of the slow convergence of the corresponding sums over @xmath29 as was pointed out by allen et al .",
    "see however @xcite where for some special cases of ordinary string loops the summation over @xmath29 was done and analytic expressions for the total energy and momentum rates into gravitational waves were obtained .",
    "we perform in the following the summation over radiation modes analytically and derive the formulas for energy , momentum and angular momentum rates into the both the gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from chiral string loops of general configuration .",
    "the corresponding radiation rates into the unit solid angle are reduced to the four - dimensional integrals which in general case can be calculated only numerically . for chiral piece - wise linear loops these formulas lead to analytic expressions for the energy , momentum and angular momentum radiation into the unit solid angle .",
    "we considered three examples of chiral string loops and calculated the total radiated energy , moment and angular moment per unit time in dependence of current on the string .",
    "the first and the second examples are piece - wise linear loops ( or `` kinky '' loops ) , and the third example is a hybrid of piece - wise loop and smooth loop ( namely , the @xmath30-loop is smooth and @xmath31-loop is piece - wise loop ) .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to present the results for kinkless cosmic loops ( i.  e. for smooth @xmath30 and @xmath31-loops ) , because it would take an enormous amount of computer time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:11 ]",
    "we review some general properties of chiral cosmic strings . in section  [ sec : gr ] we derive new expressions for gravitational radiation rates of energy , momentum and angular momentum by chiral loops of general configuration into the unit solid angle .",
    "these expressions are reduced to the four - dimensional integrals where the summation over all radiation modes were performed analytically . in section  [ sec : el ]",
    "we derive the similar formulas for electromagnetic radiation rates . in section  [ sec : ex ] we present numerical calculations of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation rates for some illustrative examples of chiral loops and study the properties of chiral strings radiation in dependence of current . in conclusion section  [ sec : co ]",
    "we describe the obtained results and discuss some qualitative features of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from chiral loops .",

    "the decreasing of radiated energy with mode number @xmath29 is more pronounced for larger current , as it should be physically , because the maximal speed of the string is decreasing with the increasing of the current . in the case of electromagnetic radiation",
    "besides the overall decreasing of energy with the mode number one can see in fig .",
    "[ enem2 - 2 ] also the weak oscillations of energy rate .",

    "for @xmath229 the results are presented in the table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".the radiation rates from hybrid kinky loop [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     durrer in @xcite found that the radiated angular momentum for some particular class of ordinary cosmic string loops @xmath230 is antiparallel to the stationary angular momentum @xmath231 of the loop .",
    "it means that angular momentum of the loops always decreases with time due to gravitational radiation .",
    "our results for angular momentum radiation into electromagnetic and gravitational waves for string loops with chiral current agree in general with the results of durrer .",
    "the chiral loops considered in this paper also lose angular momentum with time .",
    "but unlike the examples considered by durrer we found that for some configurations of chiral loops @xmath232 and @xmath233 are not exactly antiparallel to total angular momentum of the loop @xmath234 , but deviate on some small angle . in the table  [ table2 ] the values @xmath235 and @xmath236 ,",

    "we found the general formulas for gravitational and electromagnetic energy , momentum and angular momentum radiation rates into the unit solid angle from chiral cosmic string loops .",
    "the main new result of the paper is the presentation of the radiation rates from oscillating string loops in the integral form . in the corresponding integrals",
    "the summations of infinite mode series have been performed analytically .",
    "the derived expressions for @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 contain four - dimensional integrals , which depend on the particular loop configuration .",
    "the derived integral presentation is especially convenient for numerical calculations in comparison with a weakly convergent summation over modes . to find the total rates of radiated energy , momentum and angular momentum one should integrate the obtained expressions over unit sphere .",
    "the final expressions for gravitational and electromagnetic radiation can be written in the following form : @xmath243 where numerical coefficients @xmath244 depend on the loop configuration ( and also on the current along the loop ) . applying our formulas to some examples of chiral string loop configurations we calculated numerically coefficients @xmath244 as functions of @xmath205 .    in this paper",
    "the following three family of examples have been considered : ( i ) the piece - wise linear kinky loop with @xmath30 and @xmath31-loop consisting of two straight parts ( 2 - 2 piece - wise loop ) ; ( ii ) the piece - wise linear loop such that @xmath30-loop consists of two segments and @xmath31-loop consists of three segments ( 2 - 3 piece - wise loop ) ; ( iii ) the hybrid loop in which @xmath30-loop is circle and @xmath31-loop consists of two straight parts ( hybrid kinky loop ) . for first and second examples",
    "the four - dimensional integrals in our expressions for radiated energy , momentum and angular momentum become the multiple sums over the kinks .",
    "these sums can be analytically calculated using the symbolic computation on computer ( e.  g. `` mathematica '' packet ) . to obtain the radiation for third example ( hybrid loop ) we calculated two - dimensional integrals ( originated from the smooth @xmath30-loop ) and summed over the kinks of @xmath31-loop .",
    "unfortunately , we could not carry out the calculations for strings with @xmath30 and @xmath31 loops being arbitrary smooth closed curves because the corresponding calculations of four - dimensional integrals take an enormous amount of time .    for considered examples we observe weak oscillations of the electromagnetic radiation as a function of mode number .",
    "these oscillations ( accompanied with a general decreasing of the radiation rate with mode number ) have the different periods depending on the current along the string : the larger current the smaller the period of oscillations .",
    "this effect does not take place for gravitational radiation .",
    "the total gravitational radiation of energy , momentum and angular momentum behave in a similar way .",
    "they increase slowly with @xmath205 , when @xmath205 is small ( and the current is large ) and rapidly increase at large @xmath205 ( or at large current ) . in total",
    "the gravitational radiation rates are increasing monotonous functions of @xmath205 .",
    "for the electromagnetic radiation the situation is different : the losses of energy , momentum and angular momentum into electromagnetic waves for all considered examples have maximum near @xmath206 , i.  e. when the current is rather small . for considered examples",
    "the maximal coefficients in ( [ gamma1 ] ) have the following values : @xmath245    we also have found , that for some non - symmetric examples of chiral loops , the radiated angular momentum @xmath246 into electromagnetic and gravitational waves is not exactly opposite to the angular momentum of the loop @xmath231 , but slightly differ from it ( even when there is no current on the string ) , unlike the other types of loops considered by durrer @xcite ."
