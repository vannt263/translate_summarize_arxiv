    "uks 2323326 ( ugca 438 ) is a faint dwarf irregular galaxy in sculptor discovered by longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) . in the discovery paper ,",
    "longmore et al . estimated the distance to this galaxy from the rough estimate of the magnitude of the brightest stars , to be 1.3 mpc with a large error of @xmath20 % .",
    "since then this galaxy has been often considered to be a member of the local group ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the velocity of uks 2323326 from the center of the local group , 82 km  s@xmath21 ( @xcite ) , suggests that it may not belong to the local group ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "accurate measurement of the distance to this galaxy is needed to resolve this problem .",
    "longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) measured the hi flux of @xmath22 jy km  s@xmath21 at the heliocentric velocity of @xmath23 km  s@xmath21 , and derived , using eye - estimate with the photographic plates , the magnitude of the brightest blue stars in uks 2323326 , @xmath24 mag .",
    "after the discovery paper , however , there has been published no detailed photometric study for this galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present a study of stellar populations of uks 2323326 based on deep @xmath0 ccd photometry , and show that this galaxy is outside the local group and is a member of the sculptor group .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction , and section 3 investigates the morphological structure of uks 2323326 .",
    "section 4 presents the color - magnitude diagrams of uks 2323326 , section 5 estimates the distance to uks 2323326 .",
    "section 6 presents the surface photometry of uks 2323326 and section 7 discusses the group membership , the stellar populations , and the brightest stars of uks 2323326 .",
    "finally , summary and conclusion are given in section 8 .",
    "@xmath0 ccd images of uks 2323326 were obtained on the photometric night of 1994 october 7 ( ut ) using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope at mauna kea .",
    "table 1 lists the journal of the observations of uks 2323326 .",
    "a grey scale map of the @xmath25-band ccd image of uks 2323326 is displayed in fig .",
    "the size of the field of view is @xmath26 and the ( @xmath27 binned ) pixel scale of the ccd is 0.44 arcsec pixel@xmath21 .    for the analysis of the data we have divided the field covered by our ccd images into three regions as shown in fig .",
    "1 : the c - region which covers the central region ( @xmath28 ) of uks 2323326 , the i - region which covers the outer region ( @xmath29 ) of the galaxy , and the f - region which represents a control field with the same area of the c - region plus i - region .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the stars in the ccd images were derived using dophot ( @xcite ) .",
    "these magnitudes were transformed onto the standard system using the standard stars observed during two nights including the same night ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transformation equations we derived from the photometry of the standard stars are : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where upper cases and lower cases represent , respectively , the standard system and instrumental system .",
    "@xmath34 represents the air mass .",
    "the rms scatter of the solutions are 0.01  0.02 mag .",
    "the total number of stars which were measured at @xmath25 and at least one other color in the ccd image is @xmath352,000 .",
    "table 2 lists @xmath0 photometry of the measured bright stars with @xmath36 mag in the field of uks 2323326 .",
    "the coordinates x and y in table 2 are given in units of pixel ( = 0.44 arcsec ) , and increase to the east and to the south , respectively .",
    "unfortunately there is a very bright star @xmath37 south - east of the center of uks 2323326 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . it is about 14 mag foreground star ( @xcite ) and is saturated in all our ccd images .",
    "fig.1 shows that there are several tens of bright stars concentrated in the central region of uks 2323326 .",
    "these stars are considered mostly to be the members of uks 2323326 and are young massive stars as shown later .",
    "the main body of the galaxy is mostly seen inside the c - region , and is slightly elongated along the south - east direction .",
    "however , the outer part of the galaxy seen at the faint level extends out to the boundary of the i - region ( @xmath38 ) , and is impressively almost circular .",
    "there are few bright stars in the i - region .",
    "instead there are many faint stars seen better in @xmath39 and @xmath40 images of the i - region , which are probably old red giant stars as seen later .",
    "therefore uks 2323326 is a circular galaxy , in the central region of which there are irregularly distributed some bright stars .",
    "this kind of structure that some young stars are irregularly distributed against the smooth background of old stellar populations is common among irregular galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "uks 2323326 is located 71 deg below the galactic plane in the sky so that the foreground reddening for uks 2323326 is expected to be very low .",
    "we adopt in this study the foreground reddening value of @xmath41 mag for uks 2323326 given by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we display @xmath25@xmath42 and @xmath40@xmath43 diagrams of 520 measured stars in the c - region , 280 measured stars in the i - region , and 89 measured stars in the f - region in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "note that the area of the ( c+i)-region in the field is the same as that of the f - region so that we can estimate the contamination due to foreground stars by comparing directly the diagrams of each region .",
    "several distinguishable features of the stars in uks 2323326 are seen in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "first , there is a blue plume of bright stars with @xmath44 in the c - region ( filled circles ) .",
    "comparison of the c - region and the f - region in fig .",
    "2 shows that these bright blue stars are mostly members of uks 2323326 .",
    "the brightest end of the blue plume extends up to @xmath45 mag and @xmath46 .",
    "these stars are mostly massive stars which were formed recently .",
    "stars in the i - region are all fainter than @xmath47 mag ( open circles ) , much fainter than those bright stars in the c - region .",
    "this shows that there was little star formation in the outer part of uks 2323326 recently .",
    "secondly , there are five red bright stars with @xmath48 mag and @xmath49 in the c - region in fig .",
    "this area of the f - region color - magnitude diagram is devoid of stars",
    ". therefore these stars are probably the members of uks 2323326 .",
    "these stars are considered to be red supergiant stars which were formed recently .",
    "thirdly , fig .",
    "3 shows that there is a strong concentration of red stars fainter than @xmath50 mag in the ( c+i)-region . most of these stars are probably old red giant branch ( rgb ) stars of uks 2323326 .",
    "we estimate the distance to uks 2323326 using the @xmath40 magnitude of the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) , as described in da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) and lee , freedman , & madore ( 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath40 magnitude of the trgb is estimated using the @xmath51 diagram in fig . 3 and the luminosity function of red giant stars .",
    "4 shows the @xmath40-band luminosity function of the measured red stars in the i - region ( solid line ) and the c - region ( dotted line ) , from which the contribution due to field stars was subtracted .",
    "we also plot the luminosity functions of the similar stars in the field with the same area as the ( c+i ) region in fig .",
    "4 , which shows that the contribution due to field stars is very small .",
    "the i - region is more appropriate for measuring the magnitude of the trgb than the c - region , because there are several young bright stars in the c - region and because the crowding is more severe in the c - region than in the i - region . in fig .",
    "4 , as the magnitude increases , there is a sudden increase at @xmath52 mag in the luminosity function of the i - region , which corresponds to the trgb seen in the color - magnitude diagram in fig . 3 .",
    "several stars brighter than the trgb are mostly asymptotic giant stars of intermediate age , also seen in other dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "a dip seen at the magnitude of the trgb in the luminosity function of the c - region is a statistical fluke .",
    "the mean color of the trgb is estimated to be @xmath53 .",
    "the bolometric magnitude of the trgb is then calculated from @xmath54 } - 3.81 $ ] .",
    "adopting a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath55 dex as estimated below , we obtain a value for the bolometric magnitude of @xmath56 mag . the bolometric correction at @xmath40 for the trgb is estimated to be bc@xmath57 mag , adopting a formula for the bolometric correction bc@xmath58 = 0.881  0.243@xmath59 . the intrinsic @xmath40 magnitude of the trgb is then given by @xmath60 mag .",
    "finally the distance modulus of uks 2323326 is obtained : @xmath61 mag ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath62 mpc ) for an adopted extinction of @xmath63 mag .",
    "we have estimated the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in uks 2323326 using the @xmath43 color of the stars 0.5 mag fainter than the trgb , @xmath64 .",
    "this color is measured from the median value of the colors of 17 red giant branch stars with @xmath65 mag , to be @xmath66 . from this value",
    "we estimate the mean metallicity to be [ fe / h ] @xmath67 dex . in fig .",
    "5 we overlayed the loci of the red giant branches of galactic globular clusters , of m15 , m2 , and ngc 1851 , shifted according to the distance and reddening of uks 2323326 .",
    "the metallicities of m15 , m2 and ngc 1851 are [ fe / h ] = 2.17 , 1.58 and 1.29 dex , respectively .",
    "5 shows that the bright part of the rgb of uks 2323326 is located well between those of m15 and m2 .",
    "the broadening of the faint part of the rgb is mostly due to the photometric errors , as shown by the error bars in fig .",
    "5 . thus the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in uks 2323326 is very low , and is close to the lowest end in the metallicity of dwarf irregular galaxies ( @xcite ; lee 1995a , b;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "it is very difficult to derive reliably the surface photometry of uks 2323326 , because of the presence of very bright foreground star close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "we have obtained the surface photometry of uks 2323326 as follows .",
    "first , we removed in the original ccd images the images of very bright foreground star and several other bright stars which were obviously considered to be foreground stars in the area of uks 2323326 , using imedit in iraf .",
    "then we performed aperture photometry of uks 2323326 using the circular annular aperture .",
    "the value of the sky background was estimated from the mean intensity of the f - region .",
    "subtraction of the very bright 14 mag star from the image of the galaxy is very difficult .",
    "the error due to this problem is not easy to quantify , but may be significant in the photometry of the galaxy .",
    "therefore the surface photometry of the galaxy derived in this study is only approximate .",
    "the results of surface photometry of uks 2323326 are listed in table 3 and are displayed in fig .",
    "6 . in table",
    "3 @xmath68 presents the mean major radius of an annular aperture , and @xmath69 represents the outer radius of an annular aperture .",
    "6(a ) shows that the surface brightness profiles are almost flat in the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath70 arcsec ) , and follow approximately the exponential law in the outer part ( @xmath71 arcsec ) .",
    "we fit the @xmath25 surface brightness profile of the inner region of uks 2323326 with the single - mass isotropic king models ( @xcite ) and that of the outer region with the exponential law in fig .",
    "7 shows that the surface brightness profile of the inner region is roughly fit by a king model with a core concentration parameter @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 represent the core radius and tidal radius , respectively .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the outer region are fit roughly by an exponential law with a scale length of @xmath75 arcsec = 210 pc .",
    "6(b ) illustrates the surface color profiles for the region at @xmath76 arcsec .",
    "the colors files are plotted only for the region at @xmath76 arcsec , beyond which the errors of the colors are too large .",
    "the color profiles are almost constant and become slowly redder outward from the center to @xmath77 arcsec .",
    "the rapid change of the color profiles right close to the center is due to a bright star in the central region .",
    "the properties of the surface brightness and color profiles of uks2323326 are similar to those of other dwarf galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    from the data of the surface photometry we have derived several basic parameters of uks 2323326 as follows .",
    "the standard radius and holmberg radius of uks 2323326 are measured to be @xmath78 = 46 arcsec = 460 pc and @xmath79 = 70 arcsec = 700 pc , respectively .",
    "these radii are similar , respectively , to the radii of the c - region and i - region shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that our value for the holmberg radius is much larger than the value longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) derived roughly from their photographic plate , @xmath79 = 45 arcsec .",
    "the central surface brightness of uks 2323326 is measured to be @xmath80 mag arcsec@xmath81 , @xmath82 mag arcsec@xmath81 , @xmath83 mag arcsec@xmath81 , and @xmath84 mag arcsec@xmath81 .",
    "the total magnitudes of uks 2323326 within @xmath79 are derived to be @xmath5 mag , @xmath6 mag , @xmath7 mag , and @xmath8 mag , and the corresponding absolute magnitudes are @xmath9 mag , @xmath10 mag , @xmath11 mag , and @xmath12 mag .",
    "@xmath85 total magnitude of uks 2323326 derived in this study , @xmath5 mag , is about 1 mag brighter than that given by longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , @xmath86 mag .",
    "we have measured the distance to uks 2323326 to be @xmath87 mpc from the @xmath40-band magnitude of the trgb , which is an accurate distance indicator for resolved galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our value is 1.6 times larger and much more accurate than the value longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) suggested , from the eye - estimate of the magnitude of the blue brightest stars , @xmath88 mpc with an error of @xmath89 % .",
    "our result shows that uks 2323326 is obviously outside the local group .",
    "the mean distance of the sculptor group is 2.5 mpc and the radius of the sculptor group is @xmath351.1 mpc ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "uks2323326 is located in the western boundary of the sculptor group in the sky ( see the map of the sculptor group members given in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore uks 2323326 is definitely considered to be a member of the sculptor group .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the measured velocity of uks 2323326 . from the measured heliocentric velocity of this galaxy , @xmath90 km  s@xmath21 ,",
    "the velocity of uks 2323326 from the center of the local group is calculated to be @xmath91 km  s@xmath21  ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this value is 24 km  s@xmath21   larger than the maximum value of 60 km  s@xmath21 typically used as the boundary of the local group , showing that this galaxy is probably outside the boundary of the local group .",
    "cte et al .",
    "( 1997 ) excluded uks 2323 - 326 in the list of dwarf candidates for the sculptor group , based on the results given by longmore et al .",
    "however , our results show that this galaxy should be included as a member of the sculptor group .      in the discovery paper longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) detected no hii region in uks 2323 - 326 ( which was confirmed later by miller 1996 ) and pointed out that the low optical surface brightness and blue color of this galaxy is difficult to reconcile using current evolutionary models of late - type galaxies .",
    "however , it is shown here that the blue color of this galaxy is due to a presence of young stellar populations .",
    "we have investigated roughly the properties of young stellar populations seen in fig .",
    "2 using the theoretical isochrones . in fig . 8 , we overlay , in the @xmath92 diagram of uks 2323326 , three isochrones for the metallicity of @xmath93 ( [ fe / h ] =  1.2 dex ) and ages of 10 , 30 , and 100 myrs given by the padova group ( @xcite ) .",
    "fig . 8 shows ( 1 ) that the brightest blue and red stars in uks 2323326 match roughly the blue and red loops of the isochrone with an age of 30 myrs , and ( 2 ) that the brightest main - sequence at @xmath94 ( about 1 mag below the brightest blue supergiants ) indicates an age of 10 myrs .",
    "these results show that stars were formed as recently as 10 myrs ago in uks 2323326 . on the other hand , a well - developed rgb shown in the @xmath51 diagram of fig .",
    "3 shows that the bulk of the stars in uks 2323326 were formed before a few gyrs ago , and a small number of agb stars above the trgb were probably formed a few gyrs ago .",
    "9 displays the @xmath25 luminosity function of the main - sequence stars with @xmath44 in uks 2323326 .",
    "the luminosity function we derived is incomplete for the faint end , but is reasonably complete for @xmath95 mag .",
    "the bright part of the luminosity function ( @xmath96 mag , @xmath97 mag ) is approximately fit by a line with a logarithmic slope of @xmath98 , which is similar to those of other irregular and spiral galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated hi flux of this galaxy was measured to be @xmath22 jy km  s@xmath21 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) pointed out that the ratio of the hi mass to @xmath85 luminosity of this galaxy they derived , @xmath99 , is rather large for normal irregular galaxies . with better data for the distance and luminosity obtained in this study ,",
    "we derive an hi mass , @xmath100 @xmath101 , a @xmath85 luminosity , @xmath102 @xmath103 , and a ratio of @xmath104 which is much lower than the value given by longmore et al .",
    "our value for the ratio of the hi mass to @xmath85 luminosity is typical for dwarf irregular galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) estimated roughly from the survey plate the magnitude of the brightest blue stars in uks 2323326 to be @xmath105 mag , and used this result to derive the distance to this galaxy , obtaining a value of 1.3 mpc .",
    "with our photometry we can investigate in detail the properties of the brightest stars in this galaxy .    in the @xmath92 diagram of the c - region of uks 2323326 ( filled circles ) shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is obvious which stars are the three brightest blue and red stars in uks 2323326 .",
    "three brightest blue stars ( called bsg ) are ids 1055 , 1002 , and 1116 , and three brightest red stars ( called rsg ) are ids 956 , 1058 , and 821 , as listed in table 2 .",
    "there is one very blue star ( i d 1140 ) as bright as i d 1116 , but the color is too blue , @xmath106 to be a normal star .",
    "inspection of the image of this object shows that the image is slightly asymmetric so that the point - spread function fitting photometry of this object may not be as good as that of other normal stars .",
    "so we did not include it in the sample of the three brightest blue stars .",
    "the mean magnitudes and colors of these three brightest blue and red stars in uks 2323326 are derived to be , respectively , @xmath107 mag and @xmath108 , and @xmath109 mag and @xmath110 .",
    "( if i d 1116 is replaced by i d 1140 , the mean values will be slightly changed : @xmath111 mag and @xmath112 . )",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colors are @xmath113 mag , @xmath114 , @xmath115 mag , and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the luminosity of the brightest stars in galaxies is known to be correlated with the luminosity of the parent galaxies .",
    "recently lyo & lee ( 1997 ) presented , from the analysis of 17 galaxies ( with @xmath117 mag ) to which cepheid distances are available , calibrations for the relation between the magnitudes of the brightest stars and the magnitudes of the parent galaxies : @xmath118 with @xmath119 mag , and @xmath120 with @xmath121 mag . using these relations",
    ", we derive @xmath122 mag and @xmath123 mag for the absolute magnitude of uks 2323326 as derived in the previous section .",
    "thus the magnitudes of the brightest stars in uks 2323326 are 0.50.6 mag fainter than those expected from the relation for the bright galaxies .",
    "we have presented a study of the stellar populations in the dwarf irregular galaxy uks 2323326 based on deep @xmath0 ccd photometry .",

    "these color - magnitude diagrams exhibit a blue plume , a well - defined rgb , and a small number of agb stars with intermediate age .",
    "\\(2 ) the tip of the rgb is found to be at @xmath125 mag and @xmath53 mag . from this value",
