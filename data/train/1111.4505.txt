    "the lat first - year catalog ( 1fgl ; abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) has 1451 sources .",
    "the majority of these @xmath0-ray bright sources that have been identified with radio sources are associated with blazars ( 685 of 1451 ) .",
    "these blazars typically are strong , compact radio sources which exhibit flat radio spectra , rapid variability , compact cores with one - sided parsec - scale jets , and superluminal motion in the jets ( marscher 2006 ) .",
    "several very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) programs , such as the monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments ( mojave ; lister et al .  2009a ; homan et al .  2009 ; lister et al .",

    "2011 ) are in place to monitor the radio jets from the brightest blazars such as 3c273 , bl lac , etc .",
    "our sample has a flux limit roughly an order of magnitude below the mojave survey and so allows us to probe the extensions of the radio core/@xmath0-ray properties down to a fainter population .",
    "many different radio-@xmath0-ray correlations have been suggested ( taylor et al .",

    "by examining a larger sample ( 1248 objects ) we attempt to obtain more definitive insight into several other properties of @xmath0-ray bright blazars .",
    "in section 2 we define our sample . in section 3",
    "we briefly describe the data reduction process for our vlba observations . in section 4",
    "we present data on the @xmath0-ray flux and radio flux densities of the lat sources . in section 5",

    "we compare several parameters of the lat and non - lat sources .",
    "notes on some individual objects of interest are presented in section 7 and in section 8 we discuss our results . throughout this paper",

    "we obtained time on the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to observe lat - detected sources from november of 2009 to july of 2010 .",
    "we had a total of 7 observing runs and collected 5 ghz data on 232 sources .",
    "the first 3 observing runs were follow - up observations on 90 sources in the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips ; helmboldt et al .  2007 ) and new 5 ghz observations of 7 sources in the mojave sample .",
    "the remaining 135 sources were selected from the fermi 1fgl as sources which were associated with a source in the combined radio all - sky targeted eight ghz survey ( crates ; healey et al .",
    "2007 ) with high ( @xmath480% ) probability , had a flux density of at least 30 mjy in crates , and were not in vips or mojave .",
    "of the 232 sources , 95 are bl lac objects , 107 are fsrqs , and 30 are other types of agn ( radio galaxies , agn of unknown type , and 1 starburst galaxy ) .",
    "any object that is not a bl lac object or fsrq we classify as ` agn / other ' .",
    "the optical classifications are taken from the lat lat first catalog of agn ( 1lac ; abdo et al .",
    "see table  [ datatable ] for a summary of our data .",
    "we should note that several of the 1fgl sources are associated with multiple agn in the 1lac .",
    "not all of the associated sources are in crates , and not all of them are brighter than 30 mjy at 8 ghz .",
    "we make a note of those objects with multiple associations in table  [ datatable ] .",
    "we observed 2 radio sources for 3 of the lat sources in our sample .",
    "the lat source 1fgl j1225.8 + 4336 is associated with the bl lac object vips j12248 + 4335 ( probability 94% ) and the fsrq vips j12269 + 4340 ( probability 87% ) .",
    "the lat source 1fgl j0448.6 + 1118 is associated with the fsrq crates j0448 + 1127 ( f04486 + 112a in our sample ; probability 99% ) and the bl lac object pks",

    "it is possible that all of these sources are emitting @xmath0-rays , so we included all of them in our calculations .",
    "where possible , we use the 1lac redshifts .",
    "if the source did not have a redshift listed in 1lac , we searched the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .    to build a non - lat detected sample for comparison , we excluded all lat sources from vips , leaving 1018 objects in our non - lat sample . of these 1018 objects , 24 are bl lacs , 479 are fsrqs , and 515 are agn / other types ( radio galaxies or agn of uncertain type ) .",
    "the optical types for vips sources were adopted from the candidate gamma - ray blazar survey ( cgrabs ; healey et al .",
    "all vlba data were correlated using the new difx software correlator ( e.g. , deller et al .",
    "the correlated data was processed via the vips data reduction pipeline using automated scripts .",
    "see taylor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and helmboldt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for a more thorough description of the vips pipeline .",
    "initial calibration ( fringe - fitting , flux and phase calibration , polarization calibration ) was done using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; greisen 2003 ) .",
    "imaging and visibility model - fitting were done using difmap ( shepherd 1997 ) .",
    "throughout the rest of this paper , we will use the nonparametric spearman test ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "1986 ) to look for correlations between the lat - detected and non - lat - detected objects .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficient ( @xmath5 ) has a range of @xmath6 .",
    "a high value of @xmath5 indicates a significant correlation . this is a powerful test for statistical correlation , but it does not test an actual physical correlation . in order to be certain",
    "our correlations are physically significant , we ensure that a redshift selection effect is not adding a bias to our data .    the lat measures @xmath0-ray flux in several bands . to create total @xmath0-ray fluxes , we combined the fluxes from 3 bands : 100 - 300 mev , 300 mev - 1 gev , and 1 - 100 gev .",
    "the fluxes were added and uncertainties were added in quadrature . however , some sources had only upper limits to their fluxes in certain bands .",
    "if a source s reported fluxes in one or two bands were upper limits , we use 1/2 the reported flux as the uncertainty in that band as the upper limits are given as 2-sigma results ( abdo et al .",
    "if a source had upper limits on its flux in all three bands , we adopt the convention of listing its error as 0.00 .",
    "imagine a population of sources covering a wide range of redshifts in which the radio and @xmath0-ray emission is not physically correlated , but in which radio flux and @xmath0-ray flux are correlated with redshift .",
    "this is actually what one would naively expect because the more distant objects will be fainter .",
    "such a population will show a strong correlation of radio flux with gamma ray flux via the spearman test , but this does not indicate a significant physical correlation between these two observables .    however , by investigating the relationship between radio flux density at 5 ghz ( @xmath7 ) and redshift for the lat - detected sources we can rule out a correlation between the two .",
    "we calculated the spearman @xmath5 values for the @xmath7-z relationship for the bl lac objects and fsrqs separately . for the bl lacs ,",
    "the @xmath5 value was 0.308 , with a 2.1% probability that random sampling would produce this same @xmath5 value .",
    "for the fsrqs , the @xmath5 value was 0.109 , with a 26.2% probability of getting the same value by random sampling .",
    "therefore , there is a very marginal correlation between the radio flux density and redshift for our bl lac objects , and no correlation for our fsrqs .",
    "we also tested the correlation between @xmath0-ray flux and redshift .",
    "the @xmath5 values were 0.084 for bl lacs and 0.016 for fsrqs , with the probability of getting the same values from random sampling of 54.0% and 86.8% , respectively .",
    "so , there is no significant correlation between @xmath0-ray flux and redshift for either bl lac objects or fsrqs .",
    "we also visually inspected plots of both lat flux and total vlba radio flux density versus redshift and saw no obvious trends , confirming the correlation coefficient results .      in fig .",
    "[ combfluxflux ] we plot the lat flux versus the total vlba flux density at 5 ghz .",
    "again , the lat fluxes are broadband fluxes from 100 mev to 100 gev .",
    "the spearman @xmath5 values we found were 0.467 for the bl lacs and 0.510 for the fsrqs .",
    "the probabilities for getting the same @xmath5 values from random sampling were 2@xmath810@xmath9 for the bl lac objects and",
    "2@xmath810@xmath10 for the fsrqs .",
    "therefore , the lat flux correlates very strongly with the total vlba flux density .",
    "the bl lac objects do not correlate quite as strongly , especially considering that we found a marginal correlation between total vlba flux density and redshift for these objects in the previous section .",
    "still , this provides solid evidence that objects with higher radio flux density also produce more @xmath0-ray flux .    in our previous paper ( linford et al .",
    "2011 ) , we found that there was no strong correlation between radio flux density and @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "however , our flux densities for those observations were prior to the launch of _",
    "fermi_. furthermore , it is likely that the radio flux density increases during episodes of @xmath0-ray flaring ( e.g. , kovalev et al . 2009 ) .",
    "our newer , larger , and more contemporaneous set of observations are more appropriate for making these comparisons .",
    "the median total vlba flux density at 5 ghz was 177 mjy for the lat bl lacs and 221 mjy for the non - lat bl lacs .",
    "the lat fsrq appeared to have significantly higher flux densities than the non - lat fsrq , with a median of 467 mjy for lat fsrqs compared to a median of only 191 mjy for non - lat fsrqs .",
    "the lat agn / other objects also had higher 5 ghz flux densities than their non - lat sources counterparts .",
    "the kolmogorov- smirnov ( k - s ) test probability that the lat and non - lat bl lac objects belong to the same parent population is about 38% .",
    "the k - s test probability that the lat and non - lat fsrqs are related is only 3@xmath810@xmath11 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fsrq_s5 ] for a plot of the fsrq total vlba 5 ghz flux density distributions .",
    "in this section we investigate the changes in the 90 sources that were part of vips ( i.e. , observed in 2006 or earlier ) and our new sample ( observed in 2009 - 2010 ) . of these 90 sources , 35",
    "are bl lac objects , 44 are fsrqs , and 11 are agn / other objects .",
    "it is important to note that we do not know whether most of our sources were emitting @xmath0-rays in the archival data .",
    "it is possible that many of them would have been detected by _",
    "fermi _ had it been in operation at the time .",
    "only 6 of these sources were detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ satellite . as an estimate of the uncertainty of the median values",
    "we will use the median absolute deviation ( mad ) given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a value in the array @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , it is the median of the positive difference between each entry in x and the overall median of x. see huber & ronchetti ( 2009 ) for more information on the mad .",
    "it is well known that blazars are highly variable sources in the radio and @xmath0-ray regimes .",
    "several studies have also indicated that the radio and @xmath0-ray variability are correlated ( e.g. , kovalev et al . 2009 and schinzel et al .",
    "looking at the differences in total vlba radio flux densities ( see fig .",
    "[ ts5diff ] ) for 90 of our sources that were observed both in 2006 ( or earlier ) and in 2009 , we saw that while there is variability the magnitude of the variability does not appear to correlate with the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "the median total flux densities showed little significant change between the two epochs .",
    "the bl lac objects had a median flux density of 149.2 mjy in the archival data and 133.2 mjy in the new data .",
    "the difference between the medians for the two epochs falls well within the median absolute deviations of 74 mjy for archival data and 72 mjy for the current data .",
    "the fsrqs appeared to become somewhat brighter in the new data , with a median flux density of 256.2 mjy in the archival data and 316.0 mjy in the new data .",
    "again , the difference between the two epochs is not significant when compared to the median absolute deviations of 122 mjy for the archival data and 176 mjy for the current data .",
    "we also looked at the radio emission from the core ( the bright compact component at the base of the jet ) .",
    "the core flux density was found using automatic visibility fitting ( see taylor et al .",
    "2007 for a more detailed discussion of this process ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ cs5diff ] for a plot of the difference in core flux density ( current minus archival ) versus the total lat flux .",
    "again , we found that there is no apparent correlation between core flux density variability with lat flux . the median core flux for the fsrqs is higher during @xmath0-ray detection , going from 225.1 mjy in the archival data to 293.6 mjy in the new data , but this is again within the median absolute deviations of 107 mjy for the archival data and 156 mjy for the new data . also , from fig .",
    "[ cs5diff ] we can see that most of the fsrqs are actually slightly dimmer , with 25 of the 44 fsrqs showing a reduction in in core flux density .",
    "we obtained the brightness temperatures from automatic model - fitting procedure by fitting to the visibility data directly ( taylor et al .",
    "the minimum observable size for each source was calculated using equation ( 2 ) from kovalev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where we computed the snr of each core using the core flux density , the rms measured from the 5 ghz image , and a beam fwhm of 3 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , the largest dimension of our restoring beam . for those sources where the estimated core size was less than this minimum size , we used the minimum size to compute the brightness temperature .    the core brightness temperatures are split almost evenly between those that are lower than they were prior to lat detection and those that are higher .",
    "nearly all had core brightness temperatures in 2009 that were either within 5% of the archival value or higher than the archival value .",
    "the median core brightness temperature for the bl lacs was 2.3@xmath810@xmath15 k for the archival data and 2.9@xmath810@xmath15 k for the new data .",
    "the median core brightness temperature for the fsrqs in the archival data was 8.2@xmath810@xmath15 k for and 6.4@xmath810@xmath15 k for the new data .",
    "however , the median absolute deviations were 6.34@xmath810@xmath15 for the archival data and",
    "5.13@xmath810@xmath15 for the new data , so the difference in the medians is not a significant change .",

    "we obtained measurements of core , jet , and total fractional polarization .",
    "of these , only the core fractional polarization yielded interesting results .",
    "we detected polarization in the cores of 80% ( 72 of 90 ) of the sources for which we had observations in two epochs .",
    "of our 90 sources , 48 showed higher core fractional polarization in the new data than the archival data .",
    "this includes 17 bl lac objects , 28 fsrqs , and 3 agn / other objects .",
    "only 15 sources had no polarized flux in their cores in both epochs .",
    "twenty - seven of our sources showed a decrease in core fractional polarization in the new data including 11 bl lac objects , 12 fsrqs , and 4 agn / other objects .",
    "of the objects that showed a decrease in core fractional polarization , only 3 ( 1 bl lac object and 2 fsrqs ) were detected as polarized in the archival data and had no polarized flux in the core in the new data .",

    "( 2007 ) to classify our sources by appearance for comparison with the vips sample .",
    "we also went through them by eye and reclassified any objects that the script misidentified .",

    "the widely accepted picture of agn central engine is a spinning super - massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk ( blandford 1976 , lovelace 1976 , urry & padovani 1995 ) . in order to launch and collimate the jets ,",
    "most models include a strong magnetic field which is coiled into a helical shape by the rotation of the accretion disk or the black hole .",
    "meier ( 2005 ) proposed a model where the magnetic field lines originate in the accretion disk and then thread through the ergosphere ( the region near a rotating black hole where spacetime itself is rotating as a result of frame dragging ) of the rotating central black hole .",
    "this allows for the black hole to tightly wind the magnetic field lines , leading to reconnection events which can launch fast - moving material .",
    "this may be the source of the @xmath0-ray emitting regions in our blazars .",
    "we know that strong , uniform magnetic fields lead to polarized emission .",
    "because the majority ( 76% ) of our @xmath0-ray bright sources showed significant polarization in their cores , it is obvious that they have strong , well - ordered magnetic fields in their centers .",
    "the fact that the non - lat sources are polarized less often ( see fig .",
    "[ polbar ] ) leads us to believe that the strong , uniform magnetic fields are somehow tied to the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "also , recall from section 5.3 that the core fractional polarization appeared to increase during lat detection .",
    "furthermore , abdo et al . ( 2010d ) noted a dramatic change in the optical polarization orientation angle coincided with strong @xmath0-ray emission in 3c279 .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the magnetic fields in the cores become stronger ( field lines wound more tightly ) and more uniform ( lines pulled into a less chaotic configuration ) when @xmath0-ray emission occurs .",
    "in other words , following from the model in meier 2005 discussed above , the spinning black hole winds up the magnetic fields lines until there is a reconnection event which launches a new , fast - moving jet component .",
    "this new component upscatters background photons to gev energies via inverse compton processes ( e.g. , bjrnsson 2010 , tavecchio et al .",
    "2011 , abdo et al .",
    "meier ( 2005 ) expected several reconnection events in succession , followed by a time when the field has pulled back from the black hole .",
    "thus , the objects for which we do not detect polarization in the core could be in the state where the field is not being wound up by the black hole .      while we did not have a large sample of objects with measured opening angles , we did find a hint that the lat and non - lat distributions are different .",
    "the k - s test gave a 0.4% probability that the lat and non - lat distributions of bl lac object and fsrq opening angles are taken from the same parent sample .",
    "this is not a highly significant result , but it is tantalizing in view of what other studies have reported ( e.g. , pushkarev et al .",
    "2009 ; ojha et al .",
    "2010b ; lister et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the only significant difference between the lat and non - lat bl lac objects was that the lat bl lacs are polarized more often . however , 10 of the 24 non - lat bl lac objects showed significant core polarization , so core polarization itself is not enough to separate the two populations .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that all bl lacs produce @xmath0-rays , but we simply do not detect all of them with the lat",
    ". it is well known that bl lac objects are highly variable sources in radio and @xmath0-ray bands ( abdo et al .",
    "it is possible that lat does not detect some bl lac objects because they have lower than average doppler factors , either as a result of lower velocities and/or jet orientations further from the line - of - sight .",
    "lister et al . ( 2009c ) measured the kinematics of both lat and non - lat bl lac objects , and found two non - lat bl lac objects with maximum jet material speeds higher than the lat bl lac objects .",
    "however , they only had 21 bl lac objects , 10 of which were lat - detected . further study of bl lac object kinematics is needed before we can claim lat bl lacs tend to have higher bulk material velocities .",
    "it is also possible that bl lac objects occasionally enter a state where @xmath0-ray production ceases or is at least significantly reduced .",
    "this question may be answered with continued monitoring of bl lac objects with lat and future instruments .",
    "the lat fsrqs exhibited several significant differences from the non - lat fsrqs .",
    "the lat fsrqs had higher radio flux densities , higher core brightness temperatures , and were polarized much more often than the non - lat fsrqs .",
    "the lat fsrqs also seemed to have higher jet brightness temperatures , although this is a marginal result .",
    "it is also possible that the lat fsrqs have larger opening angles than non - lat fsrqs , but this result is tentative and is not strongly supported by the k - s test .    as with the bl lac objects",
    ", we saw significant variation in flux density , core brightness temperature , and core polarization for those sources for which we had two epochs of observations .",
    "however , as a group the fsrqs did not change significantly in flux density or core brightness temperature between the two epochs .",
    "we did find an increase in the number of sources with strong core polarization .",
    "about 90% ( 96 of 107 ) of the lat fsrqs showed significant polarization in their cores .",
    "compare this with only about 33% of the non - lat fsrqs showing core polarization , and we can see that core polarization is a strong indicator of @xmath0-ray emission . of the 44 fsrqs for which we had observations in two epochs , 28 showed higher core fractional polarization during lat detection .",
    "only 12 showed a decrease in core fractional polarization .",
    "so , it appears that the cores of fsrqs tend to become more polarized during lat detection .",
    "we found two significant differences between the lat and non - lat non - blazar agn .",
    "the first is the total radio flux density .",
    "the lat non - blazar agn tended to have higher flux density than their non - lat counterparts .",
    "the k - s test resulted in a 8.8@xmath810@xmath32 chance that the lat and non - lat distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "second , the lat non - blazar agn are polarized much more frequently .",
    "we detected polarization in about 43% ( 13 of 30 ) of our lat sources , compared to only about 20% ( 102 of 515 ) for our non - lat sample .",
    "as with the bl lac objects and fsrqs , the non - blazar agn are not necessarily more strongly polarized , but polarized more often .",
