    "jet quenching , i.e.  the energy loss of hard partons created in the first moments of a heavy ion collision due to interactions with the surrounding soft medium has long been regarded a promising tool to study properties of the soft medium @xcite . the basic idea is to study the changes induced by the medium to a hard process which is well - known from p - p collisions .",
    "a number of observables is available for this purpose , among them suppression in single inclusive hard hadron spectra @xmath0 @xcite , the suppression of back - to - back correlations @xcite , single hadron suppression as a function of the emission angle with the reaction plane @xcite and most recently also preliminary measurements of jets have become available @xcite .",
    "single hadron observables and back - to - back correlations are well described in detailed model calculations using the concept of energy loss @xcite , i.e. under the assumption that the process can be described by a medium - induced shift of the leading parton energy by an amount @xmath1 , followed by a fragmentation process using vacuum fragmentation of a parton with the reduced energy .",
    "however , there are also calculations for these observables in which the evolution of the whole in - medium parton shower is followed in an analytic way @xcite . recently , also monte carlo ( mc ) codes for in - medium shower evolution have become available @xcite which are based on mc shower simulations developed for hadronic collisions , such as pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite . in medium - modified shower computations , energy is not simply lost but redistributed in a characteristic way .",
    "all current in - medium shower mc codes model the interaction between partons and the medium in a different way .",
    "jewel ( jet evolution with energy loss ) @xcite assumes either elastic collisions with thermal quasiparticles or , to implement radiative energy loss , an enhancement of the singular part of the parton branching kernels .",
    "yajem ( yet another jet energy - loss model ) @xcite makes the assumption that the virtuality of partons traversing the medium grows according to the medium transport coefficient @xmath2 which measures the virtuality gain per unit pathlength , and this medium - induced virtuality leads to increased radiation .",
    "finally , q - pythia , the code presented in @xcite is a direct extension of the leading parton energy loss computations done in @xcite and uses the differential radiation probabilities originally computed from a single hard parton now for each parton propagating in the shower simulation . at this stage , it is hardly surprising that different models employ different implementations of the parton - medium interaction , as the nature of this interaction crucially depends on the microscopic properties of the medium , i.e. the very thing one wishes to determine from the experiments .",
    "a suitable strategy to determine these properties is thus to study the effects of various different implementations of the parton - medium interaction for different observables . in this paper",
    ", we begin such a program by investigating the effects on a number of different observables resulting from three different scenarios : medium - induced radiation by an increase of parton virtuality dependent on the medium @xmath2 as used in @xcite , an enhancement of the singular parts of the branching kernel leading to additional radiation as used in @xcite and a drag force .",
    "momentum - dependent drag forces appear in computations modelling qcd - like @xmath3 super yang - mills theories via the ads / cft conjecture @xcite , in the present paper we use a simplified ansatz in which a parton in a constant medium undergoes a momentum independent energy loss per unit pathlength .",
    "such a drag term has not been tested in an in - medium shower evolution mc code previously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we briefly review the computation of medium - modified hadron jet as done in @xcite . in addition",
    ", we describe the three different implementations of the parton - medium interaction and its relation to the spacetime structure of the shower in detail .",
    "in a first comparison , we make the connection to previous leading parton energy loss calculations by considering a constant medium with fixed length . in this medium",
    ", we study the energy loss of the leading parton and present the result in terms of energy loss probability distributions and mean energy loss as a function of the parameters characterizing the medium . in a second comparison , we turn to a medium model which is closer to the experimental situation in so far as it expands and hence dilutes as a function of time .",
    "we compute various jet observables in this medium , such as the longitudinal momentum distribuion inside the jet or the angular broadening .",
    "finally , in a last comparison we compute ( as done in @xcite ) the suppression of the inclusive single hard hadron spectrum in terms of the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 and compare all scenarios with experimental results @xcite . from this comparison",
    ", we tentatively deduce the relevant medium parameters .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of the results .",
    "in this section , we describe how the medium - modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) is obtained from a computation of an in - medium shower followed by hadronization .",
    "key ingredient for this computation is a pqcd mc shower algorithm . in this work ,",
    "we employ a modification of the pythia shower algorithm pyshow @xcite . in the absence of any medium effects",
    ", our algorithm therefore corresponds directly to the pythia shower .",
    "furthermore , the subsequent hadronization of the shower is assumed to take place outside of the medium , even if the shower itself was medium - modified .",
    "it is computed using the lund string fragmentation scheme @xcite which is also part of pythia .",
    "we model the evolution from some initial , highly virtual parton to a final state parton shower as a series of branching processes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is called the parent parton and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are referred to as daughters . in qcd ,",
    "the allowed branching processes are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the kinematics of a branching is described in terms of the virtuality scale @xmath11 and of the energy fraction @xmath12 , where the energy of daughter @xmath6 is given by @xmath13 and of the daughter @xmath7 by @xmath14 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale parameter of qcd .",
    "@xmath17 takes a role similar to a time in the evolution equations , as it describes the evolution from some high initial virtuality @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) to a lower virtuality @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) at which the next branching occurs . in terms of the two variables ,",
    "the differential probability @xmath22 for a parton @xmath5 to branch is @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the strong coupling and the splitting kernels @xmath25 read    @xmath26    where we do not consider electromagnetic branchings .",
    "@xmath27 counts the number of active quark flavours for given virtuality .    at a given value of the scale @xmath17 ,",
    "the differential probability for a branching to occur is given by the integral over all allowed values of @xmath12 in the branching kernel as    @xmath28    the kinematically allowed range of @xmath12 is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 with @xmath31 the bare quark mass or zero in the case of a gluon .",
    "given the initial parent virtuality @xmath32 or equivalently @xmath33 , the virtuality at which the next branching occurs can be determined with the help of the sudakov form factor @xmath34 , i.e. the probability that no branching occurs between @xmath19 and @xmath21 , where    @xmath35.\\ ] ]    thus , the probability density that a branching of @xmath5 occurs at @xmath21 is given by    @xmath36 s_a(t).\\ ] ]    these equations are solved for each branching by the pyshow algorithm @xcite iteratively to generate a shower . for each branching first eq .",
    "( [ e - qsq ] ) is solved to determine the scale of the next branching , then eqs .",
    "( [ e - qqg])-([e - gqq ] ) are evaluated to determine the type of branching and the value of @xmath12 , if the value of @xmath12 is outside the kinematic bound given by eq .",
    "( [ e - kb ] ) then the event is rejected .",
    "given @xmath37 and @xmath12 , energy - momentum conservation determines the rest of the kinematics except for a radial angle by which the plane spanned by the vectors of the daughter parents can be rotated .    in order to account in a schematic way for higher order interference terms ,",
    "angular ordering is enforced onto the shower , i.e. opening angles spanned between daughter pairs @xmath38 from a parent @xmath5 are enforced to decrease according to the condition    @xmath39    after a branching process has been computed , the same algorithm is applied to the two daughter partons treating them as new mothers .",
    "the branching is continued down to a scale @xmath40 which is set to 1 gev in the mc simulation , after which the partons are set on - shell , adjusting transverse momentum to ensure energy - momentum conservation .",
    "after all possible branchings have been performed , i.e. after for all partons the condition @xmath41 has been reached , the resulting parton shower is connected with a string following the lund scheme @xcite which is subsequently allowed to decay into hadrons . these hadrons form the observable jet , and analyzing the distribution of hadrons , we may for example determine the fragmentation function @xmath42 , i.e. the distribution of hadron species @xmath43 with an energy @xmath44 originating from a shower initiating parton @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the whole energy of the jet .      while the vacuum shower evolution equations above are solved in momentum space only , the interaction with the medium requires modelling of the shower evolution in position space as well , because the medium properties in a general medium change as a function of the position space variables . usually , these are given in the c.m .",
    "frame of the collision in terms of the spacetime rapidity @xmath47 , the radius @xmath48 , the proper time @xmath49 and the angle @xmath50 , and knowledge of the medium evolution implies knowledge of medium properties such as the local medium temperature @xmath51 in the form @xmath52 .    in order to make the link from momentum space to momentum space , we assume that the average formation time of a shower parton with virtuality @xmath53 is developed on the timescale @xmath54",
    ", i.e. the average lifetime of a virtual parton with virtuality @xmath55 coming from a parent parton with virtuality @xmath56 is in the rest frame of the original hard collision ( the local rest frame of the medium may be different by a flow boost as the medium may not be static ) given by    @xmath57    going beyond the ansatz of @xcite where we used this average formation time for all partons , in the present work we assume that the actual formation time can be obtained from a probability distribution    @xmath58\\ ] ]    which we sample to determine the actual formation time of the fluctuation in each branching .",
    "this establishes the temporal structure of the shower . with regard to the spatial structure , we make the simplifying assumption that all partons probe the medium along the eikonal trajectory of the shower initiating parton , i.e. we neglect the small difference of the velocity of massive partons to the speed of light and possible ( equally small ) changes of medium properties within the spread of the shower partons transverse to its axis .      in the following ,",
    "we assume that any effect of the medium will affect the partonic stage of the evolution , but not the hadronization .",
    "this is equivalent to the idea that hadronization takes place outside the medium , an assumption commonly made also for leading parton energy loss calculations .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be dicussed below .",
    "we use three different scenarios to model the interaction of partons with the medium .",
    "the first one , in the following referred to as rad , has been used previously in @xcite .",
    "the relevant property of the medium probed is the transport coefficient @xmath59 which represents the virtuality gain @xmath60 per unit pathlength of a parton traversing the medium .",
    "note that this represents an average transfer , i.e.  a picture which would be realized in a medium which is characterized by multiple soft scatterings with the hard parton .",
    "however , unlike in @xcite the virtuality transfer to a shower parton is randomized in the present work since the formation time is distributed randomly around its average .",
    "thus , effectively the present scenario includes the possibility to have both a small formation time and hence a small virtuality gain and a large formation time corresponding to a more substantial increase in virtuality .    in practice",
    ", we increase the virtuality of a shower parton @xmath5 propagating through a medium with specified @xmath59 by    @xmath61    where the time @xmath62 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e - rlifetime ] ) , the time @xmath63 is known in the simulation as the endpoint of the previous branching process and the integration @xmath64 is along the eikonal trajectory of the shower - initiating parton .",
    "if the parton is a gluon , the virtuality transfer from the medium is increased by the ratio of their casimir color factors , @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 , holds , i.e. the virtuality picked up from the medium is a correction to the initial parton virtuality , we may add @xmath67 to the virtuality of parton @xmath5 before using eq .",
    "( [ e - qsq ] ) to determine the kinematics of the next branching .",
    "if the condition is not fulfilled , the lifetime is determined by @xmath68 and may be significantly shortened by virtuality picked up from the medium . in this case",
    "we iterate eqs .",
    "( [ e - lifetime]),([e - qgain ] ) to determine a self - consistent pair of @xmath69 .",
    "this ensures that on the level of averages , the lifetime is treated consistently with the virtuality picked up from the medium .",
    "the actual lifetime is still determined by eq .",
    "( [ e - rlifetime ] ) .    in a second scenario , in the following called drag , we assume that the medium exerts a drag force on each propagating parton",
    ". the medium is thus characterized by a drag coefficient @xmath70 which describes the energy loss per unit pathlength .    in the simulation , the energy ( and momentum )",
    "are reduced by    @xmath71    again , for a gluon the energy loss is increased by the color factor ratio 2.25 . as in the previous case ,",
    "the energy loss induced by the drag force is randomized even given the branching kinematics due to the randomized formation time of a branching .",
    "the third scenario has been suggested in @xcite . in the following",
    ", it is referred to as fmed . here",
    ", the modification does not concern the parton kinematics , but rather the evolution kernel , eqs .",
    "( [ e - qqg][e - gqq ] ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the singular part of the branching kernel in the medium is enhanced by a factor @xmath72 , e.g. eq .  ( [ e - qqg ] ) becomes in the medium    @xmath73    the effect of the medium is thus summarized in the value of @xmath74 .",
    "note that in the fmed scenario , no explicit reference to the spacetime structure of the shower is made , in this sense , the scenario is rather different from the other two .",
    "note that in the rad scenario the shower _ gains _ energy from the medium by means of the virtuality increase , in the drag scenario the shower _ loses _ energy to the medium whereas the shower energy is conserved in the fmed scenario .",
    "while this appears surprising at first , it is actually rather a matter of book - keeping . for a shower in the medium",
    ", there is no conceptual way to separate soft partons from the shower and from the medium .",
    "however , the model framework outlined above does not treat the medium as consisting of partons , but rather as an effective influence on the shower .",
    "thus , in a more realistic model one would define a criterion ( say a momentum scale ) based on which partons are removed from the shower and become part of the medium .",
    "in such a model , all three scenarios would lead to a loss of energy from the shower to the medium through the appearance of soft partons in the evolution , in addition to possible other mechanisms of energy transfer to the medium .",
    "in this section , we perform several computations for the simple case of a constant medium with fixed pathlength .",
    "this is chiefly done in order to establish the relation of the models outlined above to older computations based on leading parton energy loss .",
    "a constant medium corresponds to a choice of a single value of @xmath75 or @xmath74 .",
    "however , in the case of both the rad and the drag scenario , also the medium length @xmath76 has to be specified , thus in principle the medium is characterized by two parameters . in @xcite",
    "however we found an approximate scaling law for the rad scenario according to which the modification chiefly depends on the virtuality picked up along the eikonal path of the shower initiating parton @xmath77 or in the case of a constant medium simply @xmath78 .",
    "a similar scaling law can also be established for the drag scenario , albeit only in the case of an expanding medium ( see below ) .",
    "whenever such a scaling law holds , a comparison between the different scenarios can be made based on the single parameter @xmath79 or @xmath80 only .",
    "it is clear that the scaling can not work for all the possible functional forms @xmath81 . in two different limits",
    "this can be made plausible : if , in the rad scenario , @xmath79 is added at once initially , @xmath82 is for reasonable values of hard process kinematics and medium properties very small .",
    "for example , for typical rhic kinematics the initial @xmath11 from which the evolution starts may be 400 gev@xmath83 whereas the total virtuality acquired for a parton traversing the whole medium is about 15 gev@xmath83 according to the results of @xcite .",
    "however , such a small correction will not influence the shower evolution significantly . on the other hand , if the virtuality is added later when the typical @xmath11 is of order of @xmath60 , a much stronger modification is expected .",
    "thus , one expects the scaling law to be violated into the direction of less medium effect if @xmath81 is strongly peaked towards @xmath84 .",
    "a similar argument , can be made for the drag scenario .",
    "the drag force acts on every parton in the shower .",
    "this means that if @xmath85 is strongly peaked towards @xmath84 , then the drag force acts only on one parton , the shower initiator , whereas if it is applied later , its effect is felt by several partons .    on the other hand , note that the shower evolution is terminated for every parton which reaches @xmath86 gev@xmath83 .",
    "this implies that the typical lifetime of the shower for an initial parton with energy @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 , thus a shower with @xmath89 gev probes the medium on average for a distance of 4 fm ( eq .",
    "( [ e - rlifetime ] ) leads to fluctuations around this average though ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath76 is chosen much beyond @xmath90 , @xmath91 or @xmath92 are not good parameters any more , as the shower does not effectively probe the whole medium .",
    "the latter effect is clearly not related to an actual physics effect but rather an artefact of the need to switch to a non - perturbative description of hadronization at some point in the simulation .",
    "it is unreasonable that a parton ( or proto - hadron ) would feel no effect from the medium just because its virtuality is small , however it is unclear just how the effect should be implemented properly in the present framework .",
    "the behaviour of the simulation thus depends on the actual choice of @xmath40 , and this needs to be optimized eventually in comparison with data .",
    "a study of the effect of changing @xmath40 will be presented below .    the resulting mmff for a light quark into charged hadrons for constant @xmath91 or @xmath92 and a variation of pathlength is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - scaling1 ] for both the rad and the drag scenario . in a constant medium ,",
    "the rad scenario shows approximate scaling for pathlength between 0.5 and 5 fm . the drag scenario does not exhibit a strong scaling in the region of large @xmath12 , but in the region @xmath93 which is predominantly probed when computing the single hadron spectra , the variations are not too large for pathlengths between 0.5 and 3 fm .",
    "note that neither the short pathlength nor the long pathlength limit is actually problematic for a realistic medium evolution taken from a hydrodynamical model .",
    "the first limit is avoided by virtue of the thermalization time of order @xmath94 fm for rhic kinematics .",
    "this is a large time compared with the timescale in which the first branchings in a shower occur , thus by the time the medium is present , the shower is already well developed .",
    "the second limit is avoided because in an expanding medium @xmath81 or @xmath85 drop rapidly as a function of time , thus the late time contribution to @xmath95 or @xmath96 is small in any case .",
    "thus , the scaling works much better for a realistic evolution as the constant medium results would suggest .",
    "we now proceed to compare the three scenarios on the basis of leading parton energy loss .",
    "this is relevant to make the connection to previous calculations in the bdmps or asw formalism @xcite which are formulated using this concept . for this purpose",
    ", we select the shower initator to be a @xmath7-quark and extract the energy distribution of the leading @xmath7-quark @xmath97 after the shower . from the comparison of the distribution @xmath98 in vacuum and in the medium @xmath99",
    ", we can deduce the energy loss probability distribution @xmath100 .",
    "the idea is to make an ansatz    @xmath101    and solve it for @xmath100 .",
    "note that this ansatz contains the rather drastic assumption that there is no parametric dependence on the initial energy @xmath87 .",
    "if we require @xmath100 to be a probability distribution , the assumption may imply that for some partons in the distribution @xmath98 the energy loss @xmath1 is larger than their energy @xmath87 in which case they have to be considered lost to the medium .",
    "a similar situation also occurs in the application of the asw formalism to finite energy kinematics .",
    "the problem of the validity of assuming energy independence however only concern the comparison with the asw results in which energy loss is formulated in terms of a probability density @xmath100 . in all other results presented in this manuscript ,",
    "the full information of the shower including finite energy kinematics is used and no assumption about energy independence of energy loss needs to be made .",
    "the choice of a @xmath7-quark as shower initiator has a twofold motivation .",
    "first , it allows to define energy loss in the same way as done in the asw formalism .",
    "note that the asw formalism assumes infinite parent parton energy and calculates energy loss via the radiation spectrum off the parent . in applying the formalism to finite energy ,",
    "a process may occur in which a radiated gluon takes 90% of the energy of an initial quark @xmath102 .",
    "this energy is then considered to be lost from the @xmath102 .",
    "however , in the shower language , the radiated gluon would in this case become the _ new _ leading parton , and even tagging the leading quark out of a shower would not prevent processes where this gluon splits into a @xmath103 pair where the new quark @xmath104 might still be harder as the original parent @xmath102 of the gluon .",
    "the choice of a @xmath7 quark as shower initiator effectively suppresses such processes and allows to treat energy loss as closely as possible to asw @xcite .",
    "the second advantage of extracting @xmath100 from a @xmath7 quark is that the @xmath7-fragmentation is rather hard , i.e. the probability distribution to find the leading @xmath7-quark after a vacuum shower peaks close to @xmath105 .",
    "this effectively means that if one considers an additional , medium - induced shift in energy , most of the energy range is still available for the dominant part of the distribution .",
    "this is very different for a light quark shower where the leading quark distribution typically peaks at @xmath93 and any energy loss of @xmath106 shifts the bulk of the distribution into the unphysical region of negative energies .    in fig .",
    "[ f - cdist ] we show the leading charm distributions both in vacuum and in medium for a medium pathlength of @xmath107 fm . in order to make a meaningful comparison between the different scenarios , the average relative energy loss @xmath108",
    "is fixed to 10% or 20% respectively .    in order to deduce the energy loss probability distribution from these results",
    ", we have to solve eq .",
    "( [ e - folding ] ) . by discretizing the integral over @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ e - folding ] ) we can cast it into the form of a matrix equation    @xmath109    where @xmath97 is provided at @xmath110 discrete values of @xmath87 labelled @xmath111 and @xmath100 is probed at @xmath112 discrete values of @xmath1 labelled @xmath113 .",
    "the kernel @xmath114 is then the calculated @xmath97 for all pairs @xmath115 where the energy loss acts as a shift of the distribution , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "( [ e - matrix ] ) can in principle be solved for the vector @xmath113 by inversion of @xmath114 for @xmath117 . however , in general this does not guarantee that the result is a probability distribution . especially in the face of statistical errors and finite numerical accuracy",
    "the direct matrix inversion may permit negative @xmath113 which have no probabilistic interpretation .",
    "thus , a more promising solution which avoids the above problems is to let @xmath118 and find the vector @xmath119 which minimizes @xmath120 subject to the constraints @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this guarantees that the outcome can be interpreted as a probability distribution and since the system of equations is overdetermined for @xmath123 errors on individual points @xmath124 do not have a critical influence on the outcome any more .",
    "this is the approach we have chosen .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath107 fm in fig .",
    "[ f - pdeltae ] . qualitatively ,",
    "both the radiative energyloss scenarios rad and fmed produce energy loss probability distributions which are similar to the asw quenching weights @xcite in the sense that they are flat across a wide range in @xmath1 . in contrast , the drag scenario produces a localized peak in the energy loss distribution which reminds of the quenching weights found for elastic energy loss scenarios @xcite . especially for larger energy loss , the rad and the fmed scenario lead to almost identical results .",
    "however , there is an important difference to the asw quenching weights : while the asw results typically show a large discrete probability for no energy loss , the results obtained here show no substantial strength in the first bin ( the inversion procedure outlined above can not separate zero energy loss from small energy loss ) .      in order to gain more insight into the different scenarios , we investigate in fig .",
    "[ f - de ] for a constant medium with @xmath107 fm how the mean energy loss , defined as @xmath125 with @xmath100 obtained as in the previous section behaves as a function of the relevant medium parameters .",
    "we include a scenario in which the strong coupling constant is not allowed to run with the virtuality scale in the shower ( as is the default option in pyshow ) but is kept fixed at @xmath126 .",
    "there is no unique way to present and compare the results , as the three relevant parameters @xmath75 and @xmath74 are rather different .",
    "however , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ f - de ] , it is possible to find a simple proportionality relation between @xmath2 and @xmath74 such that the rise of the mean energy loss appears very similar .",
    "this , in addition to the similarity of @xmath100 for both the rad and the fmed scenario points towards some generic properties of radiative energy loss scenarios independent of the details of the implementation .",
    "in particular , the rad and the fmed scenario exhibit saturation of the mean induced energy loss at about 25% of the total energy as the medium effect is increased .",
    "this saturation is even more pronounced for a constent @xmath24 . in striking contrast ,",
    "the drag scenario in which energy is directly transferred to the medium shows an almost linear rise up to mean energy losses of 50% .",
    "note that the extraction of the energy loss probability based on discretization and matrix inversion as outlined above becomes increasingly problematic at @xmath127 due to the problem of partons being shifted to negative energies mentioned above .",
    "we now turn to a more realistic scenario in which the parton propagates in a medium as created in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "relativistic fluid - dynamical models such as @xcite give a good description of many bulk properties of the medium , hence in the following we will assume that hydrodynamics is a valid description of the medium .",
    "both the finite size and the finite lifetime of such a medium are felt by the parton . in particular ,",
    "the local density may drop a ) because of a spatial variation , i.e. the parton reaches the medium edge and b ) a temporal variation , i.e. the global expansion of the medium reduces the overall density as a function of time .",

    "we adopt a more realistic approach in which we increase the medium effect linearly from zero at @xmath84 to its value reached at @xmath145 . the idea behind this",

    "this is the region of the fragmentation function which is predominantly probed when the fragmentation function is folded with a pqcd parton spectrum to compute single inclusive hadron production .",

    "both the radiative scenarios rad and fmed show the expected enhancement of the distribution , but the drag scenario is strikingly different  it falls below the vacuum result .",
    "however , this is hardly surprising , as in this scenario energy is taken away from the evolving shower and is hence not available for hadron production .",
    "while a measurement of @xmath162 would appear to be a promising means to distinguish between induced radiation and a drag force as the microscopic realization of energy loss , it has to be pointed out that there are two things which urge some caution .",
    "first , the lund scheme used to model hadronization in the present framework assumes that hadronization takes place far outside the medium .",
    "if the energy of a hadron @xmath43 of mass @xmath164 is @xmath165 , the spatial scale at which hadronization occurs can be estimated as @xmath166 . for pions , this is not a problem throughout the kinematic range , but for kaons and protons the hadronization length is considerably shortened .",
    "even a 10 gev proton has only @xmath167 fm , thus heavy hadron production in the high @xmath163 region is not addressed adequately in the model , as one can not safely assume hadronization takes place outside the medium where the lund model is applicable . nevertheless , since pions constitute the bulk of charged hadron production , the essential features of the model are expected to be robust .",
    "the second issue concerns the effect of trigger bias .",
    "a series of experimental cuts has to be imposed on events in heavy - ion collisions to discriminate hadrons belonging to jets from the background of soft medium hadrons .",
    "however , strongly modified jets ( for example those emerging from the medium center ) are less likely to fall within the cuts than unmodified jets ( such as those from the medium edge ) . as a result there is a trigger bias which suppresses events in which a modification of @xmath162 is visible .",
    "a calculation in the rad scenario taking into account a realistic series of experimental cuts has been performed in @xcite and found that there should be no visible enhancement if jets are identified directly via a standard set of cuts .      another possibility to identify",
    "the mechanism of the parton - medium interaction is to study the structure of the jet transverse to the jet axis .",
    "this is reflected e.g. in the angular distribution of hadrons around the jet axis .",
    "the distribution @xmath168 where @xmath50 is the angle between hadron and jet axis for @xmath169 gev@xmath83 ( the parameters in the other scenarios adjusted accordingly ) for the vacuum and the three different scenarios is shown in fig .",

    "it is apparent from the figure that the radiative energy loss scenarios again roughly agree with each other and lead to angular broadening of the jet as compared to the vacuum result , whereas the drag scenario shows no indication for broadening .      for a constant medium",
    ", we noted earlier that there is a sensitivity to the choice of the minimum virtuality scale @xmath40 at which partons in the shower are evolved further . before comparing the results of this section to data , it is reasonable to ask to what extent a choice of @xmath40 different from its default value @xmath170 gev has an influence on the results .    in fig .",

    "it is evident from the figure that a lower @xmath40 does not substantially influence the shape of the resulting mmff , but that at least for rhic kinematics , a lower choice of @xmath40 can be compensated by assuming a different choice of the medium parameters .",
    "it is thus not possible to extract definite values for @xmath2 or @xmath150 from a mode fit to measured single hadron spectra , rather only pairs @xmath173 can be determined .",
    "in this section , we aim at comparing with experimental data .",
    "this implies that neither initial position nor initial momentum nor type of the shower initiating parton are known .",
    "the probabilities to find a given parton type with given momentum have to be computed in pqcd whereas the probability to produce a parton at a given vertex position can be found from overlap calculations .",
    "note that the need to average over position and initial momentum corresponds to a substantial increase in mc computing time which could not be done without using the scaling laws .",
    "we begin the analysis by showing how to compute the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 using the medium - modified fragmentation function in the hydrodynamically evolving medium . for this",

    "the most striking observation is that all three scenarios are surprisingly similar and could not possibly be distinguished by current data for @xmath0 .",
    "most notably , all scenarios exhibit a _ falling _ trend as @xmath178 where scenarios based on leading parton energy loss typically exhibit a _ rising _ trend ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite , this property was tentatively attributed to the fact that a description of the whole shower keeps track of multiple soft hadron production .",
    "it was also suggested that the same physics underlies the enhancement of @xmath162 in the large @xmath163 region and the falling of @xmath0 with @xmath178 .",
    "however , the present investigation shows that both ideas must be discarded , as the drag scenario in which no enhanced soft hadron production occurs shows also no enhancement of @xmath162 , but the same falling trend of @xmath0 with @xmath178 as the other scenarios .",
    "thus , the falling trend is not a phenomenon characteristic of radiative energy loss but substantially more general . it also has been observed in other models where a modification of the whole shower by the medium was considered , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .    in order to gain greater insight into the differences between scenarios which compute energy loss for the leading parton and between those where",
    "the whole shower evolution is modified by the medium , we present a schematic comparison between the mmffs in the rad , the drag and the asw scenario in fig .",
    "[ f - aswcomp ] ( the fmed scenario , being in essence indistinguishable from the rad scenario is not shown here ) .",
    "it has been pointed out repeatedly ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the asw scenario applied to rhic kinematics in essence leads to complete absorption of about 75% of all partons , @xmath207 15% emerge without any energy loss and only a small fraction is found after finite energy loss . to good approximation , the mmff in the asw scenario is thus just a downward shift of the vacuum baseline .",
    "this has been done in fig .",
    "[ f - aswcomp ] where all parameters have been adjusted such that the curves agree at @xmath208 .",
    "it is obvious that the shape of the schematic asw result is quite different fron the other scenarios .",
    "in particular , the difference between rad and drag is much less pronounced than between either of those and asw .",
    "it is in essence given by the presence or absence of soft hadron production and confined to the region @xmath209 .",
    "thus , it appears that the different curvature of @xmath154 at @xmath210 is responsible for the rising vs. falling trend in @xmath0 , and thus the way the high @xmath178 end of the shower evolves rather than low @xmath178 hadron production are seen in the data .    at present",
    ", the falling trend seems not to be supported by the data .",
    "should this be confirmed by more precise measurements , presumably the possibility of complete absorptions of partons by the medium needs to be introduced into the simulation of in - medium shower evolution .",
    "we can use the above results to tentatively extract medium properties . in the rad scenario",
    ", @xmath129 is a dimensionless parameter and from the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ f - raacomp ] the value @xmath211 is found .",

    "( [ e - rlifetime ] ) ) has been performed and that the effect of the medium prior to thermalization has been included in a schematic way .",
    "these two differences account for the changed value of @xmath129 .    with this value of @xmath129 , @xmath213 ,",
    "i.e. the highest transport coefficient reached in the evolution in the medium center at thermalization time of 0.6 fm / c is found to be 15.6 gev@xmath83/fm when @xmath214 gev is assumed . for @xmath171 gev , the extracted value of@xmath129 changes to 1.4 and @xmath215 gev@xmath83/fm .",

    "while these numbers appear large , it has to be remembered that they reflect a snapshot of the medium at its peak density , from which the energy density drops rapidly as a function of time due to the expansion .",

    "we have presented a comparison study of three different mechanisms for the parton - medium interaction in the framework of an in - medium shower evolution . in this study , we have considered a variety of assumptions about the evolution of the medium , among them a constant medium with different length @xmath76 , an evolving medium for parths from the medium center , paths from the medium surface and an average over all possible paths in the medium .",

    "some generic properties can be identified .",
    "@xmath219 the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 is not a good observable to distinguish different scenarios of the microscopical interaction of partons with the medium .",
    "this statement has been made previously from different angles ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the present results merely confirm previous findings in yet another framework .",
    "more differential observables are needed to determine the nature of parton - medium interaction .",
    "@xmath219 the falling trend of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath178 is apparently unrelated to low @xmath178 multi hadron production and rather a generic feature observed in models which do not consider energy loss from a leading parton but rather a modification of the whole shower .",
    "for example , the results of the higher twist approach applied to the leading parton show a rising trend of @xmath0 with @xmath178 @xcite , however when resummed in the shower evolution equations and applied to the whole shower , the higher twist approach leads to a falling trend @xcite , i.e. the same observation is made in quite a different framework .",
    "if future data confirm a rising trend , non - trivial modifications to the shower evolution codes , such as the possibility of complete parton absorption by the medium , need to be considered .",
    "@xmath219 the properties of medium - induced radiation as a mechanism for the parton - medium interaction appear rather generic .",
    "there is no observable in this study in which the rad and the fmed scenarios lead to substantially different results .",
    "the useful implication would be that in many observables it is really the underlying physics mechanism one is probing , not technical details of how this mechanism is implemented in a particular model .",
    "@xmath219 in contrast , a different physics mechanism as exemplified here by the drag scenario appears distinct in several quantities .",
    "not only is its excitation function in terms of mean energy loss as a function of medium density different than for radiative scenarios ( which could be tested by variations in collision centrality ) , but also the absence of soft hadron production induces pronounced effects in jet observables such as the angular distribution of hadrons around the jet axis or the hump - backed plateau .",
    "however , the need to identify a jet in a heavy - ion collision above the soft background introduces additional complications .",
    "in essence , a medium - modified jet has properties different from a jet in vacuum and is hence less likely to be identified as jet .",
    "a measurement of jets must be carefully designed to avoid this trigger bias which tends to hide the very effect one would like to study @xcite .",
    "@xmath219 technical aspects of the modelling , such as the choice of @xmath40 or the randomization of the formation time as investigated here , do not appear to change the results qualitatively .",
    "however , there is a substantial ambiguity once one tries to extract quantitative medium parameters from the computation , especially when this extaction is based on a single observable .",
    "as is the case for vacuum shower codes , the relevant technical model parameters should eventually be determined by the best fit to a large body of data .",
    "there are several more properties of the parton - medium interaction which could be exploited to distinguish different scenarios .",
    "a very promising candidate is the pathlength dependence of the medium effect .",
    "experimentally , this can be varied moderately by considering the nuclear suppression as a function of the angle of hard hadron with the reaction plane @xcite or more strongly by considering back - to - back correlations ( which however require a careful modelling , as the relevant geometry arises as a complicated function of the geometrical bias of the energy loss on the trigger hadron itself @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite is was argued based on the different pathlength dependence that elastic energy loss can not be responsible for the suppression of hard back - to - back hadron correlations .    in the present paper , we have refrained from making any comparison based on pathlength dependence .",
    "such a study ( which is quite substantial on its own ) along with a comparison with the experimental results on back - to - back correlations and the variation of the suppression as a function of the reaction plane angle will be the topic of a future publication .",
    "the study presented here shows that jet observables are more powerful in order to distinguish different microscopical physics process of the parton - medium interaction than observables which are only sensitive to the leading hadron .",
    "however , the need to identify a jet above the background medium may quickly eliminate this advantage , at which point one has to resort to what has been termed the golden channel  @xmath220-jet correlations in which the presence of a photon not only allows to get an unbiased jet sample but also reveals the kinematic of the jet .",
    "unfortunately , due to the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling , the statistics in this channel is poor and the measurement is difficult .",
    "future jet measurements at rhic may overcome this problem by high luminosity , whereas future measurements at lhc where the scale separation between a hard process and the soft medium is considerably larger than at rhic may not suffer significantly from trigger bias at all .",
    "there is now good reason to assume that jet observables will reveal important information about the microscopical properties of the medium , and monte carlo simulations of in - medium showers such as yajem or jewel will most likely be the appropriate tools to extract this information ."
