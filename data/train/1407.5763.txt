    "this is puzzling , because there are no explicit collision effects in either the tdks equation or in the thermal model in the adiabatic meta - gga which we adopted .",

    "<S> we calculate the dielectric response of excited crystalline silicon in electron thermal equilibrium by adiabatic time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) to model the response to irradiation by high - intensity laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the dielectric function is characterized by the strong negative behavior at low frequencies due to excited electron - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the response agrees rather well with the numerical pump - probe calculations which simulate electronic excitations in nonequilibrium phase immediately after the laser pulse irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal response is also compared with the drude model which includes electron effective mass and collision time as fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extracted effective masses are in the range of 0.22 - 0.36 and lifetimes are in the range of 1 - 14 fs depending on the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the short drude lifetimes show that strong damping is possible in the adiabatic tddft , despite the absence of explicit electron - electron collisions . </S>"
