    "twitter and other social media have become important communication channels for the general public .",
    "it is thus not surprising that various stakeholder groups in science also participate on these platforms .",
    "scientists , for instance , use twitter for generating research ideas and disseminating and discussing scientific results  @xcite .",
    "many biomedical practitioners use twitter for engaging in continuing education ( e.g. , journal clubs on twitter ) and other community - based purposes  @xcite .",
    "policy makers are active on twitter , opening lines of discourse between scientists and those making policy on science  @xcite .",
    "quantitative investigations of scholarly activities on social media  often called altmetrics  can now be done at scale , given the availability of apis on several platforms , most notably twitter  @xcite .",
    "much of the extant literature has focused on the comparison between the amount of online attention and traditional citations collected by publications , showing low levels of correlation .",
    "such low correlation has been used to argue that altmetrics provide alternative measures of impact , particularly the broader impact on the society  @xcite , given that social media provide open platforms where people with diverse backgrounds can engage in direct conversations without any barriers .",
    "however , this argument has not been empirically grounded , impeding further understanding of the validity of altmetrics and the broader impact of articles .    a crucial step towards empirical validation of",
    "the broader impact claim of altmetrics is to identify scientists on twitter , because altmetric activities are often assumed to be generated by  the public \" rather than scientists , although it is not necessarily the case . to verify this",
    ", we need to be able to identify scientists and non - scientists .",
    "although there have been some attempts , they suffer from a narrow disciplinary focus  @xcite and/or small scale  @xcite .",
    "moreover , most studies use purposive sampling techniques , pre - selecting candidate scientists based on their success in other sources ( e.g. , highly cited in web of science ) , instead of organically finding scientists from the twitter platform itself . such reliance on bibliographic databases binds these studies to traditional citation indicators and thus introduces bias . for instance , this approach overlooks early - career scientists and favors certain disciplines .    here we present the first large - scale and systematic study of scientists across many disciplines on twitter . as our method does not rely on external bibliographic databases and is capable of identifying any user types that are captured in twitter list , it can be adapted to identify other types of stakeholders , occupations , and entities .",
    "we study the demographics of the set of scientists in terms of discipline and gender , finding over - representation of social scientists , under - representation of mathematical and physical scientists , and a better representation of women compared to the statistics from scholarly publishing .",
    "we then analyze the sharing behaviors of scientists , reporting that only a small portion of shared urls are science - related .",
    "finally , we find an assortative mixing with respect to disciplines in the follower , retweet , and mention networks between scientists .",
    "our study serves as a basic building block to study scholarly communication on twitter and the broader impact of altmetrics .",
    "we classify current literature into two main categories , namely _ product_- vs. _ _ producer-__centric perspectives .",
    "the former examines the sharing of scholarly papers in social media and its impact , the latter focuses on who generates the attention .    * product - centric perspective . *",
    "priem and costello formally defined twitter citations as  direct or indirect links from a tweet to a peer - reviewed scholarly article online \" and distinguished between first- and second - order citations based on whether there is an intermediate web page mentioning the article  @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of these links , they argued , would provide a new type of metric , coined as  altmetrics , \" which could measure the broader impact beyond academia of diverse scholarly products  @xcite .",
    "many studies argued that only a small portion of research papers are mentioned on twitter  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a systematic study covering @xmath0 million papers indexed by both pubmed and web of science found that only @xmath1 of them have mentions on twitter  @xcite , yet this is much higher than other social media metrics except mendeley .",
    "the coverages vary across disciplines ; medical and social sciences papers that may be more likely to appeal to a wider public are more likely to be covered on twitter  @xcite .",
    "mixed results have been reported regarding the correlation between altmetrics and citations  @xcite .",
    "a recent meta - analysis showed that the correlation is negligible ( @xmath2 )  @xcite ; however , there is dramatic differences across studies depending on disciplines , journals , and time window .",
    "* producer - centric perspective .",
    "* survey - based studies examined how scholars present themselves on social media  @xcite . a large - scale survey with more than @xmath3 responses conducted by _ nature _ in @xmath4 revealed that more than @xmath5 were aware of twitter , yet only @xmath6 were regular users  @xcite .    a handful of studies analyzed how twitter is used by scientists .",
    "priem and costello examined @xmath7 scholars to study how and why they share scholarly papers on twitter  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of @xmath8 emergency physicians concluded that many users do not connect to their colleagues while a small number of users are tightly interconnected  @xcite .",
    "holmberg and thelwall selected researchers in @xmath9 disciplines and found clear disciplinary differences in twitter usages , such as more retweets by biochemists and more sharing of links for economists  @xcite .    note that these studies first selected scientists outside of twitter and then manually searched their twitter profiles .",
    "two limitations thus exist for these studies .",
    "first , the sample size is small due to the nature of manual searching  @xcite .",
    "second , the samples are biased towards more well - known scientists .",
    "one notable exception is a study by hadgu and jschke , who presented a supervised learning based approach to identifying researchers on twitter , where the training set contains users who were related to some computer science conference handles  @xcite .",
    "although this study used a more systematic method , it still relied on the dblp , an external bibliographic dataset for computer science , and is confined in a single discipline .",
    "defining science and scientists is a herculean task and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we thus adopt a practical definition , turning to the @xmath10 standard occupational classification ( soc ) system ( http://www.bls.gov/soc/ ) released by the bureau of labor statistics , united states department of labor .",
    "we use soc because not only it is a practical and authoritative guidance for the definition of scientists but also many official statistics ( e.g. , total employment of social scientists ) are released according to this classification system .",
    "soc is a hierarchical system that classifies workers into @xmath11 major occupational groups , among which we are interested in two , namely ( 1 ) computer and mathematical occupations ( code 15 - 0000 ) and ( 2 ) life , physical , and social science occupations ( code 19 - 0000 ) . from the two groups , we compile @xmath7 scientist occupations ( supporting table  s1 ) .",
    "although authoritative , the soc does not always meet our intuitive classifications of scientists .",
    "for instance , ",
    "biologists \" is not presented in the classification .",
    "we therefore consider another source ",
    "wikipedia  to augment the set of scientist occupations . in particular , we add the occupations listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientist#by_field .",
    "we then compile a list of scientist titles from the two sources .",
    "this is done by combining titles from soc , wikipedia , and illustrative examples under each soc occupation .",
    "we also add two general titles :  scientists \" and  researchers . \" for each title , we consider its singular form and the core disciplinary term .",
    "for instance , for the title  clinical psychologists , \" we also consider  clinical psychologist , \"  psychologists , \" and  psychologist .",
    "\" we assemble a set of @xmath12 scientist titles using this method .",
    "our method of identifying scientists is inspired by a previous study that used twitter _",
    "lists _ to identify user expertise  @xcite .",
    "a twitter _ list _ is a set of twitter users that can be created by any twitter user .",
    "the creator of a list needs to provide a name and optional description .",
    "although the purpose of lists is to help users organize their subscriptions , the names and descriptions of lists can be leveraged to infer attributes of users in the lists .",
    "imagine a user creating a list called  economist \" and putting http://twitter.com/betseystevenson[@betseystevenson ] in it ; this signals that @betseystevenson may be an economist . if @betseystevenson is included in numerous lists all named  economist , \" which means that many independent twitter users classify her as an economist , it is highly likely that @betseystevenson is indeed an economist .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig : list - name - wordcloud ] where the word cloud of the names of twitter lists containing @betseystevenson is shown .",
    "we can see that ",
    "economist \" is a top word frequently appeared in the titles , signaling the occupation of this user .",
    "in other words , we",
    " crowdsource \" the identity of each twitter user .    .",
    "]    in principle , we could use twitter s ` memberships ` api ( https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/lists/memberships ) , for each user , to get all the lists containing this user , and then infer whether this user is a scientist by analyzing the names and descriptions of these lists .",
    "however , this method is highly infeasible , because ( 1 ) most users are not scientists , ( 2 ) the distribution of listed counts is right - skewed : lady  gaga , for example , is listed more than @xmath13 times ( https://www.electoralhq.com/twitter-users/most-listed ) , and ( 3 ) twitter api has rate limits .",
    "we instead employ a previously introduced list - based snowball sampling method  @xcite that starts from a given initial set of users and expands to discover more .",
    "we improve this approach by more systematically obtaining the job title lexicon and the seed user set ( supporting text ) .",
    "we use the snowball sampling ( breadth - first search ) on twitter lists .",
    "we first identify seed users ( supporting text ) and put them into a queue . for each public user in the queue , we get all the lists in which the user appears , using the twitter ` memberships ` api",
    ". then , for each public list in the subset resulting lists whose name contains at least one scientist title , we get its members using the twitter ` members ` api ( https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/lists/members ) and put those who have not been visited into the queue .",
    "the two steps are repeated until the queue is empty , which completes the sampling process .",
    "note that to remove many organizations and anonymous users as well as to speed up the sampling , we only consider users whose names contain spaces .",
    "we acknowledge that this may drop many users with non - english names or the ones who do not disclose their names in a standard way .",
    "also note that this procedure is inherently blind towards those scientists who are not listed .    from the sampling procedure ,",
    "we get @xmath14 users appearing in @xmath15 lists whose names contain scientist titles .",
    "to increase the precision of our method , the final dataset contains those users whose profile descriptions also contain scientist titles .",
    "a total number of @xmath16 users are found .",
    "table  [ tab : top - listed ] shows the top @xmath17 scientists based on number of lists whose names contain scientist titles , suggesting that our sampling method can identify scientists in diverse disciplines .",
    "these top scientists have very different levels of popularities , with the most followed scientist neil degrasse tyson attracting more than @xmath18 million followers while miles kimball has @xmath19 thousand followers .",
