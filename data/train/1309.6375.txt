    "the theoretical prediction of the black holes in general relativity arouses a great interest in studying strong gravitational physics .",
    "black hole is also generally believed to be a good test bed for both gravity and quantum mechanics . through the indirect astrophysical observation",
    ", it implies that there exist many candidates of black holes in our universe , especially in the center of galaxies .    in general , each black hole",
    "is endowed with a hawking temperature @xcite , determined by its unique nature . however , for a black hole with the same mass of the sun , its hawking temperature is of @xmath0 k , which is very difficult to directly observe using the thermodynamic method .",
    "fortunately , a black hole s existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational interactions with its surroundings .",
    "if the black hole background is stable and ignoring the impact of the small mass particle on the background , the gravitational effects can be well understood with the geodesics of the test particle .",
    "therefore , the geodesic plays a significant role in studying the gravitational effects .",
    "especially , the unstable circular null geodesic is closely related to the astronomical observation .",
    "the corresponding physics includes the quasinormal mode ( qnm ) frequencies , lensing in strong gravitational fields , and so on .",
    "the qnm frequencies @xcite were considered to be the resonances of a classical scattering problem , for example the scattering of particles in the vicinity of a black hole with the boundary conditions that only purely outgoing waves at infinity and ingoing waves at the event horizon . analytically solving the qnm frequencies through the scattering equation",
    "is not an easy work .",
    "however , in the eikonal limit , mashhoon @xcite presented an analytical method to obtain them . following this method ,",
    "the qnm frequencies were thought to be massless particles propagating along the unstable circular orbit and slowly leaking out to infinity @xcite .",
    "this was thoroughly studied by cardoso _ et .",
    "the real part of the qnms is related to the angular velocity of the unstable circular null orbit , and the imaginary part was related to the lyapunov exponent that determines the instability time scale of the orbit : @xmath1 this result was proved to be valid for not only the static , spherical spacetime , but also the equatorial orbits in the geometry of rotating black holes solution .",
    "a few years ago , the gravitational waves ( gws ) were closely linked to the qnm frequencies . in particular , lowest lying modes of qnm",
    "would give a better understanding of the properties of the gravitational wave signal .",
    "thus , one could keep in mind that the qnms dominate the gravitational wave radiating from a black hole . and",
    "the study of qnms will put forward to directly test of the gws .",
    "however , gws detection is still a grand challenge due to the lack of the strong gws source with proper frequency .",
    "on the other hand , black hole lensing is more easily observed by modern astronomical instrument , such like the very long baseline interferometry with a reachable resolution of @xmath2 . in the strong gravitational fields ,",
    "the black hole lensing is related to the unstable circular orbit ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "this , to some extent , implies that there is an elegant relation between the black hole lensing and gws .",
    "this conjecture was first made by decanini and folacci @xcite . and",
    "subsequently , the relation was found by stefanov , yazadjiev , and gyulchev @xcite for a static , spherically symmetric black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime . considering that a black hole acts simultaneously as a gravitational lens and a source of gws , then through examining the property of the black hole lensing , one could have the opportunity to obtain the characteristic frequencies of emission of gws of the observed objects .",
    "this will help us solving the difficulty that how to determine the localization of the gw sources @xcite .",
    "however , non - rotating objects are more an exception than a rule in our universe , in particular , observations show that rotating black holes most likely exist @xcite .",
    "much work shows that the dimensionless spin may adopt a larger value , or even approach its practical limitation @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to determine the nature of the black holes or explore the gws using such relation @xcite , one faces the problem that the background should be generalized to a stationary , axis - symmetric spacetime . and",
    "this is the aim of the current letter .",
    "we also apply the relation to the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole as an example , which shows an enormous help for us to determine the nature of a black hole and the detection of gws if the rotating black hole acts simultaneously as a gravitational lens and a source of gws .",
    "the low bound of the frequency of the gws can also be well determined .",
    "generally , the petrov - type d metric can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are only the functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . imposing the boundary condition",
    ", this metric can describe an asymptotically flat black hole with or without the spin parameter . in such spacetime , there are two killing fields @xmath9 related to two conserved constants along the geodesics , @xmath10 with @xmath11 the four - momentum of a test particle . @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the energy and angular momentum of the particle . in this letter , we only focus on the equatorial plane ( @xmath14 ) , the reduced metric can be expressed as @xmath15 comparing with ( [ kerr ] ) , the metric functions can be obtained .",
    "then the motion of a photon could be derived following chandrasekhar @xcite with all the coordinates and parameters adimensionalized by the black hole mass @xmath16 , @xmath17 the radial motion of a photon can be rewritten as @xmath18 where the effective potential reads @xmath19 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ kk ] ) is very similar to the classical equation of motion with a kinetic energy plus a potential energy .",
    "however , the dot here denotes the ordinary differentiation with respect to an affine parameter rather than the coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "next , it is worth to introduce an important concept , the unstable circular null geodesic , which locates at the maximum of the effective potential @xmath21 . and",
    "the following conditions are required @xmath22 with @xmath23 the radius of the unstable circular null geodesics . solving the first condition",
    ", we have the minimum angular momentum @xmath24 where all the functions take values at @xmath23 .",
    "the second condition leads to @xmath25 considering the third condition , @xmath23 is found to be the largest root of this equation . for the photon coming from infinity , approaching the nearest distant @xmath26 , and then returning back to infinity , the deflection angle can be expressed as @xmath27 in an asymptotically flat black hole background , the deflection angle increases with the decreasing of @xmath26 and gets infinity when @xmath26 approaches @xmath23 .",
    "near @xmath23 , bozza @xcite showed an approximate deflection angle , @xmath28 where the minimum impact parameter @xmath29 , and the strong deflection limit coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 are parameterized with the radius @xmath23 . for our study , we only show the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which read @xmath32 since we have adimensionalized the black hole parameters with the mass @xmath16 , @xmath29 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "according to the lens geometry presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , there would be two infinite series of images close to the black hole .",
    "assuming that the source , lens , and observer are highly aligned , there would be two observables .",
    "the first one is the minimum angular position @xmath33 of the images , and the second one is the ratio @xmath34 between the flux of the first image and the sum of the others , which is related to the relative magnitudes as @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the two observables can be constructed from @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath37 since @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the feature of the black hole lens , this relation provides an opportunity to check the consistency between theoretical model and astronomical observations .",
    "now , let us turn to the qnm frequencies . as pointed out above , in the eikonal limit , the frequencies are in the form of eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , and the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xcite @xmath40 supposing that the equatorial plane of the spacetime can be described by the metric ( [ reducemetric ] ) , and by using eqs .",
    "( [ motion ] ) and ( [ kk ] ) , the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath38 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath41 combining with the gravitational lensing , we can express @xmath38 , and @xmath39 in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath16 the newton gravitational constant , speed of light and mass of the black hole , respectively .",
    "note that here we have restored the dimension .",
    "this result implies that the angular velocity at the unstable circular null geodesics is just the inverse of the minimum impact parameter .",
    "further , using the observables from the lensing , we have @xmath46 this is our primary result .",
    "it is worth to point out that this relation is dependent of the lens geometry , i.e. , the distance @xmath47 , while it is independent of the nature of the black hole .",
    "so with predetermined @xmath47 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be accurately determined by the observables @xmath33 and @xmath48 without knowing the detail of the black hole lens .",
    "the kn black hole is the most generally vacuum solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , which can describe the spacetime geometry in the region surrounding a charged , rotating mass .",
    "the metric corresponding to it is in the form of ( [ kerr ] ) with the metric functions given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath16 are the spin , charge , and mass of the black hole .",
    "so a kn black hole can be characterized by a pair of parameters @xmath52 . adopting the method described above , these observables @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath48 could be obtained for a kn black hole lens . in order to observe a notable lensing ,",
    "the black hole lens must be a supermassive one .",
    "in general , at the center of each galaxy , there is supposed to be a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the solar mass .",
    "so the gravitational lensing by it is most easily to be observed .",
    "for example , the supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath55 at the center of our milky way is estimated to be @xmath56 , and the distance between the observer and the black hole is supposed to be @xmath57 _ kpc_. supposing that the black hole can be described by a kn metric , the minimum angular position @xmath33 for this case can be calculated as @xmath58     and @xmath48 in the @xmath59 plane .",
    "@xmath33 is described by the full lines with values from @xmath60 @xmath61arcsec from right to left .",
    "@xmath48 is described by the dashed lines with values @xmath62 from right to left .",
    "the light gray zone represents naked singularities.,width=302 ]    for each pair of parameters @xmath52 , the observables @xmath33 and @xmath48 are uniquely determined . in the reverse way , with the values of @xmath33 and @xmath48 , the black hole parameters will be determined .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the parameters of the black hole , we show in fig .",
    "[ aq ] the contour curves of constant @xmath33 ( full lines ) and @xmath48 ( dashed lines ) in the plane @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that each point in the plane is characterized by the values of both @xmath33 and @xmath48 .",
    "so with the data form astronomical observations , this provides an accurate way to determine the black hole parameters .",
    "next , we wish to determine the qnm frequencies from the observables @xmath33 and @xmath48 . with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ omega2 ] ) , we plot the contour curves of the constant @xmath33 ( full lines ) and @xmath48 ( dashed lines ) in the plane @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ omegalambda ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the figure , the contour curves of the constant @xmath33 and @xmath48 are limited in a belt denoting a black hole lens rather than a naked singularity one .",
    "the curves of the constant @xmath33 are vertical lines in the figure due to the fact that @xmath64 .",
    "each point in this belt is characterized by the values of @xmath33 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , with the data form astronomical observations , we can get the expected value of the angular velocity and lyapunov exponent of the unstable circular null geodesics .     and @xmath48 in the @xmath65 plane .",
    "@xmath33 is described by the full lines with values from @xmath60 @xmath66 from right to left .",
    "@xmath48 is described by the dashed lines with values @xmath62 from right to left.,width=302 ]",
    "the qnm frequency is a complex number , and its imaginary part will decay when the wave travels out far from the black hole .",
    "therefore for a observer located at infinity , only the real part of the qnm frequencies is meaningful , which should be related to the gws .",
    "based on this conjecture , for sgr a@xmath55 , the possible range of the gws can be read out from fig .",
    "[ omegalambda ] , which approximately is @xmath67 here @xmath68 is an integer .",
    "since the relation ( [ omega2 ] ) is independent of the nature of the black hole lens , we see that this is a universal result for the black hole located at the center of the milky way .    for @xmath69",
    ", we look forward to obtain the gws in the range of several hz . with the increase of @xmath68",
    ", one can get the gws of @xmath70 khz .",
    "if this is true , we can use the tunable resonant sensor proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to directly detect gws , which bases on the optically trapped and cooled dielectric microspheres or micro - discs , and is believed to be effective in the range of 50@xmath71300 khz . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) also gives a low bound @xmath72 ( @xmath68=1 ) for the gws @xmath73 thus , the observation of gws with @xmath74 hz from the black hole at the center of the milky way is very frustrating .",
    "this low bound of frequency of the gws can also be extended to other black hole . from the relation ( [ omega2 ] ) , we find the low bound @xmath72 depends on the distance @xmath47 and the observable @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the low bound @xmath72 . with @xmath47 varying from 6 to 18 kpc , and @xmath33 from 10 to 50 @xmath66 , @xmath72 decreases from 0.04 to 0.005 hz .",
    "thus given different values of @xmath47 and @xmath33 , we can read out the value of the low bound @xmath72 from this figure immediately .     for different values of @xmath47 and @xmath33.,width=302 ]",
    "in this letter , we have shown an elegant relation between the gws and black hole lensing with the suppose that the black hole acts simultaneously as a gws source and a gravitational lens .",
    "this relation is both effective for the black hole with or without the spin parameter in an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "it is also found to be independent of the nature of the black hole lens .",
    "thus we could obtain the information of gws emitted by the black hole through its lensing geometry and observable , which are more likely to be observed by modern astronomical instrument .",
    "the low bound @xmath72 of the frequency of the gws is given .",
    "although directly detecting gws is a challenge , the result provides a possible way to test it , or at least to locate the gws source that most like to be observed by optical or radio telescopes with proper range of the frequency .",
