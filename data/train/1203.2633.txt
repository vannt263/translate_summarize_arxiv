    "* ) , and may even provide a means of estimating stellar masses independently of binary companions @xcite .",
    "while the simplest gravity darkening models make several assumptions that restrict their applicability to very massive and supermassive stars ( as we will review in section [ sec : assumptions ] below ) , they continue to be useful in a number of different contexts .",

    "observations of rotating stars , which indeed show oblate shapes with brighter poles and darker equators , are analyzed using gravity darkening models .",
    "these models can be used to relate different stellar features to each other , for example the ratio between the polar and equatorial fluxes to the star s angular velocity .",
    "while some deviations between observations and models point to the fact that some of the assumptions made in the models may be too restrictive ( for example , the observed stars may have complicated surface layers or differential rotation ; see , e.g. , @xcite as well as section 7 of @xcite for discussions ) , the basic features are represented reasonably well .",
    "moreover , the quality of fits can be improved by introducing additional free parameters into the models ( for other model improvements see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to observations of rotating stars , resolved interferometric images of close binary stars have become available @xcite .",
    "while these observations do not yet have sufficient resolution to distinguish detailed models , they do motivate a study of gravity darkening in binaries .    in this short paper",
    "we point out that , under the assumptions listed in section [ sec : assumptions ] , the simple gravity darkening models for rotating stars can be generalized very easily to describe corotating stars in a binary system . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain very simple analytical expressions for the envelope structure , flux and the total luminosity for a massive or supermassive primary orbiting a point - mass secondary as a function of the binary separation and mass ratio .",
    "while the effects of rotation always decrease the surface flux ( compared to a nonrotating star in isolation ) , the presence of a binary companion decreases the flux in some regions of the star , but increases the flux in a region around the pole . in a binary ,",
    "we therefore encounter both gravity darkening and gravity brightening .",
    "we also identify a critical limiting separation below which hydrostatic equilibrium can not exist and at which the surface flux from the point on the stellar equator facing the binary companion vanishes . for an equal - mass binary",
    ", the total luminosity is reduced by about 13% once this separation has been reached .",
    "elements of this problem have been known for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the model we construct presumably will be superseded by more detailed numerical treatments .",
    "we nevertheless hope that our simple analysis and analytical expressions may prove useful , for instance , in providing preliminary interpretations of future resolved images of close binary stars and calibrating more detailed numerical models .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : assumptions ] we review our basic assumptions . in section [ sec : roche ] we review the roche approximation and its application to binaries to determine the envelope structure and locate the surface of corotating stars in a binary . in section [ sec : flux ]",
    "we compute the radiative flux from these stars , and find both gravity darkening and brightening .",
    "we integrate this flux to find the total luminosity in section [ sec : luminosity ] and conclude with a brief discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our analysis of a binary relies on several explicit assumptions . some of these assumptions we already adopted in paper i , where we treated uniformly rotating , highly massive stars and smss in isolation . to determine the equilibrium structure of the envelope , we assume that the primary is    1 .   governed by newtonian gravitation , 2 .   in synchronous orbit about a point - mass secondary ,    and that its envelope    1 .",

    "dominated by thermal radiation pressure , 2 .",
    "fully convective , and 3",
    ".   characterized by a constant rosseland mean opacity ( e.g. , electron scattering ) .",
    "we assume that gravitational fields are sufficiently weak so that we can apply newtonian gravity .",
    "this assumption clearly holds for normal stars .",
    "smss of greatest astrophysical interest have masses and radii that satisfy @xmath0 so that this assumption certainly holds .",
    "relativistic corrections are important for the stability of smss , but can be neglected in the analysis of the equilibrium state .",
    "the assumption that the binary is in corotation follows from the observation that most short period binaries containing massive stars orbit in circular , synchronous orbits @xcite .",
    "the combination of convection and magnetic fields are likely to generate an effective turbulent viscosity , which dampens nonsynchronous motion and brings the binary into corotation .",
    "the assumption of a point - mass companion is adopted for simplicity .",
    "if the corotating companion is also a massive star , the point - mass can be replaced by a finite star whose envelope can be treated identically to the envelope of the primary . the results for the companion s envelope structure and emergent flux would depend the same way on its mass and radius as we find for the primary .",
    "we truncate the potential of the secondary after the quadrupolar tidal term , which captures the leading - order , dominant effects of the secondary on the primary .    for large masses , the ratio between radiation pressure , @xmath1 , and gas pressure , @xmath2 , satisfies @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , eqs .",

    "for smss with @xmath4 , we can therefore neglect the pressure contributions of the plasma in determining the equilibrium profile , even though the plasma may be important for determining the stability of the star @xcite . a simple proof that very massive stars or smss are convective in this limit has been given by @xcite .",

    "this opacity is independent of density and justifies our assumption about the rosseland mean opacity .    in applications to smss",
    "our analysis neglects electron - positron pairs and klein - nishina corrections to the electron - scattering opacity , which is valid for @xmath17 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we begin with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium satisfied by the primary , @xmath18 here the right - hand side describes an effective gravitational force , which is derived from the ( interior ) gravitational potential @xmath19 of the primary , the ( exterior ) gravitational potential of the companion @xmath20 , and a centrifugal potential @xmath21 arising from the ( synchronous ) rotation of the primary .",
    "stars with soft equations of state are centrally condensed , i.e.  most of the mass is concentrated in a high - density core that is surrounded by an extended low - density envelope . for an @xmath11 polytrope , for example , the ratio between central and mean density is @xmath22 .",
    "the gravitational force in the envelope is therefore dominated by the massive core , and it is thus legitimate to neglect the self - gravity of the envelope . in the envelope , we may therefore approximate the newtonian potential of the primary star @xmath19 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the primary and @xmath25 the distance from the primary s center ( here we adopt gravitational units by setting @xmath26 ) .",
