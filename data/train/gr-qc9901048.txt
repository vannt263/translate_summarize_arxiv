    "at the beginning of the next century , we will have powerful instruments for the detection of gravitational waves , such as ligo,@xcite virgo,@xcite geo@xcite and tama.@xcite one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves in the sensitive frequency range of these laser interferometers is coalescing binary neutron stars ( bnss ) .",
    "if we have accurate theoretical templates of inspiraling phase of bnss , we can extract various information regarding them from gravitational waves , such as their mass and spin.@xcite moreover , when we construct reliable theoretical templates around the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of bnss , we can obtain physical information about the equation of state of neutron stars , i.e. , the relation between the mass and the radius of a neutron star.@xcite    binary neutron stars evolve due to the radiation reaction of gravitational waves , so that they can not reach equilibrium states . however , the timescale of the orbital decay is much longer than the orbital period of bnss until the isco .",
    "therefore , we can regard the state of a binary system as a quasi - equilibrium , even if the orbit approaches the isco .    from this point of view",
    ", several authors have attempted to obtain relativistic quasi - equilibrium configurations of bnss numerically.@xcite however , they assume that the binary system is synchronized . synchronization ( or corotation ) is not a realistic assumption for the bnss velocity field just outside the isco .",
    "this is because the viscosity of a neutron star is negligible even near the isco , and the velocity field of bnss becomes irrotational or nearly irrotational.@xcite    using the newtonian theory , ury and eriguchi have recently investigated an irrotational binary system.@xcite however , since bnss are general relativistic objects , the newtonian treatment is not sufficient and we need to include general relativistic effects . in order to investigate general relativistic effects on the orbital motion of bnss ,",
    "equilibrium sequences of bnss composed of newtonian stars with interaction forces of 2pn order have been studied.@xcite on the other hand , wilson , mathews and marronetti have computed sequences of irrotational bnss in the conformally flat approximation of general relativity.@xcite they suggest that the central densities of the stars increase when the stars decrease their separation and massive neutron stars collapse to black holes prior to merger .",
    "this conclusion is in contradicting with that of other works.@xcite therefore , it is necessary to solve the quasi - equilibrium problem in general relativity for an irrotational binary system .    in order to obtain accurate theoretical templates of gravitational waves from irrotational bnss",
    "just prior to the isco , which is our goal , a general relativistic hydrostatic problem with compressible equation of state must be numerically solved .",
    "even if we could obtain such numerical solutions , it is necessary to compare them with analytic or semi - analytic ones in order to check the validity of the numerical calculation .",
    "lombardi , rasio and shapiro have semi - analytically studied irrotational bnss using the energy variational method in the first post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation of general relativity.@xcite however , they do not solve the velocity fields of the binary system at 1pn order .",
    "they only give the velocity fields of the incompressible fluid at newtonian order which flows along a plane perpendicular to the rotational axis @xmath4 .",
    "we know that the existence of the @xmath4 component of the velocity field is important in the irrotational fluid problem.@xcite from this fact , we believe the velocity potential of 1pn order in the irrotational binary problem is important .    we have already determined the equilibrium sequence of a corotating binary system.@xcite however , the formalism which we have used in these papers is not applicable for the irrotational case . a formalism for obtaining quasi - equilibrium configuration of an irrotational binary system in general relativity",
    "has recently been constructed.@xcite in this formalism , we need to solve only two hydrostatic equations as for the fluid equations",
    ". one of them consists of the integrated forms of the euler equation and the other is the poisson equation for the velocity potential .",
    "thus , the formalism seems to be very tractable for computing the equilibrium configuration of realistic irrotational bodies .",
    "in order to develop the method for solving the irrotational binary problem consistently , the present author and collaborators recently investigated an irrotational and incompressible star of 1pn order,@xcite using above mentioned formalism . our method",
    "was originally introduced by chandrasekhar.@xcite as an extension of this method , we study an irrotational and incompressible binary system in the 1pn approximation of general relativity in this paper .",
    "we assume that each star in the binary system is constructed from an incompressible and homogeneous fluid .",
    "this assumption presents a great advantage for solving equations analytically .",
    "also , the deformation of the figure of the binary system at 1pn order is given by the lagrangian displacement vectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we formulate the method to solve the irrotational binary problem . in  3 , the lagrangian displacement vectors for description of the deformation of the binary system are given , and the angular velocity of 1pn order is derived from the first tensor virial relation .",
    "we give the boundary conditions for determining the velocity potential and the deformed figure of 1pn order in  4 .",

    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) we construct a newtonian equilibrium configuration of the binary system , i.e. , the irrotational darwin - riemann ellipsoid,@xcite as a non - perturbed state . for simplicity , we consider only the case in which the directions of the vorticity vectors and the angular velocity vector lie along @xmath4-axis , and we assume that bnss are composed of equal mass stars .",

    "\\(3 ) we calculate the deformation from the newtonian binary system induced by 1pn gravity using the lagrangian displacement vectors introduced by chandrasekhar.@xcite then , the corrections for the newtonian quantities due to the deformation of the binary system are estimated .",

    "we calculate the newtonian and 1pn terms which we need in the above procedures .",
    "we consider the equilibrium sequences of bnss of equal masses ( @xmath14 ) whose coordinate separation is @xmath15 .",
    "for calculational simplicity , we use four kinds of coordinate systems which are all rotating frames .",
    "the first frame is @xmath16 , in which the center of mass of a star ( star 1 ) is located at the origin of the coordinate system , and the other one ( star 2 ) is located at @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "the second one is @xmath18 , in which the center of mass of star 2 is located at the origin , and star 1 is located at @xmath19 .",
    "the third one is @xmath20 , in which the origin is located at the center of mass of the binary system , and the centers of masses of two stars are located at @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the fourth one is @xmath23 .",
    "this frame is just the same rotating frame as @xmath20 , but we label it with a different name for convenience .",
    "we use @xmath20 for star 1 and @xmath23 for star 2 .",
    "then , the relations among the four corotating frames are ( x_1 ,  x_2 ,  x_3 ) & = & ( x_1 + r 2 ,  x_2 ,  x_3 ) , + ( y_1 ,  y_2 ,  y_3 ) & = & ( y_1 -r 2 ,  y_2 ,  y_3 ) . due to the symmetry , we consider only the equilibrium configuration of star 1 in the following .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the 1pn corrections for the angular velocity , the velocity potential , the energy , and the angular momentum in the darwin - riemann problem . in the calculation , we assume that the parameter @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a typical radius of a star , is small and we use it as the expansion parameter . accordingly , there exist two different types of expansion parameters in this paper",
    ". one of them is the post - newtonian parameter and the other is @xmath24 .    at newtonian order , the angular velocity ( @xmath26 ) becomes@xcite ( see  [ secangvelo ] for derivation )",
    "_dr^2 = 2 m r^3 + 18_11 r^5 + o(r^-7 ) .",
    "[ nomega ] thus , in the 1pn approximation , we can expect that the following types of quantities will be the main terms at 1pn order : ~m r^3 ,   ~m r^3 ,   ~m a_0 ^ 2 r^5 ,  and   ~m a_0 ^ 2 r^5 .",
    "here we have used the relation @xmath27 .",
    "we will derive the four types of terms given above .",
    "since we consider an incompressible fluid , the gravitational potentials inside each star are expressed as polynomials in the coordinates @xmath16 .",

    "the deviation between the location of the minimums of the energy and angular momentum comes from the fact that we assume @xmath168 is a small parameter and expand the energy up to @xmath169 and the angular momentum up to @xmath170 . in any case , we may expect that the isco is located near the two minimums .",
    "it is found that even if we increase the compactness parameter @xmath163 , the angular velocity at the isco in units of @xmath3 has almost the same value as in the newtonian case , while the orbital separation decreases .",

    "we regard such an instability point as the bifurcation point to a new sequence .",

    "3 , the total energy and total angular momentum in the ellipsoidal approximation are shown as functions of the normalized separation of the binary system and the normalized orbital angular velocity .",
    "it is found that the quantitative features of the energy and angular momentum are the same as in fig .",
    ", we find that values at 1pn order ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) differ by only a few percent outside the isco from those of the full calculation , even if the figure is assumed to be an ellipsoid .",
    "this implies that the ellipsoidal approximation gives good approximate results .",
    "however , neglect of the velocity potential of 1pn order has an effect on the quantitative nature of the energy and angular momentum .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "4 that the angular velocity at the minimum point of the energy and angular momentum increases when we increase the compactness parameter .",
    "figure 4 is obtained by setting the velocity potential at 1pn order to zero and solving only eqs .",

    "although the 1pn approximation is not valid , we take @xmath163 up to @xmath176 , which we regard as the realistic compactness parameter of a neutron star , in order to compare our results with those of lombardi , rasio and shapiro@xcite ( see fig . 4 in their paper ) . in fig . 5 , the thick and thin solid lines denote the cases of the full calculation and the absence of the 1pn velocity potential .",

    "the dotted and dashed lines denote the `` compressible '' cases , whose polytropic indices are @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "we plot these lines by assuming that the 1pn correction to the angular velocity is the same value as in the incompressible case if the stars in the binary system composed of compressible fluid have a polytropic index less than @xmath179 , i.e. , the hard equation of state .",
    "also , we adopt the angular velocity at the isco given by ury and eriguchi@xcite as that of the irrotational and compressible binary system in the newtonian theory .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "5 that the angular velocity at the isco is overestimated when we neglect the 1pn velocity potential .",
    "figure 5 agrees qualitatively with that of lombardi , rasio and shapiro.@xcite however , our results suggest that the angular velocities given by lombardi , rasio and shapiro are overestimated because of the absence of the 1pn velocity potential in their calculation .",
    "the reason that the total force of the system balances with the smaller orbital angular velocity than that in the case of the absence of the 1pn velocity potential is as follows .",
    "we regard the energy minimum point as the isco in this paper . as the stars in the binary system become closer and closer to each other , the energy terms with a minus sign , such as the binding energy term , decrease and those with a plus sign , such as the rotation energy term , increase . at the isco , the increase of the energy terms with a plus sign is equal to the decrease of those with a minus sign .",
    "when the star possesses internal motion , such motion can produce a part of the energy with a plus sign .",
    "therefore , if the star with the 1pn velocity potential has the same ellipsoidal figure as that without the 1pn velocity potential , the energy of the orbital motion , that is to say , the orbital angular velocity , can decrease .    finally , we summarize the results in tables i  vi . in table i , the angular velocity , energy and angular momentum of the newtonian and 1pn orders are shown along the sequence of the binary system . in this table ,",

    ", we give the coefficients of the velocity potential and deformation associated with the star itself , and in table iv those associated with the binary motion are represented . also , we show the results of the ellipsoidal approximation in tables v and vi .",

    "using the scheme developed in a previous paper,@xcite we have investigated the equilibrium sequences of irrotational and incompressible binary systems in the 1pn approximation .",
    "our results presented in the previous section should be useful to check the numerical code for solving the irrotational binary problem .",
    "the conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) due to the 1pn effect , the orbital separation at the isco decreases in proportion to the compactness parameter @xmath0 .",
    "\\(2 ) the orbital angular velocity at the isco in units of @xmath3 has almost the same value as in the newtonian case , even if we increase the compactness parameter .",
    "\\(3 ) the ellipsoidal approximation gives fairly accurate results throughout the equilibrium sequence .",
    "\\(4 ) it is important to include the velocity potential at 1pn order .",
    "finally , we discuss the velocity potential at 1pn order .",
    "as stated in a previous paper,@xcite the internal velocity has an @xmath4 component .",
    "therefore , we suggest that when we solve an irrotational binary problem numerically , we must include the @xmath4 component of the internal velocity .    next , we discuss the effect of the deformation at newtonian order . even in the incompressible case ,",
    "stars in the binary system deform from ellipsoidal figures at newtonian order.@xcite we can estimate the contribution from the octupole moment on the angular velocity .",
    "first , we assume that the deformation from an ellipsoidal figure is a small perturbation .",
    "accordingly , the deformation is expressed by the lagrangian displacement vectors ( [ lagdisp7 ] ) and ( [ lagdisp8 ] ) for the octupole moment . here",
    "we neglect the contribution of the hexadecapole and other moments as higher order terms .",
    "then , the angular velocity is written ^2 & = & 2 m r^3 + 18_11 r^5 -2 mr ( i_1)_n + & & -4 r^6 + & & + 1 c^2 ^2 + o(r^-7 ) , [ higherangvelo ] where the subscript n denotes the perturbation of newtonian order . equation ( [ higherangvelo ] ) is approximated as ^2 & = & 2 m r^3 , where @xmath181 and @xmath182 denote the amplitude of the lagrangian displacement vectors ( [ lagdisp7 ] ) and ( [ lagdisp8 ] ) , and _ 1 & = & 1 5 + & & + 6 35 ^ 3 ( 3 -1 2 _ 2 ^ 2 + 3 2 _ 3 ^ 2 ) , + _ 2 & = & -12 35 ^3 ( _ 2 ^ 2 -_3 ^ 2 ) . from table",
    "ii , we can obtain the values in the range of @xmath183 as & & _ 1 _ 21 ~0.14 _ 21 , + & & _ 2 _ 22 ~0.001 _ 22 , + & & 0.0243 c_s ^3 2_2 _ 3 ^2 0.121 .",
    "if the amplitude @xmath181 ( and @xmath182 ) is much less than 1 , i.e. , in the range of @xmath184 , the contribution of the octupole deformation to the angular velocity is smaller than that of the 1pn correction . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath181 and/or @xmath182 have values near or greater than 1 , the above perturbative treatments break down . in this case",
    ", we can not estimate the contribution of the octupole moment until we construct the equilibrium figure including the octupole moment .",
    "moreover , we would like to mention the importance of the velocity potential of 1pn order .",
    "if we neglect it , we obtain different features for the isco .",
    "accordingly , we must take into account the velocity potential at 1pn order even when we use the ellipsoidal approximation .    from fig . 5",
