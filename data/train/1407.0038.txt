    "as presented in two letters  @xcite , the peccei - quinn symmetry limit of singlet extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) encompasses rich higgs and dark matter ( dm ) physics , whose phenomenology and collider signatures we began exploring in  @xcite .",
    "the singlet extensions , like the next - to - mssm ( nmssm )  @xcite , nearly - mssm ( nmssm )  @xcite , and @xmath2ssm  @xcite , are traditionally motivated as possible solutions to the notorious @xmath3 problem in the mssm and give rise to some limited scenarios for exotic higgs decays and dm phenomenology .",
    "it was remarked , however , that these scenarios share a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry limit ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , giving rise to novel higgs and dm signatures outside the scope of previous studies .",
    "most notably , the pq symmetry limit provides a supersymmetric framework for studying sub - electroweak ( sub - ew ) scale dm  @xcite .",
    "possibilities for sub - ew scale dm in typical mssm contexts were stymied by lep constraints and acceptable relic density requirements  @xcite .",
    "having a sub - ew dm particle , however , neatly dovetails with exciting opportunities in higgs physics , as the 125 gev higgs discovered by cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite has new exotic decay channels available .",
    "this connection between dm physics and exotic higgs decays in the pq symmetry limit scenario was explicitly explored in ref .",
    "@xcite for two benchmark models that gave rise to two distinct exotic higgs signatures of @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the 125 gev higgs decay . in this work",
    ", we will continue exploring this connection between dm physics and higgs collider phenomenology with two new benchmarks .",
    "the first , which will give the exotic higgs decay channel @xmath6 , will help complete the set of possible observable or theoretically well - motivated decay modes for the 125 higgs boson .",
    "the second will be a new benchmark corresponding to the @xmath7 exotic decay , which instead of being optimized for discovery at the lhc , would instead be motivated as a possible model explaining the galatic center gamma ray excess  @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : introduction ] , the pq symmetry limit of singlet extensions of the mssm provides a supersymmetric context for studies of sub - ew scale dm and the corresponding exotic higgs decays . in the pq symmetry limit ,",
    "the superpotential and soft supersymmetry - breaking terms are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the neutral higgs fields of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 supermultiplets , respectively .",
    "we will temporarily ignore any possible explicit breaking of the pq symmetry in eq .",
    "[ eqn : pqlimit ] , _",
    "e.g. _ an nmssm superpotential term @xmath19 , but we remark that such small terms are typically required in more realistic scenarios . in addition , we will further narrow our focus to the decoupling limit given by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , which will simplify our analytic analysis as well as help avoid a landau pole problem .",
    "we will also assume that there is no explicit @xmath10-violation in the higgs sector , since the current experimental data constrains large mixing between the @xmath10-even and @xmath10-odd higgs states  @xcite .",
    "in this scenario , there are three important characteristics distinguishing it from typical mssm or nmssm - like scenarios , and we will discuss each in turn .      first , because of the pq - symmetry and supersymmetry ( susy ) , there simultaneously co - exist three particles of sub - ew scale : the gauge singlet - like @xmath10-even and @xmath10-odd higgs bosons , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the singlino - like neutralino , @xmath24 , with their masses much lighter than the scale of the pq symmetry breaking and their phenomenology approximately model independent . these particles or mass eigenstates",
    "are strictly reduced to the pq axion supermultiplet ( saxion ( @xmath25 ) , axion(@xmath26 ) , and axino ( @xmath27 ) ) in the susy limit .",
    "the goldstone ( or pq axion ) supermultiplet is represented by @xmath28 after the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken , where @xmath29 in which @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath17 , @xmath35 are the superfields charged under the pq symmetry with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev .",
    "here @xmath39 is the @xmath40 breaking scale and @xmath41 is an effective @xmath42 charge of @xmath43 . in our model , @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath43 is not charged under any other continuous symmetries , then @xmath41 is simply its @xmath42 charge  @xcite .",
    "the axion ( @xmath26 ) mass is protected by the goldstone theorem , and it is related to the saxion ( @xmath25 ) and axino ( @xmath47 ) masses by susy .",
    "if the @xmath42 symmetry is global and susy is unbroken , then we have @xmath48 .",
    "if susy is broken ( this is often true when @xmath49 ) , the saxion and axino become massive while the axion remains massless .",
    "there are two sources which may contribute to the mass splitting between the superfield components .",
    "the first arise as diagonal corrections in superspace .",
    "the second is the separate real scalar and fermion mixing with other massive particles . in the latter case ,",
    "the mass eigenstates become misaligned with the original saxion and axino states . for @xmath50 , @xmath51 is of tev scale or above , since an ew scale @xmath3 is required by electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "this immediately leads to @xmath52 .",
    "the pq symmetry breaking is then mainly controlled by the singlet superfield @xmath18 , and @xmath53 is hence @xmath18-like .",
    "the diagonal axino mass at tree level is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56-component of the @xmath57 chiral supermultiplet which is charged under the @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "note @xmath58 falls to zero when none of the pq - charged @xmath56-terms obtain a vacuum expectation value  @xcite .",
    "given @xmath59 we have @xmath60 since @xmath61 , the axino is mostly singlino in our case .",
    "the contribution to the axino mass from mixing with the gauginos is further suppressed by the product of @xmath62 and a gauge coupling factor .",
    "an axino as light as @xmath63 gev or even lighter is therefore quite natural in this context .",
    "we denote the axino and other neutralinos as @xmath64 , with @xmath24 ( mostly singlino ) being the lightest .",
    "the largest non - singlino content of @xmath24 is higgsino , which is of the order @xmath65 and hence can be very small in our case .",
    "one important constraint on this scenario is the contribution of @xmath66 to the @xmath67 invisible decay width . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath68 coupling is suppressed by @xmath69 , which is small in the decoupling limit since @xmath50 and @xmath70  @xcite . at the same time , @xmath71 , if kinematically allowed , is only suppressed by @xmath65 and can be more constraining .",
    "next we consider the saxion mass , which has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "we briefly summarize the main conclusions here . at tree level , in the large @xmath72 limit",
    ", the minimum of the scalar potential in our scenario satisfies @xmath73 for later convenience , we introduce two parameters @xmath74 which characterize the deviation from the exact relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tree_relation ] ) .",
    "after ewsb , the saxion mixes with two @xmath10 even higgses .",
    "we denote the lightest scalar as @xmath22 . at tree level",
    ", we have ( m_h_1 ^ 2)_tree & = & - 4 v^2 ^2 + 16 ^4 + & + & ( 1- ) ( 1 + ) + & + & _ i ( )  .",
    "we see that in the decoupling limit , @xmath75 , @xmath76 can be much smaller than the ew scale without too much fine tuning . at the same time , to avoid a tachyonic mass for @xmath22 , there is an upper limit ^2 <  . based on these discussions",
    ", we would expect a natural co - existence of three light singlet or singlino - like particles , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , in the pq symmetry plus decoupling limit of singlet extensions of the mssm .",
    "we also expect some small explicit pq symmetry breaking which would generate a small mass for the axion , @xmath23 .",
    "this feature is clearly shown in the nmssm context in  @xcite , while the lightness of @xmath24 in the pq limit of the other mssm - extensions was also noticed in refs .",
    "the light singlino - like @xmath24 provides a natural supersymmetric sub - ew scale dm candidate .",
    "in particular , the existence of light @xmath23 and @xmath22 states allow @xmath24 to achieve simultaneously the correct relic density and a spin - independent direct detection cross section varying over several orders , which is the focus of subsec .",
    "[ subsec : singlino ] .",
    "we remark that this feature is absent in the @xmath77-symmetry limit of the nmssm , where the coupling of the cubic term in superpotential @xmath78 is large , leading to large contributions to the masses of both @xmath76 and @xmath79 at tree level",
    ".      second , if we assume @xmath77-parity conservation , @xmath24 can be a good dm candidate at the sub - ew scale , in contrast with usual mssm constructions .",
    "the direct detection cross section for @xmath24 varies within a large range and arises dominantly via the exchange of a light scalar with nucleons .",
    "moreover , the relic density is driven by pair annihilation of singlino - like neutralinos probing the light pseudoscalar resonance  @xcite and can match current measurements .",
    "while the correct dm relic density can also be achieved via an @xmath25-channel exchange of the singlet - like cp - even higgs boson , this process has no @xmath25-wave contribution and suffers a @xmath80-wave suppression : realistic scenarios typically require more fine - tuning , and the variability of the direct detection cross section is much more constrained for a given @xmath79 .    in the past decade ,",
    "motivated by a series of interesting direct detection experimental results ( see  @xcite ) , many studies of sub - ew scale dm have been performed in various contexts ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it was found , however , that a strict mssm context for sub - ew scale dm is not easy to achieve . of the mssm neutralinos",
    ", a wino - like or higgsino - like dm candidate would have an associated chargino at about the same mass and be ruled out from searches at lep .",
    "a bino - like dm candidate may be feasible , but it potentially requires the existence of extra light particles , such as sfermions , to mediate annihilation or coannihilation for reducing the dm relic density to an acceptable level , which has been generally excluded by susy searches at lep and the lhc .",
    "these factors make sub - ew scale dm highly constrained in the mssm ( for more discussions , e.g. , see  @xcite ) . in the singlet extensions of the mssm , however , a light singlino - like neutralino , which generally arises in the nearly pq - symmetry limit ,",
    "is relatively unconstrained , and so the pq - limit provides a supersymmetric benchmark to explore sub - ew scale dm phenomenology  @xcite ( for some of the subsequent studies on dm physics in or related to this scenario , see  @xcite ) .",
    "sub - ew scale dm is now being revisited in the context of the gc gamma ray excess  @xcite interpreted as an indirect detection of dm  @xcite .",
    "this gamma ray excess was identified from data collected by the fermi gamma ray space telescope , and studies indicate the excess extends at least @xmath81 from the gc , lessening the possibility of astrophysical fakes .",
    "fits to the spectrum favor a roughly 30 gev dark matter particle annihilating to @xmath82 , with an annihilation cross section corresponding to that of a thermal relic , @xmath83 @xmath84/s  @xcite . again , this hint of sub - ew scale dm can not be accommodated in the mssm , but we will show a suitable benchmark in the pq limit of singlet extensions of the mssm .    in particular , the natural annihilation channel for 30 gev singlinos in the pq symmetry limit is via @xmath85 . for @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 gev , the @xmath23 pseudoscalar preferentially decays to the heaviest kinematically open pair of sm fermions , namely @xmath82 . for the gc gamma ray excess",
    ", this will serve to avoid diluting the gamma ray spectrum shape .",
    "the light @xmath23 and @xmath22 states are critical for helping @xmath24 achieve the appropriate relic density as well as determining the direct detection possibilities . unlike an @xmath25-wave dominant annihilation process ,",
    "the thermally averaged annihilation cross section @xmath88 is sensitive to the temperature for processes mediated by the breit - wigner enhancement effect , _",
    "e.g. _ , the one under consideration ( for general discussions on the breit - wigner mechanism in dm physics , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is simply because the chance for the annihilated dm particles to sit on or close to the mediator resonance is temperature - dependent .",
    "for example , if @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath90 , as the temperature decreases , the annihilated dm particles get less active and hence have a better chance to sit close to the mediator resonance or have a larger @xmath88 . explaining the gc gamma - rays requires @xmath91 .",
    "this means that @xmath92 is smaller than this value in the early universe and the dm particles therefore are generically over - produced .",
    "so we will consider the case @xmath93 only .",
    "different from the first case , @xmath94 tends to have a larger value in the early universe in this case ( _ e.g. _ , see  @xcite ) , leading to @xmath95 to generate the observed dm relic density , therefore , new inputs like non - thermal production mechanisms are needed .",
    "this can be achieved by decaying thermally produced next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) ( with its density before the decay denoted by @xmath96 ) , such as slepton , sneutrino or neutralino , with the dm relic density given by @xmath97 we will leave the detailed discussions of such mechanisms for future work .",
    "the third main feature of the pq symmetry limit is the set of new exotic decays for the sm - like higgs boson , which can be potentially probed at colliders soon or in the future .",
    "we first note that in the pq symmetry limit , unlike the @xmath77-symmetry limit , the exotic decay channels of the sm - like higgs into a pair of light singlet - like @xmath10-even or @xmath10-odd higgs bosons are generically suppressed .",
    "the suppressed tree - level couplings of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be directly calculated from the higgs potential , given by  @xcite @xmath101 in the exact pq limit .",
    "here we have used the mixing parameters given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eigenstate ] ) in appendix  [ app : gauge ] .",
    "alternately , the coupling @xmath11 can be calculated using the properties of the goldstone boson , which we detail in appendix  [ app : goldstone ] .",
    "we see that both br@xmath102 and br@xmath103 are suppressed by @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , these decay channels are rather inconsequential for the sm - like higgs search in our scenario .",
    "this is different from the well - known physics in the @xmath77-symmetry limit of the nmssm  @xcite , where @xmath23 is light , playing a role of pseudo - goldstone boson in breaking the approximate @xmath77-symmetry .",
    "there , the decay of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath105 is typically significant .",

    "the bino - like neutralino subsequently decays via the following main ways  @xcite :    * @xmath113 , which is favored most by kinematics in general context , due to the lightness of @xmath114 . *",
    "@xmath115 , though this chain is strongly constrained by the availability of the phase space .",
    "* @xmath116 , whose branching ratio can be as large as @xmath117 in the case where the mass splitting between @xmath24 and @xmath107 is small , say , @xmath118  @xcite .    the complete decay chain which is favored most by kinematics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_topo ] .",
    "in addition , though it is not the focus of this article , if @xmath119 , @xmath120 can be significant .",
    "so , the decay topologies of @xmath98 in this scenario are very rich . as a matter of fact , for the seven possible topologies listed in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , all of them can be achieved in this scenario except that the one @xmath121 is generically suppressed .",
    "the richness of the @xmath98 decay topologies necessarily leads to variety of its kinematics at colliders .",
    "however , all of these decay chains eventually give a final state with at least one singlino - like @xmath24 , the collider signatures therefore are generically semivisible ( here we will not consider the possibility @xmath122 ) or characterized by missing transverse energy ( met ) and some visible objects , with or without a resonance .",
    "for example , we have @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the visible objects can be either collimated , via the decays of the light resonance @xmath125 , or isolated , via the decays of the @xmath67 boson .",
    "the discussion can be generalized to @xmath126 though its final state is more complicated and the decay products tend to be softer .",

    "the eigenstates of the three @xmath10-even higgs are given by @xmath213 for our purposes , the eigenvalue and eigenstate of the lightest @xmath10-even higgs boson are calculated to an order above the other two .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the coupling @xmath11 using the properties of the goldstone boson . in the polar coordinates of the higgs fields , @xmath11 arises from the kinetic term of @xmath23 .",
    "we will take the kinetic term of @xmath13 as an illustration .",
    "we write @xmath13 as @xmath214 the relevant term in the @xmath13 kinetic term expansion is @xmath215 because @xmath23 is massless , we have @xmath216 .",
    "so the contribution of the @xmath13 kinetic term to the @xmath217 is @xmath218 with all higgs kinetic terms incorporated , we have @xmath219 with @xmath220 defined in eqs .

    "unlike the axino , the saxion may obtain sizable mass corrections in its diagonal mass term or via its mixing with other massive particles , with susy softly broken .",
    "the diagonal saxion mass at tree level is given by @xmath222 with @xmath223 being the squared mass matrix .",
    "then we see @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the soft trilinear scalar coupling of eq .  (",

    "the corrections from mixing , however , can be of the same order . with the mixing corrections included , the tree - level saxion mass is given by @xmath226 at tree level , the first term is negative , while the second term is smaller than the first by a factor @xmath227 .",

    "it is easy to calculate the determinant of the mass squared matrix of the @xmath10-even higgs bosons , which is given by @xmath232 to avoid a tachyonic vacuum at tree - level , the determinant must be positive , which immediately leads to the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stability ] ) if @xmath233 .",
    "we now address the question of why the saxion mass does not get a large mass correction from the soft susy breaking mass term of the singlet field , even though the saxion is singlet - like .",
    "recall the vacuum stability conditions are twofold .",
    "first , the higgs potential must be locally flat at the vacuum point , so its first - order partial derivative with respect to the field variables must be zero .",
    "second , the physical masses of the scalar particles can not be negative , which implies that the second - order partial derivative with respect to the mass eigenstates must be positive .",
    "the latter has been discussed above via the determinant argument .",
    "to see what the former implies , we start by expressing the scalars as @xmath234 we can derive the locally - flat conditions for the @xmath10-even higgs components  -violation . in this case , the locally - flat conditions with respect to @xmath10-odd higgs components are satisfied automatically .",
    "] and re - express the soft susy - breaking higgs masses in terms of @xmath235 , @xmath225 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath51 . at tree level , they are given by @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 as usual .",
    "for @xmath241 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn:104 ] ) can be expanded as @xmath242 so , @xmath243 needs to be much smaller than the squared ew scale to get a stable vacuum .",
    "thus , in the pq symmetry limit , the vacuum stability forbids the saxion to obtain a large mass correction from softly susy breaking effects .",
