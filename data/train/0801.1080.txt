    "since the discovery of free - floating intracluster planetary nebulae ( icpns ) in the virgo cluster @xcite , extensive imaging and spectroscopic observations were carried out to determine their projected phase space distribution and the fraction of diffuse cluster light not bound to virgo galaxies . to enlarge the sample of more than 40 icpn line - of - sight ( los ) velocities available from @xcite , we have obtained new pn spectra with flames at the eso vlt @xcite .",
    "the high spectral resolution of the new data allows us for the first time to measure expansion velocities for the [ oiii ] nebula shells of 11 pns in the virgo cluster core , nearly half way between m87 and m86 .",
    "the expansion velocity of a planetary nebula ( pn ) is one of the most important parameters determining its evolution , but currently it is known only for a few hundred galactic pns , mostly bright objects in the milky way disk @xcite , and for a few tens in the magellanic clouds and m31 .",
    "when interpreted using dynamically evolving nebular models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pn shell expansion velocities provide reliable extimates of pn dynamical ages and distance estimates for galactic pns .    in this letter , we give a brief summary of our observations in section  [ obser ] . in section  [ pnexp ]",
    ", we present the pn [ oiii ] 5007   half - width half maximum velocity measurements @xmath5 , and @xmath6 magnitudes as defined by @xcite . in section  [ m87pnlf ]",
    "we build the pn luminosity function ( pnlf ) for the spectroscopically confirmed pn sample in virgo and for the subsample bound to the m87 halo . in section  [ outerradius ] , we then estimate the outer radii of the m87 halo pns from the observed pn expansion velocities and their visibility lifetimes .",
    "we finally discuss in section  [ fdiscuss ] the remaining distance uncertainties , the shape of the pnlf in the m87 halo , and the mechanisms that may be responsible for the large core masses of the brightest pns in the halo of m87 .",
    "data were acquired in service mode ( 22 hrs , 076.b-0086 pi : m. arnaboldi ) , with the flames spectrograph at ut2 on vlt in the giraffe+medusa configuration .",
    "we used the high - resolution grism hr 504.8 , covering a wavelength range of 250  centered on 5036  and a spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the redshifted [ oiii ] emissions of pns in the virgo cluster core fall near the center of the grism transmission . with this setup ,",
    "the instrumental broadening of the arc lines is fwhm = 0.29   or 17 kms@xmath1 , and the error on the wavelength measurements is 0.0025   or 150 ms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a total of three flames plate configurations were produced for the virgo core fields f4 and f7 surveyed by @xcite .",
    "the exposure times were based on the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) estimate for detecting the [ oiii ] 5007   line flux of @xmath8ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath10 , with s / n @xmath11 5 . the data reduction was carried out with the giraffe pipeline , for the ccd prereduction , fiber identification , wavelength calibration , geometric distortion corrections , co - addition , and extraction of the final one - dimensional spectra .",
    "data analysis and the velocity measurements are presented in doherty et al .",
    "a total of 12 pns were confirmed spectroscopically . in the extracted pn spectra , the [ oiii ]",
    "5007 emissions of 11 pns have measured fwhm between @xmath12 and @xmath13  ; the comparison with the arclines fwhm ( @xmath14  ) indicates that these [ oiii ] emission lines are resolved .",
    "monte carlo simulations give an error on the line width measurements of @xmath15  for a s / n per pixel of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic expansion velocity measured from the [ oiii ] 5007line profile appears to be representative for the material velocities associated with the pn bright rim , and is systematically lower than the expansion speed of the pn shell s outer radius , according to 1d hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "the shell expansion velocities are associated with fainter structures at larger radii , which have been measured only for galactic pns @xcite .    from the flames",
    "pn spectra , we are able to measure the spectroscopic expansion velocities from the resolved [ oiii ] 5007  emissions for 11 pns in the @xcite sample ; high s / n spectra for 4 pns are shown in fig .",
    "we use the `` half - width at half maximum '' of the [ oiii ] 5007   line , corrected for the instrumental half width , @xmath5 , as measurement of the spectroscopic expansion velocity for the pn bright rim . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "these @xmath5 measurements must be multiplied by a factor of about two to get an estimate of the pn s true expansion velocity .",
    "when it is possible , we also measure the spectroscopic expansion velocities for [ oiii ] 4959  . when double peaks or secondary peaks are present in the resolved line profiles , their counts are consistent with the noise .",
    "the average [ oiii ] spectroscopic expansion velocity for this pn sample is @xmath17 kms@xmath1 , with an rms dispersion of 2.6 kms@xmath1 .",
    "both values are significantly smaller than those determined for samples of pns observed in the galactic bulge @xcite",
    ". the virgo pns might represent the [ oiii ] brightest part of the galactic bulge population , or they might come from an entirely different population ; this issue requires further work .    based on los velocities",
    ", we divide the current dataset in two subsamples : 5 pns are associated with the halo of m87 , i.e. belong to a narrow velocity peak in the los velocity distribution ( losvd ) centered at the m87 systemic velocity , with @xmath18 kms@xmath1 @xcite , and 6 are `` free - flying '' cluster pns , with @xmath19 kms@xmath1 velocity differences .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath5 measurements for the two subsamples are similar within the limited statistics , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; the ks - test gives only a 55% probability that the two subsamples are different .",
    "the @xmath5 vs. m(5007 ) plot in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the pns within 0.7 mags of the bright cut - off have @xmath20 kms@xmath1 .",
    "this is in agreement with the predictions of the spatially integrated line profile @xmath21 vs. @xmath6 computed with the nebular 1d hydrodynamics code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and in prep . ) for central star masses in the range @xmath22  m@xmath3 .",
    "when a pn s distance is known , its expansion velocity and size can be used to determine its dynamical age .",
    "this age , in turn , can be combined with information about the central star s effective temperature to yield an estimate of the core mass @xcite . in our case",
    "we can not measure the outer radii for the virgo pns , as they are unresolved at a distance of 15 mpc .",
    "our approach is then the reverse : we shall estimate the central star masses from the [ oiii ] 5007   fluxes , derive the pn lifetimes @xmath23 from central star evolutionary tracks and nebular 1-d hydrodynamical models , and infer their physical dimensions as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( schoenberner et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "the pnlf for the spectroscopically confirmed pns in the virgo core region around m87 is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the brightest pns have @xmath6 in the range @xmath26 .",
    "pns with similar magnitudes were also detected by @xcite in the outer regions of m87 . based on a sample of 338 pns",
    ", @xcite determined a brightening of the pnlf cutoff of 0.37 mag for the pn subsample at @xmath27 with respect to the sample inside @xmath28 .",
    "they interpreted the brightening of the pnlf in the m87 outer halo as due to a population of virgo icpns filling the elongated volume of the virgo cluster ( up to 4 mpc along the los ) .",
    "the number of foreground pns would be roughly proportional to the area of the field , and therefore be largest in the outer regions of the surveyed field .    in our spectroscopic pn sample we can bypass the distance ambiguity by selecting the subsample of 14 pns bound to m87 .",
    "these pns are associated with a narrow peak in the losvd centred at the systemic velocity of m87 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . their average velocity @xmath29 kms@xmath1 and the @xmath30 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the empirical pnlf for the m87 halo pns is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : their @xmath6 magnitudes are in the range @xmath31 , indicating a slightly brighter cut - off than for the pn population in the central @xmath28 region of m87 .",
    "however we can now say that this is an intrinsic property of the pn halo population , as we now know that these 14 pns are all at the distance of m87 within @xmath32 kpc ( see also  6 ) .",
    "from the measured @xmath6 of the m87 halo pns , we estimate the central star total luminosity .",
    "both models and observations indicate that no more than 10% of the central star s total luminosity comes out in this line @xcite .",
    "therefore the intrinsic luminosity of the post - agb star that powers an @xmath33 pn at 14.5 mpc must be @xmath34 l@xmath3 and , based on the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , we thus obtain a central core mass larger than @xmath35m@xmath3 . using a 1-d hydrodynamics code and the stellar evolution tracks of @xcite , @xcite computed the nebular physical parameters and evolution of @xmath6 as function of nebular age , from near the agb phase to the white dwarf cooling tracks .",
    "the nebular tracks of ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) that reach the brighest 0.5 mag of the pnlf , and have a central core mass of @xmath36m@xmath3 as the virgo pns , have very short visibility lifetimes , @xmath37 yrs . from our measurements and @xmath25 , we can then determine the outer radii @xmath38 of the brightest pns in the m87 halo to be @xmath39 pc .",
    "the nebular shells of these pns are compact and similar to those observed for the brightest ( @xmath40 ) galactic bulge pns .",
    "_ distance uncertainties and pnlf brightening - _ we briefly consider the question whether the bright pne in the velocity range bound to m87 could be foreground objects . the mean heliocentric velocity of the virgo cluster is @xmath41 kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "m87 is redshifted by about 300 kms@xmath1 ( @xmath42 kms@xmath1 ) with respect to the virgo cluster mean velocity , and is falling into virgo from in front @xcite towards m86 @xcite .",
    "pns at the cutoff @xmath43 with apparent magnitudes 26.2 - 26.0 would be between @xmath44 mpc in front of m87 .",
    "diffuse light stars at these locations would be in the infall region towards virgo where the infall velocities are of order 1000 kms@xmath1 and vary rapidly with distance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . on the other hand , radial velocities of @xmath45 kms@xmath1",
    "would be expected for foreground objects @xmath46 mpc in front of the virgo core .",
    "it is thus very unlikely that a distribution of foreground pne should be observed in our fields at exactly the systemic velocity of m87 , with a dispersion of only @xmath32 kms@xmath1 , and less likely still that this population should be projected onto the m87 halo inside 150 kpc but not be observed in the adjacent virgo core region covered by our data .",
    "while the virgo cluster has a significant depth ( @xmath47mpc ) , it is unlikely that the diffuse light and icpn distribution are similarly elongated .",
    "the search for icpns outside the virgo cluster core has given negative results ( castro et al .",
    "2008 , in prep . ) , and the deep photometry of @xcite shows that the diffuse light is mostly associated with the giant elliptical galaxies , m87 , m86 and m84 , whereas its surface brightness decreases sharply at larger radii .",
    "observations of the diffuse light in @xmath48 galaxy clusters also show that it is more centrally concentrated than the cluster galaxies @xcite , in agreement with cosmological simulation of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that the selected m87 halo pns are bound to m87 , and that their bright [ oiii ] magnitudes are an intrinsinc property of this pn population .",
    "_ mechanism leading to large core masses in the m87 halo pns - _ the initial mass - final mass relation ( ifmr ) for solar metallicity stars predicts that the pn progenitors with @xmath49 m@xmath3 give final core masses of @xmath50 m@xmath3 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "turnoff masses of @xmath51  m@xmath3 belong to populations with ages @xmath52 gyr @xcite .",
    "the question is whether such populations exist in the m87 halo or in the virgo diffuse stellar light .",
    "observations in the v , i bands of the stellar population in a 11.39 arcmin@xmath53 field halfway between m87 and m86 were carried out with the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) and the hst .",
    "this location falls within the f4 virgo field of @xcite and is included in the area surveyed by @xcite . at this location",
    ", @xcite detected some @xmath54 intracluster red giant branch stars ( irgb ) ; from the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , they estimated the age and metallicity distribution of the parent stellar population . in this region , 70% - 80% of the virgo irgb are old ( @xmath55 gyr ) , and span a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath56 < 0.0 $ ] ) , with a mean value of @xmath57 \\sim -1.0 $ ] .    from the number of pns within 0.5 mag of the pnlf cut - off , @xmath58",
    ", we can determine how much luminosity would be present in an intermediate age population and compare it with the measured surface photometry of @xcite in the surveyed region and the @xcite fit to the irgb cmd . if we assume the analytical formula of @xcite for the pnlf , then @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total number of pns associated with the luminosity of the parent stellar population .",
    "the luminosity - specific pn number @xmath61 is given by @xcite for stellar populations with different ages and metallicities , and calibrated using the pn population in the local group , leo group , and the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "the maximal theoretical value of @xmath62 which gives the largest pn population for a given luminosity is @xmath63 .",
    "this theoretical maximal value is independent of metallicity , and also provides an upper limit to the observed @xmath62 for the pn population in different galaxy types @xcite .    in the m87 halo",
    ", we have @xmath64 , which gives a total population of @xmath65 and a minimal bolometric luminosity of the parent population of @xmath66 over a total surveyed area of 570 arcmin@xmath53 .",
    "we can thus derive a lower limit to the mean surface brightness in the v band , @xmath67 mag arcsec@xmath68 , for a possible intermediate age parent population . comparing with @xmath69 measured by @xcite at the position of the @xcite field",
    ", we find that , to justify the number of bright pns , at least @xmath70% of the stars in this field would need to come from a 1 gyr population",
    ". however , the upper limit to the contribution of a younger ( @xmath71 gyr ) component to the irgb stars given by @xcite is 30% - 20% .",
    "we must then conclude that there are not enough intermediate age stars in the @xcite field to justify the observed @xmath58 .",
    "what are the possible alternatives , if an intermediate age population is not present ?",
    "the @xcite results indicate that the virgo core population of stars is dominated by low metallicity stars ( [ m / h]@xmath72 ) with ages @xmath55 gyr ; thus we may argue that the halo of m87 may be also metal poor . in this case",
    ", the pnlf might have a bright cutoff that is different from that of a metal rich population .",
    "however @xcite , and pnlf observations in metal - poor galaxies @xcite show that metal poor systems have values of @xmath73 that are fainter than those of their metal - rich counterparts .",
    "also the oxygen abundance measurements by @xcite of the brightest extragalactic pns in ngc  4697 indicate near solar metallicities for these stars .",
    "therefore pn evolution from a metal poor population is unlikely to be a viable explanation for the observed large core masses in the m87 halo pn .",
    "the evolution of single stars from a 10 gyr old population leads to central star masses in the range @xmath74m@xmath75 m@xmath3 @xcite , which can not supply the [ oiii ] 5007  flux required at the pnlf bright cut - off of @xmath76 .",
    "this led @xcite to propose an alternative form of evolution , i.e close binaries and blue stragglers stars , as the likely progenitors of [ oiii ] - bright pns in a @xmath77 gyr old stellar population .",
    "this evolutionary channel seems better in agreement with the observations for the brightest pns in the m87 halo , than either the @xmath52 gyr - old or the metal - poor progenitors .",
    "we have measured the nebular [ oiii ] 5007  spectroscopic expansion velocities for 11 pns in the virgo cluster core , at 15 mpc distance , with the flames spectrograph on the eso vlt . based on the [ oiii ] line profile width ,",
    "the average spectroscopic expansion velocity for this sample is @xmath0 kms@xmath1 ( rms = 2.6 kms@xmath1 ) , which is in agreement with the predictions of dynamically evolving nebular models for high density nebulae close to their maximal @xmath6 emission .",
    "large central star masses m@xmath78  m@xmath3 are inferred from the bright measured [ oiii ] luminosities and the known distance for the pns bound to the m87 halo . from the large central star masses and the measured @xmath5 ,",
    "we derive short pn visibility times and small nebular outer radii , @xmath39 pc .",
    "the pns in the m87 halo have large central star masses , are compact and their nebula shells may be similar to those observed for the brightest galactic bulge pns .",
    "three mechanisms are reviewed as possible explanation for the large core masses of the m87 halo pns : intermediate age population , metallicity effects , and blue stragglers , with the latter being the most likely , given the old age and the low metallicities of the irgb stars in the virgo core @xcite .",
