    "a more potent form of radiative feedback at high redshifts is the photoionizing background radiation that builds up during reionization . in regions which are reionized early , at e.g. @xmath0 @xmath1 15",

    ". this assumption could be relaxed slightly if we account for the photoevaporation of the gas inside minihaloes that is already somewhat collapsed , but we do not expect this to dramatically affect our results ( see e.g. shapiro et al .",
    "2004 ; iliev et al . 2005 ; wyithe & cen 2007 ) .",
    "a second condition for pop  iii star formation in unenriched dm haloes after reionization is that the dm haloes must be massive enough to allow the photoheated gas to cool and collapse .",
    "numerous studies have found that dm haloes must have circular velocities @xmath1 30 km  s@xmath9 in order for photoionized gas to collapse into them ( e.g. thoul & weinberg 1996 ; quinn et al .",
    "1996 ; kepner et al . 1997 ; kitayama et al .",
    "this limit may be lower at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath1 10 , due to the lower average intensity of the ionizing background and to the higher densities to which baryons may have already collapsed when the ionizing radiation turns on ( kitayama & ikeuchi 2000 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2004 ; see also chiba & nath 1994 ) .",
    "however , there is no concensus on what this limiting mass is in cosmological haloes ( wyithe & cen 2007 ) , and many previous calculations have been done assuming spherical symmetry ( but see the cosmological simulations of hoeft et al .",
    "2006 ) , which may underestimate the minimum halo mass , as asphericity can allow ionizing photons to penetrate deeper into haloes and reduce the effect of self - shielding ( see haiman 2008 ) .",
    "however , this is not necessarily so clear either , as dense filaments from which gas can accrete into cosmological haloes may also be self - shielding , in which case calculations in sperical symmetry would lead to an overestimate of the minimum mass . to account for some spread in the minimum mass required for gas to collapse into dm haloes ,",
    "we consider two possibilities for this minimum mass , corresponding to minimum circular velocities of 20 and 30 km s@xmath9 , given below :    @xmath19    @xmath20    using the extended press - schechter formalism ( lacey & cole 1993 ) , we calculate , as a function of redshift , the maximum mass @xmath21(@xmath22 ) of virialized dm haloes which have , on average , no minihalo progenitors with masses @xmath1 @xmath17 prior to redshift @xmath22 ; more precisely , we calculate the maximum mass of haloes which have @xmath23/@xmath24ln@xmath25 @xmath26 1 , where @xmath27 is the number of progenitor haloes at @xmath22 ( see e.g. bromm & clarke 2002 ) .",
    "this nomenclature is chosen to denote the redshift by which the region in which a halo forms must be reionized in order to prevent star formation in these minihalo progenitors .",
    "we compare this maximum mass , for five different choices of @xmath22 , to the minimum mass for star formation in figure 1 . only in haloes with masses below the maximum halo mass @xmath21(@xmath22 ) and above the minimum mass , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , at a given redshift @xmath0 can the reionized gas remain pristine and unenriched until it collapses to form stars . accordingly , in regions reionized at @xmath22 @xmath3 25 , primordial star formation may take place at @xmath0 @xmath2 12.5 , on average , if the minimum halo mass is @xmath28 .",
    "if , instead , the minimum halo mass is @xmath29 then primordial star formation can only take place at @xmath0 @xmath2 8 . also , the most massive haloes that can host metal - free star formation form at @xmath0 @xmath2 4 in regions that are reionized at @xmath22 = 19 and 23 , for a minimum halo mass of @xmath28 or @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "indeed , due to the increase in the minimum mass for star formation with decreasing redshift , it is only in regions reionized at @xmath0 @xmath1 19 in which pop  iii star formation can take place in reionized regions of the universe , unless the minimum halo mass for star formation is considerably smaller than @xmath28 .    to summarize ,",
    "two minimum requirements for the formation of a pop  iii star cluster in an unenriched dm halo after reionization , i.e. at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath2 6 , are the following ( see also fig .",
    "2 ) :    \\(1 ) the halo must not have any progenitors which host star formation .",
    "this implies a maximum halo mass @xmath21(@xmath22 ) , above which star formation occurs in progenitor minihaloes that form prior to the redshift @xmath22 at which the gas is reionized .",
    "after @xmath22 , photoheating of the gas prevents star formation , and the gas remains unenriched .",
    "\\(2 ) the halo must be massive enough for photoheated gas to collapse into it and form stars .",
    "this implies a minimum halo mass @xmath30 , below which stars are unable to form .",
    "we thus take it that only haloes with masses @xmath1 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath21 can host the formation of primordial stars in reionized regions of the universe .",
    "a third requirement is that the haloes are not enriched by galactic winds emanating from neighboring star - forming haloes , as shown schematically in figure 2 .",
    "such external chemical enrichment will limit the abundance of unenriched haloes ; this is discussed further in the next section .",
    "now that we have the redshift and mass distribution of dm haloes which may potentially host pop  iii star formation in reionized regions of the universe , we would like to estimate the abundance of such haloes as a function of redshift , thereby finding an upper limit for the abundance of pop  iii star clusters . as shown in section 2",
    ", these haloes can only form in the relatively rare regions of the universe that were reionized at very early times , i.e. at @xmath22 @xmath1 19 , meaning that these haloes are relatively rare objects . while the early reionization history is only poorly constrained by observational data ,",
    "there have recently been conducted a number of large - scale high - resolution simulations of this process which yield useful results for our purposes ( e.g. iliev et al . 2007 ; shin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "shin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report their result for the volume fraction @xmath32(@xmath22 ) of the universe that is reionized , as a function of redshift , up to @xmath22 @xmath3 22 . for our calculation",
    ", we use the following formula , which provides a satisfactory fit to their results over the range of redshifts @xmath22 that we consider ( i.e. 19 @xmath2 @xmath22 @xmath2 25 ) :    @xmath33    the rate of change of the collapse fraction @xmath34(@xmath22 , @xmath0 ) of mass in haloes which may host pop  iii star formation at redshift @xmath0 , if forming in regions that are reionized at @xmath22 , is given by the rate at which mass becomes incorporated in haloes with the minimum mass for star formation , as follows :    @xmath35    here @xmath36(@xmath37,@xmath0 ) is the collapse fraction in dm haloes with masses @xmath38 @xmath37 at redshift @xmath0 , as given by the sheth - tormen formalism ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath30 is the minimum mass for star formation , given either by equation ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) .",
    "as the sheth - tormen formalism gives the fraction of mass that is collapsed , it is more appropriate to use the fraction of mass @xmath39 that is reionized than the volume - filling fraction @xmath32 for our calculation .",
    "we shall assume that the mass fraction of the universe that is reionized is a factor of ten higher than the volume - filling fraction @xmath32 given in equation ( 3 ) at 19 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 25 , due to the relatively large overdensities of the rare regions that are reionized so early .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the results of shin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who report that at @xmath0 @xmath3 20 the volume - filling fraction of h  ii regions is of the order of 10@xmath40 while the fraction of the gas that is ionized is of the order of 10@xmath41 , implying an average overdensity of the h  ii regions of the order of ten ( see also furlanetto et al .",
    "accounting for this fraction @xmath42 of the baryonic mass in the universe that was reionized before @xmath22 , we integrate over @xmath22 to find the total number density of haloes virializing at redshift @xmath0 which are unenriched by previous star formation . assuming that a single pop  iii star cluster with a lifetime of @xmath43 forms in every unenriched halo , we thus estimate the comoving number density of pop  iii clusters as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the critical density of the universe , assuming a hubble constant h@xmath46 = 70.5 km  s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ( komatsu et al . 2009 ) , and @xmath47 is the fraction of this density in dark matter .",
    "the integral is taken from @xmath22 = 19 to 25 , because unenriched haloes with masses @xmath1 @xmath30 only form in regions reionized before @xmath22 = 19 , as found in the previous section , and because before @xmath22 = 25 such a small fraction of the universe is reionized that little contribution would be made to the integral for higher @xmath22 . finally , we divide by the minimum halo mass to find the number density of haloes .",
    "we plot two curves for the number density @xmath48 of pop  iii star clusters in the top panel of figure 3 , one for each of the choices of @xmath30 , given by equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the more massive haloes with mass @xmath29 are much rarer than those with mass @xmath28 for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the overall abundance of dm haloes generally decreases with halo mass .",
    "the second reason is that more massive haloes have minihalo progenitors at higher redshift , meaning that on average they form only in the regions in which star formation is suppressed by reionization at higher @xmath22 , and which are correspondingly more rare . for reasons discussed in dijkstra",
    "( 2004 ) , the lower minimum mass may be more accurate at higher redshift , @xmath0 @xmath2 10 , while at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath2 3 the higher minimum mass is likely more accurate .",
    "if this is so , then the comoving number density of pop  iii star clusters may remain below @xmath3 10@xmath14  gpc@xmath41 at all redshifts .",
    "this would be consistent with the upper limit on the abundance of pop  iii clusters at @xmath0 @xmath3 4 found by nagao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "these authors report the non - detection of strong emitters of both ly@xmath6 and he  ii @xmath71640 within a comoving volume of 4.03 @xmath10 10@xmath49 mpc@xmath15 in the subaru deep field at 3.93 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 4.01 and 4.57 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 4.65 .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the number density of pop  iii clusters of @xmath48 @xmath3 2500 gpc@xmath41 , between the upper limits plotted in fig . 3 for minimum halo masses of m@xmath50 and m@xmath51 .",
    "while this upper limit suggests that either the minimum halo mass for star formation is higher than @xmath52 at low redshifts or that metal enrichment by galactic winds is relatively rapid ( see section 3.2 ) , we note that the limiting flux of the survey would have allowed to detect only the brightest clusters ( see section 4 ) .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 , we plot the number density of pop  iii star clusters per degree observed on the sky per redshift interval @xmath53@xmath0 . we also plot the inverse of the 100 arcmin@xmath54 area of the planned deep - wide survey ( dws ) to be conducted by the jwst , in which pop  iii star clusters may be detected ( gardner et al . 2006 ) ; this corresponds to the number density of clusters that is required for there to be at least one cluster within this survey area , on average , per unit redshift .",
    "the number of clusters that the jwst may detect is clearly very sensitive to the minimum halo mass for star formation ; most optimistically , for @xmath28 , there may be up to @xmath3 100 clusters out to @xmath0 @xmath3 6 per dws area .",
    "however , for a minimum halo mass of @xmath29 the total number density is too low for the detection of even a single cluster in such a survey . a larger survey area of , for example , 17 @xmath10 17 arcmin@xmath54 for the e - elt ( eso elt science working group ) would , of course , provide a better chance to detect pop  iii clusters .",
    "as shown in equation ( 5 ) , the number density of pop  iii clusters is linearly proportional to the lifetime @xmath43 of an individual cluster .",
    "thus one impediment to the detection of pop  iii clusters is their brief lifetime . because a halo becomes enriched with metals once the first sne explode , the lifetime of a purely primordial cluster is in part determined by the lifetime of the massive stars which explode as sne , which is , at most , of the order of 10@xmath16 yrs ( schaerer 2002 )",
    "however , the timescale for the formation of second - generation , pop  ii stars from the enriched gas is also dependent on the timescale for the mixing of metal - enriched sne ejecta with the primordial gas , which could be @xmath1 10@xmath11 yr ( see e.g. de avillez & mac low 2002 ) . in this case , the timescale for the formation of enriched stars would be similarly long ; accordingly , the abundance of dm haloes hosting only pop  iii stars would be @xmath1 50 times higher than in the fiducial case of @xmath43 = 2 @xmath10 10@xmath55 yr shown in fig .",
    "we emphasize , though , that it is the most massive stars which are the most luminous and hence it is during the lifetime of these stars , a few times 10@xmath55 yrs , that a cluster is most easily detectable ( see section 4 ) , meaning that the brightest clusters are also likely to be the rarest .",
    "while in figure 3 we have only plotted the pop  iii cluster abundances for one value of the minimum halo mass @xmath17 = 10@xmath18 required for star formation in minihalos , this minimum halo mass is an uncertain quantity and may be higher if a persistant lw background radiation field is present ( e.g. oshea & norman 2008 ; trenti & stiavelli 2009 ) .",
    "if @xmath17 is indeed higher , then the abundance of pop  iii clusters would be higher as well , since these potentially star - forming progenitor minihaloes would form at lower redshifts when @xmath39 is considerably higher . for a minimum minihalo mass an order of magnitude higher , @xmath17 = 10@xmath56 , we find that the upper limits on the abundance of pop  iii star clusters may be roughly an order of magnitude higher than those shown in fig .",
    "3 .",
    "we have so far considered the formation of star clusters in dm haloes which are unenriched by star formation in their progenitors .",
    "however , metal enrichment can also take place via galactic winds launched by neighboring star - forming galaxies ( e.g. nath & trentham 1997 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; cen & bryan 2001 ; madau et al .",
    "2001 ; mori et al . 2002 ; scannapieco et al . 2003 ; bertone et al . 2005 ; tornatore et al .",
    "as such external metal enrichment was ignored in the last section , our results so far for the number density of pop  iii clusters are only upper limits .",
    "to estimate the extent to which galactic winds enrich the igm and thereby prevent pop  iii star formation , we compute the volume - filling fraction @xmath57 of the igm that is reionized at @xmath0 @xmath1 19 which these winds sweep up , as a function of redshift .",
    "as we are interested in the metal enrichment of reionized regions , we assume that winds only originate from dm haloes with masses greater than the minimum mass for star formation in reionized regions . while haloes with masses @xmath3 @xmath30 will be the much more abundant than more massive haloes ( see e.g. reed et al .",
    "2007 ) , the winds emanating from the galaxies which form in these haloes are likely to be rather weak , as the star formation efficiency in these haloes is low ( e.g. furlanetto & loeb 2003 ; samui et al .",
    "2008 ) , due to the haloes retaining only a rather small fraction ( @xmath3 10 - 20 percent ) of their gas due to photoheating ( e.g. thoul & wienberg 1996 ; see also shen et al .",
    ". however , the regions of interest to us are in close proximity to the descendants of the first galaxies which reionized their surroundings at @xmath22 @xmath1 20 . as these first galaxies formed in haloes with masses of @xmath1 5 @xmath10 10@xmath16 m@xmath5 at @xmath0 @xmath1 20 ( trac & cen 2007 ) , their descendants , on average , are rare haloes with masses @xmath1 10@xmath58 m@xmath5 at @xmath0 @xmath2 10 , as found using the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "these galaxies likely began enriching the igm already at @xmath0 @xmath3 20 , and because star formation is likely to proceed with a high efficiency within such massive haloes , we expect that these galaxies launch the metal - enriched winds which are principally responsible for enriching the otherwise pristine haloes we are considering . thus , under this assumption , as described schematically in figure 2 , it is the same galaxies which reionize the primordial gas at early times , thereby suppressing star formation and metal enrichment , that are also the sources of metal - enriched winds which prevent pop  iii star formation at later times .",
    "to model this enrichment process in a simple way , we assume that a single galaxy launches a wind from the center of each h  ii region at redshift @xmath0 @xmath3 20 , and we take it that each h  ii region encloses a comoving volume @xmath59 = 1 mpc@xmath15  @xmath60 at this redshift . while shin et al .",

    "for the expected sed of a cluster of young pop  iii stars the luminosity in ly@xmath6 is roughly an order of magnitude greater than the stellar and nebular continuum luminosity in the wavelength range covered by a given nircam filter ( assuming a small escape fraction @xmath86)(e.g .",

    "an important next step to better estimate the abundance of pop  iii star clusters will be to carry out cosmological simulations which capture the earliest stages of the inhomogeneous reionization of the universe , as well as the chemical enrichment from both the first stars formed in minihaloes and large - scale galactic winds .",
    "we note that the cosmological metal - enrichment simulations presented in tornatore et al .",
    "( 2007 ) already provide some indication that pop  iii clusters may form in rare regions after reionization .",
    "in addition , cosmological radiative transfer simulations may be necessary to estimate the masses , and so the luminosities , of stellar clusters that form in the dm haloes into which the reionized primordial gas is first able collapse in the course of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "related to this , magnetic fields pervading the reionized gas may have an important dynamical effect on the formation of pop  iii star clusters at low redshifts ( see schleicher et al .",
    "2009a ) ; simulations tracking the growth and evolution of magnetic fields in the igm would thus also be of interest .",
    "furthermore , in the present work we have only considered the average merger history of a potential pop  iii star - forming halo , ignoring the range of possible merger histories that such haloes may have . this assumption would clearly be relaxed within the context of a cosmological simulation .",
    "although we have accounted for the higher average density of regions which are reionized at early times with our choice of @xmath39 in equation ( 5 ) , we have otherwise assumed that the haloes in which pop  iii star clusters form are not biased , i.e. that these haloes are otherwise located randomly in space . in principle",

    "therefore , we expect that accounting for the detailed clustering properties of these haloes around the descendants of the sources of reionization at @xmath0 @xmath3 20 would not change our results substantially , although the effect of bias should be considered in more depth in future studies .",
    "another implicit assumption throughout this work has been that stellar clusters will form in the pristine dm haloes which are massive enough for the gas to collapse into them after reionization .",
    "there is the possibility that this gas could instead collapse to form a @xmath1 10@xmath14 m@xmath5 black hole directly , if molecular cooling is suppressed ( e.g. bromm & loeb 2003 ; begelman et al .",

    "<S> in reionized regions of the universe , gas can only collapse to form stars in dark matter ( dm ) haloes which grow to be sufficiently massive . </S>",
    "<S> if star formation is prevented in the minihalo progenitors of such dm haloes at redshifts @xmath0  @xmath1  20 , then these haloes will not be self - enriched with metals and so may host population ( pop ) iii star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate an upper limit for the abundance of pop iii star clusters which thus form in the reionized universe , as a function of redshift . depending on the minimum dm halo mass for star formation , between of the order of one and of the order of a thousand pop  iii star clusters per square degree may be observable at 2 @xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath2 7 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there may be a sufficient number density of pop  iii star clusters for detection in surveys such as the deep - wide survey ( dws ) to be conducted by the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that pop  iii clusters formed after reionization are most likely to be found at @xmath0 @xmath1 3 and within @xmath3 40 arcsec ( @xmath3 1 mpc comoving ) of dm haloes with masses of @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 , the descendants of the haloes at @xmath0 @xmath3 20 which host the first galaxies that begin reionization . </S>",
    "<S> however , if star formation is inefficient in the haloes hosting pop  iii clusters due to the photoionizing background radiation , these clusters may not be bright enough for detection by the near - infrared camera which will conduct the dws . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , if the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is top - heavy the clusters may have sufficiently high luminosities in both ly@xmath6 and he  ii  @xmath71640 to be detected and for constraints to be placed on the pop  iii imf . while a small fraction of dm haloes with masses as high as @xmath3 10@xmath8 m@xmath5 at redshifts @xmath0 @xmath2 4 are not enriched due to star formation in their progenitors , </S>",
    "<S> external metal enrichment due to galactic winds is likely to preclude pop  iii star formation in a large fraction of otherwise unenriched haloes , perhaps even preventing star formation in pristine haloes altogether after reionization is complete at @xmath0  @xmath3  6 .    </S>",
