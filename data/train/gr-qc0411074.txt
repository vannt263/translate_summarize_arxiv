    "the idea that the universe may have more than 4 dimensions is due to kaluza ( 1921 ) , who with a brilliant insight realized that a 5d manifold could be used to unify einstein s theory of general relativity with maxwell s theory of electromagnetism .",
    "after some delay , einstein endorsed the idea , but a major impetus was provided by klein ( 1926 ) .",
    "he made the connection to quantum theory by assuming that the extra dimension was microscopically small , with a size in fact connected via the planck s constant to the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "the development of particle physics , quantum field theory and the strings theory led to a resurgence of interest in higher dimensional field theories as a means of unifying the long range and short range interactions of physics .",
    "thus kaluza - klein 5d theory lay the foundation for modern developments such as 10d superstrings and 11d supergravity .",
    "there are several versions of this theory such as noncompactified induced matter or space - time - matter theory .",
    "the kaluza - klein theory is essentially general relativity in 5d , and physically have the motivation of explaining why we perceive 4 dimensions of the space - time and ( apparently ) do not see the fifth dimension .",
    "it is constrained by two conditions .",
    "( 1 ) the so called `` cylinder condition '' was introduced by kaluza , and consists in setting all partial derivatives with respect to the fifth coordinate to zero .",
    "( 2 ) the condition of compactification was introduced by klein , and consists in the assumption that the fifth dimension is not small in size but has a closed topology ( a circle if we are only considering one extra dimension ) .",
    "it is a constraint that may be applied retroactively to a solution .",
    "this condition introduces periodicity and allows one to use fourier and other descompositions of the theory .",
    "the field equations would logically be expected to be @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 ) with some appropiate coupling constant @xmath2 and a @xmath3 energy momentum tensor . from the time of kaluza - klein onward",
    "much work has been done with the `` apparent vacuum '' or `` empty '' form of the field equations @xmath4 . in the practice",
    "is very difficult determine that relations without some starting assumption about @xmath5 .",
    "this is usually connected with the physical situation being investigated .",
    "in gravitational theory , an assumption about @xmath6 is commonly called a choice of coordinates , while in particle physics it is commonly called a choice of gauge .",
    "the traditional kaluza - klein theory has been worked by many people , including jordan@xcite , bergmann@xcite , lessner@xcite , thiry@xcite , and liu and wesson@xcite . in this theory",
    "the coordinates are chosen so as to write the 5d metric tensor in the form @xmath7 where @xmath2 is a coupling constant .",
    "then the einstein s field equations in the vacuum reduce to : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 . in these equations @xmath12 is the einstein s tensor , @xmath13 is the maxwell s tensor and @xmath14 is the energy - momentum tensor for an electromagnetic field given by @xmath15 .",
    "also @xmath16 is the wave operator , and summation convention is in effect .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : p3 ] ) are the 4 equations of electromagnetism modified by a function , which by ( [ eq : p4 ] ) can be thought of as depending on a wave - like scalar field .",
    "the right side of ( [ eq : p2 ] ) in some sense represents an energy - momentum tensor that is effectively derived from the fifth dimension . in short",
    "the traditional kaluza - klein theory is in general a unified account of gravity , electromagnetism and scalar field . in the language of particle physics",
    ", the field equations @xmath4 of kaluza - klein theory describe a spin-2 graviton , a spin-1 photon and a spin-0 boson which is connected with howparticles acquire mass .",
    "einstein introduce the idea that the physical quantities should be given a geometrical interpretation , as envisaged by many people through time .",
    "an early attempt at this was made by kaluza and klein , who extended general relativity from 4 to 5 dimensions , but also applied severe restrictions to the geometry ( the condition of cylindricity and compactification ) . in the 90 s paul wesson and",
    "ponce de leon showed that it is possible to interpret most properties of matter as the result of 5d riemannian geometry , where however the latter allows dependence on the fifth coordinate and does not make assumptions about the topology of the fifth dimension .",
    "this theory is called the induced matter theory .",
    "the induced matter theory has seen most work in 3 areas : the case of uniform cosmological models , the soliton case and the case of neutral matter .",
    "the first case is easiest to trate because of the high degree of symmetry involved .",
    "the second case is more complicated , but important because 5d solitons are the analogs of isolated 4d masses , and the 5d class of soliton solution contains the unique 4d schwarzschild solution . the last case can be treated quite generally , and lays the foundation for many applications where electromagnetic effects are not involved .",
    "we are going to give a briefly review of the main features considering only the cosmological case .",
    "the other cases go beyond the scope of this work .    in the cosmological context",
    "the extra dimension is already known to be of great importance for cosmology .",
    "there is a class of 5d cosmological models which reduce to the usual four dimensional ones , on hypersuperfaces defined by setting the value of the extra coordinate constant . in these models",
    "the matter is explained as the consequence of geometry in five dimensions .",
    "the physics of this follows from a mathematical results .",
    "the basic idea of this models is explained below .",
    "the 5d einstein s field equations for apparent vacuum are : @xmath17 where the 5d einstein s tensor is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the 5d ricci s tensor and @xmath5 the 5d metric .",
    "the central thesis of induced matter theory is that from equations ( [ eq : p5 ] ) we obtain the 4d field equations with matter given by : @xmath20 in other words , the equations ( [ eq : p6 ] ) are a subset of ( [ eq : p5 ] ) with an effective or induced 4d energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 which contains the classical properties of matter .",
    "this idea can be explained as a consequence of the campell s theorem .",
    "it says that any analytic n - dimensional riemannian manifold can be locally embedded in an ( n+1)-dimensional ricci flat riemannian manifold@xcite .",
    "this is of great importance for establishing the generality of the proposal that 4d field equations with sources can be locally embedded in 5d field equations without sources . besides",
    ", it can be used to study lower dimensional gravity @xmath21@xcite .",
    "it can be employed to find new classes of 5d solutions@xcite .",
    "some of the latter have the remarkable property that they are 5d flat but contain 4d subspaces that are curved and correspond to known physical situations@xcite .",
    "however , the principle is clear : curved 4d physics can be embedded in curved or flat 5d geometry .    in this theory",
    "an exact solution of ( [ eq : p5 ] ) is of cosmological type if resembles that of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) , and the dynamics is governed by equations like those of friedmann .",
    "paul wesson , ponce de leon and co - workers founded several classes of exact cosmological solutions of ( [ eq : p5 ] ) whose metrics are separable and reduce to the standard 4d frw ones on the hypersurfaces with the fifth coordinate constant .",
    "following the idea suggested by wesson and co - workers and to illustrate the transition from 5d field equations ( [ eq : p5 ] ) for apparent vacuum to the 4d equations ( [ eq : p6 ] ) with matter , it is convenient to start considering a 3d spatially , isotropic and flat spherically symmetric 5d line element : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the fifth coordinate .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are separable functions of the variables @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "the equations for the relevant einstein s elements are : @xmath29 + e^{-\\gamma } \\left[\\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star\\star}{\\beta}}{2}+ \\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}^2}{2}- \\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star}{\\gamma}\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}}{4}\\right ] , \\label{eq : p8}\\ ] ] @xmath30 , \\label{eq : p9}\\ ] ] @xmath31   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e^{-\\gamma}\\left[\\stackrel{\\star\\star}{\\beta } + \\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}^2}{4}+ \\frac{\\stackrel{\\star\\star}{\\alpha}}{2}+ \\frac{\\stackrel{\\star}{\\alpha}^2}{4}+ \\frac{\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}\\stackrel{\\star}{\\alpha}}{2}- \\frac{\\stackrel{\\star}{\\gamma}\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}}{2}- \\frac{\\stackrel{\\star}{\\alpha}\\stackrel{\\star}{\\gamma}}{4}\\right ] , \\label{eq : p10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32 + e^{-\\gamma}\\left[\\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}^2}{4}+ \\frac{3\\stackrel{\\star}{\\beta}\\stackrel{\\star}{\\alpha}}{4}\\right ] , \\label{eq : p11}\\ ] ] where the overstar and the overdot denote , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "following the convention @xmath36 for the 4d metric , we define @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( we are considering a 3d isotropic and homogeneous universe ) , where @xmath39 is the total energy density and @xmath40 is the pressure .",
    "the 5d vacuum conditions ( [ eq : p5 ] ) are given by [ 17 ] : @xmath41 @xmath42 , \\label{eq:13}\\ ] ] @xmath43= e^{\\gamma}\\left[\\frac{\\ddot{\\beta}}{2}+\\frac{3\\dot{\\beta}^2}{2}- \\frac{\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\beta}}{4}\\right ] , \\label{eq:14}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the gravitational constant .",
    "hence , from the equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) and taking @xmath45 , we obtain the equation of state for the induced matter : @xmath46 notice that for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( or zero ) , this equation describes an inflationary universe .",
    "the equality @xmath49 corresponds with a 4d de sitter expansion for the universe .",
    "this theory is gauge depending because for different choice of coordinates , one have several metrics all of them solutions of ( [ eq : p5 ] ) . in 1988",
    "ponce de leon obtained one of the classes of solutions to ( [ eq : p5 ] ) which are solutions of cosmological and astrophysical importance . with those line elements",
    "is possible to develop models that reduce to the standard frw ones with flat 3d space sections on hypersurfaces @xmath50@xcite .",
    "this is one of the most interesting aspects of this theory because one can ensure that the 5d models reduce to the 4d on hypersurfaces @xmath51 .",
    "taking the solution @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the basic line element ( [ eq : p7 ] ) can be written : @xmath55 + \\alpha^{2}(1-\\alpha)^{-2}t^{2}d\\psi^{2 } , \\label{eq : p16}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a constant related in the space - time - matter ( stm ) theory to the properties of matter .",
    "this constant is determined by induced energy momentum tensor related at the theory . from the einstein s equations and eq .",
    "( [ eq : p16 ] ) the equations of state are : @xmath57 the choice @xmath58 gives @xmath59 which is typical of radiation , and a scale factor @xmath60 .",
    "the choice @xmath61 gives @xmath62 which is typical of dust , and a scale factor that grows as @xmath63 .",
    "thus on hypersurfaces @xmath50 the standard models for the early and late universe are recovered .",
    "the coordinates in ( [ eq : p16 ] ) are spatially comoving as in the usual presentation of the 4d models .",
    "that is , @xmath64 .",
    "the other components can be found by solving the 5d geodesic equation to be : @xmath65 if we now change coordinates to : @xmath66 we find @xmath67 and : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the density and pressure ( [ eq : p17 ] ) change to : @xmath70 energy density and pressure are identical to their 4d values for radiation and dust , without @xmath24 factor .",
    "the presence or absence of the latter , and the question of whether @xmath71 is zero or not , clearly depends on the choice of coordinates .",
    "so the functional form of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can change depending on the choice of the fifth coordinate .",
    "this feature means that a 5d model may take different 4d guises depending on the coordinate frame .",
    "a particularly interesting consequence of 5d covariance may be derived by considering the simple coordinate transformation : @xmath72^{(1 - 2\\alpha)/\\alpha } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\psi&=&\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)t^{1/\\alpha}\\psi^{1/(1-\\alpha ) } \\left(1-\\frac{r^2}{\\alpha^2}\\right)+\\frac{\\alpha}{2(1 - 2\\alpha ) } \\left[t^{-1}\\psi^{\\alpha/(1-\\alpha)}\\right]^{(1 - 2\\alpha)/\\alpha}. \\label{eq : p22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the line element ( [ eq : p16 ] ) becomes : @xmath73 which is manifestly flat .",
    "this surprising result may be verified by computer , which shows that all of the components of the riemann - christoffel tensor for the 5d metric ( [ eq : p16 ] ) are zero . despite this , the model s 4d part is not flat , since the 4d ricci scalar may be calculated to be @xmath74 .",
    "we see that while the universe may be curved in 4d , it is flat in 5d .",
    "if we have a conclusion in the space time matter theory is that one extra dimension is enough to explain the phenomenological properties of classical matter . for a complete treatment you must to see@xcite",
    "in a cosmological context , the energy density of scalar fields has been reconized to contribute to the expansion of the universe@xcite , and has been proposed to explain inflation@xcite , as well as the presently observed accelerated expansion@xcite .",
    "the observed isotropy and homogeneity of the universe do not allow for the existence of long - range electric and magnetic fields , but neutral scalar fields can have non - trivial dynamics in an expanding frw - type universe .",
    "an attempt to confront the data with the predictions for a minimally coupled scalar field with an a priori unknown potential was made recently@xcite .    a very important question in theoretical physics consists to provide a good geometrical description of matter using only one extra coordinate ( say @xmath24 ) . the explanation of this issue in the framework of the early universe , in particular for inflationary theory@xcite , should be of great importance in cosmology . in this section ,",
    "we are aimed to study this topic using the kaluza - klein formalism where the fifth coordinate is noncompact . in this framework",
    "should be interesting to explain the origin of an effective four dimensional ( 4d ) scalar potential @xmath75 which could be originated from a 5d apparent vacuum .",
    "for example , an attempt to understand inflation [ which is governed by the neutral scalar ( inflaton ) field ] , from a 5d flat riemannian manifold was made in@xcite . during inflation ,",
    "the scale factor of the universe accelerates and this acceleration is driven by the potential energy related with the self - interactions of a scalar field .",
    "however , campell s theorem implies that all inflationary solutions can be generated , at least in principle , from a 5d vacuum einstein gravity@xcite .",
    "but , could be possible to develop a formalism to describe all the evolution of the universe ?",
    "the other aim of this section consists to develop a 5d mechanism inspired in the campbell s theorem , to explain the ( neutral scalar field governed ) evolution of the universe from a initially inflationary ( superluminical ) expansion that has a change of phase towards a decelerated ( radiation and later matter dominated ) expansion and thereinafter evolves towards the present day observed accelerated expansion ( quintessence)@xcite . although campell s theorem relates n - dimensional theories to vacuum @xmath76-dimensional theories , it does not establish a strict equivalence between them . it is therefore important to determinate when such teories are equivalent .",
    "two notions of equivalence that could be considered are dynamical equivalence and geodesic equivalence .",
    "dynamical equivalence would imply that the dynamics of vacuum n - dimensional theories is included in a vacuum @xmath76-dimensional theories .",
    "alternatively , one may consider geodesic equivalence , in the sense on mashhoon et al.@xcite . in this case",
    "the @xmath77 geodesic equation induces a @xmath78 geodesic equation plus a force ( per unity of mass ) term @xmath79 : @xmath80 for the geodesic equivalence approach one would therefore require @xmath81 , that describes the trajectories of free - falling observers . in this work",
    "we shall use the geodesic equivalence approach .    in the last years extra",
    "force and extra mass has been subject of study @xcite .",
    "it should be an observable effect from extra dimensions on the 4d spacetime .",
    "the final aim of this section is to extend the hamilton - jacobi formalism developed by ponce de leon@xcite to cosmological models where the expansion of the universe is governed by a single inflaton field .",
    "this interpretation has the adventage of being free of the complications and ambiguities of the geodesic approach .      to make it , we consider the 5d metric introduced by ledesma and bellini@xcite @xmath82 where @xmath23 . here , the coordenates ( @xmath83,@xmath84 ) are dimensionless , the fifth coordinate @xmath85 has spatial unities and @xmath86 is a dimensionless parameter that can take the values @xmath87 . the metric ( [ 6 ] ) describes a flat 5d manifold in apparent vacuum ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider a diagonal metric because we are dealing only with gravitational effects , which are the important ones in the global evolution for the universe . to describe neutral matter in a 5d geometrical vacuum ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we can consider the lagrangian @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the absolute value of the determinant for the 5d metric tensor with components @xmath5 and @xmath90 is a constant of dimensionalization determined by @xmath91 evaluated at @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in this work we shall consider @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 . here",

    "furthermore , we shall consider an action @xmath97 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] for a scalar field @xmath98 , which is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "here , @xmath99 es the 5d ricci scalar , which of course , is zero for the 5d flat metric ( [ 6 ] ) and @xmath44 is the gravitational constant . since the 5d metric ( [ 6 ] ) describes a manifold in apparent vacuum , the density lagrangian @xmath100 in ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is @xmath101 which represents a free scalar field .",
    "in other words , we define the vacuum as a purely kinetic 5d - lagrangian on a globally 5d - flat metric [ in our case , the metric ( [ 6 ] ) ] . taking into account the metric ( [ 6 ] ) and the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion for @xmath98 @xmath102 where @xmath103 is zero because the coordinates @xmath104 are independents .    in this work",
    "we shall consider the case where @xmath105 .",
    "the relevant christoffel symbols for the geodesic of the 5d metric ( [ 6 ] ) in a 3d comoving frame @xmath106 , are @xmath107 so that the geodesic dynamics @xmath108 is described by the following equations of motion for the velocities @xmath109 @xmath110 where the eq .",

    "thus , the fifth coordinate evolves as @xmath120 from the mathematical point of view , we are taking a foliation of the 5d metric ( [ 6 ] ) with @xmath84 constant .",
    "hence , to describe the metric in physical coordinates we must to make the following transformations : @xmath121 such that for @xmath122 , we obtain the 5d metric @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a constant and @xmath125 is the effective hubble parameter defined from the effective scale factor of the universe @xmath126 .",
    "the metric ( [ nme ] ) describes a 5d generalized frw metric , which is 3d spatially flat [ i.e. , it is flat in terms of @xmath127 , isotropic and homogeneous . in the representation @xmath128 , the velocities @xmath129 ,",

    "so , the parameter @xmath86 is introduced in the metric ( [ nme ] ) to preserve the hyperbolic condition ( [ con ] ) .",

    "<S> this paper is a review of a recently introduced cosmological model from a noncompact kaluza - klein theory for a single scalar field minimally coupled to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the 4d scalar potential has a geometrical origin and assume different representations in different frames </S>",
    "<S> . it should be responsible for the expansion of the universe . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> we explain the ( neutral scalar field governed ) evolution of the universe from an initially inflationary expansion that has a change of phase towards a decelerated expansion and thereinafter evolves towards the present day observed accelerated ( quintessential ) expansion </S>",
    "<S> . finally , using the hamilton - jacobi formalism , we study extra force and extra mass from this 5d cosmological model .    .5 cm    .2 cm </S>"
