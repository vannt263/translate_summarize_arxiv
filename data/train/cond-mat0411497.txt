    "polymer blends are systems of fundamental scientific interest .",
    "their structural and dynamical properties change as a function of the proximity to thermodynamic conditions of phase separation ( i.e. , their spinodal curve ) .",
    "blends have many practical applications since new materials can be produced with specific physical and chemical properties by simply mixing polymer melt components that have the desired characteristics .",
    "finally , polymeric materials used in daily life are usually mixtures of polymers with different chain length and/or different local structure .",
    "understanding how the mixing of polymer melts modifies their properties has been a relevant and longstanding scientific and technological goal in polymer physics and engineering.@xcite from a theoretical perspective , relevant work in this direction has been developed by several groups in recent years.@xcite    a great deal of information on the correlation between local ( intra- and intermolecular ) structure and global fluid properties has been obtained by computer simulations of polymer mixtures.@xcite one of the challenges in simulating polymer blends is the large range of length- and timescales that need to be investigated .",
    "blend properties strongly depend on the local bond lengthscale ( short timescale ) , since mixtures of polymers with different local chemical structure can lead to dramatically different physical properties , including , for example , an opposite trend in demixing with temperature . on the other end",
    ", properties need to be investigated on the large lengthscale ( long timescale ) of concentration fluctuations , which diverges approaching the spinodal decomposition . in this regime ,",
    "the box size of the system simulated becomes the upper limit in resolution .    to expedite computer simulations",
    ", it is useful to renormalize the system by adopting a coarse - grained description of the liquid . the goal is to have a formalism that allows us to simulate macroscopic behavior while retaining information about the detailed atomistic chemical structure of polymer chains .",
    "the overall behavior of blend materials has to be related , through a well - defined and reversible procedure , to the local chemical structure of the system . as a first step",
    ", a convenient approach is to introduce a united atom ( ua ) description of the polymer chain : a commonly adopted method in simulations of polymer melts and blends.@xcite a more drastic renormalization at the lengthscale of the polymer size was proposed by dautenhahn and hall@xcite and later on by murat and kremer@xcite , who mapped a blend of polymer chains onto a liquid of colloidal particles interacting through phenomenological soft - core potentials .",
    "recently , hansen and coworkers have developed a rigorous numerical methodology to derive an effective potential for polymers in solution using liquid state theory.@xcite    an analytical solution of the c.o.m .",
    "mean - force potential for a melt was derived by one of the authors.@xcite the potential is qualitatively in agreement with the physical behavior observed in simulation data .",
    "for example , when compared with the classical solution by flory and krigbaum,@xcite it has the advantage of correctly predicting greater interpenetration between two chains with increasing degree of polymerization , chain stiffness , and/or liquid density .",
    "however , since the derivation does not include explicitly chain connectivity , the analytical solution reproduces the short - scale simulation behavior after fitting the value of the intermolecular potential at complete interpolymer overlap.@xcite more recently we derived an analytical expression for the potential of mean - force in polymer melts , which reproduces well , and with no adjustable parameters , data from ua molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of chains with different degree of polymerization and local chemical structure.@xcite this coarse - grained potential is an explicit function of atomistic chain parameters , such as degree of polymerization and local semiflexibility , thereby correctly bridging different lengthscales of interest .",
    "it is clearly advantageous to have an analytical form of the potential versus a numerical one , obtained form the inversion of computer simulation data .",
    "since the mean - force potential is a free energy , it depends on the thermodynamic state of the system considered . a numerical calculation of the potential would require us to perform numerical simulations for each thermodynamic state of our system , defeating the purpose of adopting a coarse - grained model to reduce computational time .",

    "however , it includes the buildup of concentration fluctuations as the system approaches its spinodal decomposition .",
    "it is known that the detailed nature of single - phase blend correlations ( pair distribution functions ) is sensitive to system - specific factors such as liquid density , temperature , blend composition , and differences in effective unit size and local architectural details of the components . moreover ,",
    "many blends of practical relevance are characterized by strong asymmetries in local chemical semiflexibility and architecture .",
    "these effects influence local entropic packing of molecules and can lead to phase separation upon heating in a blend characterized by a lower critical solution temperature .",
    "our analytical expression describes the interaction betweeen c.o.m .  of a pair of polymers in a blend as a function of all the characteristic parameters that govern blend structure and dynamics .",
    "the derived mesoscale pair distribution functions effectively map the polymeric liquid onto a fluid of interacting soft - colloidal particles , thereby correctly reproducing fluctuations in number density and concentration , i.e. structure factors , and recovering the well - known equations for the compressibility and the dilation factor of colloidal mixtures.@xcite moreover , the theory agrees well , without fitting parameters , with data from ua - md computer simulations@xcite for polyolefin blends with different local stiffness , architecture , and blend composition .",
    "good agreement between the theory of mesoscopic colloidal particle mixtures and microscopic ua computer simulations of polymer blends supports the validity of our analytical renormalization procedure for polymer mixtures .",
    "the theory makes predictions on the evolution of the effective interpolymer potentials and chain packing as a function of temperature and blend composition , as well as polymer local structure , semiflexibility , and degree of polymerization .",
    "this paper is divided in the following way : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive monomer pair distribution functions for a binary asymmetric polymer blend where differences in bond length , degree of polymerization , and composition are explicitly taken into account .",

    "iii , we present a renormalized description of the polymer fluid by deriving c.o.m .  pair distribution functions . a brief discussion of the associated mean - force potential at chain - overlap is given in sec .",

    "vi we summarize model calculations for our renormalized description of a binary blend and make comparisons with simulation data .",
    "a brief discussion concludes the paper .",

    "the theory is then tested against data from ua - md simulations .",
    "we include the effect of microscopic and macroscopic parameters through a generalized form of the monomer - monomer pair distribution function , as derived from the thread limit in the polymer reference interaction site model ( prism ) liquid - state theory by curro , schweizer , and coworkers.@xcite the choice of the theory representing the monomer pair distribution function is arbitrary , and other analytical approaches could have been chosen as well.@xcite the original thread model is implemented here to include the dependence on asymmetries in semiflexibility following a somewhat different procedure than in the original work.@xcite no closure approximations are adopted in this derivation , and the miscibility parameter @xmath0 enters as an input to the theory , defining the proximity of the system to its demixing transition ( the spinodal temperature ) . in principle , this approach can describe systems with either lower ( lcst ) or upper ( ucst ) critical solution temperature .    in the thread model ,",

    "this approximated description of the local structure becomes correct in the limit of long polymer chains , where the fine structure of the distribution function does not appear .",
    "the thread model is the analog of the model investigated in field theory approaches .",
    "although analytically tractable , it has proven to be quite successful in describing properties of polymer melts , block copolymers , and blends.@xcite the main reason for its success is that it correctly captures the onset of  correlation hole \" effects@xcite in the monomer pair distribution functions at the lengthscale of the overall polymer size @xmath4 .",

    "in this section we present some predictions of our theoretical approach for the clustering and interpenetration of polymer chains in a blend as a function of chain length , semiflexibility , polymer volume fraction , and @xmath0 dependence by model calculations . in our model calculations , unless otherwise specified , @xmath212 , @xmath213 @xmath214 , and @xmath215  .",
    "these parameters have been chosen to be consistent with the ua - md simulations of polyolefin blends presented below .",

    "the _ majority _",
    "( high @xmath218 ) species increases the number of self - contacts , but still resembles in shape its athermal limit .",
    "this effect corresponds to the initial stage of droplet formation in the demixing of compositionally asymmetric mixtures . in general , the extent of demixing increases with increasing asymmetry in blend composition .    to investigate the effect of mismatch in chain flexibility , we analyze blends of polymers with identical degree of polymerization ( @xmath66 ) where component @xmath5 is flexible while the stiffness of component @xmath6 is increasing ( increasing @xmath155 and @xmath219 ) .",
    "the data from ua - md simulations analyzed subsequently in this paper ( see table ) belong to this group .",
    "in general , we observe that an increase in @xmath54 enhances the number of @xmath81 and @xmath79 contacts and reduces the number of @xmath80 contacts ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this effect is observed in both athermal and thermal mixtures .",
    "a stiff chain has a larger @xmath4 than a flexible molecule with the same degree of polymerization . in this case , the number of chains that can occupy the volume spanned by the stiff component increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , stiff chains pack better at short distances due to geometric effects ( stretched configurations enhance @xmath81 contacts ) , while flexible chains , which have a coiled configuration , tend to pack more efficiently at distances of order @xmath154 .",
    "overall , these two effects lead to an enhanced miscibility in mixtures of polymers with different flexibility and same degree of polymerization .    the potential of mean - force for chains of equal length is found to decrease with increasing degree of polymerization in agreement with computer simulations.@xcite the effect of mismatch in chain length for polymer species having the same semiflexibility is studied using a blend of polymers with @xmath220 fixed and @xmath221 , corresponding to @xmath222 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "analogous effects are observed in both the athermal and the thermal limits . in the athermal limit",
    ", the mismatch in chain size prevents the random mixing of the two components and  entropic \" effects appear .",
    "trivially , as the @xmath4 of the @xmath6 component increases the number of chains that can interpenetrate in the volume spanned by @xmath6 increases .",
    "this leads to a larger number of intermolecular contacts for all pair distribution functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath79 .",
    "this simple trend is combined with a more subtle behavior : a mismatch in chain length favors interpenetration between different species , so that the number of @xmath79 contacts is always higher than the number of @xmath80 and @xmath81 contacts except for chains of the same length .",
    "this property becomes more pronounced when the difference in chain length increases . also , short flexible chains tend to pack efficiently on the scale of their @xmath4 , while these effects are averaged out in large flexible chains , where  solvation shells \" do not appear ( a behavior analogous to the monomer distribution functions ) .",
    "our theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with off - lattice monte carlo simulations of polymer solutions.@xcite    to investigate in more detail these effects , we analyze polymer blends which have _ constant _ @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the change in chain length in the @xmath6 component is correlated with a change in semiflexibility .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 component is mixed with the component @xmath6 , which is both shorter and stiffer than @xmath5 ( @xmath223 and @xmath224 ) , or with a chain @xmath6 larger than @xmath5 but with comparable flexibility ( @xmath225 and @xmath226 ) . in analogy with our previous observation ,",
    "we see ( fig.6 ) that stiff chains tend to pack more efficiently than flexible ones at short distances , increasing in this way the number of @xmath81 and @xmath79 contacts . as a consequence",
    ", the number of @xmath80 contacts in a mixture of stiff @xmath6 chains is decreased with respect to the mixture of flexible polymers .",
    "close to the spinodal , flexible chains ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are in coiled configurations which tend to pack more efficiently at the distance of their @xmath4 .",
    "stiff chains , instead , tend to interpenetrate more efficiently and the number of @xmath81 contacts strongly increases in the mixture containing short and stiff @xmath6 chains .    next , we compare our analytical expressions against data from ua - md simulations of polymer blends described in the table.@xcite for each blend considered , the theory agrees with simulation data fairly well . however , we present here only few systems which are representative of our calculations .",
    "input parameters to the theory and the procedure used in the calculations were discussed in section ii .",
    "the c.o.m .",
    "total correlation function provides an estimate of the number of molecules interpenetrating at some relative distance @xmath69 . in all the plots ( fig.7 )",
    "we observe that chains of the stiffest component ( @xmath6 ) , which have extended configurations , tend to pack at short distances @xmath227 more efficiently than flexible ones .",
    "flexible molecules , which have coiled configurations , show a high ( low ) number of  intramolecular \" ( intermolecular ) contacts and pack most efficiently at distances on the order of the overall polymer size , @xmath228 .",
    "the extent of intermolecular chain packing upon blending also depends on polymer flexibility .",
    "the theory predicts that the stiff ( flexible ) component packs better ( worse ) , and the number of self contacts increases ( decreases ) when mixed with a more flexible ( stiffer ) polymer , in agreement with simulations.@xcite    in general , the agreement between theory and simulations is good with the exception of the pib / hhpp and pib / ipp blends for which agreement is only qualitative . for these systems",
    "the theory overestimates the number of intermolecular contacts .",
    "however , it is well known that pib blends are usually immiscible blends at these temperatures and for these chain lengths.@xcite pib exhibits very efficient intra- and intermolecular packing which leads to a thermal expansion coefficient and an isothermal compressibility smaller than in other polyolefin blends.@xcite this behavior is due to strong attractive interactions between the methyl ( @xmath229 ) groups , which in pib molecules are in very large number ( about 50% of the total number of united atoms).@xcite however , even for pib blends , the theory shows very good agreement with simulation data for @xmath230 .",
    "finally , in fig.8 we show how the theory can predict the correct qualitative behavior for blends following a lcst phase diagram . at high temperature",
    "the blend demixes and shows a distribution function for the @xmath79 component that is consistently lower than the @xmath80 and the @xmath81 contributions . at low temperature , instead",
    ", the mixing of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 species is enhanced with the @xmath79 function being always higher than its @xmath80 and @xmath81 counterparts .",
    "in this paper we present the first analytical solution for the center - of - mass total distribution functions for polymer mixtures . we start from first - principles liquid state theory and derive a set of equations which describe c.o.m . distribution functions between pairs of interacting molecules in the mixture .",
    "the mesoscale description of the liquid so obtained depends on local chemical parameters , such as the radius of gyration and bond length .",
    "moreover , mesoscale distribution functions depend on thermodynamic parameters such as density , blend composition , and proximity of the system to its spinodal decomposition .    the analytical c.o.m .",
    "total distribution functions quantitatively reproduce data from microscopic united - atom molecular dynamics simulations without the need of fitting parameters . in this comparison ,",
    "input to the theory are data from the ua - md simulations .",
    "the excellent agreement between analytical theory and simulations in both real and reciprocal space is an indication that our approach provides a reliable mesoscale description of polymer mixtures .",
    "moreover , our formalism recovers the known analytical functions for the fluctuations in number density and concentration ( structure factors ) for interacting soft - colloidal mixtures .",
    "the one - to - one agreement between the two formalisms supports the validity of our approach as a procedure to map polymer blends onto systems of interacting soft - colloidal particles .",
