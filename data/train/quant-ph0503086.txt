    "for many years a wide variety of physical systems have been described , often approximately , in terms of coupled two - state systems  @xcite . in more recent",
    "years application has been found in quantum information and quantum computing  @xcite , where such two - state systems have been used to describe a quantum mechanical version of the classical computer bit . this quantum bit , or ` qubit ' , is described as a linear superposition of two states ( say ` off ' and ` on ' ) , so that before a measurement the qubit is in some sense simultaneously both off and on , unlike a classical bit which is always either off or on .",
    "while two - state quantum systems are widely used , their utility suffers because there are only a limited number of known analytic solutions . for most two - state systems",
    "numerical calculations are required .",
    "although standard numerical methods are both fast and reliable for these simple systems , finding how the corresponding physical systems work is largely a numerical fishing trip in cloudy waters . analytic solutions , where they exist , are more transparent .",
    "one such solution that has received widespread applications in quantum optics  @xcite is obtained using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . in this approach , periodic transfer of the population within the system",
    "is achieved by applying an external field ( e.g. laser ) that is tuned to a narrow band of frequencies to match a particular transition between the system s levels .",
    "the result is well known rabi oscillations . in this paper",
    "we wish to call attention to another analytic solution for two - state quantum equations , namely the limit of sudden pulses .",
    "such a fast pulse is called a ` kick ' . unlike a periodic field with well defined carrier frequency used in the rwa technique ,",
    "a kick is localized in time and consists of a broad range of frequency components . due to their non - periodic structure ,",
    "kicks are well suited for applications that require occasional modifications of the system s state ( one kick - one transition ) .",
    "there are advantages in using kicks in systems where two states of interest lie close to one another in energy ( nearly degenerate systems ) . and ,",
    "of course , kicks would be a natural choice in cases where a pulsed source has to be used for one reason or another .",
    "fast pulses are an essential ingredient in the kicked rotor or standard map , a paradigm of the transition to chaos in one - dimensional time - dependent dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the kicked rotor was first realized in the laboratory by exposing ultracold sodium atoms to a periodic sequence of sharp pulses of near - resonant light  @xcite .",
    "signatures of classical and quantum chaotic behavior , including momentum diffusion , dynamical localization , and quantum resonances have all been observed in such atom optics experiments .",
    "intriguing connections have also been demonstrated between momentum localization in the quantum kicked rotor and anderson localization in disordered lattices  @xcite .",
    "the use of short pulses for the purpose of control of quantum systems was suggested previously for a variety of systems , including excitation of electronic states in molecules  @xcite , product formation in chemical reactions  @xcite , and quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "due to complexity of those systems , control pulses have to be carefully shaped to achieve effective control , and determination of such shapes often requires one to use either numerical techniques , or genetic algorithms .",
    "the response of quantum systems to fast pulses has also been studied extensively in the context of pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite . in this case , the pulse width is typically short compared with the time scales of the relaxation processes , including spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath1 and transverse relaxation time @xmath2 associated with line broadening .",
    "a single pulse may be used to study free induction decay ; more sophisticated multi - pulse sequences are used in spin echo experiments and in multi - dimensional fourier transform nmr  @xcite .",
    "techniques similar to ones discussed here are therefore developed to study the detailed evolution of a single spin or multiple spins , corresponding to multi - qubit systems , including spin precession and relaxation effects in the time intervals between pulses .",
    "quantum gates necessary for computation have been constructed using such pulse sequences  @xcite , and realized in experiments  @xcite . in some systems , discussed in this paper , one may take advantage of single or multiple external pulses of simple shape ( e.g. gaussian ) that contain many frequency components to reliably control quantum systems .",
    "there are other limits in which analytic solutions may be obtained , including perturbative and constant external interactions , and degenerate systems .",
    "however , these tend to be of limited use , as we discuss below .    in this paper",
    "we develop simple analytic solutions for singly and multiply kicked two - state quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "since the kicked limit is an ideal limit of pulses very sharp in time , we do numerical calculations for pulses of finite width to illustrate the region of validity for fast pulses .",
    "we do this for @xmath0 dipole transitions in hydrogen and illustrate the limits on the band width of the signals required to sensibly access such a region .",
    "part of our motivation for this study is to understand reaction dynamics  @xcite and coherent control  @xcite in the time domain .",
    "in particular we are interested in the study of observable effects of time ordering and also in understanding the related problem of time correlation  @xcite in few body dynamics  @xcite , corresponding to a system of a few dynamically coupled qubits .",
    "we use both analytic and numerical solutions to study effects of time ordering in multiply kicked systems . in a simple analytic example we illustrate the difference between time ordering and time reversal invariance .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper .",
    "a two - state quantum system may be described by a wave function , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the two basis states , e.g. on and off . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are complex probability amplitudes restricted by the normalization condition , @xmath8 .",
    "the basis states @xmath5 and @xmath4 are eigenstates of an unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath9 , given here by , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy difference of the eigenstates of @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is a pauli spin matrix . the average energy of ` on ' and ` off ' states of the unperturbed system may always be taken as zero since a shift in overall energy of the system corresponds to an unphysical overall phase in the wavefunction .",
    "probability amplitudes evolve as @xmath13 , and the occupation probabilities of the basis states , @xmath14 , remain constant in time .",
    "the states of a qubit can be coupled via an external interaction @xmath15 , so that the occupation probabilities change in time . for simplicity , we assume that the interaction has the following form : @xmath16 i.e. all of the time dependence in the interaction operator @xmath15 is contained in a single real function of @xmath17 and the interaction does not contain a term proportional to @xmath9 . without loss of generality , in this section",
    "we only consider interactions that include terms proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "these assumptions are often justifiable on experimental grounds  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system then becomes , @xmath19 and the probability amplitudes evolve according to @xmath20    formal solution to ( [ eqmo ] ) may be written in terms of the time evolution operator @xmath21 as @xmath22 in general , solving ( [ eqmo ] ) and ( [ amps ] ) requires use of numerical methods .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath21 may be expressed here as @xmath23 the only non - trivial time dependence in @xmath21 arises from time dependent @xmath24 and time ordering @xmath25 .",
    "the dyson time ordering operator @xmath25 specifies that @xmath26 is properly ordered : @xmath27 .\\ ] ] time ordering imposes a connection between the effects of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and leads to observable time ordering effects  @xcite . since time ordering effects can be defined as the difference between a result with time ordering and the corresponding result in the limit of no time ordering , it is useful to specify carefully the limit without time ordering . removing time ordering corresponds to replacing @xmath30 in ( [ u ] ) .      in this paper",
    "we emphasize the utility of having analytic solutions , i.e. as compared to less transparent solutions obtained numerically .",
    "unfortunately there are a limited number of conditions under which analytic solutions may be obtained . in order of increasing complexity",
    "these include :    1 .",
    "perturbative interactions  @xcite . here",
    "the interaction @xmath31 is sufficiently weak that the system largely remains in its initial state .",
    "the solution of ( [ eqmo ] ) is trivial : @xmath32 the mathematical validity condition is that the action associated with the external field is small , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   degenerate basis states  @xcite . in this case",
    "the energy levels of the two unperturbed states are nearly the same . for two - state systems",
    "the occupation probabilities are typically @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "remarkably this form holds for both slowly and rapidly changing fields .",
    "validity requires that the action difference associated with free propagation of the two unperturbed states be small , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   constant external fields . here",
    "the interaction @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "the analytic solution , found from that for slowly changing fields given immediately below , is mathematically similar to the physically distinct rwa solution  @xcite .",
    "4 .   slowly changing ( adiabatic ) fields  @xcite .",
    "the analytic solution of ( [ eqmo ] ) is , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the validity condition @xmath40 is sometimes difficult to achieve .",
    "rwa solutions .",
    "@xmath31 oscillates with a frequency @xmath41 close to the resonant frequency of the transition between the basis states , @xmath42 .",
    "the rwa expression for @xmath43 is the same as the expression for slowly changing fields given immediately above , except that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the rwa is valid  @xcite when the frequency of the external field , @xmath41 , is nearly the same as that of the transition frequency , @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "6 .   a sudden pulse  @xcite or series of sudden pulses ( single or multiple kicks ) .",
    "the basic validity condition  @xcite is that the external field is sharply tuned in time , i.e. @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the width of the pulse .",
    "this condition is met when @xmath49 is relatively small .",
    "we examine this in detail below . in many experimentally accessible cases",
    "one can build an external field using a combination of kicks .",
    "these solutions represent different scenarios , some of which can lead to a significant or even complete transfer of the population between basis states of the qubit . the scenarios that allow complete transfer of the population are especially interesting for possible applications in the field of quantum information .",
    "any measurement of a superposition state of the qubit leads to the collapse of the wavefunction and results in finding a qubit in one of its basis states .",
    "therefore , the only states of a qubit for which one can predict the outcome of the measurement are the basis states themselves .",
    "consequently , one needs a reliable way to drive the system into one of these states . also , to form an arbitrary superposition state , one should be able to transfer any fraction of the population of the system into any of the states .",
    "this can not be achieved with the perturbative scenario , for which the transfer of population is always incomplete , and some superposition states can never be formed .    in the stationary or adiabatically changing field scenario , completeness of the transfer",
    "is limited by the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "transfer is incomplete unless the energy levels are degenerate .",
    "in rwa , the probability amplitudes oscillate  @xcite with the rabi frequency @xmath51 , and completeness of the transfer can be adjusted by changing the detuning parameter , @xmath52 . again , only in the limit of exact resonance , @xmath53 , is the transfer complete .",
    "another technique , which is based on rwa and , when applicable , enables one to achieve almost complete transfer of the population , is stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage  @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "a counter intuitive sequence of a pump pulse and a stokes pulse is used to transfer the population via an intermediate state without losing any population due to the spontaneous decay of that state .",
    "this technique has proven to be very effective in a number of systems .",
    "the limiting factors there , however , are : i ) it can not be applied to degenerate or nearly degenerate systems , and ii ) the pulses have to be applied adiabatically , which prevents one from using fast and ultrafast pulses ( typical duration of pulses used in stirap is of the order of a nanosecond , whereas in the kick approach , the only restriction comes from the structure of the energy levels of the system , so picosecond and , in some cases , even femtosecond pulses can be used ) . in degenerate qubits ,",
    "even higher degree of controllability can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "and in some systems , a natural way to achieve a complete transfer of the population in a qubit is to apply a sudden pulse , or a kick .",
    "the focus of this paper therefore is on suddenly changing pulses , i.e. kicks , where population transfer can in some cases be complete .",
    "kicks are an ideal limit of finite pulses , or sequence of pulses , each of some finite duration @xmath49 .",
    "each kick causes sudden changes in the populations of the two states .",
    "it is instructive to define phase angles for each individual pulse , namely , @xmath54 the angle @xmath55 is a measure of the strength of the interaction @xmath31 over the duration of a given pulse .",
    "the angle @xmath56 is a measure of the influence of @xmath9 during the interaction interval @xmath49 .",
    "exact analytical solutions can be obtained in the limit of kicks when the pulse applied at the time @xmath57 becomes a @xmath58-function , @xmath59 , since the integration over time in ( [ u ] ) becomes trivial . for a more realistic case where the pulse has a finite width , one may , at best , only obtain an approximate solution .",
    "in this section we consider single and multiple kicks , where @xmath31 may be described in terms of delta functions in time , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "we work primarily in the interaction representation , since the solutions are relatively simple and there are generally advantages with convergence in the interaction representation  @xcite . in the interaction representation",
    "the evolution operator has the general form @xmath61 it s straightforward ( e.g. using power series expansions ) to show that @xmath62 introducing a unit vector @xmath63 , ( [ ui ] ) can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .    as mentioned above",
    "there are relatively few cases in which analytic solutions are available .",
    "considered next is one set of such cases , namely singly and multiply kicked qubits .",
    "the basic building block is a two - state system subject to a single kick at time @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "the integration over time is trivial and the time evolution operator in ( [ ui1 ] ) becomes @xmath68   = \\pmatrix{\\cos\\alpha_k & -\\rmi\\sin\\alpha_k \\rme^{-\\rmi \\delta e t_k } \\cr -\\rmi\\sin\\alpha_k   \\rme^{\\rmi \\delta e t_k } & \\cos\\alpha_k}\\ ] ] for @xmath69 .",
    "here we used the identity @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is an arbitrary unit vector . note that @xmath72 is independent of @xmath17 since the @xmath73 factors , due to free propagation ,",
    "are transferred from the evolution operator to the wavefunction in the interaction representation .",
    "another way to evaluate @xmath72 is to use @xmath74 from the schrdinger representation and to use the general relation , @xmath75 . for a single kick",
    "@xmath76 has been previously evaluated  @xcite , namely , @xmath77 there is an explicit dependence on time in @xmath74 . even in this elementary example",
    "the expression for the time evolution matrix , @xmath43 , is simpler in the interaction representation than in the schrdinger representation .    for a kicked qubit initially found in the state @xmath5 , the occupation probabilities are simply , @xmath78    when the pulse width is finite",
    ", the corrections to ( [ pk1 ] ) are @xmath79 .",
    "these corrections result from the commutator of the free hamiltonian @xmath9 with the interaction @xmath80 during the time @xmath49 when the pulse is active .",
    "for example , in the case of a rectangular pulse of width @xmath49 , the exact time evolution is given  @xcite by @xmath81 where @xmath82 . to leading order in @xmath56 , i.e. in the width of the pulse ,",
    "the error in the kicked approximation is given by @xmath83 in the schrdinger picture , time ordering effects are present even for a single ideal kick , specifically the time ordering between the interaction and the free evolution preceding and following the kick  @xcite .",
    "the time ordering effect vanishes in either the degenerate limit @xmath84 or in the perturbative limit @xmath85 .    in the interaction picture , time ordering effects disappear for a single ideal kick .",
    "this is easily understood by considering that in the interaction picture , time ordering is only between interactions at different times , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , not between the interaction @xmath88 and the free hamiltonian @xmath89 , as in the schrdinger case . for a single ideal kick ,",
    "all the interaction occurs at one instant , and no ordering is needed .",
    "of course , for a finite - width pulse , i.e. @xmath90 , time - ordering effects do begin to appear even in the interaction picture  @xcite .",
    "we note that the time ordering effect in the interaction picture is independent of the measurement time @xmath17 , though it does depend on the pulse width @xmath49 through the @xmath56 parameter .",
    "consider now a series of kicks , @xmath91 , applied at @xmath92 with @xmath93 , i.e. a potential of the form @xmath94 .",
    "in the interaction representation , this potential has the form : @xmath95 the evolution operator ( [ ui1 ] ) becomes @xmath96 for a given order of pulses , the ( [ umk ] ) can be written as @xmath97 \\times ... \\times \\exp [ -\\rmi\\alpha_1\\vec{n}(t_1 ) \\ !",
    "\\vec{\\sigma } ] \\ , \\nonumber\\ ] ] which is a simple product of time evolution operators for single kicks . using ( [ usk ] ) , one obtains : @xmath98 this can be evaluated for an arbitrary combination of kicks , so the analytical expression for the final occupational probabilities for the basis states can be obtained . as we shall explicitly demonstrate later , the order in which the kicks occur can make an observable difference .",
    "the simplest example of a series of arbitrary kicks is a sequence of two kicks , of strengths @xmath99 and @xmath100 , applied at times @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "then ( [ umk0f ] ) is easily solved , namely , @xmath103 \\exp [ -\\rmi\\alpha_1\\vec{n}(t_1 ) \\vec{\\sigma } ]   \\nonumber   \\\\    & = & \\pmatrix { u_{11 } & -u_{21}^ * \\cr u_{21 }   & u_{11}^ * } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 here @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . in the limit @xmath107 , ( [ u2 ] )",
    "reduces to ( [ usk ] ) with @xmath108 .",
    "note that @xmath109 \\neq 0 $ ] so that the time ordering of the interactions is important . in the interaction representation",
    "the expression for the matrix elements of @xmath43 and the corresponding probability amplitudes are a little simpler than the corresponding , physically equivalent , expressions in the schrdinger representation , which include an unnecessary explicit dependence on time .",
    "this reflects the idea that the interaction representation takes advantage of the known eigensolutions of @xmath9 .",
    "the algebra for doing a combination of two arbitrary kicks , one proportional to @xmath110 and the other proportional to @xmath18 , is very similar to that for two arbitrary kicks proportional to @xmath18 . for a single @xmath110 kick , similarly to ( [ usk ] ) one quickly finds @xmath111 .    then using @xmath112",
    ", one finds that the matrix elements for a @xmath110 kick at @xmath101 followed by a @xmath18 kick at @xmath102 are , @xmath113 from that , the transition probability to the off state is , @xmath114 if the @xmath18 and @xmath110 kicks are reversed , then @xmath115 so that @xmath116 .",
    "this difference oscillates between @xmath117 when @xmath118 .",

    "now the difference between the effects of two sequences is obvious .      in this subsection",
    "we use our analytic expressions to examine the effect of the dyson time ordering operator , @xmath25 , in a kicked two - state system .",
    "the effect of time ordering has been considered previously in the context of atomic collisions with charged particles @xcite and differs somewhat from the order in which external pulses are applied , as illustrated below . as is intuitively evident , there is no time ordering in a singly kicked qubit  @xcite since there is only one kick . the simplest kicked two - state system that shows an effect due to time ordering is the qubit kicked by two equal and opposite pulses separated by a time @xmath105 .",
    "the evolution matrix @xmath170 for this system of ( [ uka0 ] ) may be rewritten for convenience ( as may be easily verified ) as , @xmath171 the limit of no time ordering , i.e. @xmath30 in ( [ ui ] ) , may in principle be generally obtained  @xcite by replacing @xmath172 with @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is an average ( constant ) value of the interaction . in the case of two kicks of the same magnitude and opposite signs , it is then straightforward to show that , @xmath175 in this example we now have analytic expressions for the matrix elements of both @xmath170 that contains time ordering and @xmath176 that does not include time ordering .",
    "let us now pause to examine the difference between time ordering and time reversal in this simple , illustrative example .",
    "reversal of time ordering means that , since @xmath129 and @xmath66 are both reversed , both @xmath115 and @xmath177 . in this case",
    "one sees from the equations above that @xmath170 is not invariant , i.e. phase changes occur , while @xmath178 remains the same .",
    "thus @xmath170 changes when the time ordering is changed , but @xmath178 does not change . for time reversal  @xcite @xmath179 and , since the initial and final states are also interchanged , @xmath180 . in this case",
    "one sees by inspection of the above equations that both @xmath170 and @xmath178 are invariant under time reversal , as expected . as shown below when the symmetry of the kicks is broken the difference between @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    "can be observed .",
    "we have shown above both algebraically and numerically that for two kicks proportional to @xmath18 , the order of the kicks does not change the final population transfer probability @xmath162 .",
    "however , interestingly , this does not mean that there is no effect due to time ordering in this case . as we show next",
    ", there is an effect due to time ordering in this case , even though reversing the order of the kicks has no effect .",
    "the effect of time ordering on the occupation probabilities may be examined by considering the probability of transfer of population from the on state to the off state with and without time ordering , namely ,    @xmath183    where @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "difference in population transfer probability , @xmath186 vs. @xmath184 and @xmath185 . here",
    "@xmath105 is the time between the pulses and @xmath187 is a measure of the interaction strength .",
    "the two - state system is kicked by a sharp pulse of strength @xmath55 at time @xmath101 and by an equal and opposite pulse at time @xmath102 .",
    "the difference , @xmath186 , is due to time ordering in this qubit . ]",
    "the effect of time ordering is shown in figure [ f7 ] , where @xmath186 is plotted as a function of @xmath185 , corresponding to the strength of the kicks , and @xmath184 , which varies with the time separation of the two kicks .",
    "the effect of time ordering disappears in the example we present here in the limit that either the interaction strength or the time separation of the pulses goes to zero . for small , but finite , values of both the interaction strength and the time separation of the pulses , the effect of time",
    "ordering is to reduce the probability of transition from the initially occupied state to an initially unoccupied state .",
    "that is , in this regime time ordering reduces the maximum transfer of population from one state to another .",
    "as either of these two parameters gets sufficiently large , the effect of time ordering oscillates with increasing values of the interaction strength or the separation time between the two pulses .",
    "time ordering effects are present even though @xmath188 .",
    "clearly one may extend this approach past two kicks or three .",
    "since arbitrary pulses can be built from a series of kicks , in principle one may build arbitrarily complex pulses using kicks .",
    "while adding more kicks is straightforward , the algebra becomes more difficult .",
    "also , the number of natural systems in which the validity conditions apply diminishes as the pulse becomes more complex .",
    "hence it may be sensible to seek cases that have sufficient symmetry so the analysis is both simple and applicable .",
    "it has been previously noted  @xcite , for example , that a simple expression , corresponding to floquet states , exists for a periodic series of narrow pulses .",
    "part of the motivation for this paper grew out of an effort to define correlation in time  @xcite , based on effects of time ordering .",
    "while in principle we have found no fundamental problem with this effort , we have found that it is often difficult to find expressions for the time evolution matrix in the limit of no time ordering , namely @xmath189 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath189 can depend on the representation used  @xcite .",
    "we also note that time ordering may occur in the degenerate limit , e.g. when @xmath190 . in recent applications in collision dynamics using perturbation theory  @xcite ,",
    "time ordering is removed by use of degenerate states since the external interactions do not contain more than one type of coupling .",
    "but in these calculations there is no difference between time ordering and time correlation .",
    "the most reliable way to remove time ordering is replacement  @xcite of the instantaneous interaction @xmath31 by its time averaged value , @xmath191 .",
    "3em in summary , analytic solutions for two - state systems ( e.g. qubits ) strongly perturbed by a series of rapidly changing pulses , called ` kicks ' , have been developed and discussed .",
    "such analytic solutions provide useful physical insight , which together with more complete numerical methods  @xcite may be used to solve more complex problems . for a series of kicks",
    "the evolution matrix may be expressed as a time ordered product of single kicks .",
    "we have explicitly considered in detail single , double , and triple kicks .",
    "while there is no difference in the population transition probability if two @xmath18 kicks are interchanged , time ordering does have an observable effect .",
    "the effect happens to be the same for both of these orderings .",
    "if a @xmath18 kick is interchanged with a @xmath110 kick in a doubly kicked system , the difference can be observed in most cases .",
    "if three @xmath18 kicks are used , different orderings can also be observably different .",
    "the effect of using pulses of finite widths has been studied numerically for @xmath161 transitions in atomic hydrogen .",
    "if the pulse width is much smaller than the rabi time of the active states , then the analytic kicked solutions are valid .",
    "such pulses can be created experimentally using existing microwave sources .",
    "the difference between time ordering and time reversal has been specified .",
    "time ordering can have observable effects . under time reversal",
    "the quantum amplitudes are generally invariant .",
    "our results may be extended to an arbitrary number of kicks . however , without simplifying symmetries , the solutions become more complex , and the applicability of this approach becomes more limited , as the number of kicks increases .",
    "here we discuss some details concerning the use of the two - state approach for studying the @xmath150  @xmath144 transition in hydrogen .",
    "first , we note that the eight @xmath192 states ( two @xmath193 states , two @xmath145 states , and four @xmath146 states ) are nearly degenerate and well separated in energy from states with @xmath194 .",
    "thus , smooth external pulses may easily be chosen long enough to prevent field - induced population transfer out of the @xmath192 subspace , and requiring us only to include the spontaneous decay rate @xmath195 from @xmath144 to @xmath196 .",
    "furthermore , rotational invariance around the axis of the external electric field @xmath197 leads to conservation of total angular momentum component along that direction , allowing a given @xmath193 state to couple only to one @xmath145 state and one @xmath146 state . specifically , starting with an initial @xmath193 state with spin polarization at some angle @xmath198 relative to @xmath197 , the accessible subspace is spanned by the three basis vectors @xmath199 where the initial spin state is @xmath200 , and both orbital angular momentum and spin components are measured along the direction of @xmath197 .    since the external pulse does not change the orbital angular momentum component @xmath201 , the external field couples only the two states @xmath202 and @xmath203 in the above basis , e.g. @xmath204 for a @xmath18 pulse .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath9 is diagonal in the basis of good total angular momentum @xmath205 . in the basis of ( [ appbasis ] ) , @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the fine structure splitting , and we take the decay rate @xmath195 to be the same for @xmath145 and @xmath146 .    for narrow pulses ,",
    "whose inverse width @xmath153 is large compared both with the splitting @xmath208 between the @xmath193 and @xmath145 energies ( lamb shift ) and also @xmath209 ( fine structure ) , the free propagation may be neglected during the time of the pulse .",
    "then the full propagator in the interaction representation may be written as a product of kick operators of the form @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the time of the @xmath212 kick .",
    "now @xmath213 is block - diagonal by construction ( [ appv ] ) , with the @xmath214 state decoupled . in between pulses , amplitude oscillates between the @xmath144 and @xmath214 states with period @xmath147 .",
    "however , if we now choose all inter - pulse spacings to be integer multiples of this period , @xmath215 then the free propagation between kicks also becomes diagonal : @xmath216 as may easily be checked explicitly by writing the above free propagator in the @xmath145 , @xmath146 basis and noting that the two basis vectors acquire the same phase @xmath217 .",
    "thus the @xmath214 state decouples entirely and its occupation probability will always be zero when we view the dynamics stroboscopically with period @xmath149 starting with the time @xmath101 of the first kick .",
    "the three - state dynamics therefore reduces to two - state dynamics in the @xmath150 , @xmath144 subspace .    finally ,",
    "as long the the inter - kick spacings are all integer multiples of @xmath149 , we may also use the two - state formulas presented in the main body of the paper to evaluate the occupation probabilities at an arbitrary time between kicks or after the last kick .",
    "we need only remember that the @xmath144 probability that we compute at these arbitrary times is the total probability for being in either the @xmath144 and @xmath214 state , or equivalently the total probability for being in either the @xmath145 or @xmath146 state .",
