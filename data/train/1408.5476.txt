    "rave ( radial velocity experiment ) is a digital spectroscopic survey of stars in the nominal magnitude interval @xmath16 , distributed over the whole southern sky .",
    "spectra have been recorded over the 8400 - 8800  range , at an average resolving power @xmath176500 , with the aao ( australian astronomical observatory ) uk  schmidt telescope feeding light to a spectrograph via the 6-degree field ( 6df ) 150 fiber positioner .",
    "the primary science driver of the survey is the investigation of the structure and evolution of the milky way through the determination of radial velocities , chemistries , temperatures , and gravities for a large number of stars .",
    "the survey data releases @xcite have followed an incremental scheme , with the last data release n.4 ( dr4 * ? ? ?",

    "rave data have so far directly supported about fifty refereed papers .",
    "accurate photometry , based on bands spanning the optical and near infrared wavelength ranges , is an essential support to spectroscopic surveys like rave .",
    "such photometry provides , among other things : ( @xmath18 ) the brightness distribution functions of the survey targets , ( @xmath19 ) the effective temperature , useful _ per se _ or as a prior to the spectroscopic determination of atmospheric parameters , ( @xmath20 ) the reddening , ( @xmath21 ) the observed brightness against which to derive the distance modulus ( @xmath22 ) to the survey targets , ( @xmath23 ) the color discriminant to segregate single normal stars from binaries and peculiar stars , and ( @xmath24 ) when multi - epoch photometry is available , information on the target intrinsic variability .",
    "so far , only limited photometric information in the optical has been available for rave stars , as reviewed below .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide accurate multi - band optical photometry for all rave stars and to combine it with near - ir 2mass photometry .",
    "a total of 251626 rave dr4 stars have a match in the tycho-2 @xmath25,@xmath26 catalog .",
    "unfortunately , the tycho-2 photometric errors rapidly degrade toward the faint survey limit , and over the range of brightness of the bulk of rave stars , tycho-2 data ( especially the @xmath25 band ) are virtually useless .",
    "the median value of quoted tycho-2 errors for rave stars is @xmath27 and @xmath28  mag , for a combined @xmath29 which is far larger than the reddening affecting the majority of rave stars , or larger than the color spread corresponding to the combined uncertainty in the rave atmospheric parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath30 , [ m / h ] )",

    "denis @xmath5 and @xmath7 photometry is of limited precision , the median value on rave stars being @xmath32=0.07 and @xmath33=0.07 mag ( three times worst that corresponding 2mass values ) , with @xmath34 on the combined color index ( @xmath35 for 2mass ) .",
    "such an uncertainty on the color index corresponds to an uncertainty of 15% in the effective temperature of a red giant star or 0.20 mag in @xmath10 , spoiling denis @xmath5,@xmath7 photometry of any practical value in supporting rave survey .",
    "denis @xmath31 photometry , even if reported to a greater precision ( a median of @xmath36  mag on rave stars ) , is affected by saturation problems for bright rave targets , setting in at undocumented different levels of brightness depending on the location on the sky ( cf .",
    "furthermore , the transmission profile of denis @xmath31 band is not accurately known , and thus the observed complex offset from landolt s and cousins standard stars can not be safely compensated for during modeling and analysis of the data .    ,",

    "the final carlsberg meridian circle data release , cmc-15 of 2013 , contains counterparts to 228805 rave dr4 stars .",
    "the original cmc observations did not include a second photometric band , necessary for the transformation from the local to the standard system , which was achieved by importing in the process the bluer color ( @xmath38 ) from tycho-2 catalog .",

    "figure  1 ) , which provides only a limited leverage in term of diagnostic capability .",
    "in fact , the 10@xmath4090 percentile interval in the color distribution of rave stars corresponds to just @xmath41  mag .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide accurate photometry for all rave dr4 stars in the landolt @xmath0,@xmath1 and sloan @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 photometric bands , as obtained during the apass survey ( aavso photometric all - sky survey ; * ? ? ?",

    "combining with 2mass @xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 data in the infrared , apass photometric bands encompass the majority of the energy distribution of typical rave stars , as shown schematically in figure  1 .",
    "the plan of this paper is first to present the apass data on rave stars and test their photometric and astrometric quality .",
    "photometric degeneracy between temperature and reddening is then discussed , and a simple model for galactic extinction is introduced and its parameters calibrated against apass+2mass data for standard stars .",
    "photometric temperatures are derived , first for a set of standard stars to assess their accuracy , and then for the whole body of rave stars .",
    "these photometric temperatures are compared with those derived spectroscopically , and the result discussed .",
    "finally , the @xmath10 reddening is derived for all rave dr4 stars both from unconstrained fit as well as fixing the atmospheric parameters to the values derived by rave spectra .    among the goals of future papers in this series , there will be the derivation of a galactic 3d map for the interstellar @xmath10 reddening here derived for rave dr4 stars , the photometric characterization of rave dr4 peculiar stars , the study of the photometric variability of rave dr4 peculiar stars by accessing the individual epoch photometric data , the use of supplementary observations in the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 filters , and extension to brighter magnitudes than the current apass saturation limits .",

    "apass results are already used as the photometric source catalog for the us naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac-4 ) , and for the harvard college dasch program ( which is scanning the harvard plate stacks and measuring the magnitude of all detected stars ) .",
    "the apass photometric survey covers the whole sky , from pole to pole , with ongoing observations from ctio ( chile ) , for the southern hemisphere , and new mexico for the northern counterpart . at both sites ,",
    "a pair of twin remotely controlled , small telescopes obtain simultaneous ccd observations during dark- and grey - moon time over five optical bands : @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( tied to the equatorial standards of * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 bands ( tied to the 158 primary standards given by @xcite , that define the sloan photometric system ) .",
    "the telescopes are 20-cm f/3.6 astrographs feeding apogee u16 m cameras ( 4@xmath49 array , 9  @xmath50 m pixels ) , that cover a field 2.9  deg wide with a 2.6  arcsec / pix plate factor .",
    "the photometric filters are of the dielectric multi - layer type and are produced by astrodon .",
    "transmission curves and photometric performances of astrodon filters are discussed and compared to more conventional types of photometric filters in @xcite and @xcite . on average 80 fields",
    "are observed per night at each apass location , 20 of them being standard fields ( landolt , sloan ) well distributed in time and airmass .",
    "the apass observations are obtained with fixed exposure times ( different and optimized for each photometric band ) , set to detect @xmath1=17 stars at s / n=5 on a single exposure .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath1=10 may saturate under optimal seeing conditions .",
    "apass has also recently begun using the bright - moon periods to obtain shorter exposure observations in order to push the saturation limit upward to 7.5 mag stars , and to observe also in the @xmath44 band at 1.035 @xmath50 m ( defined by * ? ? ?",

    "the astrometric matching to the apass catalog has been performed by taking position and proper motions of rave stars as listed in dr4 and projecting them to the 2013 apass epoch .",
    "the matching radius has been set to 3.0 arcsec .",
    "all 425743 rave dr4 stars turned out to have their apass counterpart .",
    "as a test on the accuracy of apass astrometry ( which is calibrated against ucac-4 ) , we have searched the final cmc-15 release ( 2013 ) of the carlsberg meridian catalog for the positions of rave stars and computed the separation between the apass and carlsberg positions ( equinox j2000 , individual epochs varying from 1999 to 2005 ) .",
    "their distribution is presented in figure  2 .",
    "it has its peak at a separation of 0.072 arcsec and the median at 0.098 arcsec , confirming the high astrometric accuracy of apass products .",
    "each apass observing night is independently calibrated in all - sky mode against the landolt and sloan standards observed that same night over a large range of airmass .",
    "the photometric quality of a given night can be evaluated only _ a posteriori _ during the data reduction process , and only data obtained during photometric nights are used to build the apass catalog .",
    "the difference in magnitude for data on the same stars obtained in separate nights ( usually months apart ) , is therefore a reliable estimate of the _ total _ internal errors affecting apass photometry .",
    "their distribution for rave stars is presented in figure  3 , and the distribution of rave stars as function of the number of epoch apass observations is given in figure  4 ( on average , a rave star has been observed on 4 independent epochs by apass , and none at less than 2 epochs ) .",
    "the errors corresponding to the tails of the distributions in figure  3 are actually an over - estimate of the true internal photometric errors .",
    "in fact , in building figure  3 all stars are treated as non - variable , but as shown by the hipparcos satellite about 10% of all stars it observed did show a variability of at least 0.01 mag amplitude .",
    "median values of the error distributions in fig .  3 , and the corresponding 2mass values are : @xmath51 where the larger value for the @xmath4 band ( compared to @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ) is mainly due to the variable intensity of the strong telluric absorptions present over its pass - band .",

    "saturated stars from top panels are not plotted on lower panels.[fig6],width=283 ]      a necessary test is to evaluate at what magnitude saturation sets in ( because of the fixed exposure time over the whole sky ) , and therefore to place a safe upper brightness limit to the use of apass data to model properties of rave stars .",
    "the test is carried out in figure  5 , where the tabular value of 245 landolt primary standards is compared to that derived by apass ( which obviously uses only non - saturated landolt standards to perform its calibration ) .",
    "note that apass uses the same 14-arcsec diameter digital aperture that matched the landolt 14-arcsec photoelectric photometer aperture , so any neighboring star included in landolt s aperture is also included in the apass photometry .",
    "figure  5 shows that most of the @xmath0,@xmath1 observations are unsaturated up to 9.5 mag , but excellent seeing can cause this limit to shift down to 10.0 mag .",
    "a similar exercise for sloan 158 primary standards shows that @xmath4 band is unsaturated up to 9.0 mag , the @xmath3 band up to 9.5 mag , while the limit for the @xmath2 band is 10.0 mag .",
    "these results perfectly match those independently derived , from a different and independent set of apass data , during the search for and the characterization of rr lyr variables potentially associated with the aquarius stream @xcite , a galactic stream originating from a disrupting globular cluster that was first identified on rave data @xcite .",
    "to have a safe margin in all bands and for all stars , we will limit the analysis in the rest of this paper to stars with an apass magnitude @xmath53 in the @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 bands and @xmath54 in @xmath4 ( only 1.8% of the total number of rave dr4 stars is consequently ignored in the following ) . as mentioned in the introduction , apass is currently using the bright moon nights to perform a shallower parallel survey aiming to push the saturation limit up to 7.5 mag stars .",
    "the apass data for the brighter rave stars will be investigated when ready , thus later in this series of papers .",

    "we compare apass data to available literature .",
    "we begin with photometric standard stars not used in the calibration of apass data ( to avoid circular arguments ) , and then move to consider field and cluster stars .",
    "@xcite have calibrated a series of secondary landolt standards in 81 low galactic latitude fields .",
    "these secondary standards are _ not _ used to calibrate apass data , which relies only on the primary landolt equatorial standards . the comparison with henden and munari secondary standards",
    "is carried out in figure  6 .",
    "it shows no offsets or trends with apass @xmath0 , @xmath1 photometry , and confirms 10.0 mag as the saturation limit for the survey .",
    "the rms of apass data on these secondary standards is somewhat larger than on the landolt primary standards used for the photometric calibration .",
    "a reason is the large crowding affecting the low galactic fields where the henden & munari secondary standards are located , while landolt standards are primarely high galactic latitude stars well isolated from neighbours .",
    "in addition to the primary 158 photometric standards for the sloan system , @xcite also published a list of additional 2988 secondary standards .",
    "these sloan secondary standards are _ not _ used in the apass calibration , so they constitute an unbiased external consistency check for apass photometry .",
    "the comparison is carried out in figure  7 , and it shows again no offset and no trend .",
    "the larger scatter is most likely due to the larger 24-arcsec digital aperture used by smith et al .",
    "their 158 primary standards were mostly also landolt standards with no nearby neighbors , but the 2988 secondary standards may not have been so carefully selected .    while there are no large sets of stars in the rave brightness range that were measured by different authors in the @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 sloan bands , the johnson @xmath0,@xmath1 bands have extensive coverage",
    ". a relevant source of data is the _ catalog of mean ubv data _",
    "( cat - ubv for short ) , critically assembled from existing literature by @xcite during the work leading to the compilation of the hipparcos input catalog .",
    "it covers 103108 stars with @xmath55 measurements spread over 693 different source papers ( 27803 stars rely on only one observation from only one source ) .",
    "figure  8 presents the comparison for the 723 field stars fainter than 10.0 mag in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are in common between cat - ubv and apass , and for which cat - ubv averages over at least two distinct data sources .",
    "figure  9 presents a similar comparison for 1073 stars that are members of clusters .",
    "what is relevant in these two figures is the absence of offsets and trends in both the magnitude zero - points and their color dependences .",
    "the outliers in both figures are almost entirely stars with only one observation from just two independent sources .",
    "the rms values in figures  8 and 9 are somewhat larger than for the comparisons carried out in figures  5 - 7 .",
    "there are various possible causes for this , such as ( @xmath56 ) the presence of unrecognized low - amplitude variable stars , ( @xmath57 ) the mainly photoelectric origin of cat - ubv data ( in photoelectric photometry all the light entering the generously large aperture of the photometer - usually tens of arcsec - is measured , thus the target together with faint field stars ; while in ccd photometry the stars are isolated from the background and measured individually . perhaps not incidentally , data for members of open cluster appear more dispersed in figure  9 than data for field stars in figure  8) , and ( @xmath58 ) the many different variants over which independent authors - whose data were entered into cat - ubv - tried to replicate the johnson s @xmath59 bands , landolt s @xmath59 bands being just one of such variants ( a comprehensive discussion of the realisation of the johnson s system and the difficulties of reproducing it with instrumentation that changed with time , is given for example in bessell ( 1990 ) , in the books by @xcite and @xcite , and the two volumes of the asiago database on photometric systems by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the cmc-15 and apass @xmath3 magnitudes for the 228805 rave dr4 stars in common is presented in figure  10 .",
    "there is no trend with color , a minor systematic offset of just 0.009 mag , and a tight concentration of points with the quartile of the distribution amounting to only 0.018 mag .",

    "this led to grouping the targets in the rave input catalog over four distinct ranges in @xmath31-band magnitude ( nominally @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the corresponding tailing of the actual observations is apparent in the segmented distribution affecting the @xmath4 panel of figure  13 .",
    "the presence of segmentation in other bands declines with increasing wavelength separation from the @xmath4 band .",
    "it is noteworthy that the distribution in @xmath0 band is closely matched by a gaussian ( overplotted ) centered on @xmath67 and with @xmath68  mag .",
    "the distribution of rave stars over the hr diagram is shown in figure 12 , and is dominated by closer , hotter and higher galactic latitude main sequence / turn - off stars ( the cloud of points centered at @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , and by more distant , cooler and lower galactic latitude rgb and red clump stars ( the cloud of points centered at @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "to extract information about the observed stars , we performed a @xmath8 fit of apass+2mass photometry against a library of purposefully - built synthetic photometry .",
    "the source stellar energy distributions are the atmospheric flux models of @xcite .",
    "their model atmospheres are the basis of the @xcite synthetic spectral atlas , which has been used to derive atmospheric parameters from spectra in rave data releases 2 and 3 .",

    "this is not surprising , since we have at least five variables ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath30 , [ m / h ] , [ @xmath73/fe ] ) and only eight data points to constrain them ( whereas spectra can count on hundreds of absorption lines as inputs ) .",

    "we assume that the low reddening affecting the high galactic latitude rave stars originates from an homogeneous slab of dust , extending symmetrically for @xmath111 parsecs above and below the galactic plane , with the sun positioned on the galactic plane . in this model ,",
    "sketched in figure  14 , the amount of reddening is directly proportional to the length traversed by the line - of - sight within the dust slab ( indicated by the thicker portions of the lines - of - sight in figure  14 ) . the model is completely defined by the thickness of the slab ( @xmath111 ) , the total reddening at the pole ( @xmath11 , the same value for the north and south poles ) , and the reddening law .",
    "we take the reddening law to be the standard @xmath110=3.1 , valid for the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "investigation of the actual 3d galactic reddening map as inferred from apass+2mass data for rave stars will be carried out elsewhere in this series of papers .",
    "it is worth noticing that typical rave stars are at high galactic latitudes and at a significant distance from the sun .",
    "thus most of them lie outside the dust slab , and the distribution of dust within the slab is not important so that we can characterize it with just two numbers , its thickness and its extinction at the poles .",
    "also the presence of the local interstellar bubble around the sun ( e.g. abt 2011 and references therein ) is of little concern here , all rave and calibration stars below considered lying similarly well beyond it .    , width=283 ]    to derive the amount of total reddening at the poles and constrain the thickness of the dust slab , we considered two samples of stars , characterized by having both accurate atmospheric parameters ( derived from high resolution , high s / n spectroscopy ) and accurate apass and 2mass photometry .",
    "a first sample comes from @xcite , and a second sample is composed of stars from the pastel database @xcite .",
    "distances to these stars were obtained from isochrone fitting as described by @xcite .",
    "these distances are homogeneous with those to rave stars computed in the same way ( see below ) .",
    "the sample of ruchti+pastel stars with unsaturated apass+2mass magnitudes is composed by 242 stars .",
    "they are distributed similarly to rave stars in terms of temperature and surface gravity : those hotter than 5300  k are generally main sequence objects , while giants dominates at lower temperatures . in both the rave survey and the ruchti+pastel sample",
    "the number of giants is larger than the main sequence stars .",
    "they however differ significantly in metallicity : the median metallicity of ruchti+pastel main sequence stars is @xmath400.85 , and @xmath401.41 is that of giants , those of rave stars are @xmath400.17 and @xmath400.43 , respectively . when unsaturated apass photometry will be available for stars up to 7.5  mag , it will be possible to include a larger proportion of standard stars of higher metallicity .",
    "the apass+2mass data for the stars in the ruchti+pastel sample were subjected to the @xmath8 fitting described in sect.3 .",
    "a dense grid of values for the thickness of the slab ( @xmath111 ) and the total reddening at the pole ( @xmath11 ) was explored .",
    "the photometric temperature derived from the @xmath8 fitting was then compared to the spectroscopic values , and the @xmath112 difference evaluated .",
    "the values of @xmath111 and @xmath11 that best represent the galactic extinction are those that tend to null the trend of @xmath112 with @xmath9 , and that minimize both the median value and the rms of @xmath112 .",
    "a value of @xmath113 and @xmath114  pc are found .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath8 fitting assumes the reddening affecting the sloan primary photometric standard bd+17.4708 to be @xmath88 following @xcite .",
    "any deviation from @xmath88 of the reddening affecting bd+17.4708 should be added to @xmath11 . in the existing literature",
    ", various methods have been used to derive @xmath11 ( stellar counts and colors , galaxy counts and colors , interstellar polarization ) .",
    "a probably incomplete list of available literature provides the following determinations ( in chronological order ) : @xmath11=0.023 by @xcite , 0.029 by @xcite , 0.018 by @xcite , 0.054 by @xcite , 0.03 by @xcite , 0.048 by @xcite , 0.057 by @xcite , 0.00 by @xcite , 0.060 by @xcite , 0.024 by @xcite , 0.04 by @xcite , 0.048 by @xcite , 0.00 by @xcite , 0.050 by @xcite , 0.055 by @xcite , and @xmath1150.043 by @xcite .",
    "their mean value is @xmath116 ( @xmath117 , and 0.005 as the error of the mean ) , the same value we found from apass+2mass data of ruchti+pastel stars , which reinforces the confidence on the results of the present paper .",
    "the value of 140 pc we found for @xmath111 well matches the scale height of the youngest stellar population of the galaxy with which dust is intimately related .",
    "future extension of the apass survey to cover stars up to 7.5 mag brightness will greatly increase the number of nearby spectroscopic standard stars , especially among the main sequence stars , and this will provide a stronger handle to fix @xmath11 and @xmath111 , as well as for investigating differences in the total extinction at the north and south galactic poles .",
    "the photometric temperature and reddening of rave stars have been computed according to the @xmath8 procedure described in sect.3 and the results are given in table  1 .",
    "the full table is available electronic only via cds , the electronic edition of this journal and the rave web site .",
    "the electronic version of the table will be kept updated in response to future rave and apass data releases .",
    "in addition to provide apass astrometric positions and magnitudes ( with their respective errors ) for rave dr4 stars , table  1 lists a series of values for the temperature and reddening computed under different conditions , outlined below .",
    "table  1 lists results for 377379 rave spectra ( 336644 stars ) and does not include the rave stars that have been classified as peculiar by @xcite , which will be studied separately and in conjunction with epoch apass photometry . for uniformity reasons , table  1 also does not include the few rave stars for which data are missing in one or more of the @xmath118 photometric bands . by _ slab _",
    "reddening in table  1 , we mean the reddening produced by the line of sight to the given star traversing an homogeneous slab of interstellar dust , extending by @xmath111=140 pc on either sides of the galactic plane ( with the sun centered on it ) , following the standard @xmath119 law and causing a total @xmath116  mag at both galactic poles .",
    "it is completely defined by the galactic latitude and the distance to the given star . finally , rave dr4 computed the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath30 and [ m / h ] ) from observed spectra following two different approaches , named _",
    "kordo _ and _ sparv _ , which are described in @xcite ( where preference is given to _ kordo _",

    "the temperature of rave stars obtained from @xmath118 photometry is compared in figure  15 to spectroscopic temperature from rave dr4 .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic temperatures agree well .    in the top four rows of figure  15 ,",
    "this comparison is carried out separately for stars above and below 25@xmath15 in galactic latitude , which was the original limit of the rave survey to avoid the regions closer to the galactic plane where the reddening becomes relevant and increasingly patchy .",
    "the comparison is carried out separately for @xcite and @xcite distances to rave stars , and for the two different types of spectroscopic temperatures @xmath123 and @xmath124 derived in rave dr4 .    to filter out outliers and lower quality data ,",
    "the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic temperatures in figure  15 is carried out only for stars with best rave and apass data .",
    "only stars with 4 or more independent apass photometric observations and fainter than the 10 mag safe limit for saturation risk are considered .",
    "these stars are further filtered out so that their rave dr4 spectra ( 1 ) have s / n@xmath1445 , ( 2 ) provided valid atmospheric parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath30 , [ m / h ] ) via both _",
    "sparv _ and _ kordo _ pipelines , ( 3 ) passed the chemical analysis pipeline of @xcite , and ( 4 ) do not show peculiarities according to @xcite pipeline .",
    "about 51000 stars are plotted in figure  15 .    for galactic latitudes",
    "@xmath125 , figure  15 shows that there is a negligible bulk difference between photometric temperatures ( assuming the slab reddening described above ) and spectroscopic @xmath123 temperatures for both red - giant / red - clump ( rc ) and main - sequence / turn - off ( ms / to ) stars , with no appreciable difference between @xcite and @xcite distances .",
    "most of the rave stars are out of the dust slab , so their accurate distance does not matter here .",
    "the rms of the differences between photometric and spectroscopic temperature ( @xmath126 ) is 118  k for rc stars and 160  k for ms / to stars , which are comparable to the rms of spectroscopic temperatures derived independently from multiple rave spectra of the same star .",
    "the comparison between photometric and @xmath124 spectroscopic temperatures show a minimal bulk difference for rc stars and instead a substantial one for ms / to stars , while in both cases the rms is similar to what found for @xmath123 .",
    "the effect of fixing @xmath30 and [ m / h ] to the spectroscopic values are explored in the fifth row of figure  15 ( panels @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) .",
    "while somewhat reducing the rms for both rc and ms / to stars , it introduces an offset of about 40 k for rc stars .    at lower galactic latitudes ( @xmath13@xmath12925@xmath15 ) ,",
    "the simple slab reddening shows its limitation on rc stars by introducing some bulk difference between photometric and spectroscopic temperatures for both @xmath130 and @xmath131 , in addition to expanding the rms . at these low galactic latitudes , compensation for reddening",
    "requires a more sophisticated approach , a true 3d model of the reddening distribution that will be derived elsewhere in this series .",
    "the effect of assuming null reddening for rave stars is explored in row @xmath132,@xmath133 of figure  15 .",
    "the net effect is to lower the temperature of both ms / to and rc stars , because the redder energy distribution caused by extinction requires cooler stellar models to be fitted .",
    "the last row of figure  15 ( panels @xmath134,@xmath2 ) , compares spectroscopic and photometric temperatures when all parameters are simultaneously fitted by the photometric data and no assumption on the reddening is done .",
    "the comparison is good for rc stars , with no significant offset ( at least against @xmath123 ) and an rms similar to the cases when the reddening is fixed ( first four rows of figure 15 ) .",
    "for ms / to stars the @xmath9 so derived is instead unreliable , being characterized by a large offset and rms .",
    "the different behaviour between rc and ms / to stars can be traced to the fact that the maximum of the energy distribution for rc stars falls well within the wavelength range covered by the apass+2mass photometric bands , while for hotter ms / to stars this maximum tends to move to wavelengths shorter than covered by apass+2mass .",
    "by adopting the atmospheric parameters from spectroscopy , the fit to @xmath118 returns the reddening . for rave",
    "dr4 stars this is explored in figure  16 .    at higher galactic latitudes",
    "sparv _ rave dr4 atmospheric parameters return a reddening which is very well in line with the _ slab _ reddening , as illustrated in panel @xmath57 of figure  16 .",
    "no trend is present and the offset is essentially null . also _ kordo _ rave dr4 atmospheric parameters return a null trend ( panel @xmath56 of figure  16 ) , with a smaller rms but an appreciable offset .",
    "closer to the galactic plane ( panels @xmath111 and @xmath127 of figure  16 ) the comparison with the _ slab _ reddening shows the limitations of the _ slab _ approach already commented upon above .",
    "the last row of figure  16 compares ( separately for low and high galactic latitudes ) the reddening derived by fixing the atmospheric parameters to the _ sparv _ values and the reddening obtained when the atmospheric parameters are fitted simultaneously with @xmath10 . as noted above for @xmath9 , the comparison is excellent for high galactic latitude rc stars , with a null trend and offset and only a marginal increase in rms .",
    "the comparison is less favorable for ms / to stars and for low galactic latitude rc stars .",
    "figure  17 displays the distribution of the differences between the observed magnitudes and those of the best fitting synthetic stellar model , for three representative panels of figure  15 ( for other panels they look similar ) .",
    "it is not tricking how the distributions for optical bands are much sharper than those for infrared bands .",
    "this reflects the fact that optical bands carry more information ( closer to the peak of the energy distribution and where the effect of the reddening is larger ) than infrared bands , as well as the fact that the errors of 2mass data are much larger than those for apass ( cf .",
    ".    the much greater importance of optical bands compared to infrared ones in constraining the temperature and reddening of stars is reaffirmed in figure  18 . here the same computation done for the first row of figure  15 ( its panels @xmath56,@xmath135 are copied at the top of figure  18 for comparison purposes ) , are repeated by @xmath8 fitting only the apass optical data or only the 2mass infrared data .",
    "it is quite obvious how in the case of optical - only data the overall picture is retained , while for ir - only data the fit is far less constrained .",
    "the apass all - sky , landolt - sloan @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 photometric survey now provides the missing broad - band optical photometric support to the rave spectroscopic survey , and coupled with 2mass @xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 infrared data , it offers a wide - wavelength coverage . the high astrometric and photometric accuracy of the apass data has been verified on a large sample of standard and literature stars . with this first paper in the series , we provide @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 data for the stars included in the latest rave dr4 data release , and derive temperature and reddening for them under different conditions by @xmath8 fitting to a densely populated synthetic photometric library .",
    "the comparison of photometric and spectroscopic temperatures of rave stars shows a good agreement , so that photometric temperature can be either valid _ per se _ or as _ prior _ to spectroscopic analysis .",
    "rave stars at galactic latitudes @xmath136 display an @xmath10 reddening quite well approximated by a slab distribution of the interstellar dust that is characterized by 140 pc extensions on either side of the galactic plane and a reddening at the galactic poles amounting to @xmath116 mag .",
    "future papers in this series will focus on rave peculiar stars , on the 3d structure of interstellar reddening as constrained by the apass+2mass photometry of rave stars , and on the results of the apass extention to brighter magnitude limits and additional @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 photometric bands .",

    "<S> the internal accuracy of the apass photometry of rave stars , expressed as error of the mean of data obtained and separately calibrated over a median of 4 distinct observing epochs and distributed between 2009 and 2013 , is 0.013 , 0.012 , 0.012 , 0.014 and 0.021 mag for @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 band , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the equally high external accuracy of apass photometry has been verified on secondary landolt and sloan photometric standard stars not involved in the apass calibration process , and on a large body of literature data on field and cluster stars , confirming the absence of offsets and trends . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the carlsberg meridian catalog ( cmc-15 ) , apass astrometry of rave stars is accurate to a median value of 0.098 arcsec . </S>",
    "<S> brightness distribution functions for the rave stars have been derived in all bands . </S>",
    "<S> apass photometry of rave stars , augmented by 2mass @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 infrared data , has been @xmath8 fitted to a densely populated synthetic photometric library designed to widely explore in temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and reddening . </S>",
    "<S> resulting @xmath9 and @xmath10 , computed over a range of options , are provided and discussed , and will be kept updated in response to future apass and rave data releases . in the process </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the reddening caused by an homogeneous slab of dust , extending for 140 pc on either side of the galactic plane and responsible for @xmath11=0.036@xmath120.002 at the galactic poles , is a suitable approximation of the actual reddening encountered at galactic latitudes @xmath13@xmath1425@xmath15 . </S>"
