    "one central theme in multi - user information theory ( it ) is the pursuit of single - letter characterizations of the capacity regions for channel coding problems , or the achievable rate regions ( possibly under certain distortion constraints ) for source coding problems .",
    "however , some useful properties of these regions can be identified , e.g. , convexity , even when a single - letter characterization is not available . an immediate question to ask",
    "is whether there exist other properties of the capacity region that do not rely on a single letter characterization .",
    "the following question is of interest in this regard : in a particular multi - user it problem , can the achievability of a rate vector @xmath2 imply the achievability of any rate vector in some region is implied in a channel coding problem , but this trivial case is not interesting .",
    "note here we do not take the subscript of rate @xmath3 to have any specific meaning associated with the user indices , but merely as an integer label to enumerate the rates in question . ] @xmath4 , regardless of the exact probabilistic channel model ?",
    "we show that indeed this is true for the symmetric broadcast problem , and this region can be rather non - trivial .",
    "we denote the largest of such regions @xmath4 as @xmath5 in a channel coding problem , and call it the _ latent capacity region _ implied by @xmath2 ; the _ latent achievable rate region _ can be similarly defined , possibly under certain distortion constraints , for a source coding problem though it is not our main focus .    for broadcast and multiple access channels ,",
    "a precise problem formulation was given in a recent work by grokop and tse @xcite , called _",
    "multicast region _ , which provides a framework to answer the above question .",
    "complete solutions were found in @xcite for broadcast and multiple access channels with * two * and * three * users , but the problem remains open for more than three users .",
    "we believe this problem formulation reveals a more general concept not limited to only these two channels , and thus rename it as the latent capacity ( or latent achievable rate ) region problem to make explicit this generality .",
    "our perspective is different from @xcite in that we wish to highlight the importance of the latent capacity region concept in its  maximum implication \" meaning , and thus we shall define the region in an alternative ( but equivalent ) manner to emphasize this perspective ; our interest in this problem is partially due to an observation made during an earlier work @xcite , as we shall discuss shortly .",
    "one may wonder how a single achievable rate vector @xmath2 can imply the achievability of a certain region . in some cases ,",
    "it is perhaps best explained by the familiar rate transfer argument , that the rate to transmit common messages can be used to transmit individual messages instead , and vice versa .",
    "for example , for a two user broadcast channel , if a common message rate @xmath6 , and individual message rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 are achievable , respectively , then it is not difficult to see that the region of @xmath9 given below is achievable by transferring between common and individual rates ( see also @xcite ) @xmath10 however , for more than two users , such a naive rate transfer argument is not sufficient , and additional processing is needed , as observed in @xcite for the three user case .",
    "in fact , this was exactly the perspective taken in @xcite , where the goal is to exhaust all such rate transfer operations .",
    "the perspective taken in @xcite and that taken here are complementary to each other , and one may suit certain problems better than the other . because of this relation , it is not surprising that the achievability proof of our result also relies on a generalized version of rate transfer operations .",
    "we shall show that when more users are involved , such generalized rate transfer operation requires strategic application of erasure correction codes , which reveals an inherent connection between erasure correction codes and broadcast with common messages . more specifically , in this work , we shall largely stay in the framework of @xcite , and provide a complete solution to the @xmath11-user broadcast channel latent capacity region problem under an additional symmetry constraint , whereas only cases with two and three users were solved in @xcite without such a constraint .",
    ", width=321 ]    the characterization of latent capacity / rate region is important in multi - user it for two reasons .",
    "first , it may facilitate finding a single - letter characterization or an approximate characterization .",
    "for example , a rate - distortion region characterization for the problem of multi - stage successive refinement with degraded decoder side information was given in the form of bounds on sum - rates @xcite as @xmath12 on the other hand , it seems impossible to establish directly the converse for a characterization in the form of bounds on each individual incremental rate @xcite , despite the fact that the two characterizations are equivalent @xcite .",
    "this is not a coincidence , and it is not difficult to show that the latent rate region for this problem has exactly the following form , assuming non - negativity of the rates @xmath13 intuitively , when a rate vector @xmath2 is achievable , its latent capacity / rate region gives the largest achievable region thus implied , i.e. , maximally utilizes it , which may help simplify the representation of the region when taking the union over auxiliary random variables . similarly , when an approximate characterization is needed , a good inner bound may be found by choosing one or several good ( auxiliary coding ) distributions in an information theoretic coding scheme which lead to one or several rate vectors , and then taking the convex hull of their latent rate regions .",
    "one simple example is in @xcite , where an approximate characterization for the side - information scalable source coding problem was given for general sources under the squared error distortion measure , and the inner bound approximation is exactly the latent capacity region implied by a single rate pair .    the second reason making this concept important is even if it does not lead to a single - letter characterization or an approximate characterization , it can still provide insights into the problem .",
    "one such example is that the capacity region can always be written as the ( possibly uncountable ) union of latent capacity regions , which places certain constraints on the geometry of the achievable region . for the above example of successive refinement source coding , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoshapes ] a possible rate region on the left , and an impossible rate region on the right .",
    "the one on the right is impossible because the black dot is in the achievable region , thus the latent capacity region implied by it ( given by the thin line ) must be also in the region , which is not satisfied by the region depicted on the right .",
    "this important observation was also discussed in @xcite ( see corollary 4.3 ) , and we do not elaborate it further . nevertheless , it is rather clear that the latent capacity region indeed provides fundamental and useful property of the rate region , in addition to the well - known convexity .",
    "we first define the symmetric broadcast problem , and then introduce the notion of latent capacity region in this context .    in a general @xmath11-user broadcast channel , the conditional probability distribution",
    "is given as @xmath14,y_2[1,2,\\ldots], ... ,y_k[1,2,\\ldots]\\big{|}x[1,2,\\ldots])\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index in the bracket @xmath15 $ ] is used to denote time ; the random variables have alphabets @xmath16 , and the receivers are indexed as @xmath17 .",
    "the alphabets can be discrete or continuous , and the channel can be memoryless or otherwise ; for our purpose , it is perhaps beneficial , though not necessary , to limit the attention to cases where the channel transition process is ( block ) stationary and ergodic .",
    "we use script letters to denote sets , and particularly , @xmath1 and @xmath18 are reserved for subsets of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 @xmath21 is used to denote the cardinality of set @xmath1 . a length-@xmath22 vector @xmath23 $ ] is sometimes written as @xmath24 ; for a @xmath11 dimensional vector @xmath25 , we sometimes write it simply as @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be @xmath28 mutually independent and uniformly distributed messages , where @xmath29 is the message intended for all the receivers in the set @xmath1 ; for notational convenience , we include @xmath30 but will assume it to be a constant .",
    "for each @xmath31 , define the set of random variables @xmath32 thus @xmath33 is the collection of messages that the @xmath34-th receiver should decode .",
    "we also define the following set of random variables @xmath35 more specifically for @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 where we have slightly abused the notation by writing , e.g. , @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "the sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined similarly for length-@xmath22 random vectors . in this work ,",
    "we only consider the case that the rates of messages @xmath29 are the same for all such messages where the set @xmath1 has the same cardinality .",
    "more formally , the problem is defined as follows .",
    "an @xmath42 symmetric broadcast code consists of an encoder @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath11 decoders , @xmath45 resulting in the decoded messages at the @xmath34-th receiver @xmath46 , and the decoding error probability of at least one message at one receiver @xmath47    a rate vector @xmath26 is symmetrically achievable if there exists a sequence of @xmath48 codes with @xmath49 . the closure of the set of symmetrically achievable rate vectors is called the symmetric broadcast capacity region , denoted as @xmath50 , or simply as @xmath51 .    note",

    "is characterized by investigating the distinct universal encoding / decoding operations , which leads to the concept of extremal rays . because the latent capacity region in question is a polytope , it can be characterized by its faces , edges , or vertices .",
    "the extremal rays are essentially the edges of this polytope . however",
    "this proof approach in @xcite appears rather difficult to generalize for more than three users since the number of edges quickly becomes very large , and thus we introduce the parametric characterization ( [ eqn : condition1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : condition2 ] ) to avoid this difficulty .",
    ".[fig : example122],width=321 ]    notice that the exchange rate is pairwise , suggesting in this symmetric setting there is no need to convert rates jointly , e.g. , use @xmath91 and @xmath92 to send the same message @xmath75 . in the rest of the paper , we shall prove theorem [ theorem : maintheorem ] .",
    "the naive approach of finding the planes of the rate region and derive its upper and lower bounds is not appropriate for general @xmath11 , particularly for the purpose of converse .",

    "the proof of the forward part of theorem [ theorem : maintheorem ] , i.e. , the fact that @xmath76 satisfies the first condition in definition [ definition : lcr ] is relatively straightforward .    since @xmath93 is achievable on any channel , there exists a sequence of codes with such rates with @xmath49 , and we will use these codes to construct a set of codes to approach any rate vectors in @xmath76 .",
    "this is done by essentially relabeling and adding erasure correction codes on the messages .",
    "observe that the messages @xmath94 can also be used to transmit common messages to the subsets with cardinality smaller or larger than @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , we can use part of the rate @xmath3 , denoted as @xmath78 , for this purpose , to transmit some messages @xmath95 , thus increasing @xmath96 .",
    "such an operation will cause a conversion of rate @xmath78 for @xmath81-user subset messages into rate @xmath97 for @xmath82-user subset messages , with an exchange rate @xmath74 .",
    "the region @xmath76 is precisely the result of allowing this kind of pairwise exchange on the rate vector @xmath52 .",
    "thus we only need to show that the exchange rates @xmath74 given before theorem [ theorem : maintheorem ] is indeed valid , then the existing sequence of channel codes can be used directly .",
    "it is clear that we only need to consider the following problem : on a channel with @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , how do we transmit messages @xmath101 , and how much rate @xmath96 can be supported ? we will only need to distinguish two cases @xmath69 or @xmath71 , since it is clear @xmath73 .",

    "this is an erasure correction problem and a @xmath110 maximum distance separable ( mds ) code can satisfy this requirement , which indeed exists when the codeword length is sufficiently large .",
    "furthermore , since each subset @xmath1 of cardinality @xmath81 is a subset of @xmath111 sets of cardinality @xmath82 , only @xmath112 of the rate @xmath0 can be used for each mds code .",

    "the mds codes we use in the above proof can be understood as a generalization of the modulo two addition , which itself is essentially a @xmath119 mds code .",
    "it is worth noting that other coding / processing may also be useful for converting rates , however , mds codes are sufficient in solving the symmetric broadcast problem .",
