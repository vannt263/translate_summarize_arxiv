    "the hadron spectra at high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) arise from fragmentation of high @xmath0 partons or jets from initial hard partonic collisions and are known to follow a power law distribution .",
    "the high @xmath0 hadrons are very important for qgp studies as they measure jet quenching @xcite effect in qgp .",
    "the low @xmath0 hadrons form the bulk of the spectra arising from multiple scatterings and follow exponential distribution depictive of particle distribution in a thermal system which may be more meaningful for heavy ion system .",
    "in addition , for heavy ion systems the hadron spectra at intermediate @xmath0 can arise from quark recombination @xcite .",
    "we review various forms of hagedorn and tsallis distributions which are used to describe p+p collisions at rhic and lhc energies and show their equivalence .",

    "a successful description of particle spectra with the tsallis distribution allow us to calculate the integrated yield which provide important information on the bulk properties of the soft particle production and also used to infer the degree of chemical equilibration when compared with the thermal model @xcite .    in the present work we use tsallis distribution fit to draw systematics from the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectra of identified hadrons measured in p+p collisions at rhic ( @xmath1 = 62.4 and 200 gev ) and at lhc energies ( @xmath1 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7.0 tev ) .",

    "[ fitfun ] can be assumed to be same for all particles at a particular energy .",
    "we can fix it to the value averaged over all particle types or simply use pion @xmath2 for all the particles .",

    "it is observed that the parameter @xmath3 , for pions , kaons and protons , is monotonically decreasing with increasing @xmath1 , which could be understood in terms of changing production mechanism at different collision energies .    the qcd cross sections scale as @xmath42 in terms of the power @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of participating quarks @xcite .",
    "if the dominant process in meson or baryon production is point like scattering @xmath45 ( referred as leading twist ) the number of participating quarks is 4 and hence @xmath46 .",

    "the decreasing value of parameter @xmath3 , for pions , kaons and protons with collision energy in table [ table2 ] indicates that the dominant production process is moving from higher twist to leading twist as one goes up in @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the separation of @xmath3 among pions , kaons and protons decreases as we go from lower center of mass energy ( at rhic ) to higher center of mass energy ( at lhc ) .",
    "this indicates that at higher collision energies the production process is more like @xmath55 point scattering for all particles which gives lower and similar values of @xmath3 for different particles .",
    "lastly , we study all hadron spectra at all energies using fixed values of @xmath2 . from the free fit results given in fig  [ tsallis_fit_t_n_free](b ) we choose two values @xmath2 = 110 mev and @xmath2=95 mev and",

    "although the values of @xmath3 at @xmath2 = 110 mev are greater than their respective values at @xmath2 = 95 mev the general conclusions about @xmath3 remain the same .",

    "we also review various forms of hagedorn and tsallis distributions and show their equivalence .",
    "we obtain the tsallis parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 for pions , kaons and protons and study them as a function of center of mass energy . since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are correlated we fix the value of @xmath2 for all particles at a particular energy to the pion temperature . in general , the tsallis temperature @xmath2 has a decreasing but weak dependence on center of mass energy which means there are less soft collision processes as we move up in energy .",
    "the power @xmath3 determines if the particle is coming from point like qq scatterings ( leading twist ) or from multiple scattering centers involving many quarks ( higher twists ) .",
    "the power @xmath3 decreases with decreasing @xmath1 for all particles in all our analysis which indicates that the production process is moving from higher twist to leading twist as one goes up in @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath3 are found to be 16 for proton spectra 12 for pion spectra at the lowest rhic energy .",
    "another important observation is with increasing @xmath1 , separation of powers for protons and for pions narrows down hinting that the baryons and mesons are governed by same production process as one moves to the highest lhc energy .",
    "separation of @xmath3 for protons and pions is more at lower energy .",
