    "the multiple bandgaps arise from differences in character between the fermi surface sheets on which cooper pairing takes place @xcite . in the two - bandgap superconductor mgb@xmath0 , the two cooper pairing channels moreover appear to be in different regimes : taken",
    "individually they would lead to type i and type ii superconductivity respectively .",
    "therefore , this material was dubbed a type 1.5  superconductor @xcite .",
    "the competing length scales associated with the cooper pairing channels lead to the formation of vortex clusters and stripes @xcite .",
    "the experimental discovery of vortex clustering in mgb@xmath0 has lead to a flurry of activity to develop a two - bandgap ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism suitable to describe these patterns .",
    "the increasing interest in two - band superfluid fermionic system is not restricted to superconductors @xcite .",
    "recently , the superfluidity of multiband ultracold atomic fermi gases has attracted theoretical attention @xcite , anticipating interesting experiments in this field .",
    "quantum gases offer the singular advantage that the adaptability of various experimental parameters ( intraband and interband interaction strength , numbers of atoms , trapping geometry , ... ) allows to study these systems in regimes inaccessible in solids .",
    "a gl theory has been developed for these systems at the microscopic level @xcite , as distinct from the case of superconductivity where many parameters remain phenomenological .",
    "here , we focus on two - bandgap superfluidity in atomic fermi gases throughout the crossover from the weak - coupling bcs regime to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) regime , where pairing of molecules in real space occurs .    in the straightforward two - component gl expansion ( tcgl )",
    "two single - component gl equations are coupled through a josephson term ( see , e. g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and lead to an intervortex interaction that can account for vortex clustering @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of this simple extension has been the subject of intense debate @xcite .",
    "kogan and schmalian @xcite indicate that the two order parameters in a two - band superconductor should have the same length scale of spatial variation in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath1 , when @xmath2 .",
    "since the standard gl formalism is developed for @xmath3 near @xmath1 , these authors conclude that the gl approach fails to adequately describe the existence of two different length scales in a two - band superconductor .",
    "on the other hand , babaev and silaev @xcite argue that the tcgl expansion is justified and properly describes two - band systems with different coherence lengths .",
    "both sides , however , recognize that the temperature range of validity for the tcgl approach is restricted from below by the condition that the order parameter amplitude is small @xcite .",
    "therefore , finding an effective tcgl - like formalism valid well below @xmath1 remains an open question . in refs .",
    "@xcite , an extended two - component gl formalism is found by performing an expansion of the free energy and the gap equation in powers of @xmath4to order @xmath5 rather than @xmath6 as is common for the standard gl formalism .",
    "this approach confirms the existence of two distinct length scales @xcite .",
    "however in practice a complete summation of the series over @xmath7 is not feasible .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a tcgl model with phenomenologically determined coefficients yields an accurate description of vortices and of the magnetic response of a two - band superconductor in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "models where the gl parameters are calculated from a microscopic theory are available in the limit of weak - coupling bcs superconductors ( e. g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the assumption of slowly varying fields was a key ingredient . here",
    ", we invoke the same assumption to develop a theory that avoids any additional approximation ( for example , small @xmath7 , small pair field , or weak coupling ) and that retrieves in limiting cases the results of known effective field theories .",
    "our finite - temperature effective field theory retrieves the zero - temperature effective field theory @xcite in the limit @xmath8 throughout the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "also in the other limit , @xmath2 , the obtained eft analytically reproduces the results obtained by the microscopic path - integral treatment for the homogeneous superfluid in the entire bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the effective field theory that we obtain in this way has been applied successfully to dark solitons in ultracold fermi gases @xcite , where it shows a good agreement with bogoliubov - de gennes theory .",
    "the present work for the first time systematically describes the derivation of the finite temperature eft formalism , which is only briefly represented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and applies the theory to describe vortex structure in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "next , we extend the effective field theory to interacting mixtures of superfluid fermi gases . when two pairing channels are available , these systems represent the quantum gas analog of the two - band superconductors discussed above . specifying the species of trapped atoms , their hyperfine states , and the number of trapped atoms , fixes unambiguously the microscopic hamiltonian in terms of scattering lengths , chemical potentials , and masses . starting from the microscopic action functional for two - band atomic fermi gases with @xmath9-wave pairing",
    ", we obtain unique expressions for the parameters of the effective field theory for the two band superfluid , including expressions for the josephson coupling between the two order parameters as a function of the scattering lengths .",
    "the resulting effective field theory reveals the presence of two healing length scales in the two - band superfluids , in close analogy to the so - called hidden criticality discussed for two - band superconductors . in order for the theory to be capable of describing the experimentally relevant collective excitations of superfluid fermi gases , a derivative expansion keeping only the first order derivatives of the pair field over time ( performed , e.  g. in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is not sufficient : second - order time derivatives are required to determine collective excitation spectra of fermi superfluids .",
    "including these second - order derivatives , we obtain the collective modes including the leggett mode , and compare the results obtained in the framework of superfluid two - band systems to experimental results obtained for the leggett mode in two - band superconductors .",

    "[ eft ] , we derive the effective field action and the field equations for a single - component fermi superfluid ( subsection [ subsec2a ] ) . in this part",
    "we also compare the results for the thermodynamics of the uniform system to the results of the microscopic description to show the validity of the field theory for a large temperature range in subsection [ subsec2b ] .",
    "also the structure of a vortex in the bcs - bec crossover ( subsect . [ subsec2c ] ) , as well as the collective excitation spectrum ( subsect . [ subsec2d ] ) are calculated and compared to existing treatments such as the bogoliubov - de gennes treatment . in the second part ( sect .",

    "an effective field theory for the superfluid order parameter constitutes a powerful tool to study non - uniform phenomena in fermionic superfluids , such as vortices , solitons , and the effects of strong confinement .",

    ". these approaches are complementary to microscopic descriptions such as the bogoliubov - de gennes approach .",
    "the latter works well for small number of particles , whereas a description in terms of an effective field theory meets no difficulties for large numbers of particles@xmath10 including the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the other advantage of an effective - field based description is that this usually requires much less computation time and memory than the bogoliubov - de gennes calculation . up to now , ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type effective field theories have been developed for superfluid fermi gases at @xmath11 @xcite or at @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the expansion has been performed up to second order in both spatial gradients and time derivatives , so that the resulting effective field theory is capable of describing collective excitations for temperatures below @xmath1 .",
    "the finite - temperature eft is a straightforward extension of several preceding approaches : the effective field theory developed for @xmath266 @xcite and that developed for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the current formalism corresponds with these approaches in the appropriate limiting cases .",
    "also we retrieve the bcs - bec theory result for the ground state energy at @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the results for vortices ( described here ) and for solitons ( described in ref @xcite ) correspond well with the results obtained from bogoliubov - de gennes calculations .",
    "the advantage of the current formalism is that the coefficients of the proposed action functional ( [ seft ] ) are closed and tractable expressions , which turn to the known gl coefficients in the limit @xmath2 , and are fast to compute .",
    "the present eft describes the ultracold fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover , smoothly passing the unitarity regime , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite and the related analytic theories .",
    "the unitarity regime needs however a special care , as discussed in sect .",
    "accurate quantitative results have been obtained at unitarity and @xmath97 using numeric approaches @xcite , and analytically , using different methods , e. g. @xmath267-expansion @xcite , @xmath268-expansion @xcite , the renormalization group methods @xcite . however",
    ", these analytic methods are focused at the unitatity regime . at present , to the best of our knowledge , there is no known analytic theory which accurately quantitatively describes the fermi gases in a unified way through the whole bcs - bec crossover , including the unitarity point .",
    "therefore the analytic theories smoothly describing the ultracold fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover are useful , because they can provide a reasonable description of ultracold fermi gases in the whole range of the coupling strength , except the aforesaid singularity point .",
    "it is established in ref .",
    "@xcite that the solution for the critical temperature obtained within the functional integral method accounting for gaussian fluctuations about the saddle point smoothly interpolates between the two limiting cases  bcs and bec regimes .",
    "many subsequent works use analytic approximations similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite for the thermodynamic functions of ultracold fermi gases ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "also our work follows this direction , being particularly aimed on the treatment of the ultracold fermi gases below @xmath1 .    the second main result of this work is the extension of the effective field formalism to the case of two - band fermionic superfluids .",
    "the resulting effective field action contains the same input parameters ( the scattering lengths and the interband coupling strength ) as those in other approaches to the two - band superfluidity / superconductivity , e. g. refs .",
    "these input parameters can be independently measured and even precisely controlled  for ultracold gases .",
    "they completely fix the microscopic hamiltonian for the mixture of two atomic fermi superfluids , with cooper pairing within each superfluid and contact interactions between the atoms belonging to different superfluids . in the effective bosonic action obtained by the path - integral treatment of this hamiltonian ,",
    "the two superfluid order parameters are coupled by a josephson term that is not introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ , but follows directly from applying the hubbard  stratonovich transformation , before any approximation is made .",
    "this josephson coupling is kept also after performing the gradient expansion which results in the effective two - field theory .",
    "for the two - band superfluid , the current theory reveals a non - monotonic temperature behavior of the thermodynamic parameters near the ( uncoupled ) critical temperature of a weaker  band , similar to that obtained for two - band superconductors with a bogoliubov - de gennes treatment ( whereas the standard ginzburg - landau treatment fails to reproduce this ) .",
    "also the existence of two healing length scales is captured by the present effective field theory for a two - band fermi superfluid .",
    "the formalism developed here can find a broad spectrum of applications , in particular as a complementary method to the bogoliubov - de gennes equations which are restricted to the mean - field approximation and to the bcs case , and which become cumbersome when many vortices are present .",
    "the present method is applicable in the whole range of the bcs - bec crossover , allows one to take into account the fluctuations , and requires much less computation time than the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism .",
    "moreover , the eft allows one to obtain analytical solutions in some cases where the bogoliubov - de gennes equations can be solved only numerically .",
