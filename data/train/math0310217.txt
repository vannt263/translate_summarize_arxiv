    "in this work , we are interested in the path - wise behaviour of a general class of random walks on the integers , whose path measure is submitted to a special form of exponential perturbation , the physical motivation of which is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "more precisely , to each @xmath27 , we associate an integer non - negative value @xmath28 and for any integer interval @xmath29 we denote by @xmath30 the set of all such trajectories in @xmath31 : @xmath32 let @xmath33 be a convex increasing continuous function with @xmath9 and a bounded growth at infinity :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there exists @xmath34 such that for any @xmath35 we have _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    @xmath36    this property holds clearly for any ( convex ) polynomial function .    the probability of a trajectory @xmath37 is defined then via @xmath38 where the boundary conditions are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the parameter @xmath41 is some strictly positive real number and @xmath42 are the transition probabilities of a 1d integer - valued random walk with zero mean and finite second moment .",
    "we suppose that the random walk is _ strictly aperiodic _ in the sense that its @xmath43-step transition probabilities @xmath44 possess the following property :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there is @xmath45 such that _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    @xmath46    when the boundary conditions are chosen such that @xmath47 , we omit them from the notation .",
    "we will denote by @xmath48 the analogous probability measure without the positivity constraint , and by @xmath49 the associated partition function .",
    "the special case of @xmath50 will be abbreviated to @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "when @xmath53 it is expected that , after a suitable rescaling , the law of the random walk converges to that of a brownian excursion ; at least , it is a direct corollary ot the results in @xcite and @xcite that , in the diffusive scaling , the large-@xmath6 limit of the distribution @xmath54 is non - trivial . in particular ,",
    "the path delocalizes .",
    "when @xmath55 , the behaviour changes drastically : we ll prove below that the path remains localized , and that the correlations between positions @xmath28 and @xmath56 of the random walk decay exponentially with their separation @xmath57 .",
    "our main goal is to investigate how delocalization occurs as @xmath41 decreases to @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding critical behaviour can be analyzed in quite some details and , most interestingly , under very weak assumptions on the original random walk . in this way , it is possible to probe its degree of universality .",
    "the physical motivation for the path measure considered in this work is the phenomenon of critical prewetting .",
    "consider a vessel containing the thermodynamically stable gaseous phase of some substance .",
    "when the boundary of the vessel displays a sufficiently strong preference towards the thermodynamically unstable liquid phase , there may be creation of a microscopic film of liquid phase coating the walls .",
    "as the system is brought closer and closer to liquid / gas phase coexistence , the layer of unstable phase starts to grow . for systems with short - range interactions , two kind of behaviours are possible : either there is an infinite sequence of first - order ( so - called layering ) phase transitions , at which the thickness increases by one mono - layer , or the growth occurs continuously ; this is the case of critical prewetting , and it is typical in two - dimensional systems , as those modelled in the present work .",
    "we are thus interested in quantifying the growth as a function of the distance to phase coexistence .",
    "a natural parameter is the difference between the free energy densities of the stable and unstable phases .",
    "choosing @xmath59 , we see that the perturbation @xmath60 can be interpreted as the total excess free energy associated to the unstable layer , the parameter @xmath41 playing the role of the excess free energy density .",
    "the problem of critical prewetting in continuous effective interface models in higher dimensions , as well as in the 2d ising model , has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the latter results are however restricted to a much smaller class of interactions , and take also a weaker form than those we obtain here .",
    "notice however that the thickness of the layer of the unstable phase in the 2d ising model also grows with exponent @xmath61 , showing ( not surprisingly ) that this model is in the same universality class as those considered in the present work ; one can hope therefore that the finer estimates we obtain here have similar counterparts in the 2d ising model . results about critical prewetting for one - dimensional effective interface models have already been obtained in  @xcite ; they are limited to the particular case of real - valued random walks with @xmath59 and @xmath62 , which turn out to be exactly solvable .",
    "they are thus able to extract more precise information than those we present here , including prefactors .",
    "it is not clear however to what extent these finer properties also have universal significance .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank h.spohn for his interest in this work . o.h .",
    "also thanks l.c.g.rogers , s.molchanov and g.benarous for stimulating discussions .",
