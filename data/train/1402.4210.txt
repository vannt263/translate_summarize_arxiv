    "the increasing demand for accurate control of quantum devices using high - fidelity control protocols@xcite , has stimulated interest in the study of the dynamics of quantum systems in response to slowly varying hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , rapid progress in the field of adiabatic quantum computing has fueled further interest in and need for more careful analysis of the dynamics of quantum systems whose parameters vary slowly in time.@xcite in addition , decoherence in any real quantum system sets a rigid constraint on the time interval during which a quantum protocol must be carried out , limiting all protocols to intermediate time intervals that are shorter than the decoherence time . at these intermediate time scales , both non - adiabatic corrections and coupling to the environment",
    "become equally important .",
    "the previous analysis@xcite of the qubit dynamics with time - dependent hamiltonians was based on the lindblad master equation@xcite that describes the interaction with environment in terms of dephasing and transition processes characterized by phenomenological decoherence rates . an alternative microscopic approach , formulated as a perturbative theory for a quantum system with a time - independent hamiltonian interacting with its environment , introduces the bloch  redfield ( br ) master equation@xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the system changes in time , the br approach has to be modified to properly account for a non - adiabatic corrections .    in this paper",
    "we extend the br approach to account for slow evolution of the system hamiltonian in the presence of the environment .",
    "the main concept of the br theory is based on the identification of decoherence processes in terms of the matrix elements for transitions caused by environment in the eigenstate basis of the quantum system.@xcite for the hamiltonian that varies with time , one can still use a basis defined by eigenvectors of the hamiltonian@xcite , where the hamiltonian is always represented by a diagonal matrix @xmath0 , where the unitary transformation @xmath1 denotes a transition from the original basis to the eigenstate basis .",
    "time - dependence of @xmath1 produces an extra term in the time evolution of the quantum system that is effectively described by the new hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "this expression is not necessarily diagonal and another basis transformation is required .",
    "such series of diagonalization transformations can be continued indefinitely , but for slowly changing hamiltonian , the series can be truncated after a finite number of transformations neglecting terms of the higher order in time - derivatives of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to changes in the effective spectrum of the system , matrix elements representing coupling between the quantum system and its environment are also modified , resulting in a redefinition of the transition rates for the system .",
    "we focus our analysis on the dynamics of a two - level quantum system  a qubit or a spin-1/2 system  in the presence of time - dependent field , which we refer to below as the control field of the qubit .",
    "we study the dynamical response of the transverse magnetization to quench velocity of the control field .",
    "the transverse magnetization measurements can provide the value of the berry curvature of a quantum system  @xcite and , consequently , characterize topological properties of a ground state of the system .    since any real qubit",
    "is always coupled to its environment , it is necessary to perform detailed analysis of the non - adiabatic dynamics of a qubit system in the presence of dissipation . to this end , we investigate the effect of pure dephasing and energy relaxation due to the ohmic bath on the qubit polarization .",
    "our results indicate that the decoherence suppresses the transient wiggles of the out - of - plane qubit projection , thereby bringing up the linear relation between the qubit response and the quench velocity .",
    "thus , the dissipation facilitates the berry curvature measurement based on the non - adiabatic response , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore",
    ", this study is also related to the measurement technique of the berry phase in qubits , which are based on an interference experiment where the drive parameter was changed slowly  @xcite , see also refs .",

    "we also apply the modified br equation to the landau ",
    "zener ( lz ) problem@xcite in a qubit coupled to environment at arbitrary temperature .",
    "the lz problem in a quantum system coupled to its environment has attracted significant interest recently , where the environment was considered either as a source of classical noise@xcite , or quantum fluctuations that cause transitions between qubit states @xcite , or pure dephasing@xcite .",
    "more recently , the lz interferometry has attracted a growing interest@xcite .",
    "here we focus on the role of quantum fluctuations in the environment that cause transitions between the eigenstates of the qubit in the lz problem .",
    "we argue that during the lz transition , the matrix elements of the coupling between the qubit and its environment must be considered in the basis of eigenstates of the full qubit hamiltonian and therefore , the matrix elements acquire an explicit time dependence due to rotation of the eigenstate basis in addition to straightforward dependence on the energy difference between the eigenstates .",

    "@xcite , since this can be included in the redefined control field of the qubit .",
    "we focus solely on the transition effects due to non - unitary evolution of the qubit density matrix .",
    "we consider the quantum fluctuations of the environment that are fixed along the direction of the control field at very long initial and final moments of the lz transition so that the matrix element that characterizes the transition between qubit states at long times is absent and environment produces dephasing only",
    ". for arbitrary direction of the fluctuating field , the transition remains effective over long time and will effectively bring the qubit to the ground state for zero temperature environment .",
    "we also consider `` dephasing '' coupling@xcite when the quantum fluctuations occur only in the direction parallel to the direction of the control field in the parameter space of the qubit hamiltonian .",

    ", the qubit hamiltonian is renormalized by the environment modes with @xmath22 , known as the lamb and stark effects . on the other hand ,",
    "when we integrate out the environmental degrees of freedom , we also obtain non - unitary terms in the evolution of the quantum system .",
    "both of these effects are accounted for by the br equation@xcite for the qubit density matrix @xmath23 .",

    "the factor @xmath32 indicates that only the component of the fluctuating environment field that is perpendicular to the direction of the control field @xmath33 gives rise to the qubit flip processes .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are characterized by the decoherence rate @xmath34 and pure dephasing rate @xmath35 given by @xmath36    the decoherence stems from two processes  the qubit flip processes with rate @xmath37 , and pure dephasing which is not responsible for energy transitions at low frequency with rate @xmath38 .",
    "the only source of pure dephasing is the fluctuating fields of the environment along the external field @xmath33 , hence the factor @xmath39 in the definition of the pure dephasing term , @xmath40 .",
    "the renormalization of the qubit hamiltonian by the environment due to the lamb or stark effects are determined by the imaginary part of the environmental correlation function , as discussed in ref .",
    "explicitly , the renormalized qubit energy @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "below , we assume that the control field @xmath33 already includes renormalization effects from the environment . the goal of this paper is to investigate the features of the qubit evolution originating from decoherence characterized by rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the significance of the effect of the lamb and stark shifts on the evolution of the qubit was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the lz problem .",
    "we note that the qubit density matrix can be defined in terms of the magnetization in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions as @xmath49 then the br equations , eq .",
    ", acquire a more common form of the bloch equations    [ eq : blochall ] @xmath50    the above br equations were obtained in the basis of qubit eigenstates . in case",
    "when the control field @xmath4 changes in time , we perform transformation @xmath51 of the basis that keeps the qubit hamiltonian diagonal .",
    "this basis is commonly referred to as adiabatic .",
    "the corresponding transformation has two consequences .",
    "the first consequence of @xmath51 transformation is that the hamiltonian in the new basis acquires an extra term originating from the time dependence of the transformation @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the qubit hamiltonian in the new basis is @xmath52 the resulting hamiltonian still may remain non - diagonal due to the berry connection term , @xmath53 .",
    "we can introduce a new transformation @xmath54 that diagonalizes the right hand side of , but this transformation generates a new term @xmath55 and the `` diagonalization '' series of transformations @xmath56 does not stop for an arbitrary time evolution of @xmath4 , because the berry connection terms appearing in each consecutive diagonalization transformation acquires an extra time derivative .",
    "however , for slow time evolution , the series of transformations can be truncated by the first one or two transformations . since the br treatment of environmental effect requires anyway that the system changes in time slower than the rates given by eqs .   and in the master equation , the truncation to a limited number of transformations @xmath56 under slow evolution of @xmath4 is justified .",
    "also , in a special case of constant rotation of @xmath4 in a plane , the second transformation @xmath57 is time - independent and transformation series stops after this second basis rotation .",
    "the second consequence of the basis transformations is the modified interaction term in that the coupling between the qubit and its environment @xmath58 is modified from the initial coupling operator @xmath59 to the environment field by the transformation matrix @xmath60 .",
    "this transformation changes the corresponding `` projection '' factors @xmath61 in eqs .   as well as the spectral weights @xmath29 .",
    "modification of the coupling between the qubit and its environment , introduced by eq .  ,",
    "swaps components of the fluctuating field responsible for the pure dephasing and transition processes .",
    "for example , in case of a fixed external field @xmath62 , fluctuations along @xmath63 give rise to pure dephasing and do not cause transition processes between qubit eigenstates .",
    "however , as @xmath4 rotates while @xmath9 remains in @xmath63 direction , the fluctuating component along field @xmath4 is the only one responsible for the dephasing with the corresponding rate proportional to the spectral weight of its low - frequency fluctuations @xmath64 , while the component of the fluctuating field perpendicular to @xmath33 will produce qubit flip processes with the rate characterized by the spectral weight of fluctuating field with the energy equal to the energy of qubit flip @xmath65 .",
    "the second unitary transformation further mixes matrix elements of the coupling to environment representing qubit flip processes and pure dephasing .",

    "we observe that at stronger decoherence rate , when the off - diagonal unitary terms in the evolution of the density matrix can be neglected in comparison with the decoherence terms , @xmath354 in the lz problem , the two solutions are equivalent .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a detailed analysis of the dynamics of an open quantum system in the presence of time - varying control field .",
    "specifically , we applied the bloch - redfield formalism to a spin-1/2 system whose hamiltonian varies slowly with time and investigated two problems . in the first problem , we studied the response of a qubit to a rotating control field of the qubit with a fixed magnitude .",
    "we noted that when the qubit basis is transformed to keep the effective hamiltonian in the diagonal form , which is required for proper perturbative analysis of the coupling between the qubit and its environment , the transformed hamiltonian acquires extra gauge terms .",
    "the gauge terms result in the modification of the qubit  environment coupling and are related to the renormalization of the mass and friction terms due to changing parameters of the hamiltonian , cf .",
    "the exact form of the renormalization depends on a particular orientation of the control field with respect to the fluctuating environment field .",
    "we have illustrated this scenario by considering different orientations of the environment field : ( 1 ) control field and fluctuations are always perpendicular to each other , and the corresponding relaxation rates are time - independent ; ( 2 ) control and fluctuation fields are parallel only at some moments of time , in which case the relaxation rates significantly oscillate in time ; ( 3 ) fluctuations are always along the direction of the control field , then the relaxation rates are small in the parameter given by the ratio of the rotation velocity and level separation .",
    "our analysis offers a clear evidence of robustness of topological features against external noises . to see",
    "this one needs to consider a long time limit where the qubit density matrix reaches a steady state solution that at zero temperature coincides with the ground state of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "when this ground - state qubit configuration is looked at in the original laboratory basis , the qubit has a constant projection in the direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation and the magnitude of the projection is proportional to the product of rotation velocity of the control field and the berry curvature of the qubit ground state . in the long time limit , this response is unaffected by the environmental coupling field , at least for zero temperature environment .",
    "this relation of the response at long times and the berry curvature can be utilized as a practical method for measurements of the chern number@xcite of a quantum system .",
    "we also considered an environment with a very sharp spectral function .",
    "we represent this environment by a quantum harmonic oscillator that has internal relaxation . in this case",
    "we solve the lindblad master equation for the system of coupled qubit and oscillator and find that the results are qualitatively similar to the solution of the br equation with properly chosen relaxation rates .    in the second example",
    ", we revisited the landau  zener problem .",
    "in this case , the modification of the matrix elements for transitions between eigenstates of the qubit hamiltonian is essential , even though it was not always taken into account.@xcite the eigenstate basis that is necessary to use in treatment of interaction of the qubit with its environment is also convenient for numerical evaluation because in this basis the system behavior during the landau ",
    "zener level crossing is represented by a smooth function that quickly reaches its long - time asymptotic value .    for a qubit",
    "weakly coupled to the environment , the evolution , long after the level crossing , reduces to suppression of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and relaxation of the excited state to the ground state , the latter is accurately described by the rate equations . for the fluctuating field along the asymptotic direction of the control field , the relaxation rate decreases as the level separation increases due to suppression of the matrix elements of qubit transition between eigenstates caused by the environment . however , this suppression is not sufficient to cut the relaxation in the long time limit , and the relaxation results in a power law decay of the excited state , until the separation between the qubit states exceeds the ultra - violet cutoff of the environment .    at finite temperature ,",
    "in addition to enhancement of decoherence rates for the qubit , the excitation processes produce transitions from the ground to the excited qubit states , eventually increasing the probability for the qubit to appear in the excited state after the transition .",
    "the br equations accurately describe the crossover for the landau  zener transition in an isolated quantum system , eq .",
    ", with unitary evolution , to the open system at arbitrary temperature , see sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .    furthermore , we compare the results obtained from the generalized br equations with that from the lindblad master equation . in particular , we focused on the case of pure dephasing lindblad superoperators,@xcite that are equivalent to the longitudinal coupling of the environment ( fluctuating field of the environment is along the control field ) .",
    "we found that the two results are consistent in the high temperature limit , when the lindblad and br equations are equivalent , but application of the lindblad equation for a system coupled to low temperature environment may result in unphysical solutions .",
    "finally , we note that the generalization of the bloch ",
    "redfield equations can be applied to accurately evaluate the fidelity of quantum gates . by taking into account proper modification of the transition and dephasing rates caused by time - varying parameters in the hamiltonian ,",
    "optimization techniques for gate operations can be further improved .",
    "similarly , the br equations for time - dependent hamiltonian are also required for accurate description of protocols for adiabatic quantum computing and the berry phase measurement in recent experiments .",
