    "corrections are small and the mass difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath20 is in general predicted to be at most a few mev  @xcite , thus it is important to measure the @xmath0 mass to better than @xmath21mev .",
    "the @xmath0 is expected to be narrow ( @xmath22mev in width ) , to have a dominant @xmath23 transition to @xmath1 , and large branching ratio to light hadrons  @xcite .",
