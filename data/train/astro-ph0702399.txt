    "feedback from quasars and their less luminous cousins active galactic nuclei ( agn ) - via radiation , highly directional relativistic jets , and slower wide angle winds - has been recognized as a potentially crucial input to cosmology ( e.g. ciotti & ostriker 1997 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al . ; 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; elvis et al . 2002",
    "; hopkins et al . 2005 ; nulsen et al .",
    ". however , while the first two mechanisms have been known for a long time , the prevalence and strength of quasar winds is only now becoming clear . without a firm physical grasp of the wind mechanisms ,",
    "their importance must remain speculative .",
    "the most fundamental question is where do quasar winds originate ?",
    "proposals span a factor @xmath15 in radius and include ( a ) the narrow line region(e.g .",
    "kinkhabwala et al .",
    "2002 ; ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) , ( b ) the inner edge of the ` obscuring torus ' ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) , and ( c ) the accretion disk itself ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "discriminating among these widely different scales ( @xmath16 kpc to @xmath17 pc ) requires the independent determination of a quantity which is not directly observable : the electron density @xmath18 of the outflowing material , which then gives the distance @xmath19 from the central ionizing source .    ionized absorption outflows ( _ warm absorbers _ :",
    "wa ) have been observed in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray spectra of @xmath20 % of seyfert 1s ( e.g. crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) and quasars ( piconcelli et al . 2005 ) , with line of sight velocities of the order of a few hundreds to @xmath21 km s@xmath22 .",
    "such high detection rates , combined with evidence for transverse flows ( mathur et al .",
    "1995 ; crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 , arav 2004 ) suggest that was are actually ubiquitous in agn , but become directly visible in absorption only when our line of sight crosses the outflowing material .",
    "recent efforts to understand was have concentrated on the accurate spectral modeling of the hundreds of bound - bound and bound - free transitions directly visible in the time - averaged , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , high - resolution x - ray spectra of nearby seyferts ( e.g. krongold et al . 2003 ; netzer et al .",
    "while these studies have been decisive in showing that there are just a few distinct physical components in these outflows , only average estimates of the product @xmath23 could be derived from such time - averaged spectral analyses .",
    "this is due to the intrinsic degeneracy of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the equation that defines the two observables : the average ionization parameter of the gas @xmath24 and the luminosity of ionizing photons @xmath25 .",
    "it was recognized some years ago ( krolik & kriss 1995 ; reynolds et al . 1995 ; nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ) that there is an unambiguous method to remove this degeneracy : by monitoring the response of the ionization state of the gas in the wind to changes of the ionizing continuum , it is possible to measure the density of the gas and , hence , its distance from the ionizing source . since the ionization parameter depends linearly on the ionizing flux , it needs to be assumed that the density and location of the absorber do not change on the typical timescales of variability .",
    "this method has been applied in the past to constrain the location of the absorber .",
    "for instance reynolds et al .",
    "( 1995 ) applied this technique to asca data of mcg -6 - 30 - 15 and concluded that the absorber should be located at subparsec distances from the central source .",
    "nicastro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded , based on rosat data , that the absorber in ngc 4051 should be located at a distance @xmath113 l - d from the supermassive black hole (  [ nic1 ] ) .",
    "netzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used _ chandra _ and asca data of ngc 3516 to place the absorber at subparsec distances from the ionizing source .",
    "netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and behar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the lack of variability in timescales of days for the warm absorber in ngc 3783 , and set a lower limit @xmath111 - 3 pc on the distance of the warm absorber , while krongold et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported variations in this source on timescales @xmath11 1 month , and placed the absorber within 6 pc .",
    "reeves et al .",
    "( 2004 ) further reported variability of the fe xxv and xxvi absorption lines in ngc 3783 and located the gas within 0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole .",
    "other methods have also been used to measure the location of the absorbing gas .",
    "kaastra et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported the detection of an o v absorption line arising from a meta - stable level in mrk 279 , and used it to constrain the density of the gas .",
    "these authors placed the absorber at distances between 1 light week to few light months from the central source .",
    "gabel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detected meta - stable absorption from c iii in one of the three absorption components present in the uv data of ngc 3783 ( the highest velocity component ) and place this uv absorber at a distance of 25 pc .",
    "he also concluded that the gas producing the other two uv velocity components must be located anywhere within 25 pc ( the uv absorbers have been associated with the x - ray absorber , gabel et al .",
    "such different determinations of the absorber location may be reflecting simply the fact that we are observing a large scale outflow , with different components .",
    "however , we note that to determine the origination radius of the wa winds it is always the smallest radius found the one that gives the strongest constraint .    here ,",
    "we follow the response of the absorbing gas in ngc 4051 to rapid changes in the continuum , using high s / n xmm-_newton _ data of this source , in combination with a detailed multi - phase ionized absorber spectral model ( phase , krongold et al . 2003 ) and the constraints provided by time - evolving photoionization ( nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ) , to produce an accurate determination of the absorber density and distance .",
    "ngc 4051 is a low luminosity ( @xmath26 , ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) , low black hole mass ( m@xmath0 m@xmath1 , peterson et al . 2004 ) agn , which varies rapidly ( @xmath11 1 hour ) and with large amplitude ( a factor @xmath1110 ; mchardy et al .",
    "we use a novel technique that takes great advantage of the complementary high resolution in the rgs grating data and the high s / n in the epic ccd data , to effectively track the changes in the wa properties over small time scales .",
    "ngc 4051 was observed for @xmath11117 ks with the xmm - newton observatory , on 2001 may 16 - 17 ( obs . i d .",
    "0109141401 ) .",
    "the source varied by a factor of a few on timescales as short as 1  ks , and by a factor of @xmath1112 from minimum to maximum flux over the whole observation ( see fig . [",
    "lcurve]a ) .",
    "we retrieved the data from the xmm-_newton _ data archive and reprocessed the observations using the xmm newton science analysis system ( sas v6.1.0 ) .",
    "the task epchain was used to obtain calibrated event lists for the epic - pn camera ( struder et al .",
    "2001 ) which has a better calibration below 0.8 kev than epic - mos .",
    "epic - pn operated in small - window mode with medium filters , ensuring a negligible level of pile - up .",
    "the last 14 ks of the observation had a background level significantly increased due to the presence of soft photons and these data were not included in our analysis .",
    "we reprocessed the rgs ( den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) data and extracted spectra using the task rgsproc . spectral modeling was carried out with the sherpa ( friedman , doe , & siemiginowska 2001 ) package of the ciao software ( fruscione 2002 ) .",
    "we modeled the rgs continuum with a complex model consisting of a power - law plus two thermal components attenuated by absorption due to our own galaxy ( @xmath27 @xmath28 , elvis , et al .",
    "strong residuals were evident in the spectrum ( @xmath29 d.o.f . ) .",
    "narrow emission lines have been reported in the spectrum of ngc  4051 from a 2002 november xmm - newton observation , when the source was in a very low state ( pounds et al .",
    "the lines have constant intensity ( pounds et al .",
    "2004 ) , so we included in our models the strongest 8 emission lines with the parameters fixed at the 2002 november values ( table [ tabem ] ) , which we determined fitting the rgs data of that observation ( the analysis of this observation will be presented in the future ) .",
    "our model for the total rgs 2001 observation was statistically better than the previous one without lines ( @xmath30 d.o.f . ) , confirming the presence of these features .",
    "however , the spectrum still showed large residuals similar to those produced by an ionized absorber . in particular , strong residuals were present in regions consistent with strong absorption lines by h - like and he - like ions of o , n , and c.    we then added to our model an ionized absorbing component using phase ( krongold et al . 2003 ) , a spectral code that has proven highly successful in modeling absorption by photoionized gas .",
    "phase has three free parameters for each component : the ionization parameter , @xmath31 , in the 0.1  kev-10  kev range ( netzer 1996 ) ; the equivalent h column density , n@xmath32 , and the line of sight outflow velocity of the absorber , @xmath33 .",
    "a fourth parameter , the turbulent velocity of the gas , was set to 300 km s@xmath22 ( see krongold et al .",
    "2003 for details ) . throughout the paper",
    "we have assumed solar elemental abundances for the absorbing gas ( grevesse et al .",
    "the inclusion of this ionized absorbing component significantly improved our fits ( @xmath34 d.o.f . ) .",
    "an f - test indicates that the absorber is required at a significance level of 99.99% .",
    "however , this model still left weak residuals in the region between 12 - 14   where fe l - shell lines are intense , suggesting the possible presence of a second ionization component , as has been found for other seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. steenbrugge et al . 2003 ; krongold et al .",
    "2003 ; blustin et al .",
    "2005 , costantini et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we thus included a second ionization component in our model and re - fit the data .",
    "this model ( reported in table [ tab1 ] ) fit better ( @xmath35 d.o.f . )",
    "than the one absorber model .",
    "an f - test shows that the second absorbing component is required at a significance level of 99.99% .",
    "this is consistent with results from other analyses of this source where two absorbing components were also found ( e.g. pounds et al .",
    "2004 ; ogle et al .",
    "one of the two absorbing components the low ionization phase ( lip ) , has an ionization parameter two orders of magnitude smaller than the other component , the high ionization phase ( hip ) .",
    "we will further show in  [ loc ] that these two components do not represent just a sufficient fit to the absorber ( that could instead be formed by a continuous radial distribution of ionization parameters ) , but that they are two genuinely distinct absorbing phases .",
    "figure [ 2abs ] shows the rgs spectrum with our best - fit model .",
    "finally , we note that , in modeling the same ngc 4051 spectrum , pounds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also used a description of the continuum with two thermal components ( uttley et al .",
    "2004 also required two thermal components for their analysis of the epic data of ngc 4051 ) .",
    "ogle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found , however , that conventional continuum emission processes can not explain the `` soft excess '' in the spectrum of ngc4051 .",
    "however , we note that ogle et al .",
    "did not explore the possibility of two blackbodies in their models .",
    "instead , they used relativistic emission lines of the entire o  viii series plus radiative recombination to describe the continuum .",
    "the nature of the soft excess observed in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies is still not well understood . in the case of ngc 4051",
    ", we note that the data is not sufficient to decide between two blackbodies and relativistic emission by o  viii .",
    "both models provide a good description of the continuum emission , and we point out that using one or the other representation of the continuum has no effect on the results found here for the ionized absorber in ngc  4051 .",
    "ogle et al ( 2004 ) reported the presence of two broad emission lines ( o vii @xmath36 [ r ] and c vi @xmath36 [ ly@xmath37 ) , presumably from the broad emission line region , in the spectrum of ngc 4051 .",
    "there is indeed an excess of flux with respect to the fitted continuum in our models , in the ranges 21 - 22  , and 33 - 34 (see also figure 5 in ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) , where these lines should be present .",
    "we thus added two gaussians to our model and , according to an f - test , found that these broad features are required with a 99.9% level of confidence .",
    "however , despite this large statistical significance , the lines rise only 5 - 10% above the continuum level which makes their detection unreliable .",
    "possible residual calibration uncertainties , among other effects , could in principle produce similar features . to further test",
    "whether the emission lines are real detections or not , we looked for possible emission by the intercombination and forbidden o vii lines . according to porquet & dubau(2000 ) , in photoionized plasma , even at electron densities @xmath38  @xmath4 the o  vii forbidden line should be @xmath23 times brighter than the resonance line . only at densities",
    "@xmath39 @xmath4 the forbidden line is significantly suppressed ( to about half the brightness of the resonance line ) . however , at these densities , the intercombination lines become 3 - 4 times brighter than the resonance line .",
    "we thus attempted to fit an o vii triplet composed of 3 broad gaussians , imposing these restrictions in the fluxes of the lines .",
    "the data is not consistent with such emission line ratios , implying no significant contribution to the emission by the forbidden and intercombination lines ( as can be seen at wavelengths larger than 22   , where the low energy wing of the forbidden line should be present ) . in order for the resonance line to dominate the emission ,",
    "densities much larger than @xmath40  @xmath4 are required .",
    "however , these lines also need a high ionization state for the emitting gas ( similar to the one of the hip ) , and such large densities would locate the gas within the horizon of events ( see  [ geom ] ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the flux excess between 21 and 22   is due to a broad o vii line .",
    "furthermore , 5 - 10% flux excesses can be found in other regions of the spectra where broad emission lines are not expected .",
    "we conclude that the present data is not suitable for detecting such broad and weak emission features .      from figure",
    "[ 2abs ] , we note that the the hip is not as evident ( visually ) in the data as the lip due to several instrumental features in the rgs detector that lie very close to the expected absorption lines , compromising their identification .",
    "in addition , in the region between 10 and 14  where most of the absorption features of the hip lie , the rgs s / n is limited .",
    "only the rgs 2 detector is in operation in this region , while at higher energies , where more hip absorption lines are expected , the sensitivity of the rgs declines rapidly , making the detection of this component difficult .    as noted by williams et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the gratings on board _ chandra _ have a notably better sensitivity for detecting individual narrow absorption lines .",
    "thus , to further confirm the presence of the hip we retrieved and analyzed a @xmath41 ks _ chandra _ hrc - letg observation of ngc 4051 ( a full analysis of these data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ) , carried out in july 2003 , for which the source flux is similar to that during the xmm observation ( the flux in the 6 - 35   range was @xmath42 erg @xmath28 s@xmath22 during the xmm observation and @xmath43 erg @xmath28 s@xmath22 during the _ chandra _ observation ) .",
    "we modeled these data following the same approach we used with the rgs data .",
    "our model clearly indicated the presence of the same two components found in the rgs data , with similar column densities and outflow velocities .",
    "the ionization parameters measured for both components were also indistinguishable in the two spectra , implying an absorber close to photoionization equilibrium ( log  u@xmath44(chandra )  =  -3.14 ; log  u@xmath45(chandra)@xmath46 ) .",
    "figure [ chandra ] presents our model over the _",
    "chandra _ data .",
    "the presence of both the lip and hip components is evident in the spectrum , and an f - test gives a significance larger than 99.99% for the presence of the second absorbing component ( the hip ) .",
    "the lip produces strong absorption features due to o vii ( lines at 21.6  , 18.63  , 17.77  , 17.40  , and 17.20  ) and ovi ( line at 22  ) , as well as fe m - shell absorption ( the unresolved transition array or uta , between 15 and 17  ) .",
    "the hip produces absorption lines by o viii ( at 18.97  ) , ne ix - x ( at 13.45  , 12.13  , 11.54  , and 11.00  ) , and fe l - shell lines ( between 10 and 15  ) , in particular by fe xix ( intense lines at 13.80  , 13.64  , 13.55  , 13.52  , 13.50  , 13.46   and 13.42  ) , fe xx ( intense lines at 13.1  , 12.97  , 12.91  , 12.85  , 12.82   and 12.57  ) , and fe xxi ( most intense line at 12.28 ) .",
    "we note that in both the rgs and letg data there is a significant absorption line at 22.38@xmath470.01 (ew@xmath48 m ) that is not reproduced by the model .",
    "this line can be identified with an o v transition not included in phase .",
    "the feature at 22.80@xmath470.02   ( ew@xmath49 m ) could be an absorption line produced by o iv also missing in phase , though this feature is marginally significant in the data .      to study the response of the absorbers to ionizing flux changes we extracted rgs spectra during a `` low flux state '' ( hereafter ls ) and a `` high flux state '' ( hereafter hs ) .",
    "these states can be clearly identified in figure 1a , and they correspond to a large variation in flux ( by a factor @xmath50 ) over a short timescale ( @xmath51 ks ) . following the approach described in  [ model11 ] , we fit the ls and hs spectra of ngc 4051 separately , but fixing the equivalent h column densities and outflow velocities of the absorbers to the values obtained for the whole observation ( table [ tab1 ] ) . the best - fit ionization parameters of the two absorbing components ( table [ tab3 ] ) vary between the ls and hs , indicating that there are spectral variations that can be fairly modeled as opacity changes between the two states .",
    "these changes in opacity were first noted and reported by ogle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on this same data set , however , these authors did not model the time - dependence of the absorber as we do here .    for the lip ,",
    "the detected change in @xmath52 between the hs and ls rgs data is significant at the @xmath53 level ( table [ tab3 ] ) and , within the errors , the change in ionization parameter is similar to the change in flux ( factor @xmath114.5 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that during the flux increase from the ls to the hs , this absorbing component reaches photoionization equilibrium with the ionizing source . for the hip the statistics are poorer .",
    "however , even for this component a change in @xmath52 is suggested , though significant only at the @xmath54 level , and is consistent with the change in flux within the uncertainties , allowing this absorbing component too to be close to photoionization equilibrium . for the ionized absorbers to reach photoionization equilibrium in 5 ks they must be dense and thus close to the ionizing continuum source .",
    "we will quantify this statement in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] .    the best fit model for the rgs ls is presented in figure [ low_state ] and the best fit model for the rgs hs is in figure [ high_state ] ( in both figs .",
    "the rgs data are binned to @xmath1155 m  per bin ) .",
    "it can be observed that the variations in the spectrum of ngc  4051 are indeed consistent with the changes expected for the wa . in particular ,",
    "the spectral changes in the region between 15 and 18   can be interpreted as variations in the opacity of the gas composing the lip , reflected in the broad feature produced by the fe m - shell uta absorption .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ high_state ] with the hs data by comparing the red line ( the high state model ) with the green line ( the ls model ) . between 10.5 and 15   changes for the hip",
    "are expected , however these changes are less evident than those for the lip , and weaker because of the numerous blends of fe l - shell transitions arising from different charge states .",
    "this make the changes for this component harder to see by eye .",
    "however , comparing the ls and hs models in figure [ high_state ] , broad changes can be observed between 14 and 15  .",
    "additionally , a clear variation in a semi - narrow feature is observed in the complex around 13.5   produced by several transitions of fe xix .",
    "another semi - narrow feature where variation is suggested is the complex around 12.9 produced by several transitions of fe xx .",
    "we note that variations in narrow absorption features are not seen in the rgs spectra at a significant level mainly because of ( 1 ) the limited spectral resolution of the rgs ( 2.4 times broader fwhm than the letg on board _ chandra _ , nicastro et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) and ( 2 ) the low s / n ratio of the ls data .",
    "then , in these data only the strongest absorption lines can be detected , but such lines are heavily saturated , and therefore they are not expected to vary significantly .",
    "in addition blending of weaker lines from different charge states , instrumental features in the rgs coinciding with some of the most promising absorption lines , and line absorption filling by nearby narrow emission lines complicate further the detection of variability in narrow features .",
    "we list some of the non - saturated , unblended , narrow absorption lines that are expected to vary , and are promising to be detected in high resolution data with much higher s / n ( i.e. the data expected to be obtained with future x - ray missions like constellation - x , xeus or pharos ) : for the hip ne  x at 10.24  , o viii at 14.82  , and 15.18  , fe xvii at 10.77  , 11.02  , 11.13 , 11.25  , 13.82  , 14.37  , and 15.26   are expected to be more prominent when the source is at flux levels similar to the one of the low state ( ls ) .",
    "fe xxi at 12.28  , is expected to be prominent during flux levels similar to the hs . for the lip o vii at 17.20   and 17.40  , o vi at 22.03  , o v at 22.37   ( not included in our models ) , and n",
    "vi at 24.90   are expected to be more prominent during the ls .      motivated by the suggested 3@xmath55 and 1.6@xmath55 variability seen with the rgs we analyzed the low resolution , but higher s / n , epic - pn spectrum of ngc 4051 .",
    "the dominance of the broad uta and fe - l shell features in the rgs spectrum of the ionized absorber holds out the promise that this low resolution but higher s / n data could also constrain the changes in opacity of the absorber .",
    "we modeled the epic - pn spectrum of the whole observation using the same spectral components used to model the rgs data ( including a power - law plus two thermal components for the continuum , plus two ionized absorbers ) .",
    "we fit the epic spectrum leaving all parameters free to vary , except the outflow velocity and column density of each absorbing component , which were fixed to the best - fit rgs values .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the ionization parameters derived from the epic data are fully consistent with those obtained independently from the rgs data .",
    "this result shows that when the velocities and column densities of ionized absorbers are constrained by high resolution data , the ionization parameter can be well modeled at ccd x - ray spectral resolution ( see also krongold et al .",
    "2005b ) .    as a further check",
    ", we extracted epic - pn spectra from the same high ( hs ) and low ( ls ) states used for the rgs analysis (  [ rgsvar ] ) .",
    "the change in the opacity of the absorbers detected in the high resolution rgs spectra can also be detected ( though not resolved ) with the higher s / n of the ccd spectra .",
    "quantitatively , the best - fit values of the ionization parameters are consistent with those derived from the high resolution data , for both absorbing components ( hip and lip ) and during both flux states ( ls and hs , see table [ tab3 ] ) . however , the values derived from the epic - pn data are more tightly constrained due to the higher s / n of the ccd data ( with the velocity and column densities fixed at the rgs values ) . for the lip ,",
    "the epic data show opacity variations at a significance level @xmath56 ( table [ tab3 ] ) , confirming the rgs results that were significant only at a @xmath57 level , while for the hip the significance level increases from the 1.6@xmath55 level for the rgs data to a @xmath58 level ( table [ tab3 ] ) . for both components the models are consistent with the gas reaching photoionization equilibrium .",
    "since ngc 4051 varies on typical timescales of a few ks ( fig .",
    "[ lcurve ] ) , the best constraints on the time dependence of the ionized absorbers , will come from spectra in time bins of similarly short duration . in light of the encouraging results with the epic - pn data , we then performed a more finely time - resolved spectral analysis , exploiting the better statistics of the epic - pn data , with the aim of constraining the opacity variations of the ionized absorbers on timescales as short as few ks .",
    "we extracted epic - pn spectra from 21 distinct continuum levels ( _ a - u _ , see fig .",
    "1b ) , though for two intervals ( _ d _ and _ i _ ) the source varied significantly on timescales shorter than @xmath112 ks , so these two are still only `` time averaged spectra '' . to improve the signal to noise ratio of the 21 spectra",
    ", we binned the pulse height data to have 15 original channels per bin .    for each spectrum",
    ", we again fit the continuum with a power law plus two blackbodies attenuated by both neutral absorption due to our own galaxy , plus the eight most prominent ( non - variable ) emission lines ( see  [ model11 ] ) .",
    "we also included two ionized absorbers in our models , as indicated by the high resolution spectra .",
    "we used the following approach : since there is evidence that the shape of the soft excess varies only in amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ tcontour ] , and pounds et al . 2004 ; uttley et al . 2004 ) , we required the temperatures of the two blackbody components to be the same for all 21 spectra .",
    "we also assumed that the two ionized absorbers did not change in n@xmath32 during the observation by fixing n@xmath32 to the same ( best - fit ) value in all the models .",
    "physically , this is plausible as a the column density of the absorber has remained constant for several years ( from the 2001 xmm - newton observation to the 2003 _ chandra _ observation ) .",
    "the fitted n@xmath32 values turned out to be consistent with the ones determined from the rgs data .",
    "the outflow velocity of each absorber was also assumed constant and was constrained to the best - fit rgs value .",

    "looking directly along the cone opening angle an observer would see a much larger column density , @xmath155 @xmath28 ( assuming the wind can reach @xmath150 ) mostly due to the lip ( see appendix a.1 ) .",
    "this high n@xmath32 flow would also be seen to have a larger velocity , perhaps much larger , as in wa we may be seeing the flows before they get fully accelerated .",
    "thus , from this special direction the ngc  4051 wind would begin to resemble a ` broad absorption line ' ( bal ) system ( elvis 2000 ) .    to evaluate the mass loss rate in the wa wind let @xmath156 be the angle between our line of sight to the central source and the accretion disk plane , and @xmath157 be the angle formed by the wind with the accretion disk ( see fig .",
    "[ gwind ] ) .",
    "we can then derive a formula for the mass outflow rate and write it in terms of the observables @xmath158 ( the line of sight outflow velocity ) , n@xmath32 ( the line of sight equivalent h column density ) , and @xmath19 ( see appendix a.2 for full details on the derivation of this formula ) : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a factor that depends on the particular orientation of the disk and the wind , and for all reasonable angles ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) is of the order of unity ( with a variation by a factor of 2 , see fig . [ angles ] ) .",
    "thus , for a vertical disk wind ( @xmath163 ) and an average seyfert 1-like line of sight angle @xmath164 @xmath160=1.5 ( see a.2 ) , and we find : @xmath165 m@xmath1 yr@xmath22 and @xmath166 m@xmath1 yr@xmath22 . for ngc  4051 ,",
    "assuming 10% accretion efficiency , the observed accretion rate is @xmath167 m@xmath1 yr@xmath22 ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , so @xmath168 and @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , the total mass outflow rate from the lip and the hip , in ngc 4051 , is @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the total mass outflow rate is only a small fraction of the observed accretion rate .",
    "we stress here that these estimates of the mass outflow rate from the x - ray disk winds of ngc  4051 depend only weakly on the assumed geometrical configuration ( unless ngc  4051 is seen close to pole - on , see end of  [ loc ] ) .",
    "their robustness is due to the strong constraints that we can independently set on the physical properties of the absorbers .",
    "given the importance that recent theoretical studies have bestowed on agn winds ( see below ) , it is worth investigating the potential implications that warm absorber winds can have on their large scale environment .",
    "some aspects of this discussion are speculative and we do not pretend to present a physical model .",
    "rather , we present only an analysis in terms of energy budgets and order of magnitude estimates .    assuming that the black hole mass of ngc 4051 was all accreted ( m@xmath0 m@xmath1 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , we can calculate the integrated lifetime mass lost due to the x - ray winds , m@xmath172 @xmath173 ( m@xmath174 m@xmath175 ) .",
    "this number is too small for the winds to have an important influence on the ism or igm .",
    "however , ngc 4051 is on the low end of agn black hole masses , luminosities ( @xmath26 , ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) and accretion rates relative to eddington value ( 10% , peterson et al .",
    "if the measured ratio @xmath176 of ngc 4051 is representative of the quasar population , then for winds in powerful quasars ( @xmath177 , m@xmath178 few@xmath179 m@xmath1 ) the total mass outflow could be as large as @xmath180  few@xmath181 m@xmath1 ( neglecting any additional mass from the interstellar medium entrained in the wind ) .",
    "this mass is comparable to that available from the most optimistic estimates of powerful ulirgs winds ( which include significant mass entrainment , e.g. veilleux et al .",
    "2005 ) and could , in principle , be deployed into the igm surrounding the quasar s host galaxy .",
    "the quasar nuclear environment is unusually rich in metals , with metallicities several times solar found in winds from local agn .",
    "fields et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found metallicities 5 times solar in mrk 1044 , and higher values are likely for high z , high luminosity quasars ( e.g. hamman & ferland 1999 ) . on the other hand , metallicities in lyman @xmath147 forest at @xmath182",
    "are low ( 0.01 - 0.001 times solar , pettini 2004 ) .",
    "so , assuming that quasar winds can escape the host galaxy , they could feed their local igm with highly metal enriched material .",
    "this would create local inhomogeneities in the metal content of the igm around such quasars . from our line of sight to powerful quasars , the measured column density of metals in igm systems close to the central object ( at distances up to a few hundred kpc ) would then be much larger ( @xmath183100 ) than in lyman @xmath147 systems located far away from quasars . thus , metal rich igm systems may be significantly stronger close to powerful quasars .",
    "simulations show that , if quasar winds are to be the main process controlling the evolution of the host galaxy and the surrounding igm , they require output kinetic energies of the order of @xmath184 erg ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ; scannapieco 2004 ; king 2003 ) .",
    "such energy outputs would be enough to produce the well known relation between the central black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , or to heat the igm controlling structure formation .",
    "however , lower wind energy outputs may still have an important effect on their environments .",
    "for instance , unbinding the hot phase of the ism may be enough to stop large scale star formation processes in a host galaxy . as this",
    "confining medium escapes from the galaxy , the warm and cold phases must expand , decreasing their temperature and density , and producing a fast decline in the star formation rate ( a full analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper , see also natarajan et al .",
    "evaporating the hot - ism from a typical galaxy requires that the wind heats this medium from its current temperature of @xmath185  k to @xmath186  k. the energy needed to increase the gas temperature by this amount is e@xmath11n@xmath187 t ( where n@xmath188 is the total number of particles in the disk and t@xmath186 k ) . assuming a galactic disk of radius 10 kpc and thickness 0.1 kpc , with a hot - ism electron density of @xmath189  @xmath4 ( smith et al .",
    "2006 ) , implies that an energy input of @xmath190 erg into the hot - ism would heat it to t@xmath186 k and would produce this medium to evaporate , ceasing star formation .",
    "for the observed velocities found in was ( @xmath11 500 km s@xmath22 ) , in @xmath191 yr the gas would move 5 kpc away from the central region , into the host galaxy .",
    "this time is consistent with the lifetime inferred for quasars ( @xmath191-@xmath192 yr ) , and suggests that the wind could indeed affect the host galaxy .",
    "the total kinetic power released by the wind in ngc 4051 ( given by @xmath193 ) is @xmath194 erg s@xmath22 ( assuming the observed outflow velocity of 500 km s@xmath22 ) , and the total kinetic energy deployed into the ism / igm surrounding ngc 4051 would be only @xmath195 erg .",
    "this energy is still an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath196 erg required to disrupt the hot phase of the ism .",
    "however , even wa winds in typical seyfert 1 galaxies ( with black hole masses few@xmath197 m@xmath1 ) would reach this energy , and could have an effect on the hot - ism and star formation processes of their hosts .",
    "if the measured ratio @xmath176 is representative of quasars , then ( assuming velocities in our line of sight of 500 km s@xmath22 ) the total energy deployed by a powerful quasar into the host galaxy ism or the igm , during the agn active phase , could be @xmath11 @xmath198 erg .",
    "thus , winds in powerful quasars could have important effects controling star formation in their hosts ( disrupting the hot - ism ) , but would still be too weak to have a drastic influence on the whole galaxy evolution",
    ". we suggested , however , that we are not seeing the full terminal velocity of the wind (  [ sec : mass - out ] ; proga & kallman 2004 ; elvis 2000 ) .",
    "then , if the winds are accelerated to v@xmath115000 km s@xmath22 , i.e. by a factor of 10 ( which is the ratio between the velocities found in was and balqsos ) , the total kinetic energy deployed by these systems could reach @xmath11 few@xmath199 erg , similar to the binding energy of massive galactic bulges .",
    "this energy is comparable to the 10@xmath200 erg required by simulations for quasar winds to be critically important in feedback processes ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ; scannapieco 2004 ; king 2003 ) .",
    "thus , despite our low mass loss rate estimates , it still remains possible that agn winds are important for at least two major feedback mechanisms : ( 1 ) the evolution of their host galaxies , putting energy into the ism of the host and controlling the accretion process , thus regulating the black hole growth ( the relationship between the mass of the central black hole in galaxies and the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge ) , and/or ( 2 ) enriching with metals the igm and heating this medium , controlling the accretion of material onto galaxies ( thus controlling structure formation ) .",
    "furthermore , the above conclusions are based on a one - object analysis",
    ". the ratio @xmath176 could well be larger for quasars , increasing the mass and energy output of quasar winds . to fully determine what role do agn winds play require measuring agn geometry and kinematics for more normal objects , preferably over a range of black hole masses and eddington ratios .",
    "the response of the ionization state of the absorbing gas in ngc  4051 to variations in the ionizing continuum immediately rules out a radially continuous flow and a large scale ( kpc ) origin for the wa ( at the location of the nlr ) . with a detailed analysis we were able to constrain the density and location of the absorbing gas .",
    "the two - component absorber in ngc 4051 is dense [ @xmath3  cm @xmath201 for the high ionization absorber and @xmath2028.1@xmath610@xmath7  @xmath4 for the low ionization one ] , and its location is close to the continuum source , at distances 0.5 - 1.0  l - d ( 2200 - 4400r@xmath8 ) and @xmath9 3.5  l - d ( @xmath10r@xmath8 ) for the high and low ionization components , respectively .",
    "the two absorbing components are in pressure balance strongly suggesting a two - phase medium .",
    "these results for ngc  4051 place this wa wind on an accretion disk scale , well within the inner edge of a dusty torus or the low ionization h@xmath12 broad emission line region . a continuous radial wind with varying ionization state is doubly ruled out , as the absorbers have a thickness @xmath203r @xmath204 r. this thinness also makes purely radial motion unlikely , given the 50% incidence of ionized absorbers in agns . a bi - conical outflow largely transverse to our line - of - sight is the simplest geometry that can produce the small relative thickness of the absorbers and their high covering factor . since the smallest radius found is the one that gives the strongest constraint on the origination radius of was , we conclude that agn winds must arise from the accretion disk and points us toward physical models for the production of winds from agn disks .",
    "an accretion disk wind can tie together all the absorption and emission features in the spectra of agn , including the broad emission lines ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "the location of the he ii belr is consistent with the position of the absorber , supporting the above picture .",
    "our results are also consistent with the idea that the pc , bi - conical , emission regions observed in seyfert 2 galaxies are the continuation , at much larger distances from the central region , of the warm absorber winds .",
    "the implied mass outflow rate of the warm absorber wind in ngc 4051 is a small fraction of the mass accretion rate ( @xmath205 = 2 - 5% @xmath170 ) .",
    "if all the mass in the central black hole of ngc 4051 was accreted , then the total outflow of mass produced by the wind would be m@xmath172 @xmath173 and the total kinetic energy released by the flow would be @xmath195 erg .",
    "this energy is too small to unbind the entire ism of the host galaxy in this agn , but is comparable to the energy required to disrupt the hot phase of the ism , which could then disrupt star formation .",
    "this suggests that even mild winds in seyfert galaxies might have an important effect in their host galaxies .    only through fully understanding agn outflows",
    ", we will be able to calculate agn feedback accurately .",
    "further studies of less extreme agns over a large range of black hole masses and accretion rates relative to eddington will give a definitive answer .",

    "in this section we derive the column density of a conical wind viewed down the cone .",
    "we assume that the cone bends forming a funnel - shaped geometry .",
    "in such geometry , after the point when the flow bends , it can be considered again as a radial flow . from the equation of mass conservation",
    "it follows that @xmath206 where the subscript @xmath207 stands for the conditions at the base of the radial flow , i.e. the bending point of the flow in the funnel - shape geometry .",
    "we assume that the properties at the base of the radial flow are equal to the measured properties in our analysis .",
    "now consider two forces acting on the gas : the gravitational attraction of the central black hole , and the radiative force on the warm absorber .",
    "since both forces are proportional to @xmath208 , we can simply write the equation of motion for the warm absorber as : @xmath209 with @xmath210 constant .",
    "it can be easily shown that for an object with luminosity l@xmath110.05 l@xmath211 radiative force will dominate over gravitacional force .",

    "we assume that the conditions measured for the lip and the hip in ngc 4051 are representative of the conditions at the base of the radial flow .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath222 is equal to the value obtained in our analysis , that @xmath223 is equal to the observed line of sight velocity of the flow and that @xmath224 . with this conditions , and assuming @xmath225 (",
    "if the flow viewed directly down is observed as a balqso ) then @xmath226 @xmath28 and @xmath227 @xmath28 .",
    "so , the column density in this case is dominated by the lip , and the total equivalent h column density measured down the flow should be @xmath226 @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath156 be the angle between our line of sight to the central source and the accretion disk , and @xmath157 the angle formed by the wind with the accretion disk , as shown in figure [ gwind ] . if @xmath228 and @xmath229 are the projections of the line of sight distance of the wind from the central source ( @xmath230 ) and the line of sight _ effective _ thickness of the wind ( @xmath231 ) onto the accretion disk plane , then @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "let us further suppose that the true thickness @xmath234 of the wind ( between the two conical surfaces ) stays constant with @xmath156 ( i.e. @xmath235 ) . with these relations we can now estimate the net mass loss rate in the outflow . in general ,",
    "@xmath236 , where , @xmath158 is the line of sight component of the outflow velocity and @xmath237 is the area ( constant with @xmath156 ) effectively filled by the gas and defined by the projection of the section of two concentric cylinders perpendicular to the accretion disk plane , with inner and outer radii @xmath228 and @xmath238 , onto the plane perpendicular to the outflow velocity : @xmath239 sin \\phi$ ] . rearranging this expression in terms of observables ,",
