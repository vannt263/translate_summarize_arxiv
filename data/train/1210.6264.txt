    "a good example of these is the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry that plays the role for the solution of the strong cp - problem  @xcite , in which a @xmath1-angle appears in the qcd lagrangian , @xmath2 , and cp is violated are the @xmath3 gauge fields with @xmath4 and @xmath5 . ]",
    "the instanton solution to the gluon field equations satisfies @xmath6 with @xmath7 s being integers and representing topological charges  @xcite .",
    "the qcd vacuum state hence can be parametrized as @xmath8 where @xmath1 is periodic with period @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore for nonzero quark masses the chiral anomaly relates the weak phase in quark masses to the qcd @xmath1-term .",
    "one can parametrize the @xmath1 angle as @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it induces a neutron electric dipole moment ( edm )  @xcite and the current experimental upper bound set the best constraint on @xmath11 to be smaller than @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this extremely suppressed quantity is called the strong cp problem . the peccei - quinn solution to the strong cp problem",
    "postulates a global chiral @xmath13 symmetry and makes @xmath11 a dynamical variable , and the shift symmetry of the nambu - goldstone boson , axion , corresponding to @xmath13  @xcite will set @xmath11 zero at classical potential  @xcite . at one - loop level",
    "the chiral anomaly will break the shift symmetry . as a result",
    "the axion is not massless but requires a small mass @xmath14  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath15 is the @xmath13 breaking scale and @xmath16 is the pion decay constant .",
    "the laboratory  @xcite and outer space  @xcite searches have set @xmath17 as the allowed regions , therefore , the axion window is @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , another small quantity that puzzles high energy physicists is the masses of neutrinos measured from neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the key point to understand neutrino physics lies on whether the neutrinos are dirac fermions or majorana fermions .",
    "this ambiguity comes from the fact of zero electric charge carried by neutrinos .",
    "the tiny neutrino masses may be explained in terms of lepton number ( @xmath19 ) symmetry which is a global @xmath20 quantum number tagged on lepton sectors in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "if @xmath21 is broken one can write the dimension-5 weinberg operator to generate neutrino masses @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath19 are the sm higgs and the left - handed lepton fields respectively , and @xmath24 is the breaking scale of @xmath21 . in this case",
    "neutrinos are regarded as majorana fermions .",
    "however , the majorana or dirac nature of the neutrinos is unknown and is awaiting for the experimental determination from some lepton number violating processes such as the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "it is important to consider the possibility that dirac neutrino masses may also connect with some global symmetry and how those small quantities we observe in physics are related to each other . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple dirac neutrino mass model which is generated by pq symmetry breaking , and hence the neutrino masses are closely related with axion mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we propose the dirac mass model which is embedded with pq symmetry . section  [ sec:3 ] we consider leptonic rare decays and neutrino oscillations data to investigate the parameter space of the model . some phenomenological implications",

    "one example is to take the pq charges as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we found it is a generic feature of assigning the large ratios of the pq charges for some particles in order to bridge the two global symmetries nontrivially . ] .",
    "two higgs doublets are introduced since the existence of the pq - symmetry and one need two independent chiral transformation for the up - type and down - type fermion , that is , one scalar doublet @xmath35 couples to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while the other one @xmath38 only couples to @xmath39 by setting opposite pq charges to doublet scalars .",
    "we consider the scenario that neutrinos are dirac fermion , with three right - handed neutrinos @xmath40 assigned to our model , and hence the theory is lepton number conserved . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43-singlet charged scalars , and @xmath44 is the axion field which is the nambu - goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken @xmath13 .",
