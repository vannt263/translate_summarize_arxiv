    "over more than two decades the momentum and spin structure of single partons in the nucleon has been investigated by now , preferentially using charged leptons as probe(s ) .",
    "a great variety of measurements , performed in fixed - target and collider experiments , turned quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) from a candidate theory into the widely accepted field theory of strong interactions .",
    "large enough photon virtualities @xmath0 were required to successfully test the abilities of perturbative qcd to describe short - range phenomena .",
    "in contrast , the description of long - range phenomena and especially of parton correlations in hadrons , over a broad range in @xmath0 , is still in its infancy .",
    "it may be expected that contemporary theoretical developments will at some moment evolve into a calculable field theoretical description of hadronic structures .",
    "it is hence vital to maintain in this process a permanent confrontation of theoretical ideas to measurements .",
    "+ in this paper possible ways are discussed how to acquire in the future adequately precise experimental data to test different approaches and to eventually be able to select the correct method describing hadronic structure on the basis of fundamental interactions .",
    "deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) continues to be a very successful tool to explore perturbative qcd . on the one hand , a wealth of inclusive data from ` unpolarized ' fixed - target and collider experiments at cern , desy and fnal allowed a rather accurate determination of the quark distributions @xmath1 through precise qcd fits of the unpolarized nucleon structure function @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the bjorken scaling variable describing the constituent s momentum fraction in a fast moving hadron . on the other hand ,",
    "results from several ` polarized ' fixed - target experiments at cern , desy and slac measuring double spin asymmetries in inclusive dis cross sections led to the determination of the polarized structure function @xmath4 with modest accuracy .",
    "although this data is limited to moderate values in @xmath0 , it constrains the contribution of the quark spin to the nucleon s helicity on the 10 - 20% level of accuracy .",
    "recent and near - future measurements at cern ( compass ) , desy ( hermes ) and jlab are changing the emphasis from inclusive dis to semi - inclusive ( sidis ) measurements .",
    "the main thrust of compass will be a determination of the polarized gluon distribution @xmath5 @xcite , over a limited range of @xmath3 with about 10% accuracy ( cf .",
    "[ fig : deltag_g ] ) .",
    "helicity distributions @xmath6 will be available from hermes , on the few % level for valence quarks and for the first time for sea quarks @xcite .",
    "a first measurement of the transversity @xmath7 @xcite , characterizing the distribution of the quark s spin in a transversely polarized nucleon , is the main goal of hermes in 2002 - 03 @xcite .",
    "accomplishing a complete understanding of the nucleon structure on the twist-2 level requires precise experimental data for all parton distribution functions mentioned above .",
    "a few years ago generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite , a set of non - perturbative distribution functions , were introduced in the description of several processes ranging from inclusive to hard exclusive scattering .",
    "gpds embody ordinary parton distribution functions and nucleon form factors .",
    "they depend on @xmath0 , two longitudinal momentum fractions and @xmath8 , the momentum transfer at the nucleon vertex .",
    "gpds can in principle be revealed from a set of different cross sections and asymmetries for various exclusive processes .",
    "the recent strong interest in gpds was stimulated by the finding @xcite that the total angular momentum carried by partons of a certain type is given by the second moment of the sum of the unpolarized gpds describing this type of partons , in the limit of small @xmath8 .",
    "the total angular momenta carried by quarks and gluons in the nucleon , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , constitute the hitherto missing pieces in the puzzle representing the momentum and spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "nowadays hard exclusive lepton - nucleon processes appear as a viable tool to access quark gpds by measuring a photon or a scalar , pseudo - scalar or vector meson in the final state .",
    "very recently , first experimental results on deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) have been obtained . the fixed - target data from hermes @xcite and clas ( jlab ) @xcite exhibit significant asymmetries in the distribution in the azimuthal angle between lepton and hadron planes , thereby confirming the expected interference between the dominating dvcs handbag diagram and the background bethe - heitler process .",
    "h1 measured the dvcs cross section at the hera collider @xcite and found agreement with qcd - based calculations @xcite .    even after completion of the present series of lepton - nucleon sidis measurements spin program @xcite will provide precise and complementary data on @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". the comparison of these measurements to sidis data will allow for very important consistency checks , in particular for a test of factorization in spin - dependent processes . ]",
    "both helicity and transversity quark distributions as well as the polarized gluon distribution will remain clearly inferior in accuracy compared to the unpolarized distributions . concerning gpds it is generally agreed that because of their complexity every attempt to really measure them will require a huge common effort of theory and experiment . +",
    "the above envisioned ` complete ' determination of the momentum and spin structure of the nucleon ( and other hadrons ) clearly calls for new experimental facilities which , in comparison to existing experiments , include    * an accelerator with a high duty factor of at least 5 - 10% allowing for hitherto unprecedented luminosities of @xmath13 @xmath14s@xmath15 or more ; * beams of electrons and , if possible , positrons with an energy definition better than @xmath16  @xmath17 and a high degree of polarization ; * beam energies above 25 - 30 gev to reach the perturbative regime of a few gev@xmath18 in @xmath0 , over the full kinematically accessible @xmath3-range ; * radiation - tolerant ( cryogenic ) solid - state targets that can achieve high degrees of longitudinal and transverse polarization ; * a spectrometer that combines very fast , @xmath16(1 - 2 ns ) triggering with high - precision tracking and full particle identification .",
    "these requirements are the basis for two proposals , tesla - n and elfe@desy , described in the addendum to the technical design report @xcite for the tesla project , a 250 @xmath19 250 gev super - conducting linear @xmath20 collider .    in the case of tesla - n @xcite",
    "it is foreseen to inject separately produced ( polarized ) electron bunches into the positron arm of the tesla machine and to extract them at one of several possible locations , thereby realizing a beam energy range between 30 and 250 gev .",
    "the ( polarized ) electrons would be directed towards a separate experimental hall . here",
    "a new experiment would combine a ( polarized ) solid - state target with a new multi - stage spectrometer required due to the large energy range of the produced particles .    in the case of elfe@desy @xcite ,",
    "separate electron bunches would be accelerated in the first part of tesla to about 30 gev , transported back and subsequently injected into the hera-@xmath21 ring .",
    "the latter would serve as stretcher to increase the low tesla duty cycle of 0.5% by a substantial factor , whereby keeping a precise energy definition of the beam . in the experiment a ( polarized )",
    "solid - state target would be combined with a new high - resolution spectrometer that will allow for a clear separation of the nucleon ground state from isobars .",
    "its projected performance is illustrated for the exclusive channel @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolelfe ] @xcite , assuming that electron and kaon were measured in the spectrometer while the missing mass of the hyperon had to be calculated .",
    "both concepts may be profitably combined : the technical solution suggested for the beam part of tesla - n in conjunction with a ( polarized ) solid - state target and a high - resolution elfe@desy - type spectrometer would be ideal to pursue the complex physics programme outlined above .",
    "this option could also be realized sharing a lower - energy , 30 - 50 gev tesla - like accelerator that is presently discussed to feed the x - ray free electron laser facility @xcite .    in the case",
    "that hera running should be extended beyond 2006 , a certain part of this physics programme could already be realized with an upgraded hermes apparatus .",
    "the envisioned luminosities of both projects , tesla - n and elfe@desy , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumi_e ] compared to existing and other possible future facilities .",
    "the planned tesla duty cycle of 0.5% is the only reason for the lower luminosity limit of tesla - n in comparison to elfe@desy . in any case a luminosity limit of a few times @xmath13 @xmath14s@xmath15 is imposed by the target cryogenic system when using a polarized solid - state target .",
    "this determines also the maximum possible luminosity for a polarized combined tesla - n / elfe@desy experiment once a duty cycle of a few % is available .",
    "note that the effective luminosity of any experiment using a polarized solid - state target , such as the polarized nh@xmath23-target of smc , is lower by a factor of about 25 compared to an electron - proton collider ( hera , eic ) or an internal - proton - target experiment ( hermes ) , due to the large dilution factors involved .",
    "this dilution effect is not included in fig .  [",
    "fig : lumi_e ] .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : deltag_g ] representative projections are shown for future results on the polarized gluon distribution . highly precise measurements as planned for     at tesla - n , based on an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath15 , in comparison to projections from compass  @xcite , hermes  @xcite and rhic  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological predictions  @xcite were calculated for q@xmath18 = 10 gev@xmath18 ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite).__,width=302 ]    rhic and proposed for tesla - n are eventually needed to map out the full @xmath3-dependence of @xmath5 with reasonable precision .",
    "the soon expected compass results ( including the not shown results from open charm production ) will provide very valuable information on @xmath5 due to their completely different systematics as compared to rhic .",
    "no projections exist up to now for the accuracy of measurements of @xmath24 .",
    "the rhic projections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag_g ] were calculated for a given final state and @xmath25 gev , i.e. for @xmath26(100 gev@xmath18 ) .",
    "they will exhibit larger error bars , when evolved down to @xmath27 gev@xmath18 . at the same time , @xmath5 will be determined from other final states and at two different energies . still , a measurement of @xmath5 at rhic is not without problems in view of the large theoretical uncertainties in direct photon and heavy quark - pair hadroproduction .",
    "hence a statistically highly precise and systematically independent determination of @xmath24 through an electron - nucleon scattering experiment is clearly needed .      in fig .",
    "[ uvaltransv-5mrad ] the projected statistical accuracy is shown for a measurement of the @xmath28-dependence of the @xmath29-quark transversity distribution through single - spin azimuthal cross - section    -quark transversity distribution as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath0 as it would be measured at tesla - n , based on an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath15 .",
    "the curves show the lo @xmath0-evolution of the @xmath29-quark transversity distribution through a fit to the simulated asymmetries ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite).__,width=287 ]    asymmetries in semi - inclusive charged pion production at tesla - n @xcite . in the simulated analysis it was assumed that transversity and helicity distributions coincide at photon virtualities of the order of 1 gev@xmath18 and valence - like @xmath3-values . fig .",
    "[ uvaltransv-5mrad ] shows that a broad @xmath3-range ( @xmath30 ) can be accessed while @xmath0 is in between 1 and 100 gev@xmath18 , with an impressive statistical accuracy over almost the full range .",
    "because of @xmath31-quark dominance in pion electro - production a lower accuracy is attained in the reconstruction of the other transversity distributions , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "measuring the transversity distributions for quarks and anti - quarks of a given flavor would allow for the first time to determine the tensor charge @xmath35 of this flavor .",
    "this would give access to the hitherto unmeasured chirally - odd operators in qcd which are of great importance to understand the role of chiral symmetry in the structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "a fit to a simulated data sample , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , also provides projections for the accuracy of the @xmath31- and @xmath36-quark tensor charges : @xmath37 and @xmath38 at a scale of 1  gev@xmath18 .",
    "note that the absolute values of the tensor charges are determined to a large extent by the input distributions used , although their values are rather close to those predicted by lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the following discussion focuses on dvcs as a tool to derive @xmath9 through the determination of gpds .",
    "hermes plans for 2004 - 2006 to use an unpolarized target in conjunction with a new recoil detector @xcite . as can be seen from the anticipated statistical precision , evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite , rather accurate data can be expected on the azimuthal dependence of the asymmetries in beam helicity and beam charge .",
    "in addition , for the first time the dependence of these asymmetries on @xmath8 , the third variable on which gpds depend , may become accessible .",
    "even a first approximate determination of the gpd @xmath39 may be tried on the basis of @xmath31-quark dominance .",
    "explicit formulae for azimuthal dvcs asymmetries on the twist-2 level are given e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite . in case of measurements with a polarized beam and an unpolarized target the generalized parton distribution function @xmath40 dominates , while the two other involved functions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are suppressed relative to @xmath40 by kinematic factors .",
    "determining through ji s relation @xcite the total angular momentum @xmath9 carried by quarks of flavor @xmath43 requires data not only on the helicity - conserving gpd @xmath40 , but as well on the helicity - flip gpd @xmath42 .",
    "access to @xmath42 may be achieved through dvcs measurements with an unpolarized beam and a transversely polarized target .",
    "also , important additional knowledge on @xmath42 can be expected from exclusive vector meson production .",
    "running with a polarized internal target is presently still technologically disfavored , because the maximum achievable instantaneous luminosity falls short by about two orders of magnitude compared to unpolarized targets . in the case of hermes running beyond 2006",
    ", a polarized target with a density improvement by about a factor of two may become available .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : tpoldvcsasy ] it can be seen that the statistical precision , achievable after three years of hermes running with an unpolarized beam and a transversely polarized target , would be sufficient to measure the azimuthal dependence of the dvcs asymmetry @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the curve depicts the behaviour of the chosen gpd parameterization ( b ) , as explained in detail in ref .",
    "note that its missing periodicity in @xmath45 is due to a particular way of integrating over one of the azimuthal angles in ref .",
    "it remains to be shown that , even using the approximation of @xmath31-quark dominance , this data set would allow simultaneous access to the gpds @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "extrapolating them to @xmath46 and simultaneously calculating the integral over @xmath3 would make it possible in principle to obtain a first glimpse of the total angular momentum carried by @xmath31-quarks , @xmath47 . however , this may not be feasible because of lack of statistics and several theoretical uncertainties that have to be quantified reliably . + a real breakthrough towards a determination of gpds",
    "can be expected only from high - statistics measurements at a future high - luminosity facility , as outlined above .",
    "a typical rather conservative assumption on integrated luminosity is 100 fb@xmath15 per year of running ( cf .",
    "as explained above , a key experiment would consist in measuring dvcs with an unpolarized beam and a transversely polarized target . in this case a typical observable would be the @xmath48 moment of the cross section asymmetry that projects out the set of gpds as discussed above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : highlumidvcsasy ] the statistical accuracy is illustrated for a measurement of dvcs in a 30 gev electron beam with a high - resolution spectrometer , combined with a nh@xmath23-target ( 80% polarization , dilution factor 17.6% ) and applying the same cuts as used in the analysis of ref .",
    "the error bars show the projected statistical    -dependence of the @xmath48 moment in a high - luminosity experiment with unpolarized electron beam and transversely polarized target @xcite , using a conical acceptance between 40 and 220 mrad.__,width=283 ]    accuracy achievable in 1 year of running for the @xmath49-dependence of the moment @xmath50 introduced above .",
    "the curve again represents the behaviour of the gpd parameterization ( b ) @xcite .",
    "the statistical errors clearly show that an acceptable precision can be reached and that even the measurement of 2-dimensional dependences ( e.g. on @xmath49 and @xmath8 ) are within reach .",
    "it remains to be shown by a careful analysis of simulated data that the ultimate goal , the above envisioned ` complete ' determination of the angular momentum structure of the nucleon , can be experimentally achieved and that the most complex variety of theoretical uncertainties can be brought under control to make this high - statistics result meaningful .",
    "in the context of the proposed tesla / fel project , a new high - luminosity high - resolution electron - nucleon facility may be accommodated . this would pave the way for a great variety of measurements , ranging from inclusive scattering through semi - inclusive final states to hard exclusive processes .",
    "on the basis of the anticipated statistical accuracies , shown for various key experiments , it appears justified to expect that many questions on the structure of hadronic matter , especially on its momentum and spin structure , can be successfully answered .",
    "it goes without saying that there will be lots of further extremely interesting physics results beyond those discussed above . among the published hermes results , after 5 years of running ,",
