    "this frequency is based on a private communication with u. litzn , who recently recalibrated the corresponding data yielding an updated value of @xmath9 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the next best wavelength calibration dates back as far as 1956 , with a value @xmath10 @xmath8 , obtained by edln and risberg using classical spectroscopy @xcite .    in the present study ,",

    "the cooling laser is a 397 nm grating stabilized diode laser ( @xmath27 mw , toptica dl100 ) .",
    "since the ions in the excited @xmath28 state have a 7% probability of decaying to the long - lived @xmath29 state , an additional diode laser at 866 nm ( @xmath30 mw , toptica dl100 ) is used for repumping .",

    "the ion cloud is imaged onto a pinhole to remove background radiation and scattered light from the electrodes , and its fluorescence is detected on a photomultiplier tube ( pmt , philips xp2020q ) .",
    "the cooling laser is spatially filtered by a single - mode optical fiber ( reducing the effective cooling laser power to @xmath30 mw ) , before being focused into the trapping region .",

    "such a crystallized ion cloud is used for the spectroscopy to minimize doppler broadening .",
    "laser cooling is performed with the cooling laser set at detuning @xmath32 mhz from resonance ( locked to a wavemeter ( atos model lm-007 ) within @xmath33 mhz ) , which is approximately half the natural linewidth .",
    "the achieved temperature is typically @xmath34 k. this is higher than the doppler limit of @xmath35 mk , probably due to anharmonicity of the applied electric field or other trap imperfections @xcite .",

    "the fluorescence due to the spectroscopy laser is recorded during these periods .",
    "a diode laser at 794 nm ( toptica dl100 ) is frequency doubled to the 397 nm to probe the transition . to minimize heating of the cloud",

    "in addition , by monitoring the cooling laser induced fluorescence , ion loss from the probed region can be observed during the scan .",
    "the probe laser is calibrated on an absolute frequency scale by referencing it to a frequency comb @xcite .",
    "a frequency comb laser is characterized by two frequencies : the repetition frequency @xmath42 which determines the mode spacing , and the carrier - envelope offset frequency @xmath43 , that gives the comb its offset from zero frequency .",

    "an interference beat note is generated between the spectroscopy laser and the comb laser modes , by overlapping the near - infrared fundamental output of the spectroscopy laser with the output of the frequency comb laser .",
    "the comb light is spectrally filtered using a grating and curved mirror in a 2f configuration ( fig .",

    "the scan over the transition was repeated at a different locking frequency of the carrier envelope offset frequency in order to determine the sign of @xmath43 . in order to calibrate the laser frequency",
    "the mode number @xmath52 still has to be determined .",
    "the most accurate measurement up to date for the @xmath0 transition in ca@xmath6 has an uncertainty of @xmath53 mhz , which complicates assigning the mode number @xmath52 with confidence .",
    "this is solved by repeating the measurement at two different comb repetition frequencies , sufficiently far apart to distinguish between the adjacent mode numbers . as the transition frequency is independent of the used comb repetition rate ,",

    "the spectroscopy signal is corrected for this ion loss .",
    "since the cooling is insufficient to reach the natural linewidth of the transition , a voigt profile , i.e. a convolution of a gaussian and a lorentzian is fitted to the data .",
    "the width of the lorentzian is fixed to 22.4 mhz @xcite , the natural linewidth of the transition .",
    "the width of the gaussian component is fitted , and typically on the order of @xmath55 mhz . from this fitted value an ion cloud temperature of @xmath56 k",
    "is deduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] ) .",
    "the mode number is determined by measuring the transition frequency using different frequency comb repetition rate of @xmath57 mhz and @xmath58 mhz .",

    "the zeeman shift in the involved energy levels ( @xmath72 ) results in a magnetic field dependent shift in the transition frequency of @xmath73khz/@xmath41 t for the @xmath74 transitions . for perpendicular magnetic field components",
    "no shifts of the line center , but only broadening can be expected to first order . these are therefore not considered .    the line center of the transition as a function of the applied external fields was recorded for three different polarizations : right- and left - circular ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively ) and linear ( @xmath75 ) . the result is shown in fig .",

    "linear fits to the data show zeeman coefficients of @xmath76khz/@xmath41 t and @xmath77khz/@xmath41 t for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 components .",
    "the deviation of the latter from the calculated value can be attributed to an inaccurate control of the polarization in the interaction region , due to depolarization by the brewster angled vacuum windows . for excitation with linear polarization , a first order zeeman coefficient of @xmath78 khz/@xmath41 t is expected , and it was correspondingly measured to be @xmath79 khz/@xmath41 t .",
    "therefore the final calibration of the @xmath0 transition is based on an average over the measurements with linear polarization . in this case , for all applied magnetic fields , the zeeman shift is smaller than @xmath80 khz @xmath81 mhz .",
