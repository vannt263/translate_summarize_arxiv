    "the motion of non - overtaking particles in narrow channels are known as single - file diffusion . in such one dimensional geometry the motion of any particle is hemmed by its neighbors . as a result the particles can not bypass each other and keep their initial order the same over time .",
    "study of such restricted motion of particles have been started by harris @xcite and jepsen @xcite .",
    "they showed that when the particles evolve according to hamiltonian dynamics the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of a tagged particle [ also called tracer particle ( tp ) ] grows diffusively , whereas for brownian particles the msd of a tp grows subdiffusively .",
    "recently , several experiments have been able to observe tp diffusion by passive microrehology in zeolites , transport of colloidal particles or charged spheres in narrow circular channels @xcite .",
    "such experimental evidences have generated a great revival of interest in tagged particle diffusion .",
    "many different results regarding the tagged particle diffusion have been reported for various systems with differently organized dynamics @xcite .",
    "for example , in addition with the mean position and the msd of the tp , probability distribution functions ( pdf ) associated with particle displacements have been studied as well @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest system where tagged particle diffusion has been studied in detail is the simple exclusion process ( sep ) .",
    "this process is usually defined on a one dimensional lattice , where each lattice site is occupied by one hardcore particle or it is empty . in every small time interval @xmath2 ,",
    "each particle moves to the neighboring site on the right with probability @xmath3 and on the left with probability @xmath4 iff the target site is empty .",
    "the hardcore interaction among the particles plays dramatic role in the long time asymptotic growth of msd of a tagged particle . in the absence of bias ( @xmath5 ) , the mean squared fluctuation of the displacement of a tp grows subdiffusively as @xmath6 for large @xmath0 where the prefactor @xmath7 is given explicitly in terms of particle density @xmath8 as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand when there is non - zero bias @xmath10 , the msd grows diffusively as @xmath11 for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "similar results have also been proved for another interesting interacting and widely studied many particle system called the _ random average process _ ( rap ) first introduced by ferrari and fontes @xcite . in rap particles",
    "move on a one dimensional continuous line in contrast to sep where hardcore particles move on a lattice .",
    "each particle moves to the right ( left ) by a",
    "_ random fraction _ of the space available until the next nearest particle on the right ( left ) with some rate @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus the jumps in either direction is a random fraction @xmath14 of the _ gap _ to the nearest particle in that direction where the random number @xmath15 is chosen from some distribution @xmath16 . as a result",
    "the particles in rap also never overtake each other keeping their initial order unchanged over time as in other single - file motion .",
    "the rap appears in a variety of problems like the force propagation in granular media @xcite , in porous medium equation @xcite , in models of mass transport @xcite , models of voting systems @xcite , models of wealth distribution @xcite and in the generalized hammersley process @xcite . in the unbiased ( @xmath17 ) case",
    "the msd of a tp in rap also grows subdiffusively as @xmath18 whereas it diffuses as @xmath19 in the globally uniform bias ( @xmath10 ) case for large time @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the prefactors are computed exactly in terms of particle density @xmath8 and the moments of the jump distribution @xmath16 @xcite . in single - file motion ,",
    "the movements of individual particles become in general strongly correlated because any large progressive displacement of a given particle in one direction also necessarily requires large displacements of more and more other particles in the same direction . in the context of rap , such correlation between positions of two tagged particles have been computed explicitly in terms of their label separation @xmath22 and time @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath23 represents the position of the @xmath24-th particle , then for large @xmath0 , the correlation function @xmath25[x_j(t ) -\\langle x_i\\rangle(t ) ] \\rangle$ ] is given by the following scaling form @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the first and second moments , respectively , of the jump distribution @xmath16 and the superscript ` gb ' indicates ` global bias ' .",
    "note that the scaling function @xmath29 is independent of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the global bias .",
    "naturally a question arises : what happens if the system is locally biased instead of globally biased ?",
    "more precisely , if a single particle in rap moves asymmetrically while all others are moving symmetrically , how does the msd grow with time ?",
    "how correlated are the positions of two particles ? in this paper we address these questions .",
    "motion of single driven tracer particle ( dtp ) in the pool of other non - driven interacting ( hardcore interaction with the tracer particle and among others ) particles have been studied in various contexts . in experimental studies ,",
    "single driven tracer in quiescent media have been used to probe rheological properties of complex media such as dna @xcite , polymers @xcite , granular media @xcite or colloidal crystals @xcite .",
    "some practical examples of biased tracer are a charged impurity being driven by applied electric field or a colloidal particle being pulled by optical tweezer in presence of other colloid particles performing random motion . on the theoretical side ,",
    "situations have been considered where the surrounding medium is a symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) and the tagged particle is a hard - core tracer driven towards a preferred direction . in this context",
    "the effect of the biased tracer has been quantified in terms of both the tracer motion and the perturbation of the density profile  @xcite .",
    "contrary to what happens in higher dimensions  @xcite , the velocity of the tracer moving in a 1d ssep vanishes  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that the perturbation of the density field of the bath particles generically consists in a denser region in the front and a depleted region at the back of it as expected intuitively .",
    "the amplitude of the difference between the density profiles in the biased and the unbiased case , decays to zero exponentially as one goes far from the driven tracer on both sides in 1d .",

    "note that in the above three equations the density @xmath8 appears as an overall factor .",
    "this is because the dynamics is invariant under a rescaling of the position variables @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , we expect that @xmath8 will appear only as an overall factor in different average quantities _",
    "e.g. _ in mean positions , in correlation functions etc . since the gap variables @xmath78s are equal to @xmath79 , the scaling functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 associated with @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , are related by @xmath84 .",
