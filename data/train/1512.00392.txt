    "the electron charge density at the small cyclotron energy such as @xmath91  mev is localized in the qd and slightly distributed into the contact area to the leads as is seen in ( a ) .",
    "the charge localization leads to charging of the qd system from both leads .",

    "mev the charge density is further distributed outside the qd and a circular charge current emerges around the dot , due to the lorentz force , as is shown in ( c ) . as a result , the net charge current is enhanced compared to the case of lower cyclotron energy .",
    "so , the electrons in the presence of the external static magnetic field are affected by the lorentz force which shrinks the electron charge distribution towards the quantum dot , but does not localized it in the dot .",
    "when we couple the qd system to the photon cavity , the first - excited state in the bias window , shown in ( b ) , is not active anymore , but instead photon replicas of it are active .",

    "the contribution of photon replica states enhances the net charge current because the higher states in the energy spectrum are less bound in the system .",
    "the second reason is that the photon cavity induces extra ` forces ' on the charge density in the qd system , the ` para- and the diamagnetic forces ' @xcite .",
    "the photon forces may stretch the electron charge in the central system towards the leads as displayed in ( d ) . comparing to the charge density in the absence of the photon field shown in ( a )",

    "the charge density is thus not effectively changed by the photon field as is displayed in ( e ) .",
    "the photon force includes the influences of the ` para- and diamagnetic forces ' .",
    "therefore , the net charge current in the qd system without a photon field around @xmath101  mev is almost equal to the net charge current in the presence of the photon cavity .    in the third case when the cyclotron energy is larger than the photon energy @xmath96 , the lorentz force is dominant .",
    "the contribution of the photon replica state with two photons is increased to @xmath102 while the photon replica state containing one photon is decreased to @xmath103 .",
    "blocking of the one - photon state in the transport is due to increased energy spacing between photon replicas of the states at a high cyclotron energy .",
    "the photon replica state with two photons is closer to getting into resonance increasing the net charge current comparing to that of the low cyclotron energy . on the other hand , in the presence of the photon field a suppression in the current",
    "is seen at a high cyclotron energy compared to the net charge current in the absence of the photon cavity .",
    "the reason is that the increased lorentz force induces a circular motion and collects the charge density around the qd as is shown in ( f ) . as a result the net charge current is suppressed .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically the balance of the static magnetic and the dynamical photon forces in the electron transport through a quantum dot in a photon cavity with a single photon mode . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot system is connected to external leads and the total system is exposed to a static perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the transport characteristics through the system by tuning the ratio , @xmath0 , between the photon energy , @xmath1 , and the cyclotron energy , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> enhancement in the electron transport with increasing electron - photon coupling is observed when @xmath3 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the photon field dominates and stretches the electron charge distribution in the quantum dot , extending it towards the contacts area for the leads . </S>",
    "<S> suppression in the electron transport is found when @xmath4 , as the external magnetic field causes circular confinement of the charge density around the dot . </S>"
