    "the second law of thermodynamics , explicitly in the form of kelvin postulate , puts a fundamental limit to the way in which usable work can be extracted form heat sources , and to the maximum amount of work extractable ( carnot s principle ) .",
    "in particular , kelvin postulate states that it is not possible to _ cyclically _ extract work from a _ single _ heat source .",
    "clausius postulate of the second law , which is notoriously equivalent to kelvin postulate , makes the impossibility more striking and understandable : heat can not spontaneously flow from sources at absolute temperature @xmath1 to sources at absolute temperature @xmath2 if @xmath3 .",
    "although in the macroscopic physical world the second law seems authoritatively to make the difference between what is allowed and what is forbidden , in the microscopic world it seems to be continuously violated : let s take the brownian motion or every fluctuation phenomena , for example .",
    "as stated by poincar about brownian motion  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` we see under our eyes now motion transformed into heat by friction , now heat changed inversely into motion , and that without loss since the movement lasts forever .",

    "maxwell s demon _ is based , in the end , on a idealized version of fluctuations rectification .",
    "the main difficulties with these approaches are that every macroscopic / microscopic rectifier device seems either to suffer fluctuations itself , which neutralize every usable net effect , or its functioning seems to increase the total entropy of the system , at least of the same amount of the alleged reduction , mainly because of energy dissipation and/or entropy cost in the acquisition of information needed to run the device . for a thorough historical account , see earman and norton  @xcite",
    ".    an approach to microscopic rectification that seems theoretically promising is the equivalent of the photo - electric effect with materials emitting electrons at room temperature .",
    "if we are able to collect even a fraction of the electrons emitted by these materials due to the absorption of radiation by a single heat source , then we would be able in principle to transform their flow into work and heat again , indefinitely . as a matter of fact , if _",
    "photo_-voltaic cells exist , why , * in principle * , _ thermo_-voltaic cells should not exist ?",
    "as we will explain later in details , our approach appears not to suffer from the usual limitations  @xcite .",
    "nowadays thermo - ionic materials are available that have a non negligible electronic emission at room temperature .",
    "for example , the well known ag  o  cs photo - cathode has a low work function , @xmath4ev , and a peak emission at about @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "other researchers have tried to experimentally implement similar ideas in the past ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , their results , some of which have been published in peer - reviewed journals , have not received the attention they deserve from the scientific community .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "those approaches share a common weakness : the current or the voltage produced are very small ( microscopic in some cases ) and , due to the complexity of the experimental apparatus ( including the measurement equipment ) and the complexity of the experimental conditions , it is often not possible to unambiguously decouple such a production from other sources known but not accounted for ( magnetic fields , ordinary solid state and plasma physics effects , and so on ) .    in this note",
    "we provide a very simple and neat approach to test the exploitability of the ` thermo - ionic emission idea ' .",
    "in contrast with what has been previously done in our approach we do not need complex equipments , high temperatures , as in @xcite , or any external , constant and uniform ( or not uniform ) magnetic field as rectifier device , as in @xcite .",
    "in such a way we should eliminate possible sources of spurious and not controllable electric effect , due for example to known thermo - electric phenomena , to the measurement equipment and to external magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the simplicity of our approach allows us to mathematically model its behavior with a straightforward analysis : in this way a comparison between theory and experimental results could be carried out on a solid , quantitative ground .    in a few words ,",

    "when two materials ( in our case , a metal and a semiconductor ) are physically joined , so as to establish a uniform chemical potential , that is a single fermi level , electrons are transferred from the material with the lesser work function @xmath18 ( ag  o  cs ) to the material with the greater work function @xmath19 ( metal ) . as a result",

    "thus , the contact potential is not a wall which forbids every flux of electrons through the junction metal / ag  o  cs .",
    "moreover , thermal photons with energy greater or equal to the energy gap between the fermi level and the conduction region in the semiconductor generate the accumulation of electrons in the semiconductor side , creating a further thermo - voltage across the junction : and all this is due to the contact field in the depletion region of the junction ( see fig .

    "this problem , anyway , could be completely fixed using closed , spherical capacitors , as we will see in section  3 .",
    "if a resistor of suitable ohmic resistance is placed between the plates , then a macroscopic and potentially exploitable current should be measurable",
    ".    it could be interesting to provide an estimate of the value of @xmath8 obtainable and an estimate of the time needed to reach such value , given the physical characteristics of the capacitor and the quantum efficiency curve @xmath23 of the thermo - ionic material .",
    "the capacitor is placed in a heat bath at room temperature and it is subject to the black - body radiation .",
    "every plate , at thermal equilibrium , emits and absorbs an equal amount of radiation ( kirchhoff s law of thermal radiation ) , thus the amount of radiation absorbed by the thermo - ionic material is the same emitted by the plate according to the black - body radiation formula ( planck s equation ) . given the room temperature @xmath24 , planck equation provides us with the number distribution of photons absorbed as a function of their frequency .",
    "according to the law of thermo - ionic emission , the kinetic energy @xmath15 of the electron emitted by the material is given by the following equation ,    @xmath25    where @xmath7 is the energy of the photon with frequency @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the planck constant ) and @xmath28 is the work function of the material .",
    "thus , only the tail of the planck distribution of photons absorbed , with frequency @xmath29 , can contribute to the thermo - ionic emission .",
    "the voltage @xmath8 reachable with frequency @xmath30 is given by the following formula ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the inter - plates potential energy , and thus ,    @xmath33    the total number of photons per unit time @xmath34 , with energy greater than or equal to @xmath35 , emitted and absorbed in thermal equilibrium by the internal side of treated plate is given by the planck equation ,    @xmath36    where @xmath12 is the plate surface area , @xmath37 is the speed of light , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 the room temperature .    if @xmath23 is the quantum efficiency ( or quantum yield ) curve of the photo - cathode ag ",

    "( [ eq9 ] ) suggests us the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 .",
    "even if we do not know _ a priori _ how @xmath23 is , we know it to be a bounded function of frequency , with values between zero and one ; usually , the higher is @xmath26 , the closer to @xmath51 is @xmath23 .",
    "thus , independently from @xmath23 , a slight increase of @xmath47 makes the value of the planckian integral to be smaller and smaller very fast .",

    "in the rest of this section we provide a numerical solution of the above differential equation .",
    "to do so we need to adopt an approximation , however : the approximation we make consists in the adoption of a constant value for @xmath54 , a sort of suitable mean value @xmath55 .",
