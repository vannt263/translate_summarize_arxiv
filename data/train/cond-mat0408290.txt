    "the phase behavior of single component systems as particles interacting via the so - called core - softened @xmath0 potentials is receiving a lot of attention recently .",
    "these potentials exhibit a repulsive core with a softening region with a shoulder or a ramp @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these models originates from the disere of constructing a simple two - body isotropic potential capable of describing the complicated features of systems interacting via anisotropic potentials .",
    "this procedure generates models that are analytically and computationally tractable and that one hopes are capable to retain the qualitative features of the real complex systems .",
    "the physical motivation behind these studies is the recently acknowledged possibility that some single component systems display coexistence between two different liquid phases @xcite@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this opened the discussion about the relation between presence of two liquid phases , the existence of thermodynamic anomalies in liquids and the form of the potential .",
    "the case of water is probably the most intensively studied .",
    "for instance , liquid water has a maximum as a function of temperature in both density and compressibility @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed some time ago that these anomalies might be associated with a critical point at the terminus of a liquid - liquid line , in the unstable supercooled liquid region @xcite , at high pressures .",
    "this hypothesis has been supported by a varied experimental data @xcite@xcite that show that thermodynamic singularities are present in supercooled water , around @xmath1 and at atmospheric pressure . in spite of the limit of @xmath2 below which water can not be found in the liquid phase without crystallization ,",
    "two amorphous phases were observed at much lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "there is evidence , although yet under test , that these two amorphous phases are related to two liquid phases in fluid water @xcite@xcite .",
    "water is not an isolated case .",
    "there are also other examples of tetrahedrally bonded molecular liquids such as phosphorus @xcite@xcite and amorphous silica @xcite that also are good candidates for having two liquid phases . moreover , other materials such as liquid metals @xcite and graphite @xcite also exhibit thermodynamic anomalies .    acknowledging that cs potentials may engender a demixing transition between two liquids of different densities , a number of cs potentials were proposed to model the anisotropic systems described above .",
    "the first suggestion was made many years ago by stell and coworkers in order to explain the isostructural solid - solid transition ending in a critical point @xcite-@xcite .",
    "debenedetti et al .",
    "@xcite using general thermodynamic arguments , confirmed that a cs can lead to a coefficient of thermal expansion negative and consequently to density anomaly .",
    "this together with the increase of the thermal compressibility has been used as indications of the presence of two liquid phases @xcite@xcite which may be hidden beyond the homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the difficulty with these approaches is that continuous potentials usually lead to crystallization at the region where the critical point would be expected .    in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we study the effect of cs potentials in a lattice . even thought the lattice is not realistic",

    "we analyze a two dimensions lattice gas with nearest - neighbors repulsive interactions and next - nearest - neighbors attraction .",
    "the system is in contact with a reservoir of temperature and particles .",
    "we show that this very simple system exhibits both density anomaly and two liquid phases .",
    "however , instead of having a critical point ending the coexistence line between the two liquid phases as one usually would expect , it has a tricritical point .",
    "the connection between the presence of criticality and the density anomaly is also shown .",
    "the reminder of the paper goes as follows . in sec .",

    "each site interacts with its nearest neighbors with repulsive interactions and with its next - nearest neighbors with attractive interactions ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath7 where , @xmath8 represents the sum over the nearest neighbors and @xmath9 is the sum over the next nearest neighbors .",
    "our system is in contact with a temperature and particle reservoirs .",
    "the grand potential is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 contains the internal energy and the contribution due to the chemical potential @xmath12 , namely @xmath13    let us now consider the ground state properties of this model .",

    ", there is a limit chemical potential beyond which the system is in the dense liquid phase and another negative chemical potential beneath which the system is in the gas phase .",

    "the soft - core repulsion prevents the density to increase to one as the temperature is decreased .",
    "therefore , the same competition responsible for the appearance of two liquid phases leads to the density anomaly .",

    "the presence of a critical line instead of a single critical point as one could generally expect @xcite is not surprising . due to the lattice structure ,",
    "the udl is not one single phase but a region where two different phases coexist : alternating empty / full rows and alternating empty / full columns .",
    "these two phases become critical together with the dense liquid phase at the tricritical point that is also the locus the where critical line ends .",
