    "strongly interacting systems attract considerable attention because of fruitful phenomena in a new field of _ cross - correlation _",
    "physics  @xcite and their potential applicability to developing field of spintronics . theoretical study of strongly correlated systems , e.g. many - electron systems and interacting spin systems , becomes time - consuming and more difficult when one starts numerical investigation of larger systems .",
    "one reason of this difficulty is , of course , the large dimension of the hilbert space or the hamiltonian matrix of many - electron systems .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with increasing number of atoms linearly in a many - electron system and , on the contrary , that in a one electron problem ( or the density functional theory , dft ) the size of the hamiltonian matrix is proportional to the number of atoms .",
    "the second reason is the fact that the rigorousness or accuracy control becomes seriously difficult in a problem of the large hamiltonian matrix .",
    "because the width of the spectra is in proportion to the number of atoms in many cases , the energy interval between adjacent eigenenergies becomes small quite rapidly with increasing number of atoms .",
    "the short interval between adjacent eigenenergies causes the difficulty in separating of respective eigenvectors .",
    "then , for example , it is very important to obtain the precise ground state , from which all the physical quantities are derived in the ( zero - temperature ) many - electron theory .",
    "thus , one needs higher energy resolution with increasing number of atoms , but , sometimes , we do not have fast , reliable and stable calculation algorithm for large hamiltonian matrices .",
    "our main target is the calculation of the green s function matrix @xmath1 in many - electron problems ; @xmath2_{ij }   , \\label{eq : gf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are a real hamiltonian matrix and energy parameter , respectively .",
    "the suffices @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote arbitrary state such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an annihilation operator and @xmath10 is a ground state . here",
    ", we should use a positive finite parameter @xmath11 in a numerical calculation of a finite system , instead of infinitesimally small positive number .",
    "the spectral function is the important physical quantity derived from the green s function eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) .",
    "there are two possibilities for calculating eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) .",
    "one is to solve the eigenvalue problem with an eigenvalue @xmath4 , e.g. the lanczos method .",
    "the other is to solve following linear equation and to take inner product between the solution and vector @xmath12 , @xmath13 with an arbitrary energy parameter @xmath4 , e.g. the shifted cocg ( conjugate - orthogonal - conjugate - gradient ) method , a family of the cg ( conjugate - gradient ) method . in both cases , we first restrict the space dimension of states to be finite . in other words ,",
    "we assume the size of the hamiltonian matrix to be finite",
    ". then we construct the krylov subspace defined as @xmath14    in the lanczos method , orthogonalized base vectors ( lanczos vectors ) are successively generated in @xmath15 , and at the same time , the hamiltonian matrix is tridiagonalized . in a large scale calculation , one can only use a small krylov subspace , because of heavy load of computation and a corruption of the orthogonality of generated basis vectors .",
    "it is well known that the rounding error breaks down the orthogonality of the generated base vectors rapidly , when the dimension of the krylov subspace exceeds several tens .",
    "the corruption of the orthogonality causes spurious eigenvalues and , more seriously , incorrect eigenvectors .",
    "therefore , the size of the krylov subspace should be limited usually to some tens or a hundred .",
    "we developed the shifted cocg method , where the eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf2 ] ) is solved within the krylov subspace , and applied it to the one - electron tight - binding hamiltonian in the system with a large number of atoms .",
    "@xcite a set of orthogonal base is created by the iterative process of the shifted cocg method , like lanczos process , but the calculation is stable for large dimension of the krylov subspace , in contrast to the lanczos method .",
    "we must solve the eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf2 ] ) , for every scalar shift @xmath16 of @xmath17 corresponding to respective energy mesh point .",
    "the number of the @xmath16 s is as much as o(@xmath18)@xmath19o(@xmath20 ) generally , however , the most time - consuming matrix - vector operations are needed only at a single reference energy ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "then the order of the total amount of calculation is just the same as lanczos method .",
    "the reduction of the matrix - vector operation at non - zero @xmath16 are based on the fact that a power of @xmath22 is decomposed into a linear combination of powers of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , krylov subspace is invariant @xmath23 against @xmath16 . in the application of this method to the many - electron theory , because the dimension of the vectors is huge , we must take care for the total amount of base vector storage for @xmath24 , in order to satisfy the memory constraint in modern computers .",
    "we explain the innermost loop index should be the iteration step @xmath25 , for an extremely large size of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "this structure also give us following additional two merits .",
    "one is that a part of the program code can be used in the inverse iteration process to improve the ground state .",
    "another is that the calculation with the different @xmath11 can be done without time consuming matrix - vector operations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scocg ] , the basics of the shifted cocg method is explained briefly .",
    "section  [ sec : error_and_seed_switching ] is devoted to explanation of how to obtain global convergence .",
    "then we apply the shifted cocg method to an extended hubbard hamiltonian with orbital degeneracy and intra- and inter - site coulomb interactions in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] , where the size of hamiltonian matrix is equal to 64,128,064 .",
    "we calculate one - electron excitation spectra and evaluate the insulating gap . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we will conclude that the essential difficulties of numerical investigation of many - electron problems , the accuracy control ( or monitoring ) and the robustness are achieved by the present method , within the moderate amount of memory space .",
    "we explain the two points to understand the mathematics in the back ground of the shifted cocg method in appendix  [ app : math ] .",
    "the practical design of storing the huge hamiltonian matrix is discussed in appendix  [ app : storage ] .",
    "assuming that the hamiltonian is represented by using @xmath26-dimensional real matrix @xmath3 and @xmath17 is a complex symmetric matrix @xmath27 , we should solve the linear simultaneous equation of @xmath28 and its shifted equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",

    "( [ eq : ref ] ) is searched within the krylov subspace @xmath35 .",
    "the subspace @xmath35 becomes whole space at @xmath36 , and the solution becomes exact .",
    "the accuracy of the approximate solution at @xmath25-th iteration @xmath37 is evaluated by using the residual vector , @xmath38 and the iteration is stopped as soon as the norm of the residual vector , @xmath39 , satisfies the criterion for the convergence .",
    "the residual vectors are `` orthogonalized '' with respect to the non - standard `` inner - product '' @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath41 , all the relevant vectors are real and the `` inner - product '' and `` orthogonality '' reduce to standard ones , respectively .",
    "because @xmath42 s are `` orthogonalized '' , it is convenient to use them as base vectors of @xmath35 .",
    "in addition to that , owning to the `` orthogonality '' , we obtain the important theorem of `` _ collinear residual _ '' ( see appendix [ app : math ] ) .",
    "the shifted cocg method starts from the cocg method  @xcite solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ref ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 as the approximate solution at @xmath25-th iteration , the searching direction to the approximate solution at the next iteration , and the residual vector , respectively . at a reference energy",
    ", we must solve the following equations under the initial conditions , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 : @xmath49 here , we must notice the fact , in the procedure of iteration , @xmath50 can happen though @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite this can not happen in the cg method ( @xmath52 , the matrix @xmath17 is positive definite ) and the other part is perfectly identical to the cg method .",
    "a set of residual vector @xmath42 forms the `` orthogonalized '' base .",
    "this `` orthogonality '' is very important for us to understand the theorem of collinear residual .",

    "the key to the reduction of the matrix - vector operations in solving the shifted system eq .",
    "( [ eq : shifted ] ) , is the theorem of collinear residual : @xmath61 where the @xmath62 is a scalar function ( actually polynomial ) of @xmath16 .",
    "then , once @xmath63 are given , the base set @xmath64 for the arbitrarily shifted system can be obtained by using scalar multiplication .",
    "we obtain the recurrence equations that determines @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : shift : pi])@xmath19([eq : shift : p ] ) can be solved separately , due to the absence of the matrix operation .",
    "for the solution of the relatively small matrix ( @xmath69 ) , any loop structure of shifted cocg method can be applicable . however , in the many - electron theory , the dimension of the intermediate vectors is huge and then the number of intermediate vectors is restricted to some tens or hundreds . in the standard loop structure which frommer showed ,  @xcite",
    "the outermost loop index is the iteration step @xmath25 , and , all the vectors @xmath66 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for every energy mesh point @xmath16 , are required in order to start the calculation at the iteration step @xmath72",
    ". then all the energy mesh points must be fixed before the calculation starts .",
    "because the calculation at the respective energy mesh points are independent to each other , the loop structure can be transformed such that the reference system is solved with the cocg method storing the @xmath73,@xmath74 and @xmath75 , then the shifted systems are solved with stored information about reference system for each energy mesh points . here",
    "the innermost loop index is the iteration step @xmath25 . since the number of energy mesh points is larger than the number of iteration generally , the latter transformed loop structure requires smaller memory than the original one .",
    "in addition to that , we need not to prepare energy mesh points @xmath76 because all the required information related to the reference system are stored in the cocg process , the preceded part of the algorithm . then , for example , we can change the smearing factor @xmath11 freely without repeating cocg process that includes matrix - vector operations .    further reduction of the required memory is possible , with further modification of the recurrence equations for the shifted system . assuming that a real constant vector @xmath77 is an adjoint vector and taking the inner product between @xmath77 and the eqs .",

    "the calculated lowest eigenenergy converges rapidly with increase of the dimension of the subspace , but the wavefunction does not , due to the unstable orthogonality against the inevitable rounding error .",
    "next we improve the approximate eigenenergy and the wavefunction with the inverse iteration method .",
    "because the cocg process with the real arithmetics is the same as cg process , here we can use the cocg part of the shifted cocg algorithm whose loop structure is changed as in the subsection  [ sub : reconstruction ] .",

    "@xcite therefore , the intersite coulomb interaction makes the present system insulator , unlike the usual transition metal oxide where the large on - site coulomb interaction makes the system insulator .",
    "once cocg method is applied to the reference system eq .",
    "( [ eq : ref ] ) , the shifted system eq .  ( [ eq : shifted ] ) is solved without time consuming matrix - vector operations , by shifted cocg method .",
    "this notable property is due to the mathematical structure of cocg method , such that the residual vector s are forming the `` orthogonal '' base set of vectors , whose direction does not change against @xmath16 .",
    "this reduction of the matrix - vector operation extremely accelerate the calculation speed of green s function @xmath1 , keeping the robustness of cocg method .",
    "simultaneously , the accuracy of the approximate @xmath1 is easily estimated as the norm of the newly generated base vector ( residual vector ) at the latest iteration .",
    "the total accuracy of the shifted cocg method varies depending on @xmath4 , @xmath16 and @xmath97  @xcite and generally very small near the bounds of the respective spectra . in the many - electron green s function ,",
    "we are usually interested in the low energy excitations , in other words , the spectra near the boundary between affinity and ionization levels .",
    "therefore , we can calculate the green s function accurately and quickly by the shifted cocg method , in the interesting energy range .",
    "another problem in the application of the cocg method to the many - electron theory is a memory constraint due to the extremely large size of vectors and matrices .",
    "we resolved this problem with separating the cocg part for the reference system and the part for the shifted equations , changing the loop structure .",
    "this change give us the following two merits .",
    "one is a usage of the former part for improving the ground state , as is mentioned in the subsection  [ sub : eigen ] .",
    "the other is the fast calculation of changing smearing factor @xmath11 , which is just a imaginary shift .",
    "when we do not know the proper energy scale _ a priori _ , the width of the energy gap in the present paper or the proper value of @xmath11 , this merit is very important .",
    "the seed switching is a very important idea for the shifted cocg method to give global convergence , which means that the calculated solution converges everywhere in the interested energy region .",
    "because it takes much iteration steps to converge the solution especially in the middle of the spectra , sometimes we must discontinue the iteration step before obtaining global convergence . in that case",
    ", we must examine the accuracy of the result and check if the solutions in the required energy range satisfy the criterion .",
    "the applicability of the above reconstruction and the seed switching are not specific to the many - electron problem .",
    "we can apply them to the general solution of the green s function of extremely large dimension .",
    "we applied the shifted cocg method to the charge and spin order in la@xmath130sr@xmath131nio@xmath132 , where the intersite coulomb interaction , relatively small compared with on - site one , plays an important role .",
    "then we conclude the relatively small energy gap opens at the fermi energy , and the system becomes insulator , due to the intersite coulomb interaction .",
    "calculations were done at the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , the university of tokyo .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research in priority areas `` development of new quantum simulators and quantum design '' ( no.170640004 ) of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology , japan .",
    "here we explain the two important points to understand the mathematical structure of the shifted cocg methods .",
    "@xcite    one is the `` orthogonality '' of the residual vectors @xmath176 with respect to a non - standard `` inner - product '' @xmath177 , which the theorem of collinear residual is based on .",
    "on should be noticed that this `` orthogonality '' is different from the well - known `` @xmath17-orthogonality '' of the searching directions @xmath178 . because @xmath179 is a base set of @xmath180 , the `` orthogonality ''",
    "is also represented as follows @xmath181 where the over line stands for taking conjugate .",
    "therefore , the direction of @xmath60 is * uniquely * determined by above equation , for arbitrary @xmath17 , as the 1-dimensional complementary space of @xmath180 within @xmath182 .",
    "then the theorem of the collinear residual eq .",
    "( [ eq : collinear ] ) is derived from the invariance of krylov subspace against @xmath16 .",
    "another point appears in the similarity between the two eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shift : r ] ) and ( [ eq : shift : pi ] ) .",
    "representing @xmath183 and @xmath84 as @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively , we can derive the relation between two polynomials @xmath186 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : residual ] ) .",
    "this relation and the theorem of the collinear residual lead to the relation between the two polynomials @xmath187 .",
    "@xcite this relation explains the similarity between the two eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shift : r ] ) and ( [ eq : shift : pi ] ) , and the plus sign in front of @xmath16 in the latter equation .    thus the mathematical structure of the shifted cocg method consists of two structures , that of a vector space and that of a set of polynomials .",
    "the non - standard `` inner product '' in the shifted cocg method can be recognized as the conservation of the analytic property as a polynomial of @xmath16 .",
    "in investigating the properties of the many - electron hamiltonian , there is a trade - off between the speed of matrix - vector operation and the amount of the memory where the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are stored .",
    "assuming the all non - zero matrix elements are stored separately and the number of the non - zero matrix elements per each column is equal to 20 , then about 10 gb is required to store the hamiltonian in the case of present paper .",
    "that is too much for the most of modern computers . in stead , if the operation of the hamiltonian on the vectors is implemented as the summation of the respective term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_reduced_hamiltonian ] ) , then the number of operator equals to 640 , and , the memory required to store 640 operators is negligibly small compared to 10 gb .",
    "however , these 640 operators must be applied to the vectors , for single operation of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the calculation time increases , compared to the case of the all elements of the hamiltonian are stored .    for simplicity ,",
    "the fermion sign and the two particle operators in the hamiltonian are neglected hereafter , then , the difference between above two manners of storing the hamiltonian are described as follows , mathematically .",
    "we define @xmath145 as a whole vector space of the single electron state and decompose it into the direct sum @xmath188 , @xmath189 denotes orbital or spin or arbitrary combinations of relevant quantum number .",
    "consequently , the whole space where @xmath25-body hamiltonian acts is described as @xmath190 decomposing single particle operator @xmath191 as @xmath192 , @xmath193 , then the action of @xmath191 on the @xmath194 is decomposed as @xmath195 since the single particle operator @xmath191 acts on @xmath194 as @xmath196 .",
    "this decomposition is trivial but one should be noticed that the dimension of respective subspace decrease exponentially with @xmath25 as @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the number of the partition @xmath188 . in contrast , the number of the terms to be summed up increases in proportion to @xmath199 therefore , the total number of the matrix elements decrease by this decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition_of_p ] ) .",
    "extreme limit of the respective @xmath200 consists of only one dimension is corresponding to the above mentioned case of 640 operators .    in the present example of the spectral function , we choose the decomposition @xmath201 , because total @xmath202 is preserved , and consequently , the numbers of @xmath203- and @xmath204-electrons are preserved , and more , the hopping part of the present hamiltonian does not have the cross term with respect to spin .",
    "this partition of the vector space leads to more simplified partition of the operator than eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition_of_p ] ) , @xmath205 ,  @xcite where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are including the hopping term with respect to each spin and a part of on - site coulomb interaction . as a result ,",
    "the size of the memory area where the values of the matrix elements are stored is about 1 gb . actually , an extra 0.5 gb is required for storing the indexes of the place of non - zero elements , then , totally 1.5 gb is required for storing the whole hamiltonian .",
    "that is not so big for a modern computer .",
