    "although there exist many exact solutions for charged fluid spheres in schwarzschild coordinates ( see , for example , @xcite ) , we have not found in the literature similar solutions in isotropic coordinates .",
    "this may be due to the fact that in these coordinates the einstein - maxwell equations for a charged perfect fluid are reduced to a system of highly nonlinear coupled second order differential equations for both metric functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 and for the electrostatic potential @xmath91 , so the task of finding exact solutions is more involved than in canonical spherical coordinates .",
    "we believe that this search for exact solutions in isotropic coordinates is worthwile .        in this appendix",
    "we give an overview of the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method used to generate the metric and its material and electric content from a known solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "the method can be divided in the following steps that are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_schem1 ] : first , in a space wherein we have a compact source of gravitational field , we choose a surface ( in our case , the plane @xmath18 ) that divides the space in two pieces : one with no singularities or sources and the other with the sources .",
    "then we disregard the part of the space with singularities and use the surface to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space .",
    "this results in a space with a singularity that is a delta function with support on @xmath18 .",
    "the same procedure can be used with a static sphere of charged perfect fluid to generate charged disks with halos , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_schem2 ] : the sphere is displaced and cut by a distance @xmath9 less then its radius . the part of the space that contains the center of the sphere is disregarded .",
    "after the inversion of the remaining space , one ends up with a charged disk surrounded by a cap of charged perfect fluid .        if the internal fluid solution is matched to the reissner - nordstrm metric eq .",
    "( [ eq_reiss2 ] ) , the outer part of the disk will have the physical properties deduced in sec .",
