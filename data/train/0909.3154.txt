    "low - energy hadron - hadron scattering plays an important role in the understanding of non - perturbative physics of strong interaction .",
    "due to its genuine non - perturbative nature , such problems can only be studied from first principles using non - perturbative methods like lattice qcd .",
    "lscher has outlined a finite - size formalism which enables us to calculate the elastic scattering phase shifts using lattice simulations  @xcite . over the years",
    ", extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to the study on hadron - hadron scattering using lscher s formalism , both within the quenched approximations and using gauge field configurations with dynamical quarks  @xcite .    in lattice study on hadron spectroscopy and hadron - hadron scattering ,",
    "the most important physical quantity is the energy of the system which is obtained via the measurements of various correlation functions .",
    "however , since a quantum field theory does not conserve particle numbers in general , the distinction between single- and multi - particle states becomes an important and delicate issue in lattice calculations . in the infinite volume ,",
    "the difference is obvious since they have different kinematic behaviors : single - particle states have discrete energy eigenvalues when viewed in their rest frame while multi - particle states usually have continuous spectrum starting from the corresponding threshold .",
    "however , when performing a lattice simulation in a finite volume , all energy eigenvalues in the finite box become discrete . therefore , other means have to to be applied in order to identify the particle nature of a corresponding state .    in principle",
    ", differences between single- and multi - particle states still persist in a finite volume .",
    "for example , although both have discrete spectra , the level spacing between neighboring multi - particle scattering states becomes infinitesimally small while the level spacing between the neighboring single - particle states remains finite as the volume goes to infinity .",
    "however , it is difficult to utilize this difference as a practical criteria since this requires the computation of excited energy eigenvalues in monte carlo simulations which is usually quite challenging .",
    "another method suggested by various authors is to use the so - called spectral weight as the identifier .",
    "this is the quantity which can be measured directly ( and relatively easily ) from monte carlo simulations , together with the corresponding energy eigenvalue . in a finite volume",
    ", the volume dependence of the spectral weight for a eigenstate is expected to show different behavior for single- and multi - particle states .",
    "for example , one expects the following empirical rule : the spectral weight to show little volume dependence for a single particle state ( if properly normalized ) , while for a two - particle state , it is expected to show a @xmath0 dependence where @xmath1 being the size of the cubic box .",
    "this expected difference in volume dependence can be measured in lattice simulations by performing the same calculation in two distinct volumes . as an example , this strategy has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the possible penta - quark state . using this technique",
    ", the authors concluded that the expected penta - quark ( single - particle ) states measured in their lattice calculations are in fact kaon - nucleon two - particle scattering states .",
    "however , this conclusion is not so settled even in the first - principle lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the volume dependence of the spectral weight indeed can provide us useful information about the particle nature of the corresponding state .    in a previous model study",
    ", we have shown that the above mentioned empirical rule to distinguish single- and multi - particle states are in fact only valid for stable particles and narrow resonances . using a solvable model , the lee model",
    ", we showed that this rule is violated for broad resonances  @xcite .",
    "a general formula for the spectral weight was obtained which can show either single- or two - particle volume behavior depending whether the width of the resonance is narrow or broad .    in this paper , we attempt to generalize this conclusion that we obtained in the lee model , to the case of general massive quantum field theory . for this purpose , the general lscher s formalism is adopted . in previous studies",
    ", people have been focusing mainly on the energy eigenvalue ( which directly enters the famous lscher s formula ) of the system within lscher s formalism",
    ". however , since the spectral weight @xmath2 of a given state is intimately related to the overlap of the exact energy eigenfunction with the free scattering states , we have to study the wavefunction of a energy eigenstate in a finite volume . in this paper ,",
    "our study focuses on the wavefunction in the @xmath3 sector and a formula for the spectral weight is thus obtained within the non - relativistic quantum mechanics model . by studying the volume dependence of the spectral weight in the large volume limit , we arrive at the same conclusion as we drew from the previous lee model study .",
    "then , following lscher s arguments , this result is generalized to massive quantum field theory .",
    "our results also show a possibility of extracting the resonance parameters from the spectral weight function on various volumes .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly review the quantum - mechanical model in the infinite volume . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_torus ] , the quantum - mechanical model is studied on a three - dimensional torus of size @xmath1 . in this section ,",
    "we derive the relevant formulae for the spectral weight function and study its volume dependence .",
    "it is found that similar conclusion is reached as in our previous study using the lee model .",
    "we then argue that , under the same restrictions as in lscher s formula , our results found in the quantum - mechanical model can be generalized to massive quantum field theory .",
    "the possibility of extracting resonance parameters from spectral weight is also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] , we will conclude with some general remarks .",
    "details on the evaluation of a function @xmath4 are listed in the appendix .",
    "consider a quantum mechanical model whose hamiltonian is given by : [ eq : hamiltonian ] h= -12m^2+v(r ) , where the potential @xmath5 is zero for @xmath6 with some @xmath7 .",
    "we now discuss the energy eigenstates satisfying : @xmath8 .",
    "one can expand the eigenfunction in terms spherical harmonics : ( r)=_lm(r)y_lm(n ) .",

    "where @xmath11 being the energy eigenvalue of the state .",
    "it is well - known that , there exist only one solution to the radial schrdinger equation that is bounded near the origin .",

    ", we impose the condition : [ eq : normalize_u ] _",
    "r0 r^-lu_l(r;k)=1 , and the solution to the radial schrdinger equation then has the form : _",
    "lm(r)=b_lmu_l(r;k ) , with some constant @xmath13 to be fixed by other conditions ( normalization , boundary conditions , etc . ) .    in the region @xmath6 where the interaction vanishes",
    ", the solution @xmath12 are expanded in terms of spherical bessel functions : [ eq : ul_expand ] u_l(r;k ) = _ l(k)j_l(kr ) + _ l(k)n_l(kr ) .",

    "for example , we have : _",
    "l(k ) a_l k^2l+1+o(k^2l+3 ) , ( ) .",
    "we now enclose the system we discussed in the previous section in a large cubic box and impose the periodic boundary condition in all three spatial directions .",
    "the potential itself is also modified to @xmath23 by periodically extending over the whole space : @xmath24 . for later convenience ,",
    "we define the the so - called  outer region \" as : = \\{r : |r+nl|>a , n^3}. this is the region where the potential vanishes identically . we assume the size of the box is @xmath1 which is much larger than any of the physical scale in the system .",
    "in particular , we need to have @xmath25 so that the outer region admits free spherical wave solutions ( asymptotic states ) .",
    "we now would like to study the change in the energy eigenvalues , the corresponding wave - functions and their possible connections with the scattering phase shifts in the infinite volume .",
    "our discussion here will focus on the case of a cubic box whose relevant symmetry group being the cubic group @xmath26 .",
    "generalization to an arbitrary rectangular box can be performed easily by changing the symmetry group to the corresponding ones ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 , etc . ) .",
    "since the boundary condition breaks rotational symmetry explicitly , we anticipate that energy eigenstates of the system will not have a definite angular momentum in general . to be specific",
    ", the original eigenstate in the @xmath19-wave will acquire mixtures from higher angular momentum modes ( mainly @xmath29 for a cubic box ) .",
    "however , since the original radial wave - function @xmath12 and the spherical harmonics forms a complete set in the functional space , we may still expand the true eigenfunction in the box in terms of them : [ eq : eigenfunction_exact ] ( r;k)=_lm b_lmu_l(r;k ) y_lm(n ) . where the coefficients are to be determined by boundary conditions and normalization .    in the outer region @xmath30 ,",
    "the solution are those singular , periodic solutions for the helmholtz equation .",
    "thus we may write : ( r;k)|_r=_lmv_lmg_lm(r;k^2 ) . in the meantime , the outer solution can also be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and the spherical bessel functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 : [ eq : expand_ylm ] g_lm(r;k^2)=(-)^lk^l+14 , the explicit expression for @xmath33 is given in ref .",

    "here we have used the wigner s @xmath34-symbols and @xmath35 . the zeta function @xmath36 is defined as : [ eq : zeta_def ] z_lm(s , q^2)= _",
    "n y_lm(n ) ( n^2-q^2)^s . from the analytically continued formula ,",
    "it is obvious from the symmetry of @xmath26 that , for @xmath37 , the only non - vanishing zeta functions at @xmath38 are : @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that @xmath19-wave and @xmath41-wave mixes with each other in a cubic box . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath19-wave eigenfunction .      in the remaining part of this paper",
    ", we will be only concerned with the energy eigen - functions in the @xmath3 sector , which is the analogue of @xmath19-wave in a cubic box .",
    "a good approximation for the @xmath19-wave dominated eigenfunction can be written as a superposition of @xmath18 and @xmath29 spherical harmonics with the @xmath19-wave component much larger than that of @xmath41-wave . to explicitly construct this type of wave - functions",
    ", we notice that the eigen - function in @xmath3 sector has to be invariant under cubic symmetries .",
    "it is easy to verify that , there are only two homogeneous harmonic polynomials which are invariant under cubic symmetry up to @xmath42",
    ". they can be conveniently expressed as : y_00=1 , y_40 + 14(y_4,4+y_4,-4 ) = 154(x^4+y^4+z^4 - 35 r^4 ) .",
    "so , we may write the eigen - function in @xmath3 sector as : [ eq : psi_a1 ] ^(a^+_1)(r;k ) = b_00u_0(r;k)y_00 + b_40u_4(r;k)(y_40 + 14(y_4,4+y_4,-4))+ , with @xmath43 in the large volume limit .",
    "in other words , to ensure cubic symmetry , the general coefficients @xmath13 at @xmath29 with different @xmath44 values must have definite ratios . in the outer region , using relation  ( [ eq : ul_expand ] ) , we have : [ eq : psi_in_out ] ^(a^+_1)(r;k)|_r & = & b_00[_0j_0(kr)+_0n_0(kr)]y_00(_r ) + & + & b_40[_4j_4(kr)+_4n_4(kr ) ] ( y_40 + 14(y_4,4+y_4,-4 ) ) + .",
    "on the other hand , we know that , in the outer region @xmath30 , the eigen - function can also be expanded into singular periodic solutions of helmholtz equation . since @xmath45 with @xmath46 being rotationally invariant , we see that in order to keep the eigen - function invariant under cubic symmetry , we must have the combination : @xmath47 in the expansion .",

    "[ eq : psi_into_glm ] ^(a^+_1)(r;k)|_r= ( 4k ) v_00 .",

    "similarly , for the higher angular momentum functions , we have : [ eq : g_expand ] g_40 & = & k^54 , + g_4,4+g_4,-4 & = & k^54 , in the above expansions , we have also utilized the following properties of the matrix elements @xmath53 : m_lm;lm=m_lm;lm = m_l ,- m;l,-m.    note that in the expansion of @xmath49 and @xmath54 in eq .",

    "when we construct the combination @xmath57 , the terms with @xmath55 cancel out explicitly since : @xmath58 which can be checked by looking into table  e.1 in ref .",

    "these four equations can be viewed as a set of homogeneous linear equations for the four coefficients : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "demanding a non - trivial solution to exist requires the corresponding determinant of the @xmath68 matrix to vanish .",
    "another simple way to proceed is to divide the second equation by the first and similarly divide the fourth one by the third .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the volume dependence of the spectral weight function which is accessible in monte carlo lattice simulations . motivated by our previous study in the lee model",
    ", it is expected that the spectral weight function shows little volume dependence for a stable or narrow resonance while for a broad resonance , it exhibits a typical @xmath0 dependence , the same as a two - particle scattering state . to verify this scenario , lscher s formalism is adopted .",
    "it is first shown in a quantum mechanical model and then generalized to any massive quantum field theory , assuming that the polarization effects are exponentially suppressed following lscher s arguments .",
    "in particular , we expect this scenario to be true also for qcd which governs the scattering of hadrons and therefore our result is relevant for lattice qcd simulations .",
    "our final result for the spectral weight is summarized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_formula ] ) which exhibits either single- or two - particle volume dependence depending on the value of @xmath109 where @xmath102 is the physical width of the resonance and @xmath107 is the typical level spacing near the resonance in the finite volume .",
    "possibilities of using the formula to extract the width of a resonance is also discussed .",

    "to study the normalization of the wavefunction @xmath86 in the large volume limit , we define the function : f(k^2)=1l^3_pf(p^2)^2-k^2 , where we have introduced a cutoff function @xmath95 .",
    "the relevant function appearing in the normalization condition  ( [ eq : v00_f ] ) is given by the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath110 : f(k^2)=1l^3_pf(p^2)(p^2-k^2)^2 .",
    "we now follow the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the value of @xmath4 for arbitrary value of @xmath110 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "we separate the summation into two parts with : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "p,|p^2-k^2|<1p^2-k^2 & = & 1l^3^_n=-1 p^2_+np^2-k^2 + & = & -l^3p^2 , where @xmath114 is the value of @xmath115 that is closest to @xmath110 ; @xmath116 is the typical level spacing between neighboring @xmath115 values which can be estimated by : 2p^2 = 1 l^3p^2=(2)^2 therefore we obtain : f(k^2)=(k^2)-k4 .",
    "since it is easy to verify that : f(k^2)=z_00(1;q^2)2 ^ 3/2 l _ 0(k ) , where we have utilized the approximate relation ( lscher s formula ) : _",
    "0(k)=z_00(1;q^2)^3/2 q. we therefore seem to have : @xmath117 in which case we recover the dewitt s formula : _ 0(k)=-(k^2-p^2_p^2 ) .",
    "if one evaluate @xmath113 explicitly , one gets : ( k^2)=p = 4 + 2k|-k+k| , with a sharp momentum cutoff @xmath118 .",
    "this expression indeed goes to zero if we drop the constant term and taking @xmath119 .",
    "consequently we have for the function @xmath120 : [ eq : fprime ] f(k^2 ) & = & -18k+ k4p^2 ^2 + & = & 18k_0(k ) + k4p^2 ^ 2_0(k ) , where in the second line we have used dewitt s formula . since @xmath121 , we find that @xmath122 in the large volume limit .",
