    "in the standard model ( sm ) , electroweak symmetry breaking , whereby the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons and the quarks and leptons acquire mass , gives rise to a higgs boson , @xmath14 . however , the value of @xmath15 is quadratically sensitive to the cutoff scale of the theory , @xmath16 , especially through top quark loops which give a one - loop correction of ^2=-34 ^ 2 ^ 2v^2 ^ 2 , where @xmath16 is the high energy cutoff and @xmath17 . for @xmath16 of order",
    "the gut scale , @xmath18 , or the planck scale , @xmath19 , an extreme cancellation between the one - loop contribution(s ) and the bare higgs mass is required in order that the physical higgs mass be below a @xmath20 , as required in order for the scattering of longitudinally polarized @xmath12 bosons to obey unitarity in a perturbative fashion .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models , such as the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , cure this naturalness / hierarchy problem associated with the quadratically divergent 1-loop corrections via the introduction of superpartners for each sm particle .",
    "because the spin of the superpartners differs by 1/2 unit from that of the corresponding sm particle , the 1-loop correction from the superpartner will cancel that of the sm particle once the energy scale being integrated over in the loop is above the mass of the ( presumed to be heavier ) superpartner .",
    "so long as the superpartners have mass somewhat below @xmath21 ( say @xmath22 ) , the cancellation is not particularly extreme and the hierarchy / naturalness problem associated with the quadratic divergences is ameliorated .",
    "however , there remains the question of how finely the gut - scale parameters must be adjusted in order to get appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking , that is to say correctly predict the observed value of @xmath23 .",
    "it is here that lep limits on a sm - like higgs boson play a crucial role .",
    "supersymmetric models most naturally predict that the lightest higgs boson , generically @xmath24 , is sm - like and that it has a mass closely correlated to @xmath23 , typically lying in the range @xmath25 for stop masses @xmath26 , with an upper bound , for example , of @xmath27 in the mssm for stop masses @xmath28 and large stop mixing . if the stop masses are large , the predicted value of @xmath23 is very sensitive to the gut scale parameters",
    ". such sensitivity is termed fine tuning. models with minimal fine tuning provide a much more natural explanation of the @xmath13 mass than those with a high level of fine tuning .",
    "the degree of fine tuning required is thus quite closely related to the constraints on a sm - like @xmath24 , and these in turn depend on how it decays .",
    "the sm and the mssm predict that @xmath5 decays are dominant and lep has placed strong constraints on @xmath29 . the limits on ( hbb )",

    "one concludes that @xmath30 is excluded for a sm - like @xmath24 that decays primarily to @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , because of the manner in which the analysis is done , at a first level of approximation this limit applies for an @xmath24 that decays to any combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 channels making up the rest ) @xmath37",

    "the remaining part of mssm parameter space either has at least one very large parameter , most typically a soft - susy - breaking stop mass close to a tev at scale @xmath23 , or else large mixing in the stop sector . in the former case",
    ", one always finds that to predict the observed @xmath23 requires very careful adjustment ,  fine - tuning , of the gut - scale parameters with accuracies better than 1% . in the latter case , fine - tuning",
    "can be reduced to the 3% level . to achieve small fine - tuning ,",
    "let us say no worse than 10% , the soft - susy - breaking parameters that affect the higgs sector should be well below a tev , in which case the lightest cp - even mssm higgs boson would have mass @xmath40 .    as suggested in @xcite , the simplest way to allow a higgs mass of order @xmath0 , thus making possible a light susy spectrum and low fine - tuning ,",
    "is to modify higgs decays so that the @xmath31 branching ratio is small and primary decays are to channel(s ) to which lep is less sensitive .",
    "this is very natural in models in which the higgs sector is extended and higgs to higgs decays are kinematically allowed .",
    "the decay widths for higgs to higgs decays can easily exceed the very small width for the @xmath31 channel .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric model that gives rise to this possibility is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) .",
    "the nmssm yields a preferred value of @xmath6 purely on the basis of minimizing fine - tuning .",
    "a higgs mass near @xmath0 is also strongly preferred by precision electroweak measurements .",
    "further , there is a well - known @xmath41 excess in the @xmath42 channel in the lep data for @xmath43 when a final state that contains two or more @xmath44 is assumed to contain exactly 2 @xmath44 .",

    "meanwhile , there are no current limits on the @xmath64 final state for @xmath65 @xcite . and limits in the case of @xmath66 run out at slightly lower @xmath48 . as already stressed and as described below in more detail , we are particularly led to the above interpretation of lep data since fine - tuning within the nmssm is absent for model parameters that yield precisely this kind of scenario @xcite . while various alternative interpretations of this excess in terms of a non - sm higgs sector have been suggested  @xcite , the nmssm scenario has the lowest fine tuning of any such scenario and has particularly strong theoretical motivation .",

    ", the scalar component of @xmath68 naturally acquires a vacuum expectation value of the order of the  breaking scale , giving rise to a value of @xmath67 of order the electroweak scale .",

    "the particle content of the nmssm differs from the mssm by the addition of one cp - even and one cp - odd state in the neutral higgs sector ( assuming cp conservation ) , and one additional neutralino .",

    "the black crosses show @xmath123 as a function of @xmath165 after requiring only that the scenario be theoretically consistent , but before any experimental constraints whatsoever are imposed .",
    "the most important components of the theoretical consistency are : ( 1 ) that the vacuum corresponds to a proper electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum at a true minimum of the potential ; and ( 2 ) that the couplings remain perturbative during evolution up to the gut scale .",

    "the blue - square points now show a very strong preference for @xmath222 , even before , but especially after , focusing on minimal @xmath123 .",

    "for example , in the case of @xmath49 tuning of the gut - scale parameters needed to achieve appropriate @xmath256 and @xmath257 is likely to be minimal for scenarios in which the @xmath87 is about 10% non - singlet at the state - mixing , amplitude level ,  1% at the probability level .",

    "then , the mass of the lightest cp - odd higgs boson in the simplest approximation is given by : @xmath262 we see that the @xmath256 contribution to @xmath201 is suppressed relative to the @xmath257 contribution for small @xmath263 and large @xmath7 and an appropriate balance between the contributions is naturally achieved .",
    "in @xcite , we defined a measure called @xmath264 that encapsulates the amount of tuning at the gut scale that is likely to be needed to achieve small @xmath201",

    "we have shown that there is a portion of nmssm parameter space with an abundance of attractive features , no outstanding problems and which leads to an important set of predictions that should be taken quite seriously .",
    "there are many ways in which the nmssm is a better benchmark theory than the mssm , since it has important flexibilities that are currently leading to problematical issues for the mssm .",
    "the attractive features of the nmssm include :    a natural explanation for the @xmath67 parameter is provided  since all superpotential couplings are dimensionless in the nmssm , the scale of @xmath67 is given by the scale of soft - susy - breaking , which ( see below ) can be well below a tev ;    the supersymmetric context provides a highly satisfactory solution of the naturalness / hierarchy problem if the squark masses ( in particular , the stop masses ) and the gluino mass are well below a tev ( implying possible discovery at the tevatron and very plentiful production at the lhc ) ;      low squark masses imply that the lightest higgs boson , the @xmath86 , will most naturally be sm - like in its couplings to sm particles and have a mass of order @xmath0 , close to the ideal value for satisfying precision electroweak constraints ;    lep data is fully consistent with such an @xmath86 provided it decays mostly via @xmath444 ( requiring @xmath394 ) or @xmath445 ( when @xmath273 ) , where the @xmath87 is primarily the cp - odd component of the extra complex scalar higgs singlet field ;        the optimal scenarios fit nicely with choices for the gut - scale values of the soft - susy - breaking higgs masses squared and @xmath83 parameters that are quite modest in size , as might be associated with an approximate no - scale model for susy breaking ;    in the natural scenarios above , the heavier higgs bosons of the model ( two cp - even and one cp - odd neutral higgs bosons and the charged higgs boson ) have relatively modest masses that would make them accessible at a hadron collider if @xmath7 is large enough and mostly accessible at a 1 tev linear @xmath451 collider ;      the @xmath87 could allow for adequate annihilation in the early universe of very light neutralinos @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of this scenario suggests that the lep groups should push a re - analysis of the @xmath453 channel in the hope of either ruling out the @xmath454 scenario , or finding an excess consistent with it for @xmath165 in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "either a positive or negative result would have very important implications for higgs searches at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we also stress that @xmath181 factory experiments should attempt to search for a @xmath455 signal down to the lowest possible branching ratio ( the predicted minimum in the nmssm context being of order @xmath456 ) .",
    "we speculate that similar results could emerge in other supersymmetric models with a higgs sector that , like the case of the nmssm , is more complicated than that of the mssm .",
    "many such models can be constructed .",
    "thus , much of the discussion above regarding higgs discovery is quite generic . in general",
    ", there might be quite a few light @xmath8 s , all of which could appear in the decay of a light sm - like @xmath24 and all of which would provide potential signals in reanalyzed lep data and in @xmath457 decays . there is a potential gold - mine of discovery if one digs deeply enough .    however , whether the @xmath8 is truly the nmssm cp - odd @xmath87 or just a lighter higgs boson into which the sm - like @xmath24 pair - decays , hadron collider detection of the @xmath24 in its @xmath1 decay mode will be very challenging .",
    "discovery modes that one can hope to demonstrate to be viable include :        diffractive production @xcite , @xmath461 , with @xmath460 .",
    "this latter mode looks very promising @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it seems very doubtful that viable discovery signals would be possible for the analogous modes with @xmath462 ( that would be the only ones available if @xmath463 ) .",
    "although @xmath464 is somewhat preferred by naturalness arguments in the nmssm case , one should be prepared for the possibility that the lhc will discover a plethora of supersymmetric particles , and perhaps some heavy higgs bosons ( if @xmath7 is large enough ) but fail to see the sm - like light higgs most closely associated with electroweak symmetry breaking . the only lhc evidence for its existence",
    "would then be that @xmath208 scattering would be found to be fully perturbative , as predicted if there is a light @xmath24 with sm - like couplings to @xmath208 .    at a linear collider , detection of @xmath465 production",
    "using the @xmath466 missing mass @xmath467 approach will be completely straightforward .",
    "a @xmath0 @xmath24 with sm coupling to @xmath152 will result in many events forming a sharp peak in @xmath467 , quite independently of how the @xmath24 decays .",
    "the decays can then be analyzed to see what is present and with what branching ratio .",
    "detection of an @xmath24 with unexpected decays at a photon collider will also be reasonably straightforward @xcite .",
