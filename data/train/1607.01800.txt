    "the internal motions of galaxies are largely set by dark matter , which outweighs baryonic matter by at least five to one .",
    "a key goal of galaxy astrophysics is to relate the visible and dark mass in any given system , which to first order means determining the correlations between the structural parameters of galaxies ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and hubble type @xmath5 ) and those of dark matter haloes ( e.g. @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "this programme requires extensive observation of the rotation and velocity dispersion profiles of galaxies and their baryonic mass distributions , combined with detailed dynamical modelling under a variety of assumptions about the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "traditional summaries of the relation between the baryonic mass distributions and internal motions of galaxies relate 1-point statistics of these functions , reducing the former to a total galaxy mass and size , and the latter to a single measure of velocity .",
    "these are the tully ",
    "fisher , mass  size and faber  jackson relations , along with the fundamental plane .",
    "more information , however , can be found in the full _ radial _ dependence of mass and velocity , and analysis of this dependence may be expected to afford not only a more stringent test of specific galaxy formation models , but also a richer foundation for a bottom - up determination of the galaxy  halo connection .    the local correlation of dark and visible matter is usefully described by the ratio of enclosed dynamical mass ( determined kinematically ) to enclosed baryonic mass ( determined photometrically ) . a proxy for this quantity is @xmath9 , to which it is equal in the case of spherical mass distribution .",
    "@xmath9 is known as the `` mass discrepancy ''  @xcite , and will be denoted @xmath10 hereafter . in general , @xmath10 may be any function of position @xmath11 within a galaxy , with parametric dependence on global galaxy properties @xmath12 ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the full functional form of the mass discrepancy , @xmath13 , is a kinematic parameterization of the relation between dark matter and baryons , and _ a fortiori _ of the galaxy  halo connection .    while in principle @xmath10 may have an arbitrary dependence on position , its utility is significantly enhanced by the fact that it is known to correlate strongly with acceleration @xmath14 in all galaxies in which it has been measured in detail  @xcite",
    "this allows us to focus our attention on @xmath15 , which is known as the `` mass discrepancy  acceleration relation '' or mdar .",
    "the tightness of this relation and its inclusion of information across a galaxy s profile may be expected to make it among the most useful scaling relations for constraining models of the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "the value of the mdar relative to 1-point summaries , regardless of tightness , may be approximately established by a simple counting argument : while the latter are limited to one data point per galaxy , the former contains as many data points as one can measure across the entirety of a galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct a framework for using the mdar to test galaxy formation models , and hence deduce the dynamically - relevant correlations of the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "although the mdar has been known observationally for decades , few studies have sought to systematically extract the information contained within it .",
    "the tightness of the relation is used by some to argue against all @xmath0cdm - based models of galaxy formation  @xcite , where stochasticity in the galaxy  halo connection may be expected to introduce a significant scatter into the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath16 . in addition",
    ", it is argued that the presence of a `` characteristic acceleration '' @xmath17 at which @xmath10 consistently becomes @xmath18 ( indicating a dynamically - insignificant quantity of dark matter ) is not compatible with standard galaxy formation . a generic galaxy ",
    "halo connection would predict a spread in @xmath10 at high @xmath16 , and no clear transition in acceleration space between the dark matter and baryon - dominated regimes .",
    "other authors , however , claim that the salient features of the mdar arise naturally in @xmath0cdm models which have been tuned to match the tully ",
    "fisher  @xcite or @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 relations  @xcite , and consensus concerning the relation s significance does not seem at hand .",
    "furthermore , no study to date has systematically investigated the dependence of @xmath10 on global galaxy properties ( @xmath12 ) at fixed @xmath16 , or quantified the dependence of mdar residuals on @xmath11 .",
    "our specific task is twofold .",
    "first , we create a set of statistics to quantify four significant features of the mdar : its shape , its scatter , the presence of a `` characteristic acceleration , '' and the correlation of its residuals with other variables ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is motivated in part by the prevalence of purely qualitiative claims in the literature concerning the compatibility of the mdar with various models , from which it is difficult to determine the exact degree or nature of the agreement .",
    "our statistics enable the conversion of verbal assertions into precise statistical comparisons , and we hope that they will sharpen future discussions of the mdar regardless of theoretical perspective .",
    "the salience of these statistical features , however , is best appreciated in the context of specific model expectations .",
    "our second task , therefore , is to develop a semi - empirical framework in @xmath0cdm to generate predictions for the mdar .",
    "we adopt a fully bottom - up methodology , beginning with the simplest and best motivated correlations between galaxy and halo variables , and introducing more when required by the data .",
    "an empirical approach is preferable to the use of a specific model in this case as it affords transparency concerning the correlations of galaxy and halo properties responsible for particular aspects of the predictions , provides model - independent information about the galaxy  halo connection , and ensures tight enough control over the model systematics for statistical tests to be meaningful .",
    "by comparing the predicted and observed mdars we will deduce the extent to which semi - empirical models are able to account for the significant features of the relation , and the concrete extensions to basic models that are required to match the relation s more detailed features .",
    "we intend in this way to lay the groundwork for a phenomenological determination of the galaxy  halo connection from information - rich relations such as the mdar , as well as formulating precise tests for specific models .",
    "the starting point of our framework is the technique of halo abundance matching ( am ) , which imposes a nearly monotonic relationship between galaxy stellar mass and halo mass or velocity at a particular epoch  @xcite .",
    "mocks based on am have been shown to agree well with clustering and satellite fraction measurements  @xcite , and , at least to first order , with 1-point galaxy scaling relations  @xcite . from a phenomenological perspective , am specifies the relation between stellar mass and halo mass and concentration required to fit observations , but in its basic form neglects gas mass as well as galaxy size and type .",
    "we therefore augment the model by allowing correlations of these variables with @xmath6 and @xmath7 at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "for a given set of correlations constituting the galaxy  halo connection , we generate a large number of mock data sets from our theoretical population with baryonic properties identical to the real data and halo properties specified by the model .",
    "we then calculate the mdar statistics of these mock data sets , and evaluate the models by asking whether the observed values of the statistics could plausibly have been drawn from the mock data distributions .",
    "the mdar is considered by some an important piece of evidence in favour of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) as an alternative to @xmath0cdm for solving the missing mass problem , and is a central relation in mond phenomenology ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the founding papers of mond were the first to predict that @xmath10 would be more tightly correlated with acceleration than velocity or galactocentric radius  @xcite , a hypothesis not verified empirically for many years . in mond , the mdar is a direct manifestation of the breakdown of newtonian gravity or mechanics at low acceleration @xmath22 , with the result that it is predicted to have no intrinsic scatter , residuals systematically uncorrelated with any other variable , and a clear acceleration scale @xmath23 . while the mond mdar must go to 1 at @xmath24 ( the newtonian regime ) and has a shape fixed by the theory at @xmath25 ( the deep - mond regime ) , the behaviour at intermediate @xmath16",
    "is specified by an _",
    "ad hoc _ interpolating function .",
    "our statistical analysis will shed light on the compatibility of the observations with the mond hypothesis , and our comparison with @xmath0cdm models will bring into sharper focus the relative evidence accorded to mond and @xmath0cdm by the relation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe our observational mdar sample and the n - body simulations on which we build our theoretical framework . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we lay out our procedure for constructing the galaxy  halo connection and document the mdar statistics with which we evaluate our models . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our comparison of theory and data , first for a fiducial model best motivated by prior analyses , and then allowing variations in our model assumptions to maximise agreement with the mdar .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses previous mdar studies in the context of our results , locates our parameter constraints and model requirements relative to previous findings , and elaborates on the broader implications for our understanding of galaxy astrophysics .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "we take the observational mdar from the sparc sample  @xcite , a recent compilation of @xmath26 high - quality resolved rotation curves augmented with spitzer @xmath27 photometry .",
    "this sample spans a wide range in all dynamically - relevant galaxy properties ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and hubble type s0 to im / bcd ) , making it ideal for our analysis . following the suggestion of  @xcite",
    ", we remove galaxies with quality flag @xmath31 ( indicating major asymmetries , non - circular motions , and/or offsets between the stellar and hi distributions ) and those with inclination @xmath32 degrees , which may be subject to large systematic uncertainties in their rotation curves .",

    "the mdar of the final sample of 153 galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "our theoretical framework is based on dark matter haloes from a simulation in the darksky simulation suite  @xcite .",
    "the darksky suite assumes a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "here we use the darksky-400 simulation ( ` ds14_i_4096 ` ) , a @xmath38 box with @xmath39 particles and mass resolution @xmath40 , run with the 2hot code  @xcite .",
    "this simulation was previously used in the studies of  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "haloes were identified using the rockstar halo finder  @xcite , and a merger tree was constructed using the consistent trees code  @xcite .",
    "we construct a series of empirical models of increasing complexity for the effective galaxy  halo connection of the sparc sample .",
    "we begin with the standard am ansatz that the only galaxy property that correlates with halo mass and concentration is stellar mass .",
    "we then consider the possibility that the sparc galaxies inhabit a systematically biased subset of the total halo population , the potential for correlation between halo concentration and galaxy size at fixed stellar mass , and finally the impact of disk formation on the halo density profile . to test the models we use them to generate a large number of mock mdar data sets with galaxy properties identical to the real data , but halo properties specified by the model .",
    "for each mock data set , we calculate a series of statistics based on important features of the mdar , which we then compare to the values derived from the real data .",

    "3 .   a crossover occurs at @xmath100 , beyond which the simulated measurements lie below the observations in both @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this shows that standard am ( with moderate halo expansion ) readily accounts for the baryon - domination of high - acceleration regions , and furthermore that variations in the dark matter content among galaxies at high @xmath16 are naturally small .",
    "in fact , it is seen from the @xmath101 and @xmath102 columns of table  [ tab : table1 ] that the predicted @xmath92 and @xmath93 are both @xmath103 too _ low _ in the @xmath104 bin , which implies at face value that high - acceleration regions ought to possess more dark matter than allowed for by our fiducial model .",
    "although the quoted measurement uncertainties in the sparc data ( @xmath105 per cent in @xmath106 ) are too small to reconcile the measured values with the theoretical expectations , there exist additional uncertainties due to disc inclination , mass - to - light ratio , distance , and three dimensional baryon structure ( personal communication , f. lelli ) . taken together , these could account for the discrepancy in @xmath107 and @xmath108 , but would exacerbate the overprediction of @xmath109 and @xmath89 .",

    "[ fig : fig6b ] and column 4 of table  [ tab : table2 ] ) , indicating a _ greater _ degree of regularity in the acceleration beyond which dark matter becomes dynamically irrelevant .",

    "we see from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5a ] , as well as columns 5 and 6 of table  [ tab : table2 ] , that many more mock galaxies have @xmath63 than observed , but fewer have @xmath63 .",

    "we first consider the possibility of reducing the predicted mdar scatter by decreasing the am scatter : the results of a model with am scatter = 0 are shown in the @xmath95 row of tables  [ tab : table1][tab : table3 ] .",
    "this has a negligible effect on the statistics characterising the shape and scatter of the relation , indicating that @xmath93 originates almost entirely from the spread in @xmath10 values generated by haloes of fixed proxy ( due to scatter in @xmath6 and @xmath7 at fixed @xmath124 ) , rather than the spread in proxy values at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "that @xmath109 and @xmath89 are significantly overpredicted even without any scatter in the galaxy  halo connection demonstrates the extraordinary tightness of the mdar .",
    "since am scatter = 0 is in any case ruled out by clustering  @xcite , however , we will not consider this model further . as in  @xcite",
    ", we find also that the effect of varying @xmath82 within the limits set by clustering measurements is small and does not significantly impact any of our statistics .",
    "we therefore conclude that varying the am parameters can not substantially improve the mdar prediction .",
    "we explore next the effect of modifications to the halo density profile due to disk formation , as parameterized by @xmath83 .",
    "the excessive value of @xmath112 in the fiducial model , in addition to @xmath117 being too low , suggests that the degree of halo expansion corresponding to @xmath125 is insufficient .",
    "we therefore show in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5b ] and row 4 of tables  [ tab : table1][tab : table3 ] the results of changing @xmath83 to @xmath126 , roughly the lowest value deemed plausible by  @xcite .",

    ", we show in the @xmath96 row of tables  [ tab : table1][tab : table3 ] the results of a model with standard adiabatic contraction ( @xmath127 ) . in accordance with many studies in the literature",
    ", this clearly generates an excess of dynamical mass within the regions probed by kinematic measurements .",
    "the scatter in the theoretical mdar may be more efficiently reduced by imposing a correlation between galaxy morphology and halo concentration , effectively situating the late - type sparc galaxies in haloes less concentrated than average . as described in section  [ sec : model ] , this may be achieved by removing at each stellar mass some fraction @xmath84 of the highest concentration haloes before assigning haloes to the mock galaxies .",
    "the blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] show the mean mdar and its dispersion when the 80 per cent of highest concentration haloes at each stellar mass are removed from the theoretical parent population ( i.e. @xmath128 ; see also the @xmath102 row of tables  [ tab : table1]-[tab : table3 ] ) .",
    "this is found to be the approximate value required for the predicted @xmath112 and @xmath109 to be consistent with that observed . by reducing mass discrepancies across the mdar",
    ", this modification to the effective host halo population also reduces @xmath62 and @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , both @xmath113 and @xmath114 are increased .",
    "this occurs because lower concentration galaxies have relatively more dark matter mass at large radius , while the rotation curves of galaxies with higher gas or stellar mass tend to be probed out to larger radii in the data .",
    "hence the average @xmath10 of high @xmath2 and @xmath3 galaxies are increased relative to those with low values .",
    "this effect corresponds also to a large increase in @xmath117 , bringing it into agreement with the observed value .",
    "we discuss this model further in section  [ sec : problems ] .    as an alternative selection model",
    ", we report in row 7 of tables  [ tab : table1]-[tab : table3 ] the case in which each sparc galaxy is required to occupy a distinct halo that is not located inside the virial radius of a larger halo .",
    "we find a moderate reduction in both @xmath92 and @xmath93 across the acceleration range , showing that subhaloes have larger @xmath10 on average .",
    "changes to @xmath76 are small , and there is a negligible difference in statistics pertaining to the characteristic acceleration scale . in terms of its effect on the mdar ,",
    "this is a middle ground between the fiducial model of section  [ sec : fiducial ] and the @xmath128 model described above .",
    "none of the model alterations examined so far have had a significant impact on @xmath116 ( table  [ tab : table3 ] , column 4 ) , which has remained in all cases at least @xmath129 too high .",
    "this indicates that larger galaxies at fixed stellar mass ought to reside in less massive haloes than have been assigned by the model , i.e. that @xmath4 as well as @xmath2 ought to correlate with halo @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "we anticipated this possibility with the size  concentration correlation model described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath130 , and tune @xmath85 until the discrepancy in @xmath116 is removed .",
    "we find @xmath131 for the observed value of @xmath116 to lie within the 95 per cent confidence interval of the theoretical prediction , and display the best - fitting case @xmath132 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3][fig : fig7 ] and row 8 of tables  [ tab : table1]-[tab : table3 ] .",
    "this result suggests that in principle there is sufficient information in the mdar to determine the correlation of galaxy size with halo properties at fixed stellar mass .",
    "this correlation has two further consequences .",
    "first , since a galaxy of given size can no longer occupy a halo with any concentration , the spread in @xmath10 is lowered , leading to a reduction in both @xmath109 and @xmath89 .",
    "these remain in disagreement with the observed values , however , even when the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath90 is made very tight .",
    "this suggests that the spread in @xmath6 alone at fixed @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 overpredicts the mdar scatter .",
    "a second consequence of setting @xmath133 is that @xmath114 is reduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7c ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath4 and @xmath3 are correlated at fixed @xmath2 : larger galaxies have lower surface density and hence a lower star formation rate and greater ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath2 . reducing @xmath10 for larger galaxies",
    "therefore reduces it also for more gas - rich galaxies , so that @xmath116 and @xmath114 shift together . in particular ,",
    "when the predicted @xmath116 agrees with the observations , @xmath114 is @xmath134 too low .",
    "although this discrepancy is not statistically significant , taken at face value it suggests that more gas - rich galaxies ought to be assigned more massive haloes than gas - poor galaxies at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this could be achieved by abundance matching on total baryonic mass rather than stellar mass .",
    "future analyses along these lines will determine whether this modification is necessary .",
    "we discuss the @xmath135 correlation further in section  [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "there have been few theoretical studies of the mdar , and none to the level of detail presented here .",
    "those that do discuss the relation either use it to argue that @xmath0cdm - based models must not be able to account for the detailed dynamical properties of galaxies  @xcite , or , in reaction to such claims , that the relation does emerge from basic assumptions concerning galaxy formation  @xcite . by means of detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the relation and its quantitative agreement with specific assumptions for the galaxy  halo connection , we intend our work to break this impasse and achieve a non - binary appreciation of the relation s significance . in this section",
    ", we discuss the mdar literature in light of our results",
    ". a recurring theme will be the assertion that a given model `` can fit the mdar '' or `` can not in principle fit the mdar , '' where in fact the associated analysis warrants only the conclusion that it can or can not fit one particular mdar statistic  and even that not established quantitatively .",
    "a series of papers  @xcite argue that the mdar poses a serious fine - tuning problem for all @xmath0cdm - based galaxy formation models .",
    "in particular , it is claimed that neither the tightness of the observed mdar nor the bottoming out of @xmath10 at high @xmath16 can be accounted for .",
    "we confirm that the small scatter of the mdar is a serious problem , although in our analysis the discrepancy is not as severe as suggested for example by fig . 3 of  @xcite .",
    "this is because  @xcite considers as _ a priori _ plausible correlations between galaxy and halo variables that violate the assumptions of abundance matching ; we on the other hand contend that the success of am in matching to first order both clustering and kinematic statistics implies that the constraint it imposes on the galaxy  halo connection must obtain in any plausible galaxy formation scenario .",
    "that models inconsistent with the am stellar mass  halo mass relation lie off the mdar need not argue for a fine tuning problem with @xmath0cdm .",
    "they may instead be interpreted as a success of am .",
    "further , we do not find low values of @xmath10 at high @xmath16 to be problematic ; indeed , given an amount of halo expansion compatible with the tully  fisher and faber  jackson relations , our models predict a _",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath136 than is found in the data .",
    "we find in addition that the @xmath16 values at which @xmath10 becomes small ( in our case , @xmath64 ) are no less uniform in mock data than real data , and are clustered around a comparable central value .",
    "this success derives from the stellar - to - halo mass fractions of am , combined with halo expansion and realistic galaxy sizes and baryonic mass profiles .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath66 adequately capture the meaning of the terms `` acceleration scale '' or `` characteristic acceleration , '' we conclude that if present in the data these are present also in the mocks . that the acceleration scale of dark matter is around @xmath137 is perhaps not so surprising if we consider that the average dark matter density is an @xmath138 multiple of @xmath139 , which is proportional to @xmath140 .    nevertheless , many of the claims of  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite are borne out by our investigation .",
    "not only are are @xmath92 , @xmath109 and @xmath89 naturally overpredicted , they remain so under highly conservative assumptions about galaxy formation , including no scatter in the galaxy  halo connection and a significant reduction in the spread of halo concentrations associated with a galaxy of fixed @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the details of the transition region from baryon to dark matter domination ( as quantified by @xmath59 and @xmath58 ) are not understood , and @xmath10 is indeed compatible with being a function of @xmath16 alone ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "our analysis therefore serves to refine and focus questions concerning the compatibility of the mdar with concordance cosmology .",
    "@xcite are concerned in part to show that galaxy formation scenarios with correct phenomenology in other respects must fit the mdar .",
    "they present a model with feedback parameters tuned to match the tully  fisher relation , among others , and use it to generate 40 mock galaxies which they sample at regular intervals to produce a theoretical mdar .",
    "they find that @xmath10 is a tighter function of @xmath16 than @xmath11 or @xmath142 , and that it tends to 1 at high @xmath16 .",
    "they claim on the basis of these results that the model successfully exhibits a `` characteristic acceleration scale . ''",
    "although our study qualitatively agrees with several results of  @xcite , we believe their claim of success to be too strong  such a conclusion could only be supported by a statistical analysis in which a mock data set with all the important features of the observed mdar is not extraordinary given the parent galaxy  halo population .",
    "in particular , claiming success for _ any _ reasonable model precludes using the relation to constrain models , which we believe we have shown to be both possible and fruitful .",
    "@xcite examine the mdar of galaxies produced in several cdm and wdm hydrodynamical simulations , and conclude that the predicted and observed relations are incompatible .",
    "this conclusion is supported by an application of the wilcoxon signed rank test , which quantifies the agreement of the ranks of @xmath10 in the observed and simulated data at given @xmath16 .",
    "although this test clearly demonstrates that the expected mdar is on the whole normalised too high ( a conclusion corroborated here ) , we caution that it need not be considered as decisive as the authors claim : since @xmath10 is reduced to its rank , a simulated mdar consistently lying only slightly above the observations will appear as incompatible with them as one lying much higher , despite the fact that uncertainties in either data set may suffice to make them fully compatible according to any goodness - of - fit test that uses @xmath10 directly .",
    "furthermore , the failure of individual simulations does not imply impossibility within the simulational framework .",
    "we suspect in addition that  @xcite use mond mass - to - light ratios , which have no justification in @xmath0cdm .",
    "nevertheless , we concur that the scatter in the expected mdar is on the whole too high , and for the reasons given : there is a large spread in halo properties for given baryonic properties .",
    "we have placed this discrepancy on firm numerical footing , and furthermore brought to light the conditions required for a quantitative solution . whether or not such conditions may be reasonably achieved by hydrodynamical simulations in @xmath0cdm remains to be seen .",
    "@xcite construct a semi - empirical model for the mdar using average galaxy scaling relations from observations and halo scaling relations from n - body simulations .",
    "although similar in spirit , our methodology improves upon that of  @xcite in several ways : we use an am model that matches clustering measurements , we consider selection effects and correlations of halo variables with galaxy properties besides stellar mass , we give mock galaxies @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 values identical on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis with the data and sample their rotation curves at the same radii , we take the correlations between halo variables directly from a state - of - the - art n - body simulation rather than approximating them by power - laws with fixed log - normal scatter , and finally we make quantitative comparisons . while a confirmation of the qualitative results of  @xcite with updated measurements is valuable ,  @xcite do not investigate the relation in sufficient detail to claim that all its pertinent aspects arise in @xmath0cdm .    finally ,  @xcite compare the observed mdar to that of 22 galaxies generated by the magicc and clues hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "although the shape and scatter of the relation can not be quantified with such a small sample , both seem to be in approximate agreement with the observations . with reference to analyses of this type ,",
    "we argue that an empirical framework which offers complete transparency concerning its constituent elements provides a better handle on the aspects of the galaxy  halo connection responsible for important features of the predicted mdar .",
    "nevertheless , hydrodynamical simulations will produce correlations between galaxy and halo variables that lie outside our parameterizations , making a direct comparison with the mdar valuable and complementary to our approach .",
    "we hope that future comparisons will utilise the statistics we have developed .",
    "the mdar imposes several interesting constraints on am - based galaxy formation models in @xmath0cdm , and provides evidence concerning a number of important correlations of the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "we discuss these issues here .",
    "first , in agreement with  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , the observed @xmath10 values fit more comfortably with expanded than contracted haloes : a high value of @xmath83 ( such as that corresponding to standard adiabatic contraction ) degrades the fit for the majority of our statistics .",
    "we find little sensitivity to the am parameters within the ranges allowed by clustering measurements , although more generally the tightness of the mdar argues for a small am scatter .",
    "we find no evidence from @xmath113 for deviations from the am stellar mass  halo mass relation , and at best weak evidence from @xmath114 that am based on total baryonic mass would perform better than the conventional stellar mass - based scheme . in addition , the agreement of @xmath115 with our fiducial model suggests that galaxies of different hubble type at fixed @xmath2 do not reside in haloes with markedly different dynamical properties .",
    "we note however that the sparc sample does not include any true early - type galaxies , and hence we can not use this statistic to rule out the scenario in which the haloes of galaxies earlier than s0 differ substantially from those later .",
    "the small offset between the mdars of galaxies with the same stellar mass but different size requires at the @xmath1 level that lower surface brightness galaxies be placed in less massive or less concentrated haloes than is allowed for by standard am .",
    "we have constructed a simple toy model for such a relation , and found that the observed value of @xmath116 implies an average correlation @xmath145 , with @xmath131 ( 95 per cent confidence ) and best - fit value @xmath132 .",
    "the weakness of this correlation lends justification to the assumption used in many semi - analytic and empirical models that galaxy size is uncorrelated with halo properies at fixed @xmath2 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and indeed models that make this assumption yield approximate agreement with observed @xmath146 correlations ( e.g. the tilt of the fundamental plane in the case of  @xcite and  @xcite ) while those that impose strong @xmath135 or @xmath147 correlations _ a priori _ do not ( e.g. the correlation of velocity and size residuals in  @xcite ) .",
    "we stress however that the correlation between galaxy size and halo properties has important dynamical consequences and no strong prior ( indeed , it is predicted by the celebrated  @xcite model ) , and should therefore be explicitly considered in any galaxy formation model that seeks to explain galaxies @xmath148 scaling relations . in an upcoming paper ( desmond et al .",
    "2016 , in prep ) , we will show that the eagle hydrodynamical simulation  @xcite produces a @xmath135 correlation in approximate agreement with both mdar and tully  fisher statistics , although the velocity and size residuals remain somewhat too strongly anticorrelated .    remarkably , the `` characteristic acceleration '' at which @xmath10 becomes small is predicted to be no less uniform than that observed for all the models we consider , and hence the presence of this feature can not be used to constrain the theory .",
    "we could not find any plausible choice for the galaxy  halo connection that significantly breaks this agreement ( except perhaps the case of strong halo contraction ) .    within the context of our framework ,",
    "@xmath112 , @xmath109 , @xmath89 and @xmath117 may argue for the sparc galaxies occupying a subset of the total halo population highly biased in concentration or mass .",
    "we discuss the plausibility of such a model further in the following section .",
    "we have identified several aspects of the mdar that can not be matched  or can be matched only with extreme difficulty  in our framework .",
    "foremost among these is the scatter , which we find to be too high in the theory both at low @xmath16 ( @xmath109 ) and in an averaged sense ( @xmath89 ) , regardless of the details of the am scheme , the halo response to disk formation , and the correlation between galaxy size and halo concentration at fixed stellar mass .",
    "this is a particularly pressing problem because am imposes a tight galaxy ",
    "halo connection by construction , and there is no guarantee that a full galaxy formation theory would naturally produce a correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath124 with only @xmath149 dex scatter .",
    "indeed , the mdar scatter is overpredicted even in the case of a perfectly monotonic galaxy  halo connection , when am scatter is switched off .",
    "in addition , we have neglected observational uncertainties from disc inclination , mass - to - light ratio , distance , and three dimensional baryon structure , which would increase the intrinsic tightness of the relation still further .",
    "finally , we have been careful to ensure that there are no differences between the local baryonic properties of mock and real galaxies or the radii at which their rotation curves are sampled , both of which could artificially inflate the predicted scatter .",
    "our conclusions concerning @xmath93 ought therefore to be highly conservative .",
    "the unexpected regularity of galaxy kinematics has been noted previously in the context of the baryonic tully  fisher relation , most recently for the sparc sample in  @xcite .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to suppose that the sparc galaxies occupy a substantially biased subset of the full halo population .",
    "we find that excluding the @xmath150 per cent of haloes with highest concentration at each stellar mass reduces @xmath109 and @xmath89 to acceptable levels , in addition to mitigating the offset of the @xmath10 values of low and high @xmath11 points , as measured by @xmath117 . in line with  @xcite , it is tempting to interpret this as a correlation between morphology and host halo structure . that such a model may be fleshed out in detail , however , is doubtful , for four reasons :    1 .",
    "the sparc galaxies span the range from s0 to im / bcd , a morphological subset that accounts for @xmath151 per cent of the total galaxy population ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   even supposing one could justify discarding 80 per cent of haloes",
    ", it is implausible that these should be the exact haloes with highest concentration .",
    "a non - monotonic selection function would require a further increase in @xmath84 to be effective .",
    "when the fraction of haloes removed is constant over stellar mass , @xmath10 is also reduced for @xmath152 where it already lies below the observed values in the fiducial model . since the high - acceleration regime is mostly populated by high - mass galaxies",
    ", this would suggest that the fraction of haloes removed ought to be lower at higher @xmath2 , yet the fraction of early - types rises with @xmath2 .",
    "4 .   as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the agreement between the observed and predicted @xmath115 reveals that the average difference in the masses or mass distributions of haloes of galaxies with different morphology within the sparc sample can not be large . forcing galaxies of earlier type to inhabit more concentrated haloes would reduce @xmath115 , probably out of consistency with the data .",
    "the second most significant challenge is the excess @xmath92 predicted at low @xmath16 .",
    "this continues a long line of results indicating that the amount of dark matter in galaxies predicted by galaxy formation models applied to n - body simulations is on the whole too high , a problem which manifests itself in many and varied forms ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that while this discrepancy can be remedied in the case of galaxy 1-point scaling relations ",
    "the tully  fisher and faber  jackson relations  by means of a global halo expansion parameterized in the same way as adiabatic contraction  @xcite , the radius - dependent information in the mdar reveals that this method is inadequate in detail .",
    "no value of @xmath83 in the range that correctly predicts the tully  fisher normalisation , for example , can generate a value of @xmath112 as low as that observed .",
    "low acceleration points come from low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) and the outer regions of high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbs ) .",
    "two unique features of the sparc sample are its high proportion of lsbs and its wide range of stellar mass ( down to @xmath153 ) .",
    "tully  fisher and faber  jackson data sets , on the other hand , tend to be dominated by hsbs and extend no lower than @xmath154 .",
    "the excess mass discrepancy at low @xmath16 is largely due to low mass lsbs : these galaxies are placed in haloes that are too massive .",
    "there are hints that this would impact the baryonic tully  fisher relation were it extended to low mass  @xcite , and the discrepancy receives full expression in the too big to fail  @xcite and cusp - core  @xcite problems at the dwarf scale .",
    "potential solutions to those problems apply here also , most prominently the possibility of strong feedback .",
    "indeed , the low value of @xmath117 in the fiducial model ( indicating an excess of dark matter at low over high radii ) may also be evidence of feedback : a successful scheme would not only need to move dark matter outwards , but do so preferentially in low mass , low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "if feedback is powered by star formation , it might be thought that such galaxies ought to have a _ smaller _ impact on their haloes , although some simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) do predict such an effect .",
    "we stress however that simply reducing @xmath10 by moving dark matter outwards is not enough : the spread in @xmath10 must also be reduced , for example by homogenising the haloes .",
    "it is unclear whether this is expected .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath112 may also be alleviated by modifying the galaxies stellar masses .",
    "we have assumed that the stellar masses assigned by am are identical to those of the sparc sample , although in practice they have been derived using different assumptions for galaxy photometry , mass - to - light ratios and imf . since the am stellar - to - halo mass ratio peaks around @xmath155 ,",
    "if the galaxies at the low - mass end of the sparc sample in fact correspond to galaxies of higher stellar mass in our model then the predicted mass discrepancies would be reduced at low @xmath16 .",
    "this effect is degenerate with a modification to am which places lower mass galaxies in less massive haloes .",
    "it is also possible that extrapolating the stellar and halo mass function below their resolution limits ( @xmath154 ) could introduce systematic errors at the low-@xmath16 end of the mdar .",
    "if none of these modifications prove effective , non - standard dark matter interactions may be required ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "four more mdar statistics can not be matched at the 95 per cent level within our framework : the high - acceleration average mass discrepancy and scatter ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) and the number of galaxies within a given data set with points on either side of @xmath156 ( @xmath59 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "we doubt however that these discrepancies provide additional information on the galaxy  halo connection : @xmath107 and @xmath108 likely point to additional measurement uncertainty , and correct prediction of @xmath59 and @xmath58 may well follow from success in matching @xmath92 at low @xmath16 .",
    "since the mond prediction for the mdar has less freedom than that of @xmath0cdm , the relation offers less potential to constrain it ; on the flip - side , this makes the mond prediction easier to rule out .",
    "we note three ways in which our analysis has relevance for mond .    *",
    "_ prima facie _ ,",
    "@xmath157 at @xmath158 implies the existence of missing mass in the newtonian regime , violating a basic principle of mond .",
    "since we have shown that this is equally unexpected for am , however , it is likely due to additional measurement error .",
    "this may derive from uncertainties in disc inclination , mass - to - light ratio , distance , or the three dimensional distributions of the baryons . *",
    "absent systematic uncertainty , @xmath10 depends _ only _ on @xmath16 in mond , and hence mdar residuals may not correlate with any other variable . in our analysis , this implies @xmath159 for each of @xmath160 .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : fiducial ] , the magnitudes of each of these variables in the data are @xmath161 and hence compatible with 0 within the measurement uncertainty , supporting the hypothesis that @xmath10 is a function of @xmath16 alone .",
    "this finding is made somewhat more significant by the fact that our model predictions for @xmath162 significantly exceed 1 in some cases .",
    "* in a bayesian model comparison sense , an increase in the evidence achievable by @xmath0cdm models disfavours mond , and vice versa .",
    "we have shown that the presence of a `` characteristic acceleration '' in the mdar can not discriminate against am mocks .",
    "on the other hand , we have considerably strengthened the argument that the scatter in the relation is lower than predicted by standard galaxy formation , especially at low @xmath16 .",
    "the mdar provides a map between the distribution of a galaxy s baryonic and dark matter , and therefore contains crucial information about the galaxy  halo connection . in this paper",
    "we have laid the groundwork for extracting this information for use in evaluating models of galaxy formation .",
    "we have analysed the mdar using a set of 14 statistics that quantify its four most important features : its shape , its scatter , the presence of a `` characteristic acceleration '' beyond which mass discrepancy consistently goes to @xmath18 , and the correlation of its residuals with other galaxy properties .",
    "in addition to using these statistics to focus discussion of the observed relation itself , we have engaged them to construct a data - driven framework for the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "building upwards from the simplest case of stellar mass - based abundance matching in @xmath0cdm , we have successively incorporated selection effects , a correlation between galaxy size and halo concentration , and a mass - dependent prescription for the impact of disk formation on halo density profiles . comparing to data from the sparc sample ,",
    "our most significant findings are the following .    * a basic am model readily accounts for several features of the mdar , including its approximate overall shape , its small scatter at high acceleration , and the independence of its residuals on stellar mass . in addition , we find no grounds for the claim that the acceleration at which the mass discrepancy becomes low is more uniform in the data than is expected in theory ( a `` characteristic acceleration scale '' ) . *",
    "nevertheless , the predicted mdar has significantly too high a normalisation and scatter at low @xmath16 .",
    "this remains true under highly conservative assumptions for galaxy formation , including no scatter in the galaxy  halo connection and a significant reduction in the spread of halo concentrations associated with a galaxy of fixed @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates too much dark matter predicted in the outer regions of high surface brightness galaxies and ( especially ) in low surface brightness galaxies , and too large a variation among halo properties .",
    "in addition , dark matter is more concentrated towards the centres of galaxies than the mdar suggests .",
    "these discrepancies argue for halo expansion in response to disk formation , and a quantitative resolution requires also the exclusion of a large fraction ( @xmath163 per cent ) of the haloes with highest concentration at each stellar mass .",
    "* the mdar may be used to to detect correlations of halo properties with ( at least ) three galaxy properties at fixed stellar mass : gas mass , disc size , and hubble type .",
    "our analysis suggests at the @xmath164 level that galaxy size is anticorrelated with halo concentration at fixed stellar mass .",
    "there exists in addition weak evidence in favour of basing am on total baryonic mass rather than stellar mass , but negligible direct evidence that the haloes of early - type galaxies have systematically different properties than those of later type .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate interest in the mdar as a source of information about the galaxy  halo connection .",
    "looking forward , we identify three ways in which further progress could be made .",
    "first , additional models and assumptions need to be tested against the relation to the level of rigour achieved here .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the outputs of many hydrodynamical simulations or semi - analytic models , for example , are consistent with mdar statistics .",
    "specific implementations of the correlations of halo properties with galaxy variables besides @xmath2 ( e.g. am using total baryonic mass , or the angular momentum partition model of  @xcite ) should be tested individually .",
    "second , a firmer theoretical basis needs to be given for the empirical galaxy  halo correlations argued for by the mdar ; this may be possible by mapping hydrodynamical simulations onto phenomenological frameworks such as ours .",
    "finally , an increase in the size and precision of mdar data sets may be expected to yield a considerable gain in the constraining power of analyses of this type , pinning down the values of the statistics in the real data and reducing the widths of their distributions in the mock data .",
    "the full power of the mdar likely remains to be harnessed .",

    "<S> we analyse the mdar using a set of 14 statistics which quantify its four most important features : its shape , its scatter , the presence of a `` characteristic acceleration scale , '' and the correlation of its residuals with other galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an empirical framework for the galaxy  halo connection in @xmath0cdm to generate predictions for these statistics , starting with conventional correlations ( halo abundance matching ; am ) and introducing more where required . comparing to the sparc data  @xcite , we find : 1 ) the approximate shape of the mdar is readily reproduced by am , and there is no evidence that the acceleration at which dark matter becomes negligible has less spread in the data than in am mocks ; 2 ) even under conservative assumptions , am significantly overpredicts the scatter in the relation and its normalisation at low acceleration , and furthermore positions dark matter too close to galaxies centres on average ; 3 ) the mdar affords @xmath1 evidence for a correlation of surface brightness with halo mass or concentration . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis lays the groundwork for a bottom - up determination of the galaxy  halo connection from relations such as the mdar , provides concrete statistical tests for specific galaxy formation models , and brings into sharper focus the relative evidence accorded by galaxy kinematics to @xmath0cdm and modified gravity alternatives .    </S>",
