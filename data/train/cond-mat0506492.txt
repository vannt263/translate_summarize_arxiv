    "despite the fact that josephson junction arrays ( jja ) have been actively studied for decades , they continue to contribute to the variety of intriguing and peculiar phenomena . to name just a few recent examples , it suffice to mention the so - called paramagnetic meissner effect and related reentrant temperature behavior of ac susceptibility , observed both in artificially prepared jja and granular superconductors ( for recent reviews on the subject matter , see , e.g.  @xcite and further references therein ) .",
    "so far , most of the investigations have been done assuming an ideal ( uniform ) type of array .",
    "however , it is quite clear that , depending on the particular technology used for preparation of the array , any real array will inevitably possess some kind of non - uniformity , either global ( related to a random distribution of junctions within array ) or local ( related to inhomogeneous distribution of critical current densities within junctions ) .",
    "for instance , recently a comparative study of the magnetic remanence exhibited by disordered ( globally nonuniform ) 3d - jja in response to an excitation with an ac magnetic field was presented  @xcite .",
    "the observed temperature behavior of the remanence curves for arrays fabricated from three different materials ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) was found to follow the same universal law regardless of the origin of the superconducting electrodes of the junctions which form the array .    in the present paper , through an experimental study of complex ac magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 of the periodic ( globally uniform ) 2d - jja of unshunted @xmath0 junctions , we present evidence for existence of the local type non - uniformity in our arrays .",
    "specifically , we found that in the mixed state region @xmath4 can be rather well fitted by a single - plaquette approximation of the overdamped 2d - jja model assuming a nonuniform ( lorentz - like ) distribution of the critical current density within a single junction .",
    "our samples consisted of @xmath5 unshunted tunnel junctions .",
    "the unit cell had square geometry with lattice spacing @xmath6 and a junction area of @xmath7 .",
    "the critical current density for the junctions forming the arrays was about @xmath8 at @xmath9 , giving thus @xmath10 for each junction .",
    "we used the screening method  @xcite in the reflection configuration to measure the complex ac susceptibility @xmath11 of our 2d - jja ( for more details on the experimental technique and set - ups see  @xcite ) .",
    "fig.1 shows the obtained experimental data for the complex ac susceptibility @xmath12 as a function of the excitation field @xmath13 for a fixed temperature below @xmath14 .",
    "as is seen , below @xmath15 ( which corresponds to a meissner - like regime with no regular flux present in the array ) the susceptibility , as expected , practically does not depend on the applied magnetic field , while in the mixed state ( above @xmath15 ) both @xmath16 and @xmath17 follow a quasi - exponential field behavior of the single junction josephson supercurrent ( see below ) .",
    "to understand the observed behavior of the ac susceptibility , in principle one would need to analyze the flux dynamics in our overdamped , unshunted jja .",
    "however , given a well - defined ( globally uniform ) periodic structure of the array , to achieve our goal it is sufficient to study just a single unit cell ( plaquette ) of the array .",
    "( it is worth noting that the single - plaquette approximation proved successful in treating the temperature reentrance phenomena of ac susceptibility in ordered 2d - jja  @xcite as well as magnetic remanence in disordered 3d - jja  @xcite . )",
    "the unit cell is a loop containing four identical josephson junctions .",
    "since the inductance of each loop is @xmath18 and the critical current of each junction is @xmath10 , for the mixed - state region ( above @xmath15 ) we can safely neglect the self - field effects because in this region the inductance related flux @xmath19 ( here @xmath20 is the total current circulating in a single loop  @xcite ) is always smaller than the external field induced flux @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 is the projected area of a single loop , and @xmath23 is an applied ac magnetic field ) . besides , since the length @xmath24 and the width @xmath25 of each junction in our array is smaller than the josephson penetration depth @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the critical current density of the junction , @xmath28 is the magnetic flux quantum , and @xmath29 is the size of the contact area with @xmath30 being the london penetration depth of the junction and @xmath31 an insulator thickness ) , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( using @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath1 at @xmath36 ) , we can adopt the small - junction approximation  @xcite for the gauge - invariant superconducting phase difference across the @xmath37th junction ( by symmetry we assume that  @xcite @xmath38 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial phase difference .",
    "the net magnetization of the plaquette is @xmath41 where the maximum supercurrent ( corresponding to @xmath42 ) through an inhomogeneous josephson contact reads @xmath43 for the explicit temperature dependence of the josephson critical current density @xmath44\\tanh \\left [ \\frac{\\delta ( t)}{2k_bt}\\right ] \\ ] ] we used the well - known  @xcite analytical approximation for the bcs gap parameter ( valid for all temperatures ) , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .    in general , the values of @xmath16 and @xmath47 of the complex harmonic susceptibility are defined via the time - dependent magnetization of the plaquette as follows : @xmath48 and @xmath49 using eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) to simulate the magnetic field behavior of the observed ac susceptibility of the array , we found that the best fit through all the data points and for all temperatures is produced assuming the following nonuniform distribution of the critical current density within a single junction  @xcite @xmath50 it is worthwhile to mention that in view of eq.(2 ) , in the mixed - state region the above distribution leads to approximately exponential field dependence of the maximum supercurrent @xmath51 which is often used to describe critical - state behavior in type - ii superconductors  @xcite .",
    "given the temperature dependencies of the london penetration depth @xmath52 and the josephson critical current density @xmath53 , we find @xmath54 for the temperature dependence of the characteristic field near @xmath14 .",
    "this explains the improvement of our fits ( shown by solid lines in fig.1 ) for high temperatures because with increasing the temperature the total flux distribution within a single junction becomes more regular which in turn validates the use of the small - junction approximation .    in summary",
    ", we found clear experimental evidence for the influence of the junction nonuniformity on magnetic field penetration into the periodic 2d array of unshunted josephson junctions . by using the well - known ac magnetic susceptibility technique ,",
    "we have shown that in the mixed - state regime the ac field behavior of the artificially prepared array is reasonably well fitted by the single - plaquette approximation of the overdamped model of 2d - jja assuming inhomogeneous ( lorentz - like ) critical current distribution within a single junction .",
