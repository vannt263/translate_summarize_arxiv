    "one of the main subjects of current interest in condensed matter physics is the search for materials that host topological insulator ( ti ) phases @xcite .",

    "the first proposal of this state of matter was made by kane and mele @xcite on the basis of graphene in the presence of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "however , the relevant soi in graphene turns out to be rather small @xcite such that the effect seems to be inaccessible in experiments .",
    "this situation is different in hgte / cdte quantum wells where the qshe was also predicted theoretically @xcite and experimentally seen soon after @xcite .",
    "recently , a single layer of silicon atoms  called silicene  has been synthesized exhibiting an analogous honeycomb structure as graphene @xcite .",
    "since silicon is heavier than carbon , the spin - orbit gap in silicene is much larger than in graphene .",
    "therefore , if it was possible at some point to prepare clean silicene , it should be feasible to experimentally access the qshe in this material . similar to graphene ,",
    "the unit cell of silicene contains two atoms which gives rise to two different sublattices .",
    "in contrast to graphene , however , the silicene sublattices are found to be arranged in a buckled structure pointing out - of - plane @xcite . due to the broken sublattice symmetry ,",
    "the mobile electrons in silicene are therefore able to couple differently to an external electric field than the ones in graphene .",
    "this difference is the origin of new ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling effects that allow for external tuning and closing of the band gap in silicene @xcite .",
    "consequently , an electrically induced topological quantum phase transition is possible .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this phase transition can in principle go both ways , i.e. , whether the electric field can be used to destroy and generate the qshe . refs . @xcite",
    "clearly show that a different potential on the two sublattices of a honeycomb lattice leads to a transition from a ti to a trivial insulating state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some indications have been presented that the interplay of two silicene specific ( rashba ) spin - orbit terms can even induce the qshe starting from a trivial insulating band structure in the absence of these terms .    the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase is distinguished from a normal insulating phase by a bulk @xmath1  topological invariant @xcite . for a minimal model of the qshe in graphene ,",
    "this invariant has been analytically calculated in a seminal work by kane and mele @xcite .",
    "however , the original formulation of the @xmath1   invariant in terms of bloch functions does not contain a constructive prescription as to its numerical evaluation .",
    "subsequent work on the topological properties of the band structure of silicene was restricted to the absence of terms breaking the spin @xmath2-conservation or to employing the bulk - boundary correspondence in silicene nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "evidently , a full topological analysis of silicene is missing and , as we show below , important to clearly identify phenomenological differences between graphene and silicene . in this work ,",
    "we employ prodan s method @xcite to calculate the topological invariant without any further symmetry assumptions in a manifestly gauge invariant way to provide a conclusive analysis of the novel features of silicene regarding qsh physics .",

    "this model enables us to construct a valid hamiltonian for the full brillouin zone which is crucial for the subsequent topological analysis .",

    "the ( internal ) electric force in silicene is provided by the crystal field in in - plane and out - of - plane direction .",
    "since the momentum operator is oriented along nearest neighbor or next - nearest neighbor bonds , the silicene lattice forbids terms involving a crystal in - plane force coupling to a nearest neighbor bond .",

    "additionally , there is a regular nearest - neighbor hopping term and on - site energies of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the on - site energy of the atomic orbital and @xmath75 the hopping parameter for hopping between the orbitals @xmath21 and @xmath76 of neighboring atomic sites .",
    "when an external electric field @xmath39 is applied perpendicularly to the atomic plane of silicene , a staggered sublattice potential of the form @xmath77 is generated @xcite with a , so far , undefined parameter @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath79 allows for on - site transitions between the @xmath80 and @xmath45 orbitals @xcite .    to describe a full next - nearest neighbor tight - binding model",

    "( [ eq : hatomso ] ) , which we may index as @xmath81 here due to their resemblance to rashba terms .",

    "@xcite for details of the modeling ) . beyond the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the influence of an electric field @xmath39 applied perpendicularly to the atomic plane . a staggered sublattice - hamiltonian is then induced that takes in the basis ( [ eq : tbbasis1 ] ) the following form @xmath93 as only transitions between @xmath80 and @xmath45 orbitals of the same site are allowed @xcite . in this equation , @xmath94 is the charge of an electron and @xmath95 the stark element weighting the transition .",

    "the tight - binding model of @xmath34 and @xmath18 bands allows us to estimate some of the parameters introduced in the previous section as a function of the parameters @xmath99 ( that are in principle known ) as well as the stark element @xmath95 . to do so",
    ", we now apply a unitary transformation @xmath100 to the hamiltonian that corresponds to the following change of basis @xmath101 with mixed orbitals , for example , @xmath102 .",
    "then , the transformed hamiltonian @xmath103 can be analyzed perturbatively on the first @xmath104 block corresponding to the basis @xmath105 , which is expected to describe energy eigenstates near the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "listing only terms including the external electric field , we find in first and second order perturbation theory the following three terms @xmath106 with parameters @xmath107 in the last step , the expressions were approximated under the assumption of low buckling , meaning @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where only the term of lowest order in @xmath88 was kept .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath78 represents the on - site hopping occuring only in a buckled structure . with the one proportional to @xmath83 , an electric field induced term of first order in soi @xmath98",
    "is generated that is related to a next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "it depends linearly on @xmath88 , so this term is specific to the buckled silicene structure as well .",
    "finally , the term proportional to @xmath110 is the well - known rashba spin orbit coupling reported already in refs .",
    "all terms given above agree nicely with our previous group theoretical analysis .",
    "we now estimate the size of the spin - orbit terms coupling to an external electric field in silicene .",
    "the bond parameters @xmath99 , the energy @xmath111 , the angle @xmath112 , the lattice constant @xmath13 , as well as the spin orbit interaction @xmath98 are adapted from ref .  @xcite .",
    "we then approximate the stark - element @xmath113 as transition matrix elements between atomic wave functions , where in silicene we have @xmath114 , since the outer shells are provided by the @xmath115 and @xmath116 orbitals .",
    "the corresponding wave functions were chosen as the wave functions of the hydrogen atom with the same quantum numbers .",
    "we then find @xmath117 in silicene , where @xmath118 is the bohr radius and an outer electron experiences an effective atomic charge of @xmath119 @xcite due to screening .",
    "hence , we estimate @xmath120 . for typical values of @xmath121",
    ", we calculate @xmath122 thus , the additional term proportional to @xmath83 is small compared to the term proportional to @xmath78 , but similar in magnitude as the kane - mele - rashba term proportional to @xmath110 .",
    "triggered by the theoretical prediction @xcite and experimental discovery @xcite of the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect , the study of topological effects in the physics of bloch bands has been a major focus of condensed matter physics in recent years @xcite .",
    "the qsh state is a bulk insulating state featuring metallic edge states that are protected by time reversal symmetry . due to kramers",
    "theorem , these edge states appear in so called helical pairs .",
    "the bulk energy gap in the original proposal for the qsh effect in graphene by kane and mele @xcite is due to an intrinsic soi which preserves a residual @xmath123  spin symmetry . in the presence of this global spin quantization axis ,",
    "the helical edge states are characterized by a perfect locking of spin and momentum : states with opposite spin move with opposite chirality along the edge . in the presence of ( rashba ) soi ,",
    "no spin symmetry is present resulting in the absence of a global spin quantization axis .",
    "rather , the spin quantization axis of the edge states can precess spatially .",
    "however , as trs is present the kramers pair of helical edge states is still protected from hybridizing , i.e. , from a gap opening on the edge .",
    "this statement is true as long as the bulk gap is maintained implying that the system is adiabatically connected to the @xmath123  preserving case and hence is still in the qsh state .",
    "however , the role of rashba soi for the qsh effect in graphene is only detrimental : upon increasing the strength of rashba soi , the system will go through a quantum phase transition destroying the qsh phase .",
    "conversely , given the lattice symmetry of graphene , switching on rashba spin orbit coupling can not generate the qsh phase starting from a semi - metallic or trivial insulator phase .",
    "the slightly reduced symmetry of silicene stemming from its buckled structure entails several new couplings , at least two of which are of key relevance regarding qsh physics .",
    "first , let us consider the staggered potential distinguishing sublattice a and b that has been introduced formally in ref .",
    "@xcite to open a trivial gap .",
    "while this term is symmetry forbidden in graphene , it has been shown @xcite to be induced by a simple out of plane electric field in silicene as we confirmed in our symmetry analysis above .",
    "this provides a knob to experimentally switch off the qshe .",
    "second , and even more interestingly , it has very recently been conjectured @xcite that the qshe can be generated by virtue of soi terms that are symmetry forbidden in graphene but allowed in silicene .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite probe the sub - gap conductance as a fingerprint of the quantum spin hall state . while a non - vanishing conductance in a phase with a bulk gap is a promising signature of the qsh state , it is not in one to one correspondence with the @xmath1-invariant defining the quantum spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "for example , what is called the qshe2-phase in ref .",
    "@xcite is a trivial insulator which only shows the characteristic conductance of @xmath124  expected for the qsh phase since one additional pair of edge states does not contribute due to a mini - gap at the ribbon sizes considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the conductance in this parameter regime would be @xmath125  signaling a @xmath1-trivial phase .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to calculate the correct phase diagram of silicene in the presence of the ( rashba ) soi terms by rigorous calculation of the @xmath1  invariant in the absence of any symmetries besides trs .",
    "we note that our method can be applied to study the entire parameter space of the silicene band structure without any further complications .",
    "however , in this work , we would like to focus on a particularly interesting parameter regime where the qsh phase is generated by ( rashba ) soi .",
    "previous work on the topology of the qsh state in silicene in the presence of ( rashba ) soi @xcite has been focused on effective models valid close to the @xmath0-points .",
    "however , in the presence of ( rashba ) soi , the bulk gap can close away from the @xmath0-points , a phase transition which would be missed by such power series expansions .",
    "our analysis does not suffer from these limitations since we directly calculate the @xmath1-invariant characterizing the qsh phase from its very definition @xcite .",
    "we find that there is indeed a qsh phase in the absence of the original kane - mele term @xmath61 .",
    "this qsh effect can be switched on by only tuning silicene specific @xmath126  symmtery breaking soi terms and the staggered potential  all terms that are known to have only detrimental effect as to qsh physics in graphene .",
    "our analysis , hence , settles in the affirmative the discussion on whether other soi terms than the @xmath126  conserving kane - mele term can in principle generate a qsh state .",
    "let us briefly give an idea of how the topology of silicene may depend on an external electric field , orienting ourselves along the lines of ref .",
    "we consider again the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham2 ] ) , derived by analytical expansion around the high - symmetry @xmath0-points . without electric fields , the energy spectrum at @xmath0 exhibits a gap of size @xmath127 .",
    "interestingly , in the presence of soi , the bulk gap can be closed by an increasing electric field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the gap closes approximately at the very @xmath0-points , only if the corresponding parameter @xmath110 is small compared to the transfer energy @xmath128 , so @xmath129 .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian allows to give an analytical expression for the gap - closing critical field @xmath130 @xcite . at this point",
    "we may expect a topological phase transition from a qsh to a trivial insulating phase .",
    "this is indicated by the fact , that a gap is reestablished at the @xmath0-points , if the electric field is further increased , exceeding @xmath130 .",
    "however , a rigorous exploration of prospective topological quantum phase transitions in the silicene parameter space requires the calculation of a topological bulk invariant .",
    "therefore , we now turn to the general calculation of the topological @xmath1-invariant defining the qsh phase @xcite . while the @xmath1-invariant is of course a gauge invariant quantity by definition , the original literature @xcite did not provide a constructive recipe for its numerical calculation .",
    "this is so because a calculation following the original definition requires a macroscopic gauge , though giving a gauge invariant result . by macroscopic gauge ,",
    "we mean that the phase relation between bloch functions at remote points in the brillouin zone has to be fixed . however ,",
    "when the band structure is calculated numerically , such phase relations are typically not accessible thus preventing the direct calculation of the invariant .",
    "this problem has only been resolved rather recently @xcite by a more constructive recipe for the direct calculation of the @xmath1-invariant . here ,",
    "we follow the method introduced by prodan @xcite which makes use of the elegant and manifestly gauge invariant formulation of the adiabatic connection @xcite originally introduced in a seminal work by kato back in 1950 @xcite .",
    "recently , the manifestly gauge invariant formulation of topological invariants has been generalized to other topological band structures @xcite .",
    "the crucial step of this approach consists in going from the bloch functions of the occupied bands to the projection operator @xmath131  onto the occupied states . as already pointed out by kato in ref .",
    "@xcite , the advantage of this construction is that the projection operator is obviously basis ( gauge ) independent .",
    "the adiabatic connection is defined as @xmath132,\\ ] ] where @xmath133  is the derivative in momentum space .",
    "note that this connection is manifestly independent of the basis choice within the occupied bands in contrast to the more familiar berry connection .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic connection can be calculated numerically in a straight forward way which is in general not possible for the berry connection . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1  invariant of the qsh state is constructed in a similar way to ref . @xcite but using the adiabatic connection instead of the berry connection .",

    "( [ eqn : katoprop ] ) can be conveniently calculated numerically as products of projection operators @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath145 the path ordering appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : katoprop ] ) then amounts to the ordering of the product in eq .",

    "the gauge invariance of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prodan ] ) might not be obvious at first glance due to the basis dependence of the pfaffians . however , the combinations @xmath147 with @xmath148  appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prodan ] ) are indeed gauge invariant up to the choice of the branch of the multivalued square - root as is obvious from the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sqrtdet ] ) . that is the point where @xmath63  comes into play .",
    "when calculating @xmath149 it has to be assured that the branch choices of the square - root at @xmath150  and @xmath151  are continuously connected to each other .",
    "this can be done by continuously interpolating the phase factor @xmath152  between @xmath150  and @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "if this phase has a winding such that the standard branch cut between riemann sheets ( line @xmath153 $ ]  in the complex plane ) is crossed @xmath154  times during this interpolation , the naive result for @xmath134  is corrected by the factor @xmath155 .    while this procedure might be numerically challenging close to critical points or for large super - cells in disordered systems , it is basically a straightforward recipe . note that the arbitrary basis choice for the representation matrix @xmath138  does not require any knowledge about the relative phase between the basis vectors at different points in @xmath156-space . furthermore",
