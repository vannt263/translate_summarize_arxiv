    "since einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite and schrdinger @xcite investigated the non - classical properties of quantum systems and entered new concept as entanglement in quantum physics , it had become strange property in interaction between particles .",
    "recently the study of the entanglement is a useful resource for quantum communications and information processing @xcite such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and quantum cryptography @xcite whose input states are constructed to be maximally entangled .",
    "also entanglement has been suggested as a quantitative measure for electron - electron ( e - e ) correlation in many body systems @xcite . as a simple illustration of entanglement",
    "we can say that , if there is no way to write the states of two particles as a product of the two systems states in the hilbert space , then there will be an entangled system @xcite .",
    "a lot of investigation has been done about measuring entanglement in the fermionic systems , such as the wooters measure @xcite and the schliemann s measure @xcite . through gittings investigation @xcite",
    ", it is shown that all these entanglement measures are not suitable but the zanardi s measure @xcite satisfies all desirable properties of entanglement measurement .",
    "+ the @xmath0 molecule is the simplest two electron systems that can be used to implement a robust many body calculation based on hubbard model @xcite .",
    "traditional hubbard model which is a priory many - body approach usually is used as a first attempt to calculate entanglement .",
    "this model gives maximum entanglement by setting e - e interaction parameter @xmath9 , which is a controversial conclusion @xcite . in this paper",
    "we go beyond hubbard model to calculate entanglement of the non - magnetic ground and magnetic excited states of @xmath0 molecule .",
    "the @xmath10 molecule is the simplest realistic two electron correlated system in nature which our model can be implemented and considering all direct and exchange interaction terms beyond hubbard model let us account correlation effects more accurately in the wavefunctions .",
    "the zanardi measurement for calculating entanglement was employed .",
    "we will investigate the ground and excited state of @xmath0 to find the effect of the spin on the entanglement of states and results give maximally entangled states with non - zero u value .",
    "we also discuss the difference between maximally , moderately and zero entangled states based on their magnetic property and correlation dependence .",
    "now we explain our calculation method . the complete hubbard hamiltonian is defined as @xcite : h=_ijt_ijc^_ic_j+_ijlm v_ijlmc^_ic^_jc_mc_l .",
    "the first term contains non - interacting part of hamiltonian which can be written as :    _ ijt_ijc^_ic_j= _ _",
    "i=1,2;c^_ic_i+t_ij;c^_ic_j    @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy of atomic orbital , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators on site _",
    "i _ with spin @xmath15 , respectively and _ t _ stands for the hopping integral between two _ h _ atomic sites of the electrons with the same @xmath15 .",
    "the second term of hamiltonian that contains e - e interaction part can also be written as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 contains all coulomb interaction between electrons which involves _ u _ as on - site coulomb repulsion , _ j _ as inter - site coulomb repulsion and @xmath18 is density operator .",
    "the last terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the exchange interactions parameters that can be interpreted by quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider two electrons in two sites or @xmath21 orbital of @xmath0 molecule with spin up and down , therefore we have four states for a single electron so for two electrons there are @xmath22 states which are represented with notation @xmath23 as @xmath24 all the diagonal elements contain a term @xmath25 , where it is roughly four times of the energy of an electron in the @xmath21 state of atomic hydrogen . using @xmath1 @xmath2 energies for @xmath0 and @xmath26 from ref . @xcite and with the parametric energies of hamiltonian , parameters @xmath12 , _ t _ , _ u _ , _ j _ , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , were evaluated and are given in table i.    .the calculated values of hamiltonian parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by acting @xmath29 on the @xmath30 eigenstates , we could find total spin of each state in which @xmath31 have @xmath32 , but @xmath33 has @xmath34 .",
    "we find eigenvalues and eigenstates ( not normalized ) of hydrogen molecule as shown in table ii , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "also the related @xmath37 values of each eigenstates have been summarized in table ii . the eigenstates results schematically demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . now let us discuss calculation results summarized in table ii and fig.1 .",
    "molecule before and after switching on a magnetic field with their related eigenfunctions and spins.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +",
    "from this table we conclude that the many electron wavefunctions have very weaker dependence on the interaction parameters than the energy levels .",
    "the wavefunctions of the first and second excited states are explicitly independent from hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the wavefunction of the ground and third excited state are dependent upon @xmath38 correlation parameters via @xmath39 with @xmath36 in table ii where the exchange interaction @xmath28 is absent in the wavefunctions . both of these states are nonmagnetic ( s=0 ) .",
    "using parameters of table i and von neumann s entropy of eq .",
    "( 6 ) an entanglement value @xmath40\\sim2 $ ] was obtained for these states .",
    "the maximum available value of entanglement is @xmath41 for a system with the hilbert space dimension of the smaller subsystem as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath0 molecule the maximum available entanglement is 2 therefore the resultant maximally entangled ground and third excited states in table ii can be explained by the corresponding wave functions of these states .",
    "the wavefunctions of the ground and third excited states are superposition of four body basis of the systems @xmath43 with equal coefficients since the value of @xmath44 from table i becomes 1 .",
    "+ from table ii , the first excited state @xmath45 is a spin triplet state with @xmath46 and its wavefunction is independent fromcorrelation parameters .",
    "the value of entanglement for the @xmath47 eignfunction is 1 where its value for the eignfunctions with @xmath48 is zero .",
    "the difference between entanglements of the degenerate wavefunctions with different @xmath37 can be explained by their related wavefunctions .",
    "the entanglement of the eignfunction of @xmath49 state is a linear combination of @xmath50 and @xmath51 whereas the wave functions of other @xmath52 are separable ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) .",
    "the importance of the nonzero spin of the first excited state is that this state can be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) under some condition @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic field is off the wavefunction is a superposition of the degenerate wavefunctions with different @xmath37 values .",
    "we calculated entanglement of this degenerate wavefunction as 0 .",
    "however , after switching on the magnetic field , a wavefunction with definite value of entanglement emerges .",
    "the values of the @xmath37 and entanglement for this state are 0 and 1 according to table ii .",
    "therefore we conclude that in practice by switching on a magnetic field on a magnetic state , one can switch from a degenerate and not entangled wavefunction to an entangled wavefunction with @xmath47 .",
    "+ the second excited state @xmath55 is nonmagnetic , @xmath56 , where the wavefunction is independent from correlation parameters .",
    "the calculated entanglement is 1 .",
    "the wavefunction of this state is only a linear combination of two basis set @xmath57 and @xmath58 , hence its entanglement is smaller than ground and third excited states . by comparing the values of the entanglement listed in table",
    "ii , we conclude that the nonmagnetic states @xmath59 in which the wavefunction depend on interaction parameters are maximally entangled and the magnetic states whose wavefunctions are independent from correlation parameters are not entangled . + using von neumann s entropy in eq .",
    "6 , we calculated the variation of entanglement for maximally entangled ground state of @xmath0 molecule with respect to the combination of correlation parameters @xmath36 .",
    "results were plotted in fig .",
    "interaction parameters.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in this figure we observe that the value of entanglement is maximum with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this conclusion resolves previously reported results from other groups @xcite who obtained maximally entangled ground state with @xmath9 . the @xmath9 result",
    "imply that the maximally entangled ground state is not attainable for the @xmath0 since the @xmath1 @xmath2 value of @xmath62 from table i is @xmath63 which is very far from zero .",
    "in our given model the maximally entangled ground state obtained with _ _",
    "u__=_j_. this has a meaningful physical interpretation which states that in such physical system where the inter - atomic distance is very small , the on - site columbic repulsion _ u _ can be very close to the inter - site columbic repulsion _ j_.",
    "indeed the @xmath0 molecule is the best example of such systems when the inter - atomic distance is minimum or @xmath64 and the @xmath1 @xmath2 value of u and v from table ii gives @xmath65 . using @xmath1 @xmath2 parameters of table i",
    ", we obtained @xmath65 and this value of x gives maximally entangled ground state . from fig.2",
    "the maximum entanglement value for @xmath65 is 1.99 .",
    "+ as we observe in fig .",
    "2 , in the extreme limit of @xmath66 , i.e. strongly correlated systems the entanglement becomes smaller and tends to 1 .",
    "the non - magnetic property of this state , sets a limit on minimum available entanglement for this state .",
    "this point can be explained by using eigenfunction listed in table ii . for @xmath67 one of the @xmath68 or @xmath69",
    "goes to zero and the other one becomes very large . in both cases the ground state wavefunctions listed in table ii",
    "reduce from extension on the four components to an extension on the two components similar to @xmath70 state .",
    "therefore the corresponding value of entanglement reduces from 2 to 1 .",
    "this also can be explained by tendency of the strongly correlated systems with @xmath66 to unpaired electronic configuration in atomic orbital such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 states in which energy reduces by loosing _",
    "term in hamiltonian .",
    "such states tend to have parallel spin and magnetism with a reduced entanglement .",
    "+ in the case of @xmath0 where @xmath71 , @xmath62 and @xmath72 are at the same order of magnitude ( see table i ) and @xmath73 is much close to zero hence the molecule is in moderately correlated regime and one can obtain the maximum available entanglement as it is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this regime",
    "we have both spatial and spin correlated wave function@xcite . neglecting exchange interaction in our model ( @xmath74 ) ,",
    "significantly displaces energy levels of the system ( see table ii ) .",
    "however , the dependence of the ground and third excited state wavefunctions on the exchange parameters only is limited to @xmath27 and putting @xmath75 yields @xmath76 and similarly the maximum entanglement becomes 1.99 which is the same as the case of nonzero @xmath27 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "in otherwords in order to obtain maximally entangled states , the most effective parameters are direct columbic interaction parameters @xmath62 and @xmath72 and exchange interaction parameters do not alter the value of entanglement significantly .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we applied a robust many electron calculation on a simplest realistic two electron system i. e. @xmath0 molecule .",
    "going beyond traditional hubbard model let us to account correlation effects accurately in the many electron wavefunction of the ground and excited states .",
    "using @xmath1 @xmath2 e - e interaction parameters , indicates to a moderately correlated regime for the molecule and resulted a maximally entangled ground and third excited state .",
    "the wavefunctions of the not magnetic ( s=0 ) ground and excited states explicitly depend on correlation parameters whereas the first excited states which is magnetic ( @xmath34 and @xmath77 ) is not entangled .",
    "the second excited state is not magnetic but its wavefunction does not depend on correlation parameters therefore it is a moderately entangled state .",
    "anycase , by switching on a magnetic field an entangled state with @xmath4 can be extracted from a not entangled degenerate magnetic state .",
    "we suggest that in a realistic molecular scale systems , there is two criteria for finding maximally entangled electronic states , first the system should be in moderately correlated regime and second the system should have a non - magnetic @xmath5 electronic state .    99 a. einstein , b. podolsky , and n. rosen , phys . rev . * 47 * , 777 ( 1935 ) .",
