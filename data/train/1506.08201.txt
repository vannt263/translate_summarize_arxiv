    "the sources responsible for cosmic reionization are still not well understood .",
    "evidence that quasars ( qsos ) can not be solely responsible for reionization @xcite has prompted many searches for ionizing lyman continuum ( lyc ) emission from star - forming galaxies .",
    "while the igm at @xmath8 is opaque to lyc photons and prevents direct observations of lyc - emitting galaxies during the epoch of reionization , many studies have attempted to detect lower - redshift analogs to galaxies responsible for reionization .",
    "although igm transmission is highest in the local universe , studies at @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ) have yielded very few detections of lyc emission , with only three objects identified to date @xcite . at redshift @xmath10",
    ", the search for lyc - emitting galaxies has appeared to be more fruitful . however , even though the examination of hundreds of galaxies ( in works such as * ? ? ?",

    "* ) has yielded many promising lyc - emitting candidates , there exist only two robust detections @xcite .",
    "amassing large samples of lyc detections in high - redshift star - forming galaxies has been difficult for several reasons .",
    "first , large parent samples of high - redshift galaxies must be identified and confirmed spectroscopically , requiring extensive galaxy surveys ( often ground - based ) and time - consuming spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "second , it is necessary to probe flux in the lyc spectral region for these galaxies , either with deep spectroscopy , also very time - intensive , or through narrowband imaging in a filter just blueward of the lyman limit , in which it is difficult to match a single narrowband filter to the lyc region for many galaxies at once .",
    "even after potential high - redshift lyc - emitting candidates are identified , there remains the possibility that apparent lyc emission is actually due to a lower - redshift interloper along the line of sight , which can not be distinguished in ground - based , seeing - limited data .",
    "one method that has proven successful at identifying potential lyc - emitting galaxies is narrowband lyc imaging of galaxy protoclusters .",
    "large ground - based surveys of uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 @xcite have identified and spectroscopically confirmed thousands of high - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "these surveys have also located galaxy protoclusters , areas on the sky with large overdensities of galaxies at similar redshift .",
    "a very effective way to simultaneously probe the lyc of large samples of galaxies at the same redshift is to perform deep imaging through a narrowband filter tuned to the lyc spectral region at the protocluster redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initially , these protocluster studies were entirely based upon ground - based data with seeing fwhms of @xmath12 , and thus suffered from the possibility of foreground contamination .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that statistical simulations modeling the distribution of foreground galaxies result in high rates of foreground contamination for high - redshift objects in ground - based studies .",
    "while simulations can account for contamination statistically in lyc - emitting samples ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contaminants can not be eradicated on an individual basis . as two of the main goals of lyc studies are to determine the mechanism of lyc photon escape from the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and to identify additional features of lyc - emitting galaxies that may enable their identification through other means , it is crucial to identify robust , individual candidates for lyc emission where foreground contamination has been ruled out .    eliminating contaminants is a complex process .",
    "high - resolution imaging shows that the majority of high - redshift galaxies are not morphologically simple , but are composed of multiple compact clumps and/or diffuse emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "contamination can only be firmly ruled out if the redshifts of individual galaxy clumps are measured , and if the clump associated with lyc emission is confirmed to be at the redshift of the target galaxy . in order to address the issue of contamination in the narrowband lyc survey of the @xmath13 ssa22a protocluster @xcite , @xcite obtained near - ir spectroscopy with keck / nirspec to measure the spectroscopic redshifts of the sub - arcsecond components of 5 lyc candidates .",
    "these authors found two foreground contaminants , one galaxy with a misidentified redshift , and two galaxies that could not be definitively confirmed as lyc - emitters . for galaxies at slightly higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) , @xcite used photometric redshifts obtained through the high - resolution imaging in the candels survey @xcite to analyze the sub - arcsecond clumps of 19 candidate lyc - emitters , finding 18 contaminants and one bona - fide lyc emitter .",
    "these two studies have shown that both methods @xmath15 high - resolution spectroscopy and photometric redshifts @xmath15 are effective ways to locate foreground contaminants .    in @xcite ( hereafter m13 ) , we performed a narrowband lyc imaging survey of a galaxy protocluster in the hs1549 + 1919 field @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we present follow - up observations with @xmath1 for the sample of candidate lyc emitters in m13 with the goal of using photometric redshifts to eliminate contaminants from the lyc emitter sample .",
    "the hs1549 protocluster has a redshift - space overdensity of @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and this `` spike '' redshift coincides with that of a hyperluminous qso @xcite .",
    "more than 350 uv - selected galaxies have been identified in the hs1549 field , @xmath18 of which have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , narrowband imaging with a 4670  filter tuned to the wavelength of ly@xmath20  at the redshift spike has revealed @xmath21300 potential ly@xmath20  emitters ( laes ) and several ly@xmath20   blobs \" @xcite . in m13",
    ", we used a narrowband filter ( nb3420 ) tuned to wavelengths just below the lyman limit at @xmath22 , thus observing the lyc spectral region for hundreds of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and laes at @xmath22 , including 49 lbgs and 91 laes with spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "we identified putative lyc emitters in the nb3420 imaging , and also performed a stacking analysis of objects undetected in the nb3420 filter ( measuring no signal ) .",
    "although we found an nb3420 detection rate of @xmath23% in both the lbg and lae samples , simulations indicated that 40 - 75% of the individual nb3420 detections may have resulted from foreground contamination , highlighting the need for further work to disentangle true lyc emitters from low - redshift contaminants .",
    "our aims in the current work are two - fold .",
    "our primary goal is to address the question of foreground contamination in the m13 lyc - emitter sample .",
    "ideally , as in @xcite , we would obtain spatially - resolved spectroscopy in the vicinity of each putative lyc detection , with resolution of @xmath245 , in order to measure the redshifts of all components .",
    "however , ground - based optical spectroscopy probing the rest - frame uv provides insufficient spatial resolution , and ground - based near - ir spectroscopy of rest - frame optical nebular emission lines ( with or without the assistance of adaptive optics ) is not feasible because at @xmath25 the strongest nebular emission lines ( h@xmath20 , [ oiii]@xmath265007 , h@xmath27 , and [ oii]@xmath263727 ) are lost either in the thermal background or gaps in atmospheric transmission .",
    "therefore , we have identified high - resolution , multi - band @xmath1 imaging as the best method for estimating spatially resolved photometric redshifts for the individual galaxy subcomponents associated with apparent lyc emission .",
    "our second goal is to analyze the properties of galaxies we have verified to be true sources of lyc emission ( such as their morphologies , stellar populations , and the ratio of their ionizing to non - ionizing flux densities ) with respect to properties of star - forming galaxies without lyc detections .",
    "such an analysis will help determine whether galaxies with high escape fractions of ionizing photons have different intrinsic properties from those of galaxies without detectable leaking ionizing radiation , and may provide insight into star formation and the structure of the ism in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in addition to presenting high - resolution , multiwavelength follow - up @xmath1 observations of high - redshift lyc - emitting candidates at @xmath25 from m13 , we discuss the implications for continuing searches for ionizing radiation in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] describes our methodology , while the galaxy sample and @xmath1 observations are presented in section [ sec : obs ] . in section [ sec : dataphot ] we describe the techniques used to reduce the @xmath1 imaging data and perform photometry on the sub - arcsecond components of each galaxy .",
    "section [ sec : photoz ] contains a discussion of our methods of fitting photometric redshifts to the data , as well as an analysis of each candidate lyc emitter and any sources of foreground contamination . in section [ sec : md5 ] we analyze the properties of our best candidate for true lyc emission ( md5 ) with respect to the larger population of star - forming galaxies . in section [ sec :",

    "figure [ fig : methods ] shows the locations of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 filters superimposed over a model @xcite galaxy spectrum redshifted to @xmath7 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 and @xmath36 filters is particularly powerful for this test , due to the observed wavelength of the balmer break at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this wavelength corresponds exactly to the red cut - off of @xmath35 and the blue cut - off of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath39 color is very sensitive to the presence of the balmer break , and provides information about the age of the stellar population .",
    "additionally , the @xmath40 color probes the rest - frame uv slope at @xmath25 , providing information about the stellar populations and dust extinction . at @xmath41 , where most of the contaminants found by @xcite are located , the @xmath35 filter falls entirely on the red side of the balmer break , and therefore , extremely flat @xmath39 colors are expected , with the balmer break falling instead between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath33 filter does not lie entirely bluewards of the lyman limit at @xmath37 ( only 80% of its wavelength range falls below the lyman limit ) and thus does not exclusively probe the lyc spectral region . however , given that the lyman break passes through this filter at redshifts @xmath42 , the @xmath43 color should be sensitive to the magnitude of the lyman break at @xmath37 , and to its absence at significantly lower redshift . with both lyman and balmer breaks sensitively probed at @xmath37 using @xmath0 photometry , we can distinguish between true sources of lyc emission , and those nb3420 detections attributable to non - ionizing radiation at lower redshift .",
    "several complications may arise from the method of estimating the photometric redshifts using only these four filters .",
    "first , galaxies with leaking lyc emission may have intrinsically high ratios of escaping ionizing to non - ionizing radiation , and may not exhibit as strong a lyman break as expected from normal @xmath7 galaxies .",
    "we keep this caveat in mind during our subsequent analysis , with the understanding that the @xmath43 color may not be accurately represented by the models .",
    "second , young galaxies ( @xmath44 myr ) may not have a significant balmer break .",
    "the combination of these two scenarios may result in a young , high - redshift , lyc emitter with a relatively featureless spectrum , making it difficult to distinguish such galaxies from low - redshift contaminants . in our photometric redshift analysis ,",
    "we highlight cases of galaxies with ambiguous sed shapes and the possible stellar populations these seds may indicate .",
    "the hs1549 galaxy sample discussed in m13 consists of 49 lbgs and 91 laes , all spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath45 .",
    "there are 9 objects part of both the lae and lbg samples ; for simplicity in displaying our data , we group these objects with the lbgs .",
    "the redshift limit of @xmath45 ensures that the nb3420 filter is sensitive only to lyc emission , with no contamination from flux redward of the lyman limit . out of these galaxies , 5 lbgs and 7 laes have nb3420 detections within 19 of the non - ionizing uv ( @xmath46 ) centroid of the galaxy , indicating potential lyc emission if there is no lower - redshift galaxy contaminant along the line of sight .    in m13 we also present an additional sample of 33 photometric lae candidates ( no spectroscopic confirmation ) in the hs1549 field whose magnitudes in the narrowband filter used to select laes ( nb4670 ) are in the same range as those of the spectroscopically - confirmed laes .",
    "thus , the photometric lae sample of m13 was defined to be any additional laes with @xmath47 that did not have spectroscopic confirmation . ] . while these objects are not included in the analysis of m13 because the lack of spectroscopic redshifts increases the possibility of contamination , 10 of them",
    "are reported to have nb3420 detections .",
    "finally , in m13 we present 8 spectroscopically confirmed laes with nb3420 detections that are either fainter than the magnitude limit of the main lae sample ( @xmath48 ; 5 objects ) or were selected by their @xmath49nb4670 color rather than @xmath50nb4670 ( 3 objects ) .",
    "we did not include these objects in the analysis of m13 because we had not assembled a complete and unbiased spectroscopic sample of laes with @xmath48 or laes selected by their @xmath49nb4670 color .    in",
    "the follow - up observations presented in this work , we considered all objects with nb3420 detections presented in m13 and chose @xmath1 pointings oriented to maximize the number of these potential lyc - emitting targets on the image footprints",

    "however , with two separate @xmath1 pointings in each of the 4 filters ( see figure [ fig : pointings ] ) , we obtained @xmath0 photometry for all but two of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the main sample : 4/5 lbgs and 6/7 laes .",
    "we also obtained @xmath0 photometry for 4/10 photometric lae candidates , and 2/6 of spectroscopically confirmed laes with @xmath48 , totaling 16 galaxies with nb3420 detections covered in all four filters .",

    "figure [ fig : sed_samples ] shows @xmath0 photometry for several galaxies in the sample that span the range of typical sed shapes . as expected , the lyman break is present in the seds of all galaxies without lyc detections .",
    "furthermore , every object in the lyc non - detection sample is undetected in @xmath33 , which is consistent with the nb3420 non - detections in m13 .",

    "it must be kept in mind , however that the strength of the lyman break may not be an effective way to identify the redshifts of lyc - emitting galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the galaxies in the lyc non - detection sample all exhibit a non - detection in @xmath33 , there was a large range of @xmath253 colors in both the lae and lbg samples , indicating the corresponding range in rest - frame uv slopes among the galaxies in our sample ( see the upper panel of figure [ fig : colorhist ] ) .",
    "in the lbg sample , the @xmath253 color ranged from @xmath254 ( median @xmath255 ) , with most galaxies displaying red rest - frame uv slopes .",
    "in contrast , the lae sample had @xmath256 ( median @xmath257 ) , with most galaxies displaying blue rest - frame uv slopes .",

    "the @xmath39 colors of galaxies ranged from @xmath261 ( mean @xmath262 ) , and did not differ significantly between the lbg and lae samples ( see the lower panel of figure [ fig : colorhist ] ) .",
    "additionally , there were a few objects in the lyc non - detection sample that demonstrated the typical sed shapes of low - redshift contaminants ( see the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sed_samples ] ) .",
    "we found that the main features that help identify a low - redshift interloper are the presence of flat @xmath263 and @xmath264 colors , especially when accompanied by a large break between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see figure [ fig : colorcolor ] ) .",
    "for contaminants , the break between @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponds to a balmer break or 4000  break between @xmath265 , and has typical values of @xmath266 . the only complication , however , is that young , dusty galaxies may also present nearly flat @xmath264 colors with red @xmath253 colors . if @xmath263 is flat ( i.e. , no lyman break ) , then galaxies with flat @xmath264 colors and red @xmath253 colors can easily be identified as low - redshift contaminants .",

    "we also stress again that employing the @xmath263 color to distinguish a contaminant from a @xmath268 galaxy may be problematic when applied to galaxies with potential lyc emission , as the magnitude of the lyman break for lyc galaxies is not well understood ( m13 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we used the photometric redshift code eazy @xcite to fit the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 photometry acquired with @xmath1 and estimate the redshifts of each sub - arcsecond component in the vicinity of our lae and lbg targets . in order to choose the best input parameters for eazy and",
    "learn how to interpret the output eazy produces , we first ran the code on a test sample of @xmath25 lbgs and laes in our @xmath1 images with known spectroscopic redshifts , unambiguous sed shapes , and no nb3420 detections .",

    ", we were able to make such a distinction without the complication of possible lyc emission , which might be associated with `` non - standard '' seds .",
    "finally , we note that we did not include any components where the sed shape was ambiguous ( see definition in section [ sec : sed ] ) because it was not clear from the sed shape if that component was at high or low redshift .",
    "we varied several input parameters to eazy in order to determine their optimal values .",
    "first , we experimented with fitting our data using different stellar population synthesis models .",
    "eazy defaults to pgase models @xcite , which span a range of star - formation histories , metallicities , ages , and reddenings using the @xcite attenuation curve .",
    "to the five default pgase models , eazy adds additional templates representing a dusty starburst galaxy ( described in * ? ? ? * ) and two templates for old , dusty galaxies ( from ` eazy_v1.1_lines/ ` and ` dusty/ ` in the online development version ) .",
    "eazy also includes a set of model templates from @xcite ( br07 ) , which are based on @xcite models .",
    "both the pgase and br07 models provided good , qualitatively similar fits to most of our lbgs and laes , but failed to accurately represent galaxies with blue uv slopes ( @xmath269 ) and galaxies with seds younger than @xmath2150 myr ( see figure [ fig : sed_ambig ] ) .",
    "therefore , we experimented with additional stellar population models that might provide a better fit to the bluest and youngest galaxies in our sample .",
    "these included bpass models , which have a more accurate treatment of wolf - rayet stars and massive stellar binaries @xcite , and starburst99 ( sb99 ) models with updated treatment of stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "additional impetus for considering bluer templates is their increased emission in the lyc spectral region , which may provide a method of more accurately modeling galaxies with lyc detections .",
    "in addition to experimenting with the choice of stellar population models , we also used two different extinction curves to redden the bpass and sb99 models , for which only constant star - formation ( csf ) histories are available .",
    "the @xcite attenuation curve has been traditionally used to model extinction in high - redshift star - forming galaxies , but recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has shown that an smc extinction curve may be more appropriate for galaxies with ages younger than 100 myr . therefore , we made two sets of csf templates with each of the bpass and sb99 models , one template set reddened exclusively with the @xcite attenuation curve , and another reddened with the @xcite attenuation curve for templates with older galactic ages and the smc extinction curve from @xcite for templates with ages less than 100 myr .",
    "based on the analysis of objects without lyc detections , we verified that , for the majority of galaxies , eazy estimates the correct redshift of the galaxy within roughly @xmath270 of the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "thus , we can successfully use photometric redshifts to determine if most galaxy clumps are at @xmath25 or are low - redshift contaminants , keeping in mind that we have fairly coarse redshift precision . as eazy provides several estimators for the photometric redshift ( e.g. , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath272 to address the pathological case where there are two widely - separated peaks in the probability distribution that have similar integrated probabilities . ] ) , we investigated each of them while varying the input parameters to the program and determined that @xmath273 provided the best estimate of the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "all photometric redshifts we quote use the @xmath273 estimator .",
    "of the range of input parameters tested on the sample of objects without lyc detections , we determined that the pgase models result in photometric redshifts that most closely match the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "these models had both the smallest systematic offset and lowest standard deviation of all the variations of input parameters we tried , yielding @xmath274 .",
    "we note that while the pgase models work best for the sample as a whole , the bpass models provide the best fits to galaxies with blue rest - frame uv slopes ( @xmath269 ) . also , as the eazy pgase models only include 5 templates , they did not accurately fit galaxies with younger seds .",
    "better fits were achieved for young galaxies by implementing a fine grid of young bpass templates , specifically by including smc - reddened models with ages of 1 myr , 5 myr , 10 myr , 30 myr , and 50 myr . throughout our analysis of the galaxies with potential lyc detections ( section [ sec : lyc ] ) , we employ both the pgase models and the smc - reddened bpass models with additional young galaxy templates in order to fully examine the likely photometric redshifts for each galaxy .",
    "all figures in this paper displaying output from eazy show fits using the smc - reddened bpass models , unless otherwise indicated .      in total",
    ", we have observations in all four @xmath0 filters for 16 galaxies with potential lyc detections .",
    "these 16 galaxies include 4 lbgs and 8 laes with spectroscopic confirmation , as well as 4 lae photometric candidates . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the results of our analysis of these potential lyc emitters .",
    "we describe the sources of contamination for 11 targets with obvious contaminants , present 4 galaxies with ambiguous seds that may or may not be at high redshift , and argue for md5 as a true lyc emitter .",
    "we also note 3 objects for which the @xmath1 imaging revealed that the spectroscopic redshift was incorrectly assigned in m13 .",
    "this analysis is contingent upon the precise alignment between the @xmath1 and lris nb3420 imaging , as described in section [ sec : dataphot ] .",
    "seven objects with keck / lris spectroscopic redshifts ( 2 lbgs : md12 , m16 ; 5 laes : _ lae1670 _ , _ lae2292 _ , _ lae2966 _ , _ lae6662 _ , and _ lae7832 _ ) and one object in the photometric lae sample ( _ lae3038 _ ) had contaminants that stood out plainly with the combination of high - resolution @xmath1 imaging and sed fitting . each of these objects was resolved into several clumps in the @xmath1 imaging . in all cases , at least one of the clumps had an sed fit corresponding to the redshift of the keck / lris spectrum ( or consistent with the spike redshift @xmath7 , in the case of _ lae3038",
    "_ ) , while the clump associated with the lyc emission had the unambiguous sed of a @xmath265 contaminant ( flat @xmath263 and @xmath264 , red @xmath253 ; similar to the example contaminant shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sed_samples ] ) .",
    "for these eight objects , the nb3420 emission had a fairly large offset from the original galaxy coordinates ; the offsets between the nb3420 detection and ly@xmath20  emission ranged from 057 to 115 with a median value of 065 ( 5.0 kpc at @xmath7 ) , and offsets between the nb3420 emission and the lris @xmath50band emission ranged from 012 to 126 with a median value of 072 ( 5.7 kpc at @xmath7 ) .",
    "the morphology of these objects in the @xmath1 images supports the evidence from the sed fits that these objects are not physically associated ; the clumps are distinct , with no evidence for diffuse emission between them that might indicate interactions between galaxies at the same redshift .",

    "is the lbg md5 , which has a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath285 confirmed by spectra from both lris and the mosfire near - ir multi - object spectrograph ( see figure [ fig : md5 ] ) .",
    "the lris spectrum was taken in may 2011 ( m13 ) and shows ly@xmath20  emission ( @xmath286 ) , along with multiple absorption features ( cii , siii , and oi ; @xmath287 ) .",
    "the @xmath288band mosfire spectrum was acquired in june 2012 , and contains detections of both [ oiii ] emission lines ( 4959 , 5007 ; @xmath289 ) .",

    "the orientation of the mosfire and lris observations ( slit pas of 274 and 111 degrees , respectively ; see figure [ fig : md5 ] ) were such that both clumps fell within the spectroscopic slits .",
    "although it is not possible to distinguish between the clumps in the spectra due to slit orientation and seeing ( 06 for mosfire , 07 - 10 for lris ) , neither spectrum shows evidence for spurious emission or absorption features that would indicate the presence of a low - redshift interloper .    ideally , as in the case of _",
    "ion1 _ in @xcite , a candidate lyc - emitting galaxy would have a simple , compact morphology . in such a case , the probability of a foreground interloper is negligible .",

    ", only 20% have simple , compact morphologies .",
    "close inspection reveals clumpy morphologies in all other cases , and several lbgs are comprised of clumps with offsets significantly greater than the 058 offset of the md5 clumps .",
    "for example , lbgs m23 , md9 , and c13 are comprised of clumps suggested by sed fits to be at the lbg redshift with offsets of 091 , 100 , and 119 , respectively . as the majority of lbgs consist of several associated clumps at the same redshift , the fact that md5 displays multiple clumps does not necessarily indicate that md5b ( the clump associated with the nb3420 detection ) is a foreground contaminant .",
    "however , the presence of the second clump opens the possibility that one of these clumps is a low - redshift interloper , and thus we examine the sed fits to md5a and md5b for evidence of foreground contamination ( see figure [ fig : md5 ] ) .",
    "both clumps are nearly identical in @xmath34 magnitude , and are within 0.1 - 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "md5b has the ambiguous sed shape described in section [ sec : sed ] .",
    "as the spectroscopic redshift of md5 is higher than most galaxies in our sample , the @xmath36 filter actually falls right at the location of the balmer break , rather than redwards of the break .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 filter is partially contaminated by flux bluewards of the balmer break , and @xmath39 no longer probes the full strength of the break .",
    "therefore , the fact that md5b has a smaller @xmath39 color than the lower - redshift lbgs in our sample does not necessarily indicate a young age or low - redshift contaminant .",
    "figure [ fig : colorcolor ] shows md5b plotted with respect to other galaxies in our sample in @xmath40 vs. @xmath39 . if md5b is truly at @xmath285 , it has a very small balmer break ( @xmath291 ) , a red uv slope ( @xmath292 , equal to the mean of the lbg sample ) , and a @xmath33 detection brighter than expected by standard stellar population synthesis models ( unsurprising for a lyc emitter ) . if md5b is a foreground interloper , eazy estimates that the most likely redshifts for the interloper are @xmath293 or @xmath294 using pgase models , and between @xmath295 using reddened bpass models . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath296 is the most likely contaminant redshift .    the strongest evidence that md5b is indeed at @xmath285 is the lack of spurious emission or absorption lines in both the lris and mosfire spectra . because these spectra span different wavelength ranges ( 3100@xmath157000   for lris and 1.95@xmath152.4 @xmath297 m for mosfire ) , we can rule out strong emission lines for several redshift ranges .",
    "these include h@xmath20 emission between @xmath298 , ly@xmath20  emission at @xmath299 , [ oii ] emission at @xmath300 , and [ oiii ] emission at @xmath301 .",
    "we note that the lack of spurious emission lines in the @xmath288band mosfire spectrum rules out h@xmath20 emission right in the redshift range predicted by eazy to be the most probable redshift of a contaminant ( @xmath302 )",

    "these observations would maximize the distance between the two clumps ( separated by 058 ) and , if taken under conditions of good seeing , potentially distinguish emission from each clump individually .",
    "one of the main goals of this work is to investigate the multiwavelength properties of galaxies with and without lyc emission , in order to better understand the mechanism of lyc photon escape from galaxies .",
    "we are also interested in investigating any systematic differences between galaxies with and without lyc emission , for such differences may facilitate the search for lyc - emitting galaxies both during and after the epoch of reionization .",
    "as our @xmath1 data has left us with only one robust candidate for lyc emission ( md5 ) , we here discuss the morphological properties and best - fit stellar population of this object with respect to the properties of typical lbgs .",
    "figure [ fig : lbg_stamps ] displays imaging of md5 in all available bands .",
    "morphologically , md5 is composed of two clumps ( md5a , md5b ) separated by 058 ( 4.4 kpc at @xmath285 ) .",
    "the @xmath34 magnitudes for each clump ( representing the non - ionizing uv continuum ) are @xmath303 and @xmath304 . in section [ sec : md5cand ] we present arguments for why both of these clumps are likely at the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath285 and why foreground contamination is unlikely .",
    "the clumpy morphology of md5 is similar to that of many other lbg systems , which commonly exhibit significant substructure .",
    "md5b , which is more diffuse and lower in surface brightness than md5a , is the clump associated with the nb3420 detection ( i.e. , the lyc emission ) .",
    "because of the particularly high redshift of md5 , we are able to directly map the lyc emission in the high - resolution @xmath1 @xmath33 image .",
    "while most galaxies in our sample had redshifts of roughly @xmath25 and the @xmath33 filter was partially contaminated by non - ionizing flux redwards of the lyman limit , md5 is at high enough redshift ( @xmath285 ) that the @xmath33 filter probes the lyc spectral region without any contamination .",
    "while md5b is formally undetected in @xmath33 at 3@xmath65 , emission at the location of md5b is visible by eye in the @xmath33 imaging .",
    "md5b has a 2.25@xmath65 detection in @xmath33 ( @xmath305 ) , which is consistent within errors of the detection in nb3420 ( @xmath306 ) .",

    "we measured a value for this offset of @xmath307 = 008 .",
    "as there are no additional @xmath2 galaxies in our sample with @xmath33 detections to compare to , we examined the distribution of @xmath43 offsets for the foreground contaminants in our sample . in this way , we measured @xmath307 for objects where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both probing the non - ionizing continuum , and thus should not demonstrate significant offsets .",
    "for the contaminant sample , we found a roughly flat distribution of offsets between 00 and 012 with a mean offset of 0065 and a standard deviation of 0031 .",
    "as md5b has an offset consistent with the mean of the contaminant distribution , we conclude that its measured offset is not significant .",
    "this lack of significant offset implies either that lyc emission is escaping isotropically from md5b , or that , if lyc emission escapes only from cleared holes in the ism , md5b must be oriented such that the opening is along our line of sight .",
    "the spectral features of md5 shed light on the kinematics of its ism .",
    "the [ oiii ] @xmath308 nebular emission line observed in the mosfire spectrum of md5 , which indicates the systemic redshift , places md5 at @xmath289 .",

    "at the rate of one lyc detection per protocluster , observations of at least @xmath436 protoclusters would be necessary to obtain a sample large enough to investigate systematic differences between lyc - leakers and non - leakers . while the environment in the igm surrounding protoclusters may not be typical of the universe as a whole ,",
    "it is unlikely to affect the escape of ionizing photons through the ism of lyc - emitting galaxies .",
    "the factor that is less well - constrained in protocluster environments is the estimate of the sample - averaged igm transmission , which enters into the calculation of the global ionizing emissivity .",
    "however , galaxies in protoclusters can still be very useful for studying the multiwavelength properties of lyc emitters .",
    "an additional potential problem with targeting protoclusters for lyc studies is that protoclusters may be composed of galaxies with older stellar populations on average ( as we found in this work ; also , see * ? ? ?",
    "if lyc emission is primarily emitted from galaxies with younger stellar populations ( as suggested by the lyc detection for md5b ) , then lyc emitters may be less common in protoclusters .",
    "next , there is the question of the required observations .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts must be measured for a large sample of protocluster galaxies , as photometric redshifts are not sufficiently precise to determine whether or not apparent lyc emission originates below 912 .",
    "multiwavelength @xmath1 imaging should then be obtained to probe the sed shapes and lyc emission for all galaxy components near the high - redshift targets ( as in this work ) . to allow for direct lyc imaging ,",
    "the protocluster identified must be at a redshift where one of the currently available @xmath1 filters probes the lyc spectral region just bluewards of the lyman limit ( such as @xmath437 for @xmath438 , or @xmath439 for @xmath440 ) . to obtain useful limits on the amount of escaping ionizing radiation from the faintest galaxies , lyc magnitudes",

    "larger objects , comparable in size to md5b , would require imaging @xmath445 times deeper .",
    "in practice , the best way to measure the average @xmath378 ratio for the faintest galaxies may be with stacked lyc observations , or with the next - generation uv space telescope ( e.g. , atlast ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , if the morphology of the candidates for lyc emission are complex , the last step would be to obtain high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up of the lyc - emitting component of the galaxy .",
    "this plan is streamlined relative to the process we have followed thus far because it skips the time - intensive ground - based lyc imaging and analysis .",
    "the main benefit of the ground - based lyc imaging was that we were able to design a custom , narrowband filter for the exact redshift of the protocluster .",
    "narrowband filters placed just bluewards of the lyman limit are the least affected by igm absorption , and probe lyc emission at wavelengths where the lyc photons are most likely to ionize hydrogen .",
    "even so , these benefits do not outweigh the cost in time and resources if @xmath1 filters are already available at the correct wavelengths to probe lyc emission . for cluster redshifts where @xmath1 filters are not available for lyc imaging , but the lyman limit falls above the atmospheric cut - off",
    ", it would be possible to obtain ground - based narrowband lyc imaging first at @xmath2 with , e.g. , keck / lris .",
    "the roughly two dozen lyc - emitter candidates that would fall within a single keck / lris pointing ( most of which would be contaminants ) could be followed up individually with an ao - assisted integral field spectrograph such as keck / osiris @xcite . in all future lyc searches ,",
    "it is imperative to obtain high - resolution imaging and redshift confirmation of each galaxy sub - arcsecond component associated with apparent lyc emission in order to rule out foreground contamination .",

    "we also note that the emission in the @xmath33 filter at the location of md5b , which probes lyc emission at @xmath285 , shows no spatial offset from the @xmath34 emission , supporting the interpretation that the ionizing photons are escaping either isotropically , or through a hole in the ism directly along our line of sight .",

    ", keck / lris spectroscopy with a total exposure time of 17400 seconds was attempted under suboptimal conditions ( intermittent clouds with seeing of 07@xmath1510 during clear spells ) , but again , no redshift could be measured .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic redshifts for these lae candidates makes it impossible to confidently claim a lyc detection for any of them .",
    "furthermore , the shapes of their seds are ambiguous .",
    "thus , while we ca nt unequivocally confirm any of these candidates as lyc - emitters , we also can not rule them out as foreground contaminants .",

    "lae4070_. laes were selected by their @xmath50nb4670 colors , as described in m13 , and _",
    "lae4070 _ has a @xmath50nb4670 color of 0.82 , slightly below the median value of the lae sample and 0.22 mag above the selection threshold of @xmath50nb4670@xmath3600.6 . while _",
    "lae4070 _ is fairly compact , it is still composed of two clumps separated by 024 ( _ lae4070a _ and _ lae4070b _ , indicated in figure [ fig : nb4070 ] ) for which we analyzed separate seds .",
    "both of these clumps are associated with nb3420 emission , and both clumps are detected individually in @xmath33 .",
    "_ lae4070b _ has the typical sed shape of a foreground contaminant .",
    "_ lae4070a _ , however , has an sed shape that could not be well described by any of the stellar population models we used with eazy .",
    "the feature that most strongly indicates a redshift of @xmath25 for _ lae4070a _ is the large break between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , combined with a flat @xmath253 color . in figure",
    "[ fig : colorcolor ] , _ lae4070a _ has colors that place it in the same region of color - color space as typical laes and lbgs at @xmath25 ( @xmath459 , @xmath460 ) .",
    "the emission in the @xmath33 filter is anomalously high compared to any model that provides a good fit @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . while some of this emission may be contamination from nearby _ lae4070b _",
    ", there is definitely emission in the @xmath33 filter at the location of _ lae4070a _ , which was not the case for any of the laes or lbgs without nb3420 detections .",
    "_ is truly at @xmath25 , then it is a lyc emitter .",
    "however , in this case , measuring the ratio of ionizing to non - ionizing flux for _ lae4070a _ in our nb3420 image is impossible .",
    "the foreground galaxy _ lae4070b _ is located so close along the line of sight to _ lae4070a _ that there is no way to distinguish the nb3420 fluxes of these two objects with the 07 seeing in the lris nb3420 image .",
    "finally , we note that the foreground contaminant _",
    "lae2436a _ ( which spectroscopy proved to be at @xmath278 ) has an sed similar in shape to that of _ lae4070a _ in @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and this object lies near _ lae4070a _ in figure [ fig : colorcolor ] ( @xmath461 , @xmath462 ) .",
    "the fact that degeneracies still exist in this area of @xmath39 and @xmath40 color - color space where the majority of @xmath268 laes and lbgs lie demonstrates the need for spectroscopic redshifts to resolve cases with ambiguous seds .",
    "we now consider the object _",
    "lae7180 _ , an lae originally assigned a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath463 based on a keck / lris spectrum with a single high signal - to - noise emission line .",
    "the narrowband nb4670 filter used for lae selection only probes redshifts of @xmath464 , so the redshift of @xmath463 was anomalously high for a nb4670-selected lae candidate .",
    "however , we considered the possibility that a higher - redshift object with very large ly@xmath20  equivalent width scattered into the lae sample , and therefore retained _",
    "lae7180 _ for analysis in m13 .",
    "the @xmath1 imaging for this object , however , indicates that there is another faint galaxy in the vicinity of the @xmath463 emission line , in addition to _",
    "lae7180_. closer examination of the lris spectrum with respect to the @xmath1 images ( see figure [ fig : nb7180 ] ) suggests that _ lae7180 _ is offset by 113 from the location of the @xmath463 emission . with the @xmath1 imaging we were able to identify the true galaxy associated with the emission line , an object so faint ( @xmath465 ) that it was undetected in the original lris imaging .",
    "the sed fit for this new object matches the redshift @xmath463 identified in the spectrum , and we conclude that the emission line belongs to this faint , nearby object and not to _ lae7180_. now that the @xmath463 redshift is no longer associated with _",
    "lae7180 _ , this object can be reevaluated as a photometric lae candidate with a nb3420 detection .    _",
    "lae7180 _ , _ lae5200 _ , and _",
    "lae6510 _ , all exhibit ambiguous sed shapes . rather than having sed shapes like that of _ lae4070 _",
    ", these objects have sed shapes similar to the one described in section [ sec : sed ] , which may represent either young , dusty , high - redshift galaxies or foreground contaminants .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sed_ambig ] for a spectroscopically confirmed galaxy with an ambiguous sed shape , eazy gives a wide range of possible values for the redshift using both the pgase and smc - reddened bpass models .",
    "however , as figure [ fig : sed_ambig ] also shows , the resulting redshift probability distributions may differ when using different sets of models .",
    "thus , without spectroscopic redshifts , it remains unclear for these lae photometric candidates with ambiguous sed shapes whether they are low - redshift foreground galaxies with an old stellar population , or high - redshift laes with young , dusty stellar populations and lyc detections .",
    "while we can not absolutely confirm if they are lyc emitters without spectroscopic redshifts , the high - resolution @xmath1 imaging and sed fits can help narrow down the possible interpretations for these objects .",
    "figure [ fig : amb_lae ] shows the @xmath1 imaging and photometry for the sub - arcsecond component of each lae that is associated with the nb3420 emission , along with the eazy redshift probability distributions for these components . for each component",
    ", eazy predicts a wide range of possible redshifts ( @xmath466 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : amb_lae ] shows bpass sed fits to the photometry both at low and high redshift , and the fact that both redshifts can fit the data well demonstrates again the difficulties in distinguishing between low and high redshifts for galaxies with these sed shapes . in all of these cases , the detection of lyc emission depends on whether or not the lae photometric candidate is truly at @xmath268 - something that we can not confirm for galaxies with ambiguous sed shapes and without spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "here we consider possible causes for the scenario in which all three of these photometric lae candidates ( _ lae5200 _ , _ lae6510 _ , and _ lae7180",
    "_ ) were incorrectly identified as laes .",
    "_ lae6510 _ and _ lae7180 _ have fairly marginal @xmath50nb4670 colors ( 0.68 and 0.63 , respectively ) when compared to the lae selection threshold of @xmath50nb4670@xmath3600.6 .",
    "these values are in the lowest 15% of the @xmath50nb4670 colors for spectroscopically confirmed laes in m13 , and indicate that these objects are among the weaker lae candidates and may have scattered into the lae sample through photometric errors . as for _ lae5200 _ , its @xmath50nb4670 color is 3.21 , an anomalously high value that may be due to contaminating light from a nearby bright star .",
    "finally , these photometric lae candidates were chosen for follow - up because of their nb3420 emission .",
    "as our new dataset reveals , true lyc detections in @xmath2 galaxies are rare . therefore , while many of the lae photometric candidates from m13 may be true laes , singling out objects from the photometric sample with nb3420 detections may result in a higher - than - average selection of foreground contaminants .    in summary , these four photometric lae candidates with nb3420 detections all have ambiguous sed shapes that make it difficult to verify their redshifts photometrically and confirm their possible lyc detections .",
    "one object , _",
    "lae4070 _ , has similar @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors to many @xmath25 galaxies in our sample and is the most promising photometric lae candidate for true lyc emission .",
    "the other three objects ( _ lae5200 _ , _ lae6510 _ , and _",
    "lae7180 _ ) display the ambiguous sed shape described in section [ sec : sed ] , which may describe galaxies at many redshifts .",
    "as we can not unambiguously determine whether or not the four photometric lae candidates discussed in this section are truly at @xmath25 , we adopt a conservative approach and do not count the nb3420 detections for these objects as secure signatures of leaking lyc radiation .",
    "here we present postage stamp images of galaxies with nb3420 detections , but for which imaging was not available in all four @xmath1 filters ( see figure [ fig : stamps_appendix ] ) . while insufficient photometric data prevents us from fitting seds and determining photometric redshifts , we attempted to examine the morphologies of these objects in the @xmath34 image , when available , to find objects with simple morphology where the possibility of contamination is low .",
    "however , none of the objects shown in figure [ fig : stamps_appendix ] have simple , compact morphologies in @xmath34 .",
    "all objects either break into individual sub - arcsecond components or show extended diffuse emission . as both clumpy @xmath2 galaxies and foreground contaminants may be responsible for these multi - component @xmath34 morphologies , we are unable to draw any conclusions about the amount of contamination in this galaxy sample .                                                                              , a.  m. , fruchter , a.  s. , hook , r.  n. , & hack , w. 2003 , in hst calibration workshop : hubble after the installation of the acs and the nicmos cooling system , ed .",
