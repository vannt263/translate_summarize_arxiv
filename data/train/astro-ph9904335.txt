    "complete or , at least , statistically well defined samples of optical identifications of faint x - ray sources , are important for a number of scientific goals . for example , combined optical and x - ray data allow to obtain information about the luminosity functions of various types of x - ray sources as well as their evolution with redshift . in turn",
    ", these informations can be used to further constrain models for the production of the x - ray background , discovered more than thirty years ago ( giacconi et al .",

    "these assumed parameters correspond to the conversion factor 1 ct / s = 2.26 @xmath22 at the center of the field .",
    "the last column gives the hardness ratio with its statistical error .",
    "since most of the detected x - ray sources are too faint to obtain a full resolution spectrum , we have characterized their spectra using the hardness ratio technique .",

    "we have cross  correlated the positions of the 50 x - ray sources within 15  from the center with those of 29 previously known optically selected agns with m@xmath23 22.5 in the same area ( zitelli et al .",
    "1992 ; mignoli et al . in preparation ) . we have found 19 positional coincidences , with distances smaller than 12between x - ray and optical positions , while less than 0.3 random coincidences are expected on a statistical basis .",
    "the average offset between x - ray and optical positions is about 4 in right ascension and less than 1 in declination , with no additional trend as a function of position in the field .",
    "the one sigma uncertainty for the offset in each coordinate is of the order of 0.9 .",
    "we have therefore applied this average offset to all the original x - ray positions and corrected the ml positional errors by adding in quadrature the uncertainty on the offset .",
    "both the positions and the positional errors given in table 1 are the `` corrected '' values .",
    "figure 1 shows a gray scale representation of the hard rosat image .",
    "the image has been slightly smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath24 = 10 .",
    "all the sources detected within a radius of 15  are labelled .",
    "the figure shows the capability of the maximum likelihood algorithm in retrieving pairs of sources relatively close to each other ( see , for example , the two pairs 49304 and 46301 , for which the distances between the x - ray positions are of the order  of  50  arcsec ) . for distances between two x - ray centroids smaller than @xmath540 , however , our detection algorithm is unable to separate the two x - ray sources and will find a single source ( hasinger et al .",
    "1993 ) , with a position intermediate between the two true positions . in these cases",
    "the resulting x - ray position and its associated error would not be reliable and this would lead to problems in the optical identification process .    in order to estimate how many such cases we may have in our list of sources we have simulated 1000 random samples with the same number of detected sources and with the same radial surface densities of sources as the real sample ( i.e. higher density in the inner region of the field and lower density in the outer region ) . for each sample",
    "we have then computed the number of sources which have a nearby companion at a distance smaller than the smallest observed distance in the real sample ( i.e. 48 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the normalized histogram of the number of such sources in the 1000 random samples .",
    "the figure shows that in only 2% of the cases there is no pair of sources with a distance smaller than 48  arcsec , while in the central 75% of the cases ( hatched area ) the number of such sources ranges from 4 to 10 .",
    "since each pair is counted twice in this histogram , this means that we may expect that in about 25 cases a single source in our list may be produced by two different close  by sources , so that its position may be significantly wrong and we may not be able to find any reliable optical counterpart within the error box .",
    "note that this estimate is based on purely geometric considerations ; moreover , since in computing the expected number of close  by sources we have adopted the observed surface density of sources , we are not considering in this order of magnitude estimate the cases in which one or both the sources in a close pair are below the detection limit .",
    "results from more detailed simulations , which take into account all the possible effects of source confusion , are discussed in hasinger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    figure 3 shows the hard x - ray flux versus the off  axis angle for all the x - ray sources listed in table 1 . even if we have considered only sources within 15  from the center , the limiting flux is not constant over the adopted field of view .",
    "its increase at distances greater than about 10  is mainly due to the increase of the width of the point spread function with the off - axis angle .",
    "the curve drawn in the figure shows our estimated limiting flux as a function of the off  axis angle for the complete sample .",
    "when corrected for the different sensitivity over the field , and using only the 48 sources with flux greater than the adopted limiting flux , the estimated observed surface density at @xmath1 is @xmath2 sources / sq.deg .",
    "this value is consistent with the surface density ( 248 sources / sq.deg . )",
    "derived by hasinger et al .",

    "we observed the marano field at 1.4 and 2.4 ghz with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the radio observations were carried out on 1994 january 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "details about the radio observation and data reduction are given in gruppioni et al .",

    "the radio limits are about 0.2 mjy at both frequencies .",
    "correlation of the entire radio and x - ray catalogs has produced four positional coincidences with a maximum difference of @xmath510between radio and x - ray positions .",
    "all these distances are between 1.1 and 2.4 times the combined x - ray and radio positional error ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "fifteen more radio  x - ray pairs have distances smaller than 90 , but none has a distance smaller than 25 . for all these pairs the distances between radio and x - ray positions",
    "are larger than five times the combined positional error and can therefore be considered random coincidences . > from the number of these random pairs we estimate that the expected number of similarly random pairs within 10is 0.20 @xmath17 0.05 .",
    "if , instead of using a radius of 10 , which can be considered an `` a posteriori '' choice , we use for each x - ray source a radius corresponding to the 95% error circle , the estimated number of random pairs inside the 95% area becomes 0.40 . on this basis",
    "we conclude that probably none and at most one of the observed radio  x - ray coincidences is not real .",
    "the four radio  x - ray pairs correspond to a percentage of radio detection of 8@xmath174% for our x - ray sources at a radio limit of @xmath5 0.2 mjy . of the same order ( 10@xmath175% )",
    "is the percentage of x - ray detections for our sample of radio sources .",
    "both these percentages are in good agreement with what has been found by de ruiter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from vla observations in the region of the lockman hole .",
    "table 2 lists these four radio  x - ray pairs , where the columns are x - ray number and flux from table 1 , radio number and flux from the 20 cm catalog in gruppioni et al . 1997 , difference in position ( @xmath27 ) in arcsec and normalized to the combined x - ray and radio error ( @xmath27/@xmath28 ) .",
    "three of these four radio  x - ray pairs have ben optically identified ( see section 3.2 ) .",

    "1992 ) , in the years 19921994 we have obtained a set of u , b , v , r ccd images at the eso ntt .",
    "the v and r images cover @xmath5 90% of the circle with 15  radius and contain all but one of the x - ray sources within this radius ; the u and b images , which have a smaller field of view , cover a smaller fraction of the 15  field , but still contain 45 out of 50 x - ray sources .",
    "details about the observations , data reduction and optical catalogs obtained from these ccd observations will be given elsewhere ( mignoli et al . in preparation",
    "; see also mignoli 1997 ) .",
    "the ccd limiting magnitudes vary from field to field , but typically are of the order of 23.5 in u , 25.0 in b , 24.0 in v and r. the typical surface density of objects at these limits is @xmath5 60,000 per square degree . since the total area covered by the 2@xmath24  ( 3@xmath24 ) error circles of the 50 x - ray sources corresponds to 5.4  ( 10.4 ) sq.arcmin .",
    ", this implies a total expected number of @xmath5  90  ( 175 ) catalogued objects inside the x - ray error boxes . in table 3 we report the optical data for all the objects in our optical catalogs within a 3@xmath24 error box , plus a few interesting objects at slightly larger distance .",
    "( we recall that , under the assumption that the distribution function of the positional errors follows a circular normal distribution , the 1@xmath24 , 2@xmath24 and 3@xmath24 error boxes correspond to radii equal to 1.51 , 2.45 and 3.4 times the error in each coordinate , respectively . )",
    "the first ten columns in the table give the x - ray number , the distance in right ascension and declination between the x - ray source and the optical objects ( arcsec ) , the total distance both in arcsec and normalized to the x - ray positional error ( ) as defined in section 2.1 , and r magnitudes and , , colours and a morphological classification ( p for point - like source , e for extended , p / e or e / p for sources classified differently in the blue and red bands ) .",
    "the morphological classification is reliable only for objects which are more than @xmath5 1.5 magnitudes brighter than the limiting magnitude ( flynn , gould and bahcall 1996 ) .",
    "an asterisk in the magnitude columns means that the magnitudes have been measured from the plates and then converted to the johnson system ( see gruppioni , mignoli and zamorani 1999 ) .",
    "the next two columns give the likelihood ratio ( lr ) computed from the b and r data .",
    "these lr values have been computed following the procedure described by sutherland and saunders ( 1992 ) , which , differently from previous formulations , has been shown to be valid also in the case of multiple candidates in the error boxes .",
    "for each optical object its likelihood ratio is defined as :    @xmath30    where @xmath31(x , y ) is the probability distribution function of the positional errors , @xmath32(m , c ) is the surface density of `` background '' objects with magnitude m and type c and @xmath33(m , c ) is the probability distribution function in magnitude and type of the optical counterparts . with this definition lr",
    "is the ratio between the probability of finding the true optical counterpart with the observed offset ( x , y ) from the x - ray position and the observed magnitude and the probability of finding a similar chance background object ( see eq . 1 and related discussion in sutherland and saunders 1992 ) . assuming that the distribution function of the positional errors is gaussian ,    @xmath34    where x and y are the offsets in right ascension and declination between the optical and x - ray sources and @xmath24",
    "is the positional error in each coordinate ( see column 4 in table 1 ) .",
    "we considered two different types of optical objects , i.e. point  like and extended .",
    "for each of them the observed @xmath32(m ) has been obtained from our own ccd data , while @xmath33(m ) has been estimated from the magnitude distribution of the excess of objects in the 50 x - ray error boxes with respect to the expected number of `` background '' objects .",
    "the last two columns give the redshift and the classification of the objects based on our spectroscopic data .",
    "objects which we consider to be the correct identification are written in bold face in the last column . when the spectroscopic data suggest identification with a group or cluster of galaxies , all the galaxies at the redshift of the cluster are shown in bold face .",
    "figure 4 shows the finding charts for all the x - ray sources within 15 , ordered by decreasing x - ray flux , and , when available , the spectrum of the most likely identification . for completeness",
    "we show here also the spectra of the previously known , optically selected agns already published in zitelli et al .",
    "for all sources the optical images ( 1@xmath351 ) are taken from r ccds , except for sources x04603 , x24009 and x04527 , for which the images from the f plate are shown .",
    "the two circles drawn on the figures correspond to the 68% and 95% error boxes as defined above .",
    "the total number of objects in the 95% error boxes is @xmath5  140 .",
    "spectroscopy for such a large number of faint objects was obviously not possible , and therefore we had to decide a strategy for the follow  up spectroscopic observations of the most promising candidates .",
    "our adopted strategy was the following :    \\i .",
    "first we have cross  correlated the positions of the 50 x - ray sources with those of the 29 optically selected agns previously known in the same area , finding 19 positional coincidences ( see section 2.1 ) . with one exception ( x01917 ) , all these agns have at least one of the two lr values higher than 1.6 .",
    "we have considered them as likely identifications ( these objects are indicated as * agn@xmath36 * in the last column of table 3 ) and we decided not to observe spectroscopically other objects in these error boxes , including the x - ray source x01917 in which the agn has a relatively low likelihood ratio .",
    "we note here that our lr values are based only on optical magnitudes and morphology and do not take into account the spectroscopic information . at the typical magnitudes of the optical counterparts identified with agns ( 21 @xmath37 23 ) the ratio between the number of objects classified as point  like objects in our ccd data and that of broad  line agns ( mignoli and zamorani 1998 ) is in the range 1015 .",
    "therefore , the `` a posteriori '' lr , when an agn is found spectroscopically in any given error box , would be about 1015 times higher than that listed in table 3 .    \\ii . since agns are well known to be the dominant optical counterpart of faint x - ray sources , at least for @xmath38",
    ", we have then searched our optical catalogs for all the stellar or slightly fuzzy objects within the remaining 31 x - ray error boxes .",
    "we have then taken spectra for these objects helping us in making a priority list in each error box with additional information from the colours , the magnitude and the distance between the objects and the x  centroid ( i.e. the lr value ) .",
    "in addition to the objects that on the basis of these data were considered to be the most likely agn candidates , we gave high priority also to objects which coincide with a radio source ( see table 2 ) and to objects with colours typical of m stars , which are the dominant spectral type of stars found in faint x - ray surveys .",
    "m stars with the highest ratio between x - ray and optical fluxes and with an x - ray flux equal to our limiting flux are expected to have at most an optical magnitude of the order of @xmath39 ( see maccacaro et al .",
    "1988 ) , corresponding to @xmath40 . from our own colour  colour diagrams ( see also marano et al .",
    "1988 ) we estimate that the surface density of m stars with this limiting magnitude is @xmath5 380 per square degree , in good agreement ( within 15% ) with the predictions of the bahcall and soneira model for the structure of the galaxy ( see , for example , ratnatunga and bahcall 1985 ) . following this recipe",
    ", we found spectroscopically four stars ( two m stars with @xmath41 ( x03015 and x02833 ) , and two very bright f stars with @xmath42 ( x04603 and x04527 ) ) , eight broad - line agns ( x01202 , x04211 , x04032 , x03236 , x25137 , x02438 , x01539 , x30642 ) and two radio galaxies ( x02105 and x40928 ) , one of which with broad mgii line .",
    "the blue magnitudes of the agns and the two radio galaxies are in the range @xmath43 .",
    "we also took a spectrum for the relatively bright object ( @xmath44 = 21.44 ) , with lr values greater than 5.5 , which is right at the center of the error box of source x05143 .",
    "its spectrum does not show any clear evidence for convincing emission or absorption features , so that , even if we do consider it as the likely counterpart of the x - ray source , we have not been able to spectroscopically classify it .",
    "the absence of features in the spectrum suggests that it might be a bl lac object .",
    "if so , it would be a somewhat anomalous bl lac object .",
    "in fact , being not detected in the radio at a flux limit of about 0.2 mjy , it would be classified as a radio quiet bl lac , with a radio to optical spectral index @xmath450.26 . none of the x - ray selected bl lac objects in the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) , and just a few in the much larger samples of rosat selected bl lacs ( see , for example , perlman et al .",
    "1998 ) have such a low value of @xmath46 .",

    "figure 6 shows the x - ray flux versus @xmath60 magnitudes for the sources in our sample and for the agns identified in the lockman field ( schmidt et al .",
    "the two bright f stars ( @xmath57 10 ) are not shown here .",
    "the two straight dashed lines , corresponding to constant x - ray to optical ratios , show the approximate locus of this plane which contains most of the identified agns , both in our sample and in the lockman field .",
    "this range in x - ray to optical fluxes correspond to -0.6 @xmath68 0.6 , where @xmath69 is defined as in maccacaro et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . for any given x - ray flux",
    "the range in magnitude is about @xmath17 1.5 , corresponding to about @xmath17 a factor of 4 with respect to the average x - ray to optical ratio . despite the much higher x - ray flux limit and ,",
    "correspondingly , much brighter limiting magnitudes , also most ( @xmath5 90% ) of the emss agns lie in the same band .",
    "for the three sources identified with groups or clusters of galaxies we have plotted the magnitude of the brightest galaxies .",
    "the two x - ray sources identified with galaxies have an x - ray to optical ratio close to the lower limit of those of agns .",
    "the limits for the eight unidentified sources are plotted at the magnitude of the brightest object within the 95% error box which is not excluded from being the optical counterpart on the basis of the available spectra .",
    "three of these upper limits lie outside the band shown in the figure and three more are very close to the upper bound of this band .",
    "if associated with agns , they would have an x - ray to optical ratio significantly higher than the average .",
    "as shown in the figure , 6 such agns have been identified in the lockman field ; four of them are classical broad line objects , while the other two , showing only narrow lines , have been classified as agns on the basis of the presence of [ nev]@xmath703426 emission ( schmidt et al .",
    "the hri arcsec positions in the lockman field has made these identifications with such faint optical objects possible . in our case , with the 95% error radius for these sources ranging from 8to 24 , similar identifications are significantly more difficult .",
    "alternatively , we can not exclude that some of these sources may have a `` wrong '' position because of confusion . in section 2",
    "we have estimated that in about 25 cases a single source in our list may be produced by two different close  by sources , so that its position may be significantly wrong and we may not be able to find any reliable optical counterpart within the error box . the much more detailed simulations performed by hasinger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that in a pspc survey like ours up to almost 20% of the detected sources with @xmath71 ( corresponding to about 7 sources ) may appear at a detected position more than 15away from the true position because of confusion . from these considerations",
    "it follows that only higher resolution , deep x - ray data ( e.g. with axaf and xmm ) can fully clarify the situation for these sources .",
    "some additional clues on the nature of the unidentified sources can be obtained from the analysis of the hardness ratio .",
    "figure 7 shows the hardness ratio versus x - ray flux for the sources in the marano field ( panel a ) and in the lockman field ( panel b ) .",
    "analysis of this figure shows the following results :    \\i .",
    "most of the sources in both fields occupy well defined bands in hr . on average , the observed hardness ratio values in the lockman field",
    "are smaller than those in the marano field .",
    "the reason for this shift in hr is essentially due to the lower @xmath72 value in the lockman field , so that the observed spectra appear softer .",
    "when converted to energy spectral indices , under the assumption of a single power law with the galactic @xmath72 , the hr band in the marano field corresponds to the range 0.5 @xmath73 2.0 .",
    "approximately the same range in @xmath19 is derived for the hr band in the lockman field assuming @xmath74 , i.e. approximately twice the value of atomic hydrogen derived from measurements in the 21 cm line ( lockman et al . 1986 ) .",
    "a similar @xmath72 value was derived by hasinger et al .",
    "( 1993 ) when fitting the average spectrum of all the x - ray sources in the lockman field .",
    "this excess of x - ray absorption is consistent with the column density of ionized gas in the galactic disk derived from analyses of the dispersion measures of pulsars ( reynolds 1989 ) .",
    "the presence of this additional column of ionised gas should be taken into account when analyzing rosat data , particularly in directions of low @xmath72 as , for example , in the lockman field .",
    "\\ii . in both samples there",
    "are about ( 1520)% of the sources which appear to have hard or absorbed spectra , with hr values close to 1 .",
    "these sources appear to be reasonably well separated from the others , especially in the lockman field where , because of the higher s / n ratio , the errors in hr are smaller .",
    "the fraction of sources without optical identification is significantly higher among these hard sources than among sources with `` normal '' x - ray spectrum .",
    "for example , in the lockman field the unidentified sources are 3 out of 8 for sources with hr @xmath50 0.6 , to be compared with zero out of 42 for sources with hr @xmath51 0.6 ; in the marano field the corresponding fractions of unidentified sources in the same hr ranges are 6/12 and 2/38 . the eleven identifications ( lockman and marano fields together ) among these hard sources comprise 2 galaxies ( x26450 and x02248 ) , and 9 agns ( 4 broad line agns , 2 radio galaxies , 1 possible bl lac , and 2 narrow line objects classified as agns on the basis of the presence of [ nev]@xmath703426 ) .",
    "this shows that agns are the dominant population also in this range of hr .",
    "however , contrary to what happens for objects with `` normal '' x - ray spectra , a relatively large fraction of them does not show the prominent broad lines typical of classical quasars .",
    "the absence of broad lines coupled with the presence of x - ray absorption are consistent with the standard unified models for agns .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two narrow line objects with [ nev]@xmath703426 have two of the highest x - ray to optical ratios in the lockman field sample .",
    "since the current optical limits for the unidentified sources in the marano field correspond to x - ray to optical ratios similar to those of these sources , it is possible that at least some of our hard , unidentified sources belong to the same class of objects .",
    "in both samples , but especially in the marano field , the hard sources tend to be more numerous at low flux levels .",
    "while this is likely to be , at least in part , a real effect , as shown by the identification content of these sources discussed above , there is also an obvious selection effect which favours hard spectra near the detection limit . at these fluxes , because of the combined effect of confusion and statistical fluctuations on small number of counts , a not ",
    "negligible fraction of the detected sources has measured fluxes significantly higher than the true fluxes ( see hasinger et al .",
    "since the sample is defined in the rosat hard band , the measured hardness ratio for some of these sources would be biased toward large values and therefore the observed fraction of hard sources is probably higher than the real one .      as mentioned in section 1 , in the same area covered by the x - ray survey we have conducted in the past years a search for optically selected agns , using multi - colour data from plates taken at the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "( zitelli et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this survey has later been extended to fainter magnitudes using ccd data ( mignoli et al . in preparation ) and has produced , so far , spectroscopic data for 29 optically selected broad  line agns inside the rosat area .",
    "ten of these have not been detected in the x - ray data and their corresponding x - ray upper limits are shown in figure 6 .",
    "three of these agns have x - ray upper limits outside the band shown in figure 6 , in the area of very low x - ray to optical ratio .    on the basis of the available ccd and spectroscopic data , which do not cover the entire rosat area of about 0.2 sq.deg . ,",
    "mignoli and zamorani ( 1998 ) estimate surface densities of @xmath5 185 and 140 agns per sq.deg . with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "these estimates are in good agreement with the predictions obtained by zamorani ( 1995 ) on the basis of reasonable extrapolations from counts at slightly brighter magnitudes . limiting ourselves at the classical broad  line agns and merging together the x - ray and the optically selected samples",
    ", we have a total of 35 such objects with @xmath75 22.6 corresponding to a surface density of 178 @xmath17 30 broad  line agns per sq.deg .",
    "this is the highest reported surface density for these objects so far at this magnitude .",
    "taking into account that , as mentioned above , the optically selected sample is not complete over the entire rosat area , this density is significantly higher than the estimate of about 125 agns per sq.deg . with @xmath76",
    "recently obtained in the deep multicolor survey , on the basis of 53 spectroscopically confirmed agns ( kennefick et al .",
    "our estimated surface densities for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath78 agns inside the rosat area . since in the same magnitude",
    "ranges rosat has detected 23 and 6 broad  line agns respectively , we conclude that the `` efficiency '' of agn selection with x - ray exposures reaching about @xmath4 is @xmath5 65% and @xmath5 20% in the two magnitude ranges .",
    "having colours for all the x - ray selected agns , we can also estimate how many of them would have been missed by a purely optical selection .",
    "figure 8 shows , with different symbols ( see figure caption ) all known agns in our field .",
    "the small dots represent all the point  like objects in our ccd data with @xmath75 22.5 .",
    "the dotted curve shows the approximate locus occupied by stars in this plane .",
    "this figure shows that two x - ray selected agns ( x25137 at z = 2.71 and x04211 at z = 1.062 ) are inside the star locus and therefore would have not been easily selected as agn candidates on the basis of this diagram .",
    "moreover , two x - ray selected agns ( x23345 at z = 1.180 , and x40928 , the broad line radio galaxy at z = 0.958 ) are classified as extended by our morphological algorithm and two more ( x04312 , the agn2 at z = 2.80 , and x21122 at z = 0.281 ) have uncertain classification ( i.e. p / e in table 3 ) . since the colour - colour area occupied by faint agns contains a number of extended objects which is about ten times higher than that of the point  like ones ,",
    "also these four objects would have not been easily selected as agn candidates by purely optical data . moreover , the location of these objects in the magnitude ",
    "redshift plane is not the same as that of agns which are more easily selected optically ; five have @xmath61 22.2 and only one has @xmath79 22.2 , while the corresponding numbers for all the other agns with redshift in this field are 11 and 25 .",
    "the same difference is also visible as a function of the absolute magnitude : five of the objects which would have been more difficult to detect from the optical data have @xmath80 -22.4 and only one has @xmath81 -22.4 , while the corresponding numbers for all the other agns are 14 and 22 .",
    "this clearly shows that not only colour  colour selection of agn candidates among point ",
    "like objects can be significantly incomplete at faint apparent magnitudes , but also the incompleteness increases at faint absolute magnitudes . as a consequence , if these not so stellar agns were really missed in faint optical surveys , this would introduce a bias in the derived optical luminosity function , which would appear flatter than the real one .",
    "finally , we note also that a not negligible number of x - ray selected agns are significantly redder in b - v than the bulk of agns ( see figure 8) .",
    "also this has to be taken into account in devising the most efficient optical selection criteria for faint agn candidates .",
    "we have presented the x - ray data and the optical identifications for a deep rosat pspc observation in the marano field .",
    "careful statistical analysis of multi  colour ccd data in the error boxes of the 50 x - ray sources detected in the inner region of the rosat field ( 15  radius ) has led to the identification of 42 sources , corresponding to 84% of the x - ray sample .",
    "these 42 reliable identifications are 33 agns ( including two radio galaxies and one bl lac candidate ; 79% of the identified sources ) , 2 galaxies , 3 groups or clusters of galaxies and 4 stars . except for the higher fraction of unidentified sources ,",
    "the identification content of this sample is in excellent agreement with what has been found , at a similar flux limit , in the much deeper pspc and hri surveys in the lockman field ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 , schmidt et al . 1998 ) .    with simple simulations",
    "we have shown that in a few cases the reason for not having found an optical identification can be due to the fact that a single x - ray source in our list may be produced by two different close  by sources , so that its detected position may be significantly wrong .",
    "most of the unidentified sources have a large ratio of x - ray to optical fluxes and harder than average x - ray spectra .",
    "since most of the identified objects with these characteristics in our field and in the lockman field are agns , we conclude that most of the sources with good position determination but without identification are likely to be agns .",
    "most of the sources in the marano and lockman fields occupy well defined bands in the plane hardness ratio versus x - ray flux .",
    "these bands correspond to the same energy spectral index range 0.5 @xmath73 2.0 , only if the effective x - ray absorbing column in the lockman field is about twice the value of atomic hydrogen derived from measurements in the 21 cm line . in both samples there",
    "are about ( 1520)% of the sources which appear to have hard or absorbed spectra , with hr values close to 1 and , especially in the marano field , they tend to be more numerous at low flux levels",
