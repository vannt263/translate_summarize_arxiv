    "galactic black hole transients are binary systems that undergo sporadic outbursts that last for months . during an outburst",
    ", they exhibit two main x - ray spectral states : the hard state and the soft state . in the soft state",
    "the x - ray energy spectra are dominated by a thermal disk component , and weak or no variability is observed ; whereas in the hard state , the x - ray energy spectra are dominated by a non - thermal component , and high variability is observed .",
    "there also exists intermediate states in which the x - ray properties of the systems do not suit to the main states , but present the properties of a mixture of both states ( see @xcite for the details of the spectral states ) .",
    "besides the correlated x - ray spectral and temporal properties , black hole transients also show state dependent radio , optical and infrared ( oir ) properties . in the soft state ,",
    "the radio emission is quenched @xcite indicating the jet turning off . in the hard state ,",
    "compact steady jets are observed @xcite . therefore , from observational point of view the transitions from the soft to the hard state",
    "serve the perfect conditions to study the properties of the accretion flow for jet formation .",
    "also in the hard state , the x - ray flux is positively correlated with both the radio flux @xcite and the oir flux @xcite .",
    "these relations suggest a common origin between the jet emission and x - rays .",
    "some jet models assume that a hot electron corona is the base of the jet to explain these relations @xcite . there are also reports of direct jet synchrotron emission dominating the entire x - ray emission in the hard state at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "softening of the x - ray spectrum observed in some sources @xcite at very low flux levels also suggests a change in the x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "the x - ray observations of gx 339 - 4 in january 2010 revealed the start of an outburst @xcite .",
    "its multiwavelength observations during the rise and spectral properties during the state transitions have been reported elsewhere @xcite . in january 2011",
    ", the source made a transition from the intermediate to the hard state during the outburst decay @xcite .",
    "the optical observations through the end of february 2011 revealed a rebrightening @xcite which was also observed in previous outburst decays of gx 339 - 4 @xcite . here , we report the results of _ rxte , swift _ , and smarts observations of gx 339 - 4 in 2011 decay .",
    "we characterize the evolution of the x - ray spectral , temporal , and oir photometric properties , and produce spectral energy distributions ( sed ) in order to investigate the jet - disk connection .",
    "the outburst decay was amply covered with 54 pointed _ rxte _ observations between mjd 55,560 and 55,650 ( 2010 december 30 and 2011 march 30 ) .",
    "however , some observations were not statistically satisfactory due to the short good time intervals ( gti ) and/or small number of proportional counter unit ( pcu ) on during the operation .",
    "therefore , we did not include the observations with gti @xmath1 500 s ( see table  [ paramt ] for a log of observations ) .",
    "we used data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument onboard the _ rxte _ for the spectral analysis @xcite . in most of the observations ,",
    "the spectra were extracted in the 3 - 25 kev energy band , but in a few cases for which the noise dominated above 20 kev , we used the 3 - 20 kev band .",
    "the response matrix , and the background model were created using the standard ftools ( v6.11 ) programs .",
    "we added 0.5% systematic error to the energy spectra following the suggestions of the _ rxte _ team .",
    "the spectral analysis were performed using xspec 12.0.7 @xcite .",
    "we employed a spectral model for the continuum that consists of absorption , a multicolour disk black - body and a power law .",
    "we also included a phenomenological smeared edge model @xcite for the iron @xmath2 absorption edge seen around 7.1 kev to obtain acceptable @xmath3 values for the observations before mjd 55,606 .",
    "in the spectral fits , the hydrogen column density , @xmath4 , and the smeared edge width were fixed at @xmath5 @xcite and 10 kev , respectively .",
    "this model was used previously in @xcite .",
    "the galactic ridge emission was an important factor for the faint observations . in order to estimate its spectrum we compared quasi - simultaneous _ rxte _ and _ chandra _ observations obtained on mjd 52,911 .",
    "we combined seven rxte / pca observations taken on the same day and fitted with a model consisting of interstellar absorption , a power law and a gaussian to represent the galactic ridge emission , and a second power law to represent the source .",
    "the centroid energy and width of gaussian was fixed at 6.6 kev and 0.5 kev respectively .",
    "the parameters of the second power law from the source was set to the values obtained from _",
    "observation @xcite . with this method we modelled the galactic ridge emission with a power law index of 2.1 and an unabsorbed flux of 7.55 @xmath6 10@xmath7 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath9 in the 3 - 25 kev band @xcite .",
    "we applied galactic ridge emission correction to the spectra , fluxes and rms amplitudes of the observations after mjd 55,627 .",
    "the contamination from galactic ridge emission was not greater than 3% of the total flux for the observations before this date .    for each pca observation , we produced power density spectrum ( pds ) from segments of length 256 s with a time resolution of 2@xmath10 s in 3 - 30 kev energy band using idl programs developed at university of tbingen .",
    "the averaged pds were normalized as described in @xcite and corrected for the dead time effects according to @xcite .",
    "then , pds were fit using lorentzians in 0.004 - 256 hz range .",
    "the rms amplitudes are obtained by integrating the normalized pds and corrected for both the background and the ridge emission as described in @xcite .",
    "all spectral and timing results are presented in table  [ paramt ] .",
    "we also analyzed _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observations conducted at the same time period with the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "we found 12 observations carried out between mjd 55,622 and 55,647 .",
    "we used them together with the _ rxte _ observations and looked for presence of any spectral softening .",
    "we analyzed the xrt photon counting mode event data using xrtpipeline task provided in ftools package .",
    "pile up was an issue for the first four observations whose count rate were greater than 1 c / s . to remove its effects , following the swift science data center ( ssdc ) recommendations , we selected the source photons from a ring with an inner radius of 5@xmath11 and an outer radius of 40@xmath11 .",
    "for the rest of the observations , the source photons were selected in a circular region with a radius of 40@xmath11 .",
    "the background photons were accumulated from a ring with an inner radius of 70@xmath11 and an outer radius of 100@xmath11 centered at the source position .    for the spectral analysis ,",
    "only events with grades 0 - 12 were selected .",
    "the auxiliary response files were created by xrtmkarf and corrected using the exposure maps , and the standard response matrix swxpc0to12s6_20010101v013.rmf was used .",
    "we binned the energy spectra by fixing the number of counts per bin at 50 .",
    "we fitted the spectra with a model that consists of photoabsorption and a power law in 0.6 - 8.0 kev band . in our initial spectral runs , we let the @xmath4 free , and the resulting values were between @xmath12 .",
    "as we were not able to constrain the @xmath4 , we performed a second run with @xmath4 fixed at @xmath5 .",
    "the log of _ swift _ observations and the spectral results are presented in table  [ paramt ] .",
    "the regular optical / infrared observations were performed with the andicam @xcite camera on the smarts 1.3 m telescope in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",

    "we refer to the discussion section for the explanation of the lines in figure  [ seds ] .",
    "the changes observed in both the spectral and the temporal parameters imply a change in accretion dynamics .",
    "the most clear changes in both the x - ray spectral and temporal parameters occurred on mjd 55,594 .",
    "we marked this date as the start of the transition from soft - intermediate state towards the hard state . throughout the the decay phase of the outburst , gx 339 - 4 generally presented typical x - ray and oir behaviour as observed from other black holes , and also of its previous outburst decays .",
    "in the soft - intermediate state , the evolution in x - ray and oir regimes was quite typical .",
    "smoothly decaying disk temperature and disk flux may imply presence of a steadily cooling accretion disk .",
    "variable power law flux with a variable soft photon index can be thought as arising from a variable corona which have some overlap with the accretion disk that provides strong cooling .",
    "the emission mechanism that produces the power law component is most probably the thermal comptonization @xcite .    after the start of state transition ,",
    "the disk temperature and the disk flux rapidly decayed and remained out of the pca energy range in about ten days . as the disk is thought to be the source of seed photons in the comptonization process ,",
    "this is most often interpreted as the reduction in the number of soft seed photons .",
    "this results in a less cooling of the corona , and higher electron temperature which is consistent with the observed hardening of photon index .",
    "this simple comptonization scenario could change or be modified with the onset of compact jet . because the jet can either provide additional source of seed photons from non - thermal synchrotron emission at the base of jet ( corona ) and channel some portion of the accretion energy into its own power @xcite .",
    "these processes could provide a sharp increase in the rms amplitude of variability @xcite and/or a softening of the x - ray spectrum @xcite , however no such sharp changes in the x - ray spectral and temporal properties were observed during rebrightening in the oir .      at the initial decay ( between mjd 55,585 and 55,605 ,",
    "see figure  [ mwlc ] ) , the oir flux was most probably dominated by the thermal emission originating from the outer parts of the accretion disk as the secondary star is not expected to contribute to the oir flux significantly @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the higher spectral slopes observed compared to the slopes during the rebrightening ( see figure  [ sedall ] ) .",
    "additionally , the spectral slope of 1.34 @xmath19 0.16 in this stage is lower than the expected spectral index from the rayleigh jeans tail of the black body ( @xmath50 ) and seems consistent with the x - ray irradiation of the disk @xcite .",
    "the strong variability in the light curve in the intermediate state also supports x - ray irradiation .",
    "furthermore , recent optical and near - infrared spectroscopic observations at the soft state suggests that the irradiation might be enhanced due to a larger illumination area provided by a warped disk , and/or the winds launched at large radii of the accretion disk that up - scatter part of the x - ray and/or uv emission @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of oir rebrightening in the hard state decay is similar to those observed in other black hole binaries 4u 1543 - 47 @xcite and xte j1550 - 564 @xcite , xte j1752 - 223 @xcite .",
    "such a rebrightening has also been observed in 2003 , 2005 and 2007 hard state decays of gx 339 - 4 @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the rebrigtening occurs at an x - ray luminosity range of 0.08 % to 2% @xmath51 ( kalemci et al . in prep . ) .",
    "4u 1543 - 47 @xcite , xte j1550 - 564 @xcite and xte j1752 - 223 @xcite have shown radio revival sometime during the rebrightening , but the coverage for these cases were not adequate to describe radio behavior during the oir rise . for 4u 1543 - 47 , xte j1550 - 564 and xte j1752 - 223 ,",
    "the sed of the excess during the rebrightening has indicated clear negative slope which is consistent with the optically thin synchrotron emission from a compact jet , and an extrapolation from radio to oir matches well with a flat or slightly inverted spectral slopes .",
    "gx 339 - 4 during the rebrightening in the 2005 hard state decay showed similar radio - oir seds @xcite . note that rebrightening in the hard state decay of gx 339 - 4 in 2011 is also associated with radio revival ( s. corbel , private comm . ) , hence it is natural to assume that the rebrightening has jet origin .",
    "we have produced two broadband seds from the rise and the peak of the rebrightening .",
    "unlike 4u 1543 - 47 and xte j1550 - 564 for which a clear negative slope is present , our baseline subtracted seds indicate a flat to slightly inverted spectrum ( see figure  [ seds ] ) . assuming that the excess is from the jet",
    ", we tried to obtain the break frequency for the change from an optically thick to an optically thin synchrotron emission , which is an important parameter in determining the base radius of the jet , magnetic field and minimum total jet power @xcite .",
    "the flat seds may indicate that all oir points lie on the optically thick part . in this case",
    "the break is around the v band , or at a higher frequency , which places a constraint on the slope of the optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "a power law fit from v - band that passes through the softest x - ray band would give the spectral slopes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for mjd 55,609.84 and 55,617.53 , respectively ( the dot - dashed lines in figure  [ seds ] ) .",
    "these slopes are a lower limit to the possible absolute slopes that do not provide x - ray fluxes higher than the observed ones .",
    "the former is a typical spectral slope expected from an optically thin synchrotron jet emission , but the latter is above the given range @xmath54 @xcite depending on the lepton energy distribution . if the spectral slopes as steep as 1.5 for xte j1550 - 564 @xcite and xte j1752 - 223 @xcite are possible at the beginning of the oir rebrightening , then the particle distributions inferred from seds would not be problematic .",
    "if the break is at the v band , however , the ratio of the minimum integrated synchrotron power to the x - ray luminosity is @xmath55=0.18 and 0.95 for the seds on mjd 55,609.84 and mjd 55,617.53 , respectively . for this calculation",
    ", we considered only the optically thick part of the seds and assummed a conservative jet radiative efficiency of 0.05 following @xcite .",
    "the reported ratios for gx 339 - 4 are in between 0.05 - 0.10 @xcite and the maximum value reported so far is for xte j1118 + 480 which is 0.20 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of 0.95 is too high to be accounted by scale - invariant jet models @xcite .",
    "the ratio decreases down to 0.32 for a break at the h band for this observation , and 0.05 for the observation on mjd 55,609.84 .",
    "the typical break frequencies reported so far for gx 339 - 4 are in the mid - infrared @xcite to infrared range @xcite .    on the other hand , if we place the break at h - band or at a lower frequency , we encounter a problem with a simple post - shock emission model . in figure",
    "[ seds ] , the dashed lines show the limiting cases of the power laws that can be fitted from h - band to softest x - ray band .",
    "the other three oir bands remain significantly above the power law even when the errors are considered .",
    "this shows that the entire excess sed can not be explained by optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet . @xcite",
    "have studied seds from a similar stage of the hard state decay and claimed that significant reprocessing may be present during the oir rebrightening . in this work ,",
    "we show that even taking out the baseline emission that comes with reprocessing , there is still an excess . if a spectral break occurs at / below the h - band , it either must have two components ( such as pre - shock synchrotron , @xcite ) or a simple flat to inverted spectrum breaking in the near or mid infrared is not a good description of the jet behavior during its launch .",
    "such an additional component has recently been observed by @xcite .",
    "a full sed fitting ( including radio fluxes ) that takes into account the emission from different parts of the jet is required to find the break frequency , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also extrapolated a power law ( dotted lines ) with spectral index obtained from x - ray spectral analysis down to the oir band .",
    "in both days , the power law remained substantially below the oir .",
    "this shows that the x - ray spectra can not be explained by pure synchrotron emission without assuming a second emission component from the jet , at least during the early part of the oir rebrightening .",
    "x - rays dominated by direct jet emission scenario such as stated in @xcite is also dismissed in @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron - self compton models are also able to explain the broadband nature of jet emission @xcite .",
    "however a detailed analysis of such models are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have found that the oir light curves on the rise of the rebrightening are modulated with the binary period of the system ( @xmath221.77 days ) .",
    "this can be explained with the x - ray irradiation of the secondary star by the hard photons originating from the corona .",
    "then , we need to explain why we do not detect variations with the binary period before the rebrightening , and after the peak of the oir light curve . between mjd 55,580 and 55,605 ( before the rebrightening ) , the power - law flux is relatively high , however , the spectral indices are still high . during this time , the size of the corona may be relatively small , and therefore can not illuminate the secondary star effectively while still effectively illuminating the warped disk . during this time , variations in the oir flux from the disk is larger than the variations with the binary period .",
    "when the corona becomes larger , as indicated by the changes in the spectral index and the flux , it not only illuminates the secondary star effectively , but also allows the magnetic flux to travel in close to the black hole , aiding in the launch of the jet @xcite . at the peak ,",
    "the lack of modulations with the binary period is most likely due to the strongly variable jet synchrotron @xcite dominating the emission in all bands .",
    "after the peak , the x - ray power law flux decreases so much that it can not produce significant irradiation on the surface of the secondary star . in figure",
    "[ mwlc ] , the decrease in the x - ray power law flux after mjd 55,607 is accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of variations in v - band which is in favour of x - ray irradiation of secondary star .",
