    "one of the motivations for using distributed multisensor networks is to make the network resilient to loss of communication .",
    "this has led to an extensive research into distributed filtering over networks with time - varying , randomly switching topology . in particular , the markovian approach to the analysis and synthesis of estimator networks has received a significant attention in relation to the problems involving random data loss in channels with memory which are governed by a markov switching rule  @xcite .",
    "in addition to capturing memory properties of physical communication channels , markovian models allow for other random events in the network , such as sensor failures and recovery , to be considered in a systematic manner within the markov jump systems framework .",
    "however , the markov jump systems theory usually assumes the complete state of the underlying markov chain to be known to every controller or filter  @xcite . in the context of distributed estimation and control , this requires each node of the network to know the complete instantaneous state of the network to be able to deploy suitable gains . to circumvent such an unrealistic assumption",
    ", the literature focuses on networks whose communication state is governed by a random process decomposable into independent two - state markov processes describing the status of individual links  @xcite , even though this typically leads to design conditions whose complexity grows exponentially  @xcite .",
    "also , the assumption of independence between communication links may not always be practical , e.g. , when dealing with congestions .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop a distributed filtering technique which overcomes the need for broadcast of global communication topology and does not require markovian segmentation of the network .",
    "our main contribution is the methodology of robust distributed observer design which enables the node observers to be implemented in a truly distributed fashion , by utilizing only locally available information about the system s connectivity , and without assuming the independence of communication links .",
    "this information structure constraint is a key distinction of this work , compared with the existing results , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition , the proposed methodology allows to incorporate other random events such as sensor failures and recoveries .",
    "the paper focuses on the case where the plant to be observed , as well as sensing and communication models are not known perfectly . to deal with uncertain perturbations in the plant , sensors and communications",
    ", we employ the distributed @xmath0 filtering framework which has received a significant deal of attention in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering @xmath0 observers in this paper , instead of kalman filters  @xcite , is to obtain observers that have guaranteed robustness properties .",
    "it is well known that the standard kalman filter is sensitive to modelling errors  @xcite , and consensus kalman filters may potentially suffer from the same shortcomings .",
    "this explains our interest in robust performance guarantees in the presence of uncertainty .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , in this paper the node estimators are sought to reach relative @xmath0 consensus about the estimate of the reference plant . as an extension of the consensus estimation methodology  @xcite",
    ", our approach responds to the challenge posed by the presence of uncertain perturbations in the plant , measurements and interconnections .",
    "typically , a perfect consensus between sensors - agents is not possible due to perturbations . to address this challenge",
    ", we employ the approach based on optimization of the transient relative @xmath0 consensus performance metric , originally proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we approach the robust consensus - based estimation problem from the dissipativity viewpoint , using vector storage functions and vector supply rates  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to establish both mean - square robust convergence and robust convergence with probability 1 of the distributed filters under consideration and guarantee a prespecified level of @xmath0 mean - square disagreement between node estimates in the presence of perturbations and random topology changes .",
    "the information structure constraint , where the filters must rely on the local knowledge of the network topology , poses the main challenge in the derivation of the above - mentioned results .",
    "the standard framework of markov jump systems is not directly applicable to the problem of designing locally constrained filters whose information about the network status is non - markovian . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we adopt the approach recently proposed for decentralized control of jump parameter systems  @xcite .",
    "it involves a two - step design procedure .",
    "first , an auxiliary distributed estimation problem is solved under simplifying assumption that the complete markovian network topology is instantaneously available at each node .",
    "however , we seek a solution to this problem using a network of _ non - fragile _ estimators subject to uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "resilience of the auxiliary estimator to uncertain perturbations is the key property to allow this auxiliary uncertain estimator network to be modified , at the second step , into an estimator network which satisfies the information structure constraint and retains robust performance of the auxiliary design .",
    "an important question in connection with our distributed observer architecture is concerned with requirements on the communication topology under which the consensus of node observers is achievable . for networks of one- or two - dimensional agents , and networks consisting of identical agents , conditions for consensus",
    "are tightly related to properties of the graph laplacian matrix  @xcite . in a more general situation involving nonidentical node observers , the role of the interconnection graph",
    "is often hidden behind the design conditions , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "our second contribution is to show that for the distributed estimation problem under consideration to have a solution , the standard requirement for the graph laplacian to have a simple zero eigenvalue must be complemented by detectability properties of certain matrix pairs formed by parameters of the observers and interconnections .",
