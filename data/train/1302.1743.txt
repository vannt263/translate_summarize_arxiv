    "dichroism is a well known concept in classical optics where it denotes the property shown by certain materials of having absorption coefficients which depend on the state of polarization of the incident light @xcite .",
    "this concept has been further extended to the case of atomic or molecular interactions with a radiation field .",
    "in particular , the notion of circular dichroism in angular distribution ( cdad ) refers to the difference between the differential cross sections ( dcs ) of laser assisted signals for _ left _ ( @xmath0 ) and _ right _",
    "( @xmath1 ) circularly polarized ( @xmath2 ) light @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of the photon state of polarization , _ i.e. _ of its helicity , in laser - assisted high energy electron - hydrogen scattering .",
    "we show under what conditions cdad is observable at high scattering energies as a result of _ target dressing _ by the laser field .",
    "we consider optical frequencies and moderate field intensities and apply a hybrid calculational approach @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the projectile and the field is treated exactly , while the interaction between the atom and the field is treated in perturbation theory .",
    "first order born approximation is used to evaluate the scattering amplitude .",
    "we demonstrate that cdad is encountered , provided i ) the electromagnetic field is a superposition of two laser beams , one of which is linearly polarized ( @xmath3 ) and the other is a @xmath2 field , ii ) second order dressing of the target by the electromagnetic field is included .",
    "in addition , iii ) the role of the virtual transitions to the continuum is shown to be essential for the observation of cdad .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that for a special configuration not only cdad but also cd for the integrated cross sections can be observed .",
    "atomic units are used .",
    "we consider electron - hydrogen scattering in the presence of an electromagnetic field that is a superposition of two laser beams .",
    "one beam is @xmath3 , with polarization vector @xmath4 , while the other is @xmath2 with polarization vector @xmath5 .",
    "the beams can have different directions of propagation .",
    "for simplicity , we discuss the case where the two beams have the same frequency @xmath6 and intensity @xmath7 . in dipole approximation",
    "the resulting field is @xmath8 where the intensity @xmath9 .",
    "we want to know whether the dcs are sensitive to the helicity of the @xmath2 photons , defined by @xmath10 which explicitly depends on the direction @xmath11 of propagation of the @xmath12 beam . as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for high energies of the projectiles cdad does not occur for a @xmath2 laser field _",

    "we therefore present the theory for the above superposition of fields .    according to @xcite , at moderate laser field intensities",

    "indeed , both polarization terms multiplying @xmath66 would be zero since @xmath79 .",

    "next we study the angular dependence of @xmath101 .",
    "two cases are of major interest :    @xmath102 if @xmath103 , then the superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath104 is equivalent to elliptic polarization ( @xmath105 ) and we write @xmath106 .",

    "\\label{cd}\\ ] ] taking in addition @xmath117 , then the term proportional to @xmath118 gets @xmath113-independent and its contribution survives in the azimuthally integrated cross sections .",
    "thus , the choice of a privileged direction in the problem , namely that of @xmath119 , introduces an additional asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the signature of the photon helicity prevails not only in the angular distribution but also in the integrated cross sections . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first case of a laser - assisted process in which cd in the integrated cross sections is encountered .",
    "finally , we stress the importance of the form of our @xmath120-matrix element ( [ abs ] ) , since a more general structure @xmath121 was also found in discussions of dichroism in other processes , like two - photon ionization @xcite-@xcite , two - photon detachement of h@xmath122 @xcite or elastic x - ray scattering by ground state atoms @xcite .",
    "of course , the meaning of the vectors @xmath123 is specific to each process . in all these cases dichroism",
    "is caused by interferences between the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude and two terms with different angular behavior are needed to get such interferences . in the examples above , @xmath124 and @xmath45 were complex quantities . our conditions , @xmath125 or @xmath90 ,",
    "serve the same purpose .",
    "contrary to our problem , in photoionization or photodetachment of unpolarized systems there is no equivalent for our privileged direction @xmath126 and hence only cdad is observable .",
    "we present numerical results for cdad and cd in laser - assisted electron - hydrogen scattering at high energies .",
    "we analyze the dcs for @xmath127 since here the cdad effects are large enough . using the above formalism",
    ", we evaluated the dcs ( [ sed ] ) in the azimuthal plane as a function of @xmath128 for a fixed scattering angle @xmath129 and for the initial scattering energy @xmath130 ev .",
    "our laser frequency was @xmath131 ev , taken close to an atomic resonance in order to enhance the cd effects , and we chose the moderate field intensity @xmath132 w@xmath133 .",
    "the initial electron momentum @xmath134 was taken parallel to the @xmath3 vector @xmath135 , both pointing along the @xmath136axis and the @xmath3 beam propagated in the @xmath137-plane .    in case",
    "@xmath102 the @xmath2 beam propagated in the @xmath138direction and the corresponding @xmath2 vector @xmath139 has helicity @xmath140 known as @xmath141 while @xmath142 has opposite helicity @xmath143 , representing @xmath92 .",
    "in this configuration we have @xmath144 .    in figure 1(a ) we present for @xmath80 with @xmath145 the @xmath146dependence of the dcs at @xmath129 .",
    "the data for @xmath91 are shown by a dotted line and for @xmath92 by a dashed line .",
    "clearly , the laser - assisted signals depend on the helicity of the photon . in figure 1(b ) we present the results for cdad ( [ edad ] ) . since here @xmath147 , the  @xmath148  and  @xmath149  in the two lobes indicate this dependence . if @xmath150 gets integrated over @xmath113 , the net cd effect is zero .",
    "similar results and conclusions are obtained for @xmath151 .    for case @xmath114 the @xmath2 beam propagated in the @xmath152direction and the @xmath2 vector",
    "is @xmath153 so that now @xmath154 the @xmath3 beam propagated as before .",
    "figure 2 shows the dcs ( [ sed ] ) and the cdad ( [ cd ] ) for @xmath80 in panel ( a ) and for @xmath151 in panel ( b ) .",
    "dotted lines are for @xmath91 and dashed ones for @xmath92 .",
    "full lines are used for @xmath101 ( [ cd ] ) where explicitly @xmath155 due to this angular dependence , the integration of  @xmath101 over @xmath128 does not vanish .",
    "since the final momentum @xmath156 depends on @xmath45 , the shape of the azimuthal dependence of @xmath101 is different for absorption and emission .",
    "our data show that the maximum value of dichroism can amount up to @xmath157 of the assisted signal .",
    "this is comparable to or even larger than the effect predicted for x - ray scattering @xcite or for two - photon ionization @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of x - ray scattering , the dichroism in our case is increasing with increasing laser frequency .",
    "in free - free transitions at high scattering energy the dichroic effects stem from target dressing , which is increasing with the photon frequency .",
    "target dressing is significant for rather small scattering angles .",
    "we therefore expect that dichroism is large in this angular domain , and not near @xmath158 as for x - ray scattering and two - photon ionization .",
    "summarizing , we considered scattering of high energy electrons by hydrogen atoms in the presence of a laser field of moderate power but higher frequencies .",
    "the field had two components of equal frequency and intensity .",
    "one of the components was circularly , the other linearly polarized .",
    "the two laser beams were permitted to propagate in different directions . in the first order",
    "born approximation we showed that in the above scattering configuration cdad becomes observable in two - photon transitions if laser - dressing of the atomic target is carried out in second order tdpt and transitions between atomic bound and continuum states are energetically allowed , requiring higher laser frequencies . since the scattering probabilities decrease with increasing @xmath6 , we prefered to choose @xmath159 close to an atomic resonance to enhence the signals .",
    "thanks to the above laser configuration and second order target dressing , the @xmath120-matrix elements become complex as a prerequisite for predicting cdad  in the born approximation , since the elastic born - amplitude is real .",
    "we conclude that at high projectile energies cdad in free - free transitions is a second order field - assisted effect occurring under special conditions only .",
    "in particular , the matrix elements of the process considered have to be complex .",
    "similar effects might occur , if higher order terms of the born series are taken into account , since we know that then the scattering matrix elements become complex .",
    "finally , we stress the role of the two asymmetries which were introduced into the scattering configuration in order to obtain helicity dependent nonlinear signals .",
    "one asymmetry came in by the @xmath3 laser .",
    "this was sufficient to achieve cdad .",
    "a second asymmetry was determined by the momentum @xmath134 of the ingoing electrons .",
    "the two asymmetries together , more precisely @xmath160 , then led to cd that even persists if the dcs are integrated over @xmath113 . in photoionization and photodetachement there is no equivalent to @xmath161 . hence ,",
    "in those processes only cdad is encountered .",
    "the analysis of the structure of the two photon transition matrix element led us to a general formula for cdad and to our undestanding of the physical reasons of the configuration necessary to obtain cdad and cd , respectively .",
    "1 : refers to case @xmath102 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath162 .",
    "we present for @xmath80 the dcs as function of the angle @xmath113 at the scattering angle @xmath129 .",
