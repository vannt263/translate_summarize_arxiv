    "the homogeneous  isotropic standard model of cosmology , being itself a particular solution of einstein s general theory of relativity , does by far not exploit the degrees of freedom inherent in the geometry as a dynamical variable .",
    "it is this richer tone of general relativity  as compared to the newtonian theory  that opens the possibility to generalize cosmological models , notably by including inhomogeneous structure also in the geometrical variables .",
    "there are several guidelines to be emphasized in such a generalization : firstly , a cosmology is thought of as an evolving space section that implies the need to speak of a foliated space time , introducing four degrees of freedom ( the lapse and shift functions in an adm setting ) .",
    "this necessarily implies , on general grounds , a breaking of four  dimensional covariance .",
    "this fact should not be confused with coordinate or gauge  dependence of the resulting cosmological equations and variables , however .",
    "secondly , a cosmology purports an effective point of view in the sense that the evolving spatially inhomogeneous variables are thought of as being `` averaged over '' in a way that has to be specified .",
    "we aim at a description that only implicitly refers to a metric .",
    "however , if a metric is to be specified , a cosmological metric is then to be considered as an effective , `` smoothed out '' or _ template metric _ , being not necessarily a solution of the equations of general relativity . finally , a _",
    "cosmology should be characterized by such an effective evolution model , an effective metric to provide the distance scale for the interpretation of observations , or alternatively an evolution model for average characteristics on the light cone , together with a set of initial data .",
    "these latter are to be related to physical properties of fundamental sources , but also to the geometrical data at some initial time ( effective , i.e `` averaged '' quantities of known energy sources , intrinsic and extrinsic curvature ) .",
    "this latter clearly emphasizes the absence of any phenomenological parameters .",
    "those would just parametrize our physical ignorance .",
    "all these points will be made explicit in what follows .",
    "the high level of idealization of the geometrical properties of space in the standard model leads to the need of postulating sources that would generate `` on average ''",
    "a strictly , i.e. globally and locally , homogeneous geometry .",
    "it is here where a considerable price has to be paid for a model geometry that obviously is not enough to meet physical reality , unless we really believe that we can find the missing sources : @xmath0 percent of the energy content is missing in the form of a ) a postulated source acting attractive like matter , so ",
    "called dark matter ( @xmath1 percent ) and b ) a postulated source acting repulsive , so  called dark energy ( @xmath2 percent ) .",
    "evidence for the former does indeed come from various scales ( galaxy halos , clusters and cosmological , see e.g. @xcite ) , while evidence for the latter only comes from the apparent magnitude of distant supernovae ( see @xcite for the latest data ) that , if interpreted within standard model distances , would need an accelerating model . in the simplest case",
    "this volume acceration is achieved by a homogeneous ",
    "isotropic cosmology with a cosmological constant .",
    "it should be emphasized that when we speak of evidence , we already approach this evidence with model priors @xcite . keeping this idealization for the geometry of the cosmological model for example",
    ", one has to conjecture fundamental fields in proportion to the missing dark components on cosmological scales .",
    "the search for these fields is one major research direction in modern cosmology .",
    "another huge effort is directed towards a generalization of the underlying theory of gravitation .",
    "while this would generalize the geometry of the model , it is not clear why all these efforts go into a generalization of general relativity and not into the generalization of the cosmological model within general relativity .",
    "there are certainly good lines of arguments and various motivations in particle physics and quantum gravity to go beyond the theory of einstein ( for reviews see @xcite , @xcite ) , but the `` dark problem '' may be first a classical one .    looking at generalizations of the standard model _ within",
    "_ general relativity can be identified as a third research direction to which we dedicate our attention here . in light of current efforts",
    "it is to be considered conservative , since it does not postulate new fundamental fields and it does not abandon a well  tested theory of gravitation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( for reviews on the physical basis of this third approach see @xcite and @xcite ) . among the works in this latter field ,",
    "research that analyzes spherically symmetric exact solutions has been meanwhile developed to some depth , and has determined the constraints , necessary to explain dark energy , on a postulated observer s position within a large  scale void ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps a reason for not questioning the standard model geometry within general relativity and to go for the search for fundamental fields or for generalizations of the laws of gravitation is the following belief : effectively , i.e. `` on average '' , the model geometry has to be _ homogeneous _ , since structures should be `` averaged over '' .",
    "then , due to observational facts on large scales ( the high degree of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background , if the dipole is completely eliminated due to our proper motion with respect to an idealized exactly isotropic light sphere ) , and first principle priors ( the _ strong cosmological principle _ that requires the universe model to look the same in all directions ) , the model geometry is taken to be _ locally isotropic_.    taking this reasoning at face value we must note two points : the notions of homogeneity and isotropy in the standard model are both too strong to be realistic : firstly , local isotropy implies a model that is locally and globally homogeneous , i.e. despite the conjecture that the homogeneous model describes the inhomogeneous universe `` on average '' , this _ strict homogeneity _ does not account for the fact that any averaging procedure , in one way or another , would introduce a _ scale  dependence _ of the averaged ( homogeneous ) variables @xcite .",
    "this scale  dependence , inherent in any physical averages , is suppressed .",
    "even if a large _ scale of homogeneity _ exists ( we may call this _ weak homogeneity principle _ ) , the model is in general scale ",
    "dependent on scales below this homogeneity scale @xcite .",
    "the same is true for isotropy : while the averaged model may be highly isotropic on large scales , a realistic distribution on smaller scales is certainly not ( we may call this _ weak isotropy principle _ ) .",
    "correspondingly , a _ weak cosmological principle _ would be enough to cover the reality needs while still facing observational evidence on large scales .",
    "we may summarize the above thoughts by noting that , on large scales , a homogeneous(almost)isotropic _ state _ does not necessarily correspond to a homogeneous(almost)isotropic _ solution _ of einstein s equations .",
    "these former states are the averages over fluctuating fields and it is only to be expected that the state coincides with a strictly homogeneous solution in the case of absence of fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "looking at fluctuations first requires to establish the average distribution .",
    "only then the notion of a _ background _ makes physical sense @xcite .",
    "current cosmological structure formation models , perturbation theories or n  body simulations , are constructed such that the average vanishes on the background of a homogeneous  isotropic _ solution _ @xcite .",
    "a such chosen reference background may be a _ fictitious background _",
    ", since it arises by construction rather than derivation . on the contrary , a _ physical background _ is one that corresponds to the average ( whose technical implementation has to be specified , and which is nontrivial if tensorial quantities like the geometry have to be `` averaged '' ) .",
    "a sound implementation of a physical background will be a statistical background where not only solutions but ensembles of solutions are averaged .",
    "having specified such an averaging procedure , a physical cosmological model may then be defined as an evolution model for the average distribution . despite these remarks",
    "it is of course possible that the homogeneous solution forms at the same time the average .",
    "a well  known example is newtonian cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that the homogeneous solution provides , in some spatial and temporal regimes , a good approximation for the average .",
    "still , it is important to consider perturbations on the correct background solution @xcite .",
    "taking the point of view of generalizing the cosmological model within general relativity by abandoning the strong cosmological principle ( strict homogeneity and isotropy on all scales ) and replacing it by the weak cosmological principle ( existence of a homogeneity scale and restriction to effective states that are almost isotropic on the scale of homogeneity ) leads us to a `` rewriting of the rules '' to build the cosmological model .",
    "we shall consider the rules that led to the standard model of cosmology and replace them by their more general counterparts .",
    "it follows a basically similar framework that displays , however , a signature of inhomogeneity through the occurence of so  called backreaction terms and through a manifest scale  dependency .",
    "we shall not introduce new principles or assumptions , apart from the above outlined relaxation of the cosmological principle .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the simplest case of an irrotational dust model ( for generalizations of the dust model @xcite with non  constant lapse function see @xcite , and for additionally non  vanishing shift see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath3 as in the standard model we introduce a foliation of space time into flow",
    " orthogonal hypersurfaces .",
    "we generalize the notion of _ fundamental observers _ to those that are in free fall also in the general space time .",
    "although , as in the standard model , this setup depends on the chosen foliation , we presume that this choice is unique as it prefers the fundamental observers against observers that may be accelerated with respect to the hypersurfaces . a general inhomogeneous hypersurface ",
    "contrary to the homogeneous case  will , in this setting , unavoidably run into singularities in the course of evolution .",
    "this is to be expected in a given range of spatial and temporal scales , since we are treating the matter model as _",
    "dust_. this is not a problem of the chosen foliation , but a problem of the matter model that has to be generalized , if small  scale structure formation has to remain regular , and this can be achieved by the inclusion of velocity dispersion and vorticity .",
    "@xmath3 as in the standard model we confine ourselves to scalar quantities .",
    "we replace , however , the homogeneous quantities by their spatial averages , e.g. the homogeneous density @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath5 for the inhomogeneous density @xmath6 that is volume  averaged over some compact domain @xmath7 .",
    "we realize the averaging operation by a mass  preserving riemannian volume average . in some mathematical disciplines and in statistical averages at one instant of time , it may be more convenient to introduce a volume  preserving averager , but thinking of an averaging domain that is as large as the homogeneity scale we have to preserve mass rather than volume . furthermore , the average is performed with respect to the above  defined _ fundamental observers_. spatially averaging a scalar @xmath8 , as a function of gaussian coordinates @xmath9 and a synchronizing time @xmath10 , is defined as : @xmath11 with the riemannian volume element @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the volume of an arbitrary compact domain , @xmath14 .",
    "note that within a more general setup that includes lapse and shift functions , we would have to consider the question whether the locally lapsed time is replaced by a global `` averaged time '' that would involve an average over the lapse function .",
    "here , the dust cosmology is already synchronous , so that this question does not arise .",
    "note furthermore , that the building of averages is done in the inhomogeneous geometry .",
    "the averages functionally depend on the inhomogeneous metric , but this latter needs not to be specified .",
    "we may talk of a kinematical averaging that does not deform the geometry , i.e. that does not change the physical properties of the inhomogeneous space time .",
    "for other strategies , see @xcite , and references therein , as well as section  iv .",
    "@xmath3 we generalize the kinematical laws of the standard model a ) for the volume expansion ( the hamiltonian constraint in the adm formulation of general relativity ) and b ) for the volume acceleration ( raychaudhuri s equation in the adm formulation of general relativity ) by dropping the symmetry assumption of local isotropy .",
    "the general equations are then volume  averaged , leading to the following general volume expansion and volume acceleration laws ( for a volume scale factor , defined by @xmath15 ; the overdot denotes partial time ",
    "derivative , which is the covariant time ",
    "derivative here ) @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the domain dependent hubble rate @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the embedding of the hypersurfaces into the space time , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the cosmological constant .",
    "the _ kinematical backreaction _ @xmath22 is composed of averaged extrinsic curvature invariants , while @xmath23 is an averaged intrinsic curvature invariant that describes the deviation of the average of the full ( three  dimensional ) ricci scalar curvature @xmath24 from a constant  curvature model , @xmath25 the kinematical backreaction @xmath22 can also be expressed in terms of kinematical invariants , where the extrinsic curvature is interpreted actively in terms of ( minus ) the expansion tensor : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the local expansion rate and @xmath28 is the squared rate of shear .",
    "note that @xmath17 is now defined as @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath22 appears as a competition term between the averaged variance of the local expansion rates , @xmath30 , and the averaged square of the shear scalar @xmath31 on the domain under consideration .    for a homogeneous domain the above backreaction terms @xmath32 and @xmath23 ,",
    "being covariantly defined and gauge invariants in a perturbation theory on a homogeneous background solution , are zero .",
    "they encode the departure from homogeneity in a coordinate  independent way @xcite .    the integrability conditions connecting the two eqs .",
    "( [ averagedequations ] ) , assuring that the expansion law is the integral of the acceleration law , read : @xmath33 while the mass conservation law for the dust is sufficient in the homogeneous case , there is a further equation connecting averaged intrinsic and extrinsic curvature invariants in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "the expressions in brackets are conformal invariants ( for further details see @xcite .    the interpretation of these average equations as _ generalized or evolving backgrounds _",
    "@xcite , @xcite implies that the second conservation law describes an interaction between structure formation and background curvature . in the standard model",
    "this latter is absent and structures evolve independently of the background .",
    "this constant  curvature background furnishes the only solution of ( [ eq : integrability ] ) , in which structure formation decouples from the background ( the expressions in brackets in the second conservation law are separately constant ) .",
    "backreaction on such a fixed background decays in proportion to the square of the density and is unimportant in the late universe @xcite .",
    "this degenerate case of a decoupled evolution explains the fact that in newtonian and quasi  newtonian models backreaction has no or little relevance @xcite ; in the newtonian case @xcite , as well as in newtonian @xcite and spatially flat , relativistic spherically symmetric dust solutions @xcite , @xmath32 vanishes . in models with homogeneous geometry and with periodic boundary conditions imposed on the inhomogeneities on some scale ,",
    "the backreaction term is globally zero and describes cosmic variance of the kinematical properties .",
    "note here that , in general , a physical background `` talks '' with the fluctuations , and it is this coupling that gives rise to an instability of the constant  curvature backgrounds as we discuss below .",
    "the essential effect of backreaction models is not a large magnitude of @xmath22 , but a dynamical coupling of a nonvanishing @xmath22 to the averaged scalar curvature deviation @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that the temporal behavior of the averaged curvature deviates from the behavior of a constant  curvature model . in concrete studies , as discussed further below , this turns out to be the major effect of backreaction , since it does not only change the kinematical properties of the cosmological model , but also the interpretation of observational data as we explain in section  iv .",
    "we rewrite the above set of spatially averaged equations together with their integrability conditions by appealing to the kinematical equations of the standard model , which will now be sourced by an effective perfect fluid energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xcite : @xmath34 where the effective densities are defined as @xmath35 in this form the effective equations suggest themselves to interpret the extra fluctuating sources in terms of a scalar field @xcite , which refer to the inhomogeneities in geometrical variables .",
    "thus , we choose to consider the averaged model as a ( scale  dependent ) `` standard model '' with matter source evolving in a _ mean field _ of backreaction terms .",
    "this scalar field we call the _ morphon field _ , since it captures the morphological ( integral  geometrical @xcite ) signature of structure .",
    "( note that in more general cases , involving lapse and shift functions , the structure of the scalar field theory suggested by the equations may no longer be a minimally coupled one . )",
    "we rewrite @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 for a standard scalar field ( with positive kinetic energy ) , and @xmath38 for a phantom scalar field ( with negative kinetic energy ; if @xmath39 is negative , a `` ghost '' can formally arise on the level of an effective scalar field , although the underlying theory does not contain one ; note also that there is no violation of energy conditions , since we have only dust matter ) .",
    "thus , from the above equations , we obtain the following correspondence : @xmath40 the correspondence ( [ correspondence1 ] ) recasts the integrability conditions ( [ eq : integrability ] ) into a ( scale  dependent ) klein  gordon equation for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 : @xmath43 we appreciate that the deviation of the averaged scalar curvature from a constant  curvature model is directly proportional to the potential energy density of the scalar field . averaged universe models obeying this set of equations follow , thus , a friedmannian kinematics with a fundamental matter source , and an effective scalar field source that reflects the shape of spatial hypersurfaces and the shape of their embedding into spacetime .",
    "given the potential in terms of variables of the averaged system , the evolution of these models is fixed ( the governing equations are closed ) .",
    "this also potentially fixes coupling parameters , since all involved fields can be traced back to the initial value problem of general relativity .",
    "the morphon formulation of the backreaction problem opens a nice interpretation in terms of energies : a homogeneous model , @xmath44 ( a necessary and sufficient condition to also drop the scale  dependence , if required on every scale ) , is characterized by the _ virial equilibrium condition _ : @xmath45 deviations from homogeneity , @xmath46 , thus invoke a non  equilibrium dynamics of the morphon in its potential that is dictated by the effective intrinsic curvature of the space in which the fluctuations evolve .",
    "morphon energies are redistributed and can be assigned to the _",
    "dark energies_. dependent on the signs of the backreaction terms ( and a sign change may occur by looking at different spatial scales ) the morphon can act as a scalar field model for _ dark matter _",
    ", a quintessence model for _ dark energy _ , or it can even play the role of a _ classical inflaton _ , as we exemplify in the following subsection .",
    "( for the different interpretations of scalar fields see the review @xcite , and for unified views the selection of papers @xcite , and for scalar dark matter e.g. @xcite .",
    "consider a tube of space time characterized by a gravitational field with no fundamental sources .",
    "the @xmath47ricci curvature tensor vanishes everywhere , but not necessarily the @xmath47weyl curvature tensor .",
    "even if this classical vacuum space time is initially foliated into @xmath48ricci flat hypersurfaces , this does not remain so in the dynamical evolution :",
    "such an initially prepared homogeneous state is unstable ( a fact that we shall explain in the next section ) , and these hypersurfaces , if perturbed , will necessarily develop into inhomogeneous hypersurfaces featuring non  vanishing averaged curvature invariants , i.e. an intrinsic , on average negative curvature , and a compensating extrinsic curvature due to the embedding of the hypersurfaces into the ricci ",
    "flat space time .",
    "thus , in this picture , the space section will develop a morphonic scalar field that is driven by a klein ",
    "gordon dynamics and specified by the initial value of its self  interaction potential . while this instability is dynamical , the picture reminds us of the behavior of a fundamental inflaton , where the instability is created by an externally added potential .",
    "we specify initial data according to the analogy of the backreaction variables to the morphon field ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 interestingly , for a homogeneous initial state , @xmath51 , the kinetic energy density of the morphon field is initially non  vanishing , and the klein  gordon dynamics drives the morphon into a stable fix point , an ( assumed ) existing minimum of the potential .",
    "however , the outcome does not depend much on the initial data for @xmath32 : we could also start with inhomogeneous initial data , e.g. a cosmological constant that is mimicked by a particular morphon , in which case the initial kinetic energy density is zero .",
    "curvature energy is thus converted into kinetic energy , driving the system into an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "the value of the potential is necessarily always positive , since the vacuum @xmath48space has negative intrinsic curvature .",
    "the inflationary mechanism is thus the same as the mechanism to create an accelerated expansion in a quintessence phase .",
    "we realize the inflationary scenario @xcite by closing the set of averaged equations with a potential of the generic ginzburg ",
    "landau form : @xmath52 the position of the minimum @xmath53 and the amplitude @xmath54 play different roles : the first one fixes the duration of inflation , while the second sets the size of the hubble radius at which it happens .",
    "this potential has been extensively studied in the context of chaotic inflation @xcite .",
    "the various initial conditions together with their interpretation in terms of geometrical properties of space are shown in figure  [ fig : glpotential ] .    combining this purely morphonic picture of inflation created from the einstein vacuum with a fundamental scalar field",

    "; of particular interest are two instability sectors for the standard model , regarded as averaged state : firstly , perturbed homogeneous states are driven into a sector of highly isotropic , negative curvature and accelerated expanding `` backgrounds '' where backreaction thus mimics dark energy behavior over the domain @xmath7 ; secondly , perturbed homogeneous states are driven into a sector of highly anisotropic , positive curvature , collapsing and decelerated `` backgrounds '' where backreaction thus mimics dark matter behavior over the domain @xmath7 .",
    "concrete models show that the former happens on large scales , and the latter on the scales of galaxy surveys , and also on smaller scales .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the instability sectors identified comply with the aim to trace the dark components back to physical properties , but they also agree with the expected properties of the structure : isotropic , accelerating states on large scales , and highly anisotropic structures on the filamentary distribution of superclusters . moreover , the curvature properties also meet the expectations : on large scales the universe is void  dominated and , hence , dominated by negative curvature , while on intermediate scales over  densities are abundant and are characterized by positive curvature .      the fact that the standard model is globally unstable in the phase space of averaged states , and the fact that the instability sectors lie in the right corners to explain dark energy and dark matter behavior , are both strong qualitative arguments to expect that the conservative explanation of the dark energies through morphon energies is valuable .",
    "the underlying mechanism is indeed based on the fundamental existence of the relation between geometrical curvatures and sources dictated by einstein s equations .",
    "whether this mechanism is sufficient in a quantitative sense is to date still an open issue .",
    "the difficulty to construct quantitative models is to be seen in the need for non  standard tools , for example perturbation theory on a fixed reference background should be replaced by a fluctuation theory on evolving backgrounds that captures the average over the fluctuations .",
    "the question whether perturbations are small can only be answered if we know with respect to which background they are small .",
    "furthermore , since backreaction affects the geometry , it will change the interpretation of observational data , a problem that is intimately related to the generalization of the cosmological model , and to which we shall come below .",
    "before , we shall in the next section explain the identified mechanism by discussing some physical properties of structure formation and its relation to the interpretation of geometrical curvature invariants and how they mimic the dark sources .",
    "we here touch on a deeper problem : backreaction effects account for both , dark energy and dark matter , simultaneously .",
    "whether , on a given domain , or on an ensemble of domains on a given scale , the morphon mimics dark energy or dark matter behavior , changes as a function of time and as a function of scale .",
    "moreover , the small  scale contribution to e.g. a dark matter behavior requires more sophisticated relativistic models than the dust model used throughout here ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . considering rotation curves of galaxy halos , missing gravitational sources in clusters or missing",
    "sources on cosmological scales always needs different modeling strategies .",
    "we try in the following to provide a first step of disentangeling dark energy and dark matter behavior by explicitly constructing an effective multiscale cosmological model .",
    "contrary to the standard model , where a homogeneous background is used as a standard of reference for the expansion history of the universe , a background constructed as the average over fluctuating fields introduces a subtle element : while a homogeneous geometry can be characterized locally , an average is nonlocal , since it is determined by the inhomogeneities inside , but also outside the averaging domain , reflecting the nonlocal nature of gravitation .",
    "furthermore , an average incorporates correlations of the local fields .",
    "it is this latter which is the key  driver of a repulsiv `` effective pressure '' that arises in the averaged models .",
    "this `` effective pressure '' provides the reason why backreaction can produce a volume  accelerating component despite the decelerating nature of the general local acceleration law .",
    "this can be seen easily by comparing the local and the volume ",
    "averaged raychaudhuri equation ( for vanishing vorticity and pressure that both would also act accelerating on the local level , but only on small scales ) : @xmath79 where we defined the principal scalar invariants of the expansion tensor @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , by shrinking the domain to a point , both equations agree .",
    "however , evaluating the local and averaged invariants , @xmath83 gives rise to two additional , positive  definite fluctuation terms , where that for the averaged expansion variance enters with a positive sign .",
    "thus , the time  derivative of a ( on some spatial domain @xmath7 ) averaged expansion may be positive despite the fact that the time  derivative of the expansion _ at all points _ in @xmath7 is negative .    in concrete models this variance is the source of a possible large  scale volume  acceleration that would be assigned to dark energy in the standard model , while the averaged shear fluctuations mimic an attractive source that would be missing as dark matter in the standard model on cosmological scales .",
    "both terms are competing in the kinematical backreaction @xmath32 .",
    "since backreaction depends on scale , it may act in both ways .",
    "we can go one step further and make the scale  dependence explicit by introducing a union of disjoint over  dense regions @xmath75 and a union of disjoint under ",
    "dense regions @xmath76 , which both make up the total ( homogeneity  scale ) region @xmath7 .",
    "the averaged equations can be split accordingly yielding for the kinematical backreaction @xcite , @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the volume  fraction of the over  dense regions compared to the volume of the region @xmath7 . in a gaussian random field",
    "this fraction would be @xmath86 and would gradually drop in a typical structure formation scenario that clumps matter into small volumes and that features voids that gradually dominate the volume in the course of structure formation .     and @xmath87 in terms of the global scale factor @xmath88 . for comparison a line with a simple @xmath89scaling",
    "is added , that corresponds to the leading mode in second ",
    "order perturbation theory , and one that is constant .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath87 are normalized by @xmath90 so that the values at the initial time represent @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we appreciate that the backreaction terms feature an approximate cosmological constant behavior on the homogeneity scale despite the assumption of @xmath93scaling on the partitioned domains @xmath94 .",
    "physically , this result can be attributed to the expansion variance between the subdomains and , hence , this latter is identified as the key effect to produce a global dark energy  like behavior of the backreaction terms .",
    "figure from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : multiscale],scaledwidth=75.0% ]    ignoring for simplicity the individual backreaction terms on the partitioned domains , the total backreaction features a positive  definite term that describes the variance between the different expansion histories of over and under  dense regions .",
    "it is this term that generates a dark energy behavior over the domain @xmath7 ( see also @xcite for a model by rsnen , and @xcite for wiltshire s model that is based on this term only , but includes a phenomenlogical lapse function to account for different histories in @xmath75 and @xmath76 regions that , this latter , we can not implement in the synchronous foliation of a multiscale dust model ) .",
    "if we model non  zero individual backreaction terms by an extrapolation of the leading perturbative mode in second ",
    "order perturbation theory @xcite that also corresponds to the leading order in a newtonian non  perturbative model @xcite , then we even produce a cosmological constant behavior over @xmath7 , see figure  [ fig : multiscale ] . in other words ,",
    "the fact that , physically , over  dense regions tend to be gravitationally bound , i.e. do not partake significantly in the global expansion , already produces a large  scale `` kinematical pressure '' as a source of volume acceleration .",
    "a homogeneous background simply can not account for this difference .",
    "consider a spatial metric form @xmath95 with coefficients @xmath96 in an exact ( co  tangential ) basis @xmath97 .",
    "we can write any metric as a quadratic form of deformation one  forms , @xmath98 , i.e. in terms of coefficients , @xmath99 .",
    "now , such a metric form is _ homogeneous _ , i.e. its ricci tensor vanishes everywhere , if there exist functions @xmath100 , such that the one  forms can be written as exact forms , @xmath101 . in other words , if we can find a coordinate transformation @xmath102 that transforms the euclidean metric coefficients in a new basis , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , with a vertical slash denoting partial spatial derivative , into the metric coefficients @xmath96 , then these latter are just a rewriting of the homogeneous space .",
    "given this remark , any perturbation theory that features metric forms of the integrable form , does not describe relativistic inhomogeneities ; metric coefficients of the form @xmath105 describe newtonian ( lagrangian ) perturbations on a flat background space .",
    "a truely relativistic perturbation theory deforms the background geometry , in other words , the perturbations live in a perturbed space , not on a reference background .",
    "this remark also shows that relativistic perturbation terms can never contain full divergences , since this latter needs integrable one  form fields .    in light of these introductory remarks , an inhomogeneous relativistic",
    "metric produces curvature that , if volume  averaged on some domain , does not obey a conservation law ( as can be explicitly seen in the coupling equation to the fluctuations ( [ eq : integrability ] ) ) in the sense that it would always average out to zero ; for details on curvature estimates see @xcite ) .",
    "this fact in itself shows the existence of a dynamical evolution of an averaged curvature , as soon as structures form . on the contrary , standard perturbation theory formulated on a fixed flat background",
    "is constructed such that the averages always vanish on the background , demonstrating the limited nature of results obtained by standard perturbative arguments .",
    "another perturbative argument aims to justify the validity of the homogeneous geometry , even down to the scales of neutron stars @xcite , since perturbations of the metric remain small with respect to the flat background",
    ". this argument does not contradict the existence of a large backreaction effect , since these latter depend on first and second derivatives of the metric @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , the perturbations are considered on a flat background that does not interact with structure . as we explained in detail",
    ", the perturbations may be small on a different ( physical ) background , in which case a perturbation may already live in a background with strong curvature ( a zero  order effect ) .",
    "it is therefore not fruitful to argue against the relevance of backreaction within standard limited schemes , but rather an effort to generalize perturbation theory is needed .      for the construction of an effective cosmological evolution model ,",
    "as outlined above , a metric needs not be specified .",
    "the need for the construction of an effective metric in these models arises , since measured redshifts have to be interpreted in terms of distances along the light cone .",
    "given an explicit , generic and realistic , inhomogeneous metric , the need for the construction of effective metrics does not arise .",
    "also , if we succeed to understand the evolution of light cone averages in relation to distances , then also here an explicit metric will not be needed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea of an effective cosmological metric comes from the `` fitting problem '' , that has been particularly emphasized by george ellis already in the 70 s @xcite .",
    "the observation was that an inhomogeneous metric does not average out to a homogeneous metric that forms a solution of general relativity .",
    "not only the nonlinearity of the theory , but also simple arguments of a non  commutativity @xcite between evolution equations and the averaging operation , give rise to the need to find a `` best  fit '' , we may call it `` template '' geometry , that inherits homogeneity and ( almost)isotropy on the large scales and , at the same time , incorporates the inhomogeneous structure `` on average '' ( see also the early practical implementations of this problem @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    for the solution of the _ fitting problem _",
    "various strategies have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one strategy , that allows to explicitly perform a `` smoothing '' of an inhomogeneous metric into a constant  curvature metric at one instant of time , is based on ricci  flow theory : one notices that a smoothing operation of metrical properties can be put into practice by a _ rescaling _ of the metric in the direction of its ricci curvature .",
    "the scaling equations for realizing this are well  studied , and the rescaling flow results in a constant  curvature metric that carries `` dressed '' cosmological variables @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these incorporate intrinsic curvature backreaction terms describing the difference to the `` bare '' cosmological parameters as they are obtained through kinematical averaging .",
    "the standard method of interpreting observations is to construct the light cone @xmath106 from the line ",
    "element @xmath107 , where the coefficients @xmath108 are given in the form of a constant  curvature ( flrw ) metric , and then to calculate the luminosity distance @xmath109 in this metric for a given observed redshift @xmath110 . assuming this metric for the inhomogeneous universe implies the conjecture that the flrw metric is the correct `` template '' of an effective cosmological metric .",
    "however , the integrated exact equations ( the integral properties of a general inhomogeneous model ) are not compatible with this metric , simply because the averaged curvature is assumed to be of the form @xmath111 on all scales .",
    "improving the metric template slightly , by replacing the global scale factor @xmath112 through the volume ",
    "scale factor @xmath113 and the integration constant @xmath114 through the domain  dependent integration constant @xmath115 , renders this metric implicitly scale ",
    "dependent @xcite . as we explained , this is not enough since the averaged curvature couples to the inhomogeneities and in general deviates from the @xmath116behavior .",
    "what we can do as a first approximation , and this would render the metric compatible with the kinematical average properties , is to introduce the exact averaged curvature in place of the constant curvature in this metric form @xcite .    the resulting effective space time metric consists of a synchronous foliation of constant  curvature metrics that are , however , parametrized by the exact integral properties of the inhomogeneous curvature , thus they `` repair '' the standard template metric as for the evolution properties of spatial variables .",
    "such a construction can be motivated by ricci ",
    "flow smoothing , that guarantees the existence of smoothed  out constant curvature sections at one instant of time , and by assuming that the intrinsic backreaction terms are subdominant , so that we can parametrize the metric by `` bare '' kinematical averages . to stack these hypersurfaces together",
    "introduces , however , an inhomogeneous light cone structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ideally , one would wish to smooth the light cone too , which is also possible by employing ricci flow techniques .",
    "improving this first approach to a template metric is needed and this is work in progress .",
    "the result of employing the improved template metric described above is a change in the luminosity distance that would alter the interpretation of all observational data formerly based on flrw distances .",
    "examples for the multiscale models investigated in @xcite are presented in figure  [ fig : distance ] .",

    "<S> the influence of inhomogeneities on the effective evolution history of the universe is encoded in backreaction terms and expressed through spatially averaged geometrical invariants . </S>",
    "<S> these are absent and interpreted as missing dark fundamental sources in the standard model . in the inhomogeneous case they can be interpreted as energies of an emerging scalar field ( the morphon ) . </S>",
    "<S> these averaged invariants vanish for a homogeneous geometry , where the morphon is in an unstable equilibrium state . if this state is perturbed , the morphon can act as a classical inflaton in the early universe and its de  balanced energies can mimic the dark sources in the late universe , depending on spatial scale as dark energy or as dark matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we lay down a line of arguments that is qualitatively conclusive , and we outline open problems of quantitative nature , related to the interpretation of observations . </S>"
