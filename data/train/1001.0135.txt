    "_ stellar stratification _ is a characteristic phenomenon of star clusters , which has been well documented for more than 50 years .",
    "it is directly linked to the dynamical evolution of star clusters @xcite , and specifically to the central concentration of the massive stars as the cluster relaxes dynamically , a phenomenon known as _ mass segregation _ ( for detailed reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this behavior in massive galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) is well understood and the observed mass segregation is explained as a result of their dynamical relaxation in a timescale , @xmath1 , much longer than their ages , @xmath2 , as derived from stellar evolutionary models . this _ dynamical _ mass segregation , thus , forces more massive stars to sink inwards to the center of a cluster through weak two - body interactions .",
    "however , segregation of massive stars is observed also in young star clusters , such as the @xmath3  30  myr - old cluster ngc  330 in the small magellanic cloud @xcite , or even the @xmath3  1  myr - old galactic starburst ngc  3603 @xcite .",
    "such systems , supposedly not sufficiently old to be dynamically relaxed , can not be included in the `` traditional '' picture of dynamical mass segregation as it occurs in ggcs .",
    "for these cases the phenomenon has been  rather tentatively  characterized as _ primordial _ mass segregation , based on the suggestion that this stellar stratification is due to the formation of the stars in , or near , the central part of the clusters rather than being dynamically driven    mass segregation at early stages of clustered star formation is indeed predicted by theoretical studies , which suggest that the positions of massive stars for rich young clusters of @xmath4 can not be the result of dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , the appearance of gas in such clusters reduces further the efficiency of any dynamically driven mass segregation . according to theory ,",
    "massive protostars can be formed _ at the central part _ of the protocluster through cohesive collisions and dissipative merging of cloudlets , which lead to extensive mass segregation and energy equipartition among them @xcite , or through accretion from a distributed gaseous component in the cluster , which leads to mass segregation since stars located near the gravitational center of the cluster benefit from the attraction of the full potential and accrete at higher rates than other stars @xcite .",
    "both of the aforementioned massive star formation mechanisms predict primordial mass segregation through early dynamical processes at the central part of the protocluster .",
    "the significant difference of these processes from the subsequent energy equipartition of the stars in the formed cluster is that the latter , and consequently dynamical mass segregation , is independent of the initial cluster conditions , while the former , and therefore primordial mass segregation , is directly connected to these conditions . in order to achieve a complete understanding of the phenomenon of primordial mass segregation ,",
    "many related studies are focused on clusters at very early stages of their formation , including a variety of types of stellar systems from loose stellar associations and open clusters to compact massive starbursts .    the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , being extremely rich in young star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , offer an outstanding sample of intermediate type of stellar systems , specifically compact young star clusters , which are not available in the galaxy . in such clusters",
    "primordial mass segregation can be sufficiently observed from ground - based observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they are also suitable for more detailed studies of this phenomenon from space with the high - resolving efficiency of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such studies contribute significantly to the debate about the phenomenon of primordial mass segregation and its origin which which is still ongoing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that while the existence of the phenomenon itself is being questioned @xcite , new methods are still being designed for its comprehensive identification and quantification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the first part of our study of stellar stratification we developed and tested a new robust diagnostic method aimed at establishing the presence ( or not ) of this phenomenon in a cluster ( * ?",
    "* from here on paper  i ) .",
    "this method is based on the calculation of the mean - square radius , the so - called _ effective radius _ , of the stars in a cluster for different magnitude ranges , and the investigation of the dependence of the effective radii of each stellar species on magnitude as indication of stellar stratification in the cluster .    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      stellar",
    "stratification affects the presently observable physical properties of the star cluster , and thus diagnostic tools for the identification of the phenomenon are based on the detection of mass- or brightness - dependent changes of such properties .",
    "previously established methods involve ( i ) the study of the projected stellar density distribution of stars of different magnitudes ; here , the differences in the exponents of the slopes fitted are seen as proof of mass segregation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) the radial dependence of the luminosity or mass function ( lf , mf ) slope ; a gradient of this slope outwards from the center of the cluster indicates stratification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( iii ) the variance of the core radius of the cluster as estimated for stars in specific magnitude ( or mass ) groups ; a trend of this variance with brightness ( or mass ) signifies stratification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while these methods can provide useful information about the segregation in a cluster , all of them are sensitive to model assumptions , since they strongly depend on data fitting for parametrizing stellar stratification ; i.e. , functional expressions for the surface density profiles , or the mfs and lfs are required for the derivation of their slopes and core radii .",
    "our method , developed in paper  i for assessment of stellar stratification in star clusters , is based on the notion of the dynamically stable _ spitzer radius _ of a star cluster , defined as the mean - square distance of the stars from the center of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observable counterpart of this radius , the effective radius , is given by the expression : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projected radial distance of the @xmath7th stellar member of the cluster in a specific brightness range and @xmath8 the corresponding total number of stars in the same brightness range .",
    "different calculations of the effective radius are performed , each for stars in different brightness ranges that cover the whole observed stellar luminosity function of the cluster .",
    "the simple application of this method can yield direct information about the spatial extent ( radial distribution ) of stellar groups in different magnitude ( mass ) ranges . in a star cluster , where stratification occurs",
    ", the segregated brighter stars are expected to be more centrally concentrated and the corresponding effective radius should be shorter than that of the non - segregated fainter stars . as a consequence , stellar stratification can be observed from the dependence of the effective radius of stars in specific magnitude ( mass ) ranges on the corresponding mean magnitude ( mass ) .",
    "this method is sufficiently described and tested in paper  i , where we show that it performs efficiently in the detection of stellar stratification , provided that the incompleteness of the photometry has been accurately measured and the contamination by the field population has been thoroughly removed .",
    "our diagnosis method is also independent of any model or theoretical prediction , in contrast to those used thus far for the detection of mass segregation .",

    "a small dither was made between the two exposures of a given target , to help facilitate the removal of cosmic rays and hot pixels ; however with only two images per cluster it was not possible to eliminate the gap in spatial coverage due to the inter - chip separation .",
    "the data products produced by the standard stsci reduction pipeline , which we retrieved from the public archive , have had bias and dark - current frames subtracted and are divided by a flat - field image . in addition , known hot - pixels and other defects are masked , and the photometric keywords in the image headers are calculated .",

    "we used the dolphot photometry software ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "dolphot performs point - spread function ( psf ) fitting using psfs especially tailored to the acs camera . before performing the photometry",
    ", we first prepared the images using the dolphot packages acsmask and splitgroups . respectively , these two packages apply the image defect mask and then split the multi - image stsci fits files into a single fits file per chip .",
    "we then used the main dolphot routine to simultaneously make photometric measurements on the pre - processed images , relative to the coordinate system of the drizzled f814w image .",
    "we chose to fit the sky locally around each detected source ( important due to the crowded nature of the targets ) , and keep only objects with a signal greater than @xmath18 times the standard deviation of the background .",
    "the output photometry from dolphot is on the calibrated vegamag scale of @xcite , and corrected for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) degradation .    to obtain a clean list of stellar detections with high quality photometry",
    ", we applied a filter employing the sharpness and `` crowding '' parameters calculated by dolphot .",
    "the sharpness is a measure of the broadness of a detected object relative to the psf  for a perfectly - fit star this parameter is zero , while it is negative for an object which is too sharp ( perhaps a cosmic - ray ) and positive for an object which is too broad ( e.g. , a background galaxy ) .",

    "[ f : phterr ] typical uncertainties in the derived magnitudes of the stars detected in all three clusters are shown for both f555w and f814w filters .        in order to assign a detection completeness fraction to each star , we used dolphot to perform a large number of artificial star tests . for each star in our final cleaned catalogue",
    "we first generated a list of @xmath23 associated fake stars using the dolphot utility acsfakelist .",
    "we constrained these fake stars to lie close to the real star on the ( f555w , f814w ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )  the fake stars were randomly and uniformly distributed in a box of size @xmath24 centered on the real star , where @xmath25 was the maximum of @xmath26 mag and @xmath27 times the uncertainty in the @xmath28 magnitude of the real star , and @xmath29 was the maximum of @xmath26 mag and @xmath27 times the uncertainty in the ( @xmath30 ) color of the real star .",
    "we were also careful to constrain the spatial positions of the fake stars .",
    "often this is done so that the fake stars lie at similar cluster - centric radii to the real star under consideration , but with unconstrained position angle .",
    "this saves on computation time because the calculations are then valid for groups of real stars at a time , rather than simply on an individual basis .",
    "however , because we are dealing with very young clusters in the present work , this implicit assumption of spherical symmetry is not necessarily valid .",
    "these objects could potentially still be embedded in gas or dust and thus exhibit a strongly varying background .",
    "they are also not very dynamically evolved , so may yet possess azimuthal asymmetries in stellar density as well as numerous randomly placed bright stars .",
    "therefore , we adopted the more computationally expensive method of generating the list of fake stars locally around each real star on the ccd  in this case randomly and uniformly within a radius of @xmath31 . in doing this",
    "we were careful to account for the edges of the chips , including the inter - chip gap .",
    "we then ran dolphot in artificial stars mode on each list of fake stars .",
    "when operating in this way dolphot takes the next fake star from the list , adds it to the input images , and then solves for the position and photometric properties of the star using exactly the same parameters as for the original ( real star ) analysis .",
    "once complete , we took the output photometry and ran it through our quality filters , just as we did for the list of real stars .",
    "finally , we calculated the completeness fraction for a given real star by determining how many of its associated fake stars had been successfully ` found ' .",

    "however , the appearance in this spatially constrained cmd of a prominent rgb population , clearly suggests that the cluster may comprise a mixture of different stellar populations .",
    "as we discuss earlier and seen from the cmds of figure  [ f : totcmds ] , all three observed regions suffer from significant contamination by field stars . with no information about cluster - membership probabilities for the observed stars , obtained , e.g. , from radial velocities and/or proper motions ,",
    "the quantitative decontamination of the clusters from the field stars on a statistical basis becomes a fundamental method to obtain the cmd of the complete sample of true stellar members of each cluster .",
    "we decontaminate , thus , the observed cmds from the contribution of the stellar members of the surrounding local field of the lmc with the use of a sophisticated random - subtraction technique .",
    "this field - subtraction algorithm , originally designed by @xcite , is already developed in paper  i , where it is also thoroughly described . according to this technique , the successful decontamination of the clusters from the field is based on the definition of the limiting radius , @xmath66 , for each cluster . for the clusters in our sample , @xmath66 is given by the tidal radii , @xmath47 , estimated in   [ ss : bestfitking ] with the use of king s theory .",
    "all stars located at distances @xmath96 from the center of the cluster are treated as field stars , while the rest ( with @xmath97 ) are considered as the most probable cluster - member stars . assuming a homogeneous field - star distribution , the number density of field stars is calculated in the field cmd ( figure  [ f : totcmds ] ; middle ) constructed for stars with @xmath96 , considering also the observational uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "the decontamination process is then applied in three steps for each cluster : ( i ) division of the cmds of the stars with @xmath98 ( cluster region ) and of those with @xmath99 ( offset region ) , respectively , in 2d cells with the same axes along the m@xmath100 and ( m@xmath101m@xmath100 ) directions .",

    "( iii ) random subtraction of the expected number of field stars from each cell from the cmd of the cluster region .",
    "the algorithm is applied several times using different cell sizes ( @xmath102m@xmath100 , @xmath102(m@xmath101m@xmath100 ) ) so that many different decontamination results are derived . from these results",
    "we calculate the final probability that a star is identified as a ` true ' cluster member , and the final decontaminated cmd of the cluster contains only the stars with the highest probability of being cluster members .",
    "this process allows us to minimize any artificial effects intrinsic to the method itself .",
    "a detailed description of the mathematical formulation of our method for field - subtraction is given in paper i.          we performed the field - subtraction process , as described above , 15 times for each cluster considering combinations for the cmd cell sizes of @xmath102m@xmath103  0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.5 and 3.0  mag and @xmath104m@xmath101m@xmath105  1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0  mag .",
    "we obtained , thus , the probability for each star in each sample of being a member of cluster population . since our method for diagnosis of stellar stratification is completeness - sensitive in the subsequent analysis we limit the sample of stellar members of all three clusters to those detected with our photometry with completeness @xmath106  70% .",
    "the derived stellar samples comprise 424 stars in ngc  1983 , 1  102 stars in ngc  2002 and 2  265 stars in ngc  2010 with probability larger than 70% of being true cluster members .",

    "stars found by the field - subtraction method with probability 100% of being cluster members are plotted with thick points . from these cmds",
    "it can be seen that our statistical subtraction of the cmd contamination by the field stars was efficient in removing both young field populations of the immediate surroundings of the clusters , _ and _ old populations of the general lmc field . specifically , for ngc  1983 the ms stars remaining in the cmd of figure  [ f : syscmds ] , after the application of the field - subtraction , form a sharp narrow ms down to @xmath107  mag .",
    "this ms resembles that of the cmd within the @xmath46 of the cluster shown in figure  [ f : totcmds ] ( bottom ) , with no indication of the broad lower ms stars of the field cmd of figure  [ f : totcmds ] ( middle ) .",

    "the rsgs located within the @xmath46 of the cluster also remained in the cmd of figure  [ f : syscmds ] with 100% of membership probability .",
    "as far as ngc  2010 is concerned , the statistical field subtraction removed completely the bright ms young stars identified in   [ ss : cmds ] as young field stars , while the older ms and evolved stars remained with high probabilities of being true cluster members .",
    "it should be noted that the lower main sequence of the cmds of the clusters may be also sensitive to any potential pre - main sequence ( pms ) population that might exist in such young clusters .",
    "however , due to observational constrains , we would be able to detect only the turn - on of these pms stars , which is known to coincide with the msto ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , very close to our detection limit .",
    "as a consequence , any pms population in the clusters would be seriously affected by the incompleteness in our photometry and therefore does not have any significance in the measured stellar numbers .",
    "another bias that may affect the final numbers of low main sequence cluster - members is differential reddening that could displace stars to the red - faint part of the cmd . however , differential reddening in young lmc clusters is known to account for no more than @xmath108 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is well covered by the color uncertainties in our photometry at the low main sequence .",
    "as a consequence , differential reddening is not considered in our treatment for field subtraction .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the cluster cmds of figure  [ f : syscmds ] for both ngc  2002 and ngc  2010 show the same features with the corresponding @xmath46 cmds of the clusters ( figure  [ f : totcmds ] , bottom ) , that of ngc  1983 shows clear indications of multiple young populations with @xmath109  15  mag . indeed , as we discuss in ",
    "[ ss : cmds ] , multiplicity is a typical characteristic of young lmc clusters , and naturally it may lead to a merging process and mixing of different stellar populations within one cluster ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as we can not verify or reject this scenario for ngc  1983 , we treat all 424 stars that meet our membership criteria as true members of the cluster .",
    "our diagnostic method for stellar stratification is applied in the following section on the final catalogs of stellar members of the clusters , with 70% membership , the cmds of which are shown in figure  [ f : syscmds ] .",

    "i the comparison of the results of this method with those from the ` classical ' methods of the radial dependence of the clusters lfs and mfs , showed that the _ effective radius _",
    "method behaves more efficiently in the detection of the phenomenon , providing direct proof of stellar stratification in star clusters without considering any model or theoretical prediction , and with no application of any functional fit . in this section",
    "we apply this method for the detection and quantification of stellar stratification to the young lmc clusters of our sample .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.5% ]      we calculated the effective radii , @xmath110 , of the stars in different magnitude ranges , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : reff ] ) , using the completeness corrected numbers of stars for all three clusters .",
    "we performed this calculation only for the star - members of the clusters , as they are established in ",
    "[ ss : clusmem ] ( cmds of figure  [ f : syscmds ] ) , and we used their brightness measured in the f814w filter , since this filter provided the most complete and accurate photometry ( see   [ ss : phot ] ) . in order to identify any functional relation between @xmath110 and the corresponding brightness range , we binned the stars according to their magnitudes .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath110 depends strongly to the number of stars per bin , this process naturally inherits systematic uncertainties to the derived relations , because of the fact that some stars could belong to neighboring bins due to photometric uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we performed the same binning process per cluster several times by changing the bin sizes and/or the magnitude limits , within which the stars are binned .",
    "we found that a reasonable bin size , which provides good statistics and allows for the detailed observation of the dependence of @xmath110 on magnitude , is that of 0.5  -2.truept  @xmath111  -2.truept  1.0  mag .",
    "for this range of bin sizes we did not find any significant change in the general trend of @xmath112 , which is also found to be independent of the selected magnitude limits for binning the stars .    in figure",
    "[ f : reffmag ] we indicatively show the relations between the computed effective radii and the corresponding magnitude bins derived from two different binning processes with bin sizes of 1  mag and magnitude ranges shifted by 0.5  mag from each other .",
    "the combination of both distributions with these specific binning characteristics ( each plotted with different symbols ) provides measurements of @xmath110 for every 0.5  mag range .",
    "the derived trends of @xmath112 , shown in these plots , are not different from the corresponding distributions derived for @xmath113  mag , except of being somewhat smoother . in general the relations of figure",
    "[ f : reffmag ] are representative of those found from any applied binning , and therefore we consider them in the following section for the derivation of our results concerning stellar stratification in the clusters .",
    "the @xmath112 graphs of figure  [ f : reffmag ] are plotted on the same scale for reasons of comparison between the clusters . in these plots",
    "it is shown that the effective radius does behave as a function of magnitude , but not necessarily providing proof of stellar stratification for all clusters .",
    "a definite indication of stellar stratification would require the effective radii of the faintest stars to be systematically larger than those of the brightest ones for the whole observed brightness range .",
    "this is not the behavior we observe at least for two of the three clusters of our sample . indeed , as we discuss in paper  i , @xmath110 is not a monotonic function of brightness , and mass segregation , _ if any _",
    ", is not expected to behave in the same manner in every cluster , but rather to depend on the intrinsic stellar characteristics of each of them .",
    "for example , while in ngc  2002 there is a trend of fainter stars having systematically larger effective radii for the whole luminosity range , this is not the case for ngc  1983 that shows this trend for only a limited magnitude range , and certainly not for ngc  2010 , which one may argue is not even segregated .",
    "specifically , for ngc  1983 , the brightest magnitude bins , down to @xmath114  16  mag , seem to include stars that are located away from the central part of the cluster .",
    "indeed , the brightest stars in the cluster cmd ( figure  [ f : syscmds ] ) with @xmath115  15.5  mag are found to be distributed within the largest @xmath110 of about 12 away from the center of the cluster and not closer than about 06 . on the other hand , taking into account the remaining magnitude bins of @xmath116  15.5  mag , the graph of @xmath112 for ngc  1983 provides clear indications that the cluster is segregated with an almost monotonic dependency of larger @xmath110 to fainter stars .",
    "the graph for ngc  2002 is quite different , giving evidence that the cluster is segregated in the whole extend of observed stellar luminosities .",
    "there is , however , a dependency of the appearance of a relation between @xmath110 and brightness on the considered magnitude range .",
    "indeed , while the three brightest magnitude bins , comprising six stars ( the five rsg and the brightest ms star ) , correspond to the smallest effective radii , the next fainter bins , which include six more ms stars , show that these stars are located well away from the center of the cluster . moreover , from the plot of figure  [ f : reffmag ] for the fainter stars , it is almost self - evident that they are segregated as the corresponding relation @xmath112 demonstrates an increase of @xmath110 with brightness .",
    "the behavior of this relation for ngc  2010 is quite different from both the previous cases , as there is no general trend for larger effective radii with fainter magnitudes observable , and thus the cluster behaves as if there is no significant stratification occurring .",
    "specifically , apart from the fact that the three brightest magnitude bins are inconclusive , for more faint stars there is a `` plateau '' in the function @xmath112 , which appears rather flat for magnitudes down to @xmath117  19  mag , while for even fainter stars , down to the faintest observed magnitude , the dependence of @xmath110 over @xmath118 appears again , giving evidence of mild mass segregation for the faintest stars at the outskirts of the cluster .",

    "in addition , from the characteristics of table  [ t : param ] it is shown that this cluster is the most extended and least dense in the sample . moreover",
    ", the cmd of the cluster ( figure  [ f : syscmds ] ) shows indications of multi - age stellar populations , suggesting that ngc  2010 is a cluster with multiple stellar generations . in such clusters a large fraction of the first generation of stars",
    "is lost early in the cluster evolution due to its expansion and stripping of its outer layers resulting from early mass loss associated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in general , the loose appearance of a low - density cluster with large @xmath46 , comes to the support of this speculation .",
    "while this can not be verified with the present data , it would be reasonable to suggest that the lack of stellar stratification in this cluster will make the effect of early mass loss due to stellar evolution less destructive leading to longer lifetimes @xcite .",
    "as far as ngc  2002 is concerned , it is interesting to note that this cluster , being the most segregated in the sample , is actually the youngest ( table  [ t : param ] ) and located in a region , which appears to correspond to the emptiest general lmc field of the three ( table  [ t : structpar ] ) .",
    "naturally , these observations allow us to suggest that detection of stellar stratification may have been benefitted by the loose contaminating stellar field , and that the observed stellar stratification in ngc  2002 may be _ primordial in nature _ due to the star formation process , or due to very early dynamical evolution .",
    "indeed recent studies show that cool , fractal clusters can dynamically mass segregate on timescales comparable to their crossing - times , far shorter than usually expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the exact nature , though , of the observed segregation can not be fully understood without detailed kinematic information about the cluster members , or deeper photometry that will provide the complete imf of the cluster .",
    "finally , the observed _ partial _ stellar stratification in ngc  1983 is driven by the fact that the brightest stars of the cluster are distributed in a wide range of distances from the cluster center .",
    "in general , the behavior of @xmath110 as function of stellar magnitude can not be connected to any specific difference of its characteristics from those of the other clusters , apart from the fact that the cluster belongs to the richest region in field populations , and it is a rather elliptical cluster .",
    "we present a coherent comparative investigation of stellar stratification in three young lmc clusters with the application of a robust method for the assessment of this phenomenon on deep hst imaging . in a cluster where stellar",
    "stratification occurs , the segregated brighter stars are expected to be more centrally concentrated than the non - segregated fainter stars .",
    "stellar stratification can , thus , be investigated from the dependence of the radial extent of stars in specific magnitude ( mass ) ranges on the corresponding mean magnitude ( mass ) . according to this notion , in paper  i @xcite we developed and verified the efficiency of a robust method for the assessment of stellar stratification in star clusters .",
    "this method is based on the calculation of the mean - square radius , the _ effective radius _",
    "@xmath110 , of stars in different magnitude ranges , and the investigation of its dependence on magnitude as indication of stellar stratification in the cluster .    in the present study",
    "we apply the _ effective radius method _ for the detection and quantification of stellar stratification in young star clusters in the lmc .",
    "we select three clusters observed with the high resolving efficiency of hst / acs , specifically ngc  1983 , ngc  2002 and ngc  2010 , on the basis of the differences in their appearance , structure , stellar content , and surrounding stellar field .",
    "our photometry delivered complete stellar catalogs down to @xmath147  -  23  mag for all three observed fields (   [ ss : phot ] ) .",
    "the stellar surface density maps of the observed regions , constructed from star counts on the photometric catalogs , demonstrate that all three clusters are morphologically quite different from each other .",
    "ngc  1983 appears to be a centrally concentrated , rather elliptical compact cluster , ngc  2002 a compact , spherical stellar concentration , and ngc  2010 a large , loose and rather amorphous cluster (   [ ss : contmap ] ) .",
    "the application of both eff @xcite and king s @xcite models on the stellar surface density profiles of the clusters allowed us the measurement of the background stellar field density of the regions , and the estimation of the core radii , @xmath46 , of the clusters .",
    "while these clusters do not seem to be tidally truncated , a tidal radius , @xmath47 is estimated , indicative of the limiting radius of each cluster (   [ s : dynamics ] ) .",
    "the latter is essential for the successful application of a random field subtraction technique for the decontamination of the stellar samples of the clusters from their surrounding young stellar ambient and the general lmc field (   [ ss : fldsub ] ) .",
    "we derive the ages of the clusters from the stellar populations comprised within the @xmath46 of the clusters and we find ages of @xmath89  28  myr , 18  myr and 159  myr for ngc  1983 , ngc  2002 , and ngc  2010 respectively (   [ ss : clusage ] ) .",
    "we finally apply the _ effective radius method _ for assessing stellar stratification in the clusters and for its quantitative study (   [ s : methappl ] ) .",
    "we bin the stars according to their magnitudes in the f814w filter , and we estimate the corresponding effective radii , @xmath110 , for every cluster in our sample .",
    "we then plot the derived radii versus the corresponding mean magnitude and we investigate the functional relation , @xmath112 , between these parameters . with our method",
    "it is shown that stellar stratification behaves differently in every cluster .",
    "ngc  1983 appears to be _ partially segregated _ , since its brightest stellar content does not appear to be centrally concentrated , while its fainter stars show a mild dependency of @xmath110 towards lower values for fainter magnitudes .",
    "the results on the bright stars of ngc  2010 show evidence of lack of stratification , since the brightest stars are located quite far away from its center .",
    "as far as the faint stars are concerned they show a rather flat @xmath112 relation , with no evidence of segregation in this relation for the faintest stars .",
    "consequently , this cluster is characterized as _ not segregated_. finally , ngc  2002 is found to be well segregated for both its brighter and fainter stars .",
    "it is a clear case of proof of stellar stratification with the effective radius method .",
    "we propose the _ slope _",
    "@xmath140/@xmath141 , measured for stars in selected magnitude ranges , as well as in the whole magnitude range , as the most appropriate parameter for the quantification of the _ degree of stratification _ , and we use it to characterize the phenomenon as it is observed in the clusters . from the derived values of @xmath138 (   [ ss : stratdeg ] ) we find that ngc  2002 is the most strongly segregated cluster in the sample with a degree of stratification @xmath148 , ngc  1983 is a partially segregated cluster with @xmath149 for the faintest stars with @xmath118  -2.truept  15.5  mag , and ngc  2010 is not segregated with indicative @xmath150 (   [ ss : results ] ) .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the extension of this study to a larger sample of lmc clusters observed with hst will provide a more complete picture of the phenomenon of stellar stratification .",
    "naturally , the development of such a comparative scheme , which will include star clusters in the whole extent of the evolutionary sequence , requires a comprehensive set of acs and , in the near future , wfc3 observations .",
