    "the perfect fluid cosmological models are built on the dynamics governed by einstein s theory of general relativity with the cosmological principle valid at large cosmic scales and the assumption of cosmic compositions as idealized perfect fluids , which means that all components of the matter - energy in our universe are considered as perfect fluid without any viscosity which may be interpreted as a result of having taken a roughly gross grain approximation .",
    "the well - known @xmath0cdm model , which is regarded as the most idealized standard description for current cosmology , obtains a constant dark energy term ( the famous cosmology constant ) that permeates the space everywhere and globally fits the observational data sets very well  @xcite . but researches have shown that dynamical dark energy models are also allowed by both observations and theoretical considerations  @xcite .",
    "so far the related research work in this line has produced a variety of improved models , and one direction is studying the practical effects of the physically existing viscosity on the cosmic evolutions and its manifestations  @xcite .",
    "it is a natural fact that viscosity exists in the universe evolution history with its eminent role in the thermal plasma as from hot big bang like stages and the important effect of turbulence viscosity has been observed both in intra - galactic and inter - cluster medium .",
    "even though the existence of viscosity is not a problem , we are confused by its possible origin in the cosmos and how the cosmic viscosity affects the cosmological evolution .",
    "in other words , we are pursuing after physically reasonable explanations and acceptable behaviours of the large - scale existing viscosity in the universe .",
    "much efforts have been made to study imperfect models with various forms of viscosity term  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the perfect fluid universe should be an approximation of imperfect fluid universe when it inflates , where the evolutional behaviour of viscosity should be functioning .    according to the observationally homogeneous and isotropic property of the large scale theoretical universe discussed above , we focus on the the bulk viscosity ( or the 2nd viscosity ) term , while neglecting dissipation and shear viscosity which are incompatible with the cosmological principle .",
    "the full expression of moment - energy tensor containing extra pressure of bulk viscosity reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is energy density , @xmath3 , the isotropic pressure of perfect fluid , @xmath4 , the four - velocity of the cosmic fluid in co - moving coordinates , @xmath5 represents the projection tensor , and @xmath6 .",
    "we will propose an imperfect fluid model with temperature - dependent viscosity origin in the following section .",
    "model constrainted with cosmic observational data - sets are included in the third section .",
    "we discuss and perform some numerical contrasts between the viscous model and @xmath0cdm model in section four . in the end",
    ", we briefly show some features of the new model with conclusions .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ stress tensor ] ) , the effective pressure which includes the contribution from bulk viscosity reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bulk viscosity parameter , and @xmath9 is the eos parameter of cosmic fluid except for the viscosity . for simplification ,",
    "we neglect the radiation since it contributes little to the late - stage evolution scenario .    in this article",
    "we try to extend the concept which is one possible origin of cosmic viscosity  molecular - like interaction  to cosmological researches . on large - scale",
    "we assume : + first , the interaction between galaxies or baryon clumps and other thermal interactions occurred in local area could be effectively depicted by molecular - like interaction seen on large - scale .",
    "+ second , we try to use linear - evolution law to mimic the evolutional behaviour of an universal temperature which can represent the large - scale effects of those local phenomena .",
    "+ we are quite confident that at the last scattering , such universal temperature is about @xmath10 and it must be approaching zero corresponding to the dilution of cosmic - fluid through late - stage expansion . as a test",
    ", we set the effective temperature as @xmath11 , equalling to the cmb black - body temperature at present .    in this paper , we adopt two appropriate molecular - like collision/ interaction models for cosmology study , from which the viscosity is physically generated ; one is based on the chapman - enskog equation  @xcite for dilute multicomponent gas mixtures  @xcite ( to a first approximation ) which can be simplified as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are generalized temperature - independent factors which include collision diameter , collision integral , and molecular mass .",
    "@xmath15 represents the fraction of each component .",
    "the other one is the sutherland s formula  @xcite which reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is sutherland s constant , the prime represents reference values here .",
    "the above two models are both semi - theoretical or empirical with first order approximation .",
    "the chapman - enskog equation assumes that molecules possess only translational kinetic energy , while sutherland s formula assumes molecules are smooth rigid elastic spheres surrounded by fields of attractive force .",
    "both forms are available for building cosmological models under proper simplification , since the empirically determined parameters are impossible to be given precisely on cosmic large scales . at low temperature ( @xmath18 ) , a general equation which can approximately represent the main feature of chapman s and sutherland s formulae reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is considered as a simplified coefficient , and @xmath21 equals to @xmath22 or @xmath23 , which are chosen specifically in order to physically represent chapman s or sutherland s limit formula respectively .",
    "theoretically , @xmath21 could be lower than @xmath23 in sutherland s formula ( [ suths ] ) , we pick this value as the upper limit in late - time cosmological evolution .",
    "thus , the chapman s model and sutherland s model of viscosity origin can be unified by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and extended on cosmic large scales in late - stage evolutional era .",
    "at first we tried the unified dark fluid model , which unfortunately may lead to singularity phenomenon , indicating that unified imperfect dark fluid model can hardly explain the full richness of dark energy phenomenon , this result is in consistent with previous researches  @xcite .",
    "we keep in mind that so far by the global fitting , any feasible cosmology model to include the dominated dark energy should not deviate too much away from the @xmath0cdm model , which leads us to move on to the study of effective viscosity functioning on the basis of @xmath0cdm .      in this subsection",
    ", we focus on the application of viscosity to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the expression of viscosity follows eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) which contains both the physical content of chapman s equation and sutherland s formula , while the corresponding einstein s equations which include the constant dark energy @xmath0 term in the flat frw metric read @xmath24 where @xmath25 is energy density of pressure - less matter , @xmath26 represents energy density of the constant dark energy , and @xmath27 is the light speed in the vacuum ( in natural units @xmath27 equals to one ) .",
    "the expression of the effective pressure @xmath3 which includes the viscosity contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) then reads @xmath28 where the first term is the effect of constant dark energy which eos parameter @xmath29 exactly , and the second term comes from the effect of viscosity .    the combined form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq19])([eq21 ] ) reads @xmath30 which can be parametrized as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath21 equals to @xmath22 or @xmath23 according to the specific formulae of viscosity .",
    "the power index @xmath34 in the above equation corresponds to sutherland s formula and chapman s relation respectively .",
    "we name this model @xmath0cdm - v where v is short for the viscosity . for convenience ,",
    "letter `` a '' and `` b '' are added as postfixes when @xmath21 equals to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the new model differs from the standard @xmath0cdm with an additional term @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) , which has no simply analytical solution .",
    "we will use numerical method by bayesian analysis in model constraining .",
    "notice here exist two theoretical restrictions for eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) , i.e : @xmath36 which is a natural boundary condition , and @xmath37 which must be ensured due to the physical existence of viscosity .      in this subsection",
    "we have proposed a model which explicitly announces that the universe consists of baryons , cold dark matter , constant dark energy and viscosity , and both the dark energy and viscosity contributes to the effective pressure .",
    "in addition to the observational h(z )  @xcite listed in table  ( [ tab0 ] ) and sne ia data - sets ( union 2.1 ) with and without systematic errors , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data - sets  @xcite listed in table  ( [ tab00 ] ) , which has strong constraints on dark energy models will also be included in model constraining .",

    "<S> bulk viscosity has been intrinsically existing in the observational cosmos evolution with various effects for different cosmological evolution stages endowed with complicated cosmic media . normally in the idealized  standard cosmology \" </S>",
    "<S> the physical viscosity effect is often negligent in some extent by assumptions , except for galaxies formation and evolution or the like astro - physics phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> actually we have not fully understood the physical origin and effects of cosmic viscosity , including its functions for the universe evolution in reality . in this present article </S>",
    "<S> we extend the concept of temperature - dependent viscosity from classical statistical physics to observational cosmology , especially we examine the cosmological effects with possibility of the existence for two kinds of viscosity forms , which are described by the chapman s relation and sutherland s formula respectively . by considering that a modification of standard model with viscosity named as @xmath0cdm - v model is constructed , which is supported by data fitting . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the enhancement to cosmic age value , the @xmath0cdm - v model possesses other two pleasing features : the prediction about the no - rip / singularity future and the mechanism of smooth transition from imperfect cosmological models to perfect ones . </S>"
