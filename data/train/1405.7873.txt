    "heisenberg s principle of uncertainty expresses the notion of a fundamental limitation of precise values for a pair of complementary observables for any quantum state .",
    "mathematically the uncertainty principle is often expressed as a tradeoff between the standard deviations of the relevant observables . in its most common form ,",
    "the so - called heisenberg uncertainty relation , a tradeoff is expressed between the standard deviations of the position @xmath0 and the momentum @xmath1 of a single non - relativistic particle . using @xmath2 to denote the standard deviation of @xmath0 in state @xmath3 and similarly @xmath4 to denote the standard deviation of @xmath1 , we have @xmath5 in units where @xmath6 . in the context of multislit interferometry",
    "though , it is clear already from an intuitive point of view that the relevant complementary observables are not exactly position and momentum .",
    "indeed , position should be replaced by  which slit \" information , and momentum with fringe width .",
    "the choice for a mathematical representation of the former is clear ( simply a coarse - grained position ) , but fringe width is less obvious . as is well known ",
    "see , for instance , ref .",
    " and also argued here , the standard deviation of momentum can not describe fringe width , rendering the heisenberg relation unsuitable for expressing complementarity in the interferometric context .",
    "this may seem particularly surprising considering the important role played by the uncertainty relation in the historic bohr - einstein debate , which was concerned , _",
    "inter alia _ , with the complementarity of path information and interference contrast .",
    "it is not that the standard deviation as such is a poor measure though ; it is the particular combination of standard deviation and the momentum operator @xmath1 that is problematic .",
    "a more suitable expression of the uncertainty principle may be found by using observables that take into account the periodic nature of the experimental setup .",
    "mathematically , the idea is to modify the pair @xmath7 by making @xmath0 discrete and @xmath1 periodic .",
    "when properly adjusted , the resulting pair will still have a  canonical \" nature that leads to an uncertainty relation .",
    "we are going to derive commutation relations for such operators , which are formally similar to the standard relation .",
    "the derived relations , however , will be valid only for wavefunctions of a subset specific to the interferometric setup under consideration .",
    "a proper understanding of this limited validity of the uncertainty relation requires careful consideration of the mathematical subtleties of the problem , in particular of domain questions .",
    "the adaptation of the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the interferometric context is due to aharonov _",
    "et al . _ , who also provided a heuristic argument that the uncertainty relations discussed here should exist @xcite",
    "however , their work was never developed beyond invoking an analogy to angle and angular momentum .",
    "most importantly , the fact that the relations are only valid for specific wavefunctions was never made clear .",
    "this is perhaps due to insufficient mathematical development of the problem in their work and in related publications @xcite .",
    "it was not until the work of gneiting and hornberger of 2011 that correct commutation relations were stated @xcite , but the discussion there is mainly formal and with a different focus . in conclusion",
    ", a thorough analysis seems in order .",
    "we present here , to our knowledge for the first time , a precise derivation and discussion of these uncertainty relations .",
    "furthermore , we address limitations and benefits of the uncertainty relations , and discuss an application to uniformly illuminated apertures and the asymptotic behavior of the uncertainty product in this case .",
    "we found that further conceptual development of the idea of aharonov _ et al .",
    "_ was necessary for describing the fine structure of quantum states as prepared in a given interferometry experiment .",
    "precisely resolving the fringe structure of the interference wavefunction is only possible with an observable that is adapted specifically to the particular experimental setup .",
    "we thereby obtain the expected asymptotic behavior and find that the uncertainty product converges to a finite value in the limit of infinitely many illuminated slits .",
    "the underlying argument follows from considerations involving a product form of a certain physically motivated set of interference wavefunctions .",
    "this product form , although mathematically elementary , provides interesting insight into the structure of interference wavefunctions and apparently remained unnoticed .    throughout",
    "we will emphasize the interplay between physics and mathematics leading to a derivation that is mathematically deceptively simple and physically insightful , although occasionally subtle on both accounts . from a more practical point of view",
    ", we also provide a simple way of computing the uncertainty products , based on the aforementioned product form of the wavefunctions .",
    "( otherwise rather involved integrations would be required . )",
    "the traditional approach , employing relation , fails at quantifying the uncertainty of a double - slit superposition state .",
    "assuming rectangular slits of width @xmath8 and a wavefunction @xmath9 of constant real - valued amplitude passing through an array of slits , the intensity profile of the fringe pattern with slits at locations @xmath10 is given by the fourier transform @xmath11 where the _ cosine _ describes the fringes , and the _ sinc _ describes an envelope .",
    "for an illustration , see fig .",
    "as @xmath12 diverges , relation provides no information .",
    "the presence of fringes , or lack thereof , has no impact on the result .",
    "this is particularly apparent when considering the single - slit state @xmath13 , for which again @xmath14 .",
    "the root of this problem is the combination of standard deviation and operator @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the moments of @xmath1 are insensitive to the relative phase between two path states , or even to the absence of a phase relation in the case of a mixed state .",
    "this led aharonov _",
    "_ to instead consider unitary shift operators for a description of interference , as these can be used to create overlap and thus establish sensitivity to relative phase .",
    "they then proposed a decomposition of the noncommuting operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 into commuting parts @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( periodic ) and noncommuting parts @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and presented a heuristic argument that an uncertainty relation of the same form as the heisenberg relation should exist .",

    "in fact , it is possible to obtain the following two commutators for general quantum states @xcite @xmath44}={\\mathrm{i}}\\,{\\bf 1}-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,k\\,{{\\sh}_{k}}((\\cdot)-k/2),\\label{jukka1 }      \\\\&{\\left[{q_{\\mathrm{mod}}},p_k\\right]}={\\mathrm{i}}\\,{\\bf 1}-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,t\\,{{\\sh}_{t}}.\\label{jukka2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the dirac comb @xmath45 , which we denote using the cyrillic letter ` sha ' as is occasionally done in electrical engineering . the dirac comb ( or shah function )",

    "the two relations and , are unsuitable for obtaining uncertainty relations resembling , because of the state - dependent term . simplifying these commutators to a canonical form is only possible if the wavefunction vanishes at the locations of the delta peaks  this leads to the aforementioned restriction on the validity of the associated uncertainty relations .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the two commutation relations and is rather long and technical ; it will be provided in ref .  .",
    "it proceeds by making precise the analogy with the angular momentum - angle case alluded to by aharonov _",
    "et al_. in fact , relations of the form , have been known for the angular momentum and angle pair since the 1960s @xcite .    here",
    "we present an alternative argument that immediately leads to the desired commutators by exploiting the properties of the relevant quantum states from the beginning .",
    "for the detailed discussion we focus on the pair @xmath17 and @xmath16 as it is more natural to considerations in multislit interferometry ; an analogous argument holds for @xmath18 and @xmath15 . in order to determine the commutator @xmath48}\\psi={\\left(q_t{p_{\\mathrm{mod}}}-{p_{\\mathrm{mod}}}q_t\\right)}\\psi\\ ] ] it is necessary to ensure that @xmath49 here @xmath50 denotes the domain of the indicated operator .",
    "recall that the _ domain _ of an operator is a subspace of square integrable wavefunctions ( elements of the hilbert space @xmath51 ) , which , upon application of the operator , yield wavefunctions that are still square integrable .",
    "since @xmath16 is bounded , its domain is the whole hilbert space and hence does not lead to restrictions .",
    "first , note that the domains of @xmath0 and of @xmath17 are equal , because these two operators differ by the bounded @xmath15 .",
    "second , noting that @xmath0 acts as a differentiation operator in momentum space , a wavefunction in its domain is required to be ( even absolutely ) continuous .",

    "note that if @xmath59 were not continuous , the derivative would not approach a finite limit value at the point of discontinuity ; more precisely , we could describe the point of discontinuity by a step function , whose ( distributional ) derivative is a delta function  this line of reasoning would eventually lead to the state - dependent correction terms in and .",
    "wavefunctions that naturally appear in the interferometric context typically have _ nodes _ ( i.e. zeros ) periodically . as is evident from comparing figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f0 ] and discussed in more detail below , our specific choice for @xmath16 in has its discontinuity points aligned with the nodes of the particular wavefunctions considered here .",
    "we emphasize once more that a more general wavefunction @xmath55 with periodic but non - vanishing values at the discontinuity points of @xmath16 is unsuitable because of boundary effects that lead to a state - dependent commutator .",

    "this section contains a number of conceptual and technical points and some critical observations on the work of aharonov _",

    "while the pairs of operators appearing in and are more appropriate for multislit interferometry than , it must be stressed that these inequalities are valid only for quantum states @xmath71 and @xmath70 , respectively , which vanish at the points of discontinuity of @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "notable exceptions are the eigenstates of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in particular",
    ", the uncertainty relation is inappropriate for a description of single - slit states .",
    "this point is particularly intriguing , because it is the adaptation of the observables to multislit interferometry that rules out the description of single - slit states .",
    "the heuristic argument provided by aharonov _",
    "et al . _ refers to the analogy between the pair @xmath41 and the pair of angular momentum and angle operators , the latter being understood as in the review of carruthers and nieto , ref .  .",
    "the analogy can be made precise by observing that the restriction of the weyl commutation relations to a discrete set of position variables and periodic set of momentum variables defines a representation of the weyl relations on the group @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the circle group .",
    "this representation is reducible , corresponding to the fact that the eigenspaces of @xmath17 are infinite - dimensional , and can be decomposed into a direct sum of copies of the angle - angular momentum pair .",
    "we will return to this topic in more detail in a more technical work @xcite .    finally , we feel obliged to point out that in the later publications by aharonov _",
    "@xcite , their heuristic uncertainty relation@xcite is instead presented as an actual inequality of the form @xmath74 in units where @xmath6 .",
    "this is , of course , incorrect as the claimed lower bound is easily violated .",
    "there is no indication that these authors are considering a non - standard definition of the standard deviation . on the contrary , the explicit definitions in ref .",
    "indeed confirm that standard deviations are used .",
    "furthermore , the operator used by aharonov _",
    "_ to measure the fringe width appears to lack the shift performed in .",
    "it follows that the value assigned to the fringe width increases as the number of illuminated slits is increased , indicating that the relevant features of the fringe width are not captured .",
    "in contrast , our choice yields the expected asymptotic behavior .",
    "the example application in the following section demonstrates this .",
    "for our detailed discussion we focus on the uncertainty relation , which describes the tradeoff between the spatial localisation of a quantum state incident on a multislit aperture and its fringe width .",
    "we consider states obtained as follows : a single illuminated slit is assumed to prepare a quantum state described by a rectangular function of slit width , while a general aperture yields a suitable superposition of those . as the eigenspaces of @xmath17 are excluded ",
    "analysis of single - slit states is beyond the scope of this approach  we consider superposition states of @xmath75 coherently illuminated slits , where @xmath75 is an even positive integer .",
    "these quantum states are but a subset of the quantum states that a multislit aperture can prepare , but they describe the important cases of the double slit aperture  illustrated in fig .

    "this choice is actually entirely irrelevant as will become evident shortly .",

    "while this result might be expected by way of physical considerations , we show in appendix b that it indeed follows when computing @xmath89 .",

    "this is not a coincidence ; the central idea of the formulation of uncertainty discussed here is that a direct sum of such ` boxes ' is considered .",
    "more explicitly , for the particle in a box the spatial wavefunction of the lowest energy eigenstate is described by a half cosine pulse , whereas a single fringe of the double - slit state is described by a half cosine pulse . in these two considerations position space and momentum space",
    "are reversed : a spatial wavefunction is ( typically ) considered for the particle in the box , whereas a wavefunction in momentum space is considered here .",

    "dividing each of the two halves results in quarters gives a cosine factor scaled by @xmath100 , which is the centre - to - centre distance between the quarters .",
