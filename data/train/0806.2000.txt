    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two distant parties to share secret keys that are unconditionally secure . until now , there have been several kinds of qkd protocols .",
    "the traditional bb84 protocol is one based on qubits , in which alice sends bob a sequence of qubits to establish a secret key @xcite . on the other hand , there are other non - qubit - based protocols , such as the continuous variable qkd scheme @xcite . in these two protocols ,",
    "regardless of whether qubit states or continuous states are used , each state ( or state pair ) received by bob directly gives rise to one bit value .",
    "in contrast , in differential phase shift ( dps ) qkd , information is encoded in the difference between each two adjacent quantum states inoue , inoue2,yamamoto . of the above protocols ,",
    "the last one is designed to achieve high speed communication . in ref .",
    "@xcite , diamanti , et al . have realized dpsqkd with a modulation frequency of 1 ghz .",
    "dpsqkd is well suited for coherent - state sources as information is encoded in the relative phases of coherent states .",
    "coherent - state sources can also be used with other protocols , for example , the bb84 protocol with phase - randomized coherent states  @xcite whose performance is substantially improved by the decoy - state method  @xcite , the bb84 protocol with phase - non - randomized coherent states  @xcite , and the b92 protocol with strong reference pulses  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the unconditional security of the bb84 protocol is well discussed ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the cvqkd protocols ,",
    "its security against collective attack is also well discussed @xcite .",
    "however , for dpsqkd , we only know that it is secure against several specific attacks , e.g. , the beam splitting attack and the intercept and resending attack @xcite . until now , we do not know whether it is secure against any quantum eve even in the noiseless case . on the other hand , specific attacks on dpsqkd",
    "have been proposed to evaluate upper bounds on the secret key generation rates of dpsqkd @xcite .    in this paper , we prove the security of dpsqkd against collective attacks @xcite with a weak coherent light source in the noiseless case .",
    "the security in this case follows from a key result that we will prove in this paper , namely that eve s state is independent of the positions of bob s detected signals .",
    "this result makes sense since the fact that there is no bit error restricts what eve can do to bob s signals .",
    "in particular , she has to ensure that bob receives all signals with equal intensities , since signals with different intensities will result in bit errors with non - zero probability .",
    "our final result on the lower bound on the key generation rate is a function of the estimated parameters of the channel ( see eq .   ) . in order to understand this result further ,",
    "we compute this bound by considering a channel that produces a binomial distribution in bob s detection statistics .",
    "specifically , we show that the lower bound of the secret key generation rate per pulse is linearly proportional to the channel transmission probability ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the only assumptions used in the proof are that quantum theory is correct , the key size is infinite and the devices are perfect and trusted .",
    "our proof works on threshold detectors , which are the detectors commonly used in practice .",
    "furthermore , we do not require quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements .",
    "even though we consider collective attacks in this paper , we speculate that it is possible for us to extend our security proof to the most general attack , namely the coherent attack .",
    "an intuitive justification tells us that eve can not get more information from coherent attacks than that from collective attacks as the key size goes to infinite @xcite . for the finite dimension case",
    ", there is a exponential de finetti theorem that can strictly give this result @xcite .",
    "however , for dpsqkd , the states sent by alice are weak coherent states and thus in theory the dimension of bob s received states may be infinite .",
    "thus , the current de finetti theorem can not be directly applied . on the other hand , there are three potential ways to solve this problem . since in practice",
    "the states sent by alice are weak coherent states and the probability that bob gets a large photon number is extremely small , it is possible to prove that alice and bob s states can be well approximated by states that have a finite support",
    ". then the current de finetti theorem can be applied .",
    "the second way is to extend the current exponential de finetti theorem to the infinite dimensional case .",
    "we can see a hope of this in ref .",
    "the third way is to extend the current de finetti theorem to the case with finite number of measurement results , since we know that in dpsqkd , bob s measurement results are finite .",
    "the work in ref .",
    "@xcite also shows that this way may be viable .",
    "we note that there is also a recent proof @xcite on the dps protocol .",
    "their proof assumes a single - photon source and requires qnd measurements , whereas our proof allows a more general weak coherent light source and does not require qnd measurements .",
    "on the other hand , their proof can handle the noisy case and applies to the most general attack , whereas ours can only handle noiseless collective attacks .    in the following analysis",
    ", we map the traditional dps protocol into a big - state protocol and give the security proof for this big - state protocol . in doing so , we prove a key result of our paper , which is that eve s state is independent of the positions of bob s detected signals . with this result and some properties of the mutual information ,",
    "we can upper bound eve s information about alice s bit string .",
    "finally , we evaluate the key rate assuming a typical setting in which the detection statistics follows the binomial distribution .",

    "this protocol is then equivalent to the original dpsqkd protocol @xcite . in this protocol ,",
    "bob measures the phase difference between every two adjacent pulses .",
    "thus , it may not be a good idea to try to map them into single bits and then discuss the security . here",
    ", our basic idea is to regard @xmath18 states as one big state and to discuss the security of this big state . in the following",
    ", we will introduce three protocols that map the above protocol into a big state protocol , in which alice sends bob a big state and bob measures it with @xmath18 equipments .",
    "the security of these three protocols are weaker than the above one .",
    "thus , if the security of these inferior protocols are proved , then the security of the above protocol is proved .          in step 1 , according to the binary string @xmath31 , alice generates a state @xmath32 and sends it to bob through @xmath18 fibers . in the quantum channel , there is a quantum memory ( qm ) system that separates @xmath33 into an @xmath18-state sequence and sends each state to bob one by one through one fiber ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "steps 2 - 9 remain the same .",
    "there is no difference between protocol 1 and protocol 2 at bob s side .",

    ", the qm system can be controlled by eve .",
    "however , it can be seen that if the qm system is put at alice s side and can not be controlled by eve , protocol 2 is equivalent to protocol 1 .",
    "therefore , the security of protocol 2 is weaker than that of protocol 1 .",

    "bob reads out the stored @xmath18 signals one by one through @xmath18 fibers and measures their phase differences via m - z systems which should be equivalent to the measurements in protocol 1 ( these m - z systems can be realized by the detection equipments shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that if the qm system is at bob s side and can not be controlled by eve , then protocol 3 is the same as protocol 2 .",
    "since in protocol 3 this qm system can be controlled by eve , the security of protocol 3 is no stronger than that of protocol 2 .          in step 1",
    ", alice generates a state @xmath34 and sends it to bob through @xmath18 fibers . in step 2 , while receiving this big state , bob measures the phase difference between each two adjacent states at the same time with the equipment shown in fig .",
    "steps 3 - 9 remains the same as in protocol 1 .    it can be seen that the only difference between protocol 3 and protocol 4 is that in protocol 3 bob measures each phase difference one by one , but in protocol  4 bob measures them all together . since different detectors just measure different field quadratures , the measurement operators that describe these detectors commute with each other . therefore , there is no difference between measuring the phase difference one by one and measuring them all together .",
    "thus , protocol 4 is equivalent to protocol 3 .",
    "since protocol 4 is inferior to protocol 1 , in the following we will prove the security of protocol 4 first . then the security of protocol 1 follows .",

    "we remark that we do not place any restriction on the block length @xmath18 , which can be finite . under the collective attack scenario",

    "before giving the security proof of the dps protocol , we will show the main idea of our security proof . in the dps protocol ,",

    "this system can let bob definitely know the deterministic phase difference between the two pulses with certain probability ( bob can definitely know the phase difference if he gets a count . ) .",
    "finally alice and bob only keep the measurement results of the phase differences that bob has good knowledge of .",
    "the point is that either bob knows that eve has obtained good information on a pulse pair ( in which case he has not gotten a photon count and this result is discarded ) or bob knows more about this result than eve does ( in which case alice and bob proceed to distill a secret key by applying error correction and privacy amplification to many of such result ) . in the following",
    ", we will rigorously prove this when there is no bit error .",
    "first , we prove that under the no - bit - error case eve s state is uncorrelated with the permutation of @xmath42 , which means that eve s state is independent with the position of bob s detections .",
    "then we show that eve s average information about the sifted keys is only determined by the total number of bob s detections . since the maximum total information eve gets from alice",
    "is restricted by alice s modulation , through several properties of the mutual information , we can give an upper bound to eve s information on the sifted data .",
    "then the security of the dps protocol under the no - bit - error case is proved .    here",

    "it is enough to only discuss the attack for a single communication @xcite .",
