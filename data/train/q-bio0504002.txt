    "the growing availability of genomic dna sequences enables research on profiles of gene expression , single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) and their role , molecular diagnostics for cancer etc . in turn , these activities require simultaneous interrogation of a given sample for the presence of numerous different nucleic acid sequences .",
    "dna microarrays , `` dna chips '' , emerged as an important method for such parallel analysis ( graves , 1999 ; wang , 2000 ; lockhart and winzeler , 2000 ; heller , 2002 ) .",
    "dna chips function by parallel hybridization of labelled nucleic acid sequences in the solution , known as targets , to an array of nucleic acid probes bound to a surface .",
    "numerous identical probes are localized at a small area known as `` spot '' or `` probe cell '' .",
    "the composition of the sample is deduced from the label intensities of the different spots after the hybridization .",
    "dna chips are produced in one of two main formats . in cdna microarrays ,",
    "long cdna targets are physisorbed onto the substrate while in oligonucleotide chips short oligonucleotides are chemically bound to the surface via their terminal groups .",
    "our theoretical considerations address the hybridization behavior , kinetics and thermodynamics , of oligonucleotide microarrays when the targets are much longer than the probes as is typically the case in biology experiments ( see for examples : guo et al .",

    "a growing theory effort aims to clarify the underlying physics of dna chips with view of assisting in their design and in the analysis of the results .",
    "the langmuir isotherm and the corresponding kinetic scheme provide a natural starting point for the modeling ( chan et al . , 1995 ; livshits and mirzabekov , 1996 ; vainrub and pettitt , 2002 ; bhanot et al . , 2003 ;",

    "2003 ) . within this model , the probes ,",
    "irrespective of their hybridization state , do not interact .",
    "this assumption is justified when the probe density in the spots is sufficiently low . at higher probe densities interactions are no longer negligible and the langmuir model requires modifications .",
    "as we shall discuss , the necessary modifications depend crucially on the length of the targets as characterized by @xmath6 , the number of bases or monomers .",
    "importantly , in biology experiments the targets are usually significantly longer than the probes . as a result ,",
    "each hybridized probe binds a long segment of single stranded nucleic acid formed by the unhybridized part of the target ( fig .",
    "this leads to two effects .",
    "first , when the tails do not overlap the hybridization at an impenetrable surface incurs an entropic penalty .",
    "this reduces the equilibrium constant of hybridization with repect to its bulk value .",
    "second , it is necessary to allow for the crowding of these unhybridized `` tails '' as the fraction of hybridized probes grows .",
    "this crowding gives rise to a polymer brush , a phenomenon that was extensively studied in polymer physics ( milner , 1991 ; halperin et al .",
    ", 1992 ; rhe et al . ,",
    "the theory of polyelectrolyte brushes ( pincus , 1991 ; borisov et al .",
    ", 1991 ; rhe et al . ,",
    "2004 ) , as modified to allow for target - probe interactions and wall effects , enables us to analyze the effects of the crowding on the thermodynamics and kinetics of hybridization on dna chips .",
    "in particular , we obtain the hybridization isotherm and the rate equation in the brush regime when the unhybridized tails overlap .",
    "as we shall see , the free energy penalty associated with the brush gives rise to distinctive modification of the langmuir isotherm and kinetics .",
    "importantly , the brush penalty reflects both the electrostatic interactions within the probe layer and the entropic price due to the extension of the crowded chains .",
    "it results in slower hybridization and lower attainable hybridization .",
    "our analysis focuses on oligonucleotide microarrays hybridizing with long targets of single stranded ( ss ) dna .",
    "for simplicity we limit the discussion to the experimentally attainable case of monodispersed targets and probes , a passivated surface that eliminates physical adsorption of dna and probes anchored to the surface via short spacer chains",
    ". the qualitative features of our results apply however to a wider range of systems .",
    "two hybridization regimes appear , depending on the equilibrium hybridization fraction , @xmath0 , as set by the bulk concentration of the target , @xmath10 . for low @xmath0 ,",
    "the hybridization isotherm is of the langmuir form , @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the equilibrium constant of the hybridization reaction at the surface . for probes comprising @xmath12 bases @xmath3 at an impenetrable surface",
    "is reduced by a factor of @xmath4 with respect to the equilibrium constant of the free chains in solution . at",
    "higher @xmath0 , obtained at higher @xmath10 , the effective equilibrium constant is modified because of the brush penalty .",
    "the leading correction to the hybridization isotherm is @xmath13 $ ] where @xmath14 corresponds to the onset of brush formation .",
    "the formation of the brush does not affect the denaturation rate constant of the hybridized probe .",
    "however , it does lower the hybridization rate constant by a factor of @xmath15 $ ] where @xmath16 is the instantaneous hybridization fraction . the proportionality constant scales with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the area per probe .",
    "to our knowledge , there has been no direct experimental study of the effects of brush formation on the hybridization isotherms and the hybridization rates . yet , experimental evidence of brush effects has been reported .",
    "guo et al .",
    "( 1994 ) observed that the maximum attainable hybridization fraction is reached at higher @xmath18 when @xmath6 increases .",
    "su et al . ( 2002 ) reported slower hybridization as @xmath6 increases at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "a similar effect was reported for rna targets by dai et al .",
    "further support for the existence of the brush effect is lent by the wide spread use of sample fragmentation to achieve a lower average @xmath6 ( see for example : rosenow et al . , 2001 ; affymetrix , 2004 ) .",
    "the practical implications of our analysis concern three issues : the design of dna chips , the sample preparation and the analysis of the data .",
    "the design of dna chips currently reflects the view that an increase in the oligonucleotide density in a spot should increase the signal intensity and therefore the sensitivity ( pirrung , 2002 ) .",
    "certain limitations of this strategy , due to the increase of the dna diameter upon hybridization and the resulting steric hindrance , has been long recognized ( southern et al . , 1999 ) . in marked distinction",
    ", our analysis highlights limitations due to the crowding of the long non - hybridized tails of the targets .",
    "thus , in choosing @xmath18 it is useful to bear in mind the anticipated @xmath6 of the sample and its effect on the attainable hybridization .",
    "when @xmath18 is fixed , our analysis provides guidelines for the sample preparation .",
    "in particular , the choice of @xmath6 as determined by the pcr primers or the fragmentation procedure . concerning data analysis , our discussion identifies possible sources of error when comparing spot intensities of samples with different @xmath6 .",
    "these may occur because both the onset of saturation and the hybridization rate vary with @xmath6 .",
    "in quantitative terms , our analysis yields two guidelines : concerning equilibrium hybridization , it leads to a simple relationship between the area per probe , @xmath18 , the number of bases in the probe , @xmath5 , the number of bases in the target , @xmath6 , and the attainable sensitivity as measured by",
    "@xmath19 i.e. , the target concentration resulting in @xmath20 hybridization at the spot . regarding the kinetics , it yields a simple criterion for the onset of slowdown due to the brush formation .",
    "experiments using dna chips involve many control parameters concerning the chip design , the sample preparation and the hybridization conditions .",
    "these are outlined in design of oligonucleotide microarray experiments together with a discussion of the resulting hybridization regimes and the choice of parameters used in our numerical calculations .",
    "our analysis incorporates ingredients from the theory of polymer brushes .",
    "these are summarized in background on polymer brushes .",
    "this section describes the flory version of the alexander model of brushes as applied to terminally anchored polyelectrolytes in aquaous solution of high ionic strength .",
    "the model is modified to incorporate the effect of an impenetrable grafting surface .",
    "this is important in order to ensure crossover to the mushroom regime , of non - overlapping tails , and to enable comparison of the hybridization constants at the surface and in the bulk .",
    "since the hybridization site is typically situated within the target , each hybridized probe carries two unhybridized tails .",
    "the necessary modifications are also discussed .",
    "when brush formation is possible , the hybridized targets also interact with neighboring probes .",
    "the resulting free energy penalty , within the flory approximation , is described in target - probe interactions .",
    "the free energies associated with the brush and with the target - probe interactions enable us to obtain the equilibrium hybridization isotherms .",
    "the derivation is discussed in brush effects  thermodynamics of hybridization .",
    "the hybridization isotherms allow to quantify the sensitivity in terms of the corresponding @xmath19 . in turn , these yield design guidelines relating the sensitivity to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath18 . assuming , and later checking , that the hybridization rate at the surface is reaction controlled enables us to specify the hybridization and denaturation rate constants in the different regimes .",
    "the necessary background , on the hybridization kinetics in the bulk and the desorption dynamics out of a brush , as well as the resulting rate equations are discussed in brush effects  kinetics of hybridization .",
    "the second virial coefficient , @xmath21 , specifying the interactions between the charged monomers of polyelectrolytes in the high salt regime is discussed in appendix a. using this @xmath21 , we recover our earlier results of the @xmath22 case and discuss the comparison to the @xmath23 scenario . in appendix",
    "b we present an alternative derivation of our result for the hybridization contant in the low surface density regime .",
    "this utilizes exact results thus avoiding the approximations inherent to the `` alexander - flory '' approximation .",
    "oligonucleotide chip experiments vary widely in their design .",
    "a brief summary of the possible designs is necessary in order to delineate the range of applicability of our analysis and the different possible regimes . to this end",
    "it is helpful to distinguish between three groups of design parameters : the chip design , the sample characteristics and the hybridization conditions .",
    "the primary parameters in the chip design ( pirrung , 2002 ) are the area per probe , @xmath18 , and the number of bases in the probe , @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 values in the range @xmath24 to @xmath25 are typical . in this context",
    "one should discriminate two approaches to the production of oligonucleotide chips .",
    "in one , the probes are synthesized in situ using photolithography . in the other , pre - synthesized oligonucleotides with functionalized end groups",
    "are delivered to the spot . in the first approach it is necessary to allow for the production of incomplete sequences leading to polydispersity in @xmath5 ( forman et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the reported probe densities within spots vary between @xmath26 and @xmath27 probes per @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath29 .",
    "the chip characteristics also include the nature of the surface treatment used to minimize non - specific adsorption and of the spacer chains joining the probe to the anchoring functionality ( length , charge , hydrophobicity , etc . ) .",
    "a key qualitative characteristic of the sample is the chemical nature of the targets ( graves , 1999 ; lockhart and winzeler , 2000 ; heller , 2002 ) . to begin , it is necessary to distinguish between dna and rna targets which differ in two respects : first , single stranded ( ss ) rna exhibits pronounced secondary structure ( loops , hairpins , etc . ) which is largely absent in ssdna .",
    "second , the hybridization free energy of rna - dna complexes is higher than that of dna - dna ones . for dna samples , it is further necessary to distinguish between samples of double stranded ( ds ) dna , as obtained from symmetric pcr amplification , and ssdna samples as obtained , for example , using lambda exonuclease digestion .",
    "the hybridization isotherms of the two types of samples are different ( halperin et al . , 2004a ) .",
    "the labelling of the targets can also affect the hybridization behavior ( naef and magnasco , 2003 ) .",
    "our discussion concerns samples of ssdna targets assuming ideal labels that do not interfere with the hybridization .",
    "it focuses on the role of two quantitative characteristics of the sample : the number of bases in the target , @xmath6 , and the molar concentration of the target , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath6 is determined by the choice of primers used for the pcr amplification or by the fragmentation step in the sample preparation .",
    "note that the products of the pcr are monodisperse while the fragmentation introduces polydispersity in the size of the targets . in this last case",
    "it is only possible to control the average size of the targets .",
    "typical reported values for pcr products vary in the range @xmath30 .",
    "the average @xmath6 resulting from the fragmentation procedure is not always specified but the range @xmath31 is representative .",
    "it is useful to note another distinction between the two procedures .",
    "targets produced by pcr often have the hybridization site situated roughly in the middle of the target . in the case of fragmented targets , the location of the hybridization site is no longer controlled . with regard to @xmath10",
    "it is helpful to stress the distinction between bioanalytic experiments , utilizing dna chips to interrogate biological samples ( see for example : prix et al . , 2003 ) , and physical chemistry experiments aiming to understand the function of dna chips ( see for example : peterson et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "in biology experiments @xmath10 is a priori unknown since it is set by the biological sample and its treatment . in marked contrast , in physical chemistry experiments the target concentration is imposed by the experimentalist as is the composition of the sample . in such experiments",
    "the target used is often identical in length to the probes , @xmath22 .",
    "as noted earlier , our analysis is motivated by bioanalytical experiments where @xmath23 .",
    "the hybridization conditions include the composition of the hybridization solution , the hybridization temperature , @xmath32 , and the hybridization time , @xmath33 .",
    "typical hybridization temperatures vary over the range @xmath34 depending on @xmath5 and the gc fraction .",
    "the hybridization times also vary widely with typical values in the range of @xmath35 . in most cases",
    "the hybridization solution contains @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "different hybridization regimes are possible , depending on the values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath18 . to distinguish these regimes , it is necessary to first specify the molecular length scales of ssdna and dsdna .",
    "these are well established for dsdna ( cantor and schimmel , 1980 ) . in the range of parameters considered ,",
    "dsdna is a rod - like molecule with each base pair contributing @xmath38 to its length .",
    "the radius of dsdna is @xmath39 and its cross section area is @xmath40 . we will limit our analysis to @xmath41 in order to avoid discussion of steric hindrance to hybridization .",
    "the corresponding characteristics of ssdna are not well established .",
    "a typical value of the monomer size is @xmath42 ( smith et al . , 1996 ; strick et al . , 2003 )",
    "the cited values of the persistence length , @xmath43 , vary between @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( mills et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "ssdna is often described as a random coil though long range interactions are expected to give rise to swollen configurations ( turner , 2000 ) . in the following",
    "we will consider ssdna as a swollen coil characterized by its flory radius ( rubinstein and colby , 2003 ) .",
    "this choice is dictated by our treatment of the brush , where the flory radius emerges as a natural length scale .",
    "accordingly , an isolated unhybridized probe occupies a hemisphere of radius @xmath46 while a terminally hybridized target occupies a hemisphere of radius @xmath47 .",
    "as we shall discuss , the unhybridized probes do not interact when @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath49 there is no brush regime .",
    "it is thus possible to distinguish between three different scenarios .",
    "a langmuir regime is expected when @xmath50 .",
    "brush effects , with no interactions between the probes , will occur when @xmath51 . finally , when @xmath52 both the brush effect and probe - probe interactions play a role .",
    "all three scenarios occur in the reported variety of dna chips .    in the following we consider the role of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath18 in bioanalytical experiments .",
    "for brevity we focus on the simplest among the experimentally realistic situations .",
    "thus , we consider monodispersed ssdna targets and monodispersed oligonucleotide probes .",
    "this avoids complication due to unspecified polydispersity and to competitive bulk hybridization .",
    "it is convenient to concentrate on the @xmath53 case with @xmath23 .",
    "as we shall see , this makes for a simpler discussion of the brush effects .",
    "it also allows us to ignore small corrections due to probe - probe interactions .",
    "finally , our analysis assumes dna chips with a passivated surface and probes anchored to the surface via short , flexible spacer chains .",
    "our analysis is concerned with the modifications of the hybridization isotherm and rate equations as @xmath18 decreases from the langmuir range , @xmath54 , into the brush regime , @xmath55 . to implement this program ,",
    "it is helpful to identify a reference state . in the following",
    "we utilize a probe layer that approaches the bulk values for the hybridization rate and equilibrium constants .",
    "we argue that this is the case when the following conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , the surface is perfectly non - adsorbing to both ss and ds dna . under these conditions",
    "adsorbed states are not involved in the hybridization reaction and the two state approximation for the hybridization reaction is justified .",
    "second , the probes are attached to the surface via _ long _ , flexible and neutral spacers .",
    "we argue that the effect of the surface diminishes as the length of the spacers increases .",
    "note that the spacers modify two effects .",
    "one is the steric hindrance that occurs when the probes are directly attached to the surface .",
    "the other is the reduction in the number of accessible configurations in the vicinity of an impenetrable planar surface .",
    "idealy , the reference state involves spacer chains that do not interact with either the probes and the targets .",
    "the third condition is that the distance between the anchored probes ensures zero probe - probe interaction energy , irrespective of their hybridization state . for this reference state ,",
    "the equilibrium hybridization constant at the surface @xmath56 approaches @xmath57 , the equilibrium hybridization constant for the bulk reaction between the free chains .",
    "accordingly , the hybridization isotherm in the small spot limit , when the hybridization at the surface has a negligible effect on initial molar concentration of the target @xmath10 , is @xmath58 it is important to distinguish between @xmath56 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the molar standard hybridization free energy as obtained from the nearest neighbor model ( santalucia and hicks , 2004 ) , @xmath32 is the temperature and @xmath61 is the gas constant .",
    "first , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as calculated from the nearest neighbor model are identical for all @xmath64 .",
    "they allow , at most , for the effect of two dangling ends .",
    "second , this model incorporates only nearest neighbor interactions along the backbone of the chain .",
    "it thus assumes that the oligonucleotide adopts the configuration of an ideal random coil .",
    "in particular , @xmath65 does not account for excluded volume interactions between the monomers . in addition , @xmath60 clearly does not allow for the effect of the impenetrable wall or for the interactions between the hybridized targets or between them and the neighboring probes .",
    "these additional terms and their effect on the hybridization isotherm will be discussed in the following three sections .",
    "our choice of the parameters used in the numerical calculations is based on two experimental systems .",
    "one , of guo et al . ( 1994 ) , utilized probes of length @xmath66 with pcr produced targets of length @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "both ssdna and dsdna were investigated , the area per probe was varied in the range @xmath69 and the hybridization was carried out at @xmath70 .",
    "the hybridization times varied with @xmath6 being @xmath71 for @xmath67 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 . note that in this study some of the data corresponds to the @xmath74 regime where probe - probe interactions are not negligible .",
    "the second system is the affymetrix genechip e. coli antisense genome array ( affymetrix , 2004 ) . in this case ,",
    "probes of length @xmath75 hybridize with fragmented , thus polydispersed , ds cdna targets with average length in the range @xmath76 .",
    "the hybridization is carried out at @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "a rough approximation of @xmath18 for affymetrix chips was obtained from the estimated density of functional groups in the substrate prior to the synthesis of the probes : @xmath79 , and the step - wise yield of the synthesis , @xmath80 . only @xmath81 attain @xmath82 ( forman et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this estimate yields @xmath83 . in both systems",
    "the hybridization was carried out in a solution containing @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "the base sequence of the probes considered in the calculations and their thermodynamic parameters for hybridization , as calculated using the nearest neighbor model with a perfectly matched target ( santalucia , 1998 ; peyret et al . , 1999 ; hyther@xmath84 ) , are specified in table 1 .",
