    "the katrin tritium @xmath1decay experiment expects to set an improved upper limit of 0.2 ev on the @xmath2 effective mass , @xmath3(eff ) after 3 years of data taking , or it might discover the actual value at a @xmath4 level if @xmath3(eff ) @xmath5 ev .",
    "@xcite in single @xmath1decay the effective mass can be defined in terms of the separate mass states having masses @xmath6 contributing to the @xmath2 state :  @xcite @xmath7    to find a value for @xmath3(eff ) from the tritium @xmath1 spectrum one can do a fit of the distribution of the electron kinetic energies , @xmath8 near the endpoint @xmath9 using the phase space term , i.e. , the square of the kurie function @xmath10 where :  @xcite    @xmath11    and where @xmath12 is the ramp function defined by @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 note that here @xmath17 is understood to be given by the decay q - value , which is the true spectrum endpoint only when one ignores final state distributions , and the acceptance of an experiment for energies close to @xmath18 moreover , fits using eq .",
    "2 are only appropriate if the separate @xmath6 are not distinguishable experimentally . otherwise , the proper procedure is to fit the spectrum near @xmath17 using @xmath19 defined as :  @xcite    @xmath20    which essentially describes a sum of spectra for each of the @xmath6 with weight @xmath21 eq .",
    "[ a3 ] has been used , for example , in searches for a possible sterile mass state .",
    "@xcite another use of eq .",
    "[ a3 ] was made by the author in ref .",
    "@xcite in testing his @xmath0 model of the neutrino mass states consisting of three l - r doublets having unconventionally large masses . in that paper",
    "it was shown that this model gave excellent fits to the data from three existing high precision tritium @xmath1 decay experiments done by the troitsk , mainz and livermore groups without necessarily being in conflict with the cosmological constraint on @xmath22 or oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , those good fits to the model were obtained despite the @xmath23 c.l .",
    "upper limit @xmath3(eff)@xmath24 ev  @xcite two of those experiments have set on @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 model postulates three @xmath25 doublets having masses that were originally inferred from an analysis of @xmath26 data  @xcite .",
    "the model was given subsequent support by dark matter fits to the milky way galaxy and to four galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite the masses of the three doublets are : @xmath27 ev , @xmath28 ev , and @xmath29 kev@xmath30 or @xmath31 ev .",
    "each of the three masses would , in accordance with eq .",
    "3 , create a specific feature in the spectrum .",
    "the three features include : ( a ) a kink at @xmath32 ( b ) a second kink at @xmath33 and ( c ) a linear variation of @xmath34 between that second kink and @xmath18 as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the only detectable effect on the spectral shape given the limited statistics of existing data sets is the first kink occuring at @xmath35 ev . in fact",
    ", this feature was found to exist in all three data sets examined with a common spectral weight @xmath36      the purpose of the present paper is to consider six topics that were not addressed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , each of which will be seen to strengthen the case for taking the unconventional @xmath0 model more seriously .",
    "thus , it is shown here that :    1 .",
    "the good fits the model gave to three existing tritium @xmath1 decay data sets are very likely not an artifact resulting from final state distributions ( fsd s ) .",
    "these fsd s alter the predicted @xmath0 model results for katrin without making them any less observable .",
    "3 .   a less radical alternative explanation to the good fits the @xmath0 model gave to three tritium @xmath1decay experiments ,",
    "i.e. , an @xmath37 ev sterile neutrino , is implausible .",
    "while the troitsk collaboration has retracted its controversial  step \" in the spectrum  @xcite , thereby raising serious questions about its inclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are nevertheless grounds for regarding the report of its demise as premature",
    "the need for a precise understanding of the value of all systematic uncertainties ( vital for katrin s intended goal ) is significantly less important if the data should be in accord with the @xmath0 model .",
    "katrin will have the sensitivity to look for all three parts of the 3 + 3 model signature , and in fact will be able it to validate or reject the model in a mere two days of data - taking .    * final state distributions ( fsd s ) * ( a ) shows the distribution of molecular energy levels in tritium gas according to saenz et al .",
    "@xcite , ( b ) shows the @xmath38 distribution of energy losses by electrons in single inelastic scattering , and ( c ) shows the @xmath39 distribution of energy losses for any number of scatterings expected in the katrin experiment . ]      since publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested to the author  @xcite that the good fits of the @xmath0 model to @xmath1decay data might be explained due to the presence of fsd s that will distort the observed spectrum .",
    "the two types of final state distributions considered here include molecular excitations , and scattering processes in the source which lead to @xmath1electron energy loss .",
    "both processes lead to a modification of the endpoint region of the spectrum , but they have a very different nature .",
    "the former includes possible final states of a diatomic molecule containing tritium , i.e. , @xmath40 going to @xmath41 which can be populated before beta decay , and which change the emitted @xmath42 electron energy distribution from what is found when assuming a decay q - value for a @xmath43 molecule in its ground state .",
    "the latter process lowers the observed energy of electrons after emission , and the distribution of losses depends on the number of scatterings .",
    "the distribution of electron energy loss in single inelastic scattering @xmath38 is the same for all experiments using gaseous tritium ",
    "see fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "however , the distribution of losses for any number of scatterings , i.e. , @xmath44 shown in fig . 1 ( c ) for katrin is experiment dependent because the probabilities @xmath45 for n scatterings depend on the average column density of radioactive tritium gas , i.e. , the number of mean free paths , n according to the poisson distribution : @xmath46    the sharp peaks in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) at @xmath47 ev , and the much smaller one at @xmath48",
    "ev in fig .",
    "1(c ) are due to single and double inelastic scatterings , respectively .",
    "the presence of the small 25 ev peak and the broader one in fig .",
    "1(a ) at a slightly higher energy , suggest the possibility of one or both of these peaks being the true cause of the good fits reported in ref .",
    "@xcite rather than the @xmath0 model .",
    "@xcite in order to test this possibility we have done a simulation and generated spectra for both the @xmath0 model and the standard all @xmath49 or @xmath3(eff)@xmath50 case using the following 5-step procedure :     * simulated katrin data based on @xmath0 model * for a day of data - taking , i.e. , one hour of data - taking for each of 24 energy bins of 0.5 ev width .",
    "the solid curve ( with 10x inflated error bars for clarity ) is the expected count rate above background .",
    "the long dashed curve , which has the same count rate at 20 ev , shows shows the  kink - free \" all @xmath49 case after fsd s and energy resolution have been included .",
    "the short dashed curve shown with slightly larger normalization ( for clarity ) is the @xmath0 model prediction before including fsd s and energy resolution .",
    "the thick grey curve represents a failed attempt to mimic the @xmath0 model results based on an anomalous energy loss distribution including a large amplitude @xmath51-function , as discussed in the text . ]",
    "1 .   using the expected value of n for a particular experiment ,",
    "find the @xmath52 using eq .",
    "do a convolution of the original spectrum defined by eq .",
    "[ a3 ] with the @xmath43 excitation probability to find an  excitation modified \" @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "3 .   find the inelastic scattering distributions , @xmath53 corresponding to n scatterings by convolving the single scattering function with itself n times , and then find the resultant energy loss function @xmath39 for @xmath54 scatterings 4 .",
    "do a convolution of the excitation modified spectrum with @xmath39 to yield the fsd - modified spectrum @xmath55 5 .",
    "do a convolution of @xmath56 with a gaussian - distributed resolution function having an appropriate fwhm to yield a final spectrum that incorporates the effect of fsd s and resolution .",
    "the results of this simulation are shown in two figures in order to display better the distortions of the spectrum expected in two spectral regions surrounding each kink .",
    "it can easily be seen in fig .",
    "2 that the impact of fsd s and resolution on the spectrum is to round off the abruptness of a kink , without making it less observable .",
    "the long dashed curve in fig .",
    "2 ( the fsd - modified spectrum for the all @xmath49 case ) shows that while fsd s clearly do alter the spectrum shape near 20 ev they do not create a kink in the spectrum there when one is not originally present , i.e. , when the initial spectrum is parabolic .",
    "in fact the fsd - modified long dashed spectrum shows no observable inflection at the position of the kink and it can be approximated for the last 30 ev of the spectrum by a single power law of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58    in order to carry out steps 1 - 5 of the simulation one needs a value of n for a given experiment , which depends in part on whether a magnetic trap is used .",
    "in such a case only electrons which start with a certain range of pitch angles can pass the trap .",
    "this is less of a problem in katrin than some previous experiments in light of its good angular acceptance  see fig . 9 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows transmissions as high as a constant @xmath59 for electron energies more than 1 ev from the spectrum endpoint .",
    "katrin also has the advantages over earlier experiments of about four times better energy resolution ( @xmath60 ev ) and a very low background rate close to the endpoint .",
    "the expected background ( @xmath61 cps ) ,  @xcite is also a significant improvement over earlier experiments such as mainz by factors of 1.5 to 2.5 .",
    "@xcite finally , we note that katrin has a far more sophisticated method of finding the impact of electron energy loss on the spectrum than used here . by doing a three - dimensional simulation of the motion of individual electrons emitted at various points in the gas with various directions and energies",
    ", katrin can find the number of mean free paths n for them to reach the detector , assuming they make it past the trap .      finding an average n in a given experiment which uses a magnetic trap is difficult without doing the kind of three - dimensional simulation just described .",
    "thus , instead of doing unrealistic simulations for the three experiments examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , we instead consider what @xmath62 @xmath39 might create a kink in the spectrum near 20 ev roughly resembling that produced by the @xmath0 model , and how those results compare with those for katrin .",
    "it is clear that given the existence of a sharp peak in fig",
    ". 1 ( c ) at @xmath63 a @xmath39 distribution with a second sharp peak near 20 ev will result in a kink of some magnitude in the final convoluted distribution near @xmath64 ev .",
    "let us therefore assume an energy loss curve having a delta function of height a at 20 ev atop the @xmath65 curve in fig .",
    "1(c ) , and consider what values of a could produce a kink of the magnitude created by the @xmath0 model simulation .",
    "the result of such an exercise is shown by the thick semitransparent grey curve in fig .",
    "2 , where a detectable kink occurs at @xmath66 ev for a suitably large a value . however , not only is the kink less noticeable the one for the @xmath0 model , but the shape of the spectrum to the left of it is quite different , being concave up rather than down as that model yields .",
    "in addition , the value of a used to create the small kink is equivalent to an impossibly large @xmath67 the height of the double scattering peak or 7.7 ( i.e. , @xmath68 at least when using katrin values for the @xmath69    in light of this result one might question whether using @xmath52 from other experiments might also require an impossibly large double scattering peak , i.e , one large enough to mimic that of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the magnitude of the spectral kink produced from the two delta functions obviously would be proportional to the height of each one , and hence the product , @xmath70 we may therefore use @xmath71 to find @xmath72 which yields a maximum possible amplitude kink .",
    "the result is @xmath73 which yields @xmath74 and @xmath75    using the katrin value @xmath76  @xcite , we find @xmath77 so that @xmath78 in other words , we have shown @xmath79 since the katrin n - value is so close to yielding the maximum amplitude kink based on the two delta function model , we can infer that what is true for that experiment is also true for others .",
    "namely , if an impossibly large @xmath80 is required to produce a kink that mimicks of the @xmath0 model for katrin , then the same would be true for other experiments .    * simulated katrin data based on @xmath0 model * for a second day of data - taking in the region @xmath81 ev for one hour of data - taking for each of 24 energy bins of 0.5 ev width . the solid curve ( with non - inflated error bars ) is the expected count rate above background for one hour of data - taking for each of 24 energy bins of 0.5 ev width .",
    "it has been normalized to yield the expected count rate at @xmath64 ev .",
    "the dashed curve with the same normalization shows the  kink - free \" all @xmath49 case after fsd s and energy resolution have been included .",
    "the insert shows the last 5 ev with an expanded vertical scale . ]",
    "katrin will measure the number of counts @xmath82 in some time interval @xmath83 integrated over the energy region from @xmath84 to @xmath17 .",
    "thus , two such integral measurements are needed to find the differential intensity @xmath85 for a single energy bin @xmath86 experimenters must therefore choose carefully what region of the spectrum to measure , and how much data to take for each energy bin .",
    "apparently katrin intends to take data mainly over last 20 ev in light of the desire to minimize the effects of fsd s ,  @xcite and because this is where the effects of a finite @xmath87 are most important .    of course",
    ", taking data only for @xmath88 ev would exclude the energy where the first and most prominent @xmath0 model kink is predicted .",
    "it is therefore important to note that based on the simulation it should be possible to either confirm or reject the model using a mere two day s worth of data .",
    "that period would include 24 hours for each of about 24 energy bins @xmath89 ev wide centered on each of the two expected kinks . in generating simulated katrin data",
    "we have assumed an energy resolution of 0.93 ev , a @xmath90 and a count rate of @xmath91 for the last 1ev ,  @xcite which yields about @xmath92 counts per hour in a 0.5 ev wide bin at @xmath93 ev .",
    "the most prominent features of the simulated @xmath0 model results for katrin are the two rounded kinks at @xmath95 ev and @xmath96 ev . in addition , fig .",
    "3 also shows the feature associated with the @xmath94 mass state .",
    "we assumed earlier that eq .",
    "3 applies regardless of the sign of @xmath97 in that case for the @xmath94 state eq .",
    "3 yields a linear fall of the spectrum beyond the 4 ev kink , i.e. , @xmath98 whose slope should be in accord with the value of @xmath99 specified by the @xmath0 model .",
    "however , there is a different way the @xmath94 mass state might reveal itself in the event that eq .",
    "3 is inappropriate for tachyons .",
    "ciborowski and rembielinski  @xcite ( c - r ) and more recently radzikowski  @xcite have developed causal theories of tachyons which require the existence of a preferred frame of reference , perhaps that of the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) .",
    "let us assume the lab frame is close to being that preferred reference frame , which is certainly true for the cnb frame assumed to be the same as the cmb , for which @xmath100 in that case c - r predict that the @xmath94 component of the spectrum would have virtually constant height close to the spectrum endpoint .",
    "@xcite clearly , either possibility for the @xmath94 state , i.e. , a linear fall - off as depicted or a constant height beyond 3.5 ev as c - r predict should be readily distinguishable from the quadratic fall off expected for the all @xmath49 case ( the dashed curve )  see fig .",
    "3 . there is , however , an interesting difference between the two possibilities , should one of them be observed ( thereby confirming the existence of a tachyonic mass state ) .",
    "finding that the fall - off is linear would simultaneously reveal the actual mass of the state and disprove the c - r causal theory , while finding that there is no fall - off would validate that theory but not yield a mass value .",
    "katrin has made a major effort to understand all possible sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite they group sources of systematic uncertainty in four broad categories , having mostly to do with the tritium source .",
    "they further estimate the total systematic uncertainty in the effective mass squared of @xmath2 as @xmath101 ev@xmath102 , or about the same as the statistical uncertainty after 3 y of data taking .",
    "@xcite let us here assume that the katrin results closely resemble those of the @xmath0 model in figs . 2 and 3 after two days of data taking .",
    "if one does a one parameter fit of those results to the standard all @xmath49 curve , adjusting only its normalization one finds @xmath103 with 45 dof , thereby allowing this null hypothsis to be rejected with extreme confidence .",
    "this assertion depends on the use of @xmath104 and it ignores systematic uncertainties @xmath105 , which are normally combined in quadrature with @xmath106 i.e. , @xmath107 the ignoring of systematic uncertainties is justified here because if @xmath108 for 3 y of data taking then @xmath109 when the data taking period is only 2 d. as a result it can be said that if the data closely resembles the @xmath0 simulation results for 2 d of data taking , the null hypothesis ( all very small @xmath6 ) could be rejected with very high confidence .",
    "the existence of a possible sterile neutrino @xmath111 of mass @xmath112 ev would seem to be a much less extreme alternative to the @xmath0 model .",
    "however , while a 20 ev sterile neutrino could explain the good fits observed for three tritium decay exeriments , as well as the earlier @xmath26 data and the dark matter fits , there are some serious obstacles to this alternative :    1 .",
    "the three fits to tritium experiments required a large degree of mixing ( @xmath113 ) of the 20 ev state with the other states , and this would be ruled out by oscillation data , assuming a standard mass hierarchy .",
    "2 .   a 20 ev sterile neutrino could conceivably yield results similar to the @xmath0 model results in fig . 2 , but of course it would not agree with those in fig .",
    "3 , with the kink near 4 ev should it be observed .",
    "3 .   based on eq . 1 the 2 ev",
    "upper limit on the @xmath2 effective mass , and a much smaller limit from cosmology on the sum of the _ flavor _ state masses , only the existence of a @xmath94 mass state could keep @xmath2 effective mass very small .",
    "@xcite    if the actual katrin data should closely resemble the simulated results for the @xmath0 model in figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "experimenters would be severely challenged to explain them in terms of fsd s or other systematic effects and the standard view of small neutrino masses .",
    "the author is indebted to hamish robertson for calling attention to the possibility that the good fits reported in ref .",
    "@xcite might be due to fsd s rather than the @xmath0 model , and for his critical comments on an earlier version of this manuscript .",
    "the inclusion of the 1999 troitsk data in ref .",
    "@xcite with its controversial  step \" might be challenged , because in a 2012 reassessment  @xcite , after failing to explain this feature for over a decade , the troitsk authors upon dropping some uncalibrated runs , concluded that  within the existing statistical errors , there are no reasons for introducing such a feature . \"",
    "@xcite in fact , one of the troitsk authors has gone even further .",
    "v. s. pantuev , in a private communication , has noted that troitsk no longer bothers to display the actual spectrum because :  in [ the ] new analysis this step is absolutely invisible by eye in the spectrum .",
    "\"  @xcite .",
    "can this really be the case ?",
    "while the reanalyzed troitsk data did result in a @xmath114 smaller amplitude step than originally seen , the grounds for dropping this feature are not as clear as troitsk suggests . as can be seen in fig .",
    "8 of the 2012 reassessment  @xcite , given the error bars at various times of the year the average step amplitude can be computed as @xmath115 this result may fall short of the @xmath4 criterion for a discovery , which perhaps would justifytroitsk ridding themselves of their unexplained anomaly on statistical grounds .",
    "nevertheless , a @xmath116 step in the spectrum is hardly insignificant , and it would be very surprising if such an effect could not be seen in the spectrum .",
