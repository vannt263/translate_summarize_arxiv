    "entanglement is a unique property of quantum multisystems , where the state of one system is not independent on the others @xcite .",
    "entanglement serves as the main tool in fundamental research of quantum theory as well as in the rapidly - developing area of quantum information @xcite .",
    "photons are prominent quantum systems due to their weak interaction with the environment which increase their immunity to decoherence . on the other side",
    "this weak interaction makes the creation of an entangled state of photons a difficult task that usually requires a very high nonlinearity . in the early days of quantum optics sources of entanglement",
    "were atomic cascades @xcite , but nowadays the main source for entangled photons is the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "this is an efficient source that can create polarization @xcite or time - bin entanglement @xcite , but has two major drawbacks for efficient quantum communication schemes .",
    "namely , it is not deterministic and has a broadband spectrum .",
    "deterministic single photon sources include quantum dots , single atoms in a cavity and atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "atomic ensembles offer another asset , which is the generation and storage of a single photon in a heralded way .",
    "this is the main building block for a quantum repeater as proposed in the dlcz protocol for long range quantum communication @xcite .",
    "single photon storage times of up to a few ms were observed using trapped rubidium ensembles @xcite and a few tens of @xmath0 using warm vapor @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ability to store a multi photon entangled state from an spdc source was also shown @xcite . recently , several alternatives to spdc as an entanglement source were presented .",
    "quantum dot biexcitons were developed as an efficient source for entangled photons that can be created in a triggered way @xcite . using a single quantum dot ensures a single pair of entangled photons , but the yield up until now is not high compared to spdc .",
    "moreover the photons are emitted together and are still broadband with respect to the needs of quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "new schemes of exploiting atomic media as an entanglement source were also presented .",
    "one proposal uses a double-@xmath1 level configuration for a deterministic entanglement of n photons @xcite .",
    "this procedure suffers mostly from the difficulty of working with one atom in a cavity .",
    "another promising direction for entangled photon source is the use of non linear effects in atomic ensembles such as four wave mixing @xcite and rydberg blockade @xcite .",
    "porras and cirac suggested a use of an excited symmetric spin wave in double @xmath1 atoms as a way to entangle photons in a deterministic way @xcite .    here",
    "we take this idea in a different direction and apply it in an atomic ensemble .",
    "we utilize single photon quantum storage in atomic gases combined with the property of zeeman splitting of hyperfine manifolds in order to create a heralded polarization entanglement .",
    "the scheme relies on using the magnetic zeeman levels as an effective polarization beam splitter for single photons in order to entangle the two photons .",
    "this source creates two polarization entangled photons that are distinguished in time and have a narrow bandwidth that can be suitable for quantum communication @xcite .",
    "we show the dependence of the fidelity and pair production rate upon the detection efficiency . this paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sec : general - scheme ] the general scheme of the entanglement process",
    "is described .",
    "section [ sec : fidelity - and - experimental ] discusses the practical limitations of the scheme and how the fidelity and production rate of the entangled pair is affected by them .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] gives some concluding remarks .",
    "the general sequence for creating heralded entanglement is presented schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : schematics ] . as the source for entanglement we use an atomic ensemble with n atoms .",
    "each atom has a @xmath1 configuration energy level scheme .",
    "each energy level should contain its own zeeman sublevel manifold , such as a hyperfine splitting with f>0 . without loss of generality we will concentrate here on the case where the long lived ground state @xmath2 has a hyperfine level with f=1 , the long lived metastable level",
    ", @xmath3 has a hyperfine level with f=2 and the excited state @xmath4 is f=2 .",
    "one specific example that fits to this case is the d1 transition of @xmath5 .",
    "each hyperfine level has zeeman sublevels that become non degenerate when applying a magnetic field .",
    "a schematic picture of the relevant levels is depicted in figure [ fig : write level scheme ] .",
    "using a circular polarized pumping it is possible to transfer all the population to the @xmath6 level which is the @xmath7 state .",
    "the collective state of the atoms and light can be written as follows :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the state of zero photons in a defined spatial and spectral mode .",
    "this mode will be defined later as the stokes or anti stokes ( as ) mode .",
    "schematics of the experiment .",
    "each of the two atoms shown represents one of the n states in the sum of the dicke state.,width=325 ]    immediately after the pumping , a weak and short write pulse with a circular @xmath10 polarization is applied to the ensemble .",
    "the laser detuning should be large enough in order for the main atom light interaction to be a spontaneous raman transition to the @xmath3 state .",
    "since the circular polarization dictates a transition to the zeeman sublevel @xmath11 , the spontaneous raman decay can be to levels @xmath12 , but since @xmath13 the transition to @xmath14 is forbidden and the other two sublevels have the same probability @xcite .",
    "thus , upon a successful detection of one photon in one of the polarizations @xmath10 or @xmath15 , the spin state of the metastable level will become @xmath16 or @xmath17 respectively .",
    "if for example the detected photon is @xmath10 then the collective state will be    @xmath18    where @xmath19 means that the @xmath20th atom is now at the state @xmath16 while all other atoms are in the ground @xmath7 state .",
    "@xmath21 means a stokes photon with @xmath10 polarization is emitted , @xmath22 is the write laser wave vector , @xmath23 is the stokes photon wave vector and @xmath24 is the coordinate of the @xmath20th atom .",
    "the atomic state is in a dicke - like state @xcite .",
    "this is a long lived atomic coherence where the main decoherence process is the atomic motion that can change the phases between the different atomic states @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will assume no motion , meaning that these phases do not alter during the storage time .",
    "in this case , upon applying a read pulse with a perfect phase matching condition @xmath25 , a constructive interference in the direction of the as wave vector will cause this mode to dominate all other directions @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of no atomic motion and perfect phase matching , the phase terms just sum up to unity so it is possible to omit them from now on .",

    "red arrow - write beam , green and blue arrows - stokes photons .",
    ", width=325 ]    now it is possible to quickly repeat the write pulse in order to create another excitation in the metastable state ( of course , this pulse will create an excitation only with low probability , but since it is a heralded scheme , we are looking only upon successful events ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the events where the second stokes photon that is emitted has the opposite polarization than the first one , thus the collective state will be now    @xmath26    after a certain storage time , a @xmath15 polarization read pulse is sent into the media .",
    "this pulse can interact with one of the excited dicke states releasing with some probability one as photon .",
    "there are two possibilities , one that the atoms are in the @xmath17 state and one that the atoms are in the @xmath16 state .",
    "each of these options can produce different as single photons as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : anti - stokes level scheme ]",
    ". the as transition strengths may not be the same due to different clebschgordan coefficients , thus there is a need to multiply each transition with the proper probability amplitude denoted by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the zeeman sublevel of the excited state , @xmath29 is the zeeman sublevel of the ground state and @xmath30 is the hyperfine level of the ground state .    the possible alternatives for single as photon generation during the read process .",
    "orange arrows - read beam , blue , dashed blue and yellow arrows - as photons.,width=325 ]    the as photon polarization is correlated with the atomic spin level that remains in the ensemble and the state becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the relaxation of the first as photon to the zeeman ground state sublevels @xmath34 or @xmath35 respectively .    now a magnetic field is applied to the ensemble creating a zeeman splitting of the @xmath3 , @xmath2 states .",
    "the two zeeman levels will acquire a different phase during the single excitation storage time according to the energy splitting .",
    "for an energy splitting @xmath36 in the @xmath3 level and @xmath37 in the @xmath2 level and after a storage time @xmath38 the state will become    @xmath39    sending another read pulse strong enough to create a second as photon will produce the following state @xcite : +    @xmath40    where the @xmath41 notations represent the emitted as photon during the first or second read pulse respectively and @xmath42 .",
    "for simplicity in the following we will abbreviate @xmath43 etc .",
    ", hence the state can be written as    @xmath44    since there is a sum over all the ensemble , the time ordering may be switched and different indices for the atoms can be dropped . as @xmath32 is just the ground state",

    ". the most interesting case will be for storage time where the phase is @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the first term vanishes and the photonic state is just a rotated maximally entangled bell state @xmath49 .",
    "the previous section dealt with an ideal case . for real applications",
    "there are a few issues that needs to be answered regarding the scheme we presented .",
    "the main two issues are the coherence time and the fidelity of the process .      in order for",
    "the scheme to succeed the coherence time of the collective state of the atoms should be much longer than the experiment time .",
    "a typical coherence can reach up to 1 ms in cold atoms and a few hundred @xmath0 in warm vapor @xcite .",
    "in warm vapor the spatial coherence of the collective spin state limits the lifetime .",
    "measurements in rubidium of single photon storage reveal a quantum nature up to 5 @xmath0 @xcite . for a 0.1 @xmath0 time storage with magnetic field , the frequency shift for substantial phase shift will be on the order of 10 mhz meaning a magnetic field of @xmath5010 g. switching on and off such a field with a 100 ns time scale is achievable .",
    "the fidelity of the entangled state is affected by three major contributions .",
    "the first one is having more than one excited stokes / anti stokes photon per write / read pulse , the second one is the detection efficiency and the third one is the detector s dark counts @xcite . in general , for spontaneous raman scattering the state after a write pulse can be written as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the probability of exciting @xmath53 atoms in the specific mode and @xmath54 is a state with @xmath53 stokes photons .",
    "for low excitation number each excitation is independent , thus this probability will have a poisson distribution defined by parameter @xmath55 , which is the average excitation number . in order to have only a single excitation , at most , due to each write pulse we need to use a weak pulse such that @xmath56 . moreover , each photon is detected with a lower probability due to detectors efficiencies , fiber couplings , and filters .",
    "two stokes photons can be produced via two processes : two photons in one of the pulses and zero in the second and one photon in each write pulse . for our experiment",
    "both options are fine , as long as the creation of three photons will be negligible .",
    "since the process of creating n stokes photons is a poisson process , we can calculate the probability of two and three photons events using the probability of a one photon event .",
    "we note also that lower detection efficiency may cause three photons to be detected as two , for example . in the case",
    "two photons are created the probability to detect them is of course dependent upon the detection efficiency @xmath57 and will be in our case @xmath58 .",
    "the probability of detecting only two photons while exciting @xmath53 atoms will be @xmath59 .",
    "dark counts also contribute to lower the fidelity by adding a false detected photon .",
    "the probability for one dark count per pulse up to first order will be @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the probability for a dark count per pulse that is related to the length of the pulse .    in order to quantify the total fidelity of the state created and the rate of successful events we assume a post selected measurement where we measure one as photon after each read pulse . in this case",
    "a successful event is regarded as an event where two stokes photons are created and detected with different polarization , thus the probability of such an event is @xmath62 .",
    "false events are all the events with excitation number @xmath63 that lead to a detection of two stokes photons .",
    "figure [ fig : succes_fault ] shows the probabilities of false and successful events as a function of the poisson parameter . here we take a detection efficiency of @xmath64 and dark counts rate of 10 hz @xcite , thus for a 100 ns pulse @xmath65 .",
    "the fidelity can be taken as the ratio between false and successful probabilities , thus a fidelity of 95% is achievable using a poisson parameter @xmath66 .",
    "probability for a successful and false events as a function of the poisson parameter ( blue - successful event , green - false event ) .",

    "inset shows the ratio between the events probabilities .",
    ", width=325 ]    figure [ fig : probability graph ] presents the probabilities of the main false events .",
    "the predominant false events in low @xmath55 are dark counts in the detector while high @xmath55 suffers mostly from events related to false detection of higher excitation modes due to the imperfect detection efficiency .",
    "it is important to notice that there is a trade off between maximizing the rate of successful events ( larger @xmath55 ) and minimizing the false detection of higher events ( smaller @xmath55 ) .",
    "probabilities of the main events that can contribute to a post selected experiment when two stokes photons and two as photons are detected .",
    "the notation p(s(n);as(m ) ) represents the actual number of photons + dark counts that are created in the experiment .",
    "p(s(2);as(2 ) ) is a successful event , while all others contribute to false events .",
    "the sum of all these false events is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : succes_fault ] . , width=325 ]    the possible rate of a two photon entanglement source ( disregarding the detection efficiency of the as photon ) can be estimated by calculating the potential probability for a successful experiment which is @xmath68 , where the half is due to detections of @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the optimal probability for one as emission according to binomial distribution with a total of two excitations .",
    "this ensures maximal rate for the read process .",
    "this probability will create an entangled pair with fidelity of 95% . assuming a repetition rate of 10 mhz , bounded by pumping rate due to the natural lifetime of the atoms ,",
    "the successful experiment rate will be @xmath5010 khz .",
    "this calculation takes into account the best up to date detectors , with minimal fiber coupling losses .",
    "a more conventional setup may have lower detection efficiencies of @xmath5030% .",
    "this will lower the rate substantially to @xmath50100 hz for the same fidelity .",
    "the tremendous progress in the field of single photon detection @xcite implies that even higher rates will be possible in the near future .",
    "a scheme for the creation of a polarization entanglement between two photons using atomic ensemble was presented .",
    "this scheme relies on the fact that optical transitions between zeeman sublevels in the single photon regime may act as a polarization beam splitter . taking experimental restrictions to consideration",
    "we estimate a fidelity that can reach up to 95% with entangled pair production rate of 10 khz .",
    "combined with the ability to store the photons as a polariton in the ensemble this scheme has the potential to become a useful source for quantum communication beyond current available sources .",
