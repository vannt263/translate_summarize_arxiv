    "the 1d spin systems have been providing problems of both physical and mathematical interests . among them , there exists a family of solvable models of heisenberg type with spin-@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this includes , for instance , @xmath3 as @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "ground state properties as well as low lying excitations have been elucidated by the powerful machinery of solvable models , the bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in many contexts @xcite that the underlying field theory is level @xmath1 su(2 ) wzwn model @xcite .",
    "although this 1d quantum model is equivalent to a 2d vertex model , physical excitations carry both natures of vertex models and restricted sos models .",
    "this is firstly demonstrated in @xcite based on the @xmath5 matrix argument .",
    "the space of states is identified in @xcite . by decomposition of crystals ,",
    "such double feature is made explicit in terms of `` type of domain walls '' and `` type of domain '' .",
    "there are independent justifications of this : the double feature in the spectral decomposition is shown by path space approach@xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the decomposition of space picture realized in fermionic forms .    here",
    "we are interested in the finite temperature problem .",
    "standard arguments employ the string hypothesis@xcite .",
    "the excitation is described not in terms of `` physical excitations '' in the above sense , but in the `` string basis '' .",
    "there strings of arbitrary lengths are allowed , which results into infinitely many coupled integral equations among infinitely many unknown functions .",
    "the description successfully reproduces the expected specific heat anomaly .",
    "it may not be , however , best suitable for practical numerics .",
    "we revisit the problem via the recently developed commuting quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) approach @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the formulation does not reply on the string hypothesis .",
    "rather , it only relies on analyticity structures of the object called qtm@xcite .",
    "the problem of the combinatorial summation , i.e. , evaluation of the partition function , then reduces to investigations on the analyticity of suitably chosen auxiliary functions . up to now , two kinds of choices are adopted independently .",
    "\\(a ) the eigenvalue of the qtm as given by the quantum inverse scattering method consists of several terms .",
    "the auxiliary functions are chosen from combinations of products of these terms @xcite .",
    "a convenient choice leads to a finite number of coupled non - linear integral equations for a finite number of unknown functions    \\(b ) a set of auxiliary functions may be chosen from the fusion hierarchy among `` generalized '' qtms @xcite .",
    "generically , one obtains an infinite number of coupled non - linear integral equations for an infinite number of unknown functions .",
    "this can be shown to recover the conventional tbas based on the string hypothesis .",
    "of course , the new approach is entirely free of any assumption about excitations like string hypothesis .",
    "the spin-1 case is analyzed in the related problem , in the context of finite size corrections@xcite .",
    "there six functions are introduced in the spirit of ( a ) .",
    "the structure of nlie among them is much more involved in comparison to the spin-1/2 case , and seems to defy a simple - minded generalization to higher @xmath2 cases . in a sense",
    "the most subtle point in the qtm approach appears ; one does not know a priori `` better '' set of auxiliary functions .    here ,",
    "we adopt other choice of auxiliary functions , in particular for the spin 1 case the number of these functions is 3 in contrast to 6 as in @xcite .",
    "a simple idea of combining the two formulations ( a ) and ( b ) works well so that the generalization to arbitrary @xmath2 is possible .",
    "the adopted functions agree with the picture in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the fusion part ( b ) of the auxiliary functions is related to the rsos piece of the excitation , while auxiliary functions from ( a ) correspond to spinons .",
    "we remark that the fusion hierarchy itself is not truncated , by brute force , into finite set .",
    "instead , the spinon part makes the functional relations among them strictly closed .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath6 coupled integral equations for @xmath6 unknown functions .",
    "besides the practical advantage , it implies the universality in the description of thermodynamics of solvable quantum 1d chains , i.e. , the description only in terms of objects which reduce to physical excitations in @xmath7 .",
    "this has been already demonstrated for several models in highly correlated 1d electron systems including the supersymmetric @xmath8 model @xcite , the supersymmetric extended hubbard model @xcite and the hubbard model @xcite . there",
    "the exact thermodynamics are formulated in terms of `` spinons '' and `` holons '' , although they lose sense at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "the present study adds one successful example even in the fusion models and gives further supports on the above conjecture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the main object in this approach , the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) . a minimal information of the novel approach is sketched .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief description of the fusion hierarchy of generalized qtms .",
    "after these preparations , we introduce auxiliary functions and examine functional relations among them in section 4 .",
    "the analytic structure studied numerically leads to nonlinear integral equations as discussed in section 5 .",
    "based on these equations the low temperature asymptotics is studied analytically in section 6 .",
    "the central charge of the level @xmath1 su(2 ) wzwn model is successfully recovered .",
    "we also present the numerical evaluation of specific heat of @xmath9 models for wider ranges of temperatures . in section 7 , the implication of the present formulation to the spinon character formula of the wzwn model @xcite is discussed .",
    "the summary of the paper is given in section 8 .",
    "the present qtm formulation originates from two ingredients : the equivalence theorem between 1d quantum and 2d classical systems @xcite on one side and the integrability structure on the other@xcite . especially , the latter provides the way to introduce commuting qtms which reduce the problem of combinatorial counting to that of analyticity of suitable auxiliary functions@xcite .",
