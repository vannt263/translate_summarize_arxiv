    "its precise black - body spectrum places stringent bounds on alternative cosmologies .",
    "its large scale anisotropies uncover tiny fluctuations in the gravitational potential , most likely the same that once upon a time led to the formation of galaxies and other large scale structure in the universe .",
    "the polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation constitute yet another set of observables whose eventual measurement is still to bear fruit",
    ". a positive measurement of a degree of polarization would provide much further insight into the universe history and evolution .",
    "the current bound on the degree of linear polarization of the cmb on large angular scales , @xmath1 @xcite , already serves to set limits and constraints upon alternative cosmological scenarios .",
    "the fact that anisotropic thomson scattering of photons and electrons around the time of decoupling induces a degree of linear polarization in the cosmic microwave background@xcite was pointed out shortly after its discovery in 1965 .",
    "several estimates were made of the degree of polarization expected .",
    "the task is to evaluate the stokes parameters of the photon distribution function , which satisfies a boltzmann equation with a thomson scattering collisional term@xcite .",
    "the first computations were performed in homogeneous but anisotropically expanding universes@xcite .",
    "energy - density fluctuations @xcite and long wavelength gravitational waves @xcite were also considered as the source of the anisotropy that leads to polarization .",
    "typically , at least within standard recombination histories , the degree of linear polarization turns out to be almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the large scale temperature anisotropy .",
    "this is still well beyond current detection capabilities .",
    "nevertheless , with large scale anisotropies in the cmb now positively measured by cobe - dmr@xcite and other experiments , it is worthwhile to further analyse the predictions for the cmb polarization properties within alternative realistic cosmological models , and its dependence upon various parameters .",
    "very detailed numerical computations of the cmb temperature fluctuations and polarization correlation functions on all angular scales were performed by bond and efstathiou@xcite for standard @xmath2 cold dark matter dominated universes , with scale invariant adiabatic or isocurvature scalar fluctuations .",
    "it is one of the purposes of the present paper to reproduce the most significant features of the multipole expansion of the polarization correlation function on all angular scales in this cosmological model from an analytic approach , to better highlight its dependence upon various parameters . to achieve that goal , in section ii",
    "we develop a method and perform approximations that very closely parallel the recent analytic approach introduced by hu and sugiyama to evaluate the temperature anisotropies on all angular scales for the unpolarized case@xcite . in section iii the multipole expansion of the polarization correlation function is performed , and an expression for the total degree of linear polarization is derived . in section",

    "the boltzmann equations for the photon distribution function in realistic cold dark matter cosmological models with energy - density linear fluctuations have been numerically solved , and the predictions for the cmb temperature correlation function on all angular scales have been analised in great detail@xcite .",
    "the boltzmann code was also used to study the dependence of the microwave background anisotropies upon various cosmological parameters@xcite . notwithstanding the thoroughness of these numerical studies , it is very useful to have some analytic approximation to the exact solution , to gain even further insight into the nature and origin of the cmb anisotropies . some analytic methods and approximations to compute with reasonable accuracy",
    "the cmb anisotropies on all angular scales were recently developed@xcite , improving upon the original work of sachs and wolfe@xcite .",
    "here we extend to the polarized case the analytic approach that hu and sugiyama introduced to compute cmb anisotropies@xcite .",
    "the method is in turn an extension of the standard tight coupling analysis@xcite to include realistic time dependent gravitational potentials , described in a gauge invariant formalism@xcite .",
    "it is based upon an expansion of the cmb temperature fluctuation in inverse powers of the differential optical depth . in the tight coupling regime , when the effectiveness of thomson scattering of cmb photons with free electrons makes the differential optical depth high , a perturbative expansion to first order constitutes a very good approximation to the exact result .",
    "while photons and baryons are tightly coupled , all higher multipoles of the temperature fluctuation can be evaluated in terms of the monopole , which in turn obeys the equation of a forced and damped oscillator@xcite .",
    "we will see now how to include the polarization dependence of thomson scattering into this formalism .",
    "the cmb gauge - invariant temperature fluctuation for a given direction of observation , described in terms of polar angles @xmath3 , is the relative temperature fluctuation around the mean evaluated in the shear - free ( newtonian ) gauge : @xmath4 .",
    "we compute first the temperature fluctuations induced by only one fourier mode of the scalar fluctuations in the gravitational potential , with wave - vector @xmath5 .",
    "then it is convenient to use a reference frame such that @xmath6 , since there is axial symmetry around the direction of @xmath5 .",
    "the degree of linear polarization , @xmath7 , is defined in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9@xcite of the cmb radiation .",

    "this means that photons were able to travel a distance of order @xmath63 between their last two scatterings .",
    "this is the time the quadrupole had to grow , and thus the final polarization should be proportional to @xmath64 . to see that this is indeed the case , we perform the integrals leading to @xmath65 around decoupling and to @xmath7 under the following approximations , analogous to those in refs.@xcite .",

    "the degree of polarization is thus largest for modes of wavelength comparable to @xmath62 .    in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "the expression ( [ soldp ] ) reduces to our previous analytic estimate of the polarization on large angular scales@xcite , based on the method developed by polnarev@xcite , once the dependence of @xmath60 with the gravitational potentials is replaced .",
    "the polarization properties of the cmb are very sensitive to the details of the ionization history , and could very well serve to trace it back@xcite .",
    "the proportionality in @xmath62 in our solution is a hint of this . in a scenario with an appreciable reionization ,",
    "the polarization would increase , because the quadrupole of the temperature anisotropy in the electron s rest frame , which is the source of polarization , would be greatly enhanced .",
    "a very important conclusion that can be drawn from eq .",
    "( [ soldp ] ) is that one can determine the value of the dipole of the temperature fluctuations at recombination measuring the present polarization properties of the cmb radiation , at least if there was no reionization after recombination .",
    "this is a very interesting perspective , since it could also serve , for instance , to test alternative evolutions after recombination .",

    "this pattern of suppresion of even peaks relative to odd ones is sensitive to the value of @xmath90 : the suppression grows with @xmath90.@xcite this pattern of relative suppresion in the heights of even peaks does not occur to the polarization .",
    "this is so because the gravitational infall represented by @xmath32 , which affects the anisotropy , does not change the degree of polarization .",
    "the cmb polarization is proportional to the dipole in the temperature fluctuation at recombination , which in turn , being proportional to a time derivative of the monopole , is proportional to @xmath91 , in the region where @xmath92 , with @xmath80 . since @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then the height of the peaks in the polarization decreases for larger @xmath85 ( any other dependence on @xmath85 in eq .",

    "finally , the contribution to the polarization by smaller scales decays due to silk damping and due to the cancellations produced by the finite width of the last scattering surface .",
    "we have also calculated the polarization correlation function multipoles according to eq .",

    "the main features of this plot are easily understood from the shape of the power spectrum in figure 1 .",
    "the results in figures 1 and 2 are comparable to the numerical results obtained by bond and efstathiou in reference @xcite , more specifically to their figures ( 4b ) and ( 7a ) .",
    "the qualitative structure of peaks is well reproduced .",
    "our quantitative results for the heights and locations of the first peaks are relatively good , but accurate only up to 20 - 30 % .",

    "the quantitative discrepancies in the location of the peaks can be partially attributed to the simplifying approximation made in this section that the photon - baryon sound speed was constant .",
    "this quantity varies by around 15% from the big - bang to the time of decoupling .",
    "neglect of its time - dependence induces an error in our calculation of the phase of the oscillations and thus in the location of the peaks .",
    "besides , we can not expect a good quantitative agreement of the peak heights on scales comparable to the horizon at the time of matter - radiation equality due to our crude approximation for the potential at these wavelenghths",
    ". we can not expect good quantitative agreement for small wavelengths either given the rough approximations we made in this section to average the damping effects .",
    "our analytic approach is not appropriate to obtain accurate quantitative predictions : due to our simplifying approximations we can not expect better than 20 - 30 % accuracy in our estimates of the power spectrum .",
    "the most interesting structure of peaks , however , is well reproduced by our analytic results , and shows that our approach can be reliably used to analyse the physical mechanisms that lead to polarization of the cmb , and their dependence upon cosmological parameters .",
    "we have seen in section ii that the polarization of the cmb is produced during the process of decoupling of matter and radiation , and is proportional to the width of the last scattering surface @xmath62 , and to the value of the dipole in the temperature anisotropy at the time of decoupling , which in turn is determined by the value of the gravitational potential @xmath186 .",
    "the anisotropy in the cmb temperature also depends on these quantities , but differently .",
    "for instance , it is very insensitive on large angular scales to the values of @xmath40 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is the aim of this section to show that because of this different dependence , the ratio between anisotropy and polarization at relatively low multipoles is very sensitive , in an open universe , to the value of the matter density @xmath0 . besides , while the polarization of the cmb is produced during the decoupling transition , the present temperature anisotropy receives contributions not only from the sachs- wolfe effect , which is proportional to @xmath186 , but also from the integrated sachs wolfe effect ( isw ) , due to the time dependence of the gravitational potentials . in an open universe , or in a flat universe with a cosmological constant @xmath187 ,",

    "we shall evaluate the ratio between the multipoles of the temperature fluctuations and of the polarization correlation functions , and investigate its dependence upon @xmath0 for @xmath188 in two special cases : when there is no cosmological constant , and when @xmath189 , with @xmath190 . in both cases",

    "we want to find the explicit dependence of this ratio upon @xmath0 .",
    "the distance to the last scattering surface , @xmath176 , is given by @xmath220 when there is no cosmological constant this reduces to @xmath221 when @xmath222 it can be approximated by @xmath223 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath62 upon @xmath0 can be easily found exploiting the fact that @xmath224 and @xmath225 are approximately independent of @xmath0 and @xmath85@xcite . taking this into account , for @xmath211 we get @xmath226    finally , the function @xmath227 , which can be shown to be function of the combination @xmath228 only , is well approximated by @xmath229    using the above expressions we get for the ratio of multipoles ( [ ratio ] ) @xmath230 \\omega_0^{-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 is a normalization factor , defined so that @xmath232 measures the ratio between the temperature and polarization correlation function multipoles normalized to the value of the same ratio when @xmath2 .",

    "the result is plotted in figure 4 for a fixed value of @xmath85 and @xmath233 .",
    "we have performed an approximate analytic evaluation of the polarization induced in the cmb on a wide range of angular scales by thomson scattering prior to decoupling in the presence of density perturbations with adiabatic initial conditions , in a model with standard recombination .",
    "( [ soldp ] ) gives the polarization induced by one single fourier mode of the density perturbations , down to scales such that @xmath242 . on smaller scales the finite width of the last scattering surface and photon diffusion",

    "the exponential damping factor due to photon diffusion ( silk damping ) , the same for the anisotropy and the polarization , is given by eq .",
    "( [ silkdamp ] ) .",
    "we stress the fact , already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the damping factor in the anisotropy that one would derive neglecting the polarization dependence of thomson scattering would be slightly incorrect : instead of the factor @xmath243 in eq .",
    "( [ silkdamp ] ) one would get a factor @xmath244@xcite . in conclusion",
    ", accurate calculations of the anisotropy on scales where the width of the last scattering surface is relevant should always include the polarization dependence of thomson scattering .",
    "( [ soldp ] ) displays the fact that today s polarization of the cmb was basically produced at the time when the tight coupling which kept the photon distribution isotropic in the electrons rest frame started to break down during recombination .",
    "the degree of polarization is proportional to the quadrupole in the temperature anisotropy around decoupling , which in turn is mainly due to the  free streaming \" of the dipole during the last few scatterings .",
    "this is manifested in eq .",
    "( [ soldp ] ) through the proportionality of the polarization upon the dipole in the temperature anisotropy at decoupling and upon the width of the last scattering surface .",
    "the faster decoupling occurs , smaller the degree of polarization induced in the cmb .",
    "figures 1 and 2 display our results for the cmb polarization power spectrum and correlation function multipoles respectively , for a @xmath2 cdm model with adiabatic , scale - invariant scalar fluctuations normalized to the cobe - dmr measurement of the large angle cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "we have assumed a standard recombination history and that the baryon density was much smaller than the radiation density around decoupling .",
    "the agreement in the height and position of the first peaks with respect to previous numerical computations@xcite is very good .",
    "if the ionization history was as assumed here , with a tight coupling between cmb photons and electrons until last scattering , and no later reionization , then the relative locations of the peaks in the temperature anisotropy and polarization correlation functions are in a simple and definite relation , as we discussed in section ( ii.b ) .",
    "thus , measurement of the relative locations of the peaks in the anisotropy and polarization may give additional clues to the ionization history .",
    "let us also stress again that the relative heights of the peaks in the polarization are less dependent on parameters such as @xmath85 than those of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "indeed , depending on the value of @xmath85 it is possible that the heights of even - numbered peaks of the anisotropy are suppressed with respect to odd ones , due to a partial cancellation between the adiabatic oscillations and the sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "this does not happen to the degree of polarization , since it is not affected by the photons redshift .",
    "the absolute height of the peaks in the polarization , on the other hand , is weakly dependent upon @xmath85 ; they decrease with increasing baryonic density .    at last , but not at least , we have shown that the ratio between anisotropy and polarization multipoles is very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 in an open universe , as evidenced in figure 3 .",
    "this strong dependence upon @xmath0 arises because anisotropy and polarization have a different scale- dependence .",
    "roughly , the polarization induced by a fourier mode scales as @xmath245 with respect to the anisotropy induced by the same mode , on relatively large scales . in an open universe with a scale invariant spectrum of density fluctuations , and just for geometric reasons ,",
    "a change in the spatial curvature significantly changes the relation between the wavenumber @xmath139 of the density fluctuations and the value of the multipole @xmath131 to which that wavenumber contributes the most , significantly changing the value of the ratio between anisotropy and polarization multipoles .",
    "the ratio of anisotropy and polarization multipoles also dependeds upon @xmath0 in an open universe due to the time dependence of the gravitational potentials , which affects anisotropy through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , while it does not affect the polarization .",
