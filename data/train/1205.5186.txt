    "localized electrons jump via phonon - assisted hopping and the transition rates depend exponentially on distance and energy .",
    "the typical hopping distance and energy are functions of the temperature and the mechanism is known as variable - range hopping .",
    "the non - interacting version of this phenomenon was explained forty years ago by mott [ ] . when interactions between electrons are taking into account the problem becomes much more complicated . in the case of coulomb interactions , efros and shklovskii ( es ) proposed an extension of the non - interacting case in which the constant density of states ( dos ) of the non - interacting case is replaced by the dos of the interacting one [ ] .",
    "this dos presents a gap , known as the coulomb gap , around the fermi level [ ] which limits the hopping of electrons at low energies .",
    "the shape of the coulomb gap depends on the dimension of the system @xmath1 and is given by : @xmath2 for @xmath3 . in this formula",
    "the energy @xmath4 is measured with respect to the fermi energy . for @xmath5 there",
    "exist logarithmic corrections to the dos [ ] .",
    "one implicit approximation performed in the es argument is that weak quantum effects do not alter the shape of the dos [ ] .    in this work",
    "we study the effects of a small transfer energy contribution @xmath6 in the shape of the coulomb gap . to generalize the definition of the classical coulomb gap to quantum systems we employ the local dos .",
    "the particle contribution @xmath7 , and the hole contribution @xmath8 to this local dos at site @xmath9 are [ ] : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the eigenenergy and eigenstate of the ground state in the grand canonical ensemble which we assume contains @xmath13 electrons .",

    "we use @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "we notice that @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been defined in such a way that a positive energy is needed to add a particle while a negative one is necessary to subtract a particle . using these particle and hole contributions",

    "this expression reduces to the classical dos when quantum effects are ignored . in the following ,",
    "we refer to @xmath24 just as the dos .",
    "an intuitive argument to describe the changes in the coulomb gap due to quantum effects is given in ref .",
    "[ ] . in the classical case , the restriction on the dos near the fermi level is due to long - range interactions .",
    "if quantum effects only produce a small increase of the localization length , the nature of those long - range interactions should remain the same at scales larger than the localization length and so at energies ( in units of @xmath25 ) smaller than its inverse .",
    "then , one can conclude that the shape of the dos close enough to the fermi energy should not change .",
    "this picture agrees with the experimental results on tunneling conductance [ , ] , although the relation between the dos and the tunneling conductance is not yet fully understood [ ] .",
    "we want to emphasize that this argument does not seem to depend on the dimensionality of the system and the same behavior may be expected for any dimension .",
    "the first attempt made to include quantum effects on the coulomb gap was performed by vignale and coworkers [ ] .",
    "they compute the dos for non - interacting electrons .",
    "but , they chose an on - site energy distribution given by the classical coulomb gap instead of being randomly distributed . using the results obtained for this calculation , they claimed that the coulomb gap is unstable under the inclusion of arbitrarily small quantum effects in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems . in three dimensions",
    ", they found that the gap becomes narrower and quantum effects produce a non - zero density at the fermi level .",
    "after that , vignale [ ] used a hartree - fock based approximation to obtain that the gap narrows for 2d and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems . in ref .  [ ] a coherent potential approximation was employed to conclude that the gap narrows but the dos at the fermi energy remains negligibly small when weak quantum effects are considered in two and three dimensions .",
    "schreiber et al .",
    "[ ] studied the 3d case within a hartree - fock based method .",
    "their results show that weak quantum effects narrow the gap and are compatible with a zero dos at the fermi energy .",
    "the narrowing of the gap with a finite @xmath6 seems to be the natural tendency at least in 3d systems , since the gap must be logarithmically small in the extended phase [ ] .",
    "however , jeon et al .",
    "[ ] applied the same method to one - dimensional ( 1d ) and 2d systems and their results show that the slope of the classical gap near the fermi level decreases upon including weak quantum effects .",
    "this is in contradiction with previous results [ , , ] in two dimensions .",
    "we note the lack of agreement on whether weak quantum effects widen or narrow the coulomb gap and on whether they produce or not a finite dos at the fermi level .",
    "neither is clear if quantum corrections depend on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "we study the dos given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dt ] ) for systems composed by many electrons when disorder and long - range interactions are important but quantum effects are weak . our main goal is to study 2d systems with coulomb interactions , but we also analyze 1d systems with a @xmath26 interaction . this interaction produces a linear gap in the classical dos of 1d systems , the same as the coulomb interaction in the 2d case .",
    "this linear gap is easier to analyze numerically than the logarithmic gap produced by a coulomb interaction in one dimension .",
    "furthermore , we will see that our results for 1d systems show the same tendency that the ones found in ref .",
    "[ ] for coulomb interactions .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section  [ section:2",
    "] , we introduce the model and the basic numerical tools which shall be used .",
    "after that , in section   [ section:3 ] , we present results obtained with exact diagonalization . in section  [ section:4 ] , a perturbative analysis of the dos is performed and the results of this analysis are used to compute the dos for much larger system sizes than those obtained by exact diagonalization .",
    "finally , our results are briefly summarized and discussed in section  [ section:5 ] .",
    "we study a spin - less fermionic system in a regular lattice with long - range interactions in which translational symmetry is broken by an on - site random potential and particles can tunnel to nearest neighbors sites .",

    "that is , @xmath33 is used in 1d and @xmath34 for 2d systems . in our computations",
    "we implement periodic boundary conditions in all the directions and the interaction between two sites is set by the minimum - image convention .",
    "we take an interaction energy @xmath35 , which fixes the energy scale , and we consider a disorder energy @xmath36 .",
    "we are mainly interested in a regime where the localization length is small compared with the system size , but non zero .",
    "we use a compensation constant @xmath32 and chemical potential @xmath31 depending on the filling to ensure the neutrality of the system .",
    "most of our work has been performed at half filling for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for this value of @xmath32",
    "the dos is symmetric with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "we shall take advantage of this property to only show half of the dos when presenting results .",
    "we also compute in section  [ section:4 ] the dos at one third filling . in this case , we set @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we analyze the two alternative approaches employed to obtain the dos , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) and ( [ eq : dh ] ) . the first one is based on exact diagonalization .",
    "the largest system sizes considered with this method are @xmath41 for one dimension and @xmath42 for two . in order to compute the dos via exact diagonalization",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we search for the ground state in the grand canonical ensemble which we assume contains @xmath13 particles . as we will discuss later ,",
    "this ensemble minimizes finite size effects .",
    "we are interested in an energy region close enough to the fermi level , so we only calculate the @xmath43 smallest energy levels for the cases corresponding to @xmath44 and @xmath18 particles , with @xmath45 .",
    "such a partial diagonalization is carried out using arpack open library [ ] which are based on a variant of the lanczos algorithm and allows to efficiently obtain a few eigenvectors and its eigenenergies . in ref .",
    "[ ] , we provide a thorough study of the validity of the method depending on the number of eigenstates considered .",
    "we run this procedure for at least 3000 realizations of disorder to obtain an average of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) and ( [ eq : dh ] ) .",
    "finally , by working in the grand canonical ensemble and choosing the minimum energy eigenstate for all the occupations , we ensure that the electron energies are always positive ( hole energies negative ) and this avoids an artificial filling of the dos at the fermi energy .",
    "an analogous problem in the classical limit is discussed in ref .",
    "in the second approach we use a numerical algorithm to obtain the classical ground state , i.e. the lowest energy configuration of the @xmath46 limit and a fairly complete set of low - energy configurations , needed to recalculate the new ground state in the presence of quantum effects as will be explained in section [ section:4 ] . to compute these classical states , we repeatedly start from states chosen at random and relax each sample using a local search procedure [ ] . in an iterative process , we look for configurations of lower energies differing by one - electron or compact two - electron jumps and always accept the first of such states found .",
    "the procedure stops when no lower energy neighboring states exist , which insures stability with respect to all one - electron jumps and compact two - electron jumps .",
    "we then consider the set of metastable states found by the process just described and look for the sites which present the same occupation in all of them .",
    "these sites are assumed to be frozen , i.e. they are not allowed to change occupation , and the relaxation algorithm is now applied to the unfrozen sites .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated until no new frozen sites are found with the set of metastable states considered .",
    "the lowest energy configuration of the set of metastable states is consider to be the classical ground state .",
    "the set of low - energy states is completed by generating all the configurations that differ by one or two electrons transitions from any of the metastable configuration state found before .",
    "and the sizes are specified in each panel . ]    as the sizes involved in the exact diagonalization are small , let us start with a finite size analysis to check that valid conclusions still can be drawn . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the dos for hopping parameter @xmath47 in one ( left ) and two dimensions ( right ) .",
    "the sizes employed are @xmath48 in one dimension and @xmath49 in two dimensions .",
    "the symmetry of the dos with respect to the fermi energy at half occupation is taken into account and only half of the dos is represented . in the classical case ,",
    "finite size effects produces a filling of the dos at the fermi energy depending on the linear size of the system @xmath50 as @xmath51 for both 1d and 2d systems [ ] . as in this classical case , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] indicates that finite size effects for small hopping are important for energies close to the fermi level .",
    "but they are not so important at intermediate energies inside the coulomb gap .",
    "indeed , we can observe in both panels appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that there is a region around the middle of each branch of the gap where the changes in the dos are small for the sizes considered .",
    "we take advantage of this fact to extract information about the behavior of an intermediate region of the gap when hopping is small but non - zero .     in 1d ( left ) and",
    "@xmath52 in 2d ( right ) systems for several values of hopping as indicated in each panel .",
    "the thin black lines represent much larger sizes for the classical case and are shown as references . ]",
    "we study now the dependence of the dos on the hopping parameter . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the dos as a function of energy is shown for several values of the hopping parameter for a 1d system of size @xmath53 . from top to bottom , the different lines correspond to @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the thin line is the classical dos for a size @xmath55 and it is included only as a reference .",
    "we can see that the gap in the dos corresponding to an intermediate region widens for finite values of the hopping parameter .",
    "this is a surprising behavior according to the intuitive picture explained in the introduction , but it is similar to the results found in reference [ ] for 1d systems .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the shape of the gap remains pretty much linear for the values of @xmath6 shown . near the fermi level",
    "the gap is not linear , but one can ascribe this to finite size effects .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the dos as a function of energy for @xmath54 in the 2d case for size @xmath56 .",
    "the thin black line corresponds to the classical dos for a size @xmath57 and it is included as a reference .",
    "similarly to the 1d case , we can observe that the gap in the dos widens at an intermediate energy region as @xmath6 increases up to @xmath47 , though the changes are smaller than in the 1d problem .",
    "we stress that the tendency for @xmath58 seems to be the opposite that the one for smaller hopping .",
    "that is , the dos at @xmath58 seems to narrow respect the dos at @xmath47 .",
    "these results are again compatible with reference [ ] but in contradiction with all the other previous works treating the 2d case [ , , ] .",
    "our direct diagonalization method was constrained to small systems . in this section",
    ", we develop a novel approach based on perturbation of the hopping parameter which will allow us to calculate the dos for larger sizes and obtain reliable data for the dos at fermi level .",
    "usually , perturbation theory is difficult to apply to the kind of interacting system we are treating . in fact , a small perturbation of a hopping term between two given sites affects particles which are arbitrarily far away of those sites due to the long - range character of the interaction .",
    "then , the perturbative analysis must be performed over the full many - body space instead of the one - particle states .",
    "we have overcome these difficulties for small enough @xmath6 by only considering the most relevant hopping terms when computing the local dos at a given site @xmath9 .    in the classical case , @xmath46 , all the eigenstates have a well defined occupation in each site . as a consequence ,",
    "there are well defined energies associated with each site of the lattice . to be more precise , the energy of site @xmath9 is defined as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the occupation of site @xmath9 , @xmath11 the energy of the ground state and @xmath61 are the energies of the eigenstates with a particle or hole respectively created at site @xmath9 to the ground state .",
    "the dos for a classical system is just the density of these site energies .",
    "when quantum effects are introduced , this picture can be significantly altered .",
    "indeed , the eigenstate of the hamiltonian for non - zero hopping do not have a well defined occupation in each site and , in general , it is not possible to define a site energy . nevertheless , we will see that a picture similar to the classical case still holds when the localization length is small enough .",

    "an electron can hop at most to a nearest neighbor site . roughly speaking ,",
    "an electron hopping from site @xmath66 to @xmath67 changes the classical energy of the site @xmath9 as a dipolar contribution when @xmath68 is large enough .",
    "then , the changes in the classical energy at site @xmath9 due to the hopping between sites @xmath69 should fall off faster than @xmath70 .",

    "indeed , the matrix element @xmath76 is non - zero only if the eigenstate @xmath14 corresponds to a state with an electron added at site @xmath9 on top of the ground state .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we can appreciate that the dos near this fermi level does not seem to be affected by a small hopping in 1d neither in 2d systems .",

    ", we can appreciate in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] that the dos widens for a intermediate energy region as it was also found using exact diagonalization .",

    "we have checked that the same result holds in 2d .",

    "our numerical results indicate that weak quantum effects produce a widening of the coulomb gap in the dos .",
    "this widening is due to level repulsion . in the ground state , when two nearest - neighbor sites have opposite occupancy , the hopping term mixes two configurations : @xmath103 $ ] and @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "due to level repulsion the difference in energy must be larger than @xmath6 . the energy of the ground state is always reduced by quantum corrections , while configurations with one more or one less particle are not affected ( up to @xmath105 ) . this effect contributes to open the gap , as occupied sites will reduce its energy while empty ones will increase it .",
    "if two nearest sites are both empty in the ground state @xmath106 $ ] , quantum corrections will affect only configurations with one more particle .",
    "indeed , the site with lowest site energy will reduce it ( due to level repulsion ) and the other one will increase it .",
    "so , for an empty site near the center of the gap this second effect will produce , on average , a reduction of the site energy ( the gap closes ) as the chances are that the empty neighbor will have larger site energy . for 1d and 2d",
    "we expect this second effect to be much smaller than the first one because the probability of finding two empty sites with site energies within the gap and difference smaller than @xmath6 is very small .",
    "the first effect does not require that both site energies should be inside the gap , so it should be more likely . in 3d systems , as the gap is parabolic , this second mechanism is more effective , so we expect the widening of the gap to be much smaller .",
    "the previous arguments are not rigorous as quantum effects , for a finite @xmath6 , could change the configuration of the ground state .",
    "more properly we should use a self - consistent approximation taking into account the quantum corrections .",
    "the net effect of this quantum corrections is the hardening of the constraints for the ground state .",
    "in particular an occupied site with energy @xmath107 and a nearest neighbor empty site with energy @xmath108 must satisfy the condition @xmath109    we may notice that the widening of the coulomb gap with transfer energy @xmath6 , specially on low dimensional systems , should be taken into account in the interpretation of tunneling experiments in the strongly localized regime [ , ] .",
    "it may also affect variable range hopping conductance . a calculation based on the classical dos [ , ] will overestimate the conductance , since the widening of the gap will not be taken into account .    in summary",
    ", we have studied quantum effects in the dos of strongly localized regime with a @xmath0 interaction in one dimension and a coulomb interaction in two dimensions .",
    "two different numerical methods have been employed .",

    "we have obtained that the dos in one and two dimensions remains approximately linear for small but non - zero hopping . for 1d systems ,",

    "the coulomb gap also widens when the hopping is increased from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , but this tendency is reversed from there on . using a novel perturbation approach , we have been able to compute the dos for much larger system sizes than for exact diagonalization using hopping @xmath92 .",
    "the results confirm that the slope of the coulomb gap decreases when including weak quantum effects and that there is not an appreciable filling of the coulomb gap at the fermi energy .",
    "finally , we have computed the dos at @xmath110 filling for 1d systems .",
    "our result indicates that the behavior of the dos near the fermi energy is independent of the degree of filling .",
