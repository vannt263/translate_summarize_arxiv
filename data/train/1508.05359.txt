    "limitations of the experimental protocol make recording more data in this interval challenging .",
    "nonetheless , this new observation suggests that more accurate estimates of @xmath70 may be found by restricting simulation and data fitting to the early part of the experiment .",

    "@xmath105 finally , by summing only those squares of coefficients corresponding to frequencies which are multiples of the @xmath106 s , the variance due to the changes in a particular rate constant can be discerned .",
    "this motivates the computation of a _ sensitivity index _ , which is the ratio of the variance due to one parameter to the total variance .",

    "the selection of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and a finite set of @xmath100 values to accurately approximate the integrals   are subtle issues addressed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for any time point of interest , the sensitivity indices determine which portion of the variance can be attributed to each parameter . by repeating the analysis for different times , global sensitivity indices may be plotted in a manor similar to the relative local sensitivities of figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] .",
