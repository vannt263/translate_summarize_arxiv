    "yet , for the most part , these galaxies are too faint for efficient high - resolution spectra and too small to be fully resolved @xcite .",
    "thus , observations have , so far , revealed little about their interstellar media ( ism ) .    in the absence of such data",
    ", it is often assumed that @xmath0 lbgs are physically similar to the lower - redshift starbursts that have also been found with the lyman - break technique .",
    "the fact that few @xmath8 lbgs host agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is often pointed to as evidence that few @xmath9 galaxies should contain supermassive bhs as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indeed , studies of x - ray heating in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have cited the low - redshift agn lf to argue that agn are not necessary for cosmic reionization and that high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) provide the only significant sources of x - rays .",
    "these studies are limited by data that may be missing faint agn in @xmath10 galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "a general theoretical picture of galaxy physics is emerging where galactic accretion is balanced by star formation , winds , and angular momentum transport in marginally toomre - unstable disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in which gas inflow toward the center of the galactic center is a generic prediction @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent analysis of _ chandra _ observations has begun to place limits on the x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 lbgs using a stacking method @xcite .",
    "while the results of different studies have been inconsistent , the conclusions by @xcite may reflect evidence of ongoing and highly obscured black hole growth in faint agn at the centers of these high - redshift lbgs .",
    "however , predictions for such x - ray observations based on the new paradigms of galaxy formation are absent in the literature . with a view toward resolving this shortfall ,",
    "we start from the radiation pressure - balanced ism model of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter tqm05 ) that was shown to describe massive star - forming galaxies and agn at @xmath8 and extend it to even higher redshift by assuming a dust - free ism and applying the appropriate velocity dispersions and metallicities .",
    "we improve the treatment by considering both the self - gravity of the disk and the ejection of material through winds and show how the uv mass - to - light ratio and the x - ray luminosity are signatures of and place constraints on the galaxy fueling rate , wind properties , and angular momentum transport mechanism .    in  [ sec : model :",
    "acc_disk : model ] , we outline the components of our ism model showing explicitly how it differs from previous studies and implementations and clearly laying out the free parameters . after constraining the wind mass - loading parameter to reproduce observations of the uv lf at @xmath0 in  [ sec : uvlf ] ,",
    "we explore the effects of different angular momentum transport models on the central black hole accretion rate in  [ sec : bhacc ] and on the resulting agn luminosity and its obscuration by the dense gas in  [ sec : agn ] .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] where we specifically consider the x - ray emission of high - redshift lbgs , comparing our model agn outputs with expectations from hmxbs and the recent _ chandra _ observations .",
    "finally , we conclude with a review and discussion of our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this subsection , we summarize the basic components of the model discussed in the rest of  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model ] with fiducial values and free parameters .",
    "we formulate this model with the goal of representing @xmath0 lbgs in mind . at lower redshift , it reduces roughly to the model that tqm05 showed accurately describes luminous agn and starbursts at @xmath8 . here",
    "we also point out where our formulation differs from that in previous studies .",
    "we start with the basic model of tqm05 with a galactic disk that connects smoothly to an agn accretion disk around a central bh .",
    "we note that , while the disks need not be thin , this picture assumes that high - redsift galaxies are not spherically amorphous .",
    "the size and velocity dispersion of the galactic disk are specified by the mass and redshift of the host dark matter halo . as described in ",
    "[ sec : model : acc_disk : model : disk ] , gas is accreted onto the outer edge and , at each radius , may either be turned into stars , ejected by winds , or transported toward smaller radii .",
    "given their focus on larger galaxies , tqm05 ignored the loss of gas via winds .",
    "however , we include a momentum - driven outflow at each radius with a mass loss rate proportional to the ratio of sfr to velocity dispersion and normalized by the free parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the timescale for the buildup of the disk is long enough that the reservoir of existing gas need not be included either as contributing to star formation or as a sink for accreting gas .",
    "ultimately , the fraction of gas not incorporated into stars or ejected by winds is accreted onto the bh .",
    "the rate of baryonic accretion onto the galaxy (  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : acc_global ] ) and the mechanism for gas transport through the disk (  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : acc_disk ] ) are key elements of the model .",
    "we assume that the cold - flow model  in which infalling cold gas is not shocked at the virial radius but streams freely to the galaxy  gives the most reasonable description of the galactic fueling rate in @xmath0 lbgs and is completely specified by halo mass and redshift .",
    "moreover , we consider three possible mechanisms for the transport of gas through the disk : ( i ) an @xmath4-disk model with a viscosity parameterized by a constant value @xmath4 ; ( ii ) a gravitational torque - generated infall model induced by a linear spiral wave and characterized by an infall velocity that reaches a constant fraction , @xmath12 , of the local sound speed ; and ( iii ) a shocked infall model induced by orbit crossings of spiral waves in which the infall velocity is a fixed fraction , @xmath13 , of the orbital velocity .",
    "this last process was not considered by tqm05 but has been seen in numerical simulations and developed analytically @xcite . in each case , we take fiducial values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 .    given the global accretion rate , an angular momentum transport mechanism , and a wind parameter @xmath11 , we can calculate the density and temperature profiles as well as the star formation and infall rates as a function of radius in the disk by solving the equation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium (  [ sec : model : pbal ] ) , in which radiation pressure from stars dominates thermal pressure from supernovae and maintains marginal toomre - stability .",
    "while we consider the effect of additional turbulent support , either from dense clumps in cold streams @xcite or disk instabilities @xcite , we ultimately ignore both when compared with pressure from stars (  [ sec : model : turb ] ) .",
    "deviating from the tqm05 model , we include the self - gravity of the disk in the pressure balance and assume a dust - free ism , taking as negligible additional support from pressure on dust grains (  [ sec : model : dust ] ) .",
    "the tqm05 model assumes a galactic disk that extends toward small radii and matches onto the accretion disk around a central bh .",
    "this system is embedded in an isothermal halo with velocity dispersion @xmath3 so that the angular rotation speed of the disk as a function of radius is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the bh . given the paucity of high - redshift data and the uncertainty in extrapolating the local @xmath2-@xmath3 relation to early times",
    ", we simply assume the local empirical relation @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xcite and substitute the total halo velocity dispersion for the bulge dispersion .",
    "for a @xmath21 halo at @xmath1 , where @xmath22 , the extra contribution to the rotational velocity from the bh is significant only within the central parsec ; throughout most of the disk , @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that gas in the galactic disk is optically thick to the ionizing uv radiation emitted by stars so that radiation pressure maintains vertical hydrostatic equilibrium against gravity . in the outer regions where pressure from stars dominates",
    ", the disk is constrained to be marginally toomre - stable @xcite with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total sound speed in the disk , @xmath26 is the gas surface density , @xmath27 is the gas density in the plane , and the disk scale height is @xmath28 .",
    "thermal gas pressure and radiation from the agn are allowed to stabilize the inner disk to @xmath29 .",
    "we review this pressure equilibrium in  [ sec : model : pbal ] , but we refer the reader to tqm05 for more details .",
    "the model implicitly assumes that the timescale for building up the reservoir of gas in the disk is much longer than any of the disk crossing timescale , the star formation timescale , or the advection timescale .",
    "thus , none of the gas accreting onto the disk goes toward increasing the gas mass of the disk . for momentum - driven winds ,",
    "this is true for galaxies hosted in halos less massive than @xmath30 out to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "instead , accreted gas can be turned into stars or expelled by winds , as considered by @xcite , but a small fraction may also be accreted onto the central bh and power an agn .",
    "this conservation is also true on a local level as gas is transported through the disk , so that the inflow rate at each radius is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the galactic accretion rate of baryons onto the outer edge of the disk at a radius of @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the surface density of star formation , and @xmath36 is the wind mass - loading parameter .",
    "we take @xmath34 to be a fixed fraction @xmath37 of the halo virial radius , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 @xcite , consistent with the highest - resolution observations available @xcite . while tqm05 ignored the reduction in gas accretion rate through outflows",
    ", we include the effect of a momentum - driven wind @xcite with @xmath40 where @xmath11 is a free parameter to which we will return in  [ sec : uvlf ] and @xmath41 is the efficiency with which stars process matter into radiation . in principle",
    ", @xmath41 depends on the imf and metallicity of the stars in the galaxy with an efficiency of @xmath42 for a salpeter imf from 1100@xmath43 at solar metallicity .",
    "however , using starburst99 @xcite , we have checked that @xmath41 differs from @xmath44 by only a factor of order unity even for a pop iii imf at very low metallicities .",
    "thus , we will assume @xmath45 throughout the rest of this",
    "_ paper_.since only ionizing radiation from stars impacts the dust - free ism in our model , the value of @xmath41 may be correspondingly reduced .",
    "however , because of the degeneracy between @xmath41 and @xmath11 in equation [ eq : eta_wind ] , this ultimately has no effect on @xmath46 itself ( see footnote [ foot : epsilon2 ] ) . ] given this efficiency , if the asymptotic wind velocity at infinity is @xmath47 @xcite , the critical velocity below which winds reduce the gas accretion rate more than star formation itself is @xmath48 , implying that most high - redshift galaxies are strongly affected by winds .",
    "on the other hand , the semi - analytic models of @xcite and @xcite postulate that lbgs at @xmath0 are the products of mergers , which are probably not well - represented by the steady - state model we have assumed in equations [ eq : omk ] and [ eq : mdot1 ] . at @xmath1 , the halo merger time of @xmath21 halos is on the order of the hubble time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the small sizes and high densities of early galaxies may suppress merger - generated effects @xcite . given the complexities of such a model , we leave a detailed analysis of this scenario to future work .",
    "the galactic accretion rate of baryons onto the disk , @xmath33 , is a key component of equation [ eq : mdot1 ] since it limits the amount of possible star formation , winds , and agn activity .",
    "by contrast , @xcite proposes a star formation efficiency set by the properties of molecular clouds .",
    "this picture can be reconciled with our model if the molecular gas fraction is simply set by the sfr required to maintain @xmath49 @xcite . in  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : acc_global ] , we consider the galactic accretion rate due to cold flows .",
    "the transport of the gas through the disk is also a critical component of the model since the transport rate determines whether gas will form stars and expel winds ( i.e. , if the rate is slow ) or be accreted onto a luminous agn ( i.e. , if the gas accretes quickly through the disk so that the advection timescale is shorter than the star formation timescale ) .",
    " [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : acc_disk ] considers three different mechanisms for the transport of angular momentum and gas through the disk and their implications .",
    "the accretion rate of baryons onto the disk is an important parameter in our model because it sets the amount of gas available for star formation and agn fueling . as we will see in  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : acc_disk ] , the accretion rate also determines the scale height required to channel such a mass flow rate through the disk at a certain velocity .    in the cold flow model ,",
    "baryons stream directly onto the galactic disk and are not slowed by an accretion shock @xcite .",
    "thus , the accretion rate roughly traces the buildup of dark matter in the halo .",
    "several studies have investigated fitting formulae for the average accretion rate as a function of only halo mass , @xmath50 , and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while all of these studies were focused on results at @xmath8 , we assume that the same redshift dependence holds out to @xmath10 and gives a reasonable approximation of the baryonic accretion rate at these redshifts . following the work by @xcite ,",
    "the average baryon accretion rate in cold flows at high redshift is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "we note that this prescription would be significantly altered in a merger scenario , where gas may be dumped onto galaxies at much higher rates for short periods of time and at chaotic intervals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rate at which gas is transported toward the center of the disk determines how much is consumed by star formation and how much fuels the agn .",
    "we consider three different mechanisms that may operate in the disks of high - redshift galaxies : a simple @xmath4-disk model , infall mediated by linear spiral waves , and non - linear shocked infall due to orbit crossings . in each case , the mass infall rate as a function of radius is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the infall velocity of the gas as a function of radius .",
    "with @xmath27 determined by equation [ eq : q ] , the mechanism that sets @xmath54 also indirectly determines the disk scale height required maintain mass conservation while channeling a given @xmath55 through the disk .      in an @xmath4-disk ,",
    "the viscosity funneling gas into the center of the disk is a local process given by @xmath56 and described by the parameter @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "following twm05 , the infall velocity is @xmath57 unless otherwise noted , we take a fiducial value of @xmath14",
    ". however , the inflow can achieve even lower values of @xmath4 in certain regimes @xcite .",
    "since a smaller @xmath4 would only reduce the already miniscule bh accretion rates we find for locally viscous disks ( see  [ sec : bhacc ] ) , we consider only the higher value here . for a thin disk , the infall velocity of an @xmath4-disk is much less than the sound speed .      since a local mechanism for",
    "viscosity may have trouble fueling the central bhs of luminous agn , tqm05 further consider a global - torque model in which the infall velocity reaches a fixed fraction of the sound speed ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath58 where @xmath12 is the mach number .",
    "this type of angular momentum transport is produced by gravitational torques due to linear spiral waves ( lsws ) in pure gas disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "following @xcite and tqm05 , we assume a fiducial value of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the infall velocity in this model is a significant fraction of the sound speed , even for a thin disk .",
    "as we will see , this allows more gas to accrete onto the bh than in the @xmath4-disk case .",
    "two additional effects will lead to increased angular momentum transport and gas infall in galactic disks .",
    "first , in disks with both gas and stars , wave modes in each component will be offset by @xmath59 due to dissipation in the collisional gas @xcite .",
    "the resulting gravitational torque of the stars on the gas drives gas toward the center .",
    "however this effect is strongly suppressed in systems where the disk does not dominate the potential @xcite .",
    "additionally , nonlinear wave modes in the gas lead to orbit crossings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , orbit trapping ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , and ultimately shocked dissipation and infall .",
    "both of these processes lead to mass infall rates that are independent of the local sound speed and , thus , of the local thermodynamics of the disk @xcite .",
    "in general , @xmath60 where @xmath13 is a constant . because we assumed in  [ sec : model : acc_disk : model : disk ] that the disk is a subdominant component of the potential in @xmath0 galaxies , we do not expect a stellar disk to provide a significant torque on the gas .",
    "therefore , we will refer to the angular momentum transport mechanism of equation [ eq : vin_s ] as resulting from  shocked infall . \" on the other hand , the formation of disks at the highest redshifts is an open problem .",
    "numerical simulations with significant inflow that include both effects find typical values of @xmath61@xmath62 @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we nominally assume @xmath16 and consider results for a range of values where appropriate .",
    "we assume that hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained vertically in the disk . for a thin disk ,",
    "the pressure required to balance gravity can be approximated as : @xmath63 where the first term on the right - hand - side is the contribution from the self - gravity of the disk and the second is due to the isothermal halo potential .",
    "we show that , for constant @xmath64 , equation [ eq : pgrav ] can also be expressed as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a constant .",
    "while tqm05 assumes @xmath67 for simplicity , essentially ignoring the disk self - gravity term , we show that the contribution of this term is indeed significant . since @xmath68 , then @xmath69 . substituting into equation",
    "[ eq : q ] with @xmath26 and solving for the density gives @xmath70 which is different from the tqm05 derivation by the factor of @xmath71 .",
    "substituting back into equation [ eq : pgrav ] yields @xmath72 from which we find ( for @xmath73 ) @xmath74 .",
    "while such a large value of @xmath66 implies that the disk self - gravity is an important component of @xmath75 , this is only because the gravitational pull of the halo contributes only its small vertical component . the potential and total gravitational force throughout most of the disk is still dominated by the isothermal halo as in equation [ eq : omk ] .",
    "gravity in the disk is balanced by radiation pressure from stars and the thermal pressure of the gas .",
    "tqm05 considered the influence of radiation on grains within a coupled dust - gas medium .",
    "however , in the dust - free ism that we assume for @xmath10 lbgs , uv photons impart momentum directly to the gas through ionizations . in this case , the gas surface densities required for optical thickness are extremely small ( @xmath76 ) . for an ionizing escape fraction @xmath77 ,",
    "the resulting pressure is of the same order as that in the single - scattering case of a dusty medium , where the dust is optically thick to uv radiation but optically thin to the re - radiated ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and given by : @xmath78 note that we have , additionally , assumed no cancelation of oppositely - directed momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) in equation  [ eq : pstars ] .",
    "tqm05 showed that the contribution to the pressure from a hot ism phase in supernova bubbles is negligible because of the high density of luminous starbursts .",
    "however , the mechanical deposition of energy from gas swept into shells by supernova shocks provides pressure support of the same order as @xmath79 .",
    "the same argument holds true in the comparably high densities of the early galaxies we consider here .",
    "thus , we set the total pressure from stars to be @xmath80 and have checked that this assumption provides nearly identical results as explicitly including mechanical pressure support from supernovae . because contraction of the disk leads to an increase in star formation",
    "while expansion leads to a decrease , pressure due to star formation is a self - regulating process even in annuli where the sfr is very small and discreteness effects become important . ]",
    "that maintains @xmath81 in the disk .    while the disk is dense enough on average to gain momentum from every ionizing photon produced , winds or the agn may create holes in the gas distribution through which radiation can leak and increase @xmath82 . in this case , stabilizing the disk will require additional star formation and result in less gas available for accretion into the central agn",
    "however , we would expect the resulting leakage to have only a small effect on the mechanical pressure supplied by supernovae .",
    "therefore , holes should not change @xmath83 by more than a factor of two .",
    "the same argument can be applied to using more precise values of @xmath41 for pressure generated exclusively by ionizing radiation .    thermal gas pressure",
    ", @xmath84 also provides support against gravity according to its density and temperature . here",
    ", @xmath85 is the proton mass , and , in the star - forming region of the disk @xmath86 so that the mid - plane temperature , @xmath87 , is approximately the effective temperature of the radiation . , where @xmath88 is the ir optical depth .",
    "additionally , a lower value of @xmath41 would not significantly affect the gas temperature because the corresponding reduction in pressure would be raised to the @xmath89 power .",
    "] we also ignore the effect of cmb heating on the gas .",
    "the cmb temperature at @xmath1 is about @xmath90 , which can be higher than our modeled gas temperature at some radii and in some regions of parameter space .",
    "however , the compton heating time for the cmb is long , and formally , there are no metal lines through which it can interact with the gas in our dust - free model .",
    "still , the cmb may have an important effect on the temperature of high - redshift molecular clouds and certainly on our ability to observe radio lines from these objects @xcite .",
    "vertical hydrostatic equilibrium implies @xmath91 as in the tqm05 treatment , once @xmath92 comes to dominate , star formation is no longer required to support the disk and becomes negligible . as gas accretes to even lower radii , it loses the gravitational energy that powers the agn .",
    "however , since star formation can no longer deplete the supply of gas to the central bh , we ignore the question of how and whether this extra energy heats or supports the disk .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider turbulent pressure support due to the impact of dense clumps in a cold flow on the disk @xcite or instabilities within the disk @xcite , which have been postulated to be the dominant mechanisms maintaining @xmath73 .    since the angular momentum of cold flows",
    "is thought to be responsible for the buildup of rotating disks @xcite , we assume that dense clumps within the streams impact and deposit their kinetic energy as turbulence into the disk at its edge .",
    "this turbulence is transported inward over the advection timescale @xmath93 but decays over the disk crossing time @xmath94 . for an lsw model of gas transport",
    "[ eq : vin_m ] ) , the decay time is a fraction @xmath95 of the advection time and even smaller in an @xmath4-disk model . in a shocked infall model",
    ", this ratio is @xmath96 .",
    "thus , for a thin disk , @xmath97 , or @xmath98 , cold clump turbulence decays quickly and does not affect the disk beyond its outermost rim .",
    "a related source of turbulent disk support may come from the energy released by the gas as it spirals inward through the disk and down the potential gradient .",
    "if all of this energy is quickly radiated , then pressure of this magnitude is sub - dominant compared to stars , except very close to the galactic center .",
    "otherwise , if the turbulence remains un - thermalized , it may dominate and stabilize the disk as several studies that ignore pressure from stars claim in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "formally , this pressure may suppress all star formation in our model , but such an occurrence depends sensitively on , e.g. , the details of the turbulent dissipation .",
    "however , dominant instability - driven turbulence is in tension with other works that show star formation as participating directly in disk support and being regulated by the amount of cold inflow into the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our goal is not to definitively settle this question , which must be left for numerical simulations , but since our work implicitly assumes the latter theoretical framework , we here ignore the contribution of lost gravitational energy to the turbulent support of the disk .",
    "finally , we note that additional turbulence in a major merger scenario  not considered here  may maintain @xmath29 and allow gas to bypass star formation and funnel rapidly into a central , bright agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our treatment has assumed that the ism of @xmath10 galaxies are dust - free ) . ] .",

    "whether momentum is supplied to the gas directly from ionizing radiation or via uv incident on dust grains , the resulting radiation pressure will not be significantly different from that given in equation [ eq : pstars ] as long as the dust is optically thin to the re - radiated ir .",
    "in luminous agn and starbursts , this reprocessed radiation can provide additional pressure support for maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium ( * ? ? ? *",
    "tqm05 ) , increasing @xmath79 by a factor of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the optical depth of dust to ir radiation and @xmath102 is the rosseland mean opacity in the optically thick limit .",

    "our dust - free approximation is further justified by the small velocity dispersions and infall rates of interest . for angular momentum transport mediated by lsws , combining equations [ eq : mdot2 ] and [ eq : vin_m ] yields @xmath103 assuming the simple , low - temperature opacity model used by tqm05 where @xmath104 , with dust temperature @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the resulting optical depth is @xmath107 while the luminous starbursts and agn considered by tqm05 have @xmath108 and @xmath109 at the edge of the disk , @xmath1 lbgs are significantly smaller systems with @xmath22 and a cold - flow accretion rate of @xmath110 .",

    "we then used the uv lf analysis of @xcite and @xcite to calculate the the distribution of halo masses appropriate for @xmath10 lbgs and calibrate the wind mass - loading factor . _",
    "a cold - flow accretion rate can readily reproduce the observations with @xmath216 _ , consistent with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , where appropriate , we also explored the effect of assuming @xmath145 where consistency with the uv lf is restored by a somewhat larger amount of dust extinction than currently indicated by uv continuum slope measurements @xcite . for @xmath21 halos at @xmath1 ,",
    "these two values of @xmath11 correspond to mass - loading factors of @xmath149 and 2 , respectively . while we do not investigate in detail a scenario in which major mergers are responsible for @xmath0 lbgs",
    ", we expect that such a mechanism would generate an unaccountably high star formation or bh accretion rate when compared with observations .",
    "a competition between the speed at which gas is transported toward the center of the disk and the rate at which it is transformed into stars or ejected by winds determines how much gas remains to be accreted onto the central bh .",
    "therefore , the distribution of star formation throughout the disk , the bh growth rate , and the resulting agn luminosity critically depend on the angular momentum transport mechanism in the disk .",
    "we compared the effect of three simple models : a local viscosity @xmath4-disk , infall mediated by a linear spiral wave ( lsw ) , and nonlinear , shocked infall from orbit - crossings .",
    "we found that , while @xmath4-disks can not account for a growth rate high enough to form a black hole commensurate with our assumed @xmath2-@xmath3 relation , _ either an lsw model with @xmath15 and @xmath137 or a shocked infall model with @xmath217 can build the correct size black hole by @xmath9 with a duty cycle of unity _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : agnm ] ) .",
    "we suggest that local , @xmath4-disk models and globally - operating , gravitational torque models ( such as lsw and shocked infall ) may represent distinct growth modes for bhs in high - redshift lbgs .",
    "further investigation is required to determine whether the rapid angular momentum transport mediated by dense clumps and disk instabilities @xcite can , in a full cosmological context , either stabilize or oscillate into a slower accretion mode dominated by local viscosity .    given the dearth of @xmath10 agn , we calculated the x - ray bolometric correction by extrapolating from low - redshift observations .",
    "however , the development of future samples will allow us to improve this procedure . while the x - ray emission generated in @xmath4-disk models",
    "is negligible due to minuscule bh accretion rates , _ agn in both the lsw and shocked infall models generate more x - ray luminosity than do hmxms_. this is particularly true of shocked infall models for all reasonable input parameters ( the exception being for @xmath210 ) , while an unusually high value of @xmath205 could allow hmxbs to compete with agn in lsw models .",
    "however , we also note that differences in the ways the agn and the star - forming disk are obscured may complicate this comparison .",
    "future work , moreover , will show how this radiation feeds back into the igm to modulate reionization .    in considering the observable x - rays generated by our models , we considered two cases : unobscured emission  in which the emission is all produced at a radius of order the inner edge of the accretion disk and the disk is viewed face - on  and highly obscured emission  where x - ray production is distributed throughout the mid - plane of the accretion disk and radiation is spectrally - filtered through a disk scale height .",
    "interestingly , we find that our more extreme models are already ruled out by the current data ; shocked infall models with @xmath218 produce average intrinsic x - rays luminosities 12 orders - of - magnitude higher than observed .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that _ either angular momentum must be transported more slowly through the disk or the emission must be substantially obscured .",
    "_ while the remaining models are all roughly consistent with the data , none of the shocked infall models ( obscured or unobscured ) is more than an order - of - magnitude below the limits .",
    "the requirements of super - eddington accretion and substantial obscuration may be circumstantial evidence arguing against non - linear , shocked infall in high - redshift lbgs",
    ". however , _ only moderately more sensitive observations are necessary to probe the more reasonable parameter - space .",
    "_ while each individual x - ray observation need not get deeper , stacking a larger population of high - redshift lbgs might bear fruit .",
    "searches to expand the sample size of these objects are ongoing @xcite .",
    "focussing on lensed objects may also prove a way forward .",
    "however , it is clear that exploring high - redshift galaxies outside of the traditional uv bands will provide interesting opportunities to verify and inform models of the internal physics and formation of these systems .",
