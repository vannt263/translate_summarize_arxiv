    "a new era of particle physics has begun with the discovery of the neutral scalar by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations .",
    "it is entirely likely that this state is the long sought after higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) and is being pursued as a main window for new physics searches , though the recent results are already pointing towards a sm like higgs , final conclusion can only be drawn through a detailed study of the properties of the new boson .",
    "these studies will indicate , whether the decay widths of the particle are in accordance with the predictions of the sm or of its extensions .",
    "popular among the latter are the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) .",
    "the higgs sector in mssm consists of five physical higgs which includes two cp even higgs ( @xmath11 ) , one cp odd higgs @xmath12 and a pair of charged higgs ( @xmath13 ) . in case of nmssm , the @xmath14 parameter of mssm ,",
    "is replaced by @xmath15 , which is generated from a trilinear superpotential coupling @xmath16 , when @xmath17 obtains a vacuum expectation value @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two higgs doublet , whereas @xmath17 is the chiral singlet superfield .",
    "this term in turn leads to three cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath21 , two cp - odd higgs bosons , @xmath22 and a pair of charged higgs bosons , @xmath13 .",
    "the mssm as well as the nmssm predict the existence of a dark matter candidate , which in large parts of the parameter space is a neutralino . if the neutralino is sufficiently light , higgs decay to neutralinos",
    "will be kinematically allowed .",
    "such a light neutralino with the required relic density is still supported by the recent experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the presence of light neutralino therefore has implications on the higgs phenomenology , as it gives rise to the decay channel @xmath23 , i.e. invisible branching ratio . with the latest experimental results ,",
    "fits are being performed to check how much deviation is allowed by the recent data , in order to take into account new physics scenarios .",
    "the invisible higgs decay width has been constrained by various groups by performing fits of the signal strengths in various search channels using the latest lhc higgs data .",
    "the results of some of the most recent global fits :    1 .   considering the higgs couplings to the quarks , leptons and vector bosons to be free , + br@xmath24 0.16 ( 0.38 ) at 68% ( 95% ) cl  @xcite .",
    "2 .   with the assumption that the higgs coupling to fermions and gauge bosons are sm like , and",
    "the only new physics is from the higgs invisible decay width , + br@xmath25 0.52 at 68% cl  @xcite .",
    "direct search for invisible decaying higgs produced in association with a @xmath26 boson has been carried out by the atlas and cms collaborations in lhc .",
    "they have , in turn , placed limits on the branching fraction of the higgs boson to invisible particles , with the branching fraction greater than 65% and 75% excluded at 95% cl by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite respectively .",
    "the cms collaboration has also carried out a similar search for invisible branching ratio of the higgs boson produced in the vector boson fusion process and have placed an upper limit of 69%  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for susy particles at the lhc so far have come empty handed .",
    "furthermore , several analyses based on simple versions of the mssm and other models have ruled out significant regions of the parameter space .",
    "however , the parameter space under more general assumptions still remains largely unexplored .",
    "one possibility of exploring these regions is to ask under what conditions the 126 gev state corresponds to the neutral higgs particles in the spectrum of the model .",
    "popular among these is the case where the lightest higgs boson of mssm ( @xmath27 ) and nmssm ( @xmath28 ) is identified with the state discovered at lhc at 126 gev and has been studied in great detail . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the decay of this lightest higgs boson into neutralinos in these low energy supersymmetric models .",
    "the neutralino sector of these models were then constrained , from the limits on the invisible decay width .",
    "the regions of the parameter space where the lightest higgs boson has a mass of around 126 gev was isolated and then the regions where this higgs can decay into light neutralinos were studied in details .",
    "it was found that it was not possible to have a massless neutralino in mssm both in case of universal and nonuniversal gaugino masses at the gut scale , except for some higher representation of @xmath8 . in case of nmssm",
    "although it was possible to have a massless neutralino with universal gaugino masses at the gut scale , it was not possible to obtain @xmath29 = 126 gev and simultaneously have massless neutralino or @xmath30 .",
    "the results were therefore obtained by considering the soft gaugino masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 as two independent parameters , unconstrained by grand unification . in case of nmssm , for certain regions of the parameter space",
    "there were additional nonstandard decay channels like @xmath31 .",
    "the composition of the @xmath32 was important in determining the invisible branching ratio , with some regions of the parameter space allowing large invisible branching ratio .",
    "note that there are no a priori reasons to believe that the 126 gev boson is the lightest higgs boson . in the mssm either @xmath27 and @xmath33 can be identified with the discovered 126 gev boson , with either @xmath2 126 gev , @xmath34 800 gev or @xmath1 126 gev , @xmath35 .",
    "analogously for the nmssm there can be many choices , ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 126 gev , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 126 gev , and @xmath41 .",
    "the mass of the cp - odd higgs bosons varies in the range of 4 gev to tev ( to be discussed later ) , whereas the charged higgs boson are very massive with masses of the order 1 tev .",
    "this scenario with @xmath42 126 gev is mainly in light of the observed lep excess  @xcite in the @xmath43 channel around @xmath44 100 gev , which indicates that there may be a lighter higgs boson less than 100 gev .",
    "here we take this possibility seriously and ask under what circumstances this is realized , and to what extent the measured properties allow this scenario to survive .",
    "crucial to this is the possibility that the uncertainty in the width is saturated by invisible decays , rendered possible when there are states lighter than 63 gev in the spectrum . in this work",
    "we firstly delineate regions of the parameter space , which give rise to two light higgs and then study in details the branching ratio of the 126 gev higgs to non standard sm particles .",
    "this second lightest 126 gev higgs can decay to a pair of lightest neutralinos as well as to a pair of lightest higgs in some regions of parameter space .",
    "we consider both the cases here . moreover in case of nmssm , the decay of @xmath45 to a pair of @xmath46 is also kinematically allowed in some regions . considering the limit on the invisible branching ratio from the experiments and global fits , the neutralino sector of these supersymmetric models",
    "are then constrained accordingly . in most studies , the parameter space of the models",
    "are constrained with the assumption of the universality of the gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "note the gaugino masses need not be universal at the gut scale .",
    "this happens when the sm gauge group is embedded in a grand unified gauge group .",
    "the phenomenology of the neutralinos at the weak scale , is then affected via the renormalization group evolution of these gaugino mass parameters . at the weak scale",
    ", there will be a possibility of massless neutralinos  @xcite depending on the gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "we find that for the parameter space which allows a 126 gev , the second lightest higgs boson in mssm , analogous to the case where the 126 gev state was identified with the lightest higgs boson , it is not possible to have a massless neutralino with universal gaugino mass parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the result holds even for nonuniversal gaugino mass parameters except for a higher dimensional representation of @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , the decay of higgs to lightest neutralinos ( @xmath47 ) is allowed for some representations in case of mssm with nonuniversal gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "analogous in the case of the nmssm , it is not possible to obtain @xmath48 = 126 gev and simultaneously have massless neutralinos , with universal gaugino masses at the gut scale but the decay of the higgs ( @xmath45 ) to the lightest neutralinos is allowed ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "this assumption of the gut relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is biased to a particular scenario , so we do not consider the universality assumption on the gaugino mass parameters and rather treat @xmath9 , @xmath10 as two independent parameters .    in view of the considerations",
    "above , we have now considered the possibility of the second lightest neutral higgs to be the 126 gev state discovered by the lhc , in some versions of the mssm and the nmssm along with its invisible decays due to the presence of light neutralinos or other light states present in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the outline of the draft is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mssm ] we study the existence of a massless neutralino or a neutralino with mass less than the half the mass of 126 gev higgs boson in the context of mssm , with appropriate boundary conditions as dictated by grand unification based on @xmath51 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge groups .",
    "the relevant experimental constraints on the lightest higgs ( @xmath52 , with @xmath53 126 gev ) as well as other susy particles is considered .",
    "the decay of the lightest as well as the second lightest higgs to neutralinos is considered in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : mssm ] .",
    "the higgs sector in case of nmssm is investigated in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmssm ] .",
    "we first isolate the parameter space which supports @xmath45 in the appropriate mass window 123 - 127 gev .",
    "then the invisible decay of the second lightest higgs boson along with the other nonstandard decay modes is considered in detail .",
    "the dominant decay mode of the lightest higgs boson @xmath28 is also considered in this section . finally , we summarize our results in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us begin by recalling that the higgs sector in mssm has five physical mass eigenstates , two cp even and one cp odd neutral along with a pair of charged scalar bosons .",
    "the higgs spectrum at tree level is completely determined by two independent parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath55 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and @xmath54 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs .",
    "in addition to this , the mssm higgs sector also depends on the stop masses along with the stop mixing parameter @xmath56 , when the radiative corrections are taken into account .",
    "here @xmath57 , with @xmath58 as the trilinear higgs - stop coupling and @xmath14 is the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm , with a higgs boson of mass @xmath59 126 gev , and with sm like cross sections and branching fractions , can be broadly divided into two distinct regimes depending on the magnitude of @xmath54 .    * the decoupling regime , where @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the lightest cp even boson @xmath27 has mass around 126 gev , whereas all the others @xmath33 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are almost degenerate and have mass equal to @xmath54 . *",
    "the non - decoupling regime is the one where @xmath61 gev .",
    "the heavy cp even state @xmath33 is sm like , whereas the other neutral bosons are almost degenerate in mass @xmath62 .",
    "the mass of @xmath27 and @xmath12 can vary from the @xmath26 boson mass to the heavy neutral state @xmath33 , depending on the value of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the charged state @xmath13 will be slightly heavier , but still light enough to be detected in the large hadron collider . moreover in this regime , with the mass of @xmath33 being around 126 gev , the mass of the other gauge bosons like @xmath63 and @xmath13 are bounded from above .",
    "the lep collaborations have placed lower bounds on the masses of the neutral higgs boson @xmath54 and the lightest scalar @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the lower bounds on @xmath64 and @xmath54 are usually obtained from the upper bound on the cross section @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this in turn has led to values of @xmath64 and @xmath54 less than 92.9 gev and 93.4 gev being excluded at 95% c.l . along with it",
    "values of @xmath55 between 0.7 and 2 are also excluded .",
    "recent searches of the extra higgs boson at the lhc have put new bounds on @xmath55 as a function of @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "cms data  @xcite has excluded regions of @xmath67 above 6 for @xmath54 below 250 gev in the @xmath68 scenario .",
    "the main focus in this present work will be on the non - decoupling regime , and as a result , we would like to make some observations on the value of @xmath54 and @xmath55 chosen for our analysis . since this regime is mainly characterized by the pseudoscalar mass being less than 150 gev , we plot in fig .",

    "[ fig : ma_dependence ] shows the masses of the higgs bosons as a function of @xmath54 for @xmath55 = 40 .",
    "we see that for our choice of susy parameters , for @xmath54 around 125 gev , the three neutral higgs bosons have comparable masses , @xmath71 .",
    "this special case where the higgs masses are close to each other , is called the intense coupling scenario .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of this scenario has been studied in details in the past  @xcite .",
    "it has been known that in this intense coupling scenario the neutral bosons ( @xmath72 ) couplings to the gauge bosons are suppressed with respect to the sm , since @xmath12 does not couple to the gauge bosons .",
    "furthermore , the neutral bosons in this case will mainly decay to the down type fermions , due to the enhancement of its coupling .",
    "the recent lhc results being favoring a sm like higgs along with large values of @xmath67 being disfavored by the cms data , we have concentrated on the case with @xmath73 100 gev and small values of @xmath55 , in order to have the cross section times branching ratio of the higgs to any sm particle in agreement with the recent lhc results . the value of @xmath55 is tuned along with the parameter @xmath58 , so that @xmath70 is in the range 124 @xmath74 127 gev , and @xmath75 97 gev . in the past , various studies have shown that certain regions of the parameter space of mssm , allow a higgs boson with mass 126 gev both in the decoupling and non - decoupling regime , satisfying the lhc constraints . for most of the allowed parameter space ,",
    "the higgs decay to the lightest neutralinos is kinematically allowed , leading to invisible decay modes .",
    "it will therefore be very important to study the couplings of the newly discovered particle at high precision .",
    "as mentioned before global fits have been performed on the couplings of the newly discovered particle , in order to place upper bounds on the invisible decay width .",
    "taking into account these bounds , the parameter space of these new physics scenarios can be further constrained , since the regions giving a large invisible higgs decay branching ratio will be in conflict with the experiments .",
    "this was earlier done in the context of mssm , in the decoupling scenario , where it was found that large regions in @xmath76 parameter space was disfavored  @xcite by the bounds on the invisible higgs decay width , for different values of @xmath55 . in this work ,",
    "we have investigated further to see whether the same result holds in the non - decoupling scenario , assuming @xmath33 to be the 126 gev boson .    before proceeding further we give a brief review of the neutralino sector in the mssm .",
    "the physical mass eigenstates are obtained after the electroweak symmetry breaking , from the diagonalization of the neutralino mass matrix  @xcite , with the neutralinos being an admixture of the fermionic partners of the two higgs doublets , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the fermionic partners of the neutral gauge bosons .",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the @xmath78 and the @xmath79 soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass parameters , @xmath14 is the higgs(ino ) mass parameter , @xmath80 is the @xmath26 boson mass , @xmath81 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath82 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two higgs doublet fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "since we are concentrating on the higgs invisible decay mode , the light neutralino eigenstate of the neutralino mass matrix  ( [ mssmneut ] ) is favorable .",
    "therefore we consider the limiting case of the massless neutralino , which , at the tree level , arises when the determinant of the mass matrix ( [ mssmneut ] ) is zero .",

    "@xcite it was found that it is not possible to have a massless neutralino , both with the gaugino parameters being universal and non universal at the gut scale , except for some higher representation of @xmath8 .",
    "the light neutralino with mass less than half the mass of the higgs boson , is still not ruled out by the current experiments .",
    "it is seen that for the models , with the ratio of @xmath87 @xmath88 1/28 , the invisible decay of higgs to the lightest neutralinos is allowed and holds true for both the coupling and the non - decoupling regimes of mssm .",
    "this is mainly by taking into account the constraint on the gluino mass ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90 1.3 tev from the lhc experiments , and the other gaugino mass parameters being relatively fixed from the boundary conditions at the electroweak scale . as can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite , this condition on the ratio @xmath87 is satisfied by some of the higher dimensional representation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .      in this section",
    "we mainly concentrate on constraining the higgs parameter space in case of mssm , from the higgs invisible decay width .",
    "one of the main assumptions that go into limiting the parameter space of these models is the universality of the gaugino mass parameters at the gut scale .",
    "the lep constraint on the charginos , has led to lower bound on the lightest neutralino mass @xmath91 at 95% c.l . in the context of the mssm , assuming universal gaugino masses at the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "the gaugino mass parameters need not be universal at the gut scale , therefore the phenomenology of the neutralinos in all these cases will be affected depending on the renormalization group evolution of the gaugino mass parameters .",
    "we do not consider any specific representations , but instead consider a more generic case with @xmath9 and @xmath10 as independent parameters , in the non - decoupling scenario . with this consideration",

    "fig : sce1_1 ] can be readily understood from the fact that , since @xmath118 also depends on @xmath116 and @xmath9 , at low values of @xmath9 , the decay channel @xmath115 is kinematically accessible . this is shown by red - dashed lines which decreases with increasing @xmath9 due to the increase in mass of @xmath119 , and the opening of the channel @xmath114 .",

    "the value of @xmath126 in scenario 2 is smaller compared to that of scenario 1 , as can be seen from table  [ tab : bs_param ] .",
    "since the neutralino mass ( @xmath127 ) increases with decreasing @xmath126 , the neutralinos in this case are more massive .",

    "the allowed parameter space can only be constrained by the future lhc results .",
    "we would further add that the composition of the lightest and the second lightest neutralino is similar to scenario 1 .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sce2_2 ] , the contours of constant branching ratio of the lightest cp even higgs to a pair of @xmath39 quarks , which is the dominant decay mode .",
    "the br can be as high as 80% for most of the @xmath113 parameter space . when the neutralino is light enough allowing for the invisible decay mode of the light higgs ( @xmath28 ) , the br decrease by about 20%",
    ". it will be possible to observe this state at the lhc , through the @xmath128 decay mode .",
    "the lightest pseudoscalar higgs in this scenario is heavier than @xmath28 and @xmath45 , but is considerably lighter to be observed at the lhc .",
    "nevertheless the dominant decay mode of @xmath36 will be to a pair of neutralinos , and the second dominant mode will be to a pair of @xmath39 quarks .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath36 will therefore be difficult to be observed in the lhc , due to a large invisible br .",
    "this shows that the global fits from the recent lhc data is unable to constrain the neutralino sector of the nmssm , when the second lightest scalar is identified as the 126 gev higgs .",
    "we would like to add that the analysis carried out in this work can also be repeated for negative values of @xmath129 .",
    "however , we have found that in this case for most of the parameter space with @xmath45 around 126 gev , the limits on the invisible branching ratio can not constrain the parameter space as is the case with positive values of @xmath129 . a more detailed precision study in the higgs sector",
    "is allowed so as to constrain the parameter space in this case .",
    "in this work we have considered the possibility of the invisible decays of the second lightest cp even higgs boson in the context of both mssm and nmssm .",
    "the second lightest higgs behaves as the sm like higgs with mass in the allowed mass range @xmath59 [ 124 , 127 ] gev .",
    "the neutralino sector in the last few years has been studied in details and also constrained by the data from different astrophysical , cosmological and collider experiments .",
    "the recent lhc results on the higgs branching ratio has independently constrained the higgs invisible branching ratio , through global fits .",
    "the higgs can decay to a pair of neutralinos giving rise to invisible decay branching ratio provided @xmath130 .",
    "this invisible higgs decay channel is also looked through direct searches at the lhc .",
    "it will therefore be important to consider the implications of the current information on higgs from the lhc , on the neutralino sector of the supersymmetric models . in the context of mssm",
    ", we discuss in brief whether it will be possible for the sm like higgs to decay to a pair of neutralinos , with both universal and nonuniversal gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "we find that with universal gaugino masses , the invisible decay channel @xmath6 is kinematically not allowed . nevertheless in case of nonuniversal gaugino masses , for certain representations of @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", the 126 gev higgs will have a considerable invisible branching ratio .",
    "we have then analyzed the possibility of having a large invisible branching ratio in the context of nmssm which has a richer neutralino and higgs sector compared to the mssm .",
    "we find that in case of the nmssm it is possible to have the invisible decay channel ( @xmath114 ) with universal gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "the assumption of the gut relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 being largely model dependent , we have considered a more general case and have done our analyses by treating @xmath9 and @xmath10 as two independent parameters in case of both the mssm and the nmssm . with this assumption",
    ", there is an additional freedom of the neutralino being very light .",
    "we have then studied the decay of the higgs bosons ( @xmath27 and @xmath33 ) to a pair of lightest neutralinos in the context of the non - decoupling scenario of the mssm .",
    "we have considered the possibility that the 126 gev scalar ( @xmath33 ) observed at the lhc along with the 98 gev scalar ( @xmath27 ) from the lep excess in the @xmath128 final state can be concurrently explained in the mssm framework .",
    "we find that there are regions in the mssm parameter space where such scenarios exist .",
    "the neutralino sector being dependent on the parameters @xmath131 , we give our results for a fixed value of @xmath55 and @xmath10 in the @xmath99 plane because we are mainly interested in the higgs decay channel to a pair of neutralinos .",
    "we find the invisible br in this case is too small to be constrained by the recent lhc fits from the higgs data .",
    "this is in contrast to the case when the lightest cp even higgs boson ( @xmath27 ) was sm like  @xcite , the decoupling scenario .",
    "there it was found that with @xmath2 126 gev , a large portion of the @xmath99 parameter space for a fixed value of @xmath55 and @xmath10 allowed a large invisible branching ratio in conflict with the latest lhc fits from the higgs sector , thereby constraining the neutralino parameter space .",
    "therefore if the non - decoupling scenario exists , the parameter space of the neutralino sector can not be constrained by the recent lhc data .",
    "higher precision higgs physics is required to constrain the parameter space in the scenario .",
    "this scenario can be alternatively tested by looking for the other higgs bosons production , @xmath132 98 gev , @xmath73 100 - 150 gev and @xmath133 150 - 200 gev at the lhc .",
    "we do not consider the possibility here .",
    "the dependence of our results on the other input parameters is also discussed in details .",
    "an analogous analysis is then performed in the context of the nmssm .",
    "the number of independent parameters in the neutralino and the higgs sector is greater than that of the mssm .",
    "we have performed a scan over the parameters contributing to the neutralino sector of the nmssm and have plotted the points which pass the various theoretical and experimental constraints discussed in the text , along with the condition that the second lightest higgs @xmath45 behaves like the sm higgs boson .",
    "the points which survive these constraints are then divided into three scenarios , depending on the mass of the other higgs bosons .",
    "we firstly separately isolate the points where both @xmath134 is less than @xmath135 , but only the decay of @xmath45 to a pair of cp odd higgs @xmath46 is kinematically allowed .",
    "secondly we consider the case when the mass of the lightest higgs boson ( @xmath28 ) is less than half the mass of @xmath45 , that is the decay @xmath136 is kinematically allowed .",
    "we have considered a single benchmark point for these two scenarios and have exclusively worked out the results .",
    "the dependence of the results on the other points can be suitably interpreted .",
    "there are regions in the parameter space which also satisfies the 98 ( @xmath28 ) + 126 ( @xmath45 ) gev higgs scenario , so as to account for the lep excess along with the higgs data from the lhc .",
    "we list the points which fall in this parameter space , but we do not consider benchmark point in this case as the results will be similar to the first scenario . we see that the invisible branching ratio reaches a maximum of 20% , for the two scenarios considered here , still too small to be be constrained by the recent lhc fits from the higgs data .",
    "the result is thus similar to mssm , where with the second lightest scalar being 126 gev , it is currently not possible to constrain the neutralino parameter space from the higgs data .",
    "the situation will improve with more data from the next lhc run .",
    "overall we find that in the context of both mssm and nmssm , it is not possible to constrain the neutralino sector from the recent higgs data , if the second lightest scalar is identified with the one observed at the lhc .",
    "the presence of the other light higgs will however lead to interesting collider signals at the lhc , which will alternatively test these scenarios",
    ". it will be worthwhile to do a detailed collider study of these light higgs and find the reach of the lhc .",
    "the direct detection of some susy particles in the 13 and 14 tev runs of the lhc would significantly cut down the arbitrariness of extensions of the sm to its susy variants after which a precision higgs era could be pursued at the lhc .",
    "hopefully this can be pursued in the near future .",
    "we would like to thank b. ananthanarayan for a careful reading of the manuscript and constructive suggestions .",
    "mp would also like to thank dipan sengupta for help regarding micromegas .",
