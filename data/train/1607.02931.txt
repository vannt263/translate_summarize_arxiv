    "there is an inconsistency between the amount of matter inferred from gravitational effects and the one we see on observable scales .",

    "evidence arises from astrophysical and cosmological probes @xcite , such as the kinematics of virially bound systems , rotation curves of spiral galaxies , strong and weak lensing , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) information on matter density and geometry of the universe , mass - to - light ratios in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) , and large surveys to measure universe structures . because of the limits inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis",
    ", an important fraction of dm should be non baryonic .",
    "although the nature of dm is still unknown , a popular hypothesis considers that dm consists of elementary particles .",
    "dm is the main component of galaxies , being in average at least six times more abundant than baryonic matter ( more than 81@xmath0 of the matter in the universe ) , but its nature is still unknown .",
    "dm self - interactions have been unobserved so far , and dm particle candidates are bound by gravitational interactions .",
    "very distinct predictions for small scale structures in the universe ( 100 kpc ) are obtained by dm particles with different mass scales @xcite .",
    "wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) are popular candidates to dm that have masses of the order of gev or even tev .",
    "this type of particles fall in the category of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , which predicts too many galaxy satellites in the milky way and cusped profiles for the mass density of galaxies up to scales below 1 kpc , contradicting present observational evidences . on the contrary ,",
    "particles with mass in the kev scale , namely warm dark matter ( wdm ) @xcite , are able to reproduce the number of observed satellite galaxies , as well as the cored profiles found in dm - dominated objects such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "astrophysical observations from dm - dominated objects as well as theoretical analysis lead to a dm particle with a mass of a few kev ( around 2 kev @xcite ) .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton detections in the x - ray spectra of the perseus galaxy cluster ( dm dominated ) seem to be consistent with the kev mass range .",
    "furthermore , wdm quantum effects @xcite could be important near the galaxy centre , showing a fermionic nature for the dm particle through the manifestation of quantum non vanishing pressure versus gravity .",
    "as it is well known , the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles does not describe dm particles , nor does it provide a mass for active neutrinos ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) . in this model , neutrino eigenstates are left - handed , and they transform as doublets under the weak su(2 ) gauge group . in extended sm models",
    "@xcite , additional su(3 ) x su(2 ) x u(1 ) singlet right - handed neutrinos are introduced .",
    "neutrino mass eigenstates will be linear combinations of the left and right - handed states , and mass matrix eigenvalues will split into lighter and heavier states ( seesaw mechanism )",
    ". the lighter mass eigenstates would be the main components of the active flavor eigenstates of the neutrinos , whereas the heavier ones would be dominant in sterile neutrino flavors @xcite .",
    "some extended sm models add three extra neutrino mass eigenstates , one with a mass of the order of kev @xcite .",
    "neutrinos in the kev mass scale open the possibility to detect warm dark matter in nuclear electron capture and beta decay .    in this paper , we assume that a kev neutrino , a sound candidate for dm , is produced in ordinary weak nuclear processes , such as beta decay and electron capture , via neutrino mixing .",
    "present experiments , searching active neutrino masses , are also looking for sterile neutrinos in the kev range @xcite ( mare @xcite , katrin @xcite , echo @xcite , ptolemy @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the neutrino ( or antineutrino ) emitted in a weak nuclear decay has an effect on the energy spectrum of the process , as was first shown by enrico fermi in the early 1930s @xcite . for the active , very light neutrinos",
    ", this effect shows up at the endpoint of the spectrum , whereas for sterile neutrinos it appears at a distance @xmath4 below the endpoint , where @xmath4 is the mass of the heavy mass eigenstate component of the sterile neutrino ( see below ) . in order to leave a fingerprint in the spectra , this mass must be lower than the energy available in the decay , or @xmath5-value .",
    "the energy spectrum to be analyzed corresponds to the emitted charged lepton in the case of beta decay , namely , the spontaneous conversion of a neutron into a proton or viceversa with emission of the charged lepton and a antineutrino or neutrino . in the case of electron capture only a neutrino is emitted and no charged lepton comes out . therefore the spectrum to be measured corresponds to the de - excitation of the daughter atom , which initially contains a hole in the shell from which the electron was captured .",
    "neutrino properties are currently being studied experimentally with high intensities and high sensitivities @xcite .",
    "experiments are under way to determine directly the active neutrino mass from neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite as well as from single beta decay @xcite and electron capture @xcite .",
    "the last two also provide a way to search for wdm sterile neutrinos in the measured spectra . in electron capture experiments , the atomic de - excitation spectrum collected in a calorimeter",
    "is directly linked to the excitation energies of the final atoms or molecules , whereas in beta decay , the fact that the atoms or molecules may remain excited poses a challenge on the interpretation of the electron spectrum .",
    "in addition , electron capture experiments take advantage of the larger statistics in the spectrum regions around the capture resonances , and measurements are rather independent of the capture and the atomic de - excitation mechanisms , as will be discussed later . a disadvantage of electron capture measurements",
    "is that in a calorimeter , where the full energy range of the spectrum is measured , pile - up can be a problem that must be prevented by using a low activity material .",
    "already observed neutrino oscillations ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) among light active neutrinos are due to the fact that there is a mismatch between the neutrino flavor eigenstates and the mass eigenstates .",
    "each flavor eigenstate , associated to a charged lepton , can be written as a combination of mass eigenstates , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "for instance , the neutrino flavor eigenstate emitted after electron capture , called electron neutrino @xmath6 , can be written as a combination of the three light sm mass eigenstates and , hypothetically , of one or more extra , heavier mass eigenstates as @xcite @xmath7 where the subscript @xmath8 stands for extra ( heavier ) mass eigenstates , and the quantities @xmath9 belong to the unitary neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the masses of the three light sm mass eigenstates are so close to each other that usually no measurement is able to discern which of them has been emitted in a given process . as a result ,",
    "the three are emitted as a coherent superposition to which an effective mass can be assigned : @xmath10 which is close to the mass of any of the three light neutrinos .",
    "this superposition is at the origin of the neutrino oscillation phenomenology .",
    "the phase of each mass eigenstate changes at a different rate while travelling , giving rise to a different superposition at each location that translates into a varying ( oscillatory ) probability of detection of a given flavor eigenstate .    to simplify things we will consider here the coherent superposition of light mass eigenstates as a unique , effective neutrino mass eigenstate , called ` light ' , and just one extra mass eigenstate , clearly heavier than the others , called ` heavy ' : @xmath11 where the mixing amplitudes have been written in terms of a mixing angle @xmath12 between the light and the heavy neutrino mass eigenstate .",
    "the other possible combination of these two mass eigenstates would be the sterile flavor eigenstate : @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "for the sterile neutrinos that can be relevant as wdm , cosmological constraints based on the observed average dark matter density suggest that the value of the mixing angle could approximately be @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrino states with masses close to the ones of the active neutrinos can also have an impact on the patterns measured in oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "the differential energy spectrum of a weak process where an electronic neutrino is emitted can therefore be decomposed in a term for light neutrino emission and another term for heavy neutrino emission as follows @xcite : @xmath16 this energy spectrum can be the one of the electron emitted in beta decay or the one of the daughter atom de - excitation in electron capture .",
    "the heavy mass eigenstate , if it exists , would be emitted independently of the other masses ( non coherently ) as long as the energy resolution of the detector is better than the mass difference , @xmath17 .",
    "its contribution to the measured spectrum , @xmath18 , would show up in the range where the collected energy is small enough for the heavy neutrino mass to have been produced , namely when @xmath19 , where @xmath5 is the difference between the masses of the initial and the final nuclei or atoms ( @xmath5-value of the reaction ) . at the edge of that region , at @xmath20 , a kink in the spectrum would be found .",
    "let us consider the capture of an atomic electron by the nucleus @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) to turn into the nucleus @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the reaction involving the corresponding atoms ( represented by the symbol of the nucleus within brackets ) begins with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a neutrino mass eigenstate and the superscript @xmath29 accounts for particle - hole excitations corresponding to an electron hole in the shell @xmath29 of the excited daughter atom , due to the electron capture from this shell in the parent atom .",
    "this is followed by electromagnetic de - excitation ( x - ray ) of the atom : @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for photon(s ) , or by electron emission ( auger or coster - kronig process ) with subsequent electromagnetic de - excitation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent other holes in the electron shells .",

    "the excitation energy is the difference between the binding energies of the captured electron shell and the outermost shell .",
    "the former refers to the daughter atom , whereas the latter refers to the parent : @xmath37 .",
    "the reason is that for the shells above the vacancy the effective charge is closer to the one in the parent atom ( there is one proton less in the nucleus but also one electron less in an inner shell ) and therefore its binding energies should be used @xcite .    an alternative capture process to the one in eq .",
    "( [ atomic_capture ] ) is the following : @xmath38 where the instantaneous electron emission , that leaves an extra hole @xmath33 , is due to the mismatch between the @xmath33 electron wave function in the parent atom , @xmath39 , and in the daughter atom with a hole in @xmath29 , @xmath40 .",
    "the de - excitation of the final atom contributes to the calorimeter energy with a peak at an energy approximately equal to the sum of the binding energies of the @xmath29 and @xmath33 electrons , @xmath41 .",

    "whereas the hole @xmath29 is left by the captured electron and therefore fulfils the energy and angular momentum conditions for such process , the hole @xmath33 has a different origin , namely the above mentioned incomplete overlap of electron wave functions , and may occur in many more electron shells .",
    "it is important to notice that some electron emission processes of the type @xmath42 where none of the holes in the daughter atom correspond to the captured electron @xmath29 , are quantum mechanically indistinguishable from the three - step process in eqs .",

    "( [ ratio_beta ] ) , for the tritium beta decay , as a function of the electron momentum for a heavy neutrino mass @xmath143 2 kev and different mixing angles.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "signatures of hypothetical kev sterile neutrinos , which are warm dark matter candidates ( wdm ) , could be found in the spectra of ordinary weak nuclear decays .",
    "the electron spectrum in beta decay is cleaner for this purpose , but the calorimeter spectrum in electron capture might have the advantages of having higher statistics near the capture peaks and of being largely independent of the excitation and de - excitation mechanisms of the final atoms . in both weak",
    "processes the small value of the light - heavy neutrino mixing angle requires extremely high experimental precision and the use of sources with large stability to reduce systematic errors . for the same reason we propose to analyze the data in terms of some relevant ratios , as first introduced in @xcite . in the case of electron",
    "capture , the ratio of events accumulated in different regions of the spectrum ( preferably each containing a single capture peak ) allows us to remove uncertainties related to the nuclear matrix element and to the values of overall constants .",
    "similarly , ratios of different isotopes allow us to remove uncertainties from atomic parameters .",
    "it is important to remark that the theoretical quantities @xmath169 and @xmath170 computed as described above contain several approximations .",
    "they correspond to dirac - delta peaks , ignoring the actual shapes and widths , and thus they just refer to one capture peak , neglecting the possible effect of the tails of nearby one - hole peaks . moreover , the influence of two - hole peaks close to the main ones has also been neglected .",
    "other effects that have not been taken into account but whose influence is expected to be very small @xcite are multi - hole ( more than two ) peaks , virtual intermediate states ( influence of transitions through atomic shells not energetically accesible ) or interference between atomic transitions resulting from addition of amplitudes instead of intensities . all these effects could be expected to play a smaller role in the ratios defined in this paper . similarly , isotopic shifts in the atomic shells are assumed to be negligible .",
    "the accurate experimental determination of the ratio @xmath147 entails its own difficulties , among them the possible existence of metastable atomic states whose delayed de - excitations fail to contribute to the collected spectrum , and the variety of chemical environments resulting in a complex mixture of @xmath5-values . in any case , both the experimental measurement and the theoretical model must be accurate enough to find differences in the expected versus the measured ratios of the order of the mixing angle squared , @xmath171 .",
    "this is also the size of the kink expected in the electron spectrum of beta decay , located at the limit of the region where the heavy neutrino is energetically allowed . in order to identify this kink among the statistical fluctuations of the measured spectrum",
    ", the number of collected events must be larger than the inverse of the squared ratio @xmath166 in eq .",
