    "solar active region ( ar ) 11158 emerged in the eastern solar hemisphere on february 11 , which is consists of bipolar fields showing the complicated behaviors including the strongly sheared and twisted motions ( @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , it produced one x - class flare and several m - class flares on february 2011 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) . fortunately ,",
    "solar physics satellites , the solar dynamics observatory ( _ sdo _ ) , and _ hinode _ ( @xcite ) provide rich data with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions obtained by multi - wavelength observations , enabling us to further understand the dynamics of these solar flares , _ e.g. , _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in general the solar flares",
    "are widely considered as release phenomena of free magnetic energy accumulated in the solar corona ( @xcite ) , it s therefore important matter to understand the three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic field to know where the free energy is accumulated in the ar .",
    "unfortunately we can not directly measure the coronal magnetic field even by the state - of - art ground or space observations which provide only 2d vector magnetic field on the photosphere . in this kind of situation , nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff )",
    "extrapolation from the vector field is a solid tool due to allow us to show 3d view of the magnetic field ( see @xcite in details ) .",
    "the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) on board a ( _ sdo _ ) and the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) on board _ hinode _ provide the vector field data , which were already applied to extrapolate the 3d magnetic field under the nlfff approximation by earlier studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) . in common of them ,",
    "they show that the strongly twisted and sheared field lines are found to reside at close to the polarity inversion line ( pil ) before the flare , which are confirmed to relax after the flare .",
    "some earlier studies analyzed the nlfff and suggested the dynamics of the m6.6 or x2.2-class flares due to compare the nlfff with multi - wavelength observations or nlfff configurations before and after the flares .",
    "@xcite suggested the possibility of tether - cutting reconnection ( @xcite ) in x2.2-class solar flare through multi - wavelength analysis .",
    "@xcite also analyzed the nlfff , showing the energy distribution of it in space and temporal evolution as well as suggesting an evidence of the tether - cutting reconnection on the variation of the field lines connectivity before and after the flare .",
    "@xcite analyzed the nlfff just before and after the m6.6-class solar flare and found that the strong coronal current system underwent an apparent downward collapse and a small current - carrying loop was produced closer to the surface , suggesting that the tether - cutting reconnection is a suitable model .",
    "more recently , @xcite estimated the twist of a field line and investigated the connectivity of a field line , consequently the obtained results were consistent with the tether - cutting magnetic reconnection model .",
    "@xcite also estimated the magnetic twist of the nlfff before the x2.2-class flare in ar 11158 , reconstructed by mhd relaxation method ( @xcite ) and found that the strongly twisted lines having more than a half - turn twist but less than one - turn are related to this flare because their footpoints well correspond to the location where the two - ribbon flares in image taken by sot/_hinode _ are enhanced .",
    "this result indicates that the nlfff is found to be stable state against an ideal mhd instability , in other words , the tether - cutting reconnection would be needed to generate the more strongly twisted lines with more than one - turn twist , which might have a potential to produce the eruptive phenomena .",
    "however , because these nlfffs , which are constructed in the steady sate , can not reveal the dynamics in the solar flares , we can not verify the occurrence of tether - cutting reconnection . in this study",
    ", we explore the mhd dynamics of the x2.2 solar flare on 2011 february 15 , using mhd simulation involving the nlfff .",
    "this simulation can tell us the dynamics of the magnetic field in close to the real situation , and then enable us to directly compare the results to observations . in this paper",
    "we show the results focusing on an overview of the 3d dynamics of the magnetic field and comparison of them with observations .",
    "the detailed dynamics , _",
    "e.g. _ , it associated with the complicated reconnection process during flare will be shown in next paper . this paper is constructed as follows .",
    "our observational data and numerical method are described in section 2 .",
    "our results are presented in sections 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "our conclusion is summarized in section 4 .",
    "to extrapolate the nlfff , we use the vector magnetic field shown in left panel of figure [ f1](a ) , observed at 00:00 ut on 2011 february 15 , approximately 120 minutes before the x2.2-class flare detected by hmi/_sdo_. the vector magnetic field covers a 216 @xmath0 216 ( mm@xmath1 ) region , divided by a 600 @xmath0 600 grid which is provided by the description of cea projected and remapped vector magnetic field .",
    "it is obtained using the very fast inversion of the stokes vector ( vfisv ) algorithm ( @xcite ) based on the milne@xmath2eddington approximation . a minimum energy method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "was used to resolve 180@xmath3 ambiguity in the azimuth angle of the magnetic field .",
    "we also use extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) images observed with 94 and 171  taken by atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board _ sdo _ and h 3968  images during the flare taken by _ hinode _ , in order to compare with the nlfff and mhd simulation .",
    "images were obtained using the broadband filter imager of the sot on board _",
    "the field of view corresponds to 111.58 `` @xmath0 111.58 '' with a resolution of 1024 @xmath0 1024 at 01:50:18 ut on february 15 .",
    "we carry out the nlfff and mhd simulation according to the following equations ,    @xmath4    or    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    where nlfff calculation employs the equation ( [ eq_den_nlfff ] ) as the density evolution in order to ease the relaxation by equalizing the alfven speed in space as shown in @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is mass density , @xmath11 is an initial value of density where this density evolution is following @xcite , @xmath12 is the magnetic flux density , @xmath13 is the velocity , @xmath14 is the electric current density , and @xmath15 is a scalar potential .",
    "the last equation ( [ div_eq ] ) is used to reduce deviation from @xmath16 and was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the length , magnetic field , density , velocity , time , and electric current density are normalized by @xmath17 = 216 mm , @xmath18 = 2500 g , @xmath19 = @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic permeability , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the non - dimensional viscosity @xmath25 is set as a constant @xmath26 , and the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 in equation ( [ div_eq ] ) also fix the constant values , 0.04 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "subscript @xmath29 of @xmath30 corresponds to nlfff or mhd. these equation sets , normalize values and parameters are mostly identical to the previous our studies @xcite except the density evolution described in equation ( [ eq_den_mhd ] ) .    a formulation of @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 which is slightly different from @xcite , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the vector field shown in figure [ f1](a ) is preprocessed in accordance with @xcite and a potential field applied to an initial condition of the nlfff calculation is extrapolated using green function method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed tangential components of the magnetic field reside in the region enclosed by a dashed square , as shown the left panel in figure [ f1](a ) ; the outside region is fixed by the potential field , because we focused on the dynamics of the magnetic field in an early phase near the central area and constructing a field close to an equilibrium state numerically .",
    "note that , according to the mathematical formula , this state mixing of the force - free field and the potential field can not keep an equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , we employed this method in this study in order to avoid an effect from inconsistent force - free alpha residing outside area where the weak magnetic fields are dominated .",
    "next , we set mhd equations under the zero @xmath35 approximation ( @xcite or @xcite ) due to the low @xmath36(0.01 @xmath37 0.1 ) coronal plasma where the time evolution of density is according to the equation ( [ eq_den_nlfff ] ) being similar with @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ ; these equations are identical to the nlfff extrapolation method in @xcite or @xcite except the velocity limit is not imposed and the resistivity formulation is different .    initial condition on the density is given by @xmath38 in all mhd ( also nlfff ) calculations .",
    "in this case , the density is modeled by equation ( [ eq_den_nlfff ] ) ; therefore , we can not compare it with observational data exactly or discuss the time scale of the dynamics of the magnetic field , as the alfven time scale depends on this model .",
    "however , this formula might be more reasonable than that in the constant density , _ e.g _ , @xmath391.0 because the real coronal density is stratified due to gravity , then alfven wave is propagation effectively in the upper corona where the magnetic field is driven there .",
    "in addition to these , @xcite showed the dynamics of a flux tube using two types of density ; one is modeled by @xmath40 at every time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the density variation is not considered .",
    "another is obtained from a continuous equation ( [ eq_den_mhd ] ) .",
    "consequently , both dynamics of the magnetic field are nearly identical at the early eruptive phase .",
    "we will discuss later again in this paper .",
    "a resistivity formula is given as an anomalous resistivity as following , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the threshold current , set to 30 in this study .",
    "in this simulation , a numerical box with dimensions of 216 @xmath0 216 @xmath0 216 ( mm@xmath44 ) is given by 1 @xmath0 1 @xmath0 1 as a non - dimensional value .",
    "the grid number is assigned as 300 @xmath0 300 @xmath0 300 , which is 2 @xmath45 2 binning from the original data .",
    "regarding to the boundary conditions of nlfff ( run a ) and mhd relaxation processes ( run c ) , physical values on all of the boundaries are fixed ( fixed boundary condition ) , except for the neumann - type boundary condition on which the convenient potential @xmath15 is imposed . on the other hand , in mhd simulations ( run b , and run d - f ) , tangential components of the magnetic field are released on all of the boundaries ( released boundary conditions ) .",
    "the numerical scheme is quite identical to that in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the kind of simulation ( nlfff or mhd ) , equation of the density evolution , initial conditions , and boundary conditions used in each run are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we first show the 3d magnetic structure of nlfff and compare it with euv images taken by aia/_sdo_. we call this nlfff calculation run a and all of runs in this study are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the upper panels in figure [ f1 ] ( a ) shows the vector field map obtained from hmi , and euv images with 94  and 171  , respectively .",
    "the 3d field lines are plotted over each image shown in the middle panels in figure [ f1](b ) . in the lower corona , we found that the strongly sheared field lines are formed above pil located between the sunspots in the central area . on the other hand , although the large loops extending to upper corona can roughly capture the corona loops in aia images , these reconstructed field lines seem to be deviating from them as altitude increases .",
    "we perform further nlfff reconstruction on the basis of whole vector field , not partial reconstruction such as in figure [ f1](b ) , in order to further explore the reason of this problem .",
    "figure [ f1](c ) shows the nlfff according the above manner , not showing the noticeable difference from that in figure [ f1](b ) .",
    "consequently , the potential field and nlfff do not work effectively well on the reconstruction of the magnetic field in the upper corona .",
    "this is already suggested by @xcite that it might be difficult to reconstruct these overlying field lines exactly because they can not keep steady state due to that they are expanding to the further upper area pointed out by @xcite .",
    "next , we show the physical properties of nlfff , in particular , focusing on how much the reconstructed field is in a force - free state , its stability , and how much magnetic twist is accumulated in it .",
    "figure [ f2](a ) shows a distribution of the force - free alpha where the vertical and horizontal axes represent the values of the force - free @xmath46 estimated on opposite footpoints of each field line . like @xcite , these force - free alpha",
    "are estimated at 720 km approximately _",
    "i.e. _ 1 grid size in this case above the photosphere , and the field lines are traced from the region where @xmath47250 g. this result seems to be slightly larger scatter than that in previous our result of @xcite(see figure [ f2](a ) ) even though many points are aligned close to the line of y = x plotted in green .",
    "this might be due to the fine force - free @xmath46 compared to previous one residing in the vector field reduced by 8@xmath08 binning process .",
    "we perform an mhd simulations using reconstructed nlfff as an initial condition to find a state in details of the nlfff where the tangential components of the magnetic field are released on the bottom boundary , employing the constant resistivity .",
    "these calculation are named as run b. figure [ f2](b ) shows a temporal evolution of the kinetic energy @xmath48 for run b. its value increases initially because nlfff can not meet an equilibrium state exactly in addition to further deviate from the initial state due to the release of the tangential components of the magnetic field on the bottom surface , consequently the velocity is generated . on the other hand , after that , this profile being decrease as time goes on , which suggests that the reconstructed field is being back to the potential field even on the disturbances derived from the velocity .",
    "two insets in figure [ f2](b ) represent the 3d view of the field lines at @xmath49=0 and @xmath49=15 , marked by the circles .",
    "we clearly see that the twisted field lines at @xmath49=15 become looser than the initial state @xmath49=0 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the nlfff is in stable state and never shows the drastic dynamics as seen in the observations .",
    "we also investigate the magnetic twist that is here defined by @xmath50 @xmath46 and @xmath51 are force - free @xmath46(= @xmath52 ) and a line element of a field line , respectively .",
    "figure [ f2](c ) shows the 3d field lines over the @xmath53 distribution .",
    "orange lines represent the strongly twisted lines over the half - turn twist which are traced inside of the red contours ( @xmath540.5 ) shown in figure [ f2](d ) .",
    "figure [ f2](e ) represents the twist distribution on the positive polarity where these twists are plotted on the intense @xmath53 more than 0.2 ( = 500 g ) .",
    "this result indicates that the most of twists have a value less than one - turn , suggesting the stable against the kink mode instability .",
    "these results are quite same as previous our result in @xcite even though some parts of nlfff model are different .      from above section",
    "showing the physical properties of nlfff , we found that the nlfff never shows a dramatic dynamics or eruption away from the solar surface , which is contrary to the observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , there might be mechanism that excites the stable nlfff into dynamic unstable phase to cause the observed eruptive phenomena .",
    "so we perform the mhd relaxation process using the nlfff as an initial condition , which is similar manner with nlfff calculation in run a except a velocity limit is released and an anomalous resistivity described in equation ( [ ano_res ] ) is set in this calculation , in order to form a further strongly twisted lines more than one - turn twist . because the anomalous resistivity plays a role on enhancing the reconnection in the strong current region , we can expect it to generate the more strongly twisted lines through the reconnection than that formed in the nlfff . because the magnetic field is fixed at the bottom boundary during this calculation , more strongly twisted lines are formed without changing the original horizontal components on vector field , _ i.e. , _ map of the observed force - free @xmath46 on the vector field is not changed .",
    "we call this calculation run c.    figure [ f3 ] shows a temporal evolution of the kinetic energy for run c. we clearly see the kinetic energy starts to accelerate after @xmath49=0.5 and then increasing as time goes on .",
    "the result in run c indicates that solution is deviating from the nlfff , suggesting it converts into the dynamic phase through the reconnection due to the anomalous resistivity .    in order to confirm this suggestion",
    "we note in previous section , we see the 3d magnetic structure and estimate the twist of the magnetic field lines at @xmath49=1 marked by the vertical dashed line in figure [ f3 ] , which just begins to convert into the dynamic phase . figures [ f4](a ) and ( b ) show the 3d view of the magnetic field at @xmath49=0 _",
    "i.e. , _ nlfff and @xmath49=1 .",
    "the twisted lines in orange at @xmath49=1 look changed slightly from the initial nlfff state even though the overlying field lines surrounding these twisted lines almost keep their original configurations during this period in run c. we further see the distribution of the magnetic twist and 3d magnetic structure in figures [ f4](c ) and ( d ) to understand the more detailed magnetic structure at close to the pil in the central area .",
    "figure [ f4](c ) shows that the most of twist values in nlfff are less than one - turn as discussed in the above section , on the other hand , the strongly twisted lines with more than one - turn are generated at @xmath49=1 as shown in figure [ f4](d ) , indicating the locations of their footpoints marked by dashed circles in upper panel , and showing the field lines traced from there in the lower panel .",
    "interestingly , the locations of these footpoints are close to those of sunquake detected by the helioseismology ( @xcite ) , being triggered at the footpoint of the erupting flux rope at early flare phase .",
    "in addition , the change of the field lines topology from @xmath49=0 to @xmath49=1 allows us to be reminiscent of the tether - cutting reconnection ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    therefore , this results might suggest that the tether - cutting reconnection plays an important role on breaking the equilibrium sate before the flare .",
    "we suggested in above section that the magnetic field with the strongly twisted line over one - turn can break the equilibrium condition and make the nlfff convert into the dynamic phase .",
    "however its time evolution is not consistent in that simulation because the three components of the magnetic field are fixed on the boundaries , which is clearly over condition meaning that the dynamics might be shown properly due to the inconsistent boundary condition . in this section ,",
    "we therefore perform the mhd simulation using the magnetic field shown in figure [ f4](b ) , which is braking the equilibrium state , as an initial condition where the tangential components are released on all the boundaries to discuss its time evolution .",
    "this calculation is called run d. we first show an overview of the 3d dynamics of the magnetic field lines for run d with vertical velocity ( @xmath55 ) in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "this result shows that the twisted field lines with more than half - turn twist , being formed at @xmath562 in figure [ f4](b ) , in orange erupt away from the solar surface even though the tangential components of the magnetic field are released on all the boundaries . because of the release boundary condition , the tangential components are deviating from that of original vector field as time goes , which is relaxing toward them close to the potential field . the nlfff obtained from runs b and c-1",
    "never show these dynamics with the constant resistivity , this result thus indicates that the strongly twisted lines over the one - turn twist formed in nlfff are required in this active region to break the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "we compare these simulation results with observational data obtained from to confirm a reliability of our simulation .",
    "figure [ f6](a ) shows the euv images in 171  taken by aia/_sdo_. figure [ f6](b ) plots the contour of @xmath57 over the aia images .",
    "euv is strongly enhanced at pil between the sunspot located in the central area , on the other hand , it is enhanced too at the location marked by red circle , being away from the central area .",
    "this location corresponds to edge of the negative polarity on the east side in figure [ f6](b ) . from figure [ f5 ]",
    ", we can see that the part of one footpoints of the twisted field lines jump from the central area to the edge of the negative polarity too after @xmath49=2.5 as suggested from figure [ f6 ] .",
    "therefore , these observational results might support our simulation .",
    "next we compare our simulation results with image taken by _",
    "hinode _ satellite .",
    "we focus on investigating the reconnection of only the twisted lines with more than one third ( @xmath58=0.3 ) because @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that these twisted line at close to the pil are related to the two - ribbon flares where the image is strongly enhanced .",
    "in addition to this , in this study we analyze it at early eruptive phase as shown in figure [ f7](a ) because in the late phase the tangential components of the magnetic field on the bottom boundary are deviating gradually from observational one due to the released boundary condition .",
    "following @xcite , the reconnected field lines are estimated using the spatial variance of the field lines connectivity , which is allowed only by the magnetic reconnection .",
    "the formulation is defined by the following equation ; @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a location of one footpoint of each field line at time @xmath61 , which is traced from another footpoint at @xmath62 .",
    "eventually , we calculate @xmath63 where the enhanced region in @xmath64 indicates memories in which the reconnection took place dramatically in the twisted lines .",
    "the left panel in figure [ f7](b ) exhibits the image taken by _",
    "hinode_/sot at the early flare phase and",
    "the middle and right panels show the distribution of @xmath65 at @xmath49=2.0 and @xmath49=4.0 .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of @xmath65 is similar to that of the observed two - ribbon flares seen in the left panel in figure [ f7](b ) .",
    "this result clearly shows that the two - ribbon flare is enhanced due to the reconnection of twisted lines , which is consistent with classical flare models(see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we show the field lines structure after the flare .",
    "figure [ f8](a ) shows the field lines over the flare - ribbons obtained from mhd simulation from which all of field lines are traced .",
    "our simulation shows the post flare loops on the flare ribbons as often seen in observed euv or images .",
    "we compare the simulation results with the euv image with 94  taken by aia/_sdo _ shown in figure [ f8](b ) . before showing",
    "the comparison with the result of mhd simulation , figure [ f8](c ) shows the nlfff after the flare , which is reconstructed from vector field at 03:00 ut on february 15 , plotted over the euv image .",
    "the nlfff almost capture the post flare loops in euv image shown in figure [ f8](b ) . on the other hand , the field lines structure at @xmath49=10 obtained from mhd simulation",
    "slightly deviates from the observed image and looks relaxation compared to those of nlfff . because the tangential components of the magnetic field are released on the bottom boundary , and then being toward close to the potential field",
    "nevertheless , they roughly capturer the euv image and this result would also support the reliability of our simulation .",
    "above section , the mhd simulation showed the twisted lines initially embedded in the lower corona successfully erupt from the solar surface .",
    "however , its still unclear that these twisted lines grow up to the cme or not .",
    "in order to clarify them , we discuss about the decay index profile being related to the torus instability ( @xcite ) , which is an important factor in determining whether the flux tube can escape from the lower corona or not .",
    "the decay index refers to an estimation of a criterion for the torus instability and is given by the following equation : @xmath66 where the threshold is at approximately @xmath67=1.5 ( @xcite ) . because it is difficult to separate an external field from nlfff , following @xcite or @xcite , the decay index on the potential field is plotted in figure [ f9](a ) , marked by a cross in the inset , where the strong twisted lines of nlfff are embedded . from this result ,",
    "the threshold is located at approximately @xmath68 = 0.2 corresponding to 63.2(mm ) .",
    "figure [ f9](b ) shows a time evolution of selected twisted field line with more than half - turn where at @xmath49=0.0 the twisted line exists in the lower area corresponding to less than @xmath68 = 0.2 at the top of the box .",
    "this indicates that the twisted line is stable against the torus instability . on the other hand , as time goes on , these cross over the critical height as a result of the initial eruption",
    ". this result might give an important scenario related to the dynamics of the flare - cme .",
    "we present more detailed temporal evolution of the same selected twisted line in figure [ f9](c ) projecting them at each time on 2d plane with red line tracing a temporal evolution of the loop top .",
    "the dashed line indicates the critical height of the torus instability .",
    "figure [ f9](d ) shows the time variation of the loop top _ i.e. , _ the ascending velocity on appearance with the vertical dashed line where the twisted line is passing the critical height . this result does not exhibit sudden acceleration of the twisted line in this study , as shown in @xcite and @xcite , even though the loop top of the twisted line exceeds the critical height and its velocity looks to being increase slowly after @xmath49=5.0 .",
    "we might point out two causes to bring this problem .",
    "one is that the whole box is not large enough to trace the twisted lines for a long time .",
    "in addition , we set the rigid wall at all the boundaries , which is not able to expel the overlying field lines to the outside of the numerical domain , consequently the magnetic pressure is accumulated close to the boundary due to the twisted lines keep pushing the overlying field lines .",
    "another is due to the bottom boundary condition _",
    "i.e. , _ due to the release of the tangential components .",
    "torus instability is driven by the poloidal field of the flux tube generated by the toroidal current carrying in it . however , the release condition for the tangential components relax the twisted lines , which means that hoop force driving the twisted lines upward is loosing gradually . these two factors",
    "preventing the twisted lines from the acceleration might work effectively on the dynamics of them .",
    "in other word , these twisted lines might have a potential for the solar eruption if settling these problems on the size of numerical box and the boundary condition .",
    "therefore , as prospective work , it is important matter how to fit the three component of the magnetic field obtained from the vector field data consistently into an induction equation , _",
    "i.e. , _ would be required a data - driven simulation as presented in @xcite .",
    "we check the dynamics of depending on the density formula by replacing the equation ( [ eq_den_nlfff ] ) by the equation ( [ eq_den_mhd ] ) where @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 .",
    "this calculation is called run e. figure [ f10](a ) shows a temporal evolution of the kinetic energy for run d and run e , respectively .",
    "both of them are a lot of similar profiles except we can see a little bit deviation at the late phase .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ f10](b ) shows an temporal evolution of the iteration number , which shows that run e requires much more calculation time than that in run d. 3d field lines structure marked by each circle in figure [ f10](a ) are shown in figures [ f10](c ) and ( d ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that the dynamics is almost same between them but the cost performance of run d is much better than run e , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is also agreement with previous works done by @xcite and series of their papers .",
    "we further perform an mhd calculation ( run f ) replacing the anomalous resistivity by constant one to show a dynamics of depending on the resistivity formula too .",
    "figure [ f11](a ) shows a temporal evolution of the maximum value of current density ( = @xmath71 ) measured above 3600(km ) for run d and run f , respectively , which can exclude the strong current density existing close to the photosphere .",
    "although the value of run d initially undergoes sudden decrease and is keeping less than one in run f during the calculation , this sudden decrease is probably due to the diffusive effect derived from the anomalous resistivity . on the other hand , because the critical current set in the anomalous resistivity corresponds to the value 30 , it works around by @xmath49=3 .",
    "nevertheless , temporal evolutions of the kinetic energy for run d and run f shown in figure [ f10](b ) are quite similar profiles although we can see a little bit deviation between them .",
    "furthermore 3d field lines structure and color map of @xmath72 for run d and run e shown in figures [ f10](c ) and ( d ) are almost same too even at @xmath49=5.0 .",
    "form these results , in this case the anomalous resistivity dose not work effectively well on the dynamics while the twisted lines are ascending .",
    "however , note that the reconnection is very important to form the strongly twisted lines in the lower corona to launch from the solar surface , after that it would take place only accompanied with ascending of the twisted lines pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we performed the mhd simulation combined with nlfff and show an overview of the dynamics of the magnetic field at early eruptive phase of the x2.2-class flare , and compared with observational results .",
    "the nlfff is in a stable state against the kink mode instability ( also confirmed by @xcite ) and even any other perturbations as long as reconnection dose not occur in the nlfff . on the other hand",
    ", when the tether - cutting reconnection in nlfff could form the strongly twisted lines with more than one - turn twist , then we found that it plays an important role on breaking the quasi - steady state in nlfff .",
    "consequently the nlfff converts into the dynamic stage and the twisted lines can erupt away from the solar surface .",
    "this scenario is already suggested by the previous studies on analysis of nlfff in ar 11158 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as a result for comparing with the observations , distribution of the observed two - ribbon flares",
    "are explained well by map on the spatial variance of the footpoints due to the reconnection of the twisted lines .",
    "in addition to this , the post flare loops seen in the aia image are captured by the field lines after the reconnection on the mhd simulation .",
    "thus , these results could support the reliability of our simulation results .",
    "however , the some detailed dynamics on the twisted lines have not yet been revealed .",
    "one is that how much dose the flux tube need the magnetic twist just before launching from the solar surface , in order to reach the threshold height of the torus instability . in this study , although only one case ( run d ) was performed and then presented here , we have to investigate the dynamics of another twisted lines having the different twist values initially , which is extended from this study",
    ". then we can expect to find the critical twist leading the torus instability .",
    "another is to reveal the complicated magnetic reconnection while the twisted line is ascending .",
    "the detailed analysis extended from this paper will answer this question definitely .    on the other hand , our simulation left some problems .",
    "although the twisted lines cross over the threshold height of the torus instability , we could not see the sudden acceleration shown in the previous theoretical studies done by _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in order to answer this problem",
    ", we should extend size of the numerical domain , modify or develop an advanced boundary condition fitting the three component of the magnetic field on the photospheric magnetic field consistently into the induction equation , such as a data - driven simulation would be required ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , in this study the triggering reconnection to produce the twisted flux tube is induced by the anomalous resistivity . however , in general , photospheric motion or new emerging flux drives pre - existing strongly twisted lines into the dynamic phase ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "in the future , we must develop a simulation considering this observational information .",
    "doing so will allow further physical insight into the onset and dynamics of flare - cme .",
