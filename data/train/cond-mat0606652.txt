    "toy models of sandpiles are the archetypical examples of self - organized criticality emerging out of time - scale separation @xcite .",
    "sandpile models come in many different flavors ( deterministic or stochastic rules @xcite , discrete or continuous variables @xcite , with or without height restrictions @xcite , etc . ) , but they usually consist in adding grains one by one until a local threshold ( typically a condition on some slope or height ) is reached , triggering a series of redistribution events , i.e. `` avalanches '' , which may lead to dissipation of sandgrains at the open boundaries .",
    "their numerical study is notoriously difficult and first led to a largely unsatisfactory situation in which `` microscopic details '' were believed to influence scaling properties , in contradiction with universality principles @xcite .",
    "major progress in favor of universality came when sandpile criticality was put into the broader context of standard non - equilibrium absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , switching off both dissipation ( open boundaries ) and driving ( slow addition of grains ) , the total amount of sand or `` energy '' is conserved , and becomes a control parameter for these `` fixed energy sandpiles '' . for large amounts of sand ,",
    "the system is in an active phase with never - ending relaxation events , while for small energies it gets trapped with certainty into some absorbing state where all dynamics ceases ( all sites being below threshold ) . separating these two regimes",
    "there is a critical energy which was shown @xcite to coincide with the stationary energy - density in the corresponding original sandpile ( with slow - driving and boundary dissipation ) . in this way",
    ", the exponents characterizing sandpiles can be related to standard critical exponents in an absorbing - state phase transition @xcite ( an alternative route not discussed here is to map sandpiles into standard pinning - depinning interfacial phase transitions ) .    using this approach",
    ", it was determined that stochastic sandpiles @xcite generally do _ not _ belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) class , prominent among absorbing phase transitions , but to the so - called `` conserved - dp '' or manna class ( hereafter c - dp / manna ) characterized by the coupling of activity to a static conserved field directly representing the conservation of sandgrains @xcite .",
    "the field theory or mesoscopic langevin equations describing this class reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the activity field ( characterizing the density of grains above threshold ) , @xmath2 is the locally - conserved energy field , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are parameters and @xmath5 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "equation ( [ sde_manna ] ) represents a robust and well - established universality class including not only stochastic sandpiles , but also some reaction - diffusion systems @xcite    in a recent letter however , mohanty and dhar @xcite have argued that generic sandpile models with `` sticky grains '' or `` inertia '' , where some grains remain stable even if the local threshold is passed , should be in the dp class .",
    "the authors presented convincing numerical and analytical evidence that indeed this is the case for a _ directed _ two - dimensional system , which happens to be mappable into an effective one - dimensional directed site - percolation dynamics .",
    "also , for isotropic ( _ undirected _ ) models with stickiness it was claimed that dp scaling holds .",
    "for this second case the authors presented a monte carlo simulation and , additionally justified their findings by arguing that the `` right '' set of langevin equations for inertial sandpiles should include a coupling of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the heaviside step function and @xmath8 is the instability threshold , substituting the bilinear coupling @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ sde_manna ] ) .",
    "the logic behind such a term is , in principle , reasonable @xcite and it is argued in @xcite that considering this coupling , one should leave the manna universality class and return to dp , i.e. the conservation law should be irrelevant in the presence of `` stickiness '' ( see the schematic diagram in figure @xmath10 of @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that this claim in @xcite is unfounded : even in the presence of inertia / stickiness , the generic universality class of ( undirected ) stochastic sandpiles models remains the c - dp / manna one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first report on extensive simulations of the model studied in @xcite in the fixed - energy ensemble , from which we conclude that isotropic sticky sandpiles are in the c - dp / manna class . in section iii , we integrate the set of langevin equations with a @xmath7 function coupling , which we find to be also in the c - dp / manna class , and we perform a numerical renormalization treatment to show that these langevin equations evolve upon coarse - graining towards eqs.([sde_manna ] ) .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite is a variation of the manna model : a discrete sandpile , defined on a one - dimensional lattice , with a height threshold @xmath11 , slow sand addition and dissipation at the boundaries , but including a ( sticking ) probability @xmath12 for grains to remain stable even if they are above threshold .",
    "here we consider only the limit which possesses a critical point , i.e. the bulk - dissipation rate is set to zero . following the strategy in @xcite",
    ", we analyze the `` fixed energy version '' of the model : we suppress grain addition and boundary dissipation , fix the total energy to @xmath13 , and use @xmath14 as a control parameter . note that , owing to the existence of a non - vanishing sticking probability , arbitrarily large heights are allowed .",
    "active sites ( at which @xmath15 ) are updated in parallel with the toppling occurring with probability @xmath14 .",
    "we have implemented two different versions in which each toppling event redistributes two grains to the two nearest - neighbor sites , either randomly ( stochastic redistribution rule ) or regularly , with one grain onto each neighbor ( deterministic rule ) .",
    "the methodology followed is standard for absorbing phase transitions : first , the critical point is determined by studying the decay of activity from some initial condition varying @xmath14 in a large system : for large @xmath14 values , activity saturates ( active phase ) , while for small @xmath14 activity vanishes ( absorbing phase ) . at the critical point",
    ", separating these two phases , @xmath16 , activity decays asymptotically as a power - law with the critical exponent @xmath17 . for the stochastic and the deterministic rules , we find , respectively , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( fig .  [ f1]a , b ) .",
    "these estimates of @xmath22 are in good agreement with the best evaluations for the manna class in one dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 @xcite , and clearly incompatible with the dp value @xmath24 .    next , using the critical value determined above , the variation of the stationary saturation value of activity at the critical point for smaller system - sizes is recorded . from the expected scaling law @xmath25",
    ", we determine @xmath26 for both the stochastic and the deterministic rule as shown in fig .",

    "we determine @xmath26 for both of them.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]    we have also performed spreading experiments @xcite ( not shown ) by following the standard procedure : we perturb a natural absorbing state ( one generated by the system dynamics ) to generate a small amount of localized activity and analyze how it spreads out at the previously determined critical point .",
    "we measured @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 exponents for the number of active sites , surviving probability , and average square - radius critical , respectively @xcite .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the best estimations for the manna class @xcite and differ from their corresponding dp values ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "after revisiting microscopic sandpile models with sticky grains , their critical behavior appears to be fully compatible with those of the c - dp / manna class .",
    "we now turn to a study of the coupled langevin equations proposed by mohanty and dhar to describe their coarse - grained dynamics .",
    "the stochastic equations proposed in @xcite are eqs .",
    "[ sde_manna ] , _ i.e. _ those of the c - dp / manna class , except for the coupling term @xmath9 which is replaced by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( microscopic ) toppling threshold .",
    "the presence of this microscopic feature and of the step function @xmath7 is surprising in so far as langevin equations are usually understood as resulting from some coarse - graining of microscopic dynamics .",
    "in particular , the step function is unlikely to be a robust mesoscopic description , as it will be modified ( probably transformed into a smoother function ) upon coarse - graining .",
    "discontinuous functions are notoriously difficult in the framework of renormalization group analysis . moreover , even the `` simple '' equations ( [ sde_manna ] ) resist standard perturbative renormalization attempts @xcite .",
    "the only available strategy then is direct numerical integration .",
    "the presence of the ( square - root ) multiplicative noise term makes this a priori difficult @xcite , but this technical difficulty was recently circumvented by the fast and quasi - exact sampling method introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have used this scheme to numerically integrate the equations proposed by mohanty and dhar .",
    "these simulations yielded two sets of results : following the protocol recalled above , we studied the absorbing phase transition observed when varying the linear coefficient .",
    "we also introduced a local effective `` mass '' coefficient @xmath39 and studied its behavior upon coarse - graining in numerical simulations to analyze the relation between the two sets of langevin equations .",
    "starting from an homogeneous , active , initial condition , we studied the time - decay of spatially - averaged activity varying the control parameter @xmath40 .",
    "as expected , algebraic decay is found at the critical value separating exponential decay ( absorbing phase ) from saturation ( active phase ) .",
    "the estimated decay exponent @xmath41 is in perfect agreement with the c - dp / manna class value ( fig .",
    "[ f2]a ) . at the critical point",
    ", @xmath42 , the scaling of the stationary activity for finite size systems yields the estimate @xmath43 , ( fig .",
    "[ f2]b ) again in agreement with the c - dp / manna value . these estimates are thus incompatible with the dp class values .",
    "also , spreading experiments ( not shown ) fully confirm this result .",
    "( other parameter have been fixed as : system size @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , integrated with time - step @xmath50 ) .",
    "( b ) finite size scaling at criticality ( more details in the text).,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]   ( other parameter have been fixed as : system size @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , integrated with time - step @xmath50 ) .",
    "( b ) finite size scaling at criticality ( more details in the text).,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]              the above results are easily understood when observing the behavior of the mohanty - dhar langevin equations coarse - grained numerically . to do this",
    ", we build scatter plots of @xmath51 vs the field difference @xmath52 , where the averages are taken on kadanoff - blocks of length @xmath53 . for @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ f3]a ) , we obviously observe the @xmath7-function form . for @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ f3]b ) , the effective coupling can take intermediate discrete values between @xmath40 and @xmath56 , depending on the number of above - threshold microscopic sites in the block . when the block size is larger and larger ( fig .",
    "[ f3]c , d ) , a smooth function gradually appears . by retaining just the two leading terms in a taylor expansion of such an analytical function around the origin",
    ", we recover , at a coarse - grained level , the langevin equation for the manna class eqs.([sde_manna ] ) , i.e. a linear coupling term and a correction to the linear term , @xmath40 in eqs.([sde_manna ] ) .",
    "higher order terms in the taylor expansion can be argued to be irrelevant from standard naive power counting arguments .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the set of langevin equations including a heaviside @xmath7 function should exhibit the same asymptotic behavior as the original c - dp / manna class langevin equations , eqs.([sde_manna ] ) .",
    "to sum up , introducing `` stickiness '' in isotropic sandpile models does not change their universality class , which remains that of the manna model .",
    "we reached this conclusion via numerical simulations of microscopic models and langevin equations proposed in @xcite .",
    "we showed in addition that these langevin equations `` flow '' towards those of the manna class under some numerical coarse - graining procedure .",
    "one can wonder what is the reason why this conclusion does not hold for the _ directed _ ( or anisotropic ) sandpiles studied also by mohanty and dhar in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which they proved to be in the dp class .",
    "these directed models , defined on a two - dimensional lattice include an isotropic direction and a fully anisotropic one , in the sense that sand goes `` downwards '' in that direction but not `` upwards '' .",
    "this makes it possible to map the problem on dp in @xmath57 dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ the anisotropic dimension can be taken as `` time '' .",
    "the local conservation of energy is present also in these models , but `` local '' here means in `` space - time '' neighborhoods , while _ energy is not conserved _ in the isotropic spatial direction .",
    "hence , manna behavior does not appear , while dp scaling , the usual one in the absence of spatial energy conservation , is expected to emerge , as indeed was proved in @xcite    m.a.m .",

    "the fostering of activity - creation induced by the frozen energy field is at work only if the amount of inactive grains at a given site , @xmath58 , is above some threshold ( i.e. only if a site can become active upon receiving some extra grain ) and , more importantly , this effect saturates : irrespectively of how large the amount of inactive grains ( energy ) at a given site , a fixed maximum amount of activity will be generated upon arrival of activity ( a site topples at most two particles ) .    while these conclusions apply to stochastic sandpiles , in the deterministic bak - tang - wiesenfeld one @xcite the existence of many other conservation laws ( toppling invariants ) makes the situation much more complicated ."
