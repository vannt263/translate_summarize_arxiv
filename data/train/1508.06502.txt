    "kepler _ has allowed for more thorough investigations of host star binarity using the _ kepler _ sample , which is not influenced by the selection bias of radial velocity planet detection surveys ( e.g. , small separation binaries are avoided in radial velocity planet searches ) .",
    "these studies indicate that planet formation is suppressed in multiple - star systems with separations @xmath91500 au ( wang et al .",
    "2014 ) , and hint that stellar multiplicity affects different types of planet formation in different ways ( ngo et al . 2015 ; wang et al .",

    "2005 ) to estimate how many exoplanet host stars in the _ kepler _ field of view are in spatially - resolvable binary systems .",
    "their simulation predicts that most of the sub - arsecond companions detected around",
    "stars with imaging are physically bound to the primary star , meaning that in general ( over the separation range that such observations are sensitive , @xmath100.1 - 1@xmath7 ) exoplanet host stars have a binary fraction similar to that of field stars , @xmath1040 - 50% .",
    "in addition to characterizing the binarity of hosts to exoplanets to learn more about how planets form , particularly small planets like those found by _ kepler _ , detecting companions to _ kepler _ host stars is important for measuring accurate radii of the planets themselves .",
    "it is only with accurate and precise ( to @xmath1020% ; e.g. , rogers 2014 ) radii ( and thus density ) measurements that we can distinguish between `` rocky''/terrestrial and not - rocky / not - earth - like planets .",
    "the large pixel size ( @xmath104@xmath7@xmath114@xmath7 ) , aperture , and centroiding algorithm of the _ kepler _ pipeline still allow for false positives and blended stars to introduce dilution to transit measurements , resulting in underestimates of planetary radii and overstimates of planetary density .",
    "this issue spurred a dedicated and expansive community follow - up program to the space - based _ kepler _ observations , including spectroscopy and high - resolution imaging to detect false positives and close companions , to confirm the exoplanets and refine their host star parameters ( e.g. , howell et al .",

    "2015 ) fit isochrones , based on the stellar parameters from the nasa exoplanet archive , to each potential host star in the cumulative _ kepler _ candidate list and calculated for each the possible factor by which the orbiting planet radii are underestimated , assuming five different multiple - star scenarios ( e.g. , planet orbits primary star , planet orbits secondary star , planet orbits tertiary star , etc . ) .",
    "their resulting radius correction factor  the degree to which planetary radii are underestimated based on the presence of undeteted stars",
    " varies for each system and for each multiplicity scenario , but the overall mean correction factor for stars observed by _ kepler _ with no follow - up observations is 1.49@xmath120.12 .",
    "the mean correction factor for stars with typical follow - up observations ( 2 - 3 radial velocity measurements over 6 - 9 months , spectroscopy of the primary star , and high resolution imaging in at least one filter ) is reduced to 1.2@xmath120.06 , illustrating how crucial such observations are to understanding the basic characteristics of detected planets .",
    "traditionally , spectroscopy and imaging follow - up of kois have been used to probe different parameter spaces of companions , spectroscopy being important for detecting tight binaries and imaging being more relevant for wider bound companions as well as chance background stars .",
    "recently , kolbl et al . ( 2015 ; k15 ) introduced a new technique for detecting close companions to kois using _ keck / hires _ spectroscopy originally purposed for measuring radial velocities of planets ( and thus their masses ) and/or close stellar companions . in this paper",
    ", we aim to refine the answer to the question , _ do the spectroscopic and imaging techniques detect the same or different stars ? _ specifically , we compare the properties of companions detected by k15 using spectroscopy and companions detected by various high - contrast imaging _ kepler _ follow - up campaigns , to see whether the two methods overlap in their detection rates and characterization of detected companions .",
    "k15 present a method for detecting close companions to kois , many of which host planet candidates that still require validation .",
    "k15 search through the california _ kepler _ survey s catalog of 1160 single - epoch , high resolution optical _ keck i / hires _ spectra of kois for evidence of more than one set of stellar absorption lines .",
    "they systematically test whether each individual spectrum is best represented as the sum of two or more input spectra drawn from an extensive library of model spectra spanning the h - r diagram . from their analysis , k15 detect companions to 63 kois , and provide effective temperatures ( t@xmath0 ) and flux ratios ( f@xmath1/f@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the primary and @xmath4 is the companion ) measured across the @xmath13 bands for each companion . as with any detection method of close - in companions to stars , k15 s spectroscopic `` contamination '' detection method has caveats that are described in more detail in that work .",
    "briefly , k15 are only sensitive to companions that fall within the slit , which corresponds to distances 0.43 - 1.5@xmath7 from the primary star .",
    "they assume in their model - fitting process that the primary star is on the main sequence , and their model templates fall between 3200 and 6500 k. their library of companion star templates contains members between 3300 and 6100 k , but it does not contain a representative median spectrum between 3800 and 3900 k. the k15 code can not detect companion stars with @xmath14rvs  the relative radial velocity between primary star and the potential companion(s )  less than 10 km / s , and is limited to companions with orbital periods @xmath152.5 days , corresponding to the maximum detectable doppler shift of @xmath12200 km / s .",
    "( there is an exception for m dwarfs orbiting g - type primary stars , explained below . )",
    "furthermore , if the primary and companion spectral types are similar and their relative rv is low ( @xmath9 20 km / s ) , the flux of the companion star can be underestimated if some of its flux is subtracted away with that of the primary star in the k15 analysis .",
    "this can in turn decrease the calculated flux ratio for the two stars .    in general ,",
    "the k15 method is able to detect companion stars with as small a spectral contribution as 0.5%-1% of primary star s flux .",
    "their method is most accurate for companions with a @xmath14rv @xmath16 10 km / s , a @xmath1720% flux contribution , and when both primary and companion stars have 3000 k@xmath17t@xmath186000 k. their injection - recovery tests that paired actual spectra of their sample with the designated companion star shifted by @xmath14rv + 50 kms@xmath19 indicate a range of recovery rates depending on primary vs. companion t@xmath0 and % of total flux contributed by the companion ( see their table 2 ) . for the synthetic binary cases where the k15 algorithm recovered the companion star ,",
    "its predicted temperature and flux ratio in the visible also vary in their accuracy ( see their table 5 ) , e.g. , the largest @xmath20 ( 950 k ) occurs in a 3500 k primary+6000 k companion system in which the companion contributes 1% of the total flux , and the largest @xmath21 ( 0.55 ) occurs in both a 5500 k primary+5500 k companion system and a 3500 k primary+5000k companion system , in which the companion contributes 1% of the total flux",
    ".    k15 test more thoroughly cases of g - type primaries ( 5500 k)+ m - dwarf companions ( 3500 k ) with @xmath14rv@xmath225 kms@xmath19 and companion flux contributions of 1% , 3% , or 5% of the total flux .",
    "the recovery rate for companion stars with 3% or 5% of the total flux is 90% , whereas the recovery rate for companions with 1% of the total flux drops to 40% .",
    "similarly , the deduced t@xmath0 differs more from the actual t@xmath0 as the flux contribution of the companion star decreases , although the deduced versus actual percentage flux decreases with decreasing % flux of the companion ( see their table 6 ) .",
    "when the m dwarf contributes 0.5% of the total flux , at a @xmath14rv of 50 kms@xmath19 , the detection rate is also 40% , but no fainter companions ( at 0.05% or 0.1% of the total flux ) are recovered .    in  4.2.1 and  4.2.2",
    ", we examine how different limitations of the observations an analysis between the spectroscopic detection methods and the imaging detections methods ( which will be discussed in the next section ) influence the derived companion parameters .",

    "sky frames were constructed for each target from the target frames themselves by median filtering and coadding the dithered frames .",
    "each dither pattern frame was then sky subtracted and flatfielded . individual exposures per frame varied depending on the brightness of the target but typically were 10  30 seconds per frame , yielding photometry on the primary target from the final coadded dither pattern of @xmath23 .",
    "data reduction was performed with a custom set of idl routines .",
    "aperture photometry was used to obtain the relative magnitudes of stars for those fields with multiple sources .",
    "point source detection limits were estimated in a series of concentric annuli drawn around the star .",
    "the separation and widths of the annuli were set to the fwhm of the primary target point spread function .",
    "the standard deviation of the background counts is calculated for each annulus , and the @xmath24 limits are determined within annular rings ( see also adams et al .",

    "( 2011 ) and howell et al .",
    "however , a brief description is warranted here .",
    "from the raw data , we form the autocorrelation and triple correlation of each data frame , sum these over the entire frame sequence , and then fourier transform these to obtain the total spatial frequency power spectrum and total spatial frequency bispectrum of the observation . to calculate a reconstructed image of the target , we deconvolve the power spectrum with that of a bright unresolved star observed in the same way , close in time and in sky position to that of the binary star .",
    "( in the fourier domain , the deconvolution is performed by dividing the power spectrum of the binary with that of the point source . ) taking the square root of this function , we obtain the modulus of the object s fourier transform .",
    "on the other hand , the bispectrum contains information that allows for the calculation of the phase of the object s fourier transform , which we estimated using the method of meng et al .",
    "the modulus and phase are combined , the result is low - pass filtered to suppress noise above the diffraction limit , and then it is inverse - fourier transformed to arrive at the reconstructed image . the same process is used for the data stacks in both filters resulting in reconstructed images for each color .",
    "the reconstructed images are then visually inspected for companions .",
    "if a companion is found in both images ( which is the case for the objects here ) , then the approximate position relative to the primary star is noted from the reconstructed image , and used as the starting position for a downhill simplex fitting routine to obtain the final differential astrometry and photometry of the system . however , the fitting is done to the deconvolved power spectrum , where the signature of a companion is a fringe pattern ( i.e. a cosine squared function ) .",
    "the spacing , orientation , and fringe depth are uniquely determined by the separation , position angle , and magnitude difference of the binary star .",
    "dssi was used at the _ gemini _ north telescope in july of 2014 . at _ gemini",
    "_ , the plate scale is 0.011 arcsec pixel@xmath19 , and often the camera is windowed to a smaller pixel region ( e.g. , 256x256 , or 2.8x2.8@xmath7 ) .",
    "the diffraction - limited resolution at _ gemini _ is 0.016@xmath7 at 500 nm and 0.025@xmath7 at 800 nm ( horch et al .",

    "2059 was observed on two dates on that run , namely 19 july and 24 july while koi 3471 was only observed once , on 24 july .",
    "the data collection was similar to _ wiyn _ observations in terms of number of frames and data collection in 1000-frame subsets , but the frame exposure time used at _ gemini _ was 60 ms , which is longer that that used at _ wiyn _ owing to the better average seeing conditions at _ gemini _ versus _ wiyn_. this means that the correlation time of the atmosphere is longer at _ gemini _ , and therefore the speckle lifetimes on the image plane are also longer .",
    "we also store the data from _ gemini _ in larger arrays than _ wiyn _ , 256x256 pixel frames for _ gemini _ versus 128x128 pixels for _",
    "wiyn_. this is needed since the magnification of the images is higher than what we use at _ wiyn _ in order to sample the ( diffraction - limited ) speckles properly at the larger aperture",

    "the overall sample of kois with spectroscopy versus the sample with imaging observations is different  the former is generally limited to brighter stars ( and is rather complete at kepler magnitudes @xmath1714.2 ) , since the observations necessarily disperse the light  and the techniques provide different information , e.g. , astrometry can only be derived from imaging observations . for many kois ,",
    "only one type of observation is available , so it is important to understand how this limitation affects the detection rate and characterization of close companions .",
    "here we examine a unique sample of eleven kois that have companions detected from both the spectroscopic deblending method of k15 and nir / ao and/or speckle imaging .",
    "our goal is to determine whether the companions detected by k15 are the same companions detected by the imaging efforts , or whether each technique uncovers a completely separate sample of companion stars .",

    "the directly - measured quantities from imaging data are separation , position angle , and @xmath14 m ( @xmath14magnitude ) . combining the measured @xmath14 m values ( and when available , multiple colors ) of the imaging - detected companions with the known properties of the primary kois , we attempt to derive companion t@xmath0 values and primary - to - companion flux ratios for each of the companions to kois listed in table 1 .    using differential photometry , it is possible to calculate companion effective temperatures via isochrone fitting techniques ( specifically , by shifting primary star properties down an isochrone to derive companion parameters ) . however , this analysis relies on the assumption that the companion star is physically bound , and should lie along the same isochrone as the primary star .",
    "this assumption can only be assessed in the case of multi - filter photometry , with which we can construct a color - magnitude diagram and empirically test whether the two stars are consistent with the same set of isochrones . in the following sections , we describe the isochrone - fitting process by which we attempt to determine whether the observed imaging companions are gravitationally bound , and thus whether their derived effective temperatures are accurate .",

    "examined individually , and utilizing contrast curves , isochrone `` mapping '' of the imaging observations , and the measured separations of imaging - detected companions , the differences between parameters from the two techniques can be explained by :    1 .",
    "limitations in both techniques to specific @xmath77 ( separation ) ranges  too far away for spectroscopy or too close for imaging  often meaning that the techniques actually detect different stars around each koi 2 .",
    "limitations in the k15 parameter derivation method , such as the sparsity of cool stars in their stellar model grid , large uncertainty in derived parameters when the flux or spectral type of the primary koi and the companion(s ) are very similar , and @xmath14rv constraints , as described in  2.1 .",
    "the assumption that the companion is bound to the primary koi in the derivation of companion parameters from the imaging data  in some cases this assumption is likely incorrect , resulting in spurious imaging - detected companion t@xmath0 values and f@xmath1/f@xmath2 ratios .",
    "this limitation is ameliorated by multi - color imaging of the companion , as described in  3.1 .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclusions regarding agreement between the two techniques for each koi companion considered here in table [ tab3 ] . based on our analysis ,",
    "we can now help answer the following questions :    * can spectroscopy find stars that imaging does not find ? * yes  as expected , very close - in companions ( e.g. , @xmath60.02@xmath7 - 0.05@xmath7 ) are not easily detectable with imaging . the different parameters of the companions detected by k15 versus those detected in imaging data around kois 652 , 2311 , and 3161 are most likely explained by a small separation for the k15-detected companions  the imaging observations are not detecting a very close - in companion that k15 detect .",
    "* can imaging find stars that spectroscopy does not find ? * yes ",
    "bound companions to kois at close separations ( @xmath780.02 - 0.05@xmath7 ) , companions that are likely unbound at @xmath161@xmath7 separation ( e.g. , companions to kois 652 and 2311 ) , and/or companions with small @xmath14rv signals ( e.g. , kois 1613 and 2059 ) , are difficult to detect , and derive precise parameters for , using spectroscopic deblending .",
    "note that imaging data measures @xmath790.2@xmath7 for koi 1613 s companion , and @xmath790.4@xmath7 for koi 2059 s companion ; these would not be detected without high - contrast imaging observations ( they would not be detected in 2mass data , for example ) .",
    "imaging observations are able to detect companions at larger @xmath14 m and @xmath14spt than spectroscopy , and provide real measured fluxes , position angles , and angular separations of companions . due to intrinsic and acknowledged limitations of the spectroscopic deblending technique",
    ", it also does not perform well when the primary star is off the main sequence ( potentially koi 3471 ) , or has very cool or very hot t@xmath0 ( koi 1452 ) , no matter what the temperature or flux contribution of the companion .",
    "* when are they likely to agree ?",
    "* the techniques are most likely to agree when the separation of the companion(s ) is @xmath790.1 - 0.8@xmath7 , the secondary has f@xmath1/f@xmath801 - 20% , both the primary and companion(s ) are not too hot ( t@xmath816000 k ) or too cool ( t@xmath814000 k ) , and the @xmath14rv between the primary and companion is @xmath1610 km  s@xmath19 . our work indicates that the k15 spectroscopic deblending technique and imaging observations may be detecting the same companion around kois 5 and 1361 .",
    "there are four kois in our sample for which the spectroscopic and imaging parameters do not agree , but the reason is not clear ( kois 1152 , 1613 , and 2813 , 3471 ) . in the cases of kois 1152 and 2813 ,",
    "more colors of imaging data , and the smaller separations probed by _ keck ii / nirc2 _ or _ gemini / dssi _ data , would help assess whether the imaging - detected companion is bound or not , and thus help determine the likelihood of it being the same companion as detected by k15 . in the case of koi 1613 , more wavelength coverage of imaging data may help better constrain the imaging - derived companion parameters , but the k15 technique is limited by the system s @xmath14rv and , at present , can only provide upper limits on t@xmath0 and f@xmath1/f@xmath2 . in the case of koi 3471 , the ambiguity in the primary star parameters , the blended nature of the primary , and the multiple k15-detected companions make a meaningful comparison with the imaging results challenging .",
    "the spectroscopic deblending technique for detecting close - in companions to kois , described in detail in k15 , may find companions at smaller separations than high - contrast imaging .",
    "however , the derived properties from this method are often uncertain , and the method is limited in the types of stars and companion configurations it can detect , as well as the information it can provide .",
    "thus , high - contrast ao and speckle imaging provide an important complement , detecting a wider range of companion types , at a larger range of separations , around fainter stars .",
    "our study illustrates why both techniques are needed to fully characterize koi multiplicity and contamination , and can be used to test models of binaries in the _ kepler _ field that could help better predict the number of undetected binary host stars .",
    "our study also shows the utility in combining techniques  in several cases ( kois 1152 , 1613 , 2059 , 2813 , 3161 , 3471 ) the combination of both techniques may indicate possible triple or higher - order multiple systems , with one companion detected with imaging observations and one / more companion(s ) detected spectroscopically .",
    "more astrometry , wheather form speckle ( common proper motions ) or _ gaia _ could help distinguish these cases .",
