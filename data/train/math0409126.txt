    "in the last years we have seen an increasing interest in tropical geometry .",
    "introductory papers in tropical geometry may be found by the interested reader in richter - gebert et al .",
    "@xcite , the specific chapter in the book of sturmfels @xcite or the survey due to mikhalkin @xcite . in the last reference @xcite",
    ", g. mikhalkin applies tropical geometry to enumerative geometry , proving a new way to calculate gromov - witten invariants in the projective plane .",
    "these invariants can be used to count the number of curves , with given genus and degree , passing through a configuration of points .",
    "this method was first suggested by kontsevitch and it is also approached from another point of view in @xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite , we can find some computations of bounds for the welschinger invariant in several toric surfaces using tropical geometry , which are interpreted as the algebraic count of real rational curves through a real configuration of points .",
    "moreover , we can see an application of tropical geometry to combinatorics in @xcite .",
    "thus we observe that tropical geometry is a powerful tool to study different branches of mathematics .",
    "the problem is that it is not easy to translate familiar geometric definitions to a tropical framework",
    ".    this paper deals with the specific problem of successfully translating pappus theorem to a suitable tropical state , using the notion of stable intersection and stable join , as presented in @xcite .",
    "a more systematic study of tropical constructions and their relationship with classical ones is treated in @xcite .",
    "we will work on the tropical semiring @xmath0 , the set of real numbers with the tropical addition @xmath1 and the tropical product @xmath2 . in @xcite and other references ,",
    "it is also used the tropical semiring @xmath3 instead .",
    "but it is straightforward to check that all the results can be translated from one point of view to the other using the isomorphism @xmath4 .",
    "now , we present the objects that we will work with . given a tropical polynomial @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we define the _ tropical variety associated with _",
    "@xmath8 as the set @xmath9 _ is attained for at least two different _ @xmath10 .",
    "that is , the set of points where @xmath8 is not differentiable .    in the following",
    ", we will use homogeneous coordinates in the tropical space @xmath11 , representing the point @xmath12 by @xmath13 $ ] , with the identification @xmath14=[\\alpha\\odot y_1:\\ldots:\\alpha\\odot y_{n+1}]= [ \\alpha + y_1:\\ldots : \\alpha+ y_{n+1}]$ ] , @xmath15 .",
    "we recover the affine coordinates using the usual subtraction ( there is no notion of tropical subtraction ) , @xmath16 = ( y_1-y_{n+1 } , \\ldots , y_n - y_{n+1})$ ] .",
    "we use homogeneous coordinates because it is easier to state cramer s rule in this context .    in this direction , let us remark that the simplest well known varieties are tropical lines in the plane . for instance , take @xmath17 a linear homogeneous polynomial .",
    "the corresponding tropical line in @xmath18 is the set @xmath19 $ ] such that @xmath20 or @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "we obtain three rays emerging from the point @xmath23 $ ] , with vectors in the directions @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "now we arrive to the following problem . what should be considered as the intersection of two given lines or , more generally , the intersection of tropical hypersurfaces .",
    "it is not trivial , as it may happen that two different lines share an infinite number of points , see figure ( [ interinfinita ] ) .",
    "( 70,80 ) ( 0,40)(1,0)50 ( 25,40)(0,-1)40 ( 25,40)(1,1)40 ( 50,40)(0,-1)40 ( 50,40)(1,1)40 ( 0,40)(1,0)25    an answer is the following : given two tropical lines , there exists only one point in the intersection such that it is stable ( in some sense ) under small perturbations of the two lines , see @xcite .",
    "this distinguished point is called the _ stable intersection _ of the lines . similarly , given two points ,",
    "there is only one line that passes through the two given points and is stable under small perturbation of the two points , it is called _ the stable line _ or the _ stable join _ of the points .",
    "both stable intersection and stable join can be computed using the tropical analog of cramer s rule , as follows .",
    "first , the tropical determinant of a given @xmath27 matrix in @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 suppose now a tropical linear system of @xmath30 equations in @xmath31 homogeneous variables is given .",
    "we write @xmath32 the @xmath33 matrix of coefficients and denote by @xmath34 the matrix resulting from deleting the @xmath35-th column of @xmath32 .",
    "then , it is shown in @xcite that the point @xmath36 $ ] is not only a common point of the @xmath30 hyperplanes , but the only one which is stable under small perturbations in the coefficients of the hyperplanes .",
    "therefore , this version of cramer s rule is the right tool that gives us the stable intersection of @xmath30 hyperplanes in the tropical space @xmath11 . the reader might guess that it is also the tool to compute the stable join of @xmath30 points , as this problem can also be seen as solving a regular linear system of equations , the unknowns are the coefficients @xmath37 of the linear equation defining the hyperplane @xmath38 and the row entries of the matrix that represent the system are the ( homogeneous ) coordinates of the given @xmath30 points .",
    "another definition of tropical hypersurfaces may be taken as starting point following the idea that tropical varieties are non - archimedean amoebas .",
    "after gelfand , kapranov and zelevinski @xcite , an amoeba is the image by the logarithmic function of an algebraic variety in @xmath39 . as it is usual in tropical geometry , we will work instead with the field @xmath40 of `` puiseux '' series with complex coordinates and real exponents .",
    "its elements are formal series @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a countable set contained in a finite number of arithmetic sequences .",
    "moreover we use , over @xmath40 , its non - archimedian valuation in order to define our amoebas .    for this purpose",
    "we define in @xmath40 the application @xmath44 , @xmath45 , ( i.e. minus the order of the puiseux series ) .",
    "what we obtain is , in fact , an application @xmath46 onto our tropical semiring .",
    "this application satisfies that @xmath47 and @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "now , let @xmath50 be an algebraic variety in the algebraic torus @xmath51 .",
    "the result of applying @xmath52 component - wise over @xmath50 , @xmath53 is called , by definition , _ an algebraic tropical variety _ and also the _ tropicalization _ of @xmath50 .",
    "conversely , for an algebraic tropical variety @xmath54 , a _ lift of @xmath54 _ is any algebraic variety @xmath50 such that @xmath55 .",
    "let us remark that we have given two different definitions of tropical hypersurfaces : first , as the variety @xmath56 associated to a tropical polynomial @xmath8 ; second , as the tropicalization @xmath57 of an algebraic hypersurface @xmath58 .",
    "the following theorem of kapranov @xcite shows that the two different points of view yield , for hypersurfaces , the same subsets .",
    "precisely , let @xmath59 be a polynomial in @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be the corresponding tropical polynomial .",
    "then , @xmath56 equals @xmath64 .",
    "notice that this theorem does not hold for general varieties , not even for complete intersections .",
    "it is easy to find examples of varieties such that @xmath65 ( for some examples , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , in order to study this situation with more detail one possible way is trying to enlarge the set of defining equations for the algebraic variety so that its tropicalization coincides with the intersection of the tropicalization of the given equations ( see @xcite for the particular case of linear varieties ) .",
    "another possibility , that we will follow here , is to restrict the intersection of tropical hypersurfaces to the particularly meaningful subset of stable points .",
    "correspondingly , a classical theorem of elementary geometry can be regarded in at least two different ways : first , describing by algebraic equations its hypotheses and thesis .",
    "second , as a collection of construction steps with geometric entities .",
    "this duality appears in @xcite , where two versions of pappus theorem are presented , showing that the tropicalization of the algebraic translation of the hypotheses does not yield the thesis without adding extra polynomial equations ( thus obtaining a tropical basis of the hypotheses ideal ) in order to have a correct translation to the tropical case .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite formulates a conjecture about the validity of the straightforward translation to the tropical context of a constructive version of pappus theorem . here",
    ", of course , one must keep up , without modification in the tropical framework , with the given collection of construction steps .",
    "the goal of this paper is precisely to prove this conjecture .",
    "let us introduce some notation needed to state it .",
    "first of all , using duality , we identify the line @xmath66 with the point @xmath67 $ ] in @xmath18 .",
    "the origin of the rays of the line defined by the polynomial is the point @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "now , if we have two lines @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] , then the stable intersection corresponds to the point : @xmath69 $ ] , which is the stable solution of the system @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "also , if we have two points @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] , the previous expression corresponds to the coordinates of the stable line defined by those points .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , we define the cross product of two points @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] as @xmath74,\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as the intersection of two lines or as finding the line through two points , depending on the context .    with this terminology theorem [ pappus ]",
    "states that there exists a tropical construction such that given five points @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 in the tropical plane , it computes three additional points @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and nine lines @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 such that the hole set of elements is always in pappus position ( in the sense of @xcite ) and hence , the intersection of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 is not empty .",
    "remark that in the thesis of the theorem , we do not mean that the three lines @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 share a point that is stable under perturbations but just that their intersection is non empty .    in our approach to proving this theorem",
    "it is essential to understand the behavior of cramer s rule . in @xcite ,",
    "cramer s rule is analyzed using generic small perturbations in the coefficients of the system .",
    "our point of view is a little bit different , as we try to compare the performance of cramer s rule under the valuation map @xmath52 .",
    "this allows us to give sufficient conditions for a chain of computations of tropical determinants to be lifted to the puiseux series field .",
    "using this lift , we are able to derive results from the classical to the tropical context .",
    "the main idea is to take the input elements for the geometric construction in the tropical space , make a lift to the projective space over the puiseux series field and perform there the given construction using classical cramer s rule .",
    "then we prove that , in this particular construction , if the elements in the lift are taken general enough , the results given by the application of cramer s rule in the projective ambient should correspond with those obtained applying cramer s rule in the tropical case .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure does not hold for other constructions , see counterexample [ ejemplociclo ] .",
    "in fact , we can ensure that the good behavior in pappus case happens because our construction is of a very particular kind .",
    "namely , we will prove that tropical and projective constructions behave well with respect to tropicalization when a certain graph associated with the construction is a tree .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we will study with detail the relation between classical and tropical constructions , including a new proof ( [ pseudocramerlema ] ) of cramer s rule .",
    "then , we associate a graph to a tropical construction ( [ grafo ] ) and we introduce the notion of a _ tropically admissible _ construction of an elements ( [ tropadm ] ) . finally we state ( [ levantamientogeneral ] ) the validity of the specialization of a chain of cramer s rule computations to the tropical space , when the construction graph is a tree .",
    "section 3 is devoted to prove the conjectured version of pappus theorem ( [ pappus ] ) , including some comments and remarks .",
    "we conclude ( section 4 ) with some reflections on the difficulty of achieving more general results on this topic .",
    "by a _ geometric construction in the classical case _ we will understand an abstract procedure consisting of    * input data : a finite number of points or lines in @xmath92 that will eventually specialize to concrete elements given by its homogeneous coordinates ( in the case of lines , the coordinates of the corresponding point in the dual plane ) .",
    "* allowed steps : computing the * * line passing through two points * * intersection point of two lines .",
    "* output : a finite set of points and lines    likewise a _ geometric construction in the tropical plane _ consists of a similar procedure , replacing in the steps above the `` line through two points '' by the `` stable line passing through two points '' and the `` intersection of two lines '' by the `` stable intersection of two lines '' .",
    "we want to study the relation between a given construction in the classical setting and the corresponding tropical one , see @xcite for a more general study of tropical geometric constructions .",
    "namely , we want to analyze , for different constructions , the commutativity of the following diagram : @xmath93 where @xmath52 stands for the tropicalization mapping .",
    "that is , given a construction , we want to study when , for some given tropical input data , we are able to find a suitable lift of the input data to the puiseux series field @xmath40 , perform the construction in that projective plane , tropicalize all the output elements and find out that they are exactly the elements obtained by the tropical construction .",
    "we will soon notice that it is not always possible . even if it holds for some constructions , it will not do for every choice of an input lift ( example [ restricciones ] ) .",
    "let us start with the simplest case of one step constructions involving cramer s rule only once .    for a puiseux series @xmath94 , @xmath95",
    ", we will denote by @xmath96 the _ principal coefficient _ of the series .",
    "let @xmath97 be a @xmath27 matrix in @xmath98 .",
    "let us start by studying conditions for the commutativity of tropicalization and determinant computation , i.e. establishing when computing the determinant of @xmath99 and tropicalizing it equals the determinant of @xmath100 .",
    "first , it can be easily checked ( @xcite ) that this this equality does not hold in general .",
    "now , we will show that the conditions to have this property can be expressed in terms of the principal coefficients of the entries of @xmath99 .    in this context",
    "we need to introduce the following terminology .",
    "[ pseudodeterminante ] let @xmath101 be a @xmath27 matrix with coefficients in @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath102 be a @xmath103 matrix in a ring @xmath104 .",
    "we denote by @xmath105 the tropical determinant of @xmath32 and we define @xmath106 the _ pseudo - determinant of @xmath107 _ with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "[ pseudodeterminantelema ] let @xmath97 be a matrix in @xmath98 , @xmath108 the matrix of principal coefficients in @xmath99 and @xmath32 the tropicalization matrix of @xmath99 , @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 , then the principal coefficient of @xmath111 , @xmath112 equals @xmath113 .",
    "moreover @xmath114 coincides with the tropical determinant @xmath105 .",
    "notice that in the expansion of @xmath111 , the permutations @xmath115 , where the order of the corresponding summand @xmath116 is the smallest possible one , are exactly the permutations in the expansion of @xmath105 where @xmath105 is attained .",
    "so , the coefficient of the term @xmath117 is @xmath113 .",
    "if it is non zero , then the order of @xmath111 is @xmath118 .",
    "now , we can extend this lemma to the context of cramer s rule .",
    "[ pseudocramer ] let @xmath101 be a @xmath119 tropical matrix .",

    "[ pseudocramerlema ] suppose we are given a linear equation system in the semiring @xmath28 , with @xmath30 equations in @xmath123 homogeneous variables .",

    "[ consunpaso ] if we have a one step construction , namely the stable join of two points or the stable intersection of two lines , then for every specialization of the input data , there exists a concrete lift that makes diagram ( [ diagrama ] ) commutative .",
    "lemma [ pseudocramerlema ] gives us sufficient conditions in the principal coefficients of the input elements lift to assure that the diagram is commutative .",
    "as the pseudodeterminants are nonzero polynomials , there is always a possible choice of coordinates that makes all pseudodeterminants nonzero .",
    "lemma [ pseudocramerlema ] is not only useful to compute the intersection of @xmath30 hyperplanes in @xmath11 , but it is also valid , for example , to compute the stable plane conic through five points , as it can be also interpreted as finding the stable intersection of 5 hyperplanes in the space of tropical plane conics @xmath127 .",

    "their intersection is the set @xmath130\\",

    "if we perform , as above , tropical cramer s rule on these data , we obtain the point @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "this is the limit of the unique intersection point under small generic perturbations of the tropical lines .",

    "we apply the notation of [ pseudodeterminante ] over the first coordinate data , yielding : + @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "thus , if @xmath138 , then the intersection point will tropicalize to @xmath139=[-2:3:0]$ ] .",
    "but if @xmath140 , we can not know what the tropicalization of the intersection is , since it depends on the series higher order terms that we have not written .",
    "we only know that they will be of the form @xmath141 $ ] , @xmath142",
    ". it can even be the case that the intersection has its first coordinate equals to 0 . in this case",
    "there will be no tropicalization of the intersection at all",
    ".    therefore we can not expect , in general , that the tropicalization of the generators of an ideal will describe the tropicalization of the variety this ideal generates .",
    "now we proceed with the case of more complicated constructions .",
    "namely , for those constructions such that some elements are computed from previously constructed elements . in this respect the following notation and lemmas are useful .",
    "[ grafo ] given a linear geometric construction , we associate a graph to every element @xmath143 of the construction , that is , to all the points and lines appearing at some step of the construction , including input , intermediate and output elements .",

    "we link every element with the elements from which it is constructed directly .",
    "that is , if point @xmath83 ( respectively line @xmath83 ) is the intersection of points @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( respectively the join of points @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , then we write edges @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we call this graph the _ construction graph of @xmath143_.    for instance , the construction graph of and input element consists in just one point representing the element .",

    "[ tropadm ] we say that the construction of an element @xmath143 is _ tropically admissible ( by cramer s rule ) _ if its associated construction graph is a tree .",
    "in general , given a tropical construction and some concrete input data , we will study the possible lifts of these input elements to the projective setting , by parametrizing the principal coefficients of the corresponding series with different variables .",

    "this lemma means that , as the polynomials @xmath202 are never identically zero , there is always a suitable choice of the principal coefficients of the series involved in a lift such that the tropicalization of this lift agrees with the performed step of the tropical construction .",

    "theorem [ levantamientogeneral ] asserts that , for every tropical geometric construction and for every input data , if the construction graph of every element is a tree , then there exists a lift that agrees with our tropical construction , no matter what the input data is . also , it is remarkable that this theorem is stated in general dimension , not just in the plane .",
    "so the result is valid for constructions in @xmath11 , the only restriction we have to consider is that of constructions involving only the stable intersection of @xmath30 hyperplanes and the stable join of @xmath30 points .",
    "the following example shows what may happen if the construction graph is not a tree and we are not in the situation of theorem [ levantamientogeneral ]    [ ejemplociclo ] suppose we are given @xmath228 three points in the plane .",
    "let @xmath229 , @xmath230 be the lines through these points and @xmath231 .",
    "the construction of @xmath232 and @xmath233 is tropically admissible by cramer s rule , but not the construction of @xmath234 , because we have the cycle @xmath235 .",
    "the problem is that we have used twice the point @xmath83 in order to construct @xmath234 .",
    "firstly it is used in the construction of @xmath232 and then in the construction of @xmath233 .",
    "so , after specialization , we may have some algebraic relations making a pseudo - determinant identically zero for every lift . for example , we take @xmath236 $ ] , @xmath237 $ ] , @xmath238 $ ] .",
    "tropically , the construction yields @xmath239=1\\odot x\\oplus 0\\odot y\\oplus 1\\odot z$ ] , @xmath240=3\\odot x\\oplus 0\\odot y\\oplus 3\\odot z$ ] and finally @xmath241=[0:1:0]\\neq a$ ] .",
    "but , for every lift of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 such that the construction is well defined , the final element must be the lift of @xmath83 .",
    "these lifts take the form @xmath242 $ ] , @xmath243 $ ] , @xmath244 $ ] , where terms of bigger degree in the series do not affect the result . in this case ,",
    "@xmath245 $ ] and @xmath246 $ ] which tropicalize correctly to @xmath232 and @xmath233 ( as expected , because the construction graphs of @xmath232 and @xmath233 are trees ) .",
    "now , we want to construct @xmath247 . here , @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "now it is easy to see that @xmath250 .",
    "in fact , @xmath247 must be @xmath251 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath84 and @xmath85 as in the example ( which are points in general position ) the same lifting problem appears for all @xmath252 $ ] with @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "so the above example is not at all an isolated case and it can not be avoided by perturbations of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these bad conditioned cases arrive frequently when we are working with non trivial constructions .",
    "so if we want to chain several simple constructions we have to take these cases into account , requiring some conditions on the construction graph as formulated in the hypothesis of our theorem .",

    "using theorem [ levantamientogeneral ] , we will now proof the validity of the constructive version of pappus theorem proposed in @xcite    let us start with the following specific lemma .",
    "[ pappuslema ] if @xmath255 projective lines over the field of puiseux series @xmath256 have a common point in the projective plane , then the tropicalizations of all the lines contain a common point in the tropical plane .",
    "the intersection point in the projective plane can not be one of @xmath257,\\ [ 0:1:0],\\ [ 0:0:1]$ ] , because in that case one of the coefficients of the equations would be zero , contrary to the hypothesis .",
    "if the intersection point is in @xmath258 , it is clear that the tropicalization of all the lines contains the tropicalization of this point .",
    "it remains to look what happens if the point is in one of the coordinate lines .",
    "suppose w.l.o.g . that the point is @xmath259 $ ] , @xmath260 .",
    "if we take the affine plane corresponding to @xmath261 , then the affine coordinates of this point are @xmath262 and the affine equations of the lines are of the form @xmath263 , @xmath264 .",
    "let s take an element @xmath265 such that @xmath266 .",
    "there exists @xmath267 with @xmath268 . @xmath269 . as @xmath270",
    "we obtain that @xmath271 .",
    "so , the point @xmath272\\in",
    "t(l_i),\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k$ ] .",
    "in fact , what we obtain is an infinite number of points in the intersection of the tropical lines .",
    "[ pappus ] let 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 be five freely chosen points in the tropical plane given by homogeneous coordinates . define the following additional three points and nine lines by a sequence of stable join of points and stable meet of lines operations ( carried out by cross - products ) : @xmath273 then the three tropical lines @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 are concurrent .",
    "our goal is to see that the three constructed lines share a common point . for each line ,",
    "its construction is as follows @xmath274 we check on figure [ consta2 ] that the construction graph of @xmath89 is in fact a tree and the same holds for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "so for all general lifts of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , the construction of the lines @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 are well defined and yields to the tropical lines @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",

    "the lifts whose principal coordinates are not in @xmath54 in theorem [ levantamientogeneral ] include projective constructions whose tropicalization is different to the one computed using tropical cramer s rule or non well defined constructions in the projective space , such as the line passing through the points @xmath83 and @xmath83",
    ". this later case does not appear in the tropical situation if we interpret correctly the construction .",
    "suppose for example the case of pappus constructive version .",
    "we start from five input points .",
    "suppose that point 1 and 4 are the same .",

    "the tropical construction is well defined for the whole space of configurations of the original points , there is no need of generality in the tropical space .",
    "the input elements of an admissible tropical construction are completely free in the sense that there exists no condition on these elements in order to develop our construction and achieve the results .",
    "in this paper we have explored the possibility of developing a tropical counterpart of classical geometric constructions . in view of theorem [ levantamientogeneral ]",
    "we have succeeded for pappus theorem .",
    "but we have also shown through examples that there are several restrictions on the constructions to apply this theorem .",
    "it would be interesting to have some other remarkable examples of correct tropicalization of classical theorems .",
    "on the other hand , proposition [ consunpaso ] shows that , via cramer s rule , the situation is specially simple for one step constructions .",
    "we observe that this behavior is also present in some other successful applications of tropical geometry such as that of computing genus zero curves through a general configuration of points developed in @xcite .",
    "this is , too , a `` one step mathematics '' , since given a set of tropically general points , we `` merely '' construct the zero genus curves of given degree that passes through these points . the key problem seems to be handling tropical varieties constructed from other previously constructed varieties .",
    "so the morale suggested by the results presented in this paper is that using tropical geometry is affordable ( at this moment ) when dealing with `` one step mathematics '' , but it is not yet when dealing with geometric objects defined from other objects that are not free in some algebraic sense .",
