    "if one looks at the current along a line different from the characteristic line , say @xmath13 with @xmath14 , then for large time @xmath10 one just sees the gaussian fluctuations from the initial condition on a @xmath15 scale , since the dynamics generates fluctuations only @xmath12 , thus irrelevant  @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial interplay between the dynamically generated fluctuations and the one in the initial condition occurs in a region of order @xmath4 around the characteristic line .",
