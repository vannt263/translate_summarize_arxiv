    "the manifestation of vacuum fluctuations can be visualized through a mechanical effect on a materialized body .",
    "one of the most celebrated examples is the attractive casimir force between two parallel conducting plates  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon in general can be characterized by fluctuations under geometric constraints such that its spectrum on long wavelength modes is modified .",
    "nevertheless , this induced - force effect can also be probed through the coupling to a test particle .",
    "for example , consider an atom in its ground state as a test particle located near a perfectly conducting plate .",
    "the atom then experiences a position - dependent energy shift due to the boundary effect on vacuum fluctuations from which to give rise to an attractive casimir - polder force toward the plate  @xcite .",
    "thus , the presence of the boundary is expected to anisotropically change vacuum fluctuations . in this paper",
    "a charged test particle serves as a probe to understand the nature of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by observing their effects on the test - particle s trajectory .",
    "when a charged particle interacts with quantized electromagnetic fields , not only do the expectation values of fields determine the mean trajectory of the charge , but the accompanying quantum fluctuations also drive the charge into a zig - zag motion .",
    "the dynamics of the particle and field interaction has been studied quantum - mechanically in the system - plus - environment approach  @xcite .",
    "we treat the particle as the system of interest , and the degrees of freedom of fields as the environment .",
    "the influence of fields on the particle can be obtained with the method of feynman - vernon influence functional , by integrating out field variables within the context of the closed - time - path formalism  @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation can then be derived by ignoring the intrinsic quantum uncertainty of the particle , which is assumed to be much smaller than the resolution of the position measurements .",
    "this stochastic approach incorporates both dissipative backreaction arising from the interaction with fields , and a stochastic noise owing to the quantum fluctuations of fields .",
    "in particular , the non - uniformity of the charge s motion will result in radiation that backreacts on itself through the electromagnetic self - force .",
    "the stochastic noise , which encodes the influence of quantum statistics of fields , drives the charge into a fluctuating motion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the noise - averaged result reduces to the known abraham - lorentz - dirac equation with the self - force given by a third - order time derivative of the position as expected  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in the presence of the conducting plate has been studied via an interference experiment of the electrons , and is manifested in the form of the amplitude change and phase shift of the interference fringes  @xcite . in the previous article  @xcite , we employ the method of influence functional , and obtain the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the electron with self - consistent backreactions from quantized electromagnetic fields . under the classical approximation with prescribed electron s trajectories , it is shown that the modulus of the exponent in the influence functional describes the change of the interference contrast , and its phase results in an overall shift of the interference pattern .",
    "it is also found that the presence of the boundary anisotropically modifies the contrast of the interference fringes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the brownian motion of a charged particle coupled to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a perfectly conducting plate is studied for the case that the particle barely moves ; thus its dissipation effects is ignored .",
    "the behaviors of velocity fluctuations are shown different for the particle s motion in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the boundary plane . in this paper",
    ", we wish to further explore the anisotropic nature of vacuum fluctuations due to the boundary by the nontrivial motion of the charged particle where dissipative backreaction is incorporated in a consistent manner . in the presence of the boundary",
    ", we expect that radiation emitted by the charge in nonuniform motion should be bounced back and then impinge upon the original charge at later times",
    ". this will give rise to an additional retardation effect , which in turn results in a non - markovian evolution of the particle .",
    "thus , its mean trajectory will be altered . here",
    "we will apply red the approach of influence functional from which to derive the langevin equation beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "the trajectory fluctuations off the mean value driven by the stochastic noise will be studied with dissipation backreaction taken into account in a way that a underlying fluctuation - dissipation relation is obeyed .",

    "[ sec1 ] , we introduce the closed - time - path formalism to describe the evolution of the density matrix of a nonrelativistic charge coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields .",

    "apparently , the result superficially depends on the spectral function @xmath340 ; however , the integral to the right of the spectral function yields an expression proportional to @xmath341 .",
    "since the dimensionless relaxation constant @xmath317 can be related to the spectral density by @xmath342 , the boundary dependence due to the spectral density @xmath340 is canceled .",
    "thus , the result does not depend on the relaxation constant , hence independent of the orientation .",
    "recall that the function @xmath340 is proportional to the rate at which velocity fluctuations grow , while the time scales to reach the saturated regime are given by @xmath341 .",
    "thus it implies that although the velocity fluctuations increases at different rates at early times , they will take different amount of time to reach saturation . in the end ,",
    "the saturated values are independent of the direction of the motion , and are only determined by the oscillation frequency of the charged particle .",
    "this cancelation of the boundary dependence , in fact , can be understood as reminiscence of the fluctuations - dissipation relation since the function @xmath340 comes from the noise kernel @xmath255 while the dimensionless relaxation constant @xmath317 is inherited from the dissipation kernel @xmath343 .    as stated above , the integrand of eq",

    "the quadratic dependence on the cutoff can be characterized by the width of the particle s wave wavefunction .",

    "some comments are in order . in the limit @xmath347 , the motion of the charged particle becomes insignificant and the dissipation effect",

    "they are consistent as @xmath348 , apart from a factor @xmath349 due to an average over a period in the oscillatory motion . in this limit",
    ", the backreaction dissipation can be safely ignored because the relaxation constant @xmath350 with @xmath351 dependence , is vanishingly small for such a slow motion .",
    "nonetheless , for a finite value of @xmath311 , the nonuniform motion results in a dissipative effect , which damps out the particle s motion .      the typical behavior of time variation of velocity fluctuations is shown in fig .",

    "the horizontal axis is the dimensionless time @xmath363 , and the vertical axis is velocity fluctuations , normalized by the parameter @xmath364 .",

    "the cutoff - dependent terms is negligible except for very early times @xmath365 , which is vanishingly short when compared with the relaxation time scales for motion in either direction , about the order of @xmath366 .",
    "thus , their contribution can not possibly be seen in fig .",
    "[ fi : velotime ] .",
    "the anisotropic behavior of velocity fluctuations can be observed at the early stage when the velocity fluctuations grow linearly in time .",
    "it becomes more significant for the small value of @xmath367 , and can be estimated analytically from the ratio obtained from eq .   as @xmath368 however",
    ", the values of @xmath369 can not be arbitrarily small , and are constrained by the underlying assumptions . to be consistent with the dipole approximation",
    ", the amplitude of the charged oscillator should be much smaller than its distance to the plate , and can be set to the order of @xmath370 , for example .",
    "thus , the corresponding velocity @xmath216 of the charged oscillator is about @xmath371 .",
    "it can be argued that the charge s motion can not be too slow since it may give rise to a large position uncertainty to jeopardize the assumption of a point - like particle in the stochastic approach .",
    "it is of interest to take the electron as an example .",
    "because the de broglie wavelength , characterizing the size of the electron wavefunction , is @xmath372 , when the velocity is overly small , the spatial extension of the electron wavefunction can be the same as or even larger than the distance to the plate @xmath260 .",
    "then it contradicts to the earlier assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , the velocity of the electron may still be chosen as small as @xmath373 , consistent with @xmath374 , ending up with @xmath375 .",
    "thus , the oscillation frequency for such a slow motion is reduced to the value of @xmath376 .",
    "it will lead to the relaxation constant @xmath377 from eq .  .",
    "in addition , the dimensionless cutoff is then given by @xmath378 .",
    "thus , even for an electron in rather slow motion , appreciable anisotropy @xmath379 can be found during the time regime @xmath380 in which the cutoff dependence effect can be safely ignored while the saturation has not been reached yet in both directions .    at later times , the velocity fluctuations of the charged oscillator near the boundary reach saturation , independent of the orientation of the boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : velotime ] . the saturated value is approximately given by the @xmath381 as consequence of its nonuniform motion",
    ". the contribution of the velocity fluctuations , resulting from the imposition of the boundary conditions on electromagnetic fields , are at most the same order of magnitude as the cutoff - dependent terms .",
    "both of them can be argued to be ignored at late times .",
    "finally , the effective temperature corresponding to saturated velocity fluctuations for such brownian motion can be estimated by @xmath382 where @xmath383 is the boltzmann constant .    to conclude , we study the influence due to quantized electromagnetic fields on the motion of a nonrelativistic charged particle near the conducting plate .",
    "the nonlinear , non - markovian langevin equation of the particle is derived with the method of feynman - vernon influence functional , and it incorporates both dissipation backreaction on the charge in the form of the retarded self - force as well as the stochastic noise , manifested from vacuum fluctuations of quantized electromagnetic fields .",
    "the dipole approximation , an appropriate approximation for a non - relativistic motion , is implemented to find the solution to the langevin equation .",
    "we consider that the charged particle undergoes a small - amplitude oscillation in the direction either parallel or perpendicular to the boundary plane .",
    "the noise - averaged trajectory of this charged oscillator is governed by the classical dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the kernel @xmath384 , obtained by solving the langevin equation , is found to be dominated by the narrow resonance in the weak coupling limit where the ratio of the decay width @xmath350 over the oscillation frequency @xmath275 is much less than unity , @xmath385 .",
    "thus , the memory effects or the the effects of the time - delay on backreaction terms due to the presence of the boundary are just to modify the quantities such as @xmath275 , @xmath350 and so on . then , velocity fluctuations of the charged oscillator driven by stochastic forces are found to grow linearly with time in the early stage of the evolution at the rate given by the relaxation constant .",
    "it turns out to be smaller in the parallel case than in the perpendicular one with a similar configuration , and reveals strong anisotropic behavior .",
    "they are then asymptotically saturated as a result of the fluctuation - dissipation relation at rather different relaxation time scales . however , we find that the same saturated value is obtained for motion in both directions at late times , resulting from delicate balancing effects between dissipation backreaction and accompanying fluctuations , and thus the value is mainly determined by its oscillatory motion .",
    "so , at late times the effects from boundary - modified vacuum fluctuations on the velocity dispersion of the charged particle can be hardly seen .",
    "the dipole approximation amounts to linearizing the langevin equation obtained above .",
    "however , beyond the dipole approximation , one expects to introduce the additional drift effects on the dynamics of the particle from the trajectory - dependent green s functions .",
    "in particular , it may give rise to the noise - induced - drift forces owing to the correlations of stochastic forces .",
