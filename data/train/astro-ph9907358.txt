    "the current paradigm for forming isolated , sun - like low - mass stars begins with isolated clumps within lightly - ionized molecular clouds .",
    "the clumps are supported against self - gravity and external pressure by a combination of thermal ( and perhaps turbulent ) pressure and magnetic fields . since magnetic forces",
    "act on charged particles only , a relative drift between the charged species and the neutral matter is necessary to transmit the magnetic support to the predominantly neutral matter .",
    "this relative drift , called  ambipolar diffusion \" , reduces the magnetic flux ( and thus magnetic support ) gradually in the central region of the clump , causing the central density to grow quasi - statically .",
    "when the flux - to - mass ratio drops below certain critical value , a  runaway \" collapse ensues , forming a protostar at the center ( see reviews by nakano 1984 ; shu , adams & lizano 1987 ; mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "this star formation process was given the picturesque name of  gravomagneto - catastrophe \" by shu ( 1995 ) , in analogy to the  gravothermo - catastrophe \" discussed by lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) in the context of stellar cluster evolution ( see  8.2 of binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the end product of the  gravomagneto - catastrophe \" is the birth of a new sun - like star .",
    "the above paradigm provides an attractive framework to synthesize a wide range of observations , as reviewed by shu et al .",
    "many quantitative predictions of the paradigm remain to be worked out in details , however .",
    "one example is the structure and kinematics of dense cores at various stages of their evolution , for which detailed observational data are now becoming available ( myers 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , a recent detection of extended inward motion in the  starless \" core l1544 ( tafalla et al . 1998 ) prompts the authors to conclude that  if this core is in the process of forming stars , our observations suggest that it is doing so in a manner not contemplated by the standard theories of star formation .",
    "our study of l1544 illustrates how little is still known about the physical conditions that precede star formation , and how detailed studies of starless cores are urgently needed . \" the standard picture , as outlined above , may still be able to explain such seemly contradictory observations . of course , we can not be certain until quantitative predictions of the cloud dynamics according to the standard picture are made .",
    "the technical difficulty of such a task is daunting : the dynamic range required going from interstellar clouds to compact protostellar objects is enormous .",
    "this aspect alone would be difficult to handle in itself .",
    "the inclusion of magnetic field and its subtle coupling to the cloud matter makes the task even more challenging .",
    "impressive theoretical progresses have been made on the dynamical aspect of the star formation problem over the last three decades under various simplifying assumptions .",
    "we can roughly divide previous investigations into three periods . in the first period ,",
    "most of studies were concentrated on nonmagnetic , nonrotating isothermal spheres , as exemplified by various classes of self - similar solutions found by larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) , by shu ( 1977 ) and by hunter ( 1977 ) . in the second period , well - ordered magnetic fields",
    "were included in the initial equilibrium configurations of the clouds ( mouschovias 1976 ) and their evolution due to ambipolar diffusion was followed using quasi - static numerical codes ( nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ) . the process of core formation out of the background can be investigated up to a central density enhancement of a few hundreds .",
    "beyond such an enhancement the quasi - static assumption begins to break down and a dynamic code is needed to follow through the rest of the core formation process . in the third period , mouschovias and coworkers have developed dynamic codes that can follow the density increase by a factor of @xmath5 , close to the formation of a central protostar ( e.g. , basu & mouschovias 1994 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "these are essentially one dimensional calculations , making good use of the fact that the cloud matter settles along magnetic field lines into a disk - like configuration when the plasma-@xmath6 ( defined conventionally as the ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures ) is small ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) .",
    "they left open , however , the question of the evolution of magnetic clouds with the magnetic pressure comparable to , or even smaller than , the thermal pressure .",
    "such clouds are perhaps more sphere - like than disk - like ( see li & shu 1996 for a sequence of cloud configurations with various degree of magnetization ) .    motivated by the roundish appearance of many dense molecular cores and as a step towards a quantitative understanding of the star formation process , i choose to study the evolution of magnetic clouds in a spherical geometry .",
    "such a simplified geometry overcomes the dynamic range problem almost trivially , with a lagrangian code ( e.g. , foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "magnetic fields tend to introduce anisotropy to the cloud mass distribution ( li & shu 1996 ) and strictly speaking two - dimensional ( 2-d ) codes are required .",
    "safier , mckee & stahler ( 1997 ) made the ingenious suggestion of driving ambipolar diffusion with magnetic pressure gradient alone , which made the reduction to 1-d possible while retaining the essence of the dynamical problem .",
    "it is borne out by subsequent numerical calculations of li ( 1998 ) who , using a eulerian code following mouschovias & morton ( 1991 ) , showed that the evolution of magnetized spherical clouds is broadly similar to those studied by mouschovias and collaborators . as with their thin - disk simplification in the case of relatively strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the spherical geometry allows one to investigate additional physical processes that are important to the star formation process but are currently difficult to be incorporated into genuinely 2-d , dynamic codes , such as that of fielder & mouschovias ( 1993 ) .",
    "the work of li ( 1998 ) provides a starting point for the present investigation .",
    "there are two major improvements of the present study over that of li ( 1998 ) : 1 ) a lagrangian instead of eulerian method implemented to enhance the dynamic range , taking full advantage of the simplified geometry ; and 2 ) detailed calculations of number densities of charged species ( including dust grains ) from cosmic ray ionization .",
    "the use of lagrangian coordinates was the original approach of safier et al .",
    "they found the coordinates convenient for obtaining analytic solutions for the quasi - static epoch of the cloud evolution .",
    "these analytic solutions were obtained by omitting the ion velocity and the thermal pressure .",
    "the inclusion of both quantities in the dynamic as well as the quasistatic epochs of the cloud evolution necessitates a numerical treatment of the problem , as done in this paper .",
    "the second improvement is particularly important because the number densities of the charged species determine the coupling coefficient between magnetic fields and the cloud matter , which controls the cloud evolution .",
    "the field - matter coupling is where the dynamical effects of dust grains come in .",
    "as shown by nakano and coworkers ( e.g. , nakano 1984 ; nakano & umebayashi 1986 ; nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 ) and others , dust grains play a crucial role in the magnetic coupling . not only can dust grains be charged and tied to magnetic fields themselves",
    ", they substantially modify the number densities of other charged species  ions and electrons  as well .",
    "additional improvements , such as the inclusion of time - dependent chemistry ( necessary for understanding , for example , the chemical differentiation observed by kuiper , langer & velusamy 1996 in l1498 ) and its effects on the cloud dynamics , will be treated in the future .    to gauge the dynamical effects of dust grains ,",
    "i shall first consider a reference model in which the magnetic coupling coefficient is fixed at a canonical value ( approximately valid in general at densities below about @xmath2@xmath3 and over a wider density range for certain grain - size distributions ; see  5.2 ) , and then an improved model in which the coupling coefficient is evaluated self - consistently from ionization equilibrium , taking into account the size distribution of dust grains .",
    "i shall discuss the model predictions , their limitations , and their implications for the structure and kinematics of dense molecular cores ( especially those  starless \" ones that are yet to harbor embedded stellar sources ) as well as the protostellar mass growth rate .",
    "the governing equations for the evolution of a spherical , magnetized cloud in an eulerian form are given by li ( 1998 ; his equations 6 - 10 ) . here",
    "i rewrite these equations into a lagrangian form as @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9,\\ ] ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the flow speed of the predominantly neutral cloud matter and the speed of the magnetic field lines respectively , @xmath13 the spherical radius , @xmath14 the mass enclosed within a sphere , @xmath15 the mass density , and @xmath16 the magnetic field strength .",
    "a constant isothermal sound speed of @xmath17 is assumed for the cloud .",
    "if ions are the main provider of the magnetic coupling and are well - tied to the field lines , then @xmath18 ( ion velocity ) , and the coupling of the magnetic field to the neutral matter is determined by the ion - neutral collision timescale @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic force , @xmath21 the mass density of hydrogen molecules ( we neglect the collision of ions with helium atoms following mouschovias & morton 1990 ) , @xmath22 the ion density and @xmath23 a coupling constant . in the more general case where magnetic fields are not necessarily tied to ions , we can define a magnetic field - neutral coupling timescale @xmath24 analogous to @xmath25 in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "it is the timescale that it would take the magnetic force to accelerate hydrogen molecules to the drift velocity between the magnetic field and the neutrals .",
    "the evaluation of this timescale is nontrivial , and needs to be done numerically ( see   4 ) .    to cast the above equations into a nondimensional form ready for a numerical attack ,",
    "we follow li ( 1998 ) by scaling the density and the field strength by their initial values at the cloud center , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the time by the initial central free - fall timescale @xmath28 and the speed by the initial central alfvn speed @xmath29 the natural scales for the radius and the mass are then @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . with these scalings , we can rewrite equations ( 1)-(4 ) into @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where the dimensionless variables are @xmath36 note that equation ( 11 ) , which governs the evolution of the flux - to - mass ratio , is obtained by combining equation ( 3 ) and the mass continuity equation .",
    "there are two dimensionless constants that appear in the above equations .",
    "one of them , @xmath37 , denotes the initial ratio of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure at the cloud center , @xmath38 . the other is the magnetic coupling coefficient @xmath39 , defined as the ratio of the local free - fall timescale @xmath40 and the magnetic field - neutral coupling timescale @xmath41 defined in equation ( 6 )",
    "that is , @xmath42 in the special case where ions are the main provider of the magnetic coupling and are well - tied to the field lines , the expression for @xmath39 reduces to the familiar form @xmath43 .",
    "it is called `` the collapse retardation factor '' by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1994 ) . in the canonical case",
    "where @xmath44 , the coupling parameter @xmath39 is a constant independent of the cloud density and field strength , with a nominal value of about 10 ( galli & shu 1993 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "we shall use the case with @xmath45 as a reference to gauge the effects of a detailed treatment of the magnetic field - matter coupling , where the coefficient is computed self - consistently for each given pair of density and field strength from ionization equilibrium .",
    "dense nh@xmath46 cores of molecular clouds have typical number densities of a few times @xmath47@xmath3 ( myers 1995 ) .",
    "they are believed to be formed out of clumps of lower densities , such as those probed by @xmath48co which have typical number densities of a few times @xmath1 @xmath3 . as in previous studies of molecular cloud evolution ( e.g. , lizano & shu 1989",
    "; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ; basu & mouschovias 1994 ) , i adopt the lower - density clumps as the starting point for our calculation , even though how they are formed in the first place remains an open question .",
    "one suggestion is that they are formed out of magnetized , turbulent medium of an even lower density ( gammie & ostriker 1996 ) . for simplicity",
    ", i shall ignore the turbulent pressure and assume that the magnetic pressure is initially equal to the thermal pressure everywhere in the cloud .",
    "it demands that @xmath49 , where @xmath37 is the inverse of the conventional plasma-@xmath6 parameter at the cloud center .",
    "if @xmath37 is much smaller than unity , then the magnetic field may not play a significant role in the cloud dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath37 is much larger than unity , then the cloud would probably appear more disk - like than sphere - like , invalidating our simplification of geometry . in any case , with @xmath49 , i find an overall mass - to - flux ratio for the cloud not far from the critical value of @xmath50 ( see figure  1f below ) , consistent with currently available zeeman observations of magnetic fields in dense clouds ( e.g. , crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "i shall limit my discussion to relatively low - mass clumps of order ten solar masses that form only one dense core at a time .",
    "many isolated , star - forming bok globules seem to fall into this category ( clemens & barvainis 1988 ) .",
    "the clump is idealized as a magnetized sphere , whose mass is to be compared with the ( thermal ) bonnor - ebert mass of a pressure - confined sphere .",
    "if the clump has a mass less than the bonnor - ebert mass , it will evolve toward a stable configuration with uniform magnetic field and become a `` failed core '' in the terminology of lizano & shu ( 1989 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the clump has a mass greater than the bonnor - ebert mass , it is destined to collapse and form stars as magnetic support weakens due to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we are interested in the latter case only . for definiteness ,",
    "i choose a clump with a total mass of @xmath51 m@xmath52 , a constant temperature of @xmath51 k , and an initial molecular hydrogen number density of @xmath53@xmath3 at the center .",
    "together with @xmath49 , they yield a static initial cloud configuration with the following dimensional units for dimensionless quantities used in the direct numerical calculations : @xmath54 @xmath3 for mass density ( including @xmath55 of he by number ) , @xmath56 km s@xmath57 for velocity ( @xmath58 times the isothermal sound speed @xmath59 km s@xmath57 ) , @xmath60 pc for radius , @xmath61 m@xmath52 for mass , and @xmath62 g for field strength .",
    "dimensional units for other choices of cloud parameters can be obtained easily from formulae in the last section .",
    "it turns out that this particular cloud has a total mass about 1.8 times the bonnor - ebert mass and a center - to - edge density contrast of about 2.8 .",
    "the cloud would remain in a static equilibrium indefinitely were it not for ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "we turn on ambipolar diffusion at the time t=0 , and follow the cloud evolution numerically .",
    "the cloud evolution is subjected to the following boundary conditions at all times : at the origin , we impose the usual reflection symmetry , which demands that the spatial derivatives of the density and the field strength vanish and that the flow speed be zero .",
    "the reflection symmetry is valid as long as the central density remains finite , since the thermal pressure should be able to erase any cusp over a jeans lengthscale around the origin . at the outer edge of the cloud",
    ", we assume a free pressure boundary across which thermal pressure and magnetic pressure are balanced separately , as in mouschovias & morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "it implies that the density and the field strength at the edge are fixed at their initial values at all times .      for each time step , the cloud evolution is carried out numerically in two parts : ( 1 ) a hydrodynamic part and ( 2 ) a magnetic field diffusion part .",
    "i use a lagrangian method to treat the hydrodynamics .",
    "the method is well known and is documented in details in , e.g. , chapter 4 of the textbook  numerical modeling in applied physics and astrophysics \" by bowers and wilson ( 1991 ) .",
    "it is well - suited for one dimensional problems such as the one at hand .",
    "briefly , one first divides the cloud mass into a number of zones and applies the momentum equation ( 10 ) at the zone boundaries to update the cloud velocity .",
    "it is followed by solving equation ( 12 ) for a new set of zone boundary positions .",
    "conservation of mass in each zone then yields a updated density from equation ( 9 ) .",
    "this finishes the first part of the calculation . for the second part",
    ", one needs to solve the diffusion equation ( 11 ) for the magnetic field distribution .",
    "an efficient technique for such a task is the method of gaussian elimination .",
    "interested readers can find detailed discussions of this method in   6.4 of bowers and wilson ( 1991 ) .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated for each time step of the cloud evolution .",
    "the cloud is initially in a hydromagnetic equilibrium . at time @xmath63",
    ", ambipolar diffusion is turned on .",
    "the subsequent cloud evolution is followed numerically . in column 2 of table  1",
    ", i list the the time intervals it takes the cloud to increase its central number density by eight successive factors of 10 in the reference model , from @xmath1 to @xmath64 @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that the cloud evolves at an increasingly fast pace , as found by many previous studies .",
    "the density formally reaches infinity in a finite amount of time , forming a compact stellar system at the center .",
    "the increase in the cloud density is usually associated with the core formation phase of star formation , where the `` core '' is probed observationally by high density molecular tracers , such as nh@xmath46 and cs ( e.g. , myers 1995 ) .",
    "various model properties of the `` core '' are displayed in figure  1 , when the central density reaches @xmath1 ( initial ) , @xmath47 , ... , @xmath64 cm @xmath65 . from the density and magnetic field distributions in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we find that the cloud always maintains a plateau plus envelope structure .",
    "the density and field strength are more or less uniform in the central plateau region but decrease with radius roughly as a power - law in the envelope .",
    "one notable feature is that the power index for the density , shown in panel ( c ) , is close to -2.3 in the bulk of the envelope , which is somewhat steeper than -2 , the index for a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "panels ( a)-(c ) specify the structure of the cloud .",
    "the cloud kinematics is shown in panel ( d ) , where the contraction speed is plotted against radius .",
    "notice that , in this idealized spherical model , most of the cloud is contracting at a speed of order 0.1 km s@xmath57 ( i.e. , about half of the isothermal sound speed @xmath59 km s@xmath57 ) or higher when the central number density exceeds about @xmath2@xmath3 . such extended pre - collapse motion may have interesting implications for the kinematics of `` starless '' cores ( to be discussed in   6.1 ) .",
    "the extent of cloud contraction can also be seen from panel ( e ) , where the contraction speed is plotted against mass .",
    "the maximum infall speed occurs near the plateau - envelope boundary , with the plateau contracting `` outside - in '' ( i.e. , the highest speed at the largest radius ) and the envelope `` inside - out '' .",
    "all these structural changes and kinematics are resulted from a redistribution of magnetic fields due to field diffusion ( nakano 1979 ; mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "the redistribution is shown most clearly in the distribution of the mass - to - flux ratio , plotted in panel ( f ) .",
    "the ratio increases steadily above the critical value of unity in most part of the cloud , except in the plateau region .",
    "it indicates that the evolution of the plateau region is controlled to a large extent by magnetic diffusion .",
    "within star - forming molecular clouds shielded from external ultraviolet radiation , ionization is mainly due to cosmic rays .",
    "the ionization level in such predominantly neutral clouds have been investigated by several authors , e.g. , elmegreen ( 1979 ) , draine & sutin ( 1987 ) , and especially nakano and collaborators ( see nakano 1984 for a review ) .",
    "these latter authors developed a simplified reaction scheme which involves the following set of charged species : electron ( e@xmath66 ) , h@xmath67 , he@xmath67 , c@xmath67 , h@xmath68 , molecular ions ( m@xmath67 ; except h@xmath68 ) , metal ions ( m@xmath67 ) , and charged dust grains .",
    "the reactions are initiated through the ionization of h@xmath69 and he by cosmic rays and radioactive elements .",
    "interested readers should consult  2.1 of umebayashi & nakano ( 1990 ) for details .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in calculating cloud ionization level is the size distribution of dust grains .",
    "dust grains have two opposing effects on the coupling between magnetic field and the cloud matter .",
    "on one hand , small grains have large total surface area which allows efficient recombination of ions and electrons on grain surfaces , leading to a weakening of the coupling . on the other hand , charged grains ( especially small ones ) are themselves tied to the magnetic field , providing an additional coupling agent besides ions and electrons .",
    "detailed calculations are needed to determine which effect dominates .",
    "nishi et al .",
    "( 1991 ; see their   2 for details ) considered four possible grain - size distributions : ( 1 ) the standard distribution of mathis , rumpl & nordsieck ( 1977 ; hereafter mrn ) with @xmath70 between @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number density of grains and the coefficient @xmath73 @xmath74 ; ( 2 ) the mrn distribution with ice mantles ( @xmath75 ) ; ( 3 ) the extended mrn distribution without ice mantles ( @xmath76 ) , and ( 4 ) the standard mrn distribution plus an additional population of grains with a size of @xmath77 .",
    "the smallest dust grains in models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) were proposed to explain infrared observations of mainly diffuse clouds and reflection nebulae ( e.g. , leger & puget 1984 ) .",
    "direct observational evidences for their existence in dense molecular cloud cores are still lacking ( boulanger et al .",
    "1998 ) . for this reason",
    ", we shall concentrate on the cloud evolution with the standard mrn distribution , i.e. , model ( 1 ) .",
    "the case with ice - coated grain distribution of model ( 2 ) is qualitatively similar ( see   5 ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the cloud evolution is initiated and controlled by the diffusion of magnetic fields relative to the neutral matter .",
    "depending on the number densities of the charged species and the field strength , the diffusion falls into two conceptually distinctive regimes : the ambipolar diffusion regime and the ohmic dissipation regime ( nakano 1984 ) .",
    "a unified formulation is provided by nakano & umebayashi ( 1986 ) , who found analytical expressions for the relative drift velocity of field lines with respect to neutral matter under the action of arbitrary magnetic forces . magnetic flux enclosed within a circle that moves with the drift velocity relative to the neutrals",
    "is conserved , no matter which of the two field dissipation processes dominates .",
    "it is the formulation that i shall adopt .",
    "it represents a significant improvement over previous dynamical calculations , and will become especially important in the high density regions during the late stages of the cloud evolution .",
    "i ignore the momentum coupling of the neutral grains to the charged grains due to inelastic charge capture , whose effect has been shown to be minor ( ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ; nakano 1984 ) .",
    "according to nakano & umebayashi ( 1986 ; see also nishi et al .",
    "1991 ) , the cross - field velocity of field lines relative to the neutral matter is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , the density , the stopping time in a sea of neutrals and the cyclotron frequency of a charged particle @xmath83 with mass @xmath84 and charge @xmath85 . from equations ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) , we can obtain the following expression for the dimensionless magnetic coupling coefficient @xmath86 which controls the field diffusion .",
    "it depends on the cloud density @xmath15 as well as the number densities of all charged species and the field strength through @xmath80 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath87 in the quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for a given ionization rate by cosmic rays and radioactive elements ,",
    "i compute the equilibrium charge densities as a function of the cloud density for the standard mrn grain - size distribution using nishi s ionization code .",
    "these charge distributions are shown in figure  1 of nishi et al .",
    "they are obtained by dividing the grain size distribution into 20 bins of equal width in the logarithmic space .",
    "the steady - state rate equations for all species , including dust grains , are then solved iteratively .    with the charge density @xmath80 thus determined",
    ", it is easy to compute the coupling coefficient @xmath39 as a function of density and field strength from equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  2 , where @xmath39 is plotted against the number density of molecular hydrogen for various values of the magnetic field strength ranging from @xmath90 g to @xmath91 g ( with an increment factor of @xmath92 ) , assuming a canonical cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath93s@xmath57 and an ionization rate of @xmath94s@xmath57 from radioactive elements ( umebayashi & nakano 1990 ) .",
    "there are several interesting features in figure  2 : ( 1 ) in the low density region ( below about @xmath2@xmath3 ) , the coupling coefficient is rather insensitive to either density or field strength .",
    "it has a value close to the canonical value of @xmath45 ; ( 2 ) as density increases , @xmath39 can differ from its canonical value by a large factor .",
    "for relatively weak magnetic fields , the coupling parameter drops quickly below unity , making the field essentially decoupled from the cloud matter .",
    "for relatively strong fields , the coupling parameter can exceed its canonical value by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "such a strong coupling has important consequences for the cloud dynamics , as we shall see shortly ; and ( 3 ) at large enough densities , decoupling will occur for any reasonable value of field strength .",
    "the implication of such a decoupling for the `` magnetic flux problem '' of star formation is discussed by li & mckee ( 1996 ) and ciolek & knigl ( 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic coupling coefficient could be highly variable .",
    "this is why it must be evaluated self - consistently .",
    "because of the improvement in the treating the magnetic coupling , we call the present model the `` improved '' model . the improvement",
    "mostly affects the cloud evolution in the high density region , beyond about @xmath2@xmath3 .      with the coupling coefficient @xmath39 known as a function of density and field strength",
    ", one can repeat the cloud evolution calculation by integrating equations ( 8)-(11 ) simultaneously .",
    "i adopt the same initial and boundary conditions as in the reference model of   3 .",
    "the only difference is that the previously assumed constant coefficient @xmath45 is now replaced by a self - consistently computed function @xmath95 , shown in figure  2 .",
    "the main properties of the cloud evolution in this improved model are displayed in table  1 and figure  3 . in table  1",
    "( column 3 ) , i list the time intervals it takes the cloud to increase its central number density by eight successive factors of 10 , from @xmath96 to @xmath64@xmath3 .",
    "these time intervals are quite comparable to their counterparts in the reference case",
    ". the slightly smaller time intervals at the early times of the cloud evolution are due to the fact that the magnetic coupling coefficient at low densities is somewhat smaller than the canonical value of @xmath45 used in the reference model ( see figure  2 ) . at higher densities ,",
    "the time intervals become slightly longer than those of the reference model , because of better magnetic coupling due to dust grains ( see   5.1 ) .",
    "the differences between the improved model and the reference model are more apparent in the structure and kinematics of the cloud . from figure  3",
    ", we find that , while there is still a plateau - envelope profile for the density ( panel a ) and field strength ( panel b ) in the improved model , the distributions in the envelope deviate considerably from a single power - law .",
    "this behavior is seen most clearly in panel ( c ) , where the power - index for density distribution is plotted as a function of radius . a dramatic steepening of the density profile near",
    "the plateau - envelope boundary is evident . in panel",
    "( d ) , i display the velocity profile of the cloud , for both neutrals ( solid lines ) and molecular ions ( represented by hco@xmath67 ; dotted lines ) . as in the reference model ( figure  1d ) , substantial contraction ( faster than , say , about half an isothermal sound speed ) is obtained in the bulk of the cloud after the central density goes beyond about @xmath2@xmath3 . during the later times of the cloud evolution , the maximum infall speed can be substantially larger in the improved model than in the reference model , by a factor of two or more . at the end of the run , it reaches a value of @xmath97 km s@xmath57 , more than eight times the isothermal sound speed . at the radius where the maximum infall occurs",
    ", we have a number density @xmath98@xmath3 and a field strength @xmath99 mg , which yield a local alfvn speed of @xmath100 km s@xmath57 , almost three times the sound speed .",
    "the corresponding alfvn mach number is therefore @xmath101 , which is not far from the mach number of 3.3 obtained in the self - similar solution of larson - penston for the collapse of nonmagnetic singular isothermal spheres ( see also basu 1998 ) .",
    "note that , despite the super - alfvnic speed , shocks will not form during this phase of the cloud evolution because individual fluid parcels in the super - alfvnic inflow are not decelerated .",
    "the most striking feature of the improved case is shown in panel ( e ) of figure  3 , where the infall speed is plotted against the mass in solar mass units : a mass of 0.62 m@xmath52 in the central region of the cloud , enough to build a typical low - mass star , appears to collapse more or less homologously at the end of the run .",
    "note also that the mass - to - flux ratio , shown in panel ( f ) , is well below that of the reference model in the inner part of the cloud . in the next section",
    ", we shall trace these differences to the dynamical effects of dust grains .",
    "the only input quantity that is different between the reference model and the improved model is the coupling coefficient between magnetic fields and the cloud matter . in the former case ,",
    "the coefficient is given as a constant .",
    "in the latter case , it is calculated self - consistently during the cloud evolution",
    ". this difference must be responsible for the differences in the cloud properties outlined in the last section . in figure  4a",
    ", we show the distribution of the self - consistently calculated coupling coefficient @xmath39 as a function of the cloud number density at the same nine times as in figure  3 .",
    "note that the coupling coefficient is within a factor of two of the canonical value at low densities with @xmath102@xmath3 .",
    "it peaks between @xmath103@xmath3 and @xmath104@xmath3 , with a peak value of almost an order of magnitude larger than the canonical value . at still higher densities ,",
    "the coupling coefficient decreases steadily , dropping below the canonical value at a number density between @xmath105 and @xmath64@xmath3 .",
    "the peak in the distribution of the magnetic coupling coefficient results from dust grains .",
    "naively , one may not expect dust grains to dominate the magnetic coupling since they tend to be more loosely tied to magnetic fields than ions and they take longer to stop by collision with neutrals than ions ( i.e. , less efficient in momentum exchange ) .",
    "however , both tendencies could be compensated by the fact that dust grains are much heavier than ions , and thus provide more inertia per unit charge .",
    "it is for this same reason that ions usually contribute more to the magnetic coupling than electrons .",
    "these opposing effects show up in the expression for the coupling coefficient , equation ( 18 ) , written as a sum over contributions from individual charged species @xmath106\\ ] ] where the definitions of @xmath89 and @xmath107 have been used . in figure",
    "4b , i plot the contributions from electrons , all kinds of ions , all dust grains as well as dust grains in each of the 20 size bins as a function of the cloud density at the end of the run in the improved model .",
    "it is apparent that the dust grains dominate the coupling at most of the density range except near the low - density end ( @xmath108@xmath3 ) , where ions dominate .",
    "contribution from electrons is not significant anywhere .",
    "furthermore , small grains contribute more to the magnetic coupling than large grains , as expected .",
    "the enhancement of the magnetic coupling coefficient due to dust grains , especially in the intermediate density region between @xmath103 to @xmath104 @xmath3 , makes it difficult for magnetic flux to leave the central region of the cloud .",
    "the slow leakage of magnetic flux is the reason why the central mass - to - flux ratio changes relatively little at the late times ( see figure  3f ) of the cloud evolution .",
    "it also explains the creation of the more or less homologously contracting `` core '' seen in figure  3e .",
    "as the density of the core @xmath109 increases , its size shrinks approximately as @xmath110 since little mass is leaving the core .",
    "it leads to an increase of the field strength approximately as @xmath111 because of near flux - freezing in a spherical geometry . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic pressure in the core should scale with the density roughly as @xmath112 ( see also safier et al .",
    "it dominates the thermal pressure at high densities since the thermal pressure increases more slowly with density ( @xmath113 for an isothermal cloud ) .",
    "therefore , we have a core with an effective adiabatic index of approximately 4/3 . it is well known from studies of stellar core collapse ( goldreich & weber 1980 ; yahil 1983 ) that cores with such an equation of state tend to contract homologously .",
    "such a contraction may have important implications for the protostellar mass accretion rate ( see the next section ) .",
    "the existence of a nearly homologously contracting core explains the differences in the distributions of density and field strength in the envelope between the improved and the reference models . since little mass and magnetic flux leak out of the central region into the inner part of the envelope in the improved model as compared to the reference model , the central density and field strength are higher for the same degree of contraction .",
    "this in turn creates a steeper gradient just outside the core than further out in the envelope , as shown in figures  3a through 3d .",
    "i should point out that the homologously contracting core found in the spherical geometry may disappear in the more realistic axisymmetric geometry , even when the magnetic pressure is smaller than the thermal pressure ( and thus a roundish cloud ) to begin with .",
    "the enhanced magnetic coupling due to dust grains traps magnetic flux , leading to a more rapid increase of the magnetic pressure than the thermal pressure , as mentioned above . at a high enough density ,",
    "the magnetic pressure will start to dominate the thermal pressure , forcing the inner part of the cloud to flatten along the field lines ( tomisaka 1996 ) . in the limit of a thin disk with frozen - in magnetic field , the field strength increases linearly with the surface density , which is proportional to the square root of the mass density for an isothermal , self - gravitating disk in equilibrium along field lines ( in the absence of appreciable magnetic squeezing ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 instead of @xmath115 , and the magnetic pressure will not stiffen up the equation of state .",
    "in fact , in the presence of magnetic diffusion , the field strength will increase more slowly than @xmath116 , leading to a softening of the equation of state relative to isothermal .",
    "this may explain the shallower - than-@xmath117 slope of the density profile in the envelope found by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1994 ; see also basu & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic tension tends to dominate the magnetic pressure force in a disk geometry .",
    "it effectively dilutes the gravity ( shu & li 1997 ) , leading to a slower cloud contraction than the spherical case where the tension force is ignored on purpose ( safier et al .",
    "ideally , one should develop 2-d axisymmetric codes to treat realistic molecular clouds with the magnetic forces comparable to the thermal force , perhaps along the line of fiedler & mouschovias ( 1993 ) but with a weaker initial magnetic field and an improved treatment of the magnetic coupling . a further complication that needs to be addressed in more realistic future calculations",
    "is the presence and decay of ( magnetic ) turbulent pressure , which may play an important ( or even dominant ) role in the core formation process ( nakano 1998 ; myers & lazarian 1998 ; see also lizano & shu 1989 ) .",
    "we have considered in our `` improved '' model one particular size distribution for dust grains - the standard mrn distribution .",
    "it enhances the magnetic coupling considerably over the canonical value in an intermediate range of densities . to gauge the effects of dust grains of other size distributions , one needs to recalculate the number densities of all charged species",
    "this has been done by nishi et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for several cases , and i shall rely exclusively on their results in the discussion below .    as mentioned in   4.1 , nishi et al .",
    "( 1991 ) calculated the number densities of charged species for four models of grain size distributions : ( 1 ) the standard mrn distribution between @xmath71 ; ( 2 ) the mrn distribution with ice mantles ( @xmath75 ) ; ( 3 ) the extended mrn distribution without ice mantles ( @xmath76 ) , and ( 4 ) the standard mrn distribution plus an additional population of grains with a size of @xmath77 .",
    "for each of these four models , they computed a magnetic dissipation timescale @xmath118 for an oblate cloud with a `` critical '' magnetic field strength @xmath119 and compared it to a free - fall timescale defined as @xmath120 which is somewhat different from our definition of freefall timescale @xmath121 below equation ( 14 ) . both @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    "are plotted in their figure  5 as a function of the number density of atomic hydrogen , @xmath124 .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of these two timescales , @xmath125 is almost identical to our definition of the magnetic coupling coefficient @xmath39 in equation ( 18 ) .",
    "one can therefore roughly read off the coupling coefficient from their figure  5 , although the exact value depends on the field strength , which needs to be computed self - consistently in a dynamical model such as ours .",
    "a comparison of the timescale ratio in nishi et al.s figure  5 for model ( 1 ) , with the standard mrn grain size distribution , and the coupling coefficient displayed in our figure  4a shows that they are indeed broadly similar , with a value close to @xmath51 at low densities , and peaking somewhere between @xmath126 and @xmath104@xmath3 , before dropping off at still higher densities .",
    "the timescale ratio for model ( 2 ) , with ice - coated grains , shows similar , although somewhat higher , enhancement at the intermediate density range .",
    "we therefore expect the evolution of a magnetic cloud with ice - coated grains to be similar to our improved case , where dust grains of the standard mrn distribution is considered .",
    "in particular , the characteristic , homologously collapsing core should also be present in spherical geometry , as is confirmed by a detailed calculation .",
    "the introduction of very small dust grains in models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of nishi et al . changes the magnetic coupling coefficient considerably .",
    "naively , one expects that a large quantity small grains should make the coupling better . in reality , the ionization level of the cloud is typically such that there is not enough charge for every small dust grain . as a result ,",
    "most of the small grains remain neutral , and are thus `` wasted '' as far as the magnetic coupling is concerned ( see , however , ciolek & mouschovias 1994 for a discussion about coupling between charged and neutral grains ) . from figure  5 of nishi et al . , we find that the field dissipation timescale @xmath122 remains about a factor of 10 above the free - fall timescale @xmath123 over a wide range of density in these two cases .",
    "we therefore expect the magnetic coupling coefficient to be close to the canonical value @xmath51 and the evolution of clouds with these two model grain size distributions to resemble our reference model , as long as the density is below the decoupling density ( which is of order @xmath105@xmath3 or higher ) .    for dense molecular cloud cores , both theoretical studies and observations",
    "point to a grain - size distribution that could be substantially different from that in the diffuse interstellar medium ( evans 1996 ; krgel & siebenmorgen 1996 ) : dust grains tend to acquire ice - mantles , coagulate and become fluffier .",
    "in particular , smallest grains ( @xmath127 ) tend to be swept up quickly by large grains ( chokshi , tielens & hollenbach 1993 ) , while ice - coating can increase the size of grains by a factor up to two .",
    "these considerations lead to the conclusion that model ( 2 ) of nishi et al .",
    "is perhaps the most plausible distribution in dense cores .",
    "for such a distribution , the magnetic coupling due to dust grains should be enhanced above the value obtained in our improved model .",
    "ideally , one would like to follow the change of grain - size distribution due to coagulation and ice - coating simultaneously with the cloud dynamics .",
    "such a task is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our model core - formation calculations suggest that most of dense molecular cloud cores may be contracting at half a sound speed or more after the central density increases by a factor of about @xmath0 from its initial value .",
    "this pre - collapse motion may help explain an interesting puzzle in some dense core properties .",
    "observations of n@xmath69h@xmath67 and c@xmath46h@xmath69 by benson , caselli & myers ( 1998 ) show that the two molecules , one is charged and one is not , move more or less together , with a relative drift velocity between them smaller than @xmath128 km s@xmath57 .",
    "if the cores were nearly static and their evolution controlled by ambipolar diffusion , then for a typical core radius of @xmath129 pc it will take at least 2 myrs to allow the central density to increase by a significant factor and form a star .",
    "this would imply a typical lifetime for `` starless '' cores an order of magnitude longer than that inferred from statistics of dense n@xmath46h cores associated with iras sources ( beichman et al .",
    "1986 ) , which is a few times @xmath2 years ( e.g. , shu 1995 ; walmsley 1998 ) .",
    "an obvious resolution of this discrepancy , as suggested by figure 3d , is that the ions and neutrals are contracting more or less together , at a speed of , say @xmath130 km s@xmath57 or more , much larger than the ion - neutral drift speed ( less than about 0.02 km s@xmath57 in the improved model ) once a dense core is formed out of the initial , less dense background cloud . for an initial cloud central density of @xmath1@xmath3 , our calculations suggest that a `` starless '' dense core with a _ central _ density of @xmath2@xmath3 ( the average density could be somewhat smaller ; mizuno et al . 1994 ) lasts about @xmath131 years before the central density formally goes to infinity and becomes a `` starred '' core .",
    "such a relatively short timescale is consistent with the lifetime of typical `` starless '' cores ( fuller & myers 1987 ) .",
    "one might argue that the substantial contraction motion in our model `` starless '' cores may have something to do with the particular outer boundary conditions we used : a freely moving pressure boundary .",
    "i have tried several other boundaries , including one with the outer edge of the cloud completely fixed in space .",
    "even in such an extreme case designed to minimize cloud contraction , most of the cloud matter away from the edge still infalls at a speed close to half an isothermal sound speed when the central density increases by a factor of @xmath0 , say from @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xmath3 , as in our reference and improved models . therefore",
    ", substantial inward motion appears to be characteristic of dense `` starless '' cores formed out of roundish magnetized molecular clouds via ambipolar diffusion .",
    "recent molecular line observations by tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( see also myers & mardones 1997 ) and williams et al .",
    "( 1999 ) seem to indicate substantial inward motion of both ions ( n@xmath69h@xmath67 ) and neutrals ( cs ) with velocities up to 0.1 km s@xmath57 in the `` starless '' core l1544 .",
    "an interesting feature of the inward motion , as noted by williams et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , is that the maximum infall speed is essentially the same on both the small ( @xmath132 pc ) and the large ( @xmath133 pc ) scales . within the context of our spherical models ,",
    "such inward motion with velocities comparable to half an isothermal sound speed on both size - scales occurs when the central cloud density enhancement is between roughly @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; beyond @xmath1 , the maximum inward velocity becomes comparable to , or even larger than , the isothermal sound speed .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached for disk - like configurations , as long as the initial mass - to - flux ratio is too far from the critical value ( crutcher 1999 ) and the clouds are not too centrally concentrated to begin with ( li 1999 ) .",
    "another possible example of  starless \" cores with  infall \" signatures is l1498 ( lemme et al . 1995 ) , which shows a pronounced double - peaked cs feature with the blue peak stronger than the red peak .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that not many more such sources are found , especially among more advanced cores ( i.e. , those with higher central densities ) , such as those studied in millimeter dust continuum ( e.g. , andr , ward - thompson & motte 1996 ) .",
    "it seems that a substantial motion is required of `` starless '' cores by their typical size and lifetime , independent of theoretical models : to shrink a dense core of about 0.05 pc in radius by half ( so that the average density would increase by an order of magnitude ) in @xmath131 years demands a contraction speed of @xmath130 km s@xmath57 - about half of the isothermal sound speed of a typical 10 k cloud core .",
    "one possibility is that the expected pre - collapse inward motion shows up in the non - thermal `` turbulent '' component of the velocity dispersion which , interestingly , is also about half of the thermal component for many `` starless '' nh@xmath46 cores ( fuller & myers 1987 ; barranco & goodman 1998 ) .    besides inward motion , another property of dense cores that could be deduced in principle from a variety of observations is the density profile .",
    "it is now established that `` starless '' cores have a plateau - envelope type profile ( with a more - or - less constant density plateau at the center surrounded by an envelope whose density decreases with radius roughly as a power - law ; andr , ward - thompson & motte 1996 ) while the plateau region is absent in `` starred '' cores , in accordance with theoretical expectations ( e.g. , lizano & shu 1989 ; basu & mouschovias 1994 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 ; safier et al .",
    "1997 ; figures  1a and 3a of this paper ; and shu 1977 ) .",
    "observational estimates of the power - index in the envelope in the literature vary from shallower than @xmath134 to steeper than @xmath135 .",
    "theoretical models of ciolek & mouschovias ( 1994 ) based on thin - disk approximation predict a power index between about @xmath136 to @xmath137 for clouds with an initial magnetic pressure much higher than the thermal pressure .",
    "it is substantially shallower than that of an singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath135 )",
    ". it may not be applicable to those cloud cores that have an initial magnetic pressure comparable to , or smaller than , the thermal pressure and thus are more roundish .",
    "in such cases , the calculations presented here suggest that the density profile in the envelope could be considerably steeper .",
    "indeed , taken at the face value , figures  1c and 3c yield a power index close to @xmath138 in our idealized spherical models .",
    "inclusion of magnetic tension may flatten the density profile somewhat , although it is not clear whether it can become as flat as @xmath135 .",
    "it is interesting to note in this regard the 2-d calculations of tomisaka ( 1996 ) , who considered the collapse of relatively weakly magnetized axisymmetric cloud with frozen - in field .",
    "the magnetic tension is taken into account properly .",
    "he find a density profile in the envelope ranging from @xmath139 ( his model a ) to @xmath140 ( his model b ) in the equatorial plane of the cloud .",
    "future 2-d calculations along similar lines but with proper treatment of the magnetic coupling should be able to settle this issue .",
    "observationally , there are some indications that the density profile in the envelope is as steep as @xmath117 , maybe even steeper . in",
    "the best studied case , l1689b , using millimeter dust continuum , andr et al .",
    "( 1996 ) conclude that the power - index of the density profile is consistent with @xmath117 ( perhaps even slightly steeper ; see their figure  3b ) .",
    "an extreme example of steep density profile is given by kane & clemens ( 1997 ) , whose deduced a median apparent volume density profile for a sample of `` starless '' bok globules to be as steep as @xmath141 from molecular line observations . similarly , abergel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concludes from iso absorption observations that the  starless \" dense core , b2 , in @xmath15 oph may have an envelope whose density drops as fast as @xmath142 . in any case , through concrete numerical examples , we have demonstrated the possibility that magnetic pressure may stiffen the equation of state of a magnetic cloud beyond isothermality ( i.e. , making the effective adiabatic index @xmath143 ) .",
    "collapse of polytropic gas spheres with @xmath144 will also lead to a plateau - envelope density profile , with the density power index in the envelope approaching @xmath145 ( yahil 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , stiffening of the equation of state beyond isothermality tends to produce an envelope density profile steeper than @xmath117 .",
    "it is not clear as to what extent such a tendency is geometry - dependent .",
    "an important quantity in the star formation theory is the rate of mass accretion onto the forming protostar . on dimensional grounds",
    ", it should be proportional to @xmath146 ( where @xmath17 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath147 the gravitational constant ; shu 1977 ) , although the value of the proportionality constant is currently under debate . as a starting point for discussion , we consider the well known  inside - out \" collapse model of static , nonmagnetized singular isothermal sphere ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the central compact object is found by self - similarity technique to be @xmath148 for a 10 k gas typical of taurus star formation region , @xmath149 km",
    "s@xmath57 , so that @xmath150m@xmath151yr@xmath57 .",
    "it corresponds to an accretion luminosity of @xmath152 where @xmath14 and @xmath153 are the mass and radius of the central protostar , assuming all of @xmath154 lands directly on the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , for a typical low mass star of @xmath155 m@xmath52 and 3 r@xmath52 , the accretion luminosity predicted by this simple model is about 10 l@xmath52 ( cf , shu 1995 ) . compared with the typical observed luminosity of about 4 l@xmath52 by myers et al .",
    "( 1987 ; see also gregersen et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is too large by only a modest factor of a few .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the model prediction of accretion luminosity and the observed luminosity is sometimes referred to as the  luminosity problem \" in the star formation literature .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the presence of magnetic fields envisaged in the current paradigm .",
    "magnetic fields could enhance mass accretion rate in three ways .",
    "first , compared with nonmagnetic cases , a magnetized cloud core can have a higher initial equilibrium density afforded by the additional magnetic support .",
    "collapse of a denser core leads naturally to a higher mass accretion rate ( li & shu 1997 ) .",
    "second , magnetic fields increase signal speed , leading to a larger collapsing region at any given time , although this increase tends to be cancelled to a large extent by magnetic tension , which retards the collapsing flow ( galli & shu 1993 ) .",
    "the last , perhaps also the most subtle , effect of magnetic fields is to stiffen the equation of state of the cloud ( at least in a spherical geometry ) , leading to a substantial steepening of density profile in the envelope and an increase in the cloud contraction speed .",
    "the net result is the presence of a large initial peak in the mass accretion rate ( safier et al .",
    "1997 ; li 1998 ) , also evident from some of nonmagnetic ( foster & chevalier 1993 ; henriksen , andr & bontemps 1997 ) as well as field - frozen ( tomisaka 1996 ) collapse calculations .",
    "this effect is illustrated most clearly by the our improved model .",
    "the enhancement of magnetic coupling by dust grains yields a more or less homologously collapsing central region of substantial mass . at the end of the cloud evolution in our improved model (",
    "when the central number density reaches a value of @xmath64 @xmath3 ) a region of about @xmath156 m@xmath52 is collapsing toward the center with a speed of @xmath97 km s@xmath57 near its edge at a radius @xmath157 pc . unless slowed down somehow by a strong force , such as the centrifugal force associated with rotation",
    ", the collapse tends to accelerate and all of this mass will reach the origin in less than @xmath158 years .",
    "it would imply a stunning average ( for the first @xmath156 m@xmath52 ) mass accretion rate of more than @xmath159 m@xmath52 yr@xmath57 ! this would produce an enormous accretion luminosity ( of order @xmath47 l@xmath52 from equation [ 24 ] ) if most of the accreted mass is channeled to the stellar surface quickly .",
    "although there are indirect observational indications that the mass accretion rate may be as much as ten times higher in the `` class 0 '' phase than in the `` class i '' phase ( see andr 1997 for a review ) , ways must be found to reduce the above estimate by two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "a proper inclusion of magnetic tension will undoubtedly reduce the mass accretion rate somewhat , although the extent of such a reduction is unclear at present .",
    "this potentially serious `` luminosity problem '' for spherical models makes two dimensional treatments of the cloud evolution with appropriate magnetic coupling all the more pressing .",
    "another way of reducing the mass accretion rate is through outflows .",
    "powerful molecular outflows are generated early on in the protostellar mass growth process .",
    "they are observed in most of the youngest , the so - called `` class 0 '' , sources ( e.g. , barsony 1994 ) and many older , `` class i '' sources , and should play a role in reversing the mass accretion ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ; velusamy & langer 1998 ) .",
    "otherwise , mass in the envelope will keep falling towards the center , building up a star much more massive than the half solar mass of a typical low - mass star .",
    "the accretion reversal process could be extremely efficient .",
    "indeed , observations of l1551 irs 5 indicate that the mass outflow rate on a sizescale of order 2000 au is inferred to be comparable to , or even larger than , the mass infall rate ( fuller 1994 ) .",
    "details of the infall - outflow interaction remains to be worked out .",
    "a third possibility is to store the accreted mass in a circumstellar disk .",
    "the stored mass may be gradually fed onto the central star , perhaps mainly in short bursts as envisioned in hartmann et al .",
    "however , it is unlikely for the circumstellar disk mass to exceed the stellar mass much , because of gravitational instabilities .",
    "alternatively , most of the accretion luminosity in the disk could be released in a nonradiative form , spent perhaps in driving powerful outflows ( bontemps et al .",
    "either way , the implications for the evolution of protostellar disks in general , and the proto - solar nebula in particular , would be profound .",
    "as a step towards a quantitative understanding of the star formation process , i have followed numerically the evolution of magnetized , spherical clouds whose magnetic pressure is initially equal to the thermal pressure throughout the cloud . to gauge the dynamical effects of dust grains , i considered two models for the magnetic coupling coefficient , which controls the dynamical evolution of the cloud . in one model ,",
    "the coupling coefficient is specified at a canonical value of @xmath51 . in the other ,",
    "it is evaluated self - consistently from ionization equilibrium , taking into account of dust grains with a standard mrn size distribution .",
    "my main conclusions are :    \\(1 ) substantial pre - collapse inward motion is expected of dense cores formed out of roundish magnetic clouds due to ambipolar diffusion . in our specific models , an inward speed of order half an isothermal sound speed",
    "is achieved over much of the ( 10 m@xmath52 ) cloud when the central density increases by a factor of @xmath0 above its initial value , say from @xmath1 to @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "such inward motion may have been observed recently in the `` starless '' core l1544 ( taffala et al .",
    "1998 ; williams et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it may explain why typical `` starless '' cores last only for a few times @xmath2 years ( beichman et al .",
    "1986 ; shu 1995 ) , not much longer than their dynamical timescale",
    ". the subsonic pre - collapse motion could also be the origin of the small but significant nonthermal component of linewidths observed in many `` starless '' cores .",
    "\\(2 ) as found previously by several other authors , `` starless '' cores formed out of magnetic clouds always have a flat central plateau surrounded by an envelope whose density decreases with radius roughly as a power - law .",
    "our model calculations suggest that the slope in the envelope is significantly steeper than those obtained by mouschovias and collaborators , who considered disk - like , rather than sphere - like , clouds with an initial magnetic pressure much higher than the thermal pressure .",
    "\\(3 ) dust grains of a standard mrn size distribution can enhance the magnetic coupling coefficient above the canonical value of 10 considerably ( nishi et al .",
    "the enhancement peaks somewhere between @xmath126-@xmath104 @xmath3 , with a maximum value about an order of magnitude higher than the canonical value .",
    "the enhanced coupling allows the cloud matter to trap the magnetic flux better during the advanced , more dynamic phase of the core formation . in the idealized spherical geometry , the trapping of flux creates a central region of substantial mass that collapses almost homologously . in our particular example , more than half a solar mass can reach the center in less than @xmath1 years , greatly exacerbating the accretion `` luminosity problem '' of star formation .",

    "<S> it highlights the pressing need for two - dimensional , fully dynamic models that treat the coupling between the magnetic field and the cloud matter properly .    </S>",
    "<S> the model clouds exhibit substantial inward motion during the late stage of core formation , with velocities of order half the isothermal sound speed or more over most of the cloud , after a central density enhancement of about @xmath0 ( say from @xmath1 to @xmath2@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such pre - collapse motion may have been detected recently by taffala et al . and </S>",
    "<S> williams et al . in the `` starless '' core l1544 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion may also explain why `` starless '' dense cores typically last for only a few dynamic times and why they have small but significant non - thermal linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> the clouds that i study have relatively low - mass ( of order 10 @xmath4 ) and an initial magnetic pressure comparable to the thermal pressure . </S>",
    "<S> they evolve into a density profile of a flat central plateau surrounded by an envelope whose density decreases with radius roughly as a power - law , as found previously . </S>",
    "<S> the density decline in the envelope is significantly steeper than those obtained by mouschovias and collaborators , who considered disk - like magnetic clouds whose initial magnetic pressure is much larger than the thermal pressure .    as the cloud density increases above approximately @xmath2@xmath3 , dust grains become dynamically important . </S>",
    "<S> depending on their size - distribution , dust grains can enhance the coupling coefficient between the magnetic field and the neutral cloud matter by as much as an order of magnitude or even more . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced coupling makes it difficult for magnetic flux to escape during the advanced , more dynamic phase of the core formation . </S>",
    "<S> in spherical geometry , this trapping of magnetic flux leads to an almost homologous collapse of a central region with substantial mass . </S>",
    "<S> the implied extremely rapid assemblage of protostellar mass , with more than half a solar - mass material reaching the origin in about @xmath1 years or less for a typical set of cloud parameters , poses a serious accretion `` luminosity problem '' . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic tension in two - dimensional models may help alleviate the problem . </S>"
