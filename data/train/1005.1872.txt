    "experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices,@xcite as well as pump - probe spectroscopy with femtosecond time - resolution@xcite and transport measurements on quantum dots@xcite enable a systematic investigation of strongly interacting quantum many - particle systems under nonequilibrium conditions . in a pump - probe experiment , a material",
    "is excited with a strong laser pulse , and its subsequent evolution is probed by a second pulse that reaches the sample at a controlled time - delay .",
    "the breakdown of the mott insulating phase within a few times of the inverse hopping has been observed in this way.@xcite ultracold gases in optical lattices , on the other hand , can be prepared in an equilibrium state and suddenly quenched out of equilibrium by modifying a hamiltonian parameter.@xcite these experiments can address fundamental questions such as the thermalization in isolated quantum systems.@xcite    the ongoing experimental progress has stimulated intensive research on the theoretical side . while many theoretical approaches that are designed for the investigation of correlated systems in thermal equilibrium must be modified considerably before they can be used to compute the real - time evolution , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite is an approximate scheme which is per se applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.@xcite the method relies on a mapping of lattice models to a single impurity model , which is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions,@xcite and provides a good basis for the realistic simulation of many correlated materials.@xcite nonequilibrium dmft",
    "has so far been used , e.g. , to study transport beyond linear response in the falicov - kimball model,@xcite as well as interaction quenches and interaction ramps in the falicov - kimball model@xcite and in the hubbard model.@xcite in the last part of this paper we will use dmft to study the response of the mott insulating phase to a periodic modulation of the hopping or the interaction,@xcite similar to what can now be done in experiments with cold atomic gases.@xcite    currently , the biggest challenge within the context of nonequilibrium dmft is the development of impurity solvers which allow to compute the long - time dynamics after a perturbation .",
    "an exact solution , via a closed set of equations of motion , is known only for the falicov - kimball model.@xcite for the hubbard model , continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) can in principle be used to obtain an unbiased solution.@xcite both the weak - coupling expansion@xcite and the strong - coupling expansion@xcite of the relevant anderson impurity model have been translated from their respective imaginary - time variants ( refs .   and",
    "for weak - coupling and ref .   for strong - coupling ) to the keldysh formalism , in order to study the real - time evolution .",
    "however , in these real - time monte carlo calculations , the accessible times are limited by the notorious dynamical sign problem .",
    "a big advantage of the weak - coupling expansion over the strong - coupling expansion is that the diagrammatic series simplifies in the case of particle - hole symmetry.@xcite on the other hand , the sign problem in a weak - coupling calculation increases with the interaction strength .",
    "it is thus essentially impossible to use ctqmc to study complex excitation processes within the mott insulating phase , e.g. , the excitation with a short laser pulse and the subsequent relaxation .    in order to avoid the sign problem and access the regime of strong interactions and relatively long times",
    ", we explore the direct summation of the self - consistent diagrammatic hybridization expansion up to fixed order , as opposed to ctqmc , which is in essence a stochastic summation of the full ( non self - consistent ) series .",
    "this approach proves to be very accurate in a wide paremeter regime and suitable for the calculation of the real - time dynamics .",
    "systematic approximations for the expansion around the atomic limit of the anderson impurity model have been used for a long time.@xcite the simplest conserving approximation , which has been termed non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , can correctly recover the kondo temperature @xmath1 when charge fluctuations are suppressed by the coulomb interaction @xmath0 , although the fermi - liquid behavior for @xmath2 is not correctly reproduced.@xcite if @xmath0 is finite , however , the width of the kondo resonance is severely underestimated , and various resummation schemes of the expansion have been devised to cure this problem.@xcite already the simplest to nca within these schemes , the so called one - crossing approximation ( oca ) , can cure the deficiencies of nca to a large extent . motivated by the fact that nca is already very good in the insulating parameter regime , gull _",
    "et al._@xcite recently developed a bold - line hybridization expansion , i.e. , an approach which is based on a monte carlo sampling of the corrections beyond nca .",
    "starting with the work of pruschke , cox , and jarrell,@xcite both the nca and the oca have been used as an impurity solver for dmft ( for some recent references that involve the investigation of real materials , see refs .  ) .",
    "furthermore , nca and its corrections can readily be translated into the keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium situations , although the evaluation of higher - order diagrams in real time involves quite some numerical effort .",
    "for example , the buildup of the kondo resonance after a sudden shift of the impurity level in the kondo model has been investigated with nca.@xcite the fairly accurate results in equilibrium calculations and the straightforward portability to the keldysh contour make the self - consistent hybridization expansion an interesting candidate for the solution of the impurity problem within nonequilibrium dmft .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we give a detailed description of the self - consistent expansion on the keldysh contour ( sections .",
    "[ sec - def ] and [ sec - nca ] ) , and we benchmark the method by applying it to the interaction quench in the hubbard model on the bethe - lattice ( sec .  [ sec - qmccomparison ] ) .",
    "we find similar trends for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium : while nca is unreliable unless the interaction @xmath0 is much larger than the bandwidth , oca provides an important correction , and the third order is in almost quantitative agreement with qmc results over a wide parameter range which includes the insulating phase and the crossover regime between metal and insulator . as an application of the perturbative impurity solver we then study the excitation of a mott insulator by a time - dependent modulation of the hopping or the interaction strength ( sec .  [ sec - spectroscopy ] ) . because the interaction is rather large in this problem , a solution using weak - coupling ctqmc is currently not feasible .",
    "to describe a nonequilibrium situation in which the system is prepared in a thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath3 for times @xmath4 and later acted on by some perturbation , we use the keldysh formalism.@xcite the imaginary - time contour of the matsubara green s functions for finite - temperature equilibrium states is thereby extended to the l - shaped contour @xmath5 that runs from @xmath6 to time @xmath7 ( i.e. , the largest time of interest ) along the real axis , back to @xmath6 , and finally to @xmath8 along the imaginary time axis ( fig .",

    "furthermore , we have studied the double occupancy @xmath256 as a function of time after small interaction quenches . in the crossover regime ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath256 is drastically changing , which is most clearly evidenced by the disappearence of the gap in the fourier transform of @xmath256 .",
    "although the absolute changes of the double occupancy are small , its time - evolution may thus yield a sensitive probe of the metal - to - insulator crossover in the hubbard model .    an interesting next step would now be to repeat similar calculations in a more realistic setup , e.g. , on a cubic lattice .",
    "a careful comparison of results from the self - consistent hybridiation expansion up to second and third order , and from ctqmc ( for small times ) will allow to make definite experimental predictions , such as for the modulation spectrum in the insulating phase and the crossover regime , and for the saturation behavior of the double occupancy .",

    "<S> we solve the impurity problem which arises within nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory for the hubbard model by means of a self - consistent perturbation expansion around the atomic limit . while the lowest order , known as the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , is reliable only when the interaction @xmath0 is much larger than the bandwidth , low - order corrections to the nca turn out to be sufficient to reproduce numerically exact monte carlo results in a wide parameter range that covers the insulating phase and the metal - insulator crossover regime at not too low temperatures . as an application of the perturbative strong - coupling impurity solver we investigate the response of the double occupancy in the mott insulating phase of the hubbard model to a dynamical change of the interaction or the hopping , a technique which has been used as a probe of the mott insulating state in ultracold fermionic gases . </S>"
