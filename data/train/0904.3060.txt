    "consider a collection of items in a database , characterized by some property with values on the real line .",
    "sorting these items means arranging them in an ordered sequence according to their property values .",
    "the purpose of sorting is to facilitate subsequent searches of that database for items with known values of the property @xcite .",
    "the best classical algorithm uses @xmath2 queries to find a desired item out of an ordered list of n items , while a quantum computer can solve the problem using a constant factor fewer queries .",
    "the best known lower bound shows that any quantum algorithm for the problem requires at least @xmath3 queries @xcite .",
    "the algorithm obtained by farhi , goldstone , gutmann , and sipser , uses @xmath4 queries , showing that a constant factor speedup is indeed possible @xcite .",
    "the best published exact quantum algorithm for the problem uses @xmath5 queries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of finding one or more desired items out an unsorted database .",
    "patel has shown that if the database quantum queries , then mere digitization is sufficient for efficient search for one desired item .",
    "the algorithm , called factorized quantum search algorithm , presented by him can locate the desired item in an unsorted database using @xmath0 queries to facorized oracles @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the algorithm would not work if it is used to search more than one desired items out of an unsorted database , or the property values among which it is searching for the desired item are not distinct . from the point of view of unsorted database manipulation , we consider the problem with more than one desired items in an unsorted database and with the property values that are not distinct from each other . and",
    "we present a quantum search engine , based on the factorized quantum search algorithm , that can solve the problems .",
    "our goal is achieved by introducing auxiliary files for the property values that are not distinct , and converting the searching request into a sequence of calls to factorized quantum search algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we review quantum random access memory , structured query language , and factorized quantum search algorithm . in section iii , we present our quantum search engine , discuss how to digitize the property values of an unsorted database , which might be distinct from each other or not , and discuss how to convert a complex query request into a sequence of calls to the factorized quantum search algorithm .",
    "we also discuss how the factorized quantum search algorithm works on an actual quantum computer with the unsorted database existing in the quantum random access memory . in section iv",
    ", we give several examples to show how the quantum search engine works .",
    "we conclude the paper in section v.",
    "a quantum random access memory ( qram ) uses nqubits to address any quantum superposition of n memory cells .",
    "it means the qram can perform memory accesses in coherent quantum superposition @xcite : if the quantum computer needs to access a superposition of memory cells , the address register a must contain a superposition of addresses @xmath6 , and the qram will return a superposition of data in a data register d , correlated with the address register : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the content of the jth memory cell @xcite .",
    "giovannetti , lloyd and maccone have presented an architecture that exponentially reduces the requirements for a memory call : @xmath9 switches need be thrown instead of the n used in classical ram designs , which yields a more robust qram algorithm than conventional ( classical and quantum ) designs .",
    "see @xcite for more details .      structured query language ( sql ) is a tool widely used in manipulating the classical databases @xcite.basic operations in sql include inserting a new record to a database file ( insert ) , updating an existing record ( update ) , deleting an exiting record ( delete ) , selecting ( select ) and performing an arbitrary operation on some records , backing up a portion of a database ( backup ) . and restoring the backup ( restore ) @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used operation among them might be the select operation , which is defined as :    ( 180,160 )    ( 0,145 ) select [ all @xmath10 distinct [ on ( expression [ , ... ] ) ] ]    ( 0,135 ) * @xmath10 expression [ as output_name ] [ , ... ]    ( 0,125 ) [ into [ temporary @xmath10 temp ] [ table ] new_table ]    ( 0,115 ) [ from from_item [ , ... ] ]    ( 0,105)[where condition ]    ( 0,95 ) [ group by expression [ , ... ] ]    ( 0,85 ) [ having condition [ , ... ] ]    ( 0,75 ) [ union @xmath10 intersect @xmath10 except [ all ] select ]    ( 0,65 ) [ order by expression [ asc @xmath10 desc @xmath10    ( 0,55)using operator ] [ , ... ] ]    ( 0,45)[for update [ of class_name [ , ... ] ] ]    ( 0,35 ) [ limit count @xmath10 all [ offset @xmath10 , start ] ]    ( 10,20)fig .",
    "definition of the select operation    the select statement is used to form queries for extracting information out of the database .",
    "the details about how to use it and the other basic operations can be found in @xcite . we only show several examples , about the select operation , useful for our discussion below .",
    "assume that we have such a table as follows stored in the database , and the name of the table is table1 .",
    "( 120,110 ) ( 40,60 )    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the union of the results of f(id,=,960112 ) , f(a,=,960113 ) , and",
    "f(a,=,960114 ) gives the results of example 2 , which can be seen in table 3 .",
    "and the intersection of the results of example 1 and 2 is the result of example 3 , which can be seen in table 4 .",
    "we have considered the problem of finding one or more desired items out of an unsorted database . the factorized quantum search algorithm presented by patel",
    "can locate one desired item in an unsorted database using o(log4n ) queries to factorized oracles .",
    "but the algorithm can only solve the problem finding the desired item out of an unsorted database with only one target item .",
    "we extend the algorithm to solve the problem with more than one target items in an unsorted database .",
    "the goal is achieved by introducing auxiliary file , and converting a complex query request into a sequence of simple queries , and finally into a sequence of calls to the factorized quantum search algorithm .",
    "the query complexity of our algorithm is @xmath1 , where p is the number of the potential simple query requests in the complex query request , q is the maximum number of calls to the factorized quantum search algorithm of the simple queries , m is the number of the auxiliary files for the property on which our algorithm are searching for desired items .",
    "we know that the query complexity of the best classical algorithm to select p*q items from a sorted database is @xmath11 . when compared with the classical algorithm on either sorted or unsorted database , if m is small , the quantum search engine on unsorted database presented in the paper is more efficient .",
    "the most important thing implied in this paper is that to manage an unsorted database on a quantum computer is possible and efficient . though a query algorithm on a sorted database can be more efficient than a query algorithm on an unsorted database",
    ", the sorting price might be very high .",
    "so the quantum search algorithm presented in this paper offers another way to database management on an actual quantum computer ."
