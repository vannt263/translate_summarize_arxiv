    "the intermolecular interactions between conjugated polymers and oligomers in the condensed phase  whether in the solid state or in solution  entail a fundamental interest in the emerging field of molecular electronics , as they are decisive factors in the electronic and structural properties of these materials .",
    "the orientation and alignment of polymers in a solid matrix , the formation of aggregates in films and solution , or the ability of organic semiconductors to self - assemble are the outcome of a complex balance between the spatial features of the molecules and the substrate , and the interactions between them at the conditions of synthesis.@xcite@xmath1 @xcite by dictating rules for aggregation , these interactions eventually shape properties such as charge delocalization and mobility@xcite@xmath1@xcite or optical@xcite@xmath1@xcite and electromechanical@xcite response .",
    "thiophene - derived oligomers and polymers represent today one of the most promising class of organic semiconductors , finding potential applications in a variety of electronic and electroactive devices.@xcite@xmath1@xcite semiconducting properties arise with doping , therefore much of the basic research performed on these systems has addressed in particular the doped or oxidized species . since the early nineties electrochemical and spectroscopic evidence was gathered indicating that oxidized oligothiophenes reversibly associate in solution.@xcite@xmath1@xcite in a recent study,@xcite we have outlined how this association is driven by three contributions : the attractive @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions , the coulombic repulsion , and the solvent effects . in the case of oligothiophene cations dimers ,",

    "a polarizable dielectric medium favors concentration of charge in a small cavity , reverting the balance from net repulsion to attraction and stacking .    in the present paper",
    ", we employ a recently developed first - principles approach recently developed to describe the effect of a continuum solvent within the density - functional theory framework,@xcite and use it to explore the role of polarity and surface tension in the stabilization of dimers of polythiophene and oligothiophene radical cations .",
    "furthermore , we examine the possibility of trimer formation as an intermediate step toward the nucleation of higher - order aggregates , and to gain insight on self - assembly in solution . in charged dimers , at variance with the case of neutral dimers governed by van - der - waals forces , interactions are predominantly covalent and electrostatic , and density - functional theory ( dft ) has proven to be sufficiently accurate when compared with highly - correlated quantum - chemistry methods.@xcite in our approach , the contribution of the surface tension to the solvation free energy is computed in a very natural fashion , as the product between the area of the cavity and the surface tension of the solvent.@xcite this contribution is particularly important in dimerization processes , where the merging of two cavities into one provides an additional stabilizing term associated to the minimization of the total area of the cavity .",

    "solvation is described with a continuum model recently implemented by us in the quantum - espresso package and described in detail in reference  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the solvent is represented as a dielectric medium surrounding a quantum - mechanical solute confined in a cavity delimited by an isosurface of electronic charge density . adopting a common decomposition of the solvation free energy @xmath3 we have : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the electrostatic , the cavitation , and the dispersion - repulsion contributions respectively.@xcite in our implementation @xmath5 and @xmath6",

    "we briefly review the approaches used to obtain @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the variation in the dielectric constant at the solvent - solute interface is controlled by two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which determine the size of the cavity and the smoothness of the transition region .",
    "these are the only parameters entering the model , and our chosen values , @xmath12=0.00078 @xmath14 and @xmath13=1.3 , represent a rather universal choice.@xcite    the cavitation term is computed as the product between the surface tension of the solvent @xmath15 and the area of the cavity , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the surface of the same cavity employed in the electrostatic part of the solvation energy and is defined by an isosurface of the charge density .",
    "this area can be easily and accurately calculated by integration in a real - space grid , as the volume of a thin film delimited between two charge density isosurfaces , divided by the thickness of this film .",
    "this idea has been originally proposed by cococcioni et al.@xcite to define a `` quantum surface '' in the context of extended electronic - enthalpy functionals : @xmath18 -\\vartheta_{\\rho_0+\\frac{\\delta}{2 } } \\left [ \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\times \\frac{|\\nabla \\rho ( { \\bf r})|}{\\delta}.\\ ] ] the finite - differences parameter @xmath19 determines the separation between two adjacent isosurfaces , one external and one internal , corresponding to density thresholds @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the spatial distance between these two cavities  or the thickness of the film  is given at any point in space by the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the ( smoothed ) step function @xmath23 is zero in regions of low electron density and approaches 1 otherwise , and it has been defined consistently with the dielectric function @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "crystallographic data@xcite and recent calculations@xcite on oxidized dimers have indicated that the stacking of oligothiophene cations follows a `` slipped '' pattern where the layers are shifted along the molecular axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ terthdimer ] .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the energy as a function of the lateral shift for oxidized terthiophene and polyquaterthiophene dimers in acetonitrile ( @xmath0=35.7 and @xmath15=28.7 mn / m ) at a fixed intradimer separation of 3.4 @xmath24 . in the calculations involving the terthiophene oligomers , dirichlet boundary conditions in the electrostatic potential were applied , and the size of the unit cell was large enough to eliminate any significant interactions between the periodic images . in the case of the polymers ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used along the _ z _ axis ( the molecular axis ) , keeping the dirichlet boundary conditions in the other directions .",
    "the total charge of these systems is + 2 ( in the polymer , there is a positive charge every four thiophene rings ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ displ ] : both the oligomer and the polymer exhibit a similar pattern , with a global minimum at 2.3 @xmath24 for the terthiophene and 2.0 @xmath24 for the polyquaterthiophene . a local minimum at 0.0 @xmath24 ( where the two layers are overlapping ) is present in both cases .",
    "interestingly , the net binding is very sensitive to the lateral shift , varying steeply in a range of 10 kcal / mol as one layer is slipped over the other . at shifts of about 1 @xmath24 off the minima , the @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction between the cations appears clearly weakened , resulting in an unbound dimer .",
    "the nature of the solvent does nt have any significant effect on this characteristic pattern , even if it affects the magnitude of the interaction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ displs ] , where the terthiophene curve is displayed for three different media : acetonitrile , dichloromethane ( @xmath0=8.9 , @xmath15=27.2 mn / m ) and water ( @xmath0=78.8 , @xmath15=72.2 mn / m).(we have chosen water as a case study given its distinctive polarity and surface tension , despite the low solubility exhibited by thiophene derivatives in this solvent . ) fig .",
    "[ evsdt ] explicitly illustrates the role of the solvent in the binding of the terthiophene cations , by showing the interaction energy as a function of the intradimer distance at a fixed lateral shift of 2.3 @xmath24 .",
    "the binding energies are close to 5 kcal / mol for dichloromethane and acetonitrile , and 12 kcal / mol in water .",
    "these energies can be seen as a lower limit for the absolute value of the dimerization enthalpy @xmath25 , since the effect of the ionic environment was neglected in the calculations ( the counterions in solution would differentially stabilize the doubly - charged terthiophene dimer compared to two terthiophene cations .",
    "this effect has been recently discussed by jakowski and simons@xcite for dimers of tetracyanoethylene anions , [ tcne]@xmath26 ) .",
    "in fact , dimerization enthalpies between 7 and 14 kcal / mol have been reported for different terthiophene derivatives in apolar solvents.@xcite@xmath1@xcite the interplanar separations corresponding to the minima , in the range of 3.4 to 3.5 @xmath24 , are consistent with the distance of 3.47 @xmath24 obtained for substituted terthiophene cations in the solid state.@xcite fig .  [ evsdp ] compares the potential energy surface of the oligomer with the one corresponding to the polymer ( the later was calculated at a fixed lateral shift of 2.0 @xmath24 ) .",
    "the equilibrium distance turns out around 0.3 @xmath24 larger in the periodic system , although it exhibits a slightly stronger binding .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental data showing that @xmath25 is enhanced by the length of the chain , @xcite a trend related to a `` dilution '' of the coulombic repulsion as the ratio between charge and oligomer size decreases.@xcite at the same time , however , the increase in length at a given oxidation state would diminish the ratio between unpaired electrons available to @xmath2-@xmath2 bonding and thiophene rings , what would presumably revert the aforementioned binding trend starting from certain molecular weighs.@xcite    the separate roles played by the dielectric screening of the solvent and its surface tension in the stabilization of the dimer are highlighted in fig .",
    "if the contribution of @xmath6 were omitted , the binding curves would turn out to be very close to each other ( fig .",
    "[ cav]a ) .",
    "the larger @xmath15 in the case of water ( 72.2 mn / m versus 28.7 mn / m in acetonitrile ) is responsible for the deeper minimum in the potential energy surface .",
    "the net effect of the surface tension is to minimize the area of the solvation cage , monitored in fig .",
    "[ cav]b as the cations are pulled apart . beyond a separation of about 4.75 @xmath24",
    "the surface remains constant , indicating that the single cavity has split and each cation is enclosed in a separate cavity of area independent of the interplanar distance .",
    "in this situation there is no cavitation energy gain and therefore the curves excluding and including @xmath6 ( open and closed symbols in fig .",
    "[ cav]a respectively ) overlap on the right part of the plot .    the potential energy curves in fig .",
    "[ cav]a unveil an intriguing possibility : that the binding energy is not directly related to the dielectric constant of the solvent , as our intuition may suggest .",
    "this hypothesis is explored in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] , where the interaction energy between two terthiophene cations separated by 3.6 @xmath24 is plotted as a function of the dielectric constant , ignoring the contribution of the surface tension .",
    "the results are somehow unexpected : a rather small increase in the permittivity with respect to the vacuum limit rapidly stabilizes the dimer , but once the dielectric constant is above 10 the effect of a further increase in polarity is very small .",
    "this behavior can be rationalized considering that a polarizable dielectric medium with low permittivity is already enough to screen most of the coulombic repulsion between the two charges and to favor aggregation of these charges by polarizing itself .",
    "we note in passing that the positive drift observed at higher permittivities for the case of @xmath12=0.00078 @xmath14 is an artifact of the continuum model .",
    "since the dielectric constant is defined as a continuous function of the electron density , its value throughout the intradimer region may depart from 1 , allowing the dielectric medium to fill some of the space between the cations and to interfere , though modestly , with the @xmath2-@xmath2 bond .",
    "this effect will be enhanced at large values of @xmath0 and @xmath12 . in reality , instead , the solvent does not penetrate the intradimer space if the separation is 3.6 @xmath24 , regardless of @xmath0 .",
    "this spurious behavior is in fact absent in the curve computed with @xmath12=0.0003 in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] .",
    "what is remarkably captured by the continuum model is the saturation effects of polarity on the dimerization , occurring already for very low dielectric constants .",
    "these results are pretty much consistent with experimental observations that turn down a direct correlation between dimerization trends and polarity of the medium , while emphasizing the dependence on solubility of the oligothiophenes.@xcite to understand the effect of the solvent on @xmath25 , then , one should consider other properties such as surface tension or specific interactions between the solute and the medium",
    ".    are the thermodynamic and structural features found so far for the dimerization applicable to the stacking of multiple oligomer layers ?",
    "it would be very interesting to know if or how the present results can be extended to processes such as aggregation and self - assembly in solution , involving the collective pairing of many oligothiophene units . in an attempt to offer an answer ,",
    "even if preliminary , to this question , we have studied the formation of trimers of terthiophene cations in acetonitrile .",
    "[ trimer ] depicts the two configurations of minimum energy obtained for the trimer in acetonitrile , in which the third cation is shifted by + or - 2.3 @xmath24 with respect to the next oligomer . as shown in fig .",
    "[ trimerevsl ] , where the interaction energy is plotted as a function of the lateral shift of the third cation , there is no significant energetic difference between these two minima .",
    "the curve corresponding to the dimer is plotted in the same figure : the pattern of valleys and peaks is preserved at the same lateral displacements when increasing the number of layers from two to three .",
    "the differences in the relative depths of these curves can be ascribed to the fact that the same interplanar separation of 3.4 @xmath24 was adopted in the calculation of both , but the optimal separation in the trimer is longer , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ trimerevsd ] .",
    "this graph shows the interaction energy calculated for the trimer in acetonitrile as a function of the interplanar separation between layers ( the interplanar separation between the first and the second layer is the same as between the second and the third at each point of the curve ) . for meaningful comparison with the dimer , depicted in the same graph ,",
    "the energies were normalized to the number of @xmath2-pairs , in this case two .",
    "interestingly , the binding between two cations does nt seem to be impaired by the presence of a third one : the interaction between stacks remains almost constant , even though the equilibrium distance increases in about 0.1 @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the energetic and structural results found for the cation dimers can be applied , to a large extent , to the case of more complex , larger aggregates consisting of multiple layers .",
    "our study has highlighted the separate roles of surface tension the dielectric screening in the stabilization of charged thiophene oligomers and polymers stacks .",
    "the surface tension of the solvent is a driving force toward the minimization of the cavity area , and therefore toward dimerization : there is an energetic payoff in accommodating two solutes in a single cavity of an area smaller than twice the one corresponding to the dissociated components . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the dimer stability on the polarity of the solvent alone is less evident .",
    "a dielectric effect is necessary to screen the electrostatic repulsion and to stabilize the charges in a small volume , but once the permittivity has reached a certain threshold , a further increase in polarity has a negligible contribution to the stabilization of the system .",
    "this observation is probably general to any @xmath2-dimer of charged radicals  an hypothesis that could be interesting to test through explicit calculation .",
    "the formation of trimers follows the same geometrical arrangement as the dimerization .",
    "a @xmath2-bond on one of the oligomer planes does not seem to significantly affect the bond on the other .",
    "these results point to the conclusion that the organization of aggregates and stacks is governed by the same thermodynamics that is already manifest in the dimerization .",
