    "indeed , every interior vertex has only one degree of freedom , and as a result any two dihedral angles adjacent to a vertex are related by an equation : @xmath3 in a generic case , the solution set of this system is discrete , that is the polyhedron can not be deformed .",
    "a natural question is to find all special shapes that allow isometric deformations .",
    "antonios kokotsakis , a student of carathodory , studied these polyhedra in his phd thesis in 1930 s . as a result , he found a necessary and sufficient condition for the infinitesimal flexibility and described several classes of flexible polyhedra , @xcite . at the same time , sauer and graf @xcite studied the case @xmath4 and also found several flexible special cases .",
    "we give a complete classification of flexible kokotsakis polyhedra with quadrangular base : @xmath4 .",
    "our approach is based on a diagram of branched covers between riemann surfaces constructed as follows .",
    "a substitution @xmath5 transforms @xmath6 into a polynomial equation @xmath7 with @xmath8 . by allowing @xmath9 to take complex values we arrive at a riemann surface @xmath10",
    "with two coordinate projections @xmath11 which form the following diagram @xmath12 \\ar[d ] & \\cp^1 & c_{41 } \\ar[l ] \\ar[d]\\\\ \\cp^1 & & \\cp^1\\\\ c_{23 } \\ar[r ] \\ar[u ] & \\cp^1 & c_{12 } \\ar[l ] \\ar[u ] } \\ ] ] now , if a polyhedron is flexible , then there are paths in @xmath13 whose projections to the common @xmath14 s coincide",
    ". these paths can be lifted to a bigger diagram involving fiber products of @xmath15 and @xmath13 , see section [ sec : diagcovers ] for more details . to find the conditions under which this big commutative diagram exists , we study the branch points of the involved branched covers .",
    "this approach is close in spirit to ritt s solution of the problem of composite and commutative polynomials , @xcite .",
    "the equation of the configuration space has the form @xmath16 this is a special case of the so called euler - chasles correspondence , which describes in the generic situation an elliptic curve .",
    "the flexibility of a kokotsakis polyhedron is equivalent to the composition of several correspondences of the form being the identity ( to be more exact , having an identity component ) .",
    "compositions of euler - chasles correspondences were studied by krichever @xcite in the context of the quantum yang - baxter equation .    in the rigidity theory ,",
    "elliptic curves came up in the works of connelly and v.  alexandrov @xcite who studied flexible bipyramids .",
    "actually , a correspondence appears each time when one has to do with deformations of a quadrilateral preserving its edge lengths . in our case",
    "this is a spherical quadrilateral associated with a vertex of degree four .",
    "the fact that the configuration space of a quadrilateral with fixed edge lengths is in general an elliptic curve was discovered by darboux @xcite .",
    "darboux derived from it a porism on quadrilateral folding , which fell into oblivion and was rediscovered several times since then .",
    "removing a neighborhood of a face of an octahedron yields a kokotsakis polyhedron with a triangular base ; conversely , by extending the faces of a @xmath17-kokotsakis polyhedron one obtains an octahedron ( or a projectively equivalent polyhedron ) .",
    "both operations preserve the flexibility .",
    "therefore flexible kokotsakis polyhedra represent one possible generalization of bricard s octahedra .",
    "this was noted already by kokotsakis , and recently used by nawratil @xcite . as a generalization of bricard s flexible polyhedra ,",
    "gaifullin @xcite studies flexible cross - polytopes in space - forms of arbitrary dimension , using euler - chasles correspondences .    a kokotsakis polyhedron with a quadrangular base can be viewed as a part of a quadrangular mesh , see figure [ fig : quadmesh ] .",
    "it is easy to see that a simply connected piece of a quadrangular mesh is flexible if and only if each of its kokotsakis subpolyhedra is .",
    "quad surfaces are a natural analog of parametrized smooth surfaces , and have been studied in this context since about a century , see the book @xcite .",
    "there was a recent surge of interest to quad surfaces .",
    "first , they give rise to various discrete integrable systems , @xcite .",
    "second , they have obvious applications in the architectural design @xcite : curved facades and roofs made of quadrangular glass panels can be found in abundance in the modern cities .",
    "third , flexible kokotsakis polyhedra ( a special case called miura - ori ) found application in industry as solar panels for spacecraft @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : algreform ] we survey recent works of karpenkov @xcite , stachel @xcite and nawratil @xcite that inspired the present paper .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] introduces the notation , provides more details on the previous work on the subject as well as on the approach used in the present work .",
    "it also explains the terminology used in section [ sec : list ] to list all flexible kokotsakis polyhedra and describe their properties .",
    "in section [ sec : confspace ] the configuration spaces of spherical four - bar linkages are classified , and their equations and parametrizations are written down .",
    "section [ sec : couplings ] does a similar job for couplings of two four - bar linkages , with an emphasis on two classes : involutive and reducible couplings .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : proof ] the diagram of branched covers associated with a flexible kokotsakis polyhedron is subject to a thorough analysis based on the results of two previous sections , which results in the proof of main theorem .",
    "vertices of a kokotsakis polyhedron and the values of its planar angles at the interior vertices are denoted as on figure [ fig : notplanangles ] .",
    "clearly , it is only a neighborhood of the base face @xmath18 that matters : replacing , say , the vertex @xmath19 by any other point on the half - line @xmath20 does not affect the flexibility or rigidity of the polyhedron .",
    "we will assume that all planar angles lie between @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",

    "however , the analysis of the diagram is still complicated enough , and we bring more structure in it by distinguishing certain sorts of couplings .    first , a coupling @xmath64 is called _ involutive _ , if its configuration space @xmath55 carries an involution that changes the value of @xmath44 but preserves @xmath65 : @xmath66 this means that the involutions @xmath67 on @xmath68 and @xmath69 are compatible : @xmath70 .",
