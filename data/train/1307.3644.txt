    "the prompt ( or direct ) photon production at high energies is an important tool to study the hard subprocess dynamics , since the resulting photons are largely insensitive to the effects of the final state hadronization .",
    "it is a subject of a special interest since , in particular , measurements of total and differential cross sections of prompt photons can be used to constrain the parton densities in a proton . in the electron - proton collisions at hera , the zeus and h1 collaborations previously reported data@xcite on the production of prompt photons in photoproduction events , where the virtuality of the exchanged photon @xmath7 is lower than 1 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations@xcite underestimate these data by 3040% , especially in rear pseudo - rapidity ( electron direction ) region , and the observed disagreement is difficult to explain within conventional theoretical uncertainties connected with scale dependence and parametrizations of the parton densities @xcite .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , the hera data can be reasonably well described by calculations @xcite performed in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization qcd approach@xcite , which is based on the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl)@xcite dynamics of parton evolution - factorization formalism . ] .",
    "very recently new preliminary results for prompt photon photoproduction cross sections ( both inclusive and associated with the hadronic jet ) have been reported@xcite by the zeus collaboration . in the present note",
    "we apply the @xmath0-factorization approach of qcd for the analyses of these data .",
    "note that our previous consideration@xcite was based on the off - shell @xmath9 partonic amplitudes for direct ( @xmath10 ) and resolved photon ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) contributions to the photon cross section , where the non - zero transverse momenta of initial quarks and gluons were properly taken into account .",
    "here we reconsider our previous calculations and take into account @xmath14 subprocesses , namely @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in the case of photon and associated jet production ,",
    "it allows us to take into account the kinematics of the accompanied jet more accurately as compared with the previous consideration ( see discussion in section  3 ) .",
    "additional motivation for our study is that similar consideration@xcite , based on the off - shell @xmath15 subprocesses , results in a better description of the tevatron data on the associated photon and heavy ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) quark jet @xcite as compared to the nlo pqcd predictions @xcite .",
    "moreover , we take into account @xmath18 contributions from the box @xmath5 subprocess and @xmath5 subprocesses , but keep true off - shell kinematics . see section 2 for more details . ] , which is known to be sizeable@xcite since the high gluon density region is partially reached . following to our previous considerations@xcite , we apply kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) prescription@xcite to define the unintegrated ( or transverse momentum dependent ) quark and gluon densities in a proton .",
    "this approach is a simple formalism to construct the unintegrated parton distributions from the known collinear ones .",
    "we calculate total and differential inclusive and jet associated prompt photon production cross sections , perform a systematic comparison of our predictions with the available h1 and zeus data@xcite and estimate the theoretical uncertainties of our predictions .",
    "the outline of our paper is following . in section  2",
    "we recall shortly the basic formulas of the @xmath0-factorization approach",
    ". in section  3 we present the numerical results of our calculations and discussion .",
    "section  4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the previous investigation@xcite in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization approach was based on @xmath19 off - shell subprocesses , namely @xmath20    where the subprocess ( [ gq ] ) represents the direct production mechanism , and the subprocesses ( [ qq ] )  ( [ gq ] ) represent the single resolved photon ones , in which the initial photon fluctuated into a hadronic state and a gluon and/or a quark from this hadronic fluctuation takes part in the hard interaction , give also the @xmath19 contributions since the parton densities in a photon at leading - order have a behavior proportional to @xmath21 . ] . in the present note",
    "we concentrate on @xmath22 subproccesses : @xmath23    where the relevant four - momenta are given in the parentheses . additionally ,",
    "for the first time in the framework of @xmath0-factorization , we take into account box contribution : @xmath24    this subprocess , formally is of @xmath25 , is known to be sizeable@xcite due to high gluon luminosity in the probed kinematical region and it was taken into account in the standard qcd calcualtions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams for the subprocesses under consideration are shown on figs .",
    "[ 2to3 ] and  [ box - graph ] .",
    "note that , in contrast with the collinear qcd approximation , the subprocesses ( [ gq ] )  ( [ qg ] ) are effectively included in ( [ gq1 ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) in the @xmath0-factorization approach , and only subprocess ( [ gq ] ) stays out .",
    "however , according to the estimates in @xcite , this mechanism gives only a few percent contribution to the cross section in the kinematical region covered by the h1 and zeus experiments , so we can neglect it .",
    "we neglect also the contributions from the so - called fragmentation mechanisms since the the isolation cut application @xcite reduces these contributions to less than 10% of the visible cross section .",
    "note that the isolation cuts and additional conditions which preserve our calculations from divergences were specially discussed in @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for the subprocesses ( [ gq1 ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath26    where @xmath27    and @xmath28    here @xmath29 is the electric charge , @xmath30 is the ( fractional ) charge of quark having mass @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the strong charge , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the polarization four - vectors of the corresponding particles and @xmath37 is the eight - fold color index .",
    "note again that in ( 8) we neglected the transverse momentum of initial quark .",
    "the calculation of the off - shell matrix elements listed above is straightforward .",
    "here we would like to only mention that , according to the @xmath0-factorization prescription @xcite , the summation over the incoming off - shell gluon polarizations is carried out with @xmath38    where @xmath0 is the gluon non - zero transverse momentum .",
    "for the photons and outgoing on - shell gluon the summation over their polarizations can be performed with the usual covariant formula : @xmath39    in other respects we follow the standard qcd feynman rules . the evaluation of the emerging traces was done using the algebraic manipulation system form @xcite .",
    "finally , concerning the box contribution ( 7 ) , the corresponding amplitude squared was calculated a long time ago in the on - shell limit @xmath40 .",
    "the simple analytical expression can be found , for example , in@xcite . in our phenomenological study",
    ", we apply this expression , however we keep the exact off - shell kinematics ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "according to the @xmath0-factorization prescription , to calculate the cross section one should convolute off - shell partonic cross sections with the relevant unintegrated ( transverse momentum dependent ) quark and/or gluon distributions in a proton . in the present paper",
    "we use the kmr approximation@xcite to determine it .",
    "the kmr approach is a formalism to construct the unintegrated parton densities @xmath41 from the known collinear parton distributions @xmath42 , where @xmath43 or @xmath44 . in this approximation",

    "the theta functions which appear in  ( [ fq ] ) and  ( [ fg ] ) imply the angular - ordering constraint @xmath47 specifically to the last evolution step to regulate the soft gluon singularities .",
    "the sudakov form factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 which appear in ( [ fq ] ) and ( [ fg ] ) enable us to include logarithmic loop corrections to the calculated cross sections ) and ( [ fg ] ) we applied the mstw2008 parton distributions @xcite . ] .",
    "the contributions to the prompt photon cross sections from subprocesses ( 5 )  ( 7 ) can be easily written as follows : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the total center - of - mass energy of the collision , @xmath54 is the azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to @xmath55 axis . ] of initial quark or gluon having fraction @xmath56 of the initial proton longitudinal momentum and non - zero transverse momentum @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the transverse energy , rapidity and azimuthal angle of the produced photon , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the rapidities and azimuthal angles of the outcoming partons , respectively .",
    "the experimental data@xcite refer to the prompt photon production in @xmath65 collisions , where the electron emits a quasi - real ( @xmath66 ) photon .",
    "thus @xmath67 cross sections ( 26 )  ( 28 ) should be weighted with the photon flux in the electron : @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the fraction of the initial electron energy carried by the photon in the laboratory frame .",
    "we use here the weizacker - williams approximation for the bremsstrahlung photon distribution from the electron : @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the electron mass , @xmath72 and @xmath73  gev@xmath8 , which is a typical value for the recent photoproduction measurements at the hera collider .    the multidimensional integration in ( 26 ) ",
    "( 28 ) has been performed by means of the monte - carlo technique , using the routine vegas@xcite .",
    "the full c++ code is available from the authors on request .",
    "now we are in a position to present our numerical results .",
    "first we describe our theoretical input and the kinematical conditions .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales were taken as @xmath74 , where the parameter @xmath75 was varied between 1/2 and 2 about the default value @xmath76 to estimate the scale uncertainties of our calculations .",
    "we neglected quark masses and used the standard lo formula for the strong coupling constant @xmath77 with @xmath78 massless quark flavours and @xmath79 mev , such that @xmath80 .",
    "the experimental data for the inclusive prompt photon photoproduction at hera were taken by both the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "the h1 data@xcite were obtained in the following kinematical region : @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 .",
    "the fraction @xmath69 of the electron energy transferred to the photon is restricted to the range @xmath83 .",
    "very recent zeus measurements@xcite refer to the region defined by @xmath81 gev , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the case of jet",
    "associated prompt photon photoproduction the restrictions on the prompt photon transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity are the same as in the inclusive production case . for the jets , the cuts which were applied in the h1 and zeus analyses are @xmath86 gev , @xmath87 and @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the data@xcite were obtained with the electron energy @xmath90 gev and the proton energy @xmath91 gev .",
    "the transverse energy and pseudo - rapidity distributions of the inclusive prompt photon production are shown in figs .",
    "[ inclusive - h1 ]  [ inclusive - zeus ] in comparison with the h1 and zeus data@xcite . in the left panels ,",
    "the solid histograms correspond to the predictions obtained from ( 26 )  ( 28 ) at the default scale .",
    "the dashed histograms represent the corresponding theoretical uncertainties estimated as it was described above .",
    "we find that our predictions reasonably well describe a full set of the available experimental data .",
    "moreover , the shape and absolute normalization of the measured cross sections are adequately reproduced within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "additionally we plot predictions based on the @xmath92 subprocesses ( 1 )  ( 4 ) , as it was done in our previous paper@xcite ( dotted histograms in the left panels ) subprocesses based results differ a little from the ones presented in @xcite , since the former have been obtained with the mstw parton distributions instead of older grv94 set as the input for kmr . ] .",
    "one can see some enhancement of the calculated cross sections due to , in particular , the box subprocess ( 7 ) included into our present consideration .",
    "the relative contributions of different subprocesses to the prompt photon cross section are shown on the right panels of figs .",
    "[ inclusive - h1 ]  [ inclusive - zeus ] .",
    "we find that while the subprocess ( [ gq1 ] ) dominates , the box subprocess ( [ box ] ) contributes significantly to the predicted cross section , specially at negative photon pseudorapidities . in this region ,",
    "the box contribution is comparable with the contribution from the subprocess ( [ gg ] ) , and it amounts up to @xmath6 of the total cross section of inclusive prompt photon production .",
    "now we turn to the prompt photon production associated with the hadronic jet . in the previous consideration@xcite , to calculate the semi - inclusive production rates some approximation was applied .",
    "so , it was noted that the produced photon is accompanied by a number of partons radiated in the course of the parton evolution . on the average ,",
    "the parton transverse momentum decreases from the hard interaction box towards the proton . as an approximation",
    ", it was assumed that the parton @xmath93 , emitted in the last evolution step , compensates the whole transverse momentum of the parton participating in the hard subprocess , i.e. @xmath94 . all the other emitted partons are collected together in the proton remnant , which is assumed to carry only a negligible transverse momentum compared to @xmath95 .",
    "this parton gives rise to a final hadron jet with @xmath96 in addition to the jet produced in the hard subprocess . from these hadron jets the one carrying the largest transverse energy",
    "has been choosen @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the same approximation .",
    "however , since we use @xmath15 rather than @xmath97 subprocesses , the jet production kinematics is described more accurately than it was done previously , because of the production of jets mainly comes from the hard subprocesses .",
    "our numerical predictions are shown in figs .",
    "[ h11 ]  [ zeus2 ] ( on the left panels ) in comparison with the h1 and zeus data @xcite .",
    "the relative contributions of different subprocesses are shown in the right panels .",
    "one can see that the situation is very similar to the inclusive production case .",
    "the reasonably good description of the data for a number of measured distributions is achieved except for the distributions on the @xmath98 , where we see some disagreement in the shape .",
    "the same shape disagreement in the @xmath98 distributions is observed in the predictions based on the @xmath97 subprocesses ( 1 )  ( 4 ) .",
    "the possible reason of such discrepancy can be connected with the approximation for the jet determination which was described above and which was used in both type of calculations .",
    "note that the predictions based on the former scheme give the results tending to underestimate the data , while the approach based on the @xmath15 subprocesses ( 5 )  ( 7 ) shows a better agreement .",
    "we find that the box contribution ( 7 ) is important in the photon and jet associated production case also .",
    "one can see that its contribution is comparable with the @xmath99 subprocess .",
    "other important variables in prompt photon photoproduction investigations are the longitudinal momenta of the partons in the colliding particles . the momentum fraction of the initial photon is introduced in the zeus analyses@xcite as the following : @xmath100    at @xmath101 the cross section is dominated by the direct initial photon contributions , whereas at lower @xmath102 the resolved photon contribution dominate .",
    "the h1 collaboration refers to @xmath103 and @xmath104 observables@xcite given by : @xmath105    our predictions for these observables are shown in figs .",
    "[ x - zeus ]  [ x - h1 ] in comparison with the h1 and zeus data .",
    "we demonstrate that , in the framework of @xmath0-factorization , the subprocesses ( [ gq1 ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) allow us to take into account both direct and resolved contributions without introducing any parton densities in a photon .",
    "one can see that the direct region with @xmath106 is dominated by the subprocess ( [ gq1 ] ) , which incorporates the contribution from the subprocess ( [ gq ] ) . in the resolved photon region , where @xmath107 , the contribution of the subprocess ( [ gg ] ) becomes more important , since it contains the single resolved photon contribution ( [ qg ] ) .",
    "we point out that the approach based on the @xmath108 subprocesses ( 5 )  ( 7 ) shows a better agreement with the data at intermediate @xmath109 compared with the approach based on the @xmath97 subprocesses ( 1 )  ( 4 ) .",
    "this is a result of more accurate treatment of jet production kinematics achieved in a presented approach .",
    "we have reconsidered the inclusive and associated jet prompt photon photoproduction at hera in the framework of @xmath0-factorization qcd formalism .",
    "the proposed approach is based on the @xmath1 off - shell amplitudes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 partonic subprocesses .",
    "similar consideration had a success in the description of the tevatron data on the associated photon and heavy quark jet taken by the d0 and cdf collaborations @xcite .",
    "we have taken into account also the @xmath4 box contributions @xmath5 to the production cross sections .",
    "the unintegrated ( or transverse momentum dependent ) parton densities in the proton have been determined using kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) prescription .",
    "we have demonstrated that the present approach results in a better agreement with the hera data in contrast with the previous @xmath0-factorization predictions based on the @xmath97 subprocesses .",
    "we find that the box contribution is sizeable and amounts up to @xmath6 of the calculated total cross section .",
