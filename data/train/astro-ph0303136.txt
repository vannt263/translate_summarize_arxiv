    "many low - mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter lmxbs ) are known to show type - i x - ray bursts which have proven to be important diagnostic tools for these systems ( see lewin , van paradijs & taam 1995 for a review ) .",
    "x - ray bursts are thought to originate from thermonuclear flashes , caused by thermal instabilities , in the accreted matter on the surface of weakly magnetized neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "the time interval between the bursts ranges from tens of minutes to days . in a source",
    "the burst activity can stop for periods from days to months ( but also years , as , for example , in the case of transient sources ) . in some cases , a relation has been observed between burst properties and persistent flux .",
    "as the persistent flux increases the recurrence time between bursts tends to increase ( typically from a few hours to more than a day ) and the bursts become less energetic ( e.g. , hoffman , lewin & doty 1977 ) . for instance , in the case of 4u  170544 the persistent flux increased by a factor @xmath7 while the burst intervals increased by a factor of @xmath8 ( langmeier et al .",
    "1987 ; gottwald et al .",
    "1989 ) . when the persistent flux increases further the bursts disappear completely .",
    "this behaviour is observed in several sources like , for example , mxb  165929 ( lewin , hoffman & doty 1976 ) , gx  3 + 1 ( makishima et al . 1983 ) and exo 0748673 ( gottwald et al . 1986 ) . however , in other sources ( e.g. 4u  182030 : clark et al .",
    "1977 ; 4u  172834 : basinska et al .",
    "1984 ) the opposite behaviour was sometimes observed : the recurrence time between bursts decreased while the persistent flux increased .",
    "nevertheless , at least in the case of 4u 182030 ( clark et al . 1977 ) , the bursts ( again ) disappear for higher acretion rates , when the source is in its high state .",
    "current theories of type - i x - ray bursts ( fujimoto et al . 1981 ; fushiki and lamb 1987 ; see bildsten 2000 ) predict three different regimes in mass accretion rate for unstable burning : i ) mixed h / he burning triggered by thermally unstable h ignition , at low accretion rates ( @xmath9 @xmath10/yr ) ; ii ) pure he shell ignition following steady h burning , at intermediate accretion rates ( @xmath11 @xmath10/yr @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath10/yr ) ; iii ) mixed h / he burning triggered by thermally unstable he ignition at high accretion rates ( @xmath13 @xmath10/yr @xmath12 @xmath14 @xmath10/yr ) . at @xmath15 even higher steady he burning occurs , the nuclear fuel for the burst is depleted , causing the bursts to disappear completely . on the basis of these theories ,",
    "an anticorrelation between persistent flux and burst recurrence time is expected ; since as @xmath15 increases a lower amount of time is needed to accumulate the critical amount of fuel necessary to begin the burst , the recurrence time between bursts is expected to decrease with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "this is contrary to what is observed ( e.g. , hoffman , lewin & doty 1977 ; van  paradijs , penninx & lewin 1988 ) .",
    "there are basically two interpretations for these observations .",
    "van paradijs et al . (",
    "1988 ) found evidence of a continuous stable burning of accreted nuclear fuel in burst sources ; the observed correlation between persistent emission and burst recurrence time can be explained as the rate of this stable burning , increasing , removes nuclear fuel for thermonuclear flash .",
    "recently , bildsten ( 2000 ) proposed that another solution of this mismatch between theory and observations can be obtained by relaxing the hypothesis of spherical accretion and assuming that the accretion of fresh material only occurs on a fraction ( e.g. , the equator ) of the ns surface .",
    "the crucial parameters , in this case , is the accretion rate per unit area : if the covered area increases enough with increasing @xmath15 , the accretion rate per unit area indeed decreases .",
    "indeed , the whole scenario is not completely clear yet , since recent results ( e.g. muno et al . 2000 ; franco 2001 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2001 ) suggest that there is not a unique trend between @xmath15 and burst properties for all the sources .",
    "type - i x - ray burst profiles depend strongly on photon energy : decays are much shorter at high photon energies than at low photon energies ( lewin et al .",
    "this softening of the burst spectrum during the decay results from the cooling of the ns photosphere . if the luminosity during the burst reaches the eddington limit @xmath16 , the ns photosphere expands .",
    "since for a blackbody ( see below ) @xmath17 , when the radius of the photosphere r expands , the effective temperature @xmath18 decreases ( tawara et al . 1984 ; lewin , vacca & basinska 1984 ; vacca , lewin & van paradijs 1986 )",
    ".    in this paper we report on the discovery of type - i x - ray bursts from the lmxb 4u 170840 ( forman et al .",
    "1978 ) during a bepposax observation .",
    "not much is known about this system . a first analysis of the 212  kev x - ray spectrum of 4u 170840 was made by warwick et al .",
    "( 1988 ) using exosat observations during which the 26  kev source flux was @xmath19  erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum was well fitted by a power law with a spectral index @xmath20 and a column density n@xmath21  @xmath3 .",

    "the 1999 bepposax data are fitted with an absorbed power law or a comptt model plus a gaussian emission line , the 2001 bepposax data with an absorbed power law plus a blackbody component and the rxte data with an absorbed cutoff power law plus a blackbody .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      we have analysed the six x - ray bursts of the 1999 bepposax observation .",
    "we do not have enough statistics to select different intervals during the bursts and analyse the rise and decay spectra separately .",
    "therefore we have analysed six spectra ( one for each burst ) each averaged over the whole @xmath46 s burst duration . from these spectra",
    "we have subtracted the spectrum of the persistent emission and fitted them with a blackbody component . in table",
    "[ tabspecb ] we show the results of the fits for each of the six bursts .",
    "note that , because the spectra of the bursts soften significantly during the observation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) the fit parameters , such as blackbody color temperatures , have to be considered average estimates over the bursts .",
    "we have analysed two bepposax observations ( taken in 1999 and 2001 ) and rxte observations ( taken in 1997 and 2000 ) of and discovered this source to be an x - ray burster .",
    "this allows us to classify as a ns system . in the 1999 bepposax observation we found six bursts .",
    "five bursts have a rapid rise ( @xmath47  s ) with a slow decay ( @xmath48  s ) , and one has a triangular shape , although it shows spectral properties similar to those of the other bursts .",
    "the fluxes of the persistent emission in the rxte observations and in the 2001 bepposax observation are @xmath49 and @xmath50 times , respectively , higher than the flux of the persistent emission in the 1999 bepposax observation .",
    "while we observe six bursts during the 1999 bepposax observation we do not observe any burst during the rxte observations and during the 2001 bepposax observation .",
    "this would be in agreement with the general behaviour of x - ray bursters : the bursts disappear above a certain flux value due to steady nuclear burning ( e.g. , van paradijs et al .",
    "1979 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1988 ; see lewin et al .",
    "1995 for a review ) .",
    "several sources show a correlation between the peak flux and the fluence of the bursts ( e.g. sztajno et al .",
    "1983 ; basinska et al . 1984 ; lewin et al .",
    "some of them also show a saturation in the peak flux at high fluences , which has been explained by the fact that the luminosity has reached a critical value that can be interpreted as the eddington limit luminosity .",
    "one of the best examples is mxb 1728 - 34 ( basinska et al . 1984 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ; galloway et al .",
    "this property can be used to infer the distance @xmath51 to the source . in fig .",
    "[ f - e ] we plot the flux at the peak @xmath52 ( calculated using the count rate at the peak of the burst in the 0.3  s resolution light curve ) versus the fluence @xmath53 ( the average bolometric flux times the duration of the burst ) for each of the six bursts of .",
    "the plot shows an approximately linear correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "although we do not see a saturation of @xmath52 in this correlation ( and therefore we can not derive the eddington luminosity and the distance to the source ) we can at least give an upper limit to the distance assuming the highest peak flux of the bursts to be less than @xmath16 . since @xmath54 erg s@xmath4 ( assuming @xmath55 and correcting for gravitational redshift ; van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) , taking the bolometric flux at the peak of the first burst ( @xmath56 erg  @xmath3s@xmath4 ) , we obtain @xmath57  kpc , not a stringent constraint . since the source is in the direction of the galactic center we assume 8  kpc as the source distance . at 8  kpc saturation",
    "would occur at 4 times this flux level .",
    "c    c    note that , as was pointed out by many authors , sometimes not all the accreted fuel is burned during the burst event , and the presence of a residual fuel can have significant implications for the lack of regularity of the burst behaviour ( ayasly & joss 1982 ; hanawa & fujimoto 1984 ; woosley & weaver 1985 ; lewin et al . 1995 ) . to investigate this point",
    "we have also calculated the values of @xmath58=(gm / r)/@xmath59 ( an observational quantity defined as the ratio of the average total energy in the persistent emission to that emitted in the burst ) which is expected to be @xmath60 for a thermonuclear burst in the mixed hydrogen / helium burning regime ( _ e.g. _ , lewin et al .",
    "we measure @xmath61 for all the bursts , but one , starting from the first burst .",
    "given that the accretion rate is consistent with being constant , this implies a correlation between the time interval during which matter accretes onto the ns and the energy emitted in the following burst .",
    "the only exception is the last burst for which , assuming that the fifth and the sixth bursts are consecutives , we find a value for @xmath58 that is much larger than 40 ( @xmath62 ) . in fig .",
    "[ f - np ] we plot the fluence of the bursts as a function of the time interval between each burst and the previous one .",
    "there is a clear trend of the fluence to increase with the time interval for all the bursts , except the sixth .",
    "this trend is in agreement with the behaviour of other sources ( lewin et al .",
    "1995 for a review ) and with the expectation that the longer the burst interval is , the larger is the amount of nuclear fuel available for the burst .",
    "the sixth burst seems not to follow this trend .",
    "most probably we have missed some bursts in between the fifth and the sixth because of the presence of gaps ( see  2 ) .",
    "indeed , we find a gap about 3000  s before the sixth burst , just where , following the correlation in fig .",
    "[ f - np ] , we would expect to find another burst .",
    "based on the observed persistent flux and the distance to the source , we can estimate the accretion rate and therefore the burning regime expected in this case .",
    "we find @xmath63/yr .",
    "this corresponds to the mixed hydrogen / helium burning regime triggered by thermally unstable hydrogen ( fujimoto et al . 1981 ; fushiki and lamb 1987 ; see also bildsten 2000 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath64 we find for almost all the bursts .",
