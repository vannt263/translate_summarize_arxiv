    "the outflows drive more mass off the disk , wind - i90 in particular .",
    "this outflow creates an asymmetric cavity in the center of the galaxy as the wind continues to direct strong ram pressure out along the disk through the duration of the simulation .",
    "+    the winds break out of the disk between 2 and 2.25 myr after initialization , whereas the jet breaks out after only 1.4 myr , allowing its cocoon to begin growth and effect the host more quickly .",
    "only after the jet breaks through the disk , do the bubble evolution and feedback begin to differ from the winds .",
    "the bubbles resulting from the winds seem to grow at a similar pace , as shown in figure [ fig : rho_slice ] which displays face on and edge on slices of the density for all four simulations .",
    "the bubble growth from the winds is in agreement with the analytical theory of bubble expansion in a uniform environment , as shown in figure [ fig : rad_vel_ramp ] .",
    "though the jet itself has extreme ram pressure , the bubble it generates has a ram pressure typically an order of magnitude smaller than those generated from the winds , as shown in the ram pressure slices in figure [ fig : ram_p_slice ] and in agreement with analytical theory plotted in figure [ fig : rad_vel_ramp ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ram_p_slice ] shows clearly that the high ram pressure in wind - i90 is directed straight into the high density disk for the duration of the simulation , continuously compressing this gas .",
    "this makes a substantial difference in subsequent star formation , as we discuss in section [ sec : feedback_to_stars ] .",
    "although the jet breaks out of the disk more quickly , the cocoons in all the simulations have roughly the same velocity , @xmath40 1,000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the higher the inclination of the wind is , the more the clumpy ism changes the direction and speed of the outflow . in wind - i90 in particular , we see the development of asymmetric high velocity eddies and channels . in jet - i0 ,",
    "the velocities of the dense gas along the disk are the smallest , even when compared to wind - i0 . in these two simulations , a thick ring of slow moving gas lies in the plane of the disk , with this ring being much thicker in the jet simulation .",

    "the outflow simulations with wind - i90 , however , continues to create regions of high pressure where the wind strikes the disk directly .",
    "the temperature within the wind bubbles are roughly the same , around @xmath83 k. the jet , on the other hand , creates regions close to the jet but also close to the disk that are extremely hot , greater than @xmath84 k ( but as expected for a hot plasma with highly relativistic electrons ) , shown in figure [ fig : gal_temp_ram_p_slice_large2d ] .",
    "however , because the jet cocoon is under - dense relative to the wind cocoons , the thermal pressure is roughly the same .",
    "we also see much greater fluctuation in temperature in the cocoon of wind - i90 .",
    "+     +     +    our simulations show that jets are expected to have a greater impact on the cgm than winds for two reasons .",
    "while winds create spherical bubbles , jet cocoons grow to a more conical shape with peaks that extend much further than the radius of the winds bubbles .",
    "the jet cocoon extends beyond 30 kpc and the wind bubbles achieve radii of only 16 kpc , roughly the radius of the galaxy .",
    "second , as a result of the low densities and high velocities within the jet cocoon relative to the wind bubbles , the jet cocoon has a much higher temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : gal_temp_ram_p_slice_large2d ] shows slices of the temperature and ram pressure for all four simulations 12.5 myr after the beginning of the agn feedback . because of the extended structure and higher temperature , jets are more likely to impede accretion of gas onto the galaxy than winds are . additionally , the jet cocoon is more likely to strike an extra - galactic cloud or satellite because of its larger size .",

    "first , feedback to the more diffuse gas is typically stronger .",
    "this means more efficient transfer of momentum and energy , and higher resulting velocities .",
    "second , as a result of the bubble s expansion through the disk in all the simulations , there is a time delay for feedback to the larger radii along the disk .",
    "third , the feedback from a jet happens much more quickly than in the simulations with the outflows .",
    "the radial velocity of the host s gas in all the simulations reveals both more efficient feedback to the diffuse gas than the dense gas and the time delay to larger radii , as shown in figure [ fig : spherical_velocity ] . for the dense gas at radii less than 8 kpc , the mass - weighted mean radial velocities reach velocities of 100 km s@xmath5 in all four simulations . in all four simulations ,",
    "the diffuse gas is accelerated to higher velocities at larger radii , typically reaching 100 km s@xmath5 between 8 and 12 kpc and 1,000 km s@xmath5 between 12 and 16 kpc .",
    "these reflect the bubble itself , which comprises all the gas with densities greater than 0.1 @xmath24at radii greater than 16 kpc , essentially outside the original galaxy .",
    "in fact , at radii greater than 16 kpc , the bow shock of the bubble can climb to densities greater than 1 @xmath24and has a velocity of 1,000 km @xmath87 , which impacts the cgm .",
    "differences arise at larger radii .",
    "the diffuse gas at radii greater than 16 kpc is accelerated to 1,000 km s@xmath5 by the jet in less than 4 myr because of the large velocity of the jet and the bow shock of the jet . in both jet - i0 and wind - i0 , we see that the velocity of the dense gas at radii between 8 and 12 kpc ends up around 10 km s@xmath5 .",
    "however , as the inclination in the outflow simulations increases , the velocity of the same gas climbs to nearly 100 km s@xmath5 in wind - i90 , indicating that the inclination of the outflow actually has a larger impact at larger radii .",
    "most of the kinetic energy injected from the jet or wind into the host ends up as kinetic energy in the host s gas , rather than in its internal energy .",
    "figure [ fig : ke_int ] shows the ratio between the kinetic energy and internal energy of the host s gas , a ratio that depends more strongly on radius than on density in all four cases . within 16 kpc ,",
    "the ratio for both the dense and diffuse gas begins and ends with similar values , typically around a value of 100 .",
    "however , for the diffuse gas at radii larger than 16 kpc , more of the energy is thermal rather than kinetic , particularly in the case of the jet where high internal energy diffuse gas can be found at distances greater than 32 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "again , we see this ratio develops more quickly in the case of a jet than in the case of the winds , particularly at radii greater than 16 kpc .",
    "most of the energy deposited by the jet or wind goes to the kinetic energy of the gas , and the efficiency with which kinetic energy and momentum are transferred to the host s gas shows that jet feedback is energy - driven and wind feedback is momentum - driven .",
    "figure [ fig : ke_pt ] shows the ratio of kinetic energy of the host s gas to the injected kinetic energy .",
    "again , we see the jet and jet cocoon transfer kinetic energy to the host more quickly than the outflows , especially at the larger radii . for all gas with a density greater than 0.1 @xmath24within a radius of 64 kpc , we see that this ratio approaches 1 for the jet , indicating the feedback is energy - driven . however , for the same gas in the case of all of the winds , the ratio approaches 0.1 , indicating a substantially less efficient energy transfer .    the mechanical advantage , which is the ratio of radial momentum to the time - integrated injected momentum , reflects that the winds are also closer to momentum - driven .",
    "figure [ fig : ma ] shows that for all gas with a density greater than 0.1 @xmath24within a radius of 64 kpc , the mechanical advantages of the winds end far closer to 1 than that of the jet .",
    "again , we see the jet transfers momentum to the host s gas faster than the winds do .",
    "we see the mechanical advantage decrease with increasing radius for the dense gas and vice versa for the diffuse gas , which is not generally true for the kinetic energy to injected kinetic energy ratio .",
    "a helpful way of examining agn impact on host morphology is to analyze the fraction of space and mass occupied by gas of certain densities . the volume filling factor and the mass filling factor plots shown in figure [ fig : filling_factor ] show similar evolutions in which the volume and mass occupied by high density gas increase for 10 - 12 myr after which they decrease , with the exception of wind - i90 . in that simulation ,",
    "the volume and mass fraction occupied by high density gas continue to increase through the duration of the simulation .",

    "the jet has not yet broken out of the galaxy , and thus all the kinetic energy goes toward very dense gas , creating regions of high density being compressed by high ram pressure and high thermal pressure , causing subsequent star formation . however , after the jet breaks out of the galaxy , the rate of increase of sfr slows . around this time in the wind simulations , the winds break through this disk . in wind - i90",
    ", however , the wind continuously pushes straight out along the disk and compresses the surrounding dense gas throughout the simulation .",
    "the kinetic energy in the other simulations is no longer deposited directly into the disk , rather it goes into the bubble . for this reason ,",
    "only the sfr in the wind - i90 simulation increases at the same rate throughout the simulation .",
    "after 5 myr , the increase of the sfrs in jet - i0 , wind - i0 and wind - i45 slows down , but remain remarkably similar to one another . with respect to star formation , only a significantly different inclination makes a difference , while the power of the wind or jet is the critical component .",
    "analogous to the similarity of the sfr s in the four cases , the locations of stars formed during the agn feedback are also similar .",
    "figure [ fig : time_disk_r ] shows the radius of star formation versus the time of formation . as in @xcite , a ring of star formation begins at a radius of roughly 2 kpc at 1 myr after feedback begins and moves outward radially in all four simulations as a consequence of the bow shock from the cocoons expanding through the disk .",
    "also common to all four simulations is the stimulation of star formation at radii greater than 6 kpc beginning around 6 myr after feedback begins resulting from the compression of the disk from the expanding bubble .",
    "not surprisingly , the pattern is extraordinarily similar in jet - i0 , wind - i0 , and wind - i45 , with the final ring of star formation finishing between radii of 3 and 6 kpc about 15 myr after the jet or wind initialization .",
    "the main difference is again with wind - i90 , where the wind pushes straight into the disk for 15 myr . in this simulation ,",
    "the ring of star formation is closer to an oval extending from 3 kpc to nearly 9 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : star_time_mass ] shows the mass - weighted locations of star formation along with the mean times of star formation for those locations .",
    "it shows an inside - out pattern of star formation shown in figure [ fig : time_disk_r ] and discussed above . in this central region ,",
    "star formation is quenched quickly after the jet or wind begins in all four simulations , as reflected by the mean time of star formation .",
    "the spatial distribution of star formation matches the spatial distribution of gas , including the asymmetries in wind - i45 and wind - i90 . in both jet - i0 and wind - i0 , the jet and wind form a very circular cavity of gas in the central region of the galaxy , with star formation tracing the edge of this cavity , forming a clear circle . in wind - i45 , this region is more oval than in jet - i0 and wind - i0 , and in wind - i90 it looks more oval still , tracing the direction of the wind .",
    "additionally , in wind - i90 more than any of the other simulations , the wind seems to have caused star to form along paths moving radially away from the galactic center , probably through accelerating clouds of gas that continue to form stars as they move .",
    "this is because a higher fraction of the wind s kinetic energy is directed straight into the disk , compressing and accelerating clouds of gas that form stars .",
    "stars formed as a result of agn feedback have positive radial velocities , particularly those formed in the dense rings of stars at radii from 3 - 6 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : radial_v_r ] is a phase plot of the radial velocity of formed stars versus the radius of formation .",
    "the distribution of these velocities is similar between all the simulations , with the distribution of high velocities from wind - i90 extending further than in the other simulations , as reflected from the thicker ring of star formation shown in [ fig : time_disk_r ] .",
    "when analyzing this plot , it is important to remember that the star particles formed in these simulations are formed with the velocities of the gas in their birth cells , and it is reasonable to assume that the velocities of stars formed in these cells will be smaller .",
    "analysis in @xcite addresses star formation as a consequence of high velocity agn winds and shows that the velocities of the resulting stars will not be as high as the wind or the surrounding gas .",
    "+     +     +     +      observations of agn feedback are very difficult for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that some of the most interesting cases are at high redshift .",
    "one of the better ways to quantify the internal dynamics of a host galaxy is to measure the velocity dispersion along the line of sight . in theory , however , this approach can be problematic because of the angle of observation dependence and the asymmetric three - dimensional geometry of agn . to quantify this dependence on geometry ,",
    "we show the density - weighted velocity dispersion of absorption lines as a function of observation angle for various times for all four simulations in figure [ fig : vel_phi_2 ] .",
    "the first conclusion is the clear dependence on angle of observation , particularly at earlier times .",
    "not surprisingly , both the jet and the wind - i0 simulations show much higher dispersions when looking down the jet or wind , a half angle of roughly 45@xmath88 , rather than looking at the galaxy edge on .    in the first few myr of feedback from both the jet and the winds ,",
    "the observed velocity dispersion can vary 2.5 orders of magnitude depending on the angle of observation . between 1 and 2 myr",
    "after the jet is initialized , velocity dispersions in the host can reach over 1,000 km s@xmath5 because the jet breaks through the disk in this window .",
    "after 5 myr , the maximum dispersion in the galaxy with the jet can exceed the minimum dispersion by up to 1.5 orders of magnitude , whereas in the case of the winds the disparity exceeds 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "these results indicate that the angle of observation of absorption lines is important to the measured dispersions , particularly in the early stages .",
    "another notable feature of this analysis is the temporal difference in the evolution of the velocity dispersion as a function of observation angle . in the galaxy that hosts the jet",
    ", the velocity dispersion reaches its final distribution far more quickly than in galaxies with conical winds . with the jet",
    ", this evolution takes just over 3 myr after initialization , whereas with the winds it takes roughly 7 myr .",
    "this is a common theme with respect to feedback in general . because the jet breaks out of the disk faster than the winds , it deposits its kinetic energy and momentum to the host in a much shorter time than winds , as shown in figures [ fig : ke_pt ] and [ fig : ma ] .",
    "because the kinetic powers are all the same and the thermal powers are nearly the same , the jet and winds interaction with the disk and resulting bubbles make the difference to the feedback .",
    "we observe more thermalization in the case of the jet , leading to more energy - driven feedback . in the case of the winds ,",
    "the smaller disparity in densities results in less thermalization .",
    "the feedback from the winds is momentum - driven and increasingly energy - driven with time , though not nearly to the same degree as with the jet .",
    "energy - driven feedback depends on the thermal energy the jet deposits at the terminal shock .",
    "conversely , the wind feedback is strongly dependent on its heavy momentum .",
    "our simulations exhibit many features in agreement with past observations and simulation .",
    "the locations of the star forming regions agree well with observations of a radio quiet quasar with dual conical outflows from @xcite , who observe a ring of star formation 2.3 kpc from the center of the galaxy .",
    "this result matches the rings and ovals of star formation as shown in figures [ fig : star_time_mass ] and [ fig : time_disk_r ] , which begin at a radius around 2 kpc and then extend outward with time .",
    "they also observe two clouds at a radius of 1.2 kpc that are forming stars and contend that the compression from the wind has triggered the star formation .",
    "@xcite sees similar phenomenon but with gmcs being compressed and pushed outward by agn while forming stars .",
    "we see the same effect in figure [ fig : star_time_mass ] , particularly the locations of star formation in wind - i90 , which leaves a trail of star formation as clouds are accelerated radially from the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "we see simultaneous positive and negative feedback in all of our simulations as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the negative feedback occurs in the center of the galaxy very quickly , within a radius of 2 - 3 kpc and within @xmath403 myr after the feedback is initialized as shown in figure [ fig : time_disk_r ] .",
    "however , the same figure shows positive feedback at radii greater than 3 kpc after 1 myr .",
    "the asymmetry of the locations of star forming regions as shown in figure [ fig : star_time_mass ] also agrees well with the idea of simultaneous positive and negative feedback as described in @xcite .",
    "they observe two quasars with fast , ionized winds and see negative feedback within the outflow itself but see positive feedback with star formation along the edges of the outflow .",
    "we see a similar result in our simulations , particularly in wind - i45 and wind - i90 .",
    "figure [ fig : star_time_mass ] shows that far fewer stars are formed within the region of the outflow , to a greater extent as the wind is pointed more directly into the disk in wind - i90 .",
    "however , stars are forming around the edges of the outflow .",
    "this phenomenon is highlighted by the quenched central regions without star formation , which have different shapes as a result of the different wind inclinations .",
    "however , our results seem to conflict with observational indications that jets are more likely to cause positive feedback than radio quiet quasars @xcite .",
    "@xcite even compares radio - loud and radio quiet galaxies with similar luminosities and find that the galaxies with jets have higher sfr s .",
    "they attribute negative feedback to photo - dissociation and positive feedback to the insertion of mechanical energy .",
    "however , all four of our simulations show positive feedback , with remarkably similar sfrs in three as seen in figure [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the differences in star formation may exist on smaller scales , where the differing ram pressures of the bubbles will have a strong impact on whether clouds of gas will collapse or be ablated .",
    "@xcite simulates winds of varied ram pressures striking a bonnor - ebert sphere of 72 @xmath16 and finds an anti - correlation between star formation and wind ram pressure , leading up to a threshold ram pressure above which the wind ablates the cloud before star formation can occur .",
    "though that threshold ram pressure is above the analytic theoretical expectations shown in figure [ fig : rad_vel_ramp ] , we do observe that the ram pressures in bubbles generated by agn winds are typically an order of magnitude greater than those generated by jets .",
    "that threshold ram pressure of 2e10 dynes @xmath56 is below the maximum ram pressures observed at the shocks of the bubbles of the jets and winds and above many of the locations inside the bubbles generated from winds .",
    "these ram pressures would indicate that star formation will be more likely in the cocoons from jets than those from winds despite that sfrs in the simulations in this study are similar .",
    "we find an inside out pattern of star formation in gas clouds with large radial velocities in all four simulations .",
    "these results are consistent with those from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite evolved the stellar orbits for 1 gyr after positive feedback from jet simulations and find more random and less coherent stellar velocities with large positive radial and vertical velocities that effectively enlarge the galaxy .",
    "it is reasonable to expect similar patterns of stellar distributions and velocities after a gyr in the agn wind simulations performed in this study .",
    "we investigate the differences in mechanical feedback from radio - loud ( jet ) and radio - quiet ( wind ) agn with four hydrodynamic simulations of a single , massive , gas - rich disk galaxy at a redshift of 23 ; one in which the galaxy hosts a jet at an inclination of @xmath89 with respect to the galactic plane normal , and three of wide angle , radio - quiet winds with inclinations of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "we analyze the impact of agn feedback on the host s gas , star formation , and circum - galactic medium .",
    "jet feedback is energy - driven , while wind feedback is momentum - driven .",
    "both jets and winds create a pronounced cavity with only little dense gas left in the galactic center where star formation ceases ; but we see agn - triggered star formation at radii greater than @xmath92 disk heights or 3 kpc in all the simulations , indicating simultaneous positive and negative feedback in the galaxy at different locations .",
    "cocoons from jets and winds accelerate clouds of gas where stars are forming , giving these stars larger radial and vertical velocities that may be observable as blue asymmetries in stellar velocity dispersions at different locations .",
    "the jet and winds trigger similar sfrs , but the wind at an inclination of 90@xmath0 continuously compresses the host s gas , generating high densities the most , thus causing the highest rates of star formation .",
    "more asymmetry in gas distribution and star formation location is created with larger wind inclination .",
    "our model generates an expanding ring of triggered star formation with typical velocity of order 1/3 of the circular velocity , superimposed on the older stellar population .",
