    "sandpile models form the paradigmatic examples of the concept of self organised criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "this is the phenomenon in which a slowly driven systems with many degrees of freedom evolves spontaneously into a critical state , characterised by long range correlations in space and time .    in the past decade",
    "much progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of sandpile models .",
    "this is especially true for the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) model @xcite , where , following the original work of dhar @xcite , a mathematical formalism was developped [ 48 ] that allows an exact calculation of several properties of the model such as height probabilities @xcite , the upper critical dimension @xcite and so on .",
    "despite all this work , it has however not been possible yet to give a full and exact characterisation of the scaling properties of the avalanches in the btw - model . in recent years",
    "it has become increasingly clear that , especially in two dimensions , avalanches are to be described by a full multifractal set of scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "this spectrum of exponents has been calculated with high numerical precision , but at this moment there is no clue how it can be determined by an analytical approach .",
    "avalanches can be decomposed into simpler objects called waves @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of waves seems to obey simple scaling @xcite and the exponent describing that scaling is known exactly , both for the general wave @xcite and for the last wave of each avalanche@xcite . since in dimensions @xmath0 , multiple topplings are extremely rare , it is to be expected that in these situations , wave and avalanche statistics obey the same scaling properties .",
    "more recently , the distribution of two consecutive waves has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the conditional probability that the @xmath1-th wave has size @xmath2 given that the previous wave had size @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is the first quantity to study when one is interested in correlation effects in waves .",
    "it are these correlations that make waves and avalanches different .",
    "paczuski and boettcher @xcite proposed , on the basis of extensive simulations , that @xmath4 has a scaling form @xmath5 where for large @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "numerical estimates for these exponents in @xmath10 are @xmath11 , @xmath12 . at this moment , no exact values for these exponents are known . in a very recent work , hu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite study the ` backward ' conditional probability @xmath13 and find that it obeys a similar scaling law @xmath14 where for large @xmath6 , @xmath15 , while @xmath16 for @xmath9 .",
    "these authors give arguments that show that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scaling exponent describing the size distribution of the last wave . the relation ( [ 3 ] ) is consistent with the numerical data for the square lattice where both euclidean and fractal dimensions of waves are @xmath19 .",
    "at the same time , it is desirable to get an independent verification of ( [ 3 ] ) using lattices of different dimensions .    in the present paper",
    "we study the properties of waves on the sierpinski gasket , continuing previous work @xcite . using the methods of analysis introduced in @xcite",
    ", we obtain precise numerical estimates for the exponents @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "also in this case equation ( [ 3 ] ) seems to be well satisfied which indicates that short time correlations in waves admit an analytical treatment .",
    "the btw sandpile model can be defined on any graph , but for definiteness we will introduce it in the context of the sierpinski gasket ( see figure 1 ) . each vertex ( apart from the three boundary sites ) of this graph has four nearest neighbours . to each such vertex @xmath22",
    "we associate a height variable @xmath23 which can take on any positive integer number .",
    "we also introduce a critical height @xmath24 , which we will take equal to four for all vertices . the number of sites in the lattice , @xmath25 , is trivially related to the number of iterations @xmath26 used in constructing the fractal .",
    "the dynamics is defined as follows . on a very slow time",
    "scale we drop sand at a randomly selected site and thereby increase the height variable by one : @xmath27 .",
    "when at a given site , @xmath28 , that site becomes _ unstable _ and _ topples _",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 through toppling , neighbouring sites can become unstable , topple themselves , create new unstable sites , and so on .",
    "avalanche _ of topplings proceeds on a very fast time scale and no new grains of sand are added before the avalanche is over .",
    "sand can leave the system when a boundary site topples .",
    "an avalanche is over when all sites are stable again .    for further reference",
    "it is also necessary to introduce the matrix @xmath31 , called the lattice green function , which is the inverse of @xmath32 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the order in which unstable sites are toppled does not influence the stable configuration which is obtained when the avalanche is over .",
    "this abelian nature of the sandpile model allows the introduction of the concept of _ waves _",
    "@xcite which are introduced in the following way .",
    "suppose that an avalanche starts at a site @xmath33 and that after a few topplings @xmath33 becomes unstable again .",
    "one can then forbid @xmath33 to topple again and continue with the toppling of other unstable sites untill all of them are stable .",
    "it is easy to show that in such a sequence all sites topple at most once .",
    "this set of topplings is called _ the first wave_. next , we topple the site @xmath33 for the second time .",
    "if after some topplings it becomes unstable again , we keep it fixed , and topple all the other unstable sites .",
    "this set of topplings constitutes the second wave .",
    "we continue in this way untill we finally reach a stable configuration .",
    "we can in this way decompose any avalanche in a set of waves .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath34 that an arbitrary wave involves @xmath35 topplings obeys simple scaling @xcite @xmath36 ( for the moment we neglect finite size effects which will be taken into account in section 4 . )",
    "because in a wave , sites topple at most once , waves are simpler objects to analyse than avalanches . without going into details",
    "we summarize the following important properties of waves @xcite    * there is a one - to - one correspondance between waves and the two - rooted spanning trees on a graph which consists of the sierpinski gasket and one extra site called the sink .",
    "the sink is connected with two edges to each of the three boundary sites of the sierpinski gasket . *",
    "the element @xmath37 of the green function is given by the ratio of the number of two - rooted spanning trees ( in which @xmath22 and @xmath38 are in the same subtree ) to the number of one - rooted spanning trees .",
    "moreover @xmath37 is also equal to the expected number of topplings at site @xmath38 when a grain of sand was dropped at site @xmath22 , which is proportional to the probability that a wave started at @xmath22 reaches @xmath38 .    from these results",
    ", it follows that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the linear size of the wave .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the green function on an arbitrary lattice is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fractal dimension of the lattice , and @xmath43 the dimension of a random walk on the lattice .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 . from the definition of fractal dimension , @xmath45",
    "we finally obtain @xmath46 so that @xmath47 a result first derived in @xcite . for the particular case of the sierpinski gasket , @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 , a result which is nicely consisted with the available numerical data .",
    "the properties of the last wave in a given avalanche are of special interest for us ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath50 that the last wave has @xmath51 topplings obeys the scaling law @xcite @xmath52 from the definition of waves it follows that the last wave has the property that the site @xmath33 is on the boundary of the wave .",
    "let us denote by @xmath53 the fractal dimension of the boundary of an arbitrary wave .",
    "the number of points on the boundary of a wave of size @xmath35 is then of order @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the probability that a given site is on the boundary of a wave of size @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath55 , which should also be proportional to @xmath56 . using ( 6 ) we immediately obtain @xmath57 in two dimensions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fractal dimension of the chemical path on a spanning tree .",
    "one thus finds @xmath61 @xcite . on a fractal",
    "the relation between @xmath53 and @xmath60 may be more complicated .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that for a deterministic fractal @xmath62 so that , from ( [ 9 ] ) we obtain @xmath63 the exponent @xmath60 on the sierpinski gasket was also calculated in @xcite with the result @xmath64}/\\log{2}$ ]",
    ". thus one finally obtains for the case of the sierpinski gasket @xmath65}}{\\log{3 } } \\approx 1.247 \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in section 4 , we will present numerical estimates for @xmath18 that are fully consistent with this prediction . in @xcite used implicitly that the graph is selfdual , which is correct for the square lattice but not for the sierpinski gasket .",
    "this error was pointed out by one of us ( vbp ) .",
    "the correct result is that given in ( [ 11 ] ) . ]",
    "in order to characterise the statistical properties of waves more completely , it is necessary to go beyond the description on the basis of the distribution @xmath34 only . following the work of paczuski and boettcher @xcite we now turn to a study of the conditional probability @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the size of the @xmath66-th wave .",
    "if the size of consecutive waves is a markov process , this conditional probability is sufficient to describe the evolution of wave sizes . in figure 2.a",
    ", we show our data for this conditional probability for sierpinski gaskets with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "all our data were obtained by studying at least @xmath69 avalanches .",
    "the figure shows the best fit of our data to the scaling form ( [ 1 ] ) proposed by paczuski and boettcher .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to obtain very accurate estimates for the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 in this way .",
    "we will come back to this issue in the next section .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the ` backward ' conditional probability @xmath13 is also of interest because it is possible to relate the exponents @xmath72 and @xmath21 ( see ( [ 2 ] ) ) to @xmath18 . in figure 2.b",
    "we present our data for this quantity , again for the case @xmath67 .",
    "we now repeat briefly the argument given in @xcite .",
    "we begin by rewriting ( [ 2 ] ) in a normalised form @xmath73    let s next consider the situation in which @xmath74 so that the argument of @xmath75 in ( [ 12 ] ) is large .",
    "in that case it must be so that the @xmath76-th wave has a non - empty intersection with the boundary of the previous wave ( see figure 3.a ) .",
    "indeed , assume the opposite so that the @xmath76-th wave covers a small region inside the much bigger @xmath66-th wave ( figure 3.b ) .",
    "but such a situation is forbidden , since all sites inside the @xmath66-th wave return to their original height after the wave has passed .",
    "the @xmath76-th wave must therefore follow the motion of the previous wave untill it hits the boundary of the @xmath66-th wave from where it can follow a different evolution .",
    "therefore , the situation of figure 3.b can not occur .",
    "then , consider figure 3.a on a coarse grained scale by performing a rescaling of the order of @xmath77 , the linear size of the @xmath1-th wave . on that scale ,",
    "the geometry of figure 3.a resembles that of last waves with @xmath2 playing the role of the origin of the avalanche , and @xmath3 that of the last wave .",
    "hence we arrive at the conclusion that in the limit @xmath78 , the distribution of @xmath3 coincides with that of the last wave . from (",
    "[ 12 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) and the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath75 , the equality ( [ 3 ] ) then follows .",
    "once this result has been obtained it is possible to obtain also a relation for the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 that appear in the scaling form ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the joint distribution @xmath79 can be written in two ways using either the forward or backward conditional probability @xmath80 we then insert ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) and a properly normalised version of ( [ 1 ] ) and get @xmath81 in the case @xmath74 we insert the proper limiting behaviours of the functions @xmath82 and @xmath75 , and immediately obtain , using ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath83    a final equality between exponents can be obtained by investigating the limit @xmath84 in ( [ extra ] ) .",
    "inserting the appropriate scaling behaviours one obtains @xmath85    in @xmath10 , ( [ 14 ] ) leads to the predictions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 is not too far from the numerical estimate @xmath11 reported by @xcite , while in @xcite numerical evidence is presented that is in agreement with the prediction ( [ 3 ] ) . in the following section ,",
    "we investigate the situation on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "in order to analyse our data we have used the method introduced in @xcite , in which one investigates the moments @xmath88 of the distribution @xmath89 , where we now explicitly take into account the size @xmath90 of the system . in our case ,",
    "if @xmath89 has a simple scaling form @xmath92 these moments should be proportional to simple powers of @xmath90 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 for @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .    in principle ,",
    "an analysis of the moments is most instructive when one is interested in the presence of possible multifractal scaling ( instead of simple scaling ) . in that case",
    ", the function @xmath98 becomes nonlinear .",
    "however , even in the absence of multifractality , this kind of analysis has many advantages . in the case of sierpinski gasket ,",
    "the probability distributions for the size of avalanches , waves and last waves show strong oscillations superposed on the pure power laws ( see the figures 2,4 and 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the discrete scale invariance of the system .",
    "these oscillations make the determination of the scaling exponents a hard task . the moments @xmath99 have the big advantage that they are averages over the distribution and hence the effects of the oscillations almost completely disappear .",
    "if one then assumes simple scaling , as we know is correct for waves @xcite , one can further reduce any remaining fluctuations by fitting the values of @xmath98 ( for @xmath100 big enough ) to a straight line .",
    "the slope of the line should equal @xmath42 , and the intersection with the @xmath100-axis gives @xmath101 .",
    "we tested this method of analysis for the last wave .",
    "we performed extensive simulations for sierpinski gaskets with @xmath102 .",
    "from the statistics of the last waves we could then estimate @xmath103 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the curvature at low @xmath100 is a finite size effect . from a fit of our data in the regime @xmath104",
    "we obtain the estimate @xmath105 .",
    "this is very close to the exact result which we obtained in section 2 .",
    "is also much lower then that obtained in @xcite from a direct fit to ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we are currently performing a multifractal analysis of data for the size and the area of avalanches in the btw ( and in a stochastic sandpile ) model , on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "the results will be published elsewhere . ]",
    "we have followed a similar scheme of analysis for all the other exponents introduced in section 3 .",
    "take as a concrete example the sum of exponents @xmath106 .",
    "this can be obtained as follows . for @xmath74 , @xmath107 . instead of analysing this distribution itself",
    "we look at the moments of @xmath108 which are expected to scale as @xmath109 .",
    "a plot of @xmath110 is shown in figure 5 . from an analysis of the data in this figure",
    "we obtain the estimate @xmath111 , which is very clearly consistent with the prediction ( [ 3 ] ) .    by analysing the small @xmath3 behaviour of @xmath13 in a similar way",
    ", we can estimate @xmath112 .",
    "continuing in this way for the forward conditional probability @xmath4 , we find from the large @xmath2-behaviour @xmath113 , while from the data for small @xmath2 we finally obtain @xmath114 ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "this numerical result is not too different from the prediction following from ( [ 14 ] ) which gives @xmath115 .",
    "finally note that also the relation ( [ extra.1 ] ) is rather well satisfied .",
    "in this paper we investigated the properties of waves in the sandpile model on a sierpinski gasket .",
    "we gave predictions for the exponent describing the last wave in an avalanche and for the scaling exponents occuring in forward and backward conditional probabilities for consecutive waves .",
    "these predictions were tested by extensive simulations and were found to be in good agreement with the numerics .",
    "we are currently investigating the presence of multifractality of avalanches on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "if , as is the case in @xmath116 ( @xcite ) and in @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , such multifractality shows up , the interesting question arises how such a phenomenon can be built up on the avalanche level when it is absent at the level of waves and consecutive waves .",
