    "the ever increasing accuracy of current and future fundamental physics experiments on ground and in space demands very stable and controlled environments to meliorate spurious effects such as temperature fluctuations . in this paper , we present a method that allows the rapid assessment of the performance of passive thermal shields in the frequency domain .",
    "this is done with analytical models instead of time consuming and precision limited numerical simulations .",
    "the frequency domain is of special interest since stability requirements are typically given in such domain .",
    "one of the key applications of this method is the design of thermal isolations for optical resonators ( ors ) , which are used as frequency references in highly sensitive interferometers , in experiments testing fundamental physics , and as optical frequency standards , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "ors consist of a spacer and two high - reflectivity mirrors .",
    "the distance between the mirrors defines the resonance frequency , which is directly linked to the length of the spacer .",
    "consequently , temperature fluctuations result in frequency fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the optical frequency , @xmath5 is the spacer length , @xmath6 is the spacer coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) and @xmath7 is its temperature .",
    "fluctuations of the variables are expressed as @xmath8 .",
    "the spacers of ors are made of materials with very low ctes , e.g.   ultra low expansion glass ( ule ) or zerodur with ctes about @xmath9k@xmath10 at room temperature   @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ors are often driven at temperatures close to their cte zero crossing ( or at the cte minimum )  @xcite . in case",
    "these temperatures can not be achieved , different techniques have been developed to tune the temperature of the zero crossing  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the accuracy of current optical experiments is already so high that these low ctes do not suffice and temperature fluctuations need to be strongly attenuated .",
    "the damping of temperature fluctuations at frequencies in the milli - hertz and sub - milli - hertz regime by several orders of magnitude demands a particularly careful thermal shield design .",
    "this low frequency range is crucial in different missions and experiments since the expected science signals are in the same frequency band .",
    "this is especially important for the space - based gravitational wave detector elisa  @xcite and foreseen missions testing the fundamental principles of general relativity such as the lorentz invariance with michelson - morley experiments and a kennedy - thorndike experiment like star ( spacetime asymmetry research  @xcite ) , mini - star , and boost ( boost symmetry test  @xcite ) , for earlier kennedy - thorndike experiments see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the thermal shield design is driven by the required temperature stability of the or , i.e. , the required frequency stability for a given spacer cte , and the temperature variations at the outer most thermal shield layer .",
    "for elisa the required temperature stability ( if a cavity is used for the laser pre - stabilization ) is  @xmath11khz@xmath12 in the mili - hertz band .",
    "the thermal environment in elisa will be extremely stable  @xcite and the required attenuation will not be very demanding . however , the main problem is for laboratory - based demonstration experiments  @xcite where @xmath11khz@xmath12 temperature stability in the sub - milli - hertz range is needed .",
    "for the kennedy thorndike experiments the allowed temperature fluctuations are typically @xmath130.1@xmath11k at the orbital period ( @xmath1490minutes ) and the expected stability in the satellites around 1k and @xmath1410mk can be achieved in the payload by active temperature control .",
    "this poses a stringent requirement on the thermal shields : about five orders of magnitude attenuation at @xmath140.2mhz .",
    "for the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow - on ( grace - fo ) interferometer similar figures are required  @xcite .",
    "the thermal shield performance is usually estimated with the help of tedious numerical simulations  @xcite or with rather simplified analytical models . however , a method to estimate its transfer function yielding results close to the numerical simulations is to our best knowledge still lacking . in this paper , we provide such a tool , using thermal shields for optical resonators as an example .",
