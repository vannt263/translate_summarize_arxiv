    "indeed it is easy to show ( see proposition [ p1.3 ] below ) that the maximal ideal space of our algebras ( for @xmath95 ) is the closed unit disk .",
    "then the well known equivalence of the density of @xmath36 in the maximal ideal space and the solvability of the bezout equation under the assumption ( with @xmath96 in our case ) gives the corona theorem for our algebras .",
    "this proposition is definitely not new .",
    "it follows , for example from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) .",
    "this theorem says , in particular , that for any algebra of functions @xmath34 satisfying the property @xmath99 its maximal ideal space coincides with the maximal ideal space of the @xmath100-closure of @xmath34 .",

    "that of course would imply that the spectrum of these algebras is completely @xmath33-visible for all @xmath90 .",
    "the estimates for the algebra @xmath82 will be obtained from the estimates for @xmath81 by a simple approximation argument .",
    "the same argument will be used to get the estimates for @xmath83 , with the essential difference that the construction of the approximating functions is quite involved in this case : the reasoning `` modulo the approximation '' is very similar to the one for the @xmath82 .",
    "note that the results for @xmath126 are quite known . while we can not give the exact reference , the fact that the estimates in the corona theorem for the disc algebra are the same as the estimates for @xmath32 is known to the specialists .",
    "the estimates in the corona theorem for the algebra @xmath116 were considered by the first author , @xcite , although the equality of these estimates to ones for @xmath32 was not mentioned there .",
    "we should also mention that the corona theorem for various algebras of smooth functions was studied by v.  tolokonnikov , @xcite .",
    "in particular , the corona theorem ( without estimates ) for the algebras considered in our paper follows from his results , see the remark immediately after proposition [ p1.3 ] above .",
    "for some algebras of smooth functions he also obtained the corona theorem with estimates .    however , the estimates in the corona theorem for the algebras we are considering do not follow from his results . such estimates , which are the main goal of the present paper , are completely new . also new is the fact that the estimates in all of the algebras we are considering are the same ( for the same @xmath0 ) , i.e.  that they do not depend on continuity properties of the last derivative .
