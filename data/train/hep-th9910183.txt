    ". it would be gratifying if one could exploit the direct calculation of the short distance potential from string theory given in this paper to explore nonperturbative physics associated with the qcd vacuum at short distances , a subject rich in conjecture and in open questions @xcite .",
    "this deserves further study .",
    "we conclude by noting that the characteristic d0brane velocity in the supersymmetric theory is of order @xmath34@xmath18@xmath337 @xcite , which implies a minimum distance @xmath4@xmath18@xmath338 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at large @xmath27 , the shortest distances that can be probed in the small velocity short distance approximation are pushed down to @xmath4@xmath2@xmath339 @xcite , where @xmath340@xmath2@xmath341 . in the introduction , we emphasized the importance of taking a large @xmath27 limit in order to keep gravitational corrections to amplitudes in the open string sector suppressed at _ long _ distances ; this was also an essential observation underlying maldacena s conjecture @xcite .",
    "we see now that taking the large n limit extends the regime of weakly coupled open and closed string theory _ both _ in the directions of longer _ and _ of shorter distance scales .",
