    "ever since the first measurements of their velocity dispersion became available ( aaronson 1983 , aaronson & olszewski 1987 ) , dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the milky way have been a difficult puzzle to piece together in models of galaxy formation .",
    "their relatively large size , low luminosity , and sizable velocity dispersion suggest the presence of large amounts of dark matter ( armandroff , olszewski & pryor 1995 , see the review of mateo 1998 ; for more recent work consult kleyna et al .",
    "2005 , muoz et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the absence of clear correlations between inferred dark matter content and the structural properties of the luminous component have led to arguments about the true physical nature of these objects and to various proposals to explain their large mass - to - light ratios .",
    "velocity dispersions unduly affected by binary stars ( olszewski et al 1996 ) ; line - of - sight alignment of unbound stars ( kroupa 1997 ) , and remnants of stellar clusters severely disrupted by tides ( metz & kroupa 2007 ) have all been considered in the literature , but consensus now seems to have been reached .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs , for short ) are widely regarded as dark matter - dominated systems sampling the extreme low - mass end of the dark halo mass function .",
    "nevertheless , a number of issues regarding the dark matter content of these elusive systems , as well as the spatial extent of their dark halos , remain largely unresolved .",
    "these issues were brought into focus when cosmological n - body simulations revealed the presence of substantial substructure in galaxy - sized cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these simulations indicate that _ hundreds _ of self - bound cold dark matter halos massive enough ( in principle ) to harbor a dwarf galaxy are expected to populate the halo of the milky way , in sharp contrast with the mere _ tens _ of dwarf galaxies known to orbit the galaxy .",
    "this realization rekindled interest in explaining the detailed correspondence between dark halos and luminous galaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function , an issue that had long been highlighted as a challenge for hierarchical galaxy formation models ( white & rees 1978 , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "the leading scenario for reconciling the discrepancy between `` luminous '' and `` dark '' substructure in the milky way halo envisions dwarf galaxies as able to form only in halos above a certain mass threshold .",
    "the threshold is determined by the need to retain gas and to sustain continuing star formation despite the effects of feedback from evolving stars and the heating from photoionizing radiation ( efstathiou 1992 , bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 , somerville 2002 , benson et al .",
    "2002 ) . adjusting the mass threshold appropriately ,",
    "the scarcity of luminous dwarfs may be explained by the relatively few massive substructure halos that exceed the threshold ( stoehr et al 2002 , hayashi et al 2003 , kazantzidis et al 2004 ) .",
    "this is an appealing and elegant solution , and offers a relatively clean prediction that may be tested observationally : most dwarfs at the extreme faint end of the luminosity function should inhabit relatively massive halos , of mass comparable to that defined by the threshold .",
    "for example , given the large spread in luminosity of dwarfs in the local group but recent discoveries based on the sdss have uncovered the presence of many fainter dwarfs , extending the galaxy luminosity function to as faint as a few thousand @xmath4 ( e.g. irwin et al . 2007 and references therein ) ] , and the expectation that they should all inhabit halos of similar mass , this proposal implies that there should be little correlation between the dark matter and luminous content of a dwarf .",
    "massive dark halos would also be more affected by dynamical friction ( pearrubia et al . 2002 , zentner & bullock 2003 , pearrubia & benson 2005 , pearrubia et al .",
    "2006 ) , leading to a bias in the spatial distribution of dsphs within the halo of the milky way relative to the bulk of substructure halos  an effect that may be potentially observable .",
    "finally , their relatively massive halos would make these extremely faint galaxies more resilient to tidal disruption , suggesting that tidal tails and other obvious evidence of tidal stirring should be present only in systems that have lost most of their original mass by the action of tidal forces .",
    "in these models , the `` tidal '' radii attached by king - model fitting to the surface brightness profiles of dsphs , as well as the `` break '' radii identified in the outskirts of some dsphs , should reflect just the edge of the luminous component rather than a feature of dynamical significance ( e.g. umi , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 , palma et al . 2003 ; carina , majewski et al . 2005 ) . establishing the present dark matter content of dwarf galaxies in the local group",
    "thus promises to be a fruitful enterprise .",
    "validating ( or refuting ) these theoretical expectations through observation is , however , not straightforward .",
    "one reason is that few dwarfs have gas on circular orbits and , therefore , stars are the only viable dynamical tracer .",
    "the interpretation of the observations is thus complicated by degeneracies between orbital shapes , their radial dependence , and the overall mass profile ( wilkinson et al .",
    "2002 , kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 , mashchenko et al .",
    "2006 , kleyna et 2004 , tolstoy et al .",
    "2004 , wilkinson et al .",
    "2004 , muoz et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , wang et al .",
    "2005 , walker et al . 2006a , b , sohn et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the second reason concerns the fact that these dynamical tracers lie , by definition , within the luminous radius of the dwarfs .",
    "since dark halos are expected to be extended objects reaching far beyond the luminous confines of a galaxy , a certain amount of uncertain extrapolation appears inevitable . in this respect ,",
    "mass - follows - light models ( richstone & tremaine 1986 ) only provide an approximate estimate of the amount of dark matter within the luminous radius that can not be safely extrapolated to larger distances .",
    "finally , galactic tides may affect dark matter and stars differently , especially if stars are , as expected , strongly segregated relative to the dark halo .",
    "thus a dwarf may today inhabit a relatively low - mass halo ( say , below the threshold mentioned above ) even though it actually formed in a massive one that has since seen much of its mass stripped away by tides ( kravtsov , gnedin & klypin 2004 ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that attempt to address these issues by interpreting available observational data on local group dwarfs in the cosmological context defined by the leading paradigm of structure formation ; the cold dark matter theory .",
    "we start by considering the constraints on cdm halos placed by the structural and dynamical properties of the dwarfs , and use these results to try and interpret the origin of structural differences in the population of dwarfs that orbit m31 and the milky way , respectively",
    ". a future paper on the subject will analyze in detail the effects of galactic tides , both in the survival of the stellar components , as well as on the observational signatures imprinted by stripping ( pearrubia , navarro & mcconnachie in prep . ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the relevant observations and the modeling procedure , whereas  3 applies the models to the milky way dwarfs .",
    "we apply these results to m31 dwarfs in  4 , and conclude with a brief summary in  5 .",

    "similarly , the velocity dispersion for and ii ( ct et al .",
    "1999 ) is based on just seven stars and is thus subject to sizable uncertainty . the @xmath5 estimate for cetus ( lewis et al 2006 ) is based on a larger sample of stars and it is thus more reliable .",
    "we present these data in table  [ tab : obs ] between parenthesis in order to emphasize that these data are not of the same quality as is available for the mw dsphs .",
    "we return to this issue in  4 .",
    "the past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of dwarf satellites discovered around m31 and the mw , in particular as a result of the completion of the sloan digital sky survey ( zucker et al .",

    "2006 , irwin et al .",
    "many of these systems are morphologically not unlike the ones listed in table  [ tab : obs ] , but they are typically much fainter and of much lower surface brightness , which has precluded robust fits to their surface brightness profiles .",
    "the sample of milky way dwarf galaxies used here only includes ( i ) dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( i.e. , non - rotating systems with little or no detectable gas ) .",
    "these galaxies must have : ( i ) king profile fit parameters available from the literature and ( ii ) measured central velocity dispersion .",
    "thus our sample excludes many of the recently discovered dsph galaxies in the milky way and m31 .",
    "we have also excluded the canis major dsph ( martin et al .",
    "2004 ) because of its uncertain nature .",
    "a lively debate can be found in the literature , with arguments in favour of this system being a new galaxy ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2005 , bellazzini et al .",
    "2006 ) and against it ( e.g. momany et al .",
    "2006 , moitinho et al .",
    "sagittarius dsph was also removed from our sample because that is a clear case where tidal stripping has altered the luminous component as well as the dark matter halo .",
    "this particular system will be studied in detail in subsequent papers of this series , which address the effects of tides on the results presented here .",
    "our dwarf galaxies models assume the presence of two components in dynamical equilibrium : ( i ) a stellar component approximated by a king ( 1966 ) model , and ( ii ) a dark matter halo , which we approximate using an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the dark matter dominates the dynamics of the system , and that stars may be regarded as massless tracers of the potential .",

    "is determined by the _",
    "total _ gravitational potential , @xmath67 , theough jeans equations . in particular ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion of stars , @xmath68 , is given by @xmath69 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , where @xmath70 is the velocity anisotropy .",
    "we shall assume hereafter that the stellar velocity distribution is isotropic ( @xmath71 ) , which implies that the ( observable ) stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath0 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the projected radius and @xmath74 is the projected stellar density , @xmath75 we follow traditional convention and define the ( projected ) core radius , @xmath6 , by the condition @xmath76 .",
    "the core radius , defined this way , depends on both of the king model parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for example , @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "we assume that dark matter halos may be approximated by nfw profiles ( navarro et al 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the density profile may be written as @xmath79 } ,   \\label{eq : rhoh } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the mass within the virial radius , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the scale radius and @xmath83 is the concentration ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the virial radius is defined so that the mean overdensity relative to the critical density is @xmath85 , @xmath86 we follow bryan & norman ( 1998 ) and define the overdensity by @xmath87 where @xmath88    we assume throughout the paper a @xmath89cdm universe by fixing the cosmological parameters to @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , consistent with constraints from cmb measurements and galaxy clustering ( see spergel et al 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "finally , we note that an nfw profile is fully determined by two characteristic parameters , such as the virial mass and the concentration . however , because the virial definitions adopted above depend on redshift , it is sometimes preferable to characterize an nfw halo by the location of the circular velocity peak , ( @xmath95 , @xmath1 ) , where    @xmath96^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq : vmax}\\ ] ]    and @xmath97 .",
    "although the two characterizations are equivalent , we shall adopt the latter in this paper , since it is independent of redshift and its parameters are more easily compared with observation .",
    "stars that follow a king model and inhabit an nfw halo have their kinematics dictated principally by the spatial segregation of stars relative to dark matter , which may be quantified by the ratio of king `` core '' radius to nfw scale radius , @xmath98 . the more concentrated the stars are relative to the dark matter , the smaller the velocity of the stars will be relative to the characteristic circular velocity of the dark matter dominated potential .    fig .",
    "[ fig : dprof ] shows the projected density profile of king models as a function of @xmath98 , and compares them to an nfw profile .",
    "the radial units are scaled to the nfw scale radius , @xmath82 , and the vertical units are arbitrary in this plot .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sprof ] .",
    "velocities have been scaled to the peak circular velocity of the nfw halo , @xmath1 , and show clearly the anticipated behaviour : the deeper the stars are embedded within the halo , the smaller the stellar velocities . for example , if @xmath99 , the stellar central velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , is only about 40% of @xmath1 , but this value rises to 80% for @xmath100 .",
    "there is also a weak dependence on the tidal radius , but this is minor , as discussed below .",
    "this implies that a `` family '' of nfw halos is consistent with a king model of given @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( see strigari et al 2006 for a similar argument applied to the fornax dsph ) .",
    "the more embedded we assume the king model to be within the nfw halo , the more massive ( i.e. , higher @xmath1 ) the halo must be in order to explain a given @xmath5 .",
    "this `` king - nfw degeneracy '' is illustrated in figure  [ fig : s0rcrs ] , where the thick lines show the correspondence between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the three thick lines ( almost indistinguishable from one another in this panel ) correspond to three different values of the tidal - to - core radius ratio chosen for the king model , and confirm the result anticipated above regarding the weak dependence on @xmath7 of these results .    _",
    "any _ nfw halo whose circular velocity peaks somewhere along the thick curve in figure  [ fig : s0rcrs ] is , therefore , consistent with a king model of given @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a few examples of nfw halos belonging to this `` family '' are shown by the thin lines in figure  [ fig : s0rcrs ] .",
    "note that essentially all the circular velocity profiles of these halos , despite having very different masses and concentrations , cross each other at @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that the total enclosed mass within the core radius of a king model is robustly determined given our assumptions : in particular , we find @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "physically , this means that , although the _ total _ mass and radial extent of the halo are not well pinned down , the mass within the luminous region sampled by the tracers is .",
    "( see also strigari et al .",
    "2007 for a similar approach and conclusion . )",
    "a further constraint may be gleaned from fig .",
    "[ fig : sprof ] , which shows that the _ shape _ of the stellar velocity dispersion profile also depends on the degree of segregation between stars and dark matter . for @xmath106 ( @xmath107 )",
    "the velocity profile remains approximately flat well outside the core radius , and declines abruptly only at the `` tidal '' radius . on the other hand ,",
    "less segregated king models show a steep velocity decline noticeable near the core radius : for example , for @xmath108 the velocity dispersion declines by roughly @xmath109 at the core radius from the central value .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles of all dwarfs for which such data are available show little sign of declining outside @xmath6 ( see references in   [ ssec : obs ] ) .",
    "in the context of our modeling , this suggests that the stellar component is deeply embedded within its parent cdm halo ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) , an issue to which we return below .",
    "one way of breaking the degeneracy illustrated in figure  [ fig : s0rcrs ] is to appeal to the results of cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "these show that there is a strong correlation between the mass and concentration of a cdm halo or , equivalently , between @xmath95 and @xmath1 . as discussed by nfw",
    ", this correlation arises because the characteristic density of a halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time of its assembly . in practice , and for galaxy - sized systems , the mass - density dependence is quite weak , implying that @xmath95 is roughly proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this correlation is now well established , and a number of authors provide simple formulae to compute it once the cosmological parameters are specified ( nfw , eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 , bullock et al 2001 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath95 implies that , of all nfw halos in the `` family '' of models allowed for a given dwarf by the degeneracy illustrated in figure  [ fig : s0rcrs ] , a single one will be consistent with the parameters expected in a given cosmogony .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : vmrs_8 ] , where the curved lines show , in different panels and for each of the eight mw dsphs , the king - nfw `` degeneracy '' relation .",
    "the straight lines in each panel delineate the @xmath1-@xmath95 relation consistent with the @xmath89cdm cosmogony .",
    "the set of three straight lines correspond to nfw halos identified at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "we shall hereafter ignore the relatively small difference between these curves and refer , for simplicity , all of our results to @xmath111 .    in each panel a solid dot indicates , for reference , the core radius and the central velocity dispersion of each galaxy , as listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "all of these points lie well to the left of the cosmological relations , confirming our earlier suggestion that the luminous components are significantly segregated within their dark halos ( i.e. , they are substantially smaller for given characteristic velocity ) .",
    "the intersection between the king - nfw degeneracy and the cosmological relation is marked by red symbols for each dwarf .",
    "this indicates the parameters of the nfw halo model that is consistent with the @xmath89cdm cosmogony and , at the same time , matches the kinematics and structure of each dwarf galaxy .",
    "the circular velocity profiles of the eight nfw halos satisfying these criteria are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vc ] , and labelled from top to bottom in order of decreasing halo mass .",
    "this ranking shows interesting peculiarities .",
    "for example , it shows that the peak circular velocities of dwarf halos vary from @xmath114 to @xmath115 km / s , corresponding to a spread of about @xmath116 in mass , much narrower than the factor of @xmath117 spanned by dsph luminosities .",
    "note as well that , as anticipated in  1 , halo mass is not monotonically related to luminosity .",
    "intriguingly , draco , one of the faintest dwarfs in our sample , is assigned the most massive halo , whereas fornax , despite being 70 times brighter , is assigned a halo 5 times less massive .",
    "the lack of correlation between luminosity and halo mass is shown explicitly in figure  [ fig : mvir ] , where we plot , as a function of total visual magnitude , the virial mass of the halo ( red symbols at the top ) , as well as the mass within the core radius of each dwarf ( blue symbols at bottom ) .",
    "symbols are the same as those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : vc ] to denote different galaxies .",
    "note that the total mass within the core radius  a fairly robust measure according to our discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : s0rcrs]is approximately independent of luminosity .",
    "this implies that the _ average density _ of dark matter will be higher in physically smaller systems such as draco than in more extended dwarfs such as fornax .",
    "why does this matter ? because more massive halos are denser than less massive ones _ at all radii _ in the cdm cosmogony .",
    "indeed , note that the circular velocity profiles of the nfw halos shown in figure  [ fig : vc ] do not cross , which means that measuring the halo circular velocity ( or mass ) at _ any _ radius leads to a well - defined estimate of the _ total _ mass of the halo .",
    "because draco , despite being faint , has a circular velocity comparable to fornax s at a much smaller radius , it requires a denser , and therefore more massive , halo to satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "of the eight dwarfs , the lowest halo mass corresponds to sextans , whose relatively large radius and small velocity dispersion is inconsistent with a very massive cdm halo .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section assume that the structure of dark matter halos is well approximated by an nfw profile .",
    "although this assumption may be appropriate for isolated halos , it is unlikely to hold in detail for `` substructure '' halos of dsphs orbiting within the main halo of the milky way .",
    "recently , stoehr et al ( 2002 ) , hayashi et al ( 2003 ) and kazantzidis et al ( 2004 ) have examined the modifications undergone by an nfw halo as it is tidally stripped inside a more massive system .",
    "stripping affects principally the outer regions of the halo , and therefore deeply embedded stellar structures may survive unscathed the removal of large fractions of their halos .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : strip ] , which shows the circular velocity profile of an nfw halo , after being tidally stripped of 50% , 75% , and 90% of its mass , respectively .",
    "the profiles are taken from n - body simulations of nfw halos orbiting within the potential of a much larger system , as in hayashi et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : strip ] indicates that nfw halos must lose at least 90% of their original mass before regions within @xmath118 are significantly affected .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the region that our analysis suggests is populated by the stars of mw dwarfs . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : vc ] the average @xmath119 for all mw dwarfs is @xmath120 and they all have , with the possible exception of sextans , @xmath121 .",
    "tidal stripping is clearly affecting the structure of the sagittarius dsph ( which is thus not in the sample considered here ) , but the evidence is less clear - cut in the case of other dwarfs , despite a rich literature on the topic . much of this work is based on detecting stars associated with a dwarf beyond the king `` tidal radius '' , or on the interpretation of `` breaks '' in the surface density profile in the outer regions of a dwarf ( e.g. ursa minor , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 , carina , majewski et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the presence of a break in the outer profile , however , does _ not _ imply that the system is necessarily losing stars .",
    "such feature might just be intrinsic to the dsph , as shown , for example , by the multiple - component models presented in mcconnachie et al .",
    "these authors show that systems with multiple stellar components ( such as andromeda ii ) may have overall density profiles that resemble those of dwarf galaxies with outer `` tidal '' breaks .",
    "the presence of well - defined and kinematically - distinct populations of stars within some dsphs ( sculptor , tolstoy et al . 2004 ; fornax , battaglia et al . 2006 ; canis venatici , ibata et al . 2006 ) , indeed , argues _ against _ tides as a major driver in the evolution of a dsph , since tidal stirring would tend to uniformize such distinctions .    on similar grounds , one can not rule out that other features in the light profile usually ascribed to tides , such as the presence of lumps ( umi , olszewski & aaronson 1985 ) , shells ( fornax , coleman et al . 2005 ) and aspherical isopleths ( umi , martnez - delgado 2001 ) may actually reflect complexities in the formation process and/or the internal evolution of dwarf galaxies .    the lack of overwhelming evidence for ongoing stripping of stars from most dsphs may thus be taken to imply that dwarf halos have retained at least 10% of their original mass at present .",
    "this is important , because even for such sizeable loss , the peak circular velocity of the halo is barely affected .",
    "the thin line in figure  [ fig : strip ] tracks the position of the circular velocity peak of an nfw halo as it is tidally stripped , and shows that halos that have lost 75% of their mass to stripping see only a 10% decrease in @xmath1 . even after losing 90% of its mass",
    ", a halo sees its @xmath1 reduced by only @xmath122 , on the other hand , is more significantly affected , and shifts inwards by almost a factor of @xmath123 after a halo loses 90% of its mass . ] .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that , unless dsphs have suffered catastrophic tidal losses , our estimates of the peak circular velocities for the mw dsphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vc ] ) should be relatively robust , even if the amount of dark matter beyond the luminous radius remains unknown .",
    "we emphasize , however , that tides do pose a number of interesting questions that our modeling fails to address .",
    "for example , do king profiles survive strong tidal stripping ? .",
    "do we expect the presence of `` extra - tidal '' stars beyond a _",
    "break radius _ if the luminous component is still surrounded by dark matter ?",
    "these issues are best addressed by self - consistent n - body simulation of the tidally - driven evolution of multi - component dsph models .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper , but will be dealt with in a forthcoming paper of our series .",
    "the analysis of the preceding subsections suggests that the 8 mw dwarfs chosen for our analysis inhabit halos with peak circular velocities in the range @xmath124-@xmath125 km / s , a factor of @xmath123 higher than their central ( stellar ) velocity dispersions .",
    "as discussed by stoehr et al ( 2002 ) , hayashi et al ( 2003 ) and kazantzidis et al ( 2004 ) , this correction is enough to alleviate substantially the `` satellite crisis '' highlighted by klypin et al ( 1999 ) and moore et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vccum ] , which compares the estimates of the peak circular velocities obtained in this contribution ( full circles ) with those that adopt mass - follows - light models ( full triangles ) .    in rough terms ,",
    "n - body simulations show that there are typically about @xmath126-@xmath127 substructure halos with peak circular velocities exceeding @xmath128 of the main halo s virial velocities .",
    "that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vccum ] from the results of diemand , kuhlen & madau ( 2006 ) for two different milky way - like halos ( dotted and dahsed lines ) . according to our analysis",
    ", there are about a dozen dwarfs with @xmath129 km / s ( adding to our sample brighter satellites such as the magellanic clouds ) .",
    "this velocity corresponds to between @xmath116 and @xmath130 of the mw virial velocity , assuming , as seems likely , that the latter is in the range @xmath131-@xmath132 km / s .",
    "this factor of @xmath3@xmath2 discrepancy between the number of massive dark matter substructures and luminous satellites does not appear extravagant given the uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy may disappear altogether if ( as the scenario outlined in   [ sec : int ] would suggest ) the ultra - faint mw dwarfs identified in sdss data ( open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : vccum ] ) turn out to inhabit halos of masses comparable to those of the 8 dsphs we consider here .",
    "since these newly discovered dwarfs have , on average , similar physical size to the dsphs in table 1 , we expect that their velocity dispersions will also be comparable and in the range @xmath133-@xmath134 km / s , a prediction of this cdm - motivated modeling that should be testable in the near future .",
    "indeed , further progress on this subject seems imminent , as observational campaigns secure velocity dispersions for many of the newly discovered dwarfs and extend available data to allow for velocity dispersion profiles to be measured for more systems ( see , e.g. , the recent preprint by simon & geha 2007 ) .",
    "one also expects that numerical simulations will improve to the point that a reliable direct estimate of the number of substructure halos satisfying the @xmath135 constraints shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvir ] will be possible , obviating the need to extrapolate results out to the peak of the halo circular velocity curve .",
    "the latter goal requires simulations able to resolve convincingly the inner @xmath136 pc of substructure halos , an order of magnitude improvement over simulations published so far .",
    "this is a numerical challenge that will likely be met soon but that will nevertheless require the investment of massive computational resources ( see the recent preprint by kuhlen et al 2007 for a report of recent progress on this issue . )",
    "photometric studies of the dwarf galaxies in the local group ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 , mcconnachie & irwin 2006 ) have shown that , at fixed luminosity , m31 dwarfs are considerably more extended than their milky way counterparts ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : mw_m31 ] , where king model fits to the surface brightness profiles of three pairs of dwarfs of similar luminosity are shown .",
    "each pair consists of one m31 satellite and one mw satellite , respectively . clearly , the m31 dwarfs are systematically different : they are about 1.5 mag fainter in central surface brightness and about a factor of two larger in radial extent compared with mw dwarfs ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : s0pred ] ) .",
    "the origin of this difference is unclear , but it offers nonetheless a way of assessing the general validity of the modeling proposed in the previous sections . indeed , under the plausible assumption that the dark matter halos of dwarfs in m31 and in the milky way are not systematically dissimilar , the arguments of   [ ssec : seg ] imply that the difference in size of m31 dwarfs should be reflected in their kinematics through significantly higher velocity dispersions . note that this prediction depends explicitly on the presence of dark matter halos whose mass and extent are largely independent from the stars , as implicitly assumed in our modeling so far .",
    "other ( also plausible ? ) assumptions , such as mass - traces - light , would lead to the _ opposite _ trend , and would predict systematically _ lower _ velocity dispersions .    in order to estimate quantitatively the velocity dispersion of m31 dwarfs we need to know how spatially segregated the stars are from the dark matter in these systems .",
    "once this is fixed by , for example , assuming a value for the ratio @xmath119 , we can compute @xmath95 for each dwarf and , from that , infer @xmath1 assuming the cosmological relation between these parameters . since the ratio @xmath119 also fixes @xmath101 according to the king - nfw degeneracy shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : s0rcrs ] , an estimate can then be made of the central velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , for each m31 dwarf .",
    "we have followed this procedure , assuming @xmath137 , consistent with the average segregation measure derived for mw dwarfs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strip ] ) , as well as with the flat @xmath0 constraint mentioned in ",
    "[ ssec : seg ] .",
    "this leads to the estimates of the velocity dispersions of m31 dwarfs plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s0pred ] ( open symbols ) .",
    "error bars show the variation induced in the estimate by allowing @xmath119 to vary between @xmath138 and @xmath139 . clearly , the velocity dispersion of m31 dsphs is significantly larger ( by about a factor of @xmath3 ) than that of their mw counterparts , as shown by the shift between solid circles and open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : s0pred ] .",
    "we emphasize that these `` predictions '' for the velocity dispersions of m31 dwarfs should be taken with caution : indeed , the open symbols in fig .  [ fig : s0pred ] are best interpreted as _ indicative _ of the relative shift in the velocity dispersion of the _ population _ of m31 dwarfs rather than as separate individual predictions .",
    "so far , the few available observations are consistent with the predicted trend .",
    "of the three dwarfs outside the mw for which velocity dispersions have been published ( see , table  [ tab : obs ] ) , the most reliable is cetus and , at @xmath124 km / s , has the highest @xmath140 in the sample , consistent with the predicted trend ( our naive prediction yields @xmath141 km / s ) .",
    "likewise , the higher of the two estimates derived by chapman et al ( 2005 , @xmath53 km / s ) for and ix is also consistent with this trend , although the very few stars in this galaxy ( as well as in and ii ) with measured velocities suggest that it would be premature to draw firm conclusions until the data improves substantially .",
    "it is clear , however , that should future observations fail to confirm the predicted trend , one or many of our assumptions would need to be revised . as an illustrative example , we consider how our interpretation would change if the velocity dispersion of m31 dwarfs were to show no systematic departure from that of their mw counterparts ( i.e. , if the open symbols were found to align with the dashed line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s0pred ] ) . in this case",
    ", one would be forced to conclude that m31 and mw dwarfs of similar luminosity inhabit systematically different halos . in particular",
    ", m31 dwarf halo hosts would need to be significantly less massive ( i.e. , lower @xmath1 and smaller @xmath95 ) in order to accommodate their larger physical size but similar kinematics .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsvmpred ] , and imply that essentially all m31 dwarfs considered here would have @xmath142 km / s ( with the possible exception of and vii ) . since , in all likelihood , m31 inhabits a halo at least as massive as the milky way s , it should have at least as many massive substructures as our own galaxy , and one would need to explain why those substructures have not `` lit up '' in m31 as they have in the milky way .",
    "we consider this a compelling argument against this interpretation and in support of higher velocity dispersions for m31 dwarfs as the most natural prediction of cdm - motivated models of the local group dsphs .",
    "one last possibility should be mentioned ; namely , that the structural differences between m31 and mw dwarfs reflect differences in the dynamical evolution driven by tides in m31 and the galaxy . although we have argued in  3.3 that this is unlikely , a definitive assessment requires high - resolution , self - consistent n - body simulations of how tides affect multiple - component models of dsph galaxies .",
    "we plan to address this issue in the follwoing paper of this series ( pearrubia , navarro & mcconnachie , in preparation ) .",
    "we have considered in this paper the observational constraints placed on the mass and spatial extent of cold dark matter halos surrounding local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies . assuming that the luminous component may be approximated by king models and that dark halos follow the nfw mass profile , we conclude that estimates of the halo mass of a dsph depend principally on the degree of spatial segregation between stars and dark matter :",
    "the more embedded the stars within the dark halo the more massive the halo must be in order to explain the observed stellar kinematics .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken by appealing to the results of cosmological n - body simulations  which indicate a strong correlation between mass and size of cold dark matter halos .",
    "the procedure results in reasonably robust estimates of the dark halo mass of a dsph and of its peak circular velocity .",
    "our analysis indicates that the mass within the luminous radius of the dwarf is well constrained by the velocity dispersion of the stars , and that it is approximately independent of the luminosity of the system . within the context of cosmologically motivated cdm halos",
    ", this implies that dsphs are surrounded by halos with peak circular velocities a factor of @xmath123 times larger than their stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "these results are consistent with previous work , and substantially alleviate the `` missing satellites '' problem , particularly if most of the newly discovered ultra - faint satellites are confirmed to be bona - fide dwarf galaxies akin to the more luminous , classical systems analyzed here .",
    "we also find that stars in dsphs are deeply embedded within their dark matter halos , with core radii typically of order 5% the radius where the original halo circular velocity peaks .",
    "this yields velocity dispersion profiles that are nearly flat out to the nominal king tidal radius , as observed for most of the milky way dsphs with suitable kinematical data .",
    "the deep segregation of the sellar component also implies that the stars of dwarf galaxies are fairly resilient to tidal disruption ; a halo would need to lose more than 90% of its mass before stars begin to be affected . even in this case",
    ", the peak circular velocity of a halo would only drop by @xmath143 , suggesting that our @xmath1 estimates are robust even if halos have been heavily ( but perhaps not catastrophically ) affected by tidal stripping .",
    "applied to the dsph population of m31 , this analysis suggests that the systematic difference in size between m31 dwarfs and their mw counterparts should be reflected in their kinematics . under the plausible assumption that substructure halos in m31 are similar to those of the milky way , we conclude that",
    ", as a population , the velocity dispersion of m31 dwarfs should be @xmath144100% higher than that of dwarfs in our own galaxy .",
    "this prediction is likely to be validated ( or challenged ) soon by the results of the many ongoing observational projects devoted to obtaining accurate spectra and radial velocities for stars in these galaxies .",
    "whether local group dwarfs conform with the expectations of the prevailing cdm paradigm or throw it a further gauntlet we should know in the near future .",

    "<S> we examine the dynamics of stellar systems embedded within cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos in order to assess observational constraints on the dark matter content of local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) . approximating the stellar and dark components by king and nfw models , respectively </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the parameters of dark halos consistent with the kinematics and spatial distribution of stars in dsphs as well as with cosmological n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows , in agreement with previous work , that the total mass within the luminous radius is reasonably well constrained and approximately independent of the luminosity of the dwarf , highlighting the poor correspondence between luminosity and halo mass at the extremely faint end of the luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that the average density of dark matter is substantially higher in physically small systems such as draco and sculptor than in larger systems such as fornax . because massive cdm halos are denser than low mass ones at all radii , these results imply that draco formed in a halo 5 times more massive than fornax s despite being roughly 70 times fainter . </S>",
    "<S> stellar velocity dispersion profiles ( @xmath0 ) provide further constraints ; in systems where data exist , @xmath0 remains flat almost to the nominal `` tidal '' radius , implying that stars are deeply embedded within their cold dark matter halos and are therefore quite resilient to tidal disruption . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that halos would need to lose more than 90% of their original mass before tides begin affecting the kinematics of stars , but even then the peak circular velocity of the dark halo , @xmath1 , would be barely affected . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath1 is about @xmath2 times higher than the central velocity dispersion of the stars , a result in agreement with previous estimates and that alleviates significantly the cdm `` substructure crisis '' . </S>",
    "<S> we use these results to interpret the structural differences between the m31 and milky way ( mw ) dsph population and , in particular , the observation that m31 dwarfs are physically more extended by approximately a factor two than mw dwarfs of similar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling indicates that the difference in size should be reflected in their kinematics , and predicts that m31 dwarfs should have velocity dispersions up to a factor of @xmath3 higher than their mw counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this is an eminently falsifiable prediction of cdm - motivated models of dsphs that may be verified with present observational capabilities . </S>"
