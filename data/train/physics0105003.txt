    "the bess spectrometer , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bess99 ] , was designed  @xcite and developed  @xcite as a high - resolution balloon - borne spectrometer with the capability to search for rare cosmic - rays and provide various precision measurements of cosmic - ray primaries . in spite of many advantages in cylindrical configuration",
    ", the adoption of solenoidal magnets could not be realized in previous balloon - borne spectrometers because of much unavoidable material in particle passage .",
    "however , a thin superconducting solenoid developed at kek @xcite enabled us to uniquely adopt this concentric configuration . a uniform magnetic field of 1 tesla is produced by a thin superconducting coil  @xcite , through which particles can pass without too many interactions .",
    "the magnetic - field region is filled with a tracking detectors ( jet / idcs ) , resulting in an acceptance of 0.3 m@xmath1sr .",
    "tracking is performed by fitting up to 28 hit points in the drift chambers .",
    "the upper and lower scintillator hodoscopes ( tof )  @xcite provide time - of - flight and two d@xmath2/d@xmath3 measurements .",
    "the instrument also incorporates a threshold - type cherenkov counter  @xcite with a silica - aerogel radiator to distinguish high - energy @xmath4 s from electron and muon backgrounds .",
    "event.,width=302 ]    since 1993 through 2000 , seven balloon flights have been successfully carried out and more than @xmath5 antiprotons ( @xmath4 s ) have been unambiguously detected @xcite .",
    "this has allowed measuring the energy spectrum of cosmic @xmath4 s and investigating their origin .",
    "to investigate the origin of low energy @xmath4 s more sensitively , it is inevitably important to reduce systematic errors as well as statistical errors of the resultant spectrum .",
    "the dominant source of systematic error in the low energy region ( @xmath6 1  gev ) is the uncertainty in @xmath4 interaction losses in the instrument . in the previous analyses , we surmised @xmath015  % relative error to the detection efficiency ( @xmath7 ) , which is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of incidence within the acceptance of the detector , and",
    "@xmath10 is the number of identified particles .",
    "since @xmath9 can not be derived directly from flight data , the detection efficiency is evaluated using the monte carlo simulation ( bess mc ) @xcite based on the geant / gheisha code @xcite .",
    "the bess mc incorporates detailed material and detector descriptions such that realistic detector performance is obtained .",
    "the original gheisha code was modified so that experimental data of @xmath4-nuclei cross sections are reproduced @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the systematic error due to interaction losses because of uncertainties in secondary multiplicity , angular distribution , and detector response ; accordingly , detection efficiency must be directly measured and must precisely verified to reduce systematic error in the low - energy region @xmath4 flux .    considering this , we performed an accelerator beam experiment at the kek - ps k2 beam line using a low - energy @xmath4 and proton ( @xmath11 ) beam .",
    "the objectives of the beam experiment were as follows :    1 .   directly measure detection efficiencies for @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s ; 2 .",
    "examine the bess mc simulation ; 3 .",
    "reduce systematic error in detection efficiency especially for @xmath4 s .    although the bess detector has been successively upgraded since the first successful flight in 1993 ,",
    "the basic detector concept is the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( i ) large - acceptance cylindrical configuration with solenoidal magnet , and ( ii ) mass identification using the rigidity and velocity measurements . accordingly",
    ", the presented beam results can be applied to both past and future detectors .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] summarizes experimental setup , after which section  [ sec : anal ] describes incident beam identification which determines @xmath9 .",
    "measurement of the detection efficiency is then presented in section  [ sec : rslt ] , with a study of simulation results being discussed in section  [ sec : dsc ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] summarizes the main results and provides conclusions .",
    "the bess beam experiment was performed in february 1999 at the kek - ps k2 beam line which is equipped with an electro - static separator  @xcite to enrich low energy @xmath4 s .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows a schematic view of the experimental setup at the down stream of the k2 beam line .",
    "d2 is a dipole magnet , q6 and q7 are quadrapole magnets .",
    "they are used for beam transport and focusing .",
    "kurama is another dipole magnet to analyze momentum of the incident particles .",
    "the bess detector was rotated circumferentially 70@xmath12 in @xmath13-@xmath14 plane ( a plane perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid ) such that it was suitably positioned in the beam line for proper ( from top to bottom ) beam incidence . to identify incident particles and to reject interacted events",
    ", we placed four trigger counters ( t1t4 ) , two drift chambers ( dc1 and dc2 ) , and an aerogel cherenkov counter ( ac ) in the beam line ( for details , see figure caption ) .",
    "ac uses 8-cm thick aerogel radiator with a refractive index of 1.03 . , width=510 ]    data from the bess detector and beam line detectors are collected using the bess data acquisition system . to obtain @xmath9 , instead of using the bess standard trigger ( coincidence between upper and lower tof counters ) ,",
    "the trigger was generated by t1 & t2 & t3 & t4 & @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath15 remarkably improves the @xmath4/@xmath16 ratio .",
    "data were collected for three different detector configurations to represent the typical incidence of cosmic - ray particles in terms of the amount of material and penetrated region .",
    "three configurations , cfg13 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : posi ] together with typical @xmath4 trajectories .",
    "the kinetic energy of incident particles at the bess top of instrument ( @xmath17 ) ranges from 0.1 to 1  gev ( 0.4 to 1  gev ) for @xmath4 s ( @xmath11 s ) .",
    "the bess detector can not be rotated more than 70 @xmath12 due to a constraint of the internal structure of the liquid helium storage .",
    "therefore , low energy @xmath11 s were out of the bess acceptance region in this beam experiment due to the opposite deflection .",
    "beams for three configurations ( cfg13 ) . using cfg1 as a reference",
    ", cfg2 is the case in which the incident beam has an angle of cos@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is defined as the angle between the beam and @xmath20-axis in the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane .",
    "cfg3 is the case in which the incident beam passes through a different region of the central tracking system in @xmath13-@xmath14 plane .",

    ", width=151 ]",
    "to determine @xmath9 the beam line detectors must unambiguously identify the incident particle and precisely determine incident energy , position , and angle .",
    "the incident kinetic energy , @xmath17 , was derived from @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , the velocity of incident particle , was obtained from a pair of timing measurements .",
    "note that ( i ) less accurate energy resolution was obtained from the deflection measurement due to the multiple scattering and limited track length , and ( ii ) it is not appropriate to derive the incident energy from the @xmath24 , etc . due to the energy losses in the beam line in spite of the much better @xmath25 resolution .",
    "the accuracy of energy determination was 1  % in the very low energy region around 0.2  gev .",
    "around 1  gev , energy determination is obtained with 4  % accuracy due to the constant @xmath26 resolution .",
    "systematic error of the absolute energy is estimated to be @xmath0 1  % due to calibration of the time of flight measurements and energy losses in the beam line . the beam trajectory obtained by dc1 and dc2",
    "is extrapolated to the bess detector taking into account the fringing field of the solenoid .",
    "the accuracy of the incident position and angle around 1  gev were 2.5 mm and 2 mrad ( rms deviation ) , respectively .",
    "to identify @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s , we required that the energy losses in t1  t4 and the velocities measured by various combination of trigger counters are consistent with @xmath11 s .",
    "figure  [ fig : id ] shows examples of these cuts for @xmath4 s of @xmath27 1  gev . since @xmath25 distribution shows a clear separation between @xmath4 , kaon , and pion / muon / electron particles which allows incident beam particles to be unambiguously identified .     and d@xmath2/d@xmath3 cut by trigger counters for @xmath4 s of @xmath27 1.0  gev .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath26 , and d@xmath2/d@xmath29 are shown in ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the hatched histogram indicates events survived after applying the @xmath4 beam selection.,width=510 ]    to ensure that incident particles arrive at the top of the bess instrument , we further required ( i ) at least one hit in the upper tof hodoscope and ( ii ) beam trajectory agreement with the upper tof hit position in both @xmath13-@xmath14 and @xmath20-@xmath21 planes , where the hit point in tof is obtained from the segmentation of hodoscope in @xmath14 direction and timing difference of pmt at the both end in @xmath21 direction .",
    "these two requirements guaranteed that the incident particles pass through t4 and ac without large angle scattering or interaction , resulting in the precise determination of @xmath9 .    in order to compare the beam data and bess mc results , a mc data set was generated as follows . to estimate interaction and energy losses in t4 and ac , which were located just upstream of bess ,",
    "they were described in the bess mc . input kinematics of beam particles was obtained from beam data event by event .",
    "this allows comparisons between beam data and mc results under the same conditions .",
    "data sets are referred to as beam   and mc   samples , respectively .      in order to select non - interacting @xmath4 s",
    ", we applied the same cuts as those used in the standard @xmath4 analysis for the flight data  @xcite :    1 .",
    "select events with a single downward - traveling particle fully contained in the fiducial region of the tracking detectors ; 2 .",
    "require only one ( one or two ) hit in the upper ( lower ) tof hodoscopes @xcite ; 3 .",
    "require the tof hit position consistent with the extrapolation of the trajectory determined by jet and idcs ( not by beam line trackers ) ; 4 .",
    "require that d@xmath2/d@xmath3 measurements of upper and lower tof are consistent with those of @xmath11 s ; 5 .   require a quality track in terms of fitting chi - squares , number of hits used in fitting , and etc . ; 6 .",
    "require that the mass derived from momentum and velocity measurements is consistent with @xmath11 mass",
    ".    cuts ( 1)(4 ) reject most of the events with interactions .",
    "distributions of the cut parameters are provided in ref .",
    "cut ( 5 ) assures the quality of momentum and velocity measurements .",
    "cut ( 6 ) is to identify @xmath4 s .",
    "selection criteria for @xmath11 s are identical to the above except for the sign of momentum .",
    "the efficiencies of cuts ( 1)(4 ) are different for @xmath11 s and @xmath4 s because of the different interaction cross sections .",
    "however , the efficiencies of cuts ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are the same for @xmath11 s and @xmath4 s due to the symmetrical configuration of the detector .",
    "therefore , we express the detection efficiency ( @xmath7 ) as the product of the non - interacting efficiency ( @xmath30 ) associated to the cuts ( 1)(4 ) and the quality and particle - identification efficiency ( @xmath31 ) associated to cuts ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) : @xmath32 since @xmath33 relies on the mc   calculation and @xmath31 can be estimated by using the @xmath11 sample in the flight data , we should verify the former efficiency by the beam experiment .      the following beam related corrections",
    "are applied to @xmath33 and the systematic errors are estimated .    1",
    ".   beam dump effect : annihilation of @xmath4 s at the beam dump located 3  m downstream of the bess detector produces secondary particles , some of which generate delayed hits in the tof counters . after eliminating the beam dump effect by removing the delayed hits from the hits in the upper and lower tof hodoscopes ,",
    "the remaining correction was negligible .",
    "the systematic uncertainty was estimated to be 0.002 . 2 .",
    "accidental tracks : multi - track events without a vertex in the detector were considered to be a beam - related accidental track and the track is removed from the event .",
    "however , an accidental track would be mis - identified as an interaction if the accidental particle is close to the incident @xmath4 .",
    "the remaining correction for mis - identification was 0.001  0.005 and the systematic uncertainty of the @xmath33 was estimated to be 0.001 .",
    "the correction and its error for @xmath11 s were negligible because of the smaller incident beam intensity .",
    "interaction at upper tof : the use of upper tof information to identify the non - interacting beam entering the bess detector rejects a small fraction of events with interaction inside bess , which underestimates @xmath9 and thus overestimates @xmath33 .",
    "the correction for this effect was estimated by varying the cut parameters of the selections and was estimated to be @xmath340.01  @xmath340.005 .",
    "the rms deviation of the difference in @xmath33 between beam   and mc   results was taken as the systematic uncertainty , which was evaluated to be 0.005 .",
    "beam energy : since the systematic uncertainty of the beam energy is @xmath01  % , the corresponding uncertainty in @xmath33 is negligible for energies above 0.16  gev .",
    "however , it is difficult to reliably estimate the corresponding systematic errors in @xmath33 derived from beambelow 0.16  gev , where @xmath33 changes rapidly with energy .    in total , beam",
    "related systematic uncertainty was estimated to be less than 0.01 for energies up to 1  gev except for very low energy region where the efficiency rapidly changes with energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : effdir ] shows @xmath33 for @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s for each configuration derived from beam   and mc   samples . reflecting the energy dependence of cross sections , @xmath30 for @xmath4 s gradually decreases with decreasing energy , while @xmath33 for @xmath11 s shows little dependence on energy . among beam  data ,",
    "the differences between cfg13 in @xmath33 are 7 , 5 , and 3  % at energies of 0.2 , 0.4 , and 1  gev , respectively .",
    "although large discrepancies exist below 0.16  gev where @xmath33 rapidly drops due to stopping of incident @xmath4 s in the instrument , they can be explained by the systematic uncertainty of 1  % in the beam energy determination .     for @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s in ( a ) cfg1 , ( b ) cfg2 , and ( c ) cfg3 .",

    "i.e. _ , the maximum deviation of @xmath38 between all configurations are close to the statistical accuracy of each data point for all energies ( mostly @xmath39 0.005 ) .",
    "note that cfg13 were selected to represent the typical incidence of cosmic - ray particles , and the properties of non - interacting particles show very good agreement between beam   and mc   samples .    as a result",
    ", these results clearly demonstrates that above 0.16  gev ( for @xmath11 s above 0.4  gev ) systematic error in @xmath33 is determined to be within @xmath05  % ( @xmath02  % ) . since systematic error in @xmath31",
    "was well estimated to be within @xmath01  % using unbiased @xmath11 sample in flight data , systematic error in @xmath33 can be considered as that in detection efficiency .",
    "in a detailed study of the interaction processes in the bess mc  @xcite , we found no significant difference in @xmath33 for different hadronic packages , gheisha and fluka  @xcite ( implemented in geant3 , denoted as gfluka ) if we assume the same total inelastic cross section .",

    "as a result we confirmed that the amount of material was correctly implemented in the bess mc with an accuracy of @xmath00.5  g / cm@xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath391/3 of the incident particles interact in the instrument , the @xmath05  % agreement between the measured and calculated efficiencies means that the previous measurements of @xmath4-nuclei inelastic cross sections were verified at least within an accuracy of about @xmath015  % .",

    "through an accelerator beam experiment , measurements of the detection efficiency for @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s in bess were performed below 1  gev . the measurements and following studies indicated that the detection efficiency was mainly determined from material amount in the instrument and cross sections with nuclei , essentially regardless of the simulation details such as multiplicity and angular distribution of secondaries . as a result , we confirmed that the relative systematic error in detection efficiency derived from the simulation was kept below 5% and 2% for @xmath4 s and @xmath11 s , respectively . it can be applied to systematic errors in cosmic - ray @xmath4 measurements @xcite , as well as future bess experiments including",
