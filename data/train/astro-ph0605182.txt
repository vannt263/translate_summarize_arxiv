    "dust grains strongly affect our observations , especially in the ultra - violet ( uv ) band , through _ extinction _ ( absorption and scattering processes ) .",
    "when we observe galaxies whose stars are not resolved by a telescope , the effects of the radiative transfer , i.e. , multiple scatterings and the configuration of dust grains and stars , are also effective . in this paper , we call the effective extinction including such effects _ attenuation_. to correctly understand the intrinsic spectrum of galaxies ( unresolved into individual stars ) , we must correct observational data for the dust _ attenuation _ not for the _",
    "extinction_.    theoretically , to know the dust attenuation through a galactic disc is to solve the equation of the radiative transfer through the disc , assuming the wavelength dependence of average dust properties of absorption and scattering , i.e. , the _ extinction law_. the most prominent feature in the average extinction law of the milky way ( mw ) is the absorption `` bump '' at 2175  .",
    "we find this feature toward almost all lines of sight in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the carrier of the bump is quite common in the ism of the mw .",
    "we also find the bump in the average extinction law of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) but not in the average extinction law of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , the wavelength dependence of the attenuation amount , i.e. , the _ attenuation law _ , has been obtained for nearby uv bright starburst galaxies observed with the _ iue _ satellite @xcite . in an average attenuation law of these galaxies",
    "( so - called the calzetti law ) , the bump is very weak or absent @xcite , although some galaxies in the sample show a sign of the bump in their spectra @xcite .",
    "based on a radiative transfer model , @xcite and @xcite argued that this lack of the bump in the calzetti law is a sign of the absence of the bump in the extinction law , suggesting the absence of the bump carrier in the starburst region . on the other hand , with another radiative transfer model , grasil @xcite , @xcite pointed out that , even if the bump exists in the extinction law , the strength of the bump can be greatly reduced in the attenuation law by a radiative transfer effect coupled with an _ age - selective attenuation _ , i.e. young stars are more attenuated selectively .",
    "the _ iue _ starburst galaxies also show a tight correlation between the observed uv spectral slope ( @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ) and the infrared ( ir)-to - uv flux ratio ( so - called irx ) : a redder @xmath0 for a larger irx @xcite .",
    "since the irx well relates to the uv attenuation @xcite , the correlation means that the uv spectrum ( i.e. the uv colour ) becomes redder monotonically as the attenuation increases .",
    "@xcite argued that the uv colour can not be redden by the extinction law of the mw even if the dust column density of a medium increases .",
    "this is because the absorption bump lies in the near - uv ( nuv ) .",
    "indeed , the extinction in the nuv is slightly larger than that in the far - uv ( fuv ) for the mw extinction law .",
    "their finding again suggests the lack of the bump carrier in the starburst galaxies .",
    "a suggested candidate of the bump carrier is very small carbonaceous grains like pahs ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ; @xcite ) , qccs ( quenched carbonaceous composites ; @xcite ) , and uv processed hacs ( hydrogenerated amorphous carbon grains ; @xcite ) , although this is not settled yet @xcite .",
    "these very small carbonaceous particles are confidently attributed to the unidentified infrared ( uir ) emission band in 313   @xcite .",
    "the uir emission band is quite common in the ism of the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of other galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for low - metallicity ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) galaxies in which the uir emission is weak or absent @xcite .",
    "if the very small carbonaceous grains producing the uir emission are really responsible for the bump , we should find the bump in the extinction law of other galaxies ( but not so low - metallicity ) . indeed , the bump found in m31 @xcite and some distant galaxies , for example , a lensing galaxy at @xmath4 @xcite and mg ii absorption systems at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there are also signs of the bump imprinted in the observed uv spectra of a galaxy at @xmath6 @xcite , of some _ iue _ starburst galaxies @xcite , and of some star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the amount of the bump carrier may depend on the star - forming activity ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite found one sight line with the bump in the smc .",
    "interestingly , this sight line is toward a quiescent area in the smc .",
    "@xcite found one sight line without the bump toward an actively star - forming region ( trumpler 37 ) in the mw ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also found a sight line without the bump toward a molecular cloud in the mw ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , the uir emission flux ( possibly related to the bump carrier ) relative to the far - ir flux decreases as the intensity of the interstellar radiation field increases @xcite .",
    "such a bump carrier fragile against the star - forming activity may explain the absence of the bump in the calzetti law . on the other hand , there is a good correlation between the uir emission strength and the star - forming activity for starburst galaxies as well as for normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "quiescent or modest star - forming `` normal '' galaxies and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) do not follow the tight correlation of the _ iue _ starburst galaxies on the irx-@xmath0 diagram @xcite .",
    "particularly , normal galaxies show systematically redder uv colours than those of the _ iue _ starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "this fact has recently been confirmed by the _",
    "satellite @xcite for larger samples of nearby galaxies selected in the nuv or optical @xcite .",
    "resolved star - forming regions ( aperture size of 520 pc ) in m51 also show the same trend as the normal galaxies on the irx - uv colour diagram @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the mw type dust can not reproduce even the uv colour of the _ iue _ starburst galaxies , much less the redder uv colour of normal galaxies .",
    "does the red uv colour of normal galaxies indicate the lack of the bump carrier in their ism and suggest different origins of the bump and the uir emission ?    with a simple power - law type attenuation law ( i.e. without a bump ) as introduced by @xcite , @xcite claimed that the redder uv colour of normal galaxies is due to a post - burst stellar population if galaxies have an intermittent star formation .",
    "they expected a trend that the current star formation rate relative to the past average one ( so - called the birth - rate parameter ) depends on the distance from the starburst relation on the irx@xmath0 diagram .",
    "however , the observed trend is weak @xcite .",
    "in addition , the expected recent burst of nearby galaxies observed with the _ galex _ seems to be too weak to change their uv colours significantly @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied a more realistic attenuation law , i.e. , a power - law plus a gaussian bump to their statistical investigation in order to understand the nature of _ galex _ galaxies .",
    "they found that an attenuation law with a bump and a somewhat steep slope is suitable for these galaxies .",
    "such a steep attenuation law is expected from an _ age - selective attenuation _ @xcite .",
    "more recently , an updated grasil model @xcite very well reproduced the red uv colours of _ galex _ galaxies with the mw type dust .",
    "they adopted a more realistic stellar distribution ; younger stars are more deeply embedded in the dust disc , whereas older stars distribute more extensively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this realistic configuration of dust and stars depending on the stellar age produces an _ age - selective attenuation_. this results in a steep attenuation law which overcomes the _ blueing _ by the bump .",
    "in addition to the _ age - selective attenuation _ , this paper newly discusses the effect of the wavelength dependence of the scattering albedo on the uv colour .",
    "in fact , the dust properties adopted by @xcite and the grasil are different from each other , especially the wavelength dependence of albedos .",
    "this point significantly affects the expected uv colour as shown later (  3 ) .",
    "@xcite empirically derived the wavelength dependence of the albedo from a large compilation of the albedos estimated from observations with radiative transfer models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "on the other hand , the dust properties adopted in the grasil are a theoretical model by draine and co - workers @xcite .",
    "such a difference in the adopted dust models could play a role in the contradictory conclusions from the two groups .",
    "this paper thoroughly examines dust properties in nearby galaxies , in particular the presence of the bump and the wavelength dependence of the albedo , based on the _ galex _ colour .",
    "we adopt a one - dimensional plane - parallel radiative transfer model developed by @xcite .",
    "while its computational geometry is one - dimensional , this model can treat the clumpiness of stars and dust thanks to the mega - grain approximation @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been clearly shown by @xcite who compared the approximation with a three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer .",
    "owing to the computational cheapness of the one - dimensional calculation , we can investigate a very wide range of physical quantities of disc galaxies .    in the next section",
    ", we present a description of the radiative transfer model , detailed explanations of the dust models , and the set up of the plane - parallel discs .",
    "the main results and discussions are presented in section 3 where we search suitable dust models for nearby `` normal '' galaxies . in section 4 ,",
    "we derive mean attenuation laws as a function of the uv attenuation for future use .",
    "the final section is a summary of our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we use a one - dimensional plane - parallel radiative transfer model through a galactic disc with clumpy distributions of stars and dust developed by @xcite .",
    "the clumpiness of the medium ( i.e. the dust distribution ) is treated by the mega - grain approximation which was first proposed by @xcite and further developed by @xcite and @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", we regard a dusty clump as a huge particle producing absorption and scattering effects like a normal single dust grain .",
    "we note that @xcite clearly show the validity of the approximation by comparisons between the approximate solutions and their three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer solutions .",
    "the radiative transfer code of @xcite can also treat a smooth medium if we do not use the mega - grain approximation .",
    "since the global geometry is one - dimensional plane - parallel , we do not consider the bulge and the radial structure of the disc .    by solving the radiative transfer equations in a single configuration of stars and dust , we obtain a transmission rate curve , @xmath8 , which is the ratio of the observable and the intrinsic intensities as a function of the wavelength , @xmath9 .",
    "when there are some stellar populations with different configurations relative to dust in a galactic disc , the total transmission rate through the disc is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transmission rate through the @xmath12-th configuration and @xmath13 is the luminosity weight of the @xmath12-th stellar population with a normalization of @xmath14 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) means that we can solve the radiative transfer equations for each stellar population ( with each configuration relative to dust ) independently . to obtain the total transmission rate ,",
    "we simply sum all the transmission rates with luminosity weights (  2.4 ) .            in the following ,",
    "we describe the dust models considered here (  2.1 ) , the ism model (  2.2 ) , and the stellar populations and distributions (  2.3 ) .",
    "then , we describe how to composite these populations (  2.4 ) .",
    "we consider six dust models in this paper .",
    "table 1 is a summary of the models and their references .",
    "there are two origins of these models ; one is an empirical model by @xcite ( hereafter wg dust ) and the other is a theoretical model by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter draine dust ) .",
    "there are also four types of dust compositions : the mw , the smc , and the two different lmc types ( lmc av and lmc 2 ) .",
    "the lmc av type is an average dust composition over many sight lines toward the lmc , except for the supershell region around the 30 doradus , and the lmc 2 type is the dust composition toward the supershell . in the draine dust ,",
    "the bump is assumed to be produced by very small carbonaceous particles including the `` astronomical '' pahs designed to fit observations @xcite ."
