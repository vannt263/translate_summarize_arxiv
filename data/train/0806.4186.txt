    "the masses of the massive central black holes observed in many galaxies exhibit a variety of scaling relations , such as the m@xmath4 relation between black - hole mass , m@xmath5 , and central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 @xcite and the @xmath6 relation between circular velocity , @xmath7 , and central velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the latter can be interpreted , via the m@xmath4 relation , as a relation between the mass of the central black hole and the total mass of the host galaxy .",
    "these correlations suggest a strong coupling between the formation of massive central black holes and the formation of galaxies .",
    "literature abounds with scenarios for producing massive central black holes .",
    "models designed to explain the properties of qsos in massive galaxies typically produce central seed black holes with a minimum mass of m@xmath8m@xmath1 , e.g. through the collapse of a massive central gaseous disk or a supermassive stellar object @xcite .",
    "this seed can grow even more massive by feeding from a surrounding gas disk .",
    "these models are motivated by the necessity of producing supermassive black holes very rapidly after the big bang and therefore may be biased to large seed masses .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a relativistic star cluster , supposedly born during a starburst , might produce black hole seeds with masses up to @xmath9  m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "scenarios for growing less massive black holes , aptly called intermediate - mass black holes , also exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "their applicability seems to be restricted to very dense systems , such as , for instance , globular clusters or galactic nuclear star clusters , because they rely on dynamical friction to sink stellar - mass seed black holes , possibly originating from popiii objects as suggested by @xcite , to the center of the system on short enough timescales .",
    "the picture becomes even more complicated if the fact that galaxies grow via a process of hierarchical merging is taken into account .",
    "recently , the impact of the co - evolution of central black holes and their host galaxies has been incorporated in semi - analytical models ( sams ) of galaxy evolution .",
    "e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite allow massive central black holes to grow by two processes :  _ ( i ) _ the influx of gas into the galaxy center due to the starburst and the strongly non - axisymmetric forces that accompany a galaxy - galaxy merger , and _",
    "( ii ) _ merging of the black holes after the host galaxies have merged .",
    "these sams can reproduce the aforementioned scaling relations between the black - hole mass and the properties of the host galaxy . using a high - resolution small - volume cosmological n - body / sph simulation , @xcite",
    "show they can grow m@xmath10  m@xmath1 central black holes in milky - way size halos by a redshift of @xmath11 by allowing central black holes to merge if their host galaxies merge and by gas accretion during mergers",
    ".    however , when the members of a binary black - hole system merge , there can be a considerable beaming of the gravitational radiation emitted during the final stages of the plunge .",
    "this results in a recoil of the newly formed black hole .",
    "fully relativistic calculations of black - hole binary mergers have shown that this recoil velocity can be as high as a few hundred  km  s@xmath12 , depending on the holes spin , orientation , and orbital eccentricity @xcite .",
    "this could potentially hamper the retention of black holes in merging low - mass protogalaxies and by extension the build - up of supermassive black holes .    clearly , the search for massive central black holes in low - mass galaxies is of considerable interest for the study of the symbiosis of host galaxies and their central black holes and for constraining the minimum mass of seed black holes .",
    "nuclear activity in dwarf galaxies has turned up a number of central black holes with estimated masses in the range m@xmath13  m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "dynamical modeling of ground - based stellar kinematics of dwarf elliptical galaxies ruled out the presence of central black holes with masses m@xmath14  m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "obtaining and modeling high - quality stellar kinematics of faint dwarf galaxies is , unfortunately , a very time - consuming way of searching for inactive central black holes .",
    "this prompted us to look for a more efficient , photometry - based method . using archival hst images",
    ", we found the virgo cluster dwarf elliptical galaxy ( or de ) vcc128 to harbour a binary nucleus @xcite . at the time , only two other galaxies with binary nuclei were known : m31 and ngc4486b @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the binary nucleus was interpreted as the observable signature of a stellar disk orbiting a central massive black hole @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the binary nucleus in vcc128 might also be the hallmark of a central massive black hole .",
    "however , the presence of a central massive black hole in vcc128 still needs to be established by independent means .",
    "an observationally rather undemanding method for detecting massive central black holes is through the radio emission they produce when they accrete gas . in section [ rce ] ,",
    "we give a short discussion of this method , followed by an account of our radio continuum observations of vcc128 with the very large array ( vla ) in section [ obs ] .",
    "we end by presenting our results and conclusions in section [ results ] .",
    "in order to predict the expected radio continuum flux density of an actively accreting bh , we need an estimate of the bh s mass . in the case of",
    "vcc128 we can make use of the optical photometry from hubble of the double nuclei . by comparing the observed sed of the nuclei with population synthesis models",
    ", we estimated the combined nuclear stellar mass at @xmath15  m@xmath1 . assuming that the disk to black - hole mass ratios of m31 ( m@xmath16/m@xmath17 ) and ngc4486b ( m@xmath16/m@xmath18 ) are typical , @xcite estimated the mass of the putative black hole in vcc128 at m@xmath19  m@xmath1 . as a verification they used the faber - jackson relation of des in order to estimate the galaxy s central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , at @xmath20  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the empirical scaling m@xmath4 relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite observationally derived a fundamental plane relation between 5  ghz radio luminosities @xmath21 , x - ray luminosities @xmath22 and bh masses m@xmath5 of galactic and extragalactic bhs .",
    "unfortunately , an x - ray luminosity does not exist for vcc128 .",
    "still , the fundamental plane relation and its projections provide us with a useful tool to estimate the radio continuum flux density produced by vcc128 if an actively accreting bh were present ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) . from fig",
    ". 2 in @xcite , for m@xmath23  m@xmath1 one would expect a 5  ghz radio luminosity well above @xmath24 erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "an alternative method to obtain the radio flux @xmath25 without knowing @xmath22 is proposed by @xcite , assuming a flat radio spectrum and the fundamental - plane relationship between radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and black hole mass @xcite . for a given gas accretion rate onto the black hole , expressed as a fraction of the bondi accretion rate which depends on the gas density and temperature , the x - ray luminosity can be calculated , assuming that 10  % of the rest mass energy of the infalling matter is converted into radiation .",
    "unfortunately , no h@xmath26 imaging or 21  cm radio line emission data are available for vcc128 , leaving us without direct constraints on the gas density and temperature or even an indication that gas is at all present in this dwarf galaxy .",
    "thus , it is in principle possible to detect massive central black holes and to estimate their masses ( or place broad upper limits thereon ) , allowing for a large uncertainty due to the combination of several empirical scaling relations and the unknown properties of the accreting gas , using straightforward and relatively short radio observations .",
    "we wish to stress that the detection of a radio continuum signal from the center of vcc128 would provide strong evidence for the presence of a central black hole , independent of the reliability and accuracy of the methods with which we can estimate its mass .",
    "we observed vcc128 with the very large array ( vla ) in new mexico ( usa ) around midnight of june 28 , 2007 ( project number ab1248 ) .",
    "the vla is being replaced gradually by the expanded vla ( evla ) and , therefore , at the time of our observations consisted of 16 antennas . the radio continuum emission in a region around the center of the galaxy",
    "was mapped in the x - band ( 8.6  ghz ) , which is at the vla s maximum sensitivity .",
    "the vla was in its a configuration at that time , yielding a spatial resolution of @xmath27 corresponding to 19  pc at the distance of vcc128 ( 16.5  mpc ) .",
    "the total project time was @xmath28 . at startup ,",
    "the flux calibrator 1331 + 305 was observed for 7 minutes , followed by alternating observations of the phase calibrator 1222 + 042 ( with an angular separation of 5.5@xmath29 from vcc128 ) with a 2 minute exposure time and the galaxy vcc128 with a 15 minute exposure time .",
    "this gives a total on - source integration time of 129 minutes .",
    "standard flagging and calibration of the @xmath30 data was performed with the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "we preferred to use miriad @xcite to derive a natural weighted map .",
    "this map was cleaned ( 1000 iterations ) and yields a final image beam size of 0.19@xmath310.18@xmath3 .",
    "we created a radio continuum map of the central @xmath32 region of vcc128 with an rms noise of @xmath33jy / beam .",
    "this map is presented in fig .",
    "[ ima_128 ] , overplotted on a v - band image of vcc128 obtained with fors1 mounted on the vlt ( eso program 079.b-0632(b ) ) .",
    "the data reduction and analysis of the optical imaging of vcc128 will be reported in detail elsewhere .",
    "a 4@xmath2 detection of a point source was made at r.a .",
    "@xmath34 , dec . @xmath35 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this is 4.63@xmath3 sw of the binary nucleus .",
    "the source has a flux density of @xmath36  mjy .",
    "unfortunately , no emission was found at the optical position of the nucleus .",
    "since we do not detect any radio emission coming from the center of vcc128 , we can only place a @xmath37jy @xmath38 upper limit on the radio continuum emission of the putative central black hole . assuming a flat radio spectrum",
    ", this corresponds to a @xmath38 upper limit on the 5  ghz radio luminosity of @xmath39  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "this is lower than the expected radio luminosity of an actively accreting bh with a mass m@xmath40  m@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that either _",
    "( i ) _ vcc128 does not contain a central massive black hole or , alternatively , _",
    "( ii ) _ vcc128 might contain a central massive black hole with a mass of the order of a few @xmath41  m@xmath1 but the gas near the galaxy center is either too hot or too rarefied or conditions near the black hole are unsuitable for efficient accretion .",
    "in the former case , one needs to rethink the nature of the binary nucleus . as detailed in @xcite , all other explanations for the binary nucleus other than it",
    "being the observational signature of a stellar disk rely on rather contrived chance configurations .",
