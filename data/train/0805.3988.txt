    "the asymmetric hubbard model is one of the simplest models for a description of correlated fermions on the lattice .",
    "it has been used in the literature to study a great variety of many - body effects in rare - earth and transition - metal compounds , of which quantum phase transitions , mixed - valence phenomena , charge - density waves , and electronic ferroelectricity are the most common examples  @xcite . in the last few years",
    "the asymmetric hubbard model was also used for a description of ground - state properties of fermionic particles on the optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of two species of electrons : heavy @xmath2 electrons and light @xmath3 electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is    @xmath7    where @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of heavy and light electron at lattice site @xmath12 .",
    "the first two terms of ( 1 ) are the kinetic energies corresponding to quantum - mechanical hopping of @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons between the nearest neighbor sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 with hopping probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the third term represents the on - site coulomb interaction between the @xmath3 electrons with density @xmath16 and the @xmath2 electrons with density @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the model is called `` asymmetric '' because the hopping integrals for @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons may be different .",
    "usually , the hopping integral of the @xmath3 electrons is taken to be the unit of energy @xmath19 and the @xmath2-electron hopping integral is considered in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "this is a reason why the @xmath3 electrons are called light and the @xmath2 electrons heavy .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) reduces to the spinless falicov - kimball model for @xmath21 and to the usual one - band hubbard model for @xmath22 .",
    "thus the asymmetric hubbard model can we viewed as a generalized falicov - kimball model and also as a generalized one - band hubbard model .    the first systematic study of ground - state properties of the asymmetric hubbard model has been performed by lyzwa et al . using various analytical and numerical techniques  @xcite . in the first paper from this series",
    "the authors studied the ground - state properties of the one dimensional asymmetric hubbard model by own approximate method that allowed to treat larger clusters than accessible by exact diagonalization technique .",
    "their method was based on the sequence of two steps .",
    "first , they found the lowest - energy state for every permissible @xmath2-electron configuration , similarly as in the pure spinless falicov - kimball model ( @xmath21 ) . to do this the matrices of rank @xmath23 had to be diagonalized .",
    "second , they took the states thus found as a basis of a new matrix of rank @xmath24 that was subsequently diagonalized .",
    "the lowest - energy eigenstate of this matrix was then used to construct the approximate ground state . the main result obtained by the application of this method to",
    "the asymmetric hubbard model was that the motion of the heavy electrons is strongly influenced by the light ones , while the light electrons are almost unaffected by the presence of the heavy ones .",
    "the subsequent study  @xcite of the asymmetric hubbard model on the one - dimensional ring with two @xmath2 and two @xmath3 electrons showed that an effective attraction between two @xmath2-electrons can be produced by correlation effects for a certain set of the model parameters .",
    "the same result , an effective attraction between two heavy electrons mediated by two light electrons leading to the phase segregation , was confirmed also in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the phase segregation is own not only to the falicov - kimball model  @xcite , but persists also at finite @xmath15 .",
    "for strong interactions this result was proven rigorously by ueltschi  @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the phase segregation / separation region in the @xmath25 plane has been calculated very recently by two different methods . to identify the transition boundary gu at al .",
    "@xcite used the quantum entanglement between a local part and the rest of the system and the structure factor of charge - density wave ( cdw ) for heavy electrons . away from half - filling",
    ", they found that the domain of phase separation is not confined only to small @xmath15 , but persists up to relative large values of @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xmath26 for intermediate coulomb interactions @xmath27 ) and with increasing @xmath28 is further stabilized .",
    "the same result has been obtained also by wang et al . using the bosonization method  @xcite .    in the current paper",
    "we study the ground - state phase diagram of the asymmetric hubbard model by an improved lyzwa s scheme  @xcite discussed above .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can treat much larger clusters than accessible by exact diagonalization technique and its applicability , unlike the dmrg  @xcite or bosonization  @xcite method , is not confined only to the one - dimensional case .",
    "moreover , the method allows to calculate directly the probabilities of particular @xmath2 electron configurations and thus to specify the stability domains corresponding to distributions with the highest probabilities .",
    "before discussing our approach , it is useful and instructive to summarize main steps of the numerical algorithm leading to the exact solution of the spinless falicov - kimball model on finite clusters .",
    "the asymmetric hubbard model ( 1 ) reduces to the spinless falicov - kimball model for @xmath21 .",
    "its hamiltonian reads    @xmath29    since in this version , without @xmath2-electron hopping , the @xmath2-electron occupation number @xmath30 of each site @xmath12 commutes with the hamiltonian ( 2 ) , the @xmath2-electron occupation number is a good quantum number and can be replaced by classical variables @xmath31 or 0 , according to whether or not the site @xmath12 is occupied by the localized @xmath2 electron .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( 2 ) can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the nearest neighbor ; @xmath34 , if @xmath35 and zero otherwise .",
    "thus for a given @xmath2-electron configuration @xmath36 defined on the one , two , or three - dimensional lattice , the hamiltonian ( 3 ) is the second - quantized version of the single - particle hamiltonian and can be directly diagonalized by the following canonical transformation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath39 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath40 is then constructed as follows @xmath41 and the corresponding ground - state energy is simply given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 are eigenvalues of the single particle matrix @xmath39 .",
    "generalizing this procedure our approach to the full hamiltonian of the asymmetric hubbard model ( 1 ) can be formulated in the following two points : first , we construct the reduced basis @xmath45 of @xmath46 by making the ansatz @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the complete set of eigenstates of the @xmath2-electron subsystem @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the ground state corresponding to @xmath48 ( note that @xmath51=@xmath52 ) .",
    "second , the reduced basis @xmath45 is used to calculate the matrix elements @xmath53 of the full hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "this matrix is then diagonalized and its lowest energy eigenvalue @xmath54 yields the upper bound for the ground state energy of @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath57 ) is the approximate ground state and can be used directly to calculate the expectation value of any operator @xmath58 . using expressions ( 4 - 8 )",
    "one can show easily that any ground - state expectation value can be written directly in terms of the unitary matrices @xmath38 that diagonalize the single - particle matrices @xmath39 corresponding to all possible distributions of @xmath2-electrons .    to establish connection between our approach and lyzwa s one",
    "let us calculate explicitly the matrix elements @xmath57 of the total hamiltonian of the asymmetric hubbard model ( 1 ) .",
    "making use of the fact that the new creation ( @xmath59 ) and annihilation ( @xmath60 ) operators obey the following commutation relation @xmath61 where the matrix elements @xmath62 are given by @xmath63 the straightforward calculations lead to the following expressions for the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath46 @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of permutations that should be done to transform @xmath67 on @xmath68 by @xmath69 .",
    "as discussed bellow the lyzwa s approach can be recovered directly from eq .",
    "12 by putting @xmath70 , however generally @xmath71 .    to test our method",
    "we have first calculated the ground - state energy of the asymmetric hubbard model for various model parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath28 ) on small one - dimensional clusters where exact results are also accessible . in table  1 and table  2",
    "we present the exact and approximate ground - state energies obtained for the finite clusters of @xmath72 and 10 sites , two representative values of @xmath15 ( @xmath15=0.1 , 1 ) and three representative values of @xmath28 ( @xmath28=0.1 , 1 , 10 ) . for a comparison we have included into table  1",
    "also results obtained by lyzwa et al .",
    "@xcite and we have verified numerically that these results can be recovered exactly by our method simply putting @xmath73 in the eq .  12 . comparing these results",
    "one can see that both approaches work very well in the weak - coupling limit ( @xmath74 ) , while in the opposite limit ( @xmath75 ) our method yields a considerable better estimation of the ground - states energy than the lyzwa s one .",
    "1 demonstrates that this trend holds also for smaller values of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , as one can expect intuitively , the accordance between our results and the exact ones considerably improves with decreasing @xmath15 and for a sufficiently strong asymmetry ( @xmath76 ) a nice accordance of results is observed over the whole interval of coulomb interactions ( see also table  2 ) .",
    "to verify the ability of our method to describe the main characteristics of the exact ground state we have also calculated the @xmath2-electron pair correlation function @xmath77 defined by  @xcite @xmath78 the results of numerical computations are summarized in fig .",
    "it is seen that a nice accordance with exact behaviors is obtained in the weak ( @xmath79 ) as well as strong ( @xmath80 ) coupling limit for both small ( @xmath81 ) and intermediate ( @xmath82 ) values of @xmath2-electron hopping integrals .",
    "one of the greatest advantages of the method discussed above is that it allows to calculate directly the probability of any @xmath2-electron configuration in the approximate ground state .",
    "we used this fact to construct the phase diagrams of the asymmetric hubbard model in the @xmath83 plane for various sizes of clusters and electron fillings .",
    "the phases presented in the phase diagrams are those corresponding to @xmath2-electron distributions with the highest probabilities for given values of @xmath15 and @xmath28 .",
    "the typical examples of ground - state phase diagrams of the asymmetric hubbard model are displayed in fig .  3 for @xmath84 and four representative values of @xmath2-electron filling @xmath85 (",
    "note that @xmath86 ) .",
    "a general feature which can be noticed in these pictures is that the basic structure of the phase diagrams is formed by only two main types of the @xmath2-electron configurations , and namely , the most homogeneous distributions @xmath87 ( the @xmath2 electrons are distributed homogeneously over the whole lattice ) and the phase separated configurations ( the @xmath2 electrons occupy only one part of the lattice while the remaining one is empty ) . as discussed below , between the phase separated configurations the special role play the phase segregated configurations ( all @xmath2 electrons clump together ) and therefore they are considered here as the independent group . in the language of an effective interaction between the @xmath2 electrons ,",
    "the most homogeneous configurations correspond to an effective repulsion and the phase separated / segregated configurations to an effective attraction between the @xmath2 electrons . from this point of view , it is very interesting that in the pure electronic system ( with only the on - site coulomb repulsion between the light and heavy electrons ) an effective attraction between the @xmath2 electrons is produced , even for @xmath15 away from the falicov - kimball limit @xmath21 . indeed ,",
    "our results show that the phase boundary @xmath88 between the most homogeneous and phase - separated / segregated regions increases rapidly with increasing @xmath28 and reaches the intermediate values @xmath89 already for intermediate coulomb interactions . in the weak coupling and low density limit",
    ", the phase boundary scales like @xmath90 , while at higher electron fillings ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) the phase - separated / segregated distributions are stabilized above some critical value of coulomb interaction @xmath28 ( @xmath93 for @xmath91 and @xmath94 for @xmath92 ) . in these limiting cases",
    "our results reproduce the analytical and numerical results obtained recently by bosonization  @xcite and exact - diagonalization / dmrg method  @xcite . comparing our results with the exact - diagonalization / dmrg results  @xcite ( @xmath91 )",
    "one can see that these results agree very well in spite of the fact that fully different approaches have been used to identify the phase separated region .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it also allows us to identify the internal structure of the phase diagrams and thereby to study how this structure changes by varying the model parameters .",
    "3 shows that the phase diagrams of the asymmetric hubbard model ( strictly said the phase - separated domains ) have a rich internal structure that exhibits some general trends .",
    "first , the phase separated region starts with the phase segregated distribution .",
    "small exceptions are found only for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where also some other phases are observed for @xmath95 , but their stability regions are very limited .",
    "second , the segregated cluster of length @xmath96 splits into two or more smaller clusters with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "third , the segregated configuration is stabilized with increasing electron filling , while the separated phases disappear from the phase diagrams .",
    "although the cluster used in our numerical calculations is relatively large ( @xmath84 ) to exclude completely the finite size effects the same calculations have been performed on several different clusters for each selected value of electron filling .",
    "we have found that the fundamental characteristics of the phase diagrams discussed above , and namely , the phase boundary between the phase - separated and most homogeneous phase , the phase boundary of segregated phase , the critical value of coulomb interactions at which the phase separation starts for large @xmath2-electron fillings are almost independent of @xmath18 .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .  4 where the boundary of phase separation is plotted for two different values of @xmath85 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "this analysis indicates that our one - dimensional results can be extrapolated satisfactorily to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "since the phenomenon of phase separation is one of the most interesting problems in the condensed matter physics we extend our calculations also on the two - dimensional case .",
    "as discussed above such an extension is possible due to the fact that instead the full hilbert space we work only with the reduced basis and corresponding reduced matrices of rank @xmath24 .",
    "this allows us to study the two - dimensional clusters up to @xmath98 sites that are far away beyond the reach of present day computers within the exact diagonalization calculations .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations obtained for two different values of electron fillings are summarized in fig .  5 in the form of @xmath83 phase diagrams together with the complete list of @xmath2-electron configurations with the highest probabilities .",
    "it is seen that all main features of the one - dimensional phase diagrams hold in two dimensions , too . for small values of @xmath2-electron hopping the system",
    "is phase segregated / separated , while increasing @xmath15 stabilizes the homogeneous distribution of @xmath2 electrons . in accordance with the one - dimensional case",
    "we have found that the phase boundary @xmath99 between the homogeneous and phase separated region scales like @xmath100 for weak interactions , and that the region of phase segregation / separation increases rapidly with increasing @xmath85 .    in summary",
    ", we have presented an improved numerical scheme for calculating ground - state properties of the asymmetric hubbard model .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can treat much larger clusters than accessible by exact diagonalization technique and its applicability , unlike the dmrg or bosonization method , is not confined only to the one - dimensional case .",
    "moreover , the method allows to calculate directly the probabilities of particular @xmath2 electron configurations and thus to specify the stability domains corresponding to distributions with the highest probabilities .",
    "we have used this fact to construct the ground - state phase diagrams of the asymmetric hubbard model in one and two dimensions for wide range of model parameters .",
    "we have found that at low electron fillings ( @xmath4 ) the ground states are always phase segregated for a strong asymmetry between the hopping integral of @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath5 ) . with decreasing asymmetry",
    "the system undergoes a transition to the phase separated state and then to the homogeneous state . for electron fillings @xmath101 and weak coulomb interactions the ground state ( in one dimension ) is homogeneous for all values of asymmetry , while for intermediate and strong interactions the system exhibits the same sequence of phase transitions as for @xmath0 small .",
