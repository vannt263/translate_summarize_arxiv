    "dynamics of classical ising spin systems have been studied extensively using the glauber dynamic @xcite .",
    "the glauber dynamic was later also derived by martin @xcite starting from a quantum hamiltonian consisting of an exchange interaction and a coupling to a _",
    "fermionic _ thermal heat bath attached to each spin .",
    "this derivation was performed in a weak - coupling limit in which the square of the coupling constant multiplied by a characteristic time becomes an arbitrary finite constant . in this limit ,",
    "the time evolution of the system was proved to be markovian .    a different",
    "dynamic would change the time evolution of the system , but not its equilibrium properties . here",
    "we study the quantum nearest - neighbor ising ferromagnet with an applied longitudinal magnetic field and a linear coupling between the ising spins and a phonon ( i.e. bosonic ) heat bath .",
    "we calculated the transition rates from one configuration to another resulting from the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "we then applied these transition rates to dynamic monte carlo simulations and measured the average lifetimes @xmath1 of the metastable state @xcite . to measure @xmath1",
    ", we set the initial configuration with all spins up and applied a magnetic field @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "we define @xmath1 as the number of spin - flip attempts until the magnetization reaches zero .",
    "exact predictions @xcite of the lifetime @xmath1 as @xmath5@xmath6@xmath4 are given by @xmath7 where the linear critical droplet size is @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the smallest integer not less than @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the energy cost of a critical droplet .",
    "the critical droplet is a cluster of overturned spins which is an @xmath14 rectangle with one additional overturned spin on one of the long sides of the rectangle .",
    "this formula is valid for @xmath15 not an integer and @xmath16@xmath3@xmath17 . here",
    "we show that the specific dynamic crucially affects the time evolution of the system .",
    "the total hamiltonian we use is @xmath18 .",

    "assuming that the correlation time of the heat bath is much shorter than the times of interest , we integrate over all degrees of freedom of the heat bath in order to obtain the transition rates .",

    "the critical droplet consists of a single overturned spin , so the @xmath44-fold way algorithm @xcite ( @xmath73@xmath9@xmath74 mcamc ) gives adequate speed - ups .",
    "however , when @xmath68 approaches 2 from below or above , the @xmath73@xmath9@xmath75 mcamc algorithm is needed to prevent the system from fluctuating between the all - spins - up state and the state with all spins up except for one overturned spin . for @xmath76@xmath3@xmath71@xmath3@xmath77 , the critical droplet has an l - shape formed by three overturned spins .",
    "this necessitates using @xmath73@xmath9@xmath78 mcamc to prevent the system from fluctuating between the state with all spins up except for one overturned spin and the state with two overturned nearest neighbor spins .",
