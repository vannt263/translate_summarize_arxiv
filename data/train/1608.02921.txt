    "the study of possible singularity types on complex projective plane curves has a long history .",
    "just to mention a few results , namba in  @xcite classified all projective plane curves up to degree @xmath0 .",
    "flenner and zaidenberg listed the possible local cusp types ( types of locally irreducible singularities ) of tricuspidal curves with @xmath1 in  @xcite and with @xmath2 in  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the degree of the curve and @xmath4 is the maximal multiplicity among the multiplicities of the cusps on the curve .",
    "the work in this direction was continued by fenske , who classified unicuspidal and bicuspidal curves with @xmath1 and @xmath5 in  @xcite . in  @xcite , he discussed the case of @xmath6 under some additional constraints .    in these works , constructing rational cuspidal curves by giving explicit equations and birational transformations of the complex projective plane plays a crucial role .",
    "one method is to start with a conic in @xmath7 and construct a series of birational transformations leading to a series of cuspidal curves .",
    "the birational transformation is usually given by a configuration of divisors ( with given self - intersection numbers ) on a certain complex surface , such that these divisors can be blown down in two different ways to get @xmath7 ( see for example the divisor configurations on figures  [ fig : cremona0 ] , [ fig : cremona1 ] and [ fig : cremona2 ] in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .    in this note",
    ", we would like to give some examples of curve constructions leading to bicuspidal rational complex projective plane curves .",
    "to the best of the knowledge of the author , curves under * ( b ) * and * ( c ) * in theorem  [ thm : main ] are new , others are ( implicitly ) present in @xcite ( see remark  [ rem : notice ] and the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .    in  @xcite , certain embeddings of @xmath8 into @xmath9 are listed .",
    "some of them lead to cuspidal complex projective plane curves having exactly two intersection points with the line at infinity in @xmath7 .",
    "we will be interested only in bicuspidal curves in this note .",
    "although the existence of cusp configurations * ( a1)(a4 ) , ( d1 ) , ( d2 ) , ( e ) , ( f ) * listed in theorem  [ thm : main ] is already proved in @xcite , the advantage of our approach is that on one hand we explicitly state the newton pairs and the multiplicity sequences of the singularities on the curves , on the other hand , we also give birational transformations transforming a conic or a bicuspidal curve with simple equation to these rational bicuspidal curves with given cusp configurations .",
    "this explicit construction is left out from @xcite , although the authors checked that all the given curves are rectifiable , i.e. there is a birational transformation of @xmath7 transforming the curve into a line ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* commentary , p. 306 ) ) .",
    "notice that from our construction , it is clear that curves * ( a1)(a4 ) * are common generalizations of some curves constructed by fenske in @xcite and tono in @xcite ( see remark  [ rem : notice ] ) .      after an overview of some relevant invariants of embedded local topological types of complex plane curve singularities and basic facts about blow - ups and birational transformations in section  [ sec : notation ] , we give the main theorem  a list of some existing cusp configurations of bicuspidal curves  in section  [ sec : construction ] , together with the proof by explicit construction of these curves with the given cusp configurations .",
    "the author would like to thank andrs nmethi for useful discussions , the construction of series * ( b ) * and the equations of the initial curves in the construction of series * ( a1)(a4 ) * in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
