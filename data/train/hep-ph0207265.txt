    "it was predicted long ago @xcite that at large @xmath5 and large @xmath6 the angular distribution of pions from the reaction @xmath7 should be described by means of perturbative qcd as due to the exchange of t - channel ( u - channel ) quarks .",
    "this reaction is commonly consider as a gold - plated reaction for pqcd effects to be observed .    in order to have both @xmath5 and @xmath6 large , large entrance photon - photon energies @xmath8",
    "are required .",
    "actually up to now there is no common consensus how large @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) should be so that pqcd behaviour of the angular distributions could be observed . at present",
    "the reaction can be studied by means of bremsstrahlung of two photons at @xmath9 colliders only .",
    "this method is efficient only low @xmath8 which can be easily understood in the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) .",
    "furthermore the pqcd predicts a strong decrease in the cross section with increasing photon - photon energy @xmath8 .",
    "thus it becomes clear that the bremsstrahlung method can be efficiently used only for not too high @xmath8 energies .    in the leading - twist perturbative treatment ,",
    "the transition amplitude factorizes into a hard scattering amplitude and pion distribution amplitude .",
    "the pion distribution amplitude was found to be strongly constrained by the photon - pion transition form factor @xcite .",
    "for the `` realistic '' distribution amplitude the pqcd contribution to the @xmath0 @xcite is well below the experimental data above the resonance region ( 2 gev @xmath10 3.5 gev ) @xcite .",
    "recent analyses of the delphi and aleph collaborations at lep2 @xcite extend the energy range .",
    "in contrast to previous measurements it was possible to separate @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels in the recent analyses .",
    "the preliminary data confirm the missing strength problem .",
    "thus it becomes clear that the leading - twist pqcd approach is not sufficient to describe the experimental data and the mechanism must be of nonperturbative origin . in a recent work",
    "@xcite it was proposed that the amplitude for @xmath0 to be described as a hard @xmath13 amplitude times a form factor describing the soft ( not calculable ) transition from @xmath14 to the meson pair .",
    "it was assumed implicitly in this approach that all the strength comes from the so - called hand - bag process !    in the present study we take slightly different approach in an atempt to establish to what extend the present data can be understood in terms of relatively well known soft hadronic physics and what is the role of final state interaction ( fsi ) effects not yet discussed in the literature . at energies below @xmath15 resonance the fsi effects are known to be rather weak @xcite and the cross section is dominated by one - pion exchange . above the @xmath15 resonance the fsi effects have never been studied .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that in the pion - pion elastic scattering at @xmath16 2 gev the multipole soft rescattering may play an important role up to very large momenta transferred , i.e. it shifts the onset of the pqcd behaviour to larger @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "inspired by the result of @xcite , in the present note we discuss the role of the final state interaction effects in @xmath0 .",
    "we shall show that at not too high energies , i.e. where experiments were performed , the coupling between the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 channels may play quite important role .",
    "it is well known that at large momentum transfers the exclusive processes , such as @xmath0 , test quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is not known , however , how big the momentum transfer should be in order that the rules of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) could be applied .    according to the rules proposed in @xcite , at large energies and large center - of - mass angles , i.e. at large four - momentum transfers , the amplitude for the @xmath0 can be factorized into a perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitude and a non - perturbative distribution amplitude of finding a valence quark in each pion @xmath19 the indieces @xmath20 and @xmath21 are photon helicities . in general the distribution amplitudes @xmath22 undergo a slow logarithmic qcd evolution , depending on scales @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the collinear approach @xmath25 is computed assuming that the quarks ( antiquarks ) are collinear with outgoing mesons . because in the present analysis we concentrate mainly on pion exchange and fsi effects , we shall limit the approximatiom for @xmath25 to the leading order ( lo ) in @xmath26 only . in practice",
    "the distribution amplitudes can not be calculated from first principles . based on phenomenology of a few reactions",
    ", it seems at present that the distribution amplitude should be rather close to the asymptotic one : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the pion decay constant ( @xmath29 = 130.7 mev ) .    in fig.[fig_pqcd ] we compare the pqcd result obtained for the asymptotic distribution with the experimental data from @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we follow @xcite rather than @xcite and use running coupling constant with simple analytic models for freezing @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "there is a clear excess of the experimental cross section over the pqcd prediction in the whole measured range of photon - photon energies .",
    "what other processes can contribute in this energy range ?",
    "can the pion exchange and/or final state interaction be responsible for the missing strenght ?",
    "we shall try to answer these questions in the following sections .",
    "the pqcd amplitude ( [ pqcd_amplitude ] ) contains singularities at @xmath30 = 0 and @xmath30 = @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) which are artifacts of the collinear approximation .",
    "this is the region of the phase space where the collinear pqcd result is certainly not trustworthy .",
    "furthermore the small angle scattering is probably of soft nonperturbative character due to meson or reggeon exchanges which are included in the present approach explicitly .",
    "therefore in order to avoid double counting and make possible the use of the pqcd amplitudes in the multiple - scattering series , we shall smoothly cut off the small @xmath5 and small @xmath6 regions in the perturbative amplitude .",
    "this is done phenomenologically by introducing a @xmath32 symmetric form factor @xmath33 \\cdot \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{u - u_m}{\\lambda_{reg}^2}\\right ) \\right ] \\ ; \\label{pqcd_regulator}\\ ] ] which the pqcd amplitude ( [ pqcd_amplitude ] ) is multiplied by . here",
    ", @xmath34 and @xmath35 are maximal kinematically allowed values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and @xmath36 is a cut - off parameter to be fixed .",
    "the above choice for the form factor removes the singularities in the original collinear pqcd amplitude .",
    "our model division into soft and hard regions suggests that @xmath36 should be of the order of the cut off parameter in the vertex form factor for soft meson / reggeon exchanges , i.e. of the order of 1 gev",
    ". can be also conveniently used to simulate effects of finite transverse momenta of quarks in the final pions which leads to a suppression of collinear pqcd result up to s@xmath3720 gev@xmath38 @xcite . in order to simulate phenomenologically the results of @xcite",
    "we would need also @xmath39 1 gev . ]    in fig.[fig_pqcd_cut ] we show @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) obtained from the pqcd amplitude ( [ pqcd_amplitude ] ) modified by the form factor ( [ pqcd_regulator ] ) for different values of @xmath36 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 gev , for three different energies w = 2,4,6 gev . in the z - distribution",
    "the soft / hard `` borders '' are clearly energy dependent which can be seen by deviations of the modified pqcd results ( dashed lines ) from the original pqcd results ( solid lines ) . at low energies",
    "dominant mechanism becomes nonperturbative .",
    "when @xmath42 the perturbative component is totally suppressed by @xmath43 0 .",
    "then , only soft processes known from low and intermediate energy physics are at play .",
    "thus in the low energy limit our approach coincides with the succesful low - energy phenomenology by construction . only at high energies one can expect pqcd effects to dominate in the region of intermediate @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the qed born amplitude for the @xmath0 reaction with point - like particles has been known for long time @xcite . at low energies , where chiral perturbation theory is usually applied ,",
    "pions are treated as point - like particles .",
    "the finite - size corrections vanish automatically when @xmath46 0 , i.e. @xmath47 0 as well .",
    "this means that only at sufficiently high energies the finite - size corrections may show up .",
    "an interesting problem is how to generalize the qed amplitude for real finite - size pions . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we follow the idea of poppe @xcite and correct the qed amplitude by an overall @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependent form factor @xmath48 this form by construction guarantees crossing symmetry .",
    "it is natural to expect that finite size corrections should damp the qed amplitude for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 large . at sufficiently high energies",
    "the following simple ansatz fulfils this requirement @xmath49 where f are standard vertex function such that @xmath50 1 and @xmath510 when @xmath52 .. ] the ansatz ( [ ff_ansatz ] ) has a nice feature that in the limit of large @xmath53 @xmath54 i.e. it generates standard vertex form factors .",
    "then at @xmath55 0 ( large @xmath53 ) , @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 for the monopole vertex form factor this leads to a suppression @xmath58 of the qed result for point - like particles .",
    "thus the pion exchange gives a faster decrease of the cross section with energy than the pqcd mechanisms , and at sufficiently high energy it can be neglected .",
    "an interesting question is : at what energy does this difference become significant .",
    "the correct small and large angle behaviour ( [ ff_in_limits ] ) allows us to use traditional ( @xmath5- or @xmath6-dependent only ) vertex form factors .",
    "we note , however , that the exact form of @xmath59 is not known , particularly in the region of interest , i.e. at large @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in order to have some flexibility",
    "when discussing the effect of the poorly known large t / u region we choose a simple but rather flexible form for the vertex form factors @xmath60 from the analysis in @xcite we expect @xmath61 4 gev@xmath62 for the elementary vertex . in order to see the sensitivity to the particular functional form of @xmath59",
    "we shall also replace @xmath59 s by the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath63 , assuming the standard monopole form with the @xmath64 meson mass .",
    "can be interpreted as half off - shell electromagnetic form factor @xmath65 of the pion , with only one pion in the vertex being off its mass shell . ]    in order to complete our discussion and quantify the finite size effects we show the result obtained for one - pion exchange model with @xmath66 in fig.[fig_pqcd ] ( dotted line ) .",
    "it is surprising that the so - obtained finite - size - corrected pion exchange is comparable with the pqcd result ( dashed lines ) up to relatively large energies .",
    "if both amplitudes are of comparable size one has to include interference effects .",
    "the size of the interference effects can be estimated by comparing the incoherent sum of pqcd process and soft pion exchange @xmath67 and the coherent sum @xmath68 ( see the thick solid line in fig.[fig_pqcd ] and the third column in table 1 ) .",
    "the interference effects are generally large and positive .",
    "the coherent sum @xmath69 only weakly depends on the functional form of the form factor used .",
    "the details depend , however , on the vertex form factor . in the case of the monopole ( em )",
    "form factor the effect of the interference effects survives up to large energies @xmath70 5 gev when the pion - exchange contribution alone becomes much smaller than the perturbative contribution . in the case of the exponential form factor ( @xmath71 = 3 gev@xmath62 )",
    "the interference effects become negligible for @xmath70 4 gev .    as can be seen from the figure the interference of the pqcd and pion - exchange amplitudes improves considerably the agreement with the recent delphi @xcite and aleph @xcite data .",
    "this automatically implies that there is less room is left for the hand - bag mechanism contribution considered in @xcite .",
    "the effect of interference of the pion - exchange and pqcd contributions on the angular distribution is shown in fig.[fig_pqcd_pion ] .",
    "the constructive interference can be observed over the whole angular range .",
    "the @xmath15 resonance is known to be strongly populated in the @xmath72 collisions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is rather broad with @xmath73 0.2 gev .",
    "the leading twist pqcd contribution drops strongly with energy .",
    "therefore one should look at the interplay of the high energy flank of @xmath15 with the strongly decreasing continuum . then all kinds of energy dependence of kinematical and dynamical origin must be included . in the relativistic approach ,",
    "the total cross section for the resonance contribution reads @xmath74 one usually parametrizes @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a function of dynamical origin usually obtained in a simple nuclear physics inspired model of resonances @xcite .",
    "the analysis of angular distributions has shown @xcite that @xmath15 is produced dominantly in the helicity @xmath78 2 state , in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "this means that the angular distribution of pions in the @xmath15 frame of reference factorizes as @xmath79 this formula can be used to calculate the resonance contribution in a limited range of @xmath80 , as it is usually done in experiments .    in fig.[fig_f2 ]",
    "we show the resonance contribution obtained from ( [ resonance ] ) and ( [ gamma_tot ] ) with other parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "this contribution competes with both pqcd and pion contribution up to very large energies .",
    "it would be naive to expect , however , that the energy dependence of ( [ gamma_tot ] ) can be used far from the resonance region . for comparison ,",
    "we also show ( dashed line ) the result obtained with the relativistic breit - wigner formula ( [ resonance ] ) but with an energy - independent width @xmath81 . the result with energy independent width describes slightly better the high energy flank of @xmath15 for the @xmath11 channel .    in the vicinity of the @xmath15 peak one may also expect interference of the resonance amplitude and the continua due to pion exchange and pqcd mechanisms . because a consistent overall microscopic model of the resonance and the continua is not available , the relative phase between the resonance amplitude and that for the pion exchange is not known . in the following we take a pragmatic attitude and try to fit the phase to the markii data @xcite . in order to explain the low energy flank of the @xmath15 resonance we need @xmath82 .",
    "we shall make the simplest approximation and assume that this phase is energy independent . adding all contributions together we obtain results represented by the thick solid and thick dashed lines for energy - dependent and energy - independent widths in the resonance amplitude , respectively . in this way we obtain a result almost consistent with the preliminary delphi @xcite and aleph @xcite data at least up to w = 2.5 gev .",
    "the agreement with the data may be extended even further towards higher photon - photon energies , but it is not clear if the adopted simple approximations are reasonable that far from the resonance position .",
    "all this demonstrates that the situation just above the @xmath15 resonance is far from being under control .",
    "therefore expecting the pqcd quark exchange mechanism to be the only reaction mechanism in this region seems to us rather unjustified .",
    "up to now we have included only pion exchange born amplitude .",
    "it was demonstrated recently that for elastic pion - pion scattering , soft fsi effects lead to a damping of the cross section at small angles and a considerable enhancement in the region of intermediate angles where they compete with the two - gluon exchange amplitude .",
    "let us explore the role of fsi effects for the reaction under consideration .",
    "the fsi effects are an intrinsic part of fundamental scattering theory",
    ". therefore there should be good reasons for fsi to not occur .",
    "calculations of fsi effects at intermediate energy is not always an easy task . in the following",

    "we shall discuss the interference pattern and the sign of some selected interference terms .      as already discussed",
    "there are two single exchange mechanisms leading directly to the @xmath11 channel : soft pion exchange ( @xmath90 ) and pqcd hard quark exchange ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "while the first can be reliably calculated at small @xmath5 or small @xmath6 , the second is trustworthy only at @xmath5 and @xmath6 both large .",
    "going beyond the region of their applicability requires extrapolations which can not be derived from first principles and leads to obvious uncertainties .",
    "in particular , as discussed in the previous sections , it is not completely clear what is the contribution of pion exchange in the measured angular distributions for -0.6 @xmath92 0.6 . in this section",

    "we have thoroughly studied the role of different mechanisms which could potentially cloud the pqcd contribution :      it was found that the soft pion exchange , which is known to be the dominant mechanism below the @xmath15 resonance , stays important also above the resonance .",
    "more subtle details are however difficult to predict as the half - off shell electromagnetic form factor of the pion is rather poorly known both experimentally and theoretically . in addition the pion - exchange amplitude strongly interferes with the pqcd amplitude .    because the pqcd contribution strongly decreases with the photon - photon energy the high energy flank of the broad @xmath15 resonance gives a contribution of comparable size to the pqcd continuum in a rather broad energy range above the resonance .",
    "using phenomenological , yet realistic , pion - pion interaction found in a recent analysis we have estimated the contribution of the final state interaction processes .",
    "we have found that pion - pion fsi as well as the coupling with the @xmath17 channel modify the total amplitude at the level of 10 - 20 % .    in our model",
    "we predict : @xmath142 .",
    "the leading mechansims for the @xmath4 being @xmath15 resonance and fsi rescattering effects , including coupling with the @xmath17 channel .",
    "this result differs from the recent predictions of diehl , kroll and vogt @xcite who obtained : @xmath143 .",
    "we hope that experimental verification of both scenarios will be possible in near future . in our opinion",
    "the effects discussed in the present paper must be taken into account in order to extract empirically the hand - bag contribution .",
    "this may not be an easy task , however , as the different contributions can interfere .",
    "good data for both @xmath11 and @xmath132 channels , including angular distributions , also at @xmath144 0.6 , would be very helpful to disentangle the complicated dynamics in the region of intermediate energies .    in the light of our analysis",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 reaction is not the best choice to identify the pqcd predictions .",
    "we plan a similar analysis for other meson pair production in @xmath72 collisions in order to find the best candidate to study perturbative qcd",
