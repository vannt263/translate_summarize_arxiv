    "we mention , for instance , applications in image analysis ( e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) , in medicine ( e.g. , in studying tumor growth @xcite ) , and in material science in phase - transition models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the parallel set of @xmath0 at distance @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 ; it is introduced as a probabilistic version of the derivative at 0 of the volume function @xmath29 , and so , whenever the limit exists , as a possible approximation of what we denote by @xmath23 , the mean boundary density of @xmath0 .",
    "the problem of the existence of @xmath24 is left as an open problem in  @xcite ( apart from particular cases as stationary random closed sets ) .",
    "more recently , in @xcite the problem of the approximation of the mean density @xmath21 of lower dimensional non - stationary random closed sets is faced under quite general regularity assumptions on the rectifiability of @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , an approximation of @xmath21 in weak form is proved in  @xcite , theorem  4 ; namely @xmath30 the possibility of exchanging limit and integral in the above expression when @xmath15 is not stationary with @xmath31 , was left as open problem in @xcite , remark 8 .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to address such open problems for more general random closed sets . indeed , even if boolean models are widely studied in stochastic geometry ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , it is clear that they can not be taken as model for many real situations in applications .",
    "thus , we revisit here some results in @xcite , addressing the two mentioned open problems ; we provide sufficient conditions on lower dimensional random sets @xmath15 so that @xmath33 and so that the specific area @xmath24 defined as limit in ( [ specific ] ) exists , in the case of random sets @xmath0 with non - negligible @xmath20-measure . such results might allow to face a wider class of possible applications ; indeed , for instance , the statistical estimator @xmath34 of the mean density @xmath35 , introduced in @xcite and which we recall here in corollary [ corstimatore ] , can now be applied to very general lower dimensional random sets @xmath15 , not only in stationary settings or to boolean models , and so also to non - stationary germ - grains model whose grains are not assumed to be independent .",
