    "the dynamical billiards , as a class of dynamical systems , were introduced by birkhoff @xcite in his study of lagrangian systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "a lagrangian system with two degrees of freedom is isomorphic with the motion of a mass particle moving on a surface rotating uniformly about a fixed axis and carrying a fixed conservative field of force with it .",
    "if the surface is not rotating and the force vanishes , then the particle moves along geodesics on the surface . if the surface has boundary , then the resulting system is a billiard system .",
    "dynamical billiards on curved surfaces is related to the study of quantum magnetic confinement of non - planar 2d electron gases ( 2deg ) in semiconductors @xcite , where the effect of varying the curvature of the surface corresponds to a change in the potential energy of the system .",
    "the dynamical billiards can be viewed as a mathematical model for this system , and may be used to investigate the electron transport properties of the semiconductors . as mentioned in @xcite , the advances in semiconductor fabrication techniques allow to manufacture solid state ( mesoscopic ) devices where electrons are confined to curved surfaces .",

    "note that @xmath834 for each @xmath835 .",
    "we claim that @xmath836 is a submersion at each point in @xmath837 .",
    "the verification of the submersion is pretty simple for convex billiards : by pushing the point @xmath804 along the normal direction of @xmath838 ( for @xmath800 , while fixing all other @xmath839 , @xmath840 ) , we see that @xmath841 changes linearly ( since @xmath829 is fixed ) ; by rotating the tangent direction @xmath842 of @xmath839 along @xmath843 , ( while fixing all @xmath839 ) , we see that @xmath844 changes linearly ( since @xmath845 is a fixed nonzero vector ) ; and all these variations are independent .    therefore , the map @xmath836 is a submersion at each point in @xmath837 .",
    "so the codimension of @xmath822 in @xmath846 is at least @xmath847 , which is larger than @xmath848 .",

    "this completes the proof for nonsymmetric periodic orbits .    for symmetric periodic orbits ,",
    "the proof is almost the same .",
    "the only difference is that when @xmath853 , and the collision from @xmath804 to @xmath803 is at the right angle . in this case",
    ", we still have that @xmath841 changes linearly by pushing @xmath804 along the normal direction of @xmath838 ( since @xmath829 is fixed ) .",
    "then the rest of the proof is the same .",
    "putting together these results , we get that , for a residual subset of convex tables , each periodic orbits with period @xmath65 has zero defect .",
    "this completes the proof that genericity of zero defect .",
    "for the second part of proposition [ zero ] , we note that in the proof given above , we used the property that each folding of the path at @xmath854 is a reflection ; but we did nt use any property that @xmath764 is on a single orbit . in particular",
    ", one can take the union of the two periodic orbits and then study the paths with that joint pattern .",
    "therefore the same analysis applies to the case that two orbits have some common reflection point .",
    "then we conclude that , there is a residual subset of convex tables , for which any two periodic orbits with no common geodesic segment has no common reflection point .",
    "however , note that the orbit obtained by the time - reversal of one orbit has exact the same geodesic segments , and this does not count as positive defects .",
