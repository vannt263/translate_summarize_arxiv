    "more than seven years ago we began an investigation of the optical light curve of the crab pulsar .",
    "we tentatively identified a peak in fourier spectra of the light curve at a frequency @xmath0hz ( ade & galii  @xcite a ,  @xcite b ,  @xcite c ) .",
    "later observations slightly enhanced the signal to noise ratio of the suggested peak .",
    "we suspected that it was the signature of free precession of the pulsar and thus in  @xcite proposed a simple model .",
    "we tested it by predicting the free precession frequency of the earth and showed that it also reproduces well the measured ellipticities of the planets ( ade et al @xcite ) .",
    "the former test was based on the argument that the relative rigidity of the pulsar is at least as strong as that of the earth .",
    "this allowed us to apply the same model to calculate the free precession frequency of pulsars .",
    "we found that the observed @xmath1hz frequency is consistent with a @xmath2m@xmath3 pulsar model based on the tensor interaction equation of state .",
    "as a further check we proposed to measure the slow - down rate of free precession . in the past years we gathered more data , building a set of more than 3.400 images , which cover more than 20 hours of photometry spanning a period of almost nine years .",
    "it is appropriate to confront these data with the proposed test .",
    ".list of data sets giving the _ name _ of the run ( as used in later references ) , the name of the _ telescope _ , the _ date _ of observation , the _ sampling rate _ ( the exposure time to obtain the sample is generally shorter than the sampling rate ) and the total _ duration _ of the run . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our photometry was done in the stroboscopic mode .",
    "this type of photometry was introduced previously ( ade & galii @xcite ) in order to increase the signal to noise ratio of measured pulsed emission from pulsars .",
    "the method is based on the fact that the arrival time and duration of pulses can be calculated quite precisely .",
    "thus we introduced the stroboscope - a phase controlled shutter ( rotating wheel ) , which passes light to the ccd detector only during the time intervals when the pulsar ( main pulse ) is `` on '' .",
    "therefore , images obtained behind this shutter receive all light emitted by the pulsar , but the much brighter emission from the surrounding nebula , is reduced by the ratio of the expected main pulse duration to the pulse period ( set to 0.1 by our stroboscope ) . in our case",
    "this noise reduction ratio is about a factor of 2 . in stroboscopic",
    "photometry the timing is crucial , so we spent a considerable effort checking it .",
    "the whole stroboscopic setup together with the ccd has been periodically tested at the hewlett - packard calibration laboratory in ljubljana , where an artificial pulsar has been pulsed by a cesium clock  ( galii @xcite ) .",
    "all tests confirmed that the stroboscopic wheel correctly follows the frequency and phase of the input signal we had some timing problems which were traced to a software bug in calculating the proper date , so that the calculated barycentric frequency set on the timer was slightly off , resulting in slow phase slippage of the stroboscope with respect to the pulsar .",
    "the slippage was slow enough that we could calculate its effect and correct for it . ] .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    photometric data were taken with four different telescopes and exposure times between 4 and 15 seconds and sampling rates beween 4.0 and 26.7 seconds .",
    "the data are of a somewhat varying quality depending on the telescope and on respective observing conditions . in table 1",
    "we list the dates , telescopes , durations of observation and sampling rates of all runs .",
    "the abbreviations hst ( percival et al .",
    "@xcite ) ce , as and gh stand for hubble space telescope , the 1.82 m telescope of the asiago observatory , the 1.22 m telescope of the asiago observatory and the 2.12 m telescope of the guillermo haro observatory respectively .    in fig . 1 and 2 we show the light curves of a field star , which is used for calibration and the contemporeneous light curves of the crab pulsar",
    "the photometry was done by using iraf / daophot and previously daophot routines .",
    "in order to search for a possible common modulation frequency in all crab light curves , we construct a matrix with components @xmath4 , which are fourier transforms of cross - correlation functions between light curves , i.e. : @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the fourier transform of the @xmath7 light curve : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the magnitude as measured from the @xmath10 image of the k@xmath11 light curve taken at time @xmath12 ( with respect to the beginning of the @xmath7 set ) and @xmath13 is the total duration of the k@xmath11 set of measurements .",
    "@xmath6 is considered as a continuous function defined first at discrete frequencies @xmath14 , where s is an integer belonging to the interval @xmath15 , and then extended so that @xmath16 on the interval @xmath17 .",
    "we first test statistical properties of the @xmath18 components on light curves of the field star , i.e. we test the hypothesis that all noise in the light curve is white gaussian noise .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then ( for each @xmath19 ) @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) may be considered as a realization of a random process @xmath22 distributed according to : @xmath23 and @xmath24 belongs to a random process @xmath25 distributed according to @xmath26 where and , since noise is considered as white , all @xmath27 belong to the same random process .",
    "] @xmath28 is the spectral density of noise in measuring the magnitude , @xmath29 is the modified bessel function ( galii @xcite ) and @xmath30 indicates the average over frequencies ( higher than 0.005hz to exclude the 1/f noise at the low end ) . in order to detect a periodic component in the light curve we construct two quantities and @xmath31 as weighted averages , where the weight of each component @xmath4 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average of @xmath34 corresponding to the @xmath35(@xmath7 ) light curve . ] : @xmath36 and @xmath37 which in case of white gaussian noise average to : @xmath38 and : @xmath39    [ fig : fig3 ]    in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 calculated from the 12 light curves of the field star as plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath43 if @xmath44 and @xmath45 if @xmath46 .",
    "the average @xmath47 = 0.00091@xmath48 and @xmath49 = 0.00054@xmath48 .",
    "thus , from eq.[povpm ] we deduce @xmath50 and eq.[sigmam ] gives @xmath51 .",
    "both numbers are consistent with each other and with average dispersion estimates from iraf ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the test star data conform with the statistical assumptions described above .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]    the result of a similar analysis for 16 crab light curves is shown in fig .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath53 is almost the same for the crab and the test star ; however the average @xmath54 for the crab is 1.5 times that of the test star .",
    "the process @xmath55 can , therefore , not be considered as white gaussian noise , but it can be understood by assuming that it is the sum of a stationary `` signal '' @xmath56 and white gaussian noise @xmath57 with the same spectral density as that of the test star .",
    "we considered the possibility that the `` signal '' is connected to a spurious phase modulation in stroboscope timing , but lab tests have set the upper limit for such a modulation some 100 times lower  ( galii @xcite ) . we therefore conclude that the crab pulsar light curve is intrinsically intensity modulated at the level of about 0.03@xmath58 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of this modulation measure is presently too low to reveal more about its nature .    to test for the slow down of the purported free precession we recalibrate frequencies in @xmath6 to the same date according to an assumed power law dependence of the free precession frequency with time ,",
    "i.e. we introduce the recalibrated frequency @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the rotation frequencies of the pulsar at the reference date ( jan.1.1996 ) and at the date when the k@xmath11 light curve was obtained .",
    "the above analysis has been repeated for different powers @xmath62 between 0 and 4 .",
    "a 5.3 @xmath63 peak stands out in @xmath64 and is found at @xmath65 for @xmath62 around 1 , as shown in fig.5 and 6 .",
    "note that in the free precession model @xmath62 is expected to be 1 if the time for the pulsar to relax its internal stress is much longer than the total observation period ( @xmath66years ) .",
    "it is expected to be 3 , if this relaxation time is considerably shorter .",
    "short relaxation times would point to externally driven precession .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]    [ fig : fig6 ]",
    "the question whether pulsars free precess was raised soon after pulsars were identified as rotating neutron stars . however , more than twenty years later most astronomers would agree with trimble and mcfadden s ( @xcite ) somewhat humorous reference to our paper suggesting that earth is the only known free precessing body in the universe .",
    "we believe that pulsar free precession has evaded detection and/or identification for two main reasons .",
    "1 ) most researchers assume that neutron star matter is in a complex superfluid state , which provides an excuse to evade the question : what is the inertial eccentricity of a rotating neutron star ? as a result , the range of predicted or `` identified '' free precession frequencies in the literature is almost without bounds , although pines and shaham ( @xcite ) estimated that the crab pulsar would wobble with a period @xmath67 5 minutes if it had a solid core .",
    "2 ) as alpar and gelman ( @xcite ) correctly point out , free precession is a motion characteristic of rigid rotators . in a plastic rotator ,",
    "free precessing motion is damped out by viscous losses - in pulsars this should happen on a time scale of years or thousands of years .",
    "therefore , unless pulsars are exposed to reasonably large external torques , they are not expected to free precess . in our earlier paper ( @xcite )",
    "we tried a naive approach : starting with the observation that the earth free precesses but taking into account the possibility that it may not be quite rigid with respect to free precession .",
    "we analysed the relation between the earth s inertial eccentricity , free precession frequency , rotation frequency and obliquity .",
    "we found that the earth s shape and that of other planets is quite similar to the equilibrium shape of rotating polytropes with no shear stress .",
    "the earth s free precession frequency can be fairly accurately calculated on the basis of these assumptions .",
    "we argue that a pulsar s crust is relatively more rigid and thick than the earth s .",
    "therefore , argument for planets can also be used to calculate a pulsar s free precession frequency . for the fast crab pulsar we found a free precession frequency on the order of @xmath68 and in particular the theoretical value @xmath69",
    "was found for a @xmath2m@xmath3 pulsar model based on the tensor interaction equation of state .",
    "surprisingly , the 35 day period of herx-1 fits the same formula almost exactly `` where @xmath70 is the non - hydrostatic ellipticity '' . ] .",
    "our much larger dataset for the crab pulsar strenghtens evidence for the 60 seconds period and also suggests that this period is increasing with time at almost the same rate as the rotation frequency of the pulsar .",
    "we also found that different combinations of smaller data sets consistently produce a peak at @xmath71 ( of course with a correspondingly smaller signal to noise ratio ) . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the fourier amplitude of the signal in the expected frequency channel ( assuming the frequency power law with @xmath72 ) as a function of time together with errorbars ( calculated from 10 neighbouring amplitudes ) .",
    "single data points are clearly very noisy , therefore , not much can be said about the time dependence - in particular the glitch of july 1996 ( jodrell bank crab pulsar monthly ephemeris @xcite ) did not leave a clear mark .",
    "the best linear fit to our data points gives an amplitude of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is expressed in years since 1996.0 .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ]    does the pulsar free - precess",
    "? we presented all the evidence that we have and are inclined to believe that it does point to an affirmative answer .",
    "open questions remain such as : 1 ) does the amplitude of the free precession really change with time ? and 2 ) on what time scale",
    "does the pulsar relax its internal stress ?",
    "observation of pulsar free precession can teach us much about pulsar physics . as shown by ade , galii and calvani @xcite",
    ", the free precession model can quite sensitively ( if something is known about the state of internal stress ) distinguish between different neutron matter equations of state .",
    "observing the change in free precession amplitude and frequency can allow one to learn about external torques on the pulsar ( jets may produce them ) and also about exchange of angular momentum between the crust and the neutron superfluid .",
    "many questions regarding the @xmath75 period remain open and , given the relevance of those questions to our understanding of pulsar physics and their interaction with neighbouring plasma , it would be important if other research groups could extend our analysis and observations .",
    "we are grateful to many people who made these observations possible and who kept our sometimes dwindling spirits up .",
    "the padua observatory is among our staunchest supporters - in particular massimo calvani was supporting and stimulating our observations from the very beginning , ulisse munari granted us one of his nights at the 1.82 m telescope and prof .",
    "roberto barbon was very helpful during our 1997 observations .",
    "we thank boris hrib for his help in the hp calibration lab and jurij kotar , dick manchester and david nice for help with the tempo program .",
