    "in the initial stage of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions energetic partons are produced from hard collisions between the partons of the nuclei . receiving a large transverse momentum",
    ", these partons will propagate through the fireball which might consist of a quark - gluon phase for a transitional period of a few fm/@xmath4 .",
    "these high - energy partons will manifest themselves as jets leaving the fireball .",
    "owing to the interaction of the hard partons with the fireball these partons will lose energy .",
    "hence jet quenching will result .",
    "the amount of quenching might depend on the state of matter of the fireball , i.e. , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) or a hot hadron gas , respectively .",
    "therefore jet quenching has been proposed as a possible signature for the qgp formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , first results from @xmath5 at rhic have shown a suppression of high-@xmath6 hadron spectra spectra @xcite which could possibly indicate the quenching of light quark and gluon jets  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the data  @xcite from light ion interactions @xmath7 at rhic indicate no evidence of suppression in high @xmath6 hadron spectra implying the absence of jet quenching as there is no formation of extended dense medium in the final state in such light ion interactions .",
    "however , this information from the light ion interactions in turn lends a strong circumstantial support that the observed suppression in @xmath5 is due to the final state energy loss of jets in the dense qgp matter .",
    "hadrons containing heavy quarks are important probes of strongly interacting matter produced in heavy ion collisions and has also excited a considerable interest .",
    "heavy quark pairs are usually produced at early on a time scale of @xmath8fm / c from the initial fusion of partons ( mostly from @xmath9 , but also from @xmath10 ) and also from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , if the initial temperature is high enough .",
    "there is no production at late times in the qgp and none in the hadronic matter .",
    "thus , the total number of charm quarks get frozen very early in the history of collision which make them a good candidate for a probe of qgp , as one is then left with the task of determining the @xmath6 distribution , whose details may reflect the developments in the plasma .",
    "the momenta distribution of @xmath4 quarks are likely to be reflected in the corresponding quantities in @xmath11 mesons as the @xmath4 quarks should pick up a light quark , which are in great abundance and hadronize .",
    "the first phenix data  @xcite from rhic in @xmath5 collisions at @xmath12agev on prompt single electron production are now available , which gives an opportunity to have an experimental estimate of the @xmath6 distribution of the heavy quarks . within the admittedly large experimental error",
    "the data indicate the absence of a qcd medium effects .",
    "we hope that the future experimental study will provide data with improved statistics and wider @xmath6 range , which could then help us to understand the effect of medium modifications of the heavy quarks spectra .    in order to see the effect of medium modifications on the final states , the energy loss of hard partons in the qgp has to be determined .",
    "there are two contributions to the energy loss of a parton in the qgp : one is caused by elastic collisions among the partons in the qgp and the other by radiation of the decelerated color charge , _",
    "i.e. _ , bremsstrahlung of gluons .",
    "the energy loss rates due to collisional scatterings among partons were estimated extensively  @xcite in the literature . using the hard - thermal - loop ( htl )",
    "resummed perturbative qcd at finite temperature @xcite , the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark could be derived in a systematic way  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown  @xcite that the drag force can be related to the elastic scatterings among partons in a formulation based on the fokker planck equation which is equivalent to the treatment of htl approximations  @xcite . from these results also an estimate for the collisional energy loss of energetic gluons and light quarks could be derived @xcite , which was rederived later using the leontovich relation @xcite .",
    "the energy loss due to multiple gluon radiation ( bremsstrahlung ) was estimated and shown to be the dominant process . for a review on the radiative energy loss see ref .",
    "recently , it has also been shown  @xcite that for a moderate value of the parton energy there is a net reduction in the parton energy loss induced by multiple scattering due to a partial cancellation between stimulated emission and thermal absorption .",
    "this can cause a reduction of the light hadrons quenching factor as was first anticipated in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the most of the earlier studies insisted that the collisional energy loss is insufficient to describe the medium modification of hadronic spectra .",
    "these studies , however , were limited to the case of massless energetic quarks and gluons .",
    "the first estimate of heavy quark radiative energy loss was found to dominate  @xcite the average energy loss rate and subsequently the charmed hadron  @xcite and the dilepton  @xcite spectra had a strong dependence on the heavy quark radiative energy loss .",
    "most recent studies of the medium modifications of the charm quark spectrum have computed by emphasizing only the energy loss of heavy quarks by gluon bremsstrahlung  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the appearance of kinematical dead cone effect due to the finite mass of the heavy quarks leads to a large reduction in radiative energy loss and affects significantly the estimation of the quenching of charm quarks and @xmath2 ratio . also in refs .",
    "@xcite a surprising degree of reduction in radiative energy loss for heavy quarks was obtained by taking into account the opacity expansion with and without the ter - mikayelian ( tm ) effect . in the framework in which all these calculations have been performed",
    "the heavy quarks are possibly not ultra - relativistic ( @xmath13 )  @xcite for much of the measured momentum range and in this case it is far from clear that radiative energy loss dominates over collisional case .",

    "on the other hand , heavy quarks medium induced radiative energy loss  @xcite to all orders in opacity expansion , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the length of the plasma , @xmath27 is the mean free path of the gluon ) , has been derived by generalizing the massless case  @xcite to heavy quarks with mass in a qcd plasma with a gluon dispersion characterized by an asymptotic plasmon mass .",
    "this also provides the estimate of the influence of a plasma frequency cut - off on a gluon radiation ( ter - mikayelian effect ) and thus shields the collinear singularities ( @xmath28 ) those arise due to massless quarks .",

    "we also here estimate the light hadron quenching ( for details see ref .",

    "as shown the @xmath2 ratio is enhanced significantly as compared to @xmath201 collisions .",
    "the enhancement factor varies from @xmath202 to @xmath203 in the @xmath6 range ( 5 - 10 ) gev/@xmath4 , due to the uncertainties of different choices of parameter set to parameterize the heavy hadron spectra as depicted in ( [ hparam ] ) .",
    "however , the ratio also strongly depends on the quenching of light quark jets .",
    "the numerical estimate shows that the quenching of charm quarks is about a half that of light quarks .",
    "the light quarks , for a given @xmath6 , lose 10@xmath175 of their energy after traversing a distance 1 fm and around 40@xmath175 after 5 fm  @xcite whereas the charm quark loses @xmath204 at 1 fm and around 20@xmath175 at 5 fm ( fig .",
    "[ fig_eloss_evo ] ) . because of the large mass of the charm quark the @xmath11 meson will be formed in shorter distance and hence charm quark",
    "would have less time to propagate in the medium before transforming into the @xmath11 meson . on the other hand",
    ", the light quarks would travel in the medium over a longer period and suffer more loss in energy than heavy quarks .",
    "the ratio is also found to be little more than that obtained earlier  @xcite considering only the radiative energy loss with the appearance of the kinematical dead cone effect due to the finite heavy quark mass .",
    "this implies that the collision is one of the most dominant mechanisms of energy loss in the medium .    as shown that both collisional and radiative energy losses are of same order in magnitude it would be interesting to predict the @xmath2 ratio within our model considering radiative energy loss in addition to collisional one . since neither the drag and diffusion coefficients have been calculated for other than collisional processes",
    ", it is not possible to infer the impact of radiative processes directly within our model . in order to circumvent our lack of knowledge of radiative processes in terms of the transport coefficients ,",
    "we consider an alternative sets  @xcite within our model , obtained by multiplying the transport coefficients by a factor @xmath205 .",
    "it is our hope that the experimental data will allow us to fix an approximate value of @xmath206 , if at all required . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] , we plot the @xmath2 ratio for such a case with the same parameter set as before .",
    "as shown the ratio is little reduced compared to the collisional case and it varies from 2 to 3 within the @xmath6 range , ( 5 - 10 ) gev/@xmath4 .",
    "there is no striking change in the ratio mostly due to the cancellation of the introduced @xmath206 factor with reference to the collisional one for respective species .",
    "however , the small change can be attributed as the charm quark with the inclusion of radiative energy loss is relatively more quenched than that of the light quarks .    one may also add an interesting scenario , after the quark jet has hadronized to leading particles , they would scatter with hadronic matter before decoupling . considering @xmath207 , _ e.g. _ , it is most likely that the heavy mesons would decouple quickly from the hadronic phase .",
    "pions would interact with each other via resonance formation and also with other light hadrons .",
    "this might lead to further enhancement of @xmath2 ratio .",
    "apart from uncertainties in the various parameters describing the plasma and hadron spectra let us also have a look at some of the assumptions made in this work which may affect our findings .",
    "first , as discussed above , the momentum dependence of the drag and diffusion coefficients , containing the dynamics of the elastic collisions , has been averaged out .",
    "a major advantage of this is the simplicity of the resulting differential equation .",
    "of course , this simplification can lead to some amount of uncertainty in the quenching factor .",
    "secondly , the entire discussion is based on the one dimensional fokker - planck equation and the bjorken model of the nuclear collision , which may not be a very realistic description here but can provide a useful information of the problem .",
    "however , extension to three dimension is indeed an ambitious goal , which may cause that many of the considerations of the present work will have to be revised .    in the present calculation",
    "the hadron spectra for both light and heavy quarks have directly been used to calculate the quenching factor , @xmath52 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that a quark forms a hadron without much change in its energy . in order to calculate the effects of the parton energy loss on the quenching pattern of high @xmath6 partons in nuclear collisions",
    ", one should take into account the modification of the fragmentation function  @xcite of a leading quark resulting from many soft interactions of the hard partons in the medium .",
    "this also causes a significant energy loss of parton prior to hadronization and changes the kinematic variables of the fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "this can also modify the quenching factor and thus @xmath2 ratio .",
    "we show that the total collisional energy loss is almost same order as that of radiative energy loss for a static plasma .",
    "considering the collisional energy loss rates we obtain a momentum loss distribution for charm quarks by solving the time evolution of fokker - plank equation for a thermally evolving plasma . the total energy loss for an expanding plasma is found to be reduced by a factor of 5 as compared to static case and does not depend linearly on the system size .",
    "a ratio of heavy to light hadrons @xmath2 ratio is also estimated .",
    "though the collisions have different spectrum than radiation and therefore contribute in a similar way to the suppression factor than anticipated earlier .",
    "we now eagerly wait for the experimental data and a detailed calculation have to be carried out before a realistic number for the value of the @xmath2 ratio can be presented .",
    "nevertheless , the total collisional energy loss of a charm quark computed within our simplified model may imply that the collision is one of the important energy loss mechanisms in the medium for the energy range ( 5 - 10 ) gev and this feature may be phenomenologically important . also , the results for @xmath2 presented within this model is not definitive but can provide a very intuitive picture of the medium energy loss for partons in moderately large @xmath6 .",
