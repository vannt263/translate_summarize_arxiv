    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) constitute a short - lived ( @xmath210@xmath3 yr ) phase in the life of intermediate mass ( @xmath118 m@xmath4 ) stars @xcite .",
    "the majority of central stars of pne ( cspne ) have hydrogen - rich atmospheres @xcite .",
    "there does exist , however , another class of central stars with h - deficient atmospheres . some h - deficient cspne have strong emission lines of highly ionised carbon , oxygen and helium , and exhibit fast stellar winds and high mass - loss rates ( up to 10@xmath5 m@xmath4 per year ) compared to other cspne .",
    "these stars are known as wolf - rayet ( denoted [ wr ] ; @xcite ) central stars ( see crowther 2008 for a summary of historical classification systems ) .",
    "quantitative classification schemes currently in use for [ wr ] subtypes are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ wr ] stars are often erroneously referred to as ` population ii ' wrs to differentiate them from their massive ` population i ' counterparts .",
    "( while most [ wr]s are population ii objects , some are found within type i pne , which would indicate the cs to be population i. ) wind terminal velocities of up to 3000 km s@xmath6 have been measured in some cases , although late - type [ wr]s have much smaller values , sometimes as low as @xmath1200 km s@xmath6 in [ wc10 ] and [ wc11]s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there also exists a class of weak emission - line central stars ( wels ; see  [ i d ] ) , which exhibit emission lines at the same wavelengths as wolf - rayet types , but at weaker intensities . unlike [ wr]s , wels do not necessarily have h - deficient atmospheres , though many do ( hajduk , zijlstra & gesicki 2010 ) .",
    "because of their similar spectra , our search for wolf - rayet type central stars in the mash database has resulted in the concomitant discovery of a number of wels , which are detailed along with the new wolf - rayet cspne .    while there are nearly 3000 true , likely and possible galactic pne currently known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , relatively few central stars have been spectroscopically classified .",
    "for example , in the strasbourg - eso catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae @xcite , out of 1143 pne , only 224 central stars ( @xmath120 per cent ) were assigned spectral types .",
    "more recently , @xcite have tabulated central star spectroscopic information for only 13 per cent of the enlarged galactic pn sample .",
    "[ wr ] cspne are thought to represent between 5 and 7 per cent of all central stars @xcite , but this may be a lower limit , based on a range of selection effects .",
    "for example , when long - slit spectra are obtained for an object , the slit is often positioned over the brightest portion of the pn , missing the central star entirely . for these reasons previously compiled samples may suffer from selection biases and the exact frequency of wolf - rayet type central stars could be higher than what has been suggested in the recent literature .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find that [ wr ] pne are probably the brightest pne in h@xmath7 in a given sample , so in those samples where the faintest pne are excluded , there exists the possibility of an overestimation of the frequency of [ wr ] stars .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of non - da ( hydrogen - deficient ) white dwarfs in a local sample is approximately 40 per cent @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that the observed proportion of h - deficient central stars , including [ wr]s and their progeny ( e.g. pg 1159 stars ; werner & herwig 2006 ) , the presumed progenitors of these non - da white dwarfs , has been previously underestimated",
    ".    observing cspne can be difficult .",
    "many are faint in the optical , as distance and interstellar reddening renders their observation problematic .",
    "because classification of [ wr]s depends on measurement of sometimes faint optical lines , reddening will often hide the evidence of emission - line central stars unless deep , high s / n spectra are obtained .",
    "[ wr ] central stars are thought to result from a final late or very late helium shell thermal pulse after the star has left the agb phase , which leads to the ingestion or ejection of the remaining thin hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "this is effectively the same scenario used in the explanation of h - deficient ejecta inside otherwise normal pne ( e.g. a 30 and a 78 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also called the ` born - again ' scenario @xcite .",
    "arguments against the ` born - again ' scenario can be found in @xcite , where the authors find a disparity between model surface brightness predictions and observed values .",
    "the ` born - again ' scenario has also been questioned because the abundances of ` born - again ' ejecta in a 30 and a 58 have been found to be oxygen- instead of carbon - rich , with an overwhelming amount of neon , more akin to the abundances of neon in nova ejecta @xcite .",
    "alternative theories have been proposed for the evolutionary sequence of [ wr ] stars , among them a binary interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently found that the first close binary [ wr ] cspn and suggested that the close binary fraction in the [ wr ] class may be much lower than for their h - rich counterparts .",
    "our incomplete understanding of [ wr ] evolution is due in part to the dearth of objects in this class which may be examined .",
    "hence , any new additions to the list of known [ wr]s are important in constructing a rigorous sample for statistical analysis . @xcite and @xcite show that very early - type ( [ wo1]-[wo4 ] ) and late - type ( [ wc8]-[wc11 ] ) stars dominate [ wr ] cspne in the galaxy , in contrast to the magellanic clouds , which seem to possess primarily intermediate types between [ wc4 ] and [ wc8 ] @xcite .",
    "recent work has revealed that the galactic bulge [ wr]s seem to be heavily weighted towards late spectral subtypes @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the bulge [ wr ] subtype distribution is similar to massive wc stars , which seem to increase in number as the subtype number increases @xcite .    with a larger sample , it will be possible to put more precise limits on the frequency of [ wr]s exhibiting specific subclasses and explore the differences in type distribution between environments of differing metallicity and age . in addition , a greater variation of parameters such as metallicity , temperature , terminal velocity and chemical abundances can be useful in theoretical work which attempts to place constraints on the conditions necessary for h - deficient stellar evolution . in the future ,",
    "separate samples for the galactic disk ( intermediate age , metal - rich ) and bulge ( old , metal - rich ) , as well as the magellanic clouds ( intermediate age , metal poor ) may enable us to more precisely lay out the age and metallicity constraints required for the specific subclasses to be produced .",
    "the number of known galactic [ wr ] cspne has steadily increased from the late 1960s , when such nuclei were first discovered and classified @xcite . by the mid-1990s",
    ", the count had reached 56 @xcite .",
    "discoveries over the past ten years , including our work , have nearly doubled this number to approximately 105 .",
    "@xcite summarised the state of the field early in the decade , listing 86 objects designated to be a [ wr ] or a [ wr ] candidate .",
    "the macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath0 ( mash ) surveys of pne @xcite presented @xmath1900 and @xmath1300 new pne respectively.360 pn candidates .",
    "] in all , the mash survey increased the number of known galactic pne by nearly 80 per cent . out of the mash catalogues , 24 [ wr ] stars or [ wr ] candidates have been identified .",
    "only seven of these [ wr]s have been previously published in detail , in three previous papers .",
    "morgan et al . ( 2001 ; paper i ) , detailed the first two discoveries , while another four [ wr ] central stars were presented by @xcite ( 2003 ; paper ii ) . a paper on the purported [ wn ] pm  5 ( see  [ i d ] ) quickly followed ( * ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) .",
    "this paper represents the fourth in our series concerning new [ wr ] discoveries , where we describe our additional discoveries in detail and present their spectra .",
    "many of them were listed in brief notes in the online mash catalogues accompanying parker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and miszalski et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "note that the preliminary discovery spectrum for mpa1611 - 4356 was shown by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2008a ) with others noted in the catalogue and referred to generally ( but not explicitly ) in miszalski , acker & parker ( 2008b ) .",
    "four of the objects noted here have been independently identified as [ wr]s by @xcite and @xcite , but our observations and identification predate these publications .",
    "we note the respective references in the specific subsections devoted to each object .",
    "spectroscopic observations of most objects were carried out at the siding spring observatory on the anglo - australian telescope , the 2.3 m telescope , and the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "other data were taken at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) using the 1.9 m telescope and at the european southern observatory s very large telescope during the eso visitor mode programme 0.79.d-0764(a ) .",
    "all spectra were bias and flat - field subtracted and dereddened , and in some cases strong nebular lines from the surrounding pn were also subtracted .",
    "those objects with signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) of 10 or greater were rectified .",
    "the instrument and observation details concerning the discovery spectra are listed in table [ obsinfo ] . for long slit observations",
    ", the slit width was set at 2  .",
    "fibres on aat 2df observations are 2.1  wide .",
    "observations on 6df on the ukst used 6.7  fibres .",
    "as discussed in section 1.1 , the majority of the [ wr ] central stars presented here were identified in the course of spectroscopically confirming mash pn candidates when the fibre or slit fell across the cspn .",
    "in addition , 10 previously known pne were serendipitously discovered to possess [ wr ] cspn in the course of general mash follow - up observations with the aa@xmath8 spectrograph @xcite on the anglo - australian telescope and the 6df spectrograph @xcite on the ukst .",
    "the object of observing missions with these wide - field multi - object spectrographs was to confirm as many mash pne as efficiently as possible .",
    "these multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) instruments possess 400 and 150 fibres over a two degree and a six degree field respectively .",
    "this enables us to place individual fibres not just on the primary mash candidate objects but also on all other known pne that are present in the field .",
    "subsequently , during the long exposure times required to obtain sufficient snr in observations of the faint mash pne , the faint [ wr ] features of some central stars of previously known pne also emerged . for a description of the aa@xmath8 observations ,",
