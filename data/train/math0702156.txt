    "<S> 0.3 cm we prove that in three space dimensions a nonlinear wave equation @xmath0 with @xmath1 being an odd integer has a countable family of regular spherically symmetric self - similar solutions .      </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of many nonlinear wave equations is that their solutions , corresponding to smooth initial data , may form singularities after a finite time . </S>",
    "<S> such a phenomenon , usually referred to as blowup , has been a subject of intensive studies beginning with the pioneering works by keller @xcite , john @xcite and glassey @xcite ( we refer an interested reader to the excellent online review of this subject with the complete bibliography @xcite ) .    in this paper we consider the semilinear wave equation with a power nonlinearity @xmath2 where @xmath1 is an odd integer . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the nonlinear term corresponds to focusing which means that it tends to magnify the amplitude of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath3 is small this term is negligible and the evolution is essentially linear leading to dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath3 is large the dispersive effect of the laplacian may be overcome by the focusing effect of the nonlinearity and a singularity can form . </S>",
    "<S> actually , neglecting the laplacian altogether and solving the ordinary differential equation @xmath4 one gets the exact , homogeneous in space , solution @xmath5^{\\frac{1}{p-1 } } , \\quad      \\alpha=\\frac{2}{p-1},\\quad t>0,\\ ] ] which blows up as @xmath6 . by the finite speed of propagation </S>",
    "<S> one can truncate this solution in space to get a solution with compactly supported initial data which blows up in finite time . </S>",
    "<S> there is theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite evidence that the solution @xmath7 determines the leading order asymptotics of blowup for generic large initial data . </S>",
    "<S> however , for specially prepared initial data , in particular for data fine - tuned to the threshold for blowup , singularities may have a different form which is given by self - similar solutions of equation ( [ deq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such solutions were found numerically in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to give a rigorous proof of their existence and discuss their properties .    by definition , self - similar solutions </S>",
    "<S> are invariant under rescaling @xmath8 hence in the spherically symmetric case they have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> note that each self - similar solution , if it is regular for @xmath11 , provides an explicit example of regular initial data developing a singularity in a finite time . substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into equation ( [ deq ] ) we obtain the ordinary differential equation for the similarity profile @xmath12 @xmath13 it is easy to see that this equation has the constant solution @xmath14 which , of course , corresponds to the homogeneous solution @xmath7 of equation ( [ deq ] ) . as mentioned above , </S>",
    "<S> numerical results indicate that , besides @xmath15 , there exist also nontrivial regular solutions of equation ( [ sseq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that equation ( [ sseq ] ) has been studied by kavian and weissler @xcite who made many interesting observations about the behavior of solutions but unfortunately they imposed very restrictive fall - off conditions at infinity which excluded nontrivial solutions . </S>",
    "<S> however , as long as one wants to have an example of blowup , due to the finite speed of propagation , only the behavior of solutions inside the past light cone of the blowup point @xmath16 is relevant , which corresponds to the interval @xmath17 . as we shall see below regular self - similar solutions </S>",
    "<S> are parametrized by their values at the endpoints @xmath18 and @xmath19 . due to the singular nature of equation ( [ sseq ] ) at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , </S>",
    "<S> the generic solution obeying the regularity condition at @xmath20 becomes singular at @xmath21 and vice versa , hence globally regular solutions can exist only for discrete values of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to show that there exists an infinite sequence of pairs @xmath24 which give rise to globally regular solutions . to this end , in section  2 we first prove existence of local solutions near the endpoints . then , in section  3 , we show , using a shooting argument , that for a discrete set of values of the parameters these local solutions match smoothly at a midpoint . in section  4 </S>",
    "<S> we show that the solutions constructed in section  3 can be extended beyond the past light cone to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section  5 we derive some scaling properties of the shooting parameters . in the appendix we present an alternative rigorous proof of existence .      in the first step </S>",
    "<S> we will analyze the behavior of solutions near the boundary points @xmath20 and @xmath21 and prove the local existence of one - parameter families of regular solutions there .    near @xmath20 we introduce a new variable @xmath25 and rewrite equation ( [ sseq ] ) as the first order system    @xmath26    this system has the form required by proposition  1 of @xcite guaranteeing the existence of a one - parameter family of regular solutions near @xmath20 such that @xmath27 similarly , near @xmath21 we put @xmath28 to get    @xmath29    in order to bring this into the form required by proposition  1 of @xcite we introduce @xmath30 and rewrite the system ( 8) as    @xmath31    where the function @xmath32 is analytic in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 near @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> these solutions are analytic as functions of @xmath22 , @xmath49 and @xmath45 in a neighborhood of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the general solution is in fact regular at @xmath21 as a function of @xmath50 with a convergent taylor series at @xmath46 .      </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is : 0.2 cm * theorem  1 . * for any odd @xmath1 and any non - negative integer @xmath51 , equation ( [ sseq ] ) on the interval @xmath52 has an analytic solution @xmath53 which satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ local0 ] ) and ( [ local1 ] ) , and for which the function @xmath54 , with @xmath55 defined by ( [ uinf ] ) , has exactly @xmath56 zeros . 0.2 cm _ remark : _ in this section we give a `` physicist '' proof ( no epsilon - delta stuff ) based on scaling arguments . </S>",

    "<S> this is conveniently proven using a suitable lyapunov function @xcite defined as @xmath58 obeying @xmath59 hence , for solutions regular at @xmath20 we get @xmath60 which implies @xmath61 and @xmath62 furthermore , @xmath63 and thus @xmath12 has a finite limit at @xmath21 .    on the other hand , for solutions regular at @xmath21 we may integrate the function @xmath64 to the left . </S>",

    "<S> we get @xmath107 keeping @xmath108 fixed and letting @xmath72 ( and with it @xmath109 ) we find that @xmath105 spirals down ( in the negative direction ) to the limit point @xmath110 having that it is easy to show existence of regular solutions for large @xmath23 . integrating the solutions regular at @xmath21 back to @xmath111 we obtain a smooth curve @xmath112 parametrized by @xmath22 . for @xmath113 </S>",
    "<S> this curve goes from the point @xmath114 to @xmath115 passing through @xmath116 for @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the curve @xmath105 intersects the curve @xmath112 again and again as @xmath23 goes to infinity ( note that the curve @xmath112 has positive rotation around @xmath116 ) . </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath12 is a solution to equation ( [ sadjoint ] ) that is analytic at @xmath21 and @xmath177 , then @xmath12 is defined for all @xmath176 and @xmath178 . </S>",
    "<S> 0.1 cm _ proof : _ integrating equation ( [ sadjoint ] ) from @xmath159 to some @xmath176 we get @xmath179 hence if @xmath67 is bounded , so is @xmath39 and therefore the solution can not become singular . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it suffices to show that @xmath180 . from equation ( [ sadjoint ] ) we have that @xmath181 and @xmath178 for @xmath176 implies that @xmath182 , thus @xmath67 is monotone decreasing . to show that @xmath67 can not become negative we introduce the function @xmath183 . evaluating @xmath184 at @xmath185 we obtain @xmath186 which , together with @xmath187 , implies that @xmath188 for @xmath176 . </S>",

    "<S> we find that @xmath193 satisfies the equation @xmath195 with the boundary condition at @xmath21 @xmath196 for any @xmath197 and @xmath22 sufficiently close to @xmath198 , the solution of equation ( [ weq ] ) satisfying the initial condition ( [ weg_bc ] ) will stay arbitrarily close to @xmath199 on the interval @xmath200 , hence it can be approximated by @xmath201 , where @xmath202 satisfies the linearized equation @xmath203 with the boundary condition @xmath204 . </S>",
    "<S> we could express @xmath202 in terms of a hypergeometric function but for our purposes it is sufficient to have its asymptotics for small values of @xmath172 @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are constants . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the solution regular at @xmath21 with @xmath22 near @xmath198 has the following form for small @xmath172 @xmath208 the key point is that the regions of validity of the approximations ( [ uas ] ) and ( [ ccurve ] ) overlap so we can match them . matching the amplitudes of solutions ( [ ccurve ] ) and ( [ uas ] ) at @xmath111 we get the condition @xmath209 on the other hand , using ( [ ccurve ] ) and the fact that the phases of two adjacent solutions @xmath210 and @xmath211 differ by @xmath212 we obtain @xmath213 hence @xmath214 which , using ( [ amatch ] ) , implies that @xmath215 the numerical verification of these scaling properties is shown in table  1 in the case @xmath118 .    </S>",
