    "while the standard model ( sm ) is successful in explaining most , but not all , of the present experimental data , it suffers from theoretical inconsistencies . outstanding amongst these are the two hierarchy problems : the discrepancy between the planck and the electroweak scale , and the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "thus it is generally expected that new physics around the tev scale is needed to stabilize the higgs mass and solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "originally , warped extra dimensional models were introduced to explain the first discrepancy @xcite . in the original scenario ,",
    "two branes are introduced , one with an energy scale set at the planck scale , the other at the tev scale , with the standard model ( sm ) fields localized on the tev brane , and with gravity allowed to propagate in the bulk . the exponential warp factor arising from the ads geometry accounts for the seemingly unnatural difference between the planck and the electroweak scales .",
    "allowing sm fermions and gauge fields to propagate in the bulk @xcite can also explain the fermion mass hierarchy by fermion localization @xcite .",
    "one shortcoming of this minimal model is that the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the bulk have masses compatible with the compactification scale , and tight bounds from precision electroweak tests @xcite and from flavor physics @xcite constrain them to be in the few tev range , an obstacle in producing and observing these resonances at the lhc .",
    "the tests of the model would then likely come from observing other particles , in particular , the radion , which is a scalar field associated with fluctuations in the size of the extra dimension , and playing a role in its stabilization . in a simple model with a bulk scalar which generates a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the radion field emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson associated with the breaking of translation symmetry @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that the mass of the radion does not depend on the compactification scale but only on the mechanism that stabilizes the size of the extra dimension . as the radion couples more or less through the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , its coupling to particles is proportional to their mass , in a similar fashion to the higgs boson .",
    "in fact , as they share same quantum numbers , the radion field can mix with the higgs boson after electroweak symmetry breaking , which involves another parameter , the coefficient of the curvature - scalar term @xcite . generically",
    ", the radion may be the lightest new state in a randall - sundrum type setup , with a mass typically suppressed with respect to kk fields by a volume factor of @xmath7 @xcite , which then might put its mass between a few tens to hundreds of gev , with suppressed couplings which allow it to have escaped detection at lep , and consistent with precision electroweak data .",
    "the interest in scalar particles beyond the sm has been fueled by the recent atlas and cms searches .",
    "although clear evidence for a new state is at present inconclusive , there are exclusion regions reported by atlas @xcite : @xmath8 gev @xmath9 gev , @xmath10 gev @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 gev @xmath13 gev at 95 % confidence level ( cl ) , while the mass region excluded by cms @xcite is @xmath14 gev @xmath15 gev at 95% cl . in the mean time",
    ", both experiments observed an intriguing excess of events for a possible higgs boson with mass close to @xmath16 gev for atlas and @xmath17 gev for cms .",
    "the three most sensitive channels in this mass range , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 contribute to the excess with significances of 3.1@xmath20 , 2.1@xmath20 and 1.4@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "if this would be confirmed by further data analyses in 2012 , a higgs boson of mass around 125 gev may be indicative of physics beyond the sm due to the vacuum instability @xcite .",
    "furthermore the observed @xmath21 excess in the @xmath22 channel observed by atlas is higher than the expected signals of the pure sm higgs boson ( with the same mass ) , which again points to new physics .",
    "as the window for new physics opens , one can naturally ask if the new state is a higgs , a radion , or a higgs - radion mixed state .",
    "this possibility could have even more dramatic consequences for the scenario with an additional generation of fermions , which is a natural extension of the warped space model as in @xcite .",
    "re - examination of electroweak ( ew ) precision data showed that a fourth generation of fermions is not ruled out experimentally .",
    "additionally , an extra generation was shown to have theoretically attractive features , and could help address some of the fundamental open questions , such as baryon asymmetry of the universe , higgs naturalness , fermion mass hierarchy , and dark matter ( see @xcite and for a recent review , @xcite and references therein ) . however , at present four generations phenomenology may not be in such a good shape .",
    "there are increasing indications from cms and atlas that the fourth generation quarks would be very heavy @xcite , though all the tests have assumptions which may or may not hold . in any case ,",
    "based basically on the enhancement of the higgs production rate via @xmath23 in four generations ( by a factor of @xmath24 ) , the ensuing enhancement of the decay @xmath25 , and the suppression of @xmath26 the higgs boson is excluded in the mass range @xmath27 gev at 95% , and in the range @xmath28 gev at 99% c.l .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it appears that if the bump in the signal at cms and lhc is the higgs boson , this would rule out the sm4 at 95% confidence level for @xmath29 gev , and at 99.6% if @xmath30 gev @xcite .",
    "the limits from the tevatron @xcite also exclude a wide range of higgs boson masses .    in a recent study",
    ", we have shown that if the fourth generation is incorporated into the framework of warped space models , both the production and decay patterns of the higgs bosons can be altered significantly with respect to the patterns expected in the standard model with four generations , thus giving rise to distinguishing signals at the colliders @xcite .",
    "radion phenomenology with and without higgs - radion mixing has been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a tree - level misalignment between the flavor structure of the yukawa couplings of the radion and the fermion mass matrix will appear when the fermion bulk parameters are not all degenerate in both three @xcite and four generations @xcite . in this last reference",
    "it was also pointed out that the radion is less sensitive to the presence of an extra generation than the higgs boson .",
    "as the mechanism responsible for the radion flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) is different from the one for the higgs in these same models @xcite , and the branching ratios for decays into gluons and photons for three and four generations also differs , we can expect the phenomenology of the higgs - radion mixed state to present an interesting interplay of the two mechanisms responsible , and to yield different effects .",
    "in particular , this mixing may help evade the apparent constraints on low higgs masses in the four generation scenario . motivated by these expectations , we study the phenomenology of the higgs - radion mixed state , paying particular attention to the signals for @xmath31 as well as @xmath32 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand for the mixed higgs - radion states .",
    "we use the presently - available atlas @xcite and cms data @xcite for scalar searches to identify regions in the parameter space where the data is compatible with one or the other of these states .",
    "similar analysis with the mixing effects in three generations has been most recently studied in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : themodel ] ) , we briefly review the warped model with fermions in the bulk .",
    "we then discuss the production and decays of the higgs - radion mixed states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : prod - decays ] ) and discuss regions of the parameter space where the events at the lhc would be compatible with observing a mixed state .",
    "for the allowed parameter space , we present the flavor - changing and flavor - violating decays of the two higgs - radion states in sec . [",
    "sec : fcnc ] .",
    "we analyze cases in which the fourth generation of leptons is @xmath33 gev , or light ( @xmath34 gev ) , as this mass has implication of branching ratios .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the ads metric including the scalar perturbation @xmath35 is given in the rs coordinate system by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the radion graviscalar is the scalar component of the 5d gravitational perturbations and tracks fluctuations of the size of the extra - dimension ( i.e. its `` radius '' ) .",
    "the perturbed metric is no longer conformally flat , and in linear order in the fluctuation @xmath35 , the metric perturbation is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the 5d radion field .",
    "the radion acquires mass through a stabilization mechanism with the addition of a bulk scalar field with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which , after taking into account the back - reaction of the geometry due to the scalar field vev profile  @xcite , leads to an effective potential for the radion .",
    "we assume that this back - reaction is small , and does not have a large effect on the 5d profile of the radion .",
    "the relation between the canonically normalized 4d radion field @xmath40 and the metric perturbation @xmath39 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radion interaction scale .",

    "since the radion and the higgs bosons have the same quantum numbers , it is possible for them to mix via kinetic factors : s_=d^4x r(g_vis)h^ , with @xmath65 the ricci scalar .",

    "the factor @xmath190 is the color factor , for quarks @xmath191 , and for leptonic decays , @xmath192 .",
    "the flavor violating couplings of the mixed states are defined as @xmath193 where the couplings @xmath194 and @xmath195 , of the original unmixed higgs and radion , have been previously obtained in @xcite in the case of three generations and in @xcite with four generations . in the branching ratio calculations given in the tables",
    ", we use the central values for @xmath194s and @xmath195s obtained in the numerical scans performed in the last references , and we choose a specific allowed value of @xmath73 for each point studied in the parameter space .",
    "we first present the branching ratios to fcnc decays for allowed parameter points from the previous section .",
    "we chose two different scenarios .",
    "in one @xmath147 gev , thus a scalar of mass @xmath122 gev can have flavor - violating decays into @xmath175 .",
    "these results are shown in table i. the fcnc decay branching ratios into @xmath175 can reach 5% .",
    "overall , the effect is not measurable , however , should the mass of the @xmath140 be close to its experimental limit @xmath196 gev , the situation could change drastically and the @xmath197 can reach 50 % , suppressing all other decays .",

    "in this work , we have investigated the phenomenology of the higgs - radion mixed state with a fourth generation of quarks and leptons , in an attempt to explain the latest lhc data .",
    "we asked the question : if the scalar particle seen at the lhc is not the ordinary sm higgs boson , but a mixed higgs - radion state , could this state satisfy all the experimental constraints , even including the effects of a fourth generation ?",
    "the four generation assumption in warped space models is of particular interest , as the standard model with four generations , sm4 , fails to reproduce the observed data to at least 95% confidence level .",
    "a fourth generation , which is severely restricted and perhaps even ruled out by the atlas and cms data in sm4 could be resuscitated in warped space models .",
    "the answer to the question we posed is a cautious yes . that is , there exist regions of the parameter space where one of the mixed higgs - radion states has mass of @xmath122 gev , and satisfies existing experimental constraints , while the other either has a mass of @xmath125 gev , thus fitting a cms parameter point , or evades present collider bounds .    summarizing the allowed parameter space ,",
    "if the @xmath1 state is the scalar observed at the lhc , the @xmath0 mass must be light .",
    "parameter points with either @xmath158 gev , which evade lep restrictions , or @xmath134 gev , which fit the cms data , are allowed for some range of the mixing parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we analyzed these for both very light fourth generation charged leptons , @xmath147 gev , or for heavier ones , @xmath148 gev .",
    "the difference between these two masses is that the first case allows flavor - changing decays of the higgs - radion state , which are large in this model and which modify the branching ratios to @xmath22 and @xmath110 .",
    "all of these parameter points require the scale @xmath43 to be light , in the @xmath201 tev range , the exact values dependent on the rest of the parameters . for larger @xmath118 values ,",
    "the branching ratio to @xmath111 increases beyond the lhc limits , and thus this parameter region is forbidden .",
    "this region of parameter space is very fragile . for @xmath132 gev",
    ", the point at @xmath202 gev shows signs of instability as the @xmath203 excess might be cancelled by @xmath22 , while its decay into @xmath204 appears to have increased .",
    "the signal for @xmath158 gev , while not ruled out by lep data depends very sensitively on the values of @xmath146 and @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath0 is the scalar observed at the lhc , the @xmath1 state is most likely to be heavy .",
    "the exception is when @xmath147 gev ; for @xmath139 gev parameter points exist for @xmath205 and @xmath206 tev .",
    "regions where @xmath207 and @xmath181 gev exist for some values of @xmath43 , which is still required to be in the @xmath208 tev range .",
    "these parameter regions seem quite robust and not dependent on whether @xmath140 is heavy or light ; however they could be ruled out within the next year at lhc as data for heavier scalars becomes available . to increase predictability of our scenario ,",
    "we calculated the branching ratios of the allowed higgs - radion states into fermions , both for flavor changing and flavor conserving channels ( some of which are significantly enhanced with respect to the sm expectations ) . as more data on the scalar production and decay becomes available ,",
    "these predictions can be compared with the experiment , specially noting the appearance of the interesting exotic fcnc decays .    in conclusion , we have achieved two goals in this work : first , we have shown that a scalar in a warped model with a fourth generation of fermions can be light _ and _",
    "consistent with the lhc data , if the observed particle is a higgs - radion mixed state .",
    "second , the allowed parameter space is tightly constrained and expected to be confirmed or ruled out within a year by further analyses and/or higher luminosity at the lhc .",
