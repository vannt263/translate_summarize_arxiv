    "ippp/07/64 + dcpt/07/128 + cern - ph - th/2006 - 183    the use of monte carlo event generators is an essential part of all experimental analyses , both in interpreting data from existing experiments and in the design and planning of future experiments .",
    "the crucial role that monte carlo simulations play in experimental studies mean it is imperative these simulations are as accurate as possible .",
    "while the existing monte carlo event generators have been highly successful over the last twenty years , a new generation of programs is necessary for the lhc .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold : a number of new ideas to improve the accuracy of the simulations have been suggested , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , and the existing code structures required major redesign to allow new theoretical developments to be incorporated and to make long - term maintenance easier .",
    "given the changing nature of computing in high energy physics , the natural choice is to write these new programs in c++ . in preparation for the lhc",
    "a major effort is therefore underway to produce new versions of established simulations  @xcite , as well as completely new event generators  @xcite in c++ .    as part of the process of writing the new  event generator",
    "@xcite we wish to improve many aspects of the simulation process .",
    "one area where major improvements are needed is in the simulation of tau lepton decays .    in  the @xmath0",
    "decays were treated in the same way as the decays of the hadrons .",
    "the weak @xmath1 matrix element was used for the leptonic decays , and the other decays were generated using a phase - space distribution for the decay products .",
    "in addition , there were two interfaces to the specialised @xcite package for @xmath0 decays .",
    "the first interface  @xcite , which was part of , was capable of generating longitudinal correlations in @xmath0 decays for all taus produced in the perturbative part of the event , while the second external interface  @xcite was capable of generating the longitudinal spin correlations of taus produced in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays and the full correlation effects in neutral higgs decays .",
    "in  we wanted to :    1 .",
    "include the matrix elements for @xmath0 decay as an integral part of the simulation , in order to both have a unified treatment of all decays and to remove the inherent problems in interfacing to external packages .",
    "2 .   include the absent transverse spin correlations for all @xmath0 decays ; 3 .",
    "make it easy to change parameters in the hadronic currents used in the tau decays and the modelling of individual decay modes .    in this paper we will describe the simulation of @xmath0 decays in .",
    "the aim of the simulation is to give a good description of tau decays with all the experimentally observed decay modes with branching ratio above the 5  per  mille level included together with a reasonable model of the kinematics of the decay .",
    "where possible we have used models which have been compared with , or tuned to , experimental data . in all cases the parameters of the models",
    "can be easily adjusted so that they can be tuned to new experimental data as it becomes available .",
    "first we describe the factorization of the matrix element for @xmath0 decays and the structure of the code .",
    "this is followed by a description of the different models of the hadronic current which are used for the decay modes , together with comparisons with previous results .",
    "we then discuss our choice of models for the various @xmath0 decay modes .",
    "one major advantage of the new structure is that the hadronic currents can be used for applications other than @xmath0 decays which we illustrate by considering the weak decay of charginos to neutralinos in anomaly - mediated - susy breaking  ( amsb ) models , where there is a small mass difference between the neutralino and chargino .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "the matrix element for the decay of the @xmath0 lepton can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum of the @xmath0 and @xmath7 is the momentum of the neutrino produced in the decay .",
    "the information on the decay products of the virtual w boson is contained in the hadronic current , @xmath8 .",
    "this factorization allows us to implement the leptonic current @xmath9 for the decaying tau and the hadronic current separately and then combine them to calculate the @xmath0 decay matrix element .",
    "in  the most important part of the simulation of hadronic decays is handled by the  class .",
    "this class is responsible for :    1 .   generating the kinematics of the decay products ; 2 .   inserting the spin - unaveraged matrix element used to perform the decay and the wavefunctions for the decay products into the  structure .",
    "all of the @xmath0 decays are handled by the class .",
    "this class inherits from the class .",
    "the includes a sophisticated multi - channel integrator to perform the phase - space integration of the decay modes , leaving the implementation of the matrix element calculation and definition of the resonance structure of a multi - body decay mode the only tasks which need to be performed when implementing a new decay model .",
    "the hadronic currents for a large range of modes are implemented as described in section  [ sect : weakcurrent ] .",
    "the classes implementing these currents all inherit from .",
    "the combines the hadronic current with its internal calculation of the leptonic current to compute the matrix element , and generates the momenta of the decay products using the features of its parent class for the generation of the phase space .    given the spin - unaveraged matrix elements , the algorithm described in  @xcite is used in  to include spin correlation effects in all stages of the event generation process .",
    "the  structure , in particular the class , is responsible for passing the correct information between the  objects in order to generate the spin correlations .",

    "<S> we describe the simulation of tau decays in the  event generator , which includes sophisticated modelling of the hadronic currents and full treatment of spin correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the simulation makes it easy to add new models of tau decay , change the parameters of the existing models , and use the models from tau decay for the decay of other particles . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared in detail with an existing simulation , and the benefits of the new structure are illustrated by considering the decay in anomaly - mediated susy - breaking  ( amsb ) models .    </S>",
