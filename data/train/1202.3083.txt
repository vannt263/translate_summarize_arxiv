    "an intrinsic regular hypersurface @xmath8 is locally defined as the non critical level set of an horizontal differentiable function , more precisely there exists locally a continuous function @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and the intrinsic gradient @xmath11 exists in the sense of distributions and it is continuous and non - vanishing on @xmath12 .",

    "let us point out that an intrinsic regular graph can be very irregular from the euclidean point of view : indeed , there are examples of intrinsic regular graphs in @xmath23 which are fractal sets in the euclidean sense ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of our work is to characterize intrinsic lipschitz graphs in terms of the intrinsic distributional gradient .",

    "indeed , for instance , it was proved in @xcite that the notion of rectifiable set in terms of an intrinsic regular hypersurfaces is equivalent to the one in terms of intrinsic lipschitz graphs .",

    "we stress that this is indeed different from proving a rademacher theorem , which is more related to a pointwise rather than distributional characterization for the derivative , see @xcite .",

    "the proof follows a previous argument by dafermos ( see lemma [ l : daflipschitz ] ) . by a construction based on the classical existence theory of odes with continuous coefficients",
    ", we can then define a change of variable @xmath76 which straightens characteristics .",
    "this change of variables does not enjoy @xmath77 or lipschitz regularity , it fails injectivity in an essential way , though it is continuous and we impose an important monotonicity property .",
    "this monotonicity , relying on the fact that we basically work in dimension @xmath78 , is the regularity property which allows us the change of variables .",
    "as we exemplify below , we indeed have an approach different from providing a regular lagrangian flow of ambrosio - di perna - lions s theory , and it is essentially two dimensional . after the change of variables , the pde is , roughly , linear , and we indeed find a family of odes for @xmath2 on the family of characteristics composing @xmath79 , with coefficients which now are not anymore continuous , but which are however bounded . by generalizing a lemma on odes already present in  @xcite , we prove the @xmath42-hlder continuity of @xmath16 on the vertical direction ( @xmath80 constant ) , and a posteriori in the whole domain .",
    "this are the main ingredients for establishing that @xmath2 defines indeed a lipschitz graph : given two points , we connect them by a curve made first by a characteristic curve which joins the two vertical lines through the points , then by the remaining vertical segment .",
    "we manage this way to control the variation of @xmath2 between the two points with their graph distance @xmath81 , checking therefore the metric definition of intrinsic lipschitz graphs .",
    "the other implication of theorem  [ t : firsttheorem ] is based on the possibility of suitably approximating an intrinsic lipschitz graph with intrinsic regular graphs .",
