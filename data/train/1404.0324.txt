    "in recent years , ultracold quantum gases have offered the most favorable conditions for exploring universal aspects of few - body physics . due to the experimental ability to control interatomic interactions using feshbach resonances @xcite ,",
    "the universal few - body physics originated by efimov @xcite has become observable and plays an important role in the stability of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "other classes of universal few - body states have also emerged for a variety of unconventional scenarios @xcite , expanding our knowledge of fundamental aspects of few - body systems .",
    "we can further expand our knowledge by considering physics in lower dimensions .",
    "in particular , we will consider three - body systems relevant for two - dimensional ( 2d ) ultracold gases .",
    "originally , few - body studies in reduced dimensions were motivated by the practical computational benefit . in the case of 2d systems , however , this simplification actually introduces qualitatively different physical properties for the system starting at the two - body level @xcite with a strong impact on the physics of few - body systems @xcite .",
    "although the efimov effect does not occur in 2d @xcite , a system of three identical bosons interacting via short - range forces has been shown to support universal states @xcite , and a whole new set of few - body states have now emerged @xcite with the expectation that they will impact several properties of 2d quantum gases . experimentally , however , it is only possible to create a quasi-2d system , and the connection between such universal states and what can actually be observed experimentally is yet to be determined .",
    "although such experimental conditions can lend themselves to novel physics @xcite , the study of 2d few - body systems provides important knowledge for understanding quasi-2d systems by describing their limiting behavior and should , in part , control the low - energy dependence of scattering observables , i.e. , the threshold laws @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we describe the details necessary to implement the adiabatic hyperspherical representation for the three - body problem in 2d .",
    "this approach is general and is thus capable of going beyond the usual zero - range model potential used in most of the recent studies of few - body systems in 2d @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic hyperspherical representation offers a simple and conceptually clear description of scattering processes in terms of effective three - body potentials . here",
    ", we explore various symmetry properties and derive boundary conditions that are suitable for numerical calculations with general interactions . based on our analysis of the long - range behavior of the three - body potentials",
    ", we also derive the threshold laws for the three - body scattering observables for ultracold experiments , namely , three - body recombination , collision - induced dissociation and inelastic atom - diatom collisions .",
    "although different choices of hyperspherical coordinates exist @xcite , the use of hyperspherical `` democratic '' , or smith - whitten , coordinates have proven to be extremely useful for three - atom systems in 3d @xcite . with this coordinate system",
    ", one can conveniently describe all fragmentation channels as well as define the boundary conditions in a manner that is extremely beneficial for numerical implementations .",
    "the motion of three particles in a plane can be described by nearly the same democratic coordinates used in 3d and has been considered at some length by johnson in ref .",
    "this is possible since the first step in defining 3d democratic coordinates is going to the body - frame , which is always a plane for three bodies .",
    "the main difference lies in the description of the euler angles : in 2d , we need only a single angle .",
    "the reduction from three euler angles in 3d to one in 2d has consequences for the parity and permutation symmetry operations ( as we show in app .",
    "[ permutations ] ) that , in turn , change the hyperangular boundary conditions from their 3d form .",
    "the 2d democratic coordinates are defined by first transforming the jacobi vectors @xmath0 in the laboratory frame ( superscript @xmath1 ) to the body frame via rotation by the euler angle @xmath2 : @xmath3 in 3d , eq .",
    "( [ lf ] ) would have @xmath4 and @xmath5 along with two additional euler angles in the first matrix on the right - hand side to make it a full 3d rotation matrix , but the body - frame coordinate matrix would not change  i.e .",
    ", @xmath6 @xcite . in the above equation , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "are `` mass - scaled '' jacobi vectors defined in terms of the individual particle s lab - frame positions @xmath9 and masses @xmath10 as @xmath11 with @xmath12 where the indices ( @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 ) are a cyclic permutation of ( 1,2,3 ) and @xmath16 is the three - body reduced mass .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath16 is arbitrary , but the present choice ensures that the volume element remains independent of mass @xcite .",
    "the hyperangles are defined by the condition that the moment of inertia tensor is diagonal @xcite , which is accomplished by the transformation @xmath17 here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the democratic hyperangles describing the internal motion of the particles , and @xmath22 is the hyperradius giving the overall size of the system .",
    "the hyperspherical coordinates are defined within the ranges @xmath23 besides the single euler angle , the main difference between the 2d and 3d definitions of these coordinates is the range of @xmath20 . in 3d",
    ", @xmath20 only takes on values between 0 and @xmath24 .",
    "the change in going to 2d comes from the fact that there is no euler angle that can change the orientation of the body - frame @xmath25-axis . in 3d ,",
    "the orientation of the @xmath25-axis is determined by @xmath26 and is thus a dynamical quantity . in 2d ,",
    "the @xmath25-axis is fixed .",
    "more precisely , the plane of the particles is fixed and thus contains all configurations of the particles  i.e . , both signs of @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the range of @xmath20 is doubled to correctly reproduce all configurations of the particles .",
    "we will further see in app .",
    "[ permutations ] that @xmath20 is affected by permutations while it is not in 3d @xcite .    with the definitions above , we can now introduce the three - body schrdinger equation in 2d for the rescaled total wave function @xmath27 ( atomic units will be used unless otherwise noted ) @xmath28\\psi(r,\\omega)=e\\psi(r,\\omega),\\label{schreq } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the total energy and @xmath30 denotes the set of all hyperangles . in eq .",

    "the grand angular momentum operator is essentially the same as in 3d save for a few factors of two @xcite and , of course , the euler angles .",
    "although it is not necessary , we typically assume the interactions to be a pairwise sum of the form @xmath34 where the interparticle distances @xmath35 are given in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates by @xmath36^{1/2 } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ r_{23}&= & 2^{-1/2}{d_{23}}{r}\\left[1+\\sin{\\theta}\\cos(\\varphi+\\varphi_{23})\\right]^{1/2 } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ r_{31}&= & 2^{-1/2}{d_{31}}{r}\\left[1+\\sin{\\theta}\\cos(\\varphi+\\varphi_{31})\\right]^{1/2}. \\label{rij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mass - dependent angles are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "non - additive forces be can easily introduced in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) with effectively no cost to the calculations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the wave function must satisfy the condition @xmath40 to ensure that there is a one - to - one correspondence between these coordinates and lab - frame coordinates [ see eqs .",
    "( [ lf ] ) and ( [ coords ] ) ] .    in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation ,",
    "the total wave function is expanded in terms of the channel functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the hyperradial wave functions and @xmath44 represents all quantum numbers necessary to specify each channel .",
    "the channel functions @xmath41 form a complete set of orthonormal functions at each value of @xmath45 and are eigenfunctions of @xmath46 , @xmath47 the eigenvalues @xmath48 are the three - body potentials from which , as we will see next , one can define _ effective _ three - body potentials for the hyperradial motion .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ chfun ] ) into the schrdinger equation ( [ schreq ] ) and projecting out @xmath49 ( the volume element in 2d is @xmath50 @xcite ) , we obtain the hyperradial schrdinger equation ,    @xmath51f_{\\nu}(r )   -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\sum_{\\nu'\\ne\\nu } \\left[p_{\\nu\\nu'}(r)\\frac{d}{dr } + \\frac{d}{dr}p_{\\nu\\nu'}(r ) + q_{\\nu\\nu'}(r)\\right]f_{\\nu'}(r ) = ef_{\\nu}(r),\\label{radeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that describes the motion of the three - body system under the influence of the effective potentials @xmath52 as we will see in sec .",
    "[ potentials ] , including @xmath53 in the definition of the effective potential @xmath54 is crucial for obtaining potentials with the correct behavior at large distances . in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation , the nonadiabatic coupling terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) drive inelastic collisions and are defined as @xmath58 and @xmath59 the double brackets denote integration over the angular coordinates @xmath60 only . as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ radeq ] ) is exact . in practice , of course",
    ", the sum over channels must be truncated and the number of channels retained increased until one achieves the desired accuracy .",
    "to quickly assess the symmetry properties and degeneracy that are important for the large-@xmath45 behavior where interactions are negligible , we analyze the 2d non - interacting [ @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ had ] ) ] solutions , i.e. , the hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "the symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics will satisfy the boundary conditions we derive in sec .",
    "[ boundaryconditions ] and thus serves as a further confirmation of those findings .",
    "one interesting property of the three - body problem in 2d , unlike the 3d case , is that the hyperspherical harmonics can be written in closed form @xmath62 with @xmath63 being defined in terms of the wigner @xmath64-function as @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the hyperangular momentum quantum number , @xmath67 is a quantum number labeling degenerate eigenstates , and @xmath68 is the total orbital angular momentum . note that the condition in eq .",
    "( [ onetoone ] ) and the fact that @xmath69 ( from the properties of the wigner @xmath64-functions ) imply that @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 must all be either even or odd integers .",
    "this condition is satisfied if these quantum numbers  specifically @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72  obey the usual rules for angular momenta if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are regarded as projections of @xmath66 .    with this closed form for the hyperspherical harmonics",
    ", we can explore the allowed quantum numbers for a given permutation symmetry when the three - body system has indistinguishable particles .",
    "the idea is to determine the effects of the coordinate transformations due to parity @xmath73 and to permutations of particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath74 ) on these analytic functions .",
    "this analysis is outlined in app .",
    "[ permutations ] and summarized here : @xmath75 note that the hyperradius is invariant under all the symmetry operations above .",
    "note also that in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ pfirst])([plast ] ) the only non - trivial relation used was that the @xmath64-function in eq .",
    "( [ harmonics ] ) has the following property : @xmath76 .",
    "as one can see , the hyperspherical harmonics are already parity eigenstates .",
    "since @xmath68 is the total orbital angular momentum and is thus a good quantum number , none of the permutation operators change @xmath68 .",
    "the symmetrized harmonics we will construct based on eqs .",
    "( [ pfirst])([plast ] ) will thus remain parity eigenstates .      for three identical bosons ( @xmath77 )",
    ", we are interested in the completely symmetric hyperspherical harmonics . to obtain these states",
    ", we apply the ( un - normalized ) symmetrization operator , @xmath78 , to the hyperspherical harmonics defined in eq .",
    "( [ harmonics ] ) and use eqs .",
    "( [ pfirst])([plast ] ) .",
    "doing so , we find @xmath79 the prefactor here should not vanish .",
    "this condition determines , for a given value of @xmath68 , the allowed values for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . by inspection",
    ", we find that we must have @xmath80 note that these conditions are essentially what we found for the 3d case @xcite .",
    "now , we recall from eq .",
    "( [ onetoone ] ) that @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 must all be even or odd",
    ". equation  ( [ threebosonfn ] ) further tells us that if @xmath81 is odd , then @xmath67 can not be zero or the function will vanish .",
    "but , @xmath67 can only be zero if @xmath68 is even .",
    "so , we amend eq .",
    "( [ nucond1 ] ) to @xmath82 explicit examples for the allowed quantum numbers are given in table  [ threebosontab ] for the lowest few values of @xmath68 .",
    ".sample of allowed hyperspherical harmonic quantum numbers for three identical bosons ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we list the lowest few values for both @xmath66 and @xmath68 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ thresholdlawstab ]      in ultracold atomic gases , three - body recombination , @xmath83 is often the major atom - loss mechanism since the atomic states are typically chosen to eliminate two - body collisional losses .",
    "the atom and diatom produced have large kinetic energy and are thus lost from the trap . in general , calculating three - body recombination rates requires the infinity of initial continuum channels [ eq .  ( [ 3bcont ] ) ] , making the calculations extremely challenging . fortunately , at ultracold collision energies , the lowest continuum channel provides the dominant contribution . this simplification allows us to apply the wkb approach above by identifying @xmath84 , leading to @xmath85 for the three - body recombination rate , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . this result",
    "is also expected to be valid for energies much smaller than any other energy scale in the system @xcite .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ k3rate ] ) shows that for a given @xmath68 the dominant channel is determined by @xmath88 .",
    "table [ thresholdlawstab ] includes the three - body recombination threshold laws for all combinations of identical particles .",
    "the dominant partial wave contribution i.e. , the one that has the lowest value for @xmath89 is underlined in table [ thresholdlawstab ] .",
    "for instance , for bosonic systems @xmath77 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 is dominant with @xmath92 , implying that @xmath93 is constant for @xmath94 . for @xmath95 systems ,",
    "the dominant contribution is still @xmath91 , but with @xmath96 giving @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath98 systems , @xmath99 dominantes with @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "we note that for three identical bosons near an @xmath102 resonance , ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath93 to vanish in the limit of @xmath94 .",
    "the most likely explanation of this disagreement with the present analysis is that the logarithmic terms in @xmath54 mentioned above do indeed have a dramatic effect on the threshold laws .",
    "the time - reverse of three - body recombination , collision - induced dissociation , @xmath103 is only allowed if the collision energy is greater than the diatom binding energy such that the dissociation channels ( three - body continuum channels ) are energetically accessible .",
    "therefore , at ultracold temperatures only dissociation of weakly bound molecules is possible .",
    "because the collision - induced dissociation rate @xmath104 behaves as @xmath105 , it is the final three - body continuum channel that determines the threshold law since @xmath106 is finite at the breakup threshold where @xmath107 .",
    "the threshold law thus simplifies to @xmath108 we note that the energy dependence for @xmath109 differs from the one for @xmath93 by a factor @xmath110 due to the difference in phase - space factors from the reversed roles of the initial and final states .",
    "the @xmath109 threshold laws are also summarized in table [ thresholdlawstab ] .",
    "we have explored three - body systems in two dimensions using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation .",
    "we derived symmetry properties and boundary conditions for all permutation symmetries , establishing an efficient numerical approach for solving three - body problems in 2d . from explicit numerical examples",
    ", we demonstrated the asymptotic behavior of the three - body potentials and illustrated the topology of such potentials . from this analysis , complemented by our symmetry considerations",
    ", we were able to determine the threshold laws for atom - diatom inelastic collisions , as well as three - body recombination and collision - induced dissociation for various partial waves and symmetries .",
    "these results can be used for determining the expected collisional behavior and stability of ultracold atomic and molecular gases in two dimensions .",
    "the hyperspherical formalism we outline in this work is capable of treating three - body systems in which the two - body interactions can support deeply bound states as well as weakly bound states .",
    "thus , in contrast to the formalisms in which a zero - range model potential is used , our approach is suitable for studying more realistic systems where the finite range aspect of the interatomic interactions plays an important rule .",
