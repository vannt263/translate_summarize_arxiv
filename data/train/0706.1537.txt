    "the cepheid period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation is a fundamental tool in distance scale and stellar pulsation studies , which is traditionally studied in the standard johnson - cousin @xmath1 magnitude system .",
    "however , the magnitude system from the broad band filters employed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , hereafter sloan magnitudes ) are becoming more popular in current and future studies .",
    "for example , observations with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , the pan - starrs @xcite , the dark energy survey @xcite , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to name a few , will be done in the sloan filters .",
    "in addition to wide field imaging , many of these surveys will include a time - domain component to detect asteroids and supernovae .",
    "therefore , it is possible that a large number of variable stars , including cepheids , will be observed and/or detected from these surveys . the purpose of this paper is to provide semi - empirical cepheid p - l relations in the sloan magnitudes for current and future cepheid and distance scale studies ( for example , the m33 cepheids observed with cfht as presented in @xcite ) .",
    "since the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheid p - l relation is extensively used in distance scale studies , we use the publicly available lmc cepheid data from the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) database in this paper .",
    "the logarithmic periods , the extinction corrected @xmath1 band mean magnitudes and the extinction corrected @xmath3 colors for the fundamental mode lmc cepheids were obtained from the ogle database .",
    "we first remove cepheids without a @xmath3 color in the ogle sample .",
    "the remaining ogle lmc cepheids were then cross - correlated with the sample given in @xcite to remove outliers and `` bad '' cepheids in our ogle sample .",
    "additional lmc cepheids data are supplemented from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "however we only include cepheids with @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is pulsation period in days , see @xcite for detailing why cepheids are restricted to this range ) .",
    "our final sample consists of @xmath6 lmc cepheids with @xmath7 band photometric data , @xmath8 of them having periods less than 10 days . from our sample ,",
    "the fitted linear lmc p - l relations are :    @xmath9    with dispersion of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 and @xmath13 band , respectively . for completeness",
    ", we also include the @xmath14 band p - l relation from the @xmath15 cepheids in our sample that have the @xmath14 band mean magnitudes ( because the number of cepheids with @xmath16 colors is less than those with @xmath3 colors in @xcite sample ) :    @xmath17    with dispersion of @xmath18 .",
    "these p - l relations are in good agreement with the results presented by the ogle team , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is possible to derive semi - empirical p - l relations in the sloan magnitudes by combining the lmc @xmath7 cepheid data with theoretical bolometric corrections ( @xmath19 ) . in this paper",
    "we use the theoretical @xmath19 from the padova group @xcite , which are tabulated in grids with different metallicity , effective temperature ( @xmath20 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath21 $ ] ) .",
    "we first selected the @xmath19 within the grids of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are appropriate for classical cepheids at mean light , from all of the available metallicity ( @xmath24=\\{0.5,0.0,-0.5,-1.0,-1.5,-2.0,-2.5\\ } \\mathrm{dex}$ ] ) given by the padova group . to obtain the @xmath19 for lmc cepheids at @xmath24=-0.3\\mathrm{dex}$ ] , these grids of @xmath19 were then interpolated using the available metallicity . from the interpolated @xmath19",
    ", we obtain a regression between @xmath20 , @xmath25 and @xmath3 color in the form of :    @xmath26    which has a dispersion of @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , regressions for @xmath19 in passband @xmath28 takes the form of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "the coefficients in johnson - cousin @xmath1 and sloan @xmath0 passbands are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "lcccccc @xmath12 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & 0.057 + @xmath13 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & 0.012 + @xmath14 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & 0.009 +   + @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & 0.112 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 0.036 + @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & 0.006 + @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & 0.011 + @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & 0.004    for each of the lmc cepheids in our sample , the surface gravity can be estimated using @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath20 and the @xmath19 for our lmc cepheids can be determined using the regressions we found previously . by combining the definitions of bolometric correction ( @xmath77 ) and distance modulus ( @xmath78 )",
    ", we have @xmath79 .",
    "then for each of the individual lmc cepheids in our sample , @xmath80 is a constant and _ independent of passband_. this quantity can be estimated using either @xmath81 or @xmath82 with available @xmath7 mean magnitudes , or using either @xmath82 or @xmath83 with available @xmath84 mean magnitudes .",
    "the mean difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 for our lmc cepheids is @xmath85mag . with a standard deviation of @xmath86mag . , while the difference for @xmath82 and @xmath83 is @xmath27mag . with a larger standard deviation of @xmath87mag .",
    "for the @xmath6 lmc cepheids in our sample , we adopt the averaged value of @xmath88/3 $ ] if all three @xmath1 band data are available for a given cepheid , else we use @xmath89/2 $ ] as the averaged value from @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "once the values of @xmath80 and the @xmath19 in sloan magnitudes are known for each cepheid in the sample , the apparent sloan magnitudes can be estimated by @xmath90 and the p - l relations can be derived .    to test the above semi - empirical approach , we assume that only the lmc @xmath12 band data are available for the @xmath6 cepheids and derive the semi - empirical @xmath13 band p - l relation . using @xmath91 , the resulting semi - empirical @xmath13 band p - l relation is : @xmath92 with a dispersion of @xmath93 . doing the same for the @xmath12 band data , the semi - empirical @xmath12 band p - l relation is : @xmath94 with a dispersion of @xmath95 .",
    "both of the semi - empirical p - l relations are in good agreement with equation ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) : the difference in the slope is less than @xmath96mag . and the zero - points are almost identical in both passbands",
    ". for testing the semi - empirical @xmath14 band p - l relation , we use both of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 band mean magnitudes and @xmath89/2 $ ] for the common cepheids to derive equation ( 3 ) , and the resulted semi - empirical @xmath14 band p - l relation is : @xmath97 with a dispersion of @xmath98 , which is still in good agreement with equation ( 3 ) . therefore , the above semi - empirical approach can be used to derive p - l relations in sloan magnitudes , which we summarize in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the plots of these p - l relations are presented in figure [ pl ] .",
    "note that the dispersion of the p - l relation decreases from @xmath46 to @xmath70 passbands .",
    "this reduction of the dispersion as wavelength increases is well - known in the cepheid community ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "the johnson - sloan photometric transformations that are available in the literature can be used to transform the @xmath7 mean magnitudes for our lmc cepheids to the sloan magnitudes . the transformation for @xmath109 magnitudes ( from the united states naval observatory 40-inch telescope ) are availale , for example , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; while the transformation for @xmath0 magnitudes ( from the sdss 2.5-meter telescope ) are given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these transformations in general take the form of @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , for the @xmath3 color .",
    "therefore the observed @xmath13 band mean magnitudes and @xmath3 colors for the lmc cepheids can be transformed to the sloan magnitudes , and the p - l relations can be fitted in these passbands .",
    "this serves as an independent check to our results presented in the previous section . in this paper",
    "we apply the transformation from @xcite only , but the resulting p - l relations from other transformations are available upon request . using @xcite transformation ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath112 with a dispersion of @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a dispersion of @xmath115 , which are in good agreement to the p - l relations given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "however , there is a major drawback to using the johnson - sloan photometric transformation to obtain the empirical p - l relations .",
    "the empirical johnson - sloan photometric transformations available in the literature are mostly derived from the standard stars , which could span a wide range of luminosity class @xcite , effective temperature and/or metallicity ( which could be close to the solar value , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , cepheids are cool supergiants with spectral type from @xmath116 to @xmath117",
    ". therefore the photometric transformations may not be applicable to the lmc cepheids . to test this",
    ", we use the same theoretical bolometric corrections in section 2 to obtain the theoretical johnson - sloan transformation for two `` extreme '' cases :    case 1 : we use the grids of @xmath19 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are appropriate for cepheids at mean light with metallicity @xmath24=-0.3 $ ] , to represent the lmc cepheids .",
    "case 2 : we use the grids of @xmath19 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , to represent the standard stars that cover a wide range of effective temperature and surface gravity , and metallicity of @xmath24=0.0 $ ] and @xmath24=-0.5 $ ] which roughly bracket the solar metallicity and lmc - type metallicity . figure [ sdss ] compares the grids of theoretical colors with the colors of standard stars , which shows that the theoretical colors are well covered by the observation of standard stars .",
    "the johnson - sloan transformations are then derived from these grids of theoretical colors . after obtaining the transformations for the two cases as mentioned , we transform our lmc cepheid data to the sloan magnitudes and fit the linear p - l relations . the differences ( @xmath120 ) of the slope from the fitted @xmath2 p - l relations for these two cases are : @xmath121 and @xmath122 ; while the difference for the zero - point are : @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the small differences between the p - l relations of case 1 and case 2 implies that the derived p - l relation in the sloan magnitudes , at least in the @xmath2 passbands , will be insensitive to the adopted transformations .",
    "therefore , we believe the adopted transformations from the literature should not significantly affect the empirical p - l relations .",
    "the work for verifying the transformations for cepheids in a more proper and rigorous way is currently underway with cepheids in m33 by bersier et al .",
    "( in preparation  private communication ) .",
    "using the observed @xmath1 mean magnitudes from lmc cepheids and the theoretical bolometric corrections from padova group , we derive semi - empirical cepheid p - l relations in the sloan magnitudes that can be used in the current and future distance scale and cepheid works . for a sanity check",
    ", we compare the @xmath2 band p - l relations derived from adopting the available johnson - sloan photometric transformation in the literature to our semi - empirical p - l relations .",
    "the resulting comparison finds that these two sets of p - l relation are generally consistent with each other .",
