    "subsequent research has started to analyze the initial mass function ( imf ) with three power laws , see @xcite and four power laws , see @xcite .",
    "a first comment on this temporal evolution is that the name is not appropriate because the power function distribution @xmath6 is defined only for positive values of @xmath7 , see @xcite .",
    "a second comment is that the exact name for a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath8 with @xmath9 is the pareto distribution .",
    "a third comment is that this progressive increase in the number of segments has limited the development of new or modified pdfs .",
    "the approach to the imf by a continuous distribution has been modeled by the lognormal distribution in order to fit both the range of the stars and the brown dwarfs ( bds ) regime , see @xcite .",
    "recall that usually the standard pdfs such as the lognormal , gamma , generalized gamma , and weibull are defined in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the number of stars with mass @xmath11 is nearly zero suggests a left truncated pdf .",
    "our analysis has therefore been focused on the beta distribution , which by definition has an upper bound . from the previous analysis",
    "the following questions can be raised .",
    "* is it possible to find the constant of normalization for a left truncated beta pdf ?",
    "* is it possible to derive an analytical expression for the mean , the mode , and the distribution function of a left truncated beta pdf ?",
    "* is a left truncated beta pdf an acceptable model for the imf as well as a real sample of masses ?    in order to answer the previous questions , we first review some standard pdfs , see section [ existing ] . we subsequently introduce the various beta pdfs , the convolution of a beta pdf with a normal pdf , and a left truncated beta , see section [ secbeta ] . in order to find out which pdf performs best ,",

    "this section reviews the galactic imf as modeled by three and four power laws pdfs and fits the masses of the cluster ngc 2362 and the cluster ngc 6611 with the various pdfs here considered .",
    "the imf is usually modeled by two or three power laws of the type @xmath117 each zone being characterized by a different exponent @xmath118 . in order to have a pdf normalized to unity , one must have @xmath119 for example , we start with @xmath120=1 : @xmath121 will be determined by the following equation @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a small number , e.g. , @xmath124 . in the previous equation we insert @xmath125 and @xmath126 and therefore @xmath121 = 0.503 .",

    "we have covered the galactic four power laws , we now introduce the generalized four power laws @xmath137 which in the case of ngc 2362 is @xmath138 and in the case of ngc 6611 is @xmath139      a photometric survey of ngc 2362 allows of deducing the mass of 271 stars in the range @xmath140 , see @xcite and the data in j / mnras/384/675 at the centre de donns astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) .",

    "* motivations * in the last 50 years , the imf has been modeled progressively by one power law , by two power laws , three power laws , and four power laws .",
    "the three power law distribution has seven parameters and the four power law has nine , and they both have a finite range of existence .",
    "a second widely used fitting function is the lognormal , which is characterized by two parameters and is defined on the interval @xmath14 $ ] . in this paper , we have described a left truncated beta pdf which has ( i ) a lower and an upper bound , ( ii ) a finite value of probability on the lower bound rather than zero , ( iii ) two parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which fix the shape of the distribution , ( iv ) an analytical expression for the average value .",
    "two physical meanings are distinguished : ( i ) the upper limit of the left truncated beta is connected with the maximum stellar mass , which is @xmath141 , ( ii ) the lower limit is connected with an unknown physical mechanism which limits the distribution in masses .",
    "further on we remember that the lognormal pdf has the important disadvantage of missing the well - accepted salpeter - type high - mass power law .",
    "the high masses behavior of the various pdfs here analyzed is reported in figure [ beta_salpeter ] for ngc 6611 where the pareto and truncated pareto pdfs are evaluated for @xmath142 , which means salpeter slope -2.3 . from the previous figure",
    "the discrepancy of the lognormal and double pareto - lognormal at high masses is evident .",
    "* goodness of fit tests * the statistical tests here performed are split in two : ( i ) a first test requires binning the data in order to evaluate @xmath87 , and the indicators are @xmath104 , the aic , and the probability @xmath109 ; ( ii ) the k - s test does not require binning the data , and the two indicators are @xmath38 and @xmath115 .",
    "these two tests , when applied to ngc2362 and ngc6611 , indicate that the beta family ( general and left truncated ) performs better than the lognormal distribution both when the binning of the data is computed , see tables example , the k - s test for the mass distribution of ngc6611 indicates a confidence level of @xmath143 for the left truncated beta and @xmath144 for the lognormal .",
    "new confidence levels can be found with the anderson - darling test which is a modification of the k - s test , see @xcite and the discussion at https://asaip.psu.edu/articles/beware-the-kolmogorov-smirnov-test .",
    "currently tables of critical values for the anderson - darling test are available for the lognormal pdf but the critical values for other pdfs here explored are not yet available , see http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook .",
    "* convolution * the random sum ( convolution ) of a general beta and a normal random variable , as represented by equation ( [ convolution ] ) , when applied to ngc6611 introduces a further parameter , @xmath36 , which increases @xmath145 and the aic from that of the general beta , but decreases @xmath38 and @xmath115 in the k - s test , see table [ chi2valuesngc6611 ] .    * the mode * a careful attention should be paid to the falloff of the imf towards the brown dwarfs .",
    "the left truncated beta pdf , see pdf ( [ betatruncated ] ) , once the numbers of the open cluster ngc6611 are inserted , see figure [ beta_log_ngc6611 ] , decreases after the maximum at @xmath146 .",
    "this fact can be explained by the following taylor expansion @xmath147 the previous decreasing function converts itself into an increasing function when the integration is performed @xmath148 and we recall that the evaluation of the frequencies corresponds to an integration .    *",
    "lognormal family * the recently formulated double pareto - lognormal distribution draws attention to a possible alternative to the lognormal .",
    "our tests show that the double pareto - lognormal lowers the value of the maximum distance , @xmath38 , of the k - s test , see tables [ chi2valuesngc2362 ] and [ chi2valuesngc6611 ] .",
    "inconveniently , at the moment of writing there are no analytical evaluations of the four parameters which characterize the double pareto - lognormal .    * the astronomical sample",
    "* the new pdfs here presented can be tested on an astronomical sample representative of the imf .",
    "currently not all the various catalogs available on cds report the column of the mass . as an example the promising imf of ic 348 , see figure 11 in @xcite , is not available on cds .                        ,",
