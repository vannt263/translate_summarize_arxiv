    "this paper connects to recent advances towards quantum theory on octonionic algebra @xcite , and supplies the result for lowest - order quantum gravitational coulomb scattering of a spin-1/2 particle on a static point target , in a four dimensional euclidean quantum gravity model on complex octonions .",
    "the resulting elastic scattering cross section has properties that one might expect from gravity : backscattering is enhanced , the cross section does not vanish for increasing energies , and the general weakness of quantum gravitational interaction poses challenges for experimental validation .",
    "a new effect also appears : the observed elastic scattering cross section may not be smaller than a finite area element , which only depends on the charges of particle and target .",
    "it is concluded that a quantized charge implies a minimum area of interaction in this model , a quantum of area .    in principle , this observation is consistent with approaches to gravity on quantized length elements , namely loop quantum gravity , and it is pointed out that here it originates from a model that approximates general relativity on the non - quantum scale .",
    "the gravitational elastic scattering cross section @xmath1 will be calculated in lowest order , for a massive spin 1/2 particle on a static target , as follows :    1 .   within the generally non - associative complex octonion formulation of electromagnetism and gravity , the `` circular dirac equation '' from @xcite , equation ( 26 ) ,",
    "will be identified as the associative subalgebra , modeling four dimensional euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "2 .   a static @xmath0 potential will be supplied according to @xcite equation ( 13 ) , to yield the cross section @xmath1 without spin .",
    "3 .   the spin contribution will be calculated , and shown to increase backscattering .",
    "a spin - flip will not occur .",
    "4 .   in order to quantify this effect for the experiment ,",
    "the semi - classical projection from euclidean into minkowskian observer space - time geometry will be executed , according to @xcite proposition 4 ( `` _ _ natalie equations _ _ '' ) .",
    "5 .   in the result ,",
    "forward- and backscattering effects will be in qualitative agreement with _ general relativity _ expectations .",
    "the interaction yields a minimum area element .",
    "complex octonions are octonions with complex number coefficients , @xmath2 , and are synonymous with `` conic sedenions '' in some of the referenced publications @xcite . in the current paper , terminology will be used that is more common with contemporary uses , i.e.  complex octonions ( instead of `` conic sedenions '' ) , split - octonions ( instead of `` hyperbolic octonions '' ) , and octonions ( instead of `` circular octonions '' ) .",
    "complex octonions will be expressed to a basis @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a chosen octonion basis , and the remaining elements @xmath5 result from multiplication with the commutative and associative @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a complete multiplication table",

    "the @xmath35 matrix relations ( [ eq : betamatricesmetrictensorisunity ] ) and ( [ eq : sumbetabetappeqyalsp2 ] ) are closely related to the electromagnetic case , and allow to obtain the transition matrix element @xmath36 in lowest order , for elastic scattering , accordingly as:@xmath37 separating the spin effects into a factor @xmath38 to be calculated later , the remaining parts of the wave functions @xmath39 , from @xcite relations ( 20 ) through ( 23 ) , have identical properties as in the electromagnetic case , and yield in the textbook result:@xmath40 here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the initial and final energy of the particle being scattered , @xmath43 is the unit volume of interaction , and @xmath44 is the change in momentum , @xmath45 .",
    "the well - known result for such @xmath46 potential is:@xmath47      introducing the spin contribution to the circular dirac equation , on euclidean space - time @xmath48 , requires the normalized eigenstates of @xcite relations ( 20 ) through ( 23 ) .",
    "coordinates are rotated such that the incoming particle will be travelling in @xmath49 direction , and scattering happens in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "as the entire calculation is independent of the orientation of the time axis , particles @xmath51 yield the same result as anti - particles @xmath52 .",
    "for particles , the normalized eigenstates become:@xmath53 spin flip may not occur , as expected:@xmath54 for unchanged spin @xmath55 we have:@xmath56    in terms of total momentum @xmath57 and scattering angle @xmath58 , the relations@xmath59 yield:@xmath60 because @xmath61 due to symmetry , the total spin contribution is:@xmath62 using @xmath63 and @xmath64 , this becomes:@xmath65    the spin contribution yields a significant deviation from the electromagnetic case , for this ( hypothetical ) interaction on purely euclidean space - time : backscattering @xmath66 is enhanced ( rather than suppressed ) , and increasing kinetic energy of the incoming particle further enhances the elastic cross section ( instead of reducing it ) .",
    "it is noted , however , that no such particle is known to exist , as it would be interacting solely through gravitation ( and no other force ) , and would not be bound to the speed limit of light , or heisenberg uncertainty . the following section will approximate how known particles would be affected by such a force .",
    "solving the complex octonion equation of motion ( [ eq : diraceqngremfieldcon16 ] ) in the general case , for a spin 1/2 particle in electromagnetic and gravitational fields , requires mathematical methods yet to be determined .",
    "argumentation has been proposed in @xcite , that traditional quantum mechanical observables result from the associative subalgebras of an otherwise non - associative , wider algebraic space .",
    "it therefore appears feasible to use above calculations , as obtained from an associative formulation on euclidean space - time , and project it onto the human observer space - time , which is minkowskian .",
    "this follows the same semi - classical limit as executed in @xcite , termed the `` _ _ natalie _ _ equations '' program , which was used there to show that such approach yields _ general relativity _ for large bodies .",
    "there , it was shown in relation ( 58 ) , that the projected @xmath0 potential of a point mass @xmath10 , at rest at the coordinate origin , would be seen by a minkowskian observer with speed @xmath67 relative to @xmath10:@xmath68 namely , a factor @xmath69 needed to be applied to the static @xmath0 potential , which led to the linearized einstein field equations for gravity .",
    "applied to the current calculations for spin 1/2 particle scattering , such factor yields a transition matrix element that can not be expressed anymore in closed form , as @xmath70 is a non - trivial function of space and time .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath36 from relation ( [ eq : sfiforoneoverxpotential ] ) above is:@xmath71    it is possible , however , to approximate this expression for non - relativistic @xmath67 and determine the resulting cross section in closed form , as will now be shown .",
    "using@xmath72 and the non - relativistic@xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the initial kinetic energy at @xmath75 ) , one can approximate:@xmath76    the @xmath0 coulomb potential is enhanced by a small factor , and a new @xmath77 term is present . with @xmath78 being the fourier pair to @xmath0",

    "spin contribution , as well as projection from euclidean geometry ( governing gravity ) into minkowskian observer geometry , in non - relativistic approximation , provide additional terms @xmath83 and @xmath84 which enhance backscattering .",
    "they also prevent the total cross section from vanishing at higher energies .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement , e.g. , with textbook results from scattering of a non - quantum particle on a black hole : increased backscattering is commonly refered to as `` glory '' , and a black hole will always retain a finite area of capture of the incoming particle , no matter how large @xmath57 or @xmath25 are .",
    "a new effect is apparent when taking the spin contribution into account as well : relation ( [ eq : xsectionwspin ] ) contains a constant factor @xmath85 , that is independent from the dynamic parameters @xmath57 , @xmath25 , and angular distribution @xmath58 . in other words ,",

    "this radius compares to the planck length roughly the same as the planck length compares to the visible universe , and therefore safely removes the effect from being accessible directly , through any experiment .",
    "in this paper , operator quantum gravity on four dimensional euclidean space - time has been evaluated , for elastic spin 1/2 particle scattering on a static target , in lowest order .",
    "it was found that backscattering is enhanced , and that the cross section does not disappear for high energies .",
    "a minimum scattering cross section appears , which only depends on the interacting particles masses and charges . with all known matter currently assumed to be built from spin 1/2 particles , and elastic scattering in lowest order arguably the most fundamental type of interaction ,",
    "this suggests that it is possible in principle to build models of quantum gravity on the assumption of a quantized area element , to yield general relativity in the large body , non - quantum limit .",
    "further investigation will determine whether an operator description of forces other than gravity and electromagnetism is possible @xcite , whether octonionic spinors allow to model the fermion generations of the standard model @xcite , and how this may relate to the symmetry groups used in classical quantum field theory @xcite ."
