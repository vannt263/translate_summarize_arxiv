    "transition metal chalcogenides ( tmd ) are mostly layered materials with composition mx@xmath0 , where m is transition metal like w , mo , ti , nb , ta , etc . and x is a chalcogen such as s , se , te .",
    "while studied since long ago@xcite they are currently of large interest , recently partly motivated also by the possibility of preparing graphene - like monolayers refs.@xcite .",
    "their bulk phases exhibit a broad spectrum of electronic behaviour , from insulator to semiconductor to superconductor @xcite . besides that they exhibit also rich structural diversity , which is related to two possibilities for local sixfold coordination ( trigonal prism or octahedral ) , number of layers in the unit cell and stacking order , resulting in number of possible structures , such as 1 t , 2h , 3r , etc@xcite .",
    "it is well known that their electronic properties can be modified by doping@xcite .",
    "another important instrument allowing to tune their properties is pressure which can induce structural as well as electronic transitions .    in this study",
    "we focus on mo - based tmds which include mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 . at ambient conditions",
    "all three compounds adopt a stable hexagonal 2h@xmath1 structure , where mo atoms are in trigonal prism coordination@xcite .",
    "this form is semiconducting with an indirect gap around 1 ev . besides this form",
    ", mos@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 are also known in metastable 3r form which differs from 2h@xmath1 only by layer stacking . on the other hand",
    ", mote@xmath0 can be prepared also in metallic metastable @xmath4-mote@xmath0 monoclinic structure ( space group _ p2@xmath5/m _ ) with distorted octahedral layers@xcite . unlike 2h@xmath1 ( also called @xmath6-mote@xmath0 )",
    "this form is semimetallic at ambient pressure . besides the @xmath4-form also an orthorombic t@xmath7 structure with distorted layers is known@xcite .    among the three compounds ,",
    "the most studied one under pressure is mos@xmath0 .",
    "it has been studied experimentally up to 38.8 gpa in ref.@xcite where an unexplained structural transition was found around 20 gpa .",
    "the results of this study were theoretically explained in ref.@xcite by proposing a phase transition consisting of layer sliding .",
    "this interpretation was experimentally confirmed in refs.@xcite where the system was studied up to 51 gpa and 81 gpa , respectively . in the latter study mos@xmath0",
    "was also found to undergo a metallization transition resulting from band overlap between 30 - 40 gpa , in agreement with theoretical prediction in ref.@xcite .",
    "the behaviour at even higher pressure in the mbar range was recently studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically in ref.@xcite . while the theoretical work@xcite predicted a phase transition to a new tetragonal phase with space group _ p4/mmm _ at 138 gpa or a chemical decomposition at 135 gpa to mos and elemental sulphur , experimentally no structural transition",
    "was observed up to 200 gpa .",
    "the discrepancy can most likely be attributed to the slow kinetics at high pressure conditions .    in ref.@xcite the possibility of a layer sliding transition , similar to that in mos@xmath0 ,",
    "was studied theoretically in mose@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that in these materials the 2h@xmath3 structure is actually less stable then the 2h@xmath1 one , due to larger volume , and therefore no sliding transition takes place .",
    "the systems were predicted to metallize at 40 and 19 gpa , respectively .",
    "this result for mose@xmath0 was confirmed in ref.@xcite together with the lack of sliding transition up to 60 gpa . in ref.@xcite , however , no structural search was performed in order to identify possible transitions to other structures in mose@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 .",
    "nothing is therefore known about the behaviour of mose@xmath0 beyond 60 gpa , neither theoretically nor experimentally . in case of mote@xmath0 a lot of experimental activity",
    "was recently devoted to study of its properties at ambient pressure .",
    "main interest was given to its orthorhombic phase t@xmath7 which was proposed@xcite and more recently proven to be a type ii weyl semimetal@xcite .",
    "possible transitions to other stable structures at high pressure , however , remain unknown .    in this paper",
    "we aim at filling the gap in understanding of the high - pressure behaviour of mose@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 up to mbar pressures . by applying evolutionary algorithms in combination with _",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ methods ]",

    "we present our predictions for both materials and analyze their properties . in the final section [ conclusions ]",

    "was chosen 70 ry , grid of q - points was chosen @xmath11 in both materials .",
    "we have performed various evolutionary searches with up to four formula units of mose@xmath0 up to 150 gpa and up to eight formula units of mote@xmath0 up to 110 gpa ( for more details about search settings see supplemental material@xcite ) . for search in mose@xmath0",
    "we have used as a starting population only randomly generated structures . in case of mote@xmath0 at 50 gpa",

    "one of them represents chemical decomposition to mose + se , where mose adopts the cscl structure , again similarly to the case of mos@xmath0 @xcite and se the se - vi structure@xcite . since the structure of mose at conditions of the phase transition was unknown , an additional evolutionary search was performed and indeed confirmed the cscl structure . for similar kinetic reasons as in case of _",
    "p4/mmm _ we believe that such decomposition might not be easily observed , at least at room temperature .",
    "a plausible scenario therefore appears to be a transition to a tetragonal phase with space group _ i4/mmm _ ( no.139 ) which becomes stable with respect to 2h@xmath1 at 150 gpa .",
    "this phase also represents a layered structure ( fig.[fig_i4mmm ] ) , however , mo atom now has an eightfold rather than sixfold coordination .",
    "while the structure is somewhat similar to cac@xmath0 , the lattice parameters ratio @xmath15 is substantially higher in _ i4/mmm _ and therefore in contrast to cac@xmath0 the new phase has a layered character . to our knowledge such structure",

    "it appears plausible to assume that this structure could be created from 2h@xmath1 via a simple uniaxial compression or shear bringing two more chalcogen atoms in the vicinity of mo atom as shown schematically in fig.[fig_i4mmm ] ( see also the next subsection [ mote2 ] ) . since such mechanism does not require diffusion of atoms , the",

    "we thus predict it to be a likely candidate for the experimental outcome of compression of 2h@xmath1 beyond 150 gpa even though it is only metastable with respect to both _ p4/mmm _ and decomposition .",
    "we note that this structure was also found for mos@xmath0 in the study in ref.@xcite , however , in that case it has enthalpy higher than 2h@xmath3 at 150 gpa by 0.51 ev per formula unit and therefore we did not consider it further .",

    "we can speculate that the observed metastability of the 2h@xmath3 phase up to 200 gpa in ref.@xcite could be possibly related to the high enthalpy of the _",

    "assuming mote adopts the same cscl structure as found in case of mos@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 and te adopts the bcc te - v@xcite structure , mote@xmath0 does not appear to be prone to chemical decomposition at any pressure between 0 and 130 gpa .",

    "phonon dispersion curves are shown in fig.[fig : phonon ] .",
