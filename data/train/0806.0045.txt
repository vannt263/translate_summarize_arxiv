    "laser - plasma interaction ( lpi ) @xcite is an important plasma - physics problem which poses serious challenges to theoretical modeling .",
    "lpi is the basis of several applications , including laser - based particle acceleration @xcite and the backward raman amplifier @xcite .",
    "moreover , for inertial confinement fusion ( icf)@xcite to succeed , lpi must not be so active that it prevents the desired laser energy from being delivered to the target , with the desired spatial and temporal behavior .",
    "this paper focuses on modeling the backscatter instabilities , where a laser light wave ( mode 0 ) decays into a backscattered light wave ( mode 1 ) and a plasma wave ( mode 2 ) . in stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) and stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) , the plasma wave is , respectively , an electron plasma wave and an ion acoustic wave .",
    "these lpi processes pose a serious risk to indirect - drive icf @xcite .",
    "a wide array of computational tools is used to model lpi , ranging from rapid ( @xmath0secs ) calculations of linear gains along 1d profiles to massively - parallel kinetic particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "we present here a new tool , called deplete , to the less computationally expensive end of this spectrum .",
    "deplete solves for the pump intensity and scattered - wave spectral density for a set of scattered frequencies , in steady - state , along a 1d profile of plasma conditions .",
    "pump depletion is included , and the plasma waves are assumed to be in the strong damping limit ( i.e. , they do not advect ) .",
    "fully kinetic ( although linear ) formulas are used for various quantities like the coupling coefficient .",
    "bremsstrahlung noise and damping , as well as thomson scattering ( ts ) , are included .",
    "the deplete model , especially the noise sources , in some ways resembles that of ref.@xcite .",
    "other similar works which have influenced our thinking , and use 1d coupled - mode equations , are refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "deplete is a 1d model , but the plasma conditions are generally found by tracing 3d geometric - optics ray paths through the output of a radiation - hydrodynamics code .",
    "we therefore call this combined approach to studying lpi a ray - based one . details of this methodology , and its limits , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : ray ] .",
    "deplete is similar to the code newlip , which calculates linear gains for srs and sbs along 1d profiles ( newlip is discussed here in appendix a ) .",
    "both codes take seconds to analyze one profile from the laser entrance to the high - z wall in an icf ignition design . however , deplete includes substantially more physics than newlip , such as pump depletion , noise sources , and re - absorption of scattered light .",
    "deplete moreover provides pump and scattered intensities , which unlike gains can be directly compared with experiment and more sophisticated lpi codes . despite its simplicity , deplete agrees well in certain cases with results from the 3d paraxial laser propagation code pf3d .",
    "this is quite promising given deplete s much lower computing cost .",
    "there is important physics which deplete does not capture , with laser speckles or hot spots being one of the most important .",
    "recent sbs experiments @xcite at the omega laser facility @xcite show good agreement between measured reflectivity and pf3d predictions , while deplete gives a lower value .",
    "this is due to the speckle pattern of the phase plate smoothed lasers .",
    "[ s : nif ] describes one approximate way to bound the speckle enhancement by doubling the coupling coefficient ; the resulting deplete reflectivity always exceeds the experimental level . a more sophisticated idea for handling speckles",
    "is outlined in the conclusion .",
    "additional beam smoothing , like polarization smoothing ( ps ) and smoothing by spectral dispersion ( ssd ) , reduce the effective speckle intensity and can reduce the reflectivity even below the speckle - free deplete level .",

    "in particular , we show the effect of scattered light re - absorption and put a bound on speckle enhancement .",
    "we conclude and discuss future prospects in sec.[s : conc ] . a review of newlip and its linear gain is presented in appendix a. appendix b details the numerics of deplete s coupling - thomson step .",
    "we derive coupled - mode equations , in time and one space dimension , for the slowly - varying wave envelopes , and find the resulting intensity equations .",
    "we do this for the light waves first , and then the plasma wave in the strong damping limit .",
    "since our approach is standard we summarize some steps .",
    "we take these equations in steady state to apply independently at each scattered frequency , and transition to a spectrum of scattered light per angular frequency .",
    "this may be viewed as a `` completely incoherent '' treatment of the scattered light at different frequencies .",

    "focusing of the whole beam is finally accounted for , giving the system deplete solves .",

    "several future directions exist for deplete .",
    "one is to include an `` independent speckle '' model for gain enhancement , where one solves the deplete equations over a speckle length for a distribution of pump intensities and then re - distributes the power .",
    "this would not describe correlations among axial ranks of speckles , caused e.g.  by phase conjugation .",
    "deplete also enables some new diagnostics and applications .",
    "the pump and scattered intensities found by deplete can be used to compute the local material heating rate due to absorption .",
    "this could be incorporated into a hydrodynamic code , thereby coupling lpi to target evolution in a self - consistent , if simplified , way .",
    "in addition , the plasma - wave amplitudes found by deplete can be compared against thresholds for various nonlinearities to assess their relevance , and may allow estimation of hot electron production by srs .    despite its promise , there are limits inherent to any 1d or ray - based approach , stemming from 3d wave optics ( e.g. diffraction , speckles , filamentation , and beam bending ) .",
    "a 3d paraxial code called slip @xcite , which like deplete operates in steady state and uses kinetic coefficients , is being developed .",
    "this model is in some sense intermediate between deplete and pf3d .",
    "1d codes like deplete still have a valuable role .",
    "they can analyze hundreds of rays , using hundreds of scattered wavelengths , in @xmath0 minutes , thus allowing designs to be rapidly analyzed and compared .",
    "the resulting time - dependent spectra allow for contact with experimental diagnostics , and are frequently needed , for example , to choose the carrier @xmath109 and @xmath338 for pf3d .",
    "laser - plasma interactions have proven to be a very challenging area of plasma physics , owing to the variety of relevant physics and extreme range of scales involved .",
    "this has led to an equally extreme range of modeling tools , from 1d gain estimates to 3d kinetic simulations . by fully exploiting these tools ,",
    "each with their uses and limitations , a more complete picture is emerging .",

    "in this appendix , we document the laser interaction post - processor newlip , of which deplete can be viewed as an extension .",
    "the equations underlying newlip are @xmath339 the first of these is eq .",
    "( [ eq : i0gov ] ) with no pump depletion ( @xmath340 ) , and the second is eq .",
    "( [ eq : i1gov ] ) with no bremsstrahlung or ts ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "that is , only the absorption of the pump , and coherent coupling to scattered light waves , are modeled .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath342 ( the known pump at the laser entrance ) , and @xmath343 .",
    "we thus solve for a unit scattered - wave boundary seed , which is permissible for this linear system .",
    "we readily solve eqs .",

    "the numerical computation of @xmath237 suffers from the problem of narrow resonances , similar to deplete .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath199 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gam1res ] ) ) is sharply peaked near the resonance point where @xmath234 .",

    "we approximate @xmath352 ( and similarly for @xmath77 ) , with @xmath353 and @xmath354 for some quantity @xmath221 . with this representation , and @xmath355 , we find @xmath356}.\\ ] ] this formula is valid provided either @xmath357 or @xmath358 . for accuracy , we also want @xmath359 to not be too small ( which obtains , e.g. , for a flat profile ) .",
