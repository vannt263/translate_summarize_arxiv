    "the laser spectroscopy measurement of the hyperfine structure of the ground state of the muonic hydrogen atom was first proposed more than two decades ago @xcite , motivated by the understanding that in some sense it would be complementary to the top accuracy measurements of the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) in ordinary hydrogen @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies revealed , however , some severe difficulties to this goal : the absence of a tunable near - infrared ( nir ) laser with sufficient power that necessitates the use of a multi - pass optical cavity to enhance the stimulation of transitions between the hyperfine levels , which in turn makes inapplicable the initially proposed experimental method . in the following years an alternative experimental method was proposed that exploits specific features of the muon transfer reaction at epithermal collision energies @xcite and is compatible with the use of a multi - pass cavity . also , the recent progress in the development of pulsed nir sources of monochromatic radiation and ir optics @xcite has brought the produced laser power close to the needed magnitudes .",
    "all this made the experimental project look feasible , though still remaining a significant challenge .",
    "what supplied the missing motivation to start the work on the project were the results of the recent muonic hydrogen lamb shift experiment at psi @xcite and the discovered incompatibility of the values of the charge radius of the proton extracted from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy on the one hand , and ordinary hydrogen spectroscopy and electron - proton scattering data , on the other .",
    "the few years of intense search for an explanation of this discrepancy have not lead to any conclusion , and the most direct way to throw light on the subject  next to an independent new measurement of the proton charge radius  appears to be the measurement of the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen and extracting from it the proton zemach radius : confirming the value obtained from hydrogen spectroscopy would probably give more weight to the explanations supposing methodology uncertainties in the hydrogen - based proton charge radius , while in the opposite case the search for new physics will have good reasons to be intensified .    with this motivation in mind , as a first stage of the preparation for the measurement of the hfs in muonic hydrogen",
    ", we started the thorough study of the efficiency and accuracy of the method proposed for this experiment in ref .",
    "its physical background is simple : the muonic hydrogen atoms that absorb a photon of the resonance frequency , undergo a hyperfine para - to - ortho transition .",
    "when de - excited back to the para spin state in a collision with a h@xmath0 molecule , these atoms are accelerated by @xmath1  ev @xcite . the number of atoms that have undergone the above sequence ( and therefore  the tuning of the laser to the resonance hyperfine transition frequency ) can be determined by observing a reaction whose rate depends on the energy of the @xmath2 atoms . in ref .  @xcite it was proposed to observe the transfer of the muon from muonic hydrogen to the nucleus of a heavier gas added to the hydrogen target for which the transfer rate is energy - dependent in the epithermal range .",
    "there are experimental evidences that for some gases ( e.g. , oxygen , argon , etc . )",
    "this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "the goal of our investigations is to obtain reliable quantitative data on the energy dependence of the rate of muon transfer to these gases  and possibly other as well  in order to select the optimal chemical composition and physical parameters ( pressure , temperature ) of the hydrogen gas target that will provide the highest accuracy in the future measurements of the hyperfine splitting of @xmath3 and the zemach radius of the proton . in the present paper we focus at the main physical processes with @xmath2 atoms in a mixture of hydrogen and a higher - z gas , and",
    "deduce the optimal experimental conditions for the measurement of the energy dependence of the muon transfer rate to the admixture gas .",
    "the results have been obtained with a monte carlo simulation code that uses the cross sections and rates for the scattering @xmath4 , which were calculated in refs .",
    "the code has been verified on the many preceding occasions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the muon transfer in collisions of muonic hydrogen atoms with atoms of higher - z gas admixtures has been actively investigated for many years because of the important impact of hydrogen impurities on the observable rates of specific reactions such as nuclear muon capture @xcite , muonic molecule formation @xcite , etc . in the limit of low collision energies",
    ", theory predicts in the lowest order approximation a flat energy dependence of the muon transfer rate @xcite , while more refined calculations show that for some gases its value may vary by up to an order of magnitude for collision energies below 1  ev @xcite . some experimental data , e.g. , on transfer to sulfur @xcite , consist of a single data point , the average rate of muon transfer at certain pressure and temperature , obtained as the disappearance rate of muonic hydrogen atoms and determined from the time distribution of the events of de - excitation of the muonic atoms of the heavier gas . in the case of oxygen @xcite , argon @xcite and neon @xcite , however , the time distributions of these events clearly display two different time ranges with substantially different disappearance exponents for the hot and the thermalized atoms .",
    "this was interpreted as an evidence for a non - flat energy dependence of the muon transfer rate @xcite , and a step - function was introduced to describe qualitatively the energy dependence of the transfer rate to oxygen , argon and neon .",
    "the earlier estimates of the efficiency of the experimental method in @xcite were obtained using this step - function approximation .",
    "its accuracy , however , is far from what is needed for the planning and optimization of the muonic hydrogen hyperfine experiment because the contribution from the atoms with energies in the whole epithermal range is averaged over their energy distribution and is accounted for with a single parameter  the disappearance slope for the `` unexpected delayed '' events  @xcite  which incorporates the uncertainties due to the strongly model - dependent energy distribution of the epithermal atoms @xcite . to solve the problem",
    ", we propose to perform instead a series of measurements of the muon transfer rate from _",
    "thermalized muonic hydrogen atoms _ at different temperatures in an as broad as possible temperature range .",
    "the numerical technique of investigating the energy dependence of the muon transfer rate , which is presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : rate ] , relies substantially on the assumption that the muonic hydrogen atoms are thermalized and their energy distribution  the maxwell - boltzmann distribution  contains no uncertainties .",
    "our study in sect .",
    "[ sect : processes ] is also focused on the processes in a mixture of hydrogen and higher - z gases at thermal equilibrium .",
    "when slowed down and stopped in a mixture of hydrogen and higher - z gases , a negative muon is captured by the coulomb field of the nuclei and forms exotic muonic atoms in which one ( or more ) of the electrons are ejected and replaced by the muon .",
    "we do not consider here the processes of muon capture in an excited state of the exotic atom and the subsequent de - excitation by competing auger and radiative transitions and in non - elastic collisions because for the hydrogen target densities of interest ( pressures above 10  atm at room temperature ) the whole cascade down to the ground @xmath5 state takes no more than about 1  ns .",
    "this choice of the target density is determined by the specific features of the available gas containers : simulations ( to be reported elsewhere ) with the fluka code  @xcite have shown that too few muons are stopped in the target at lower densities .",
    "so , to a good approximation , the description of the history of a muonic atom can start from the ground @xmath5 state .    in the general case ( when the target gas is a natural mixture of hydrogen and deuterium ) , the following processes take place : elastic scattering of the muonic atoms , spin - flip , muon exchange between the hydrogen isotopes , and rotational - vibrational transitions in target molecules ; formation of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 molecules ; nuclear fusion in @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; nuclear muon capture ; muon decay , and muon transfer from muonic hydrogen atoms to atomic states of higher - z elements .",
    "the part of muons that are transferred to muonic deuterium at natural deuterium concentration is small and has little impact on the process of muon transfer to higher - z nuclei @xcite ; nuclear fusion therefore can also be neglected .",
    "the muons that are captured in muonic molecules drop out of the sequence of processes leading to transfer to higher - z gases ; since muonic molecule formation @xcite is much slower that muon transfer even at low admixture gas concentration ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : transfer ] ) it will not be taken into account .",
    "as for the muons directly captured in muonic atoms of the higher - z admixture gas , their fast cascade de - excitation produces prompt x - rays that can be clearly distinguished from the delayed x - rays that follow the transfer of the muon from @xmath2 . with all this in mind , we restrict our consideration to the following subset of processes :    1 .",
    "thermalization of the muonic hydrogen atoms via elastic scattering of @xmath2 by h@xmath0 molecules ; 2 .",
    "depolarization of the muonic hydrogen atoms in spin - flip scattering by h@xmath0 molecules ; 3 .",
    "muon transfer from the hydrogen to higher - z muonic atom ; 4 .",
    "disappearance of the muon by either a muon decay or nuclear muon capture .",
    "part of the energy released in the cascade de - excitation of @xmath2 atoms is transformed into kinetic energy of the latter , and the initial energy distribution in the ground @xmath5 state is spread over a broad interval up to the kev range @xcite , with the para ( @xmath9 ) and ortho ( @xmath10 ) spin states populated statistically .",
    "a phenomenological distribution of the initial kinetic energy that has given good results in simulations of preceding experiments is the sum of two maxwellian distribution density , one corresponding to the target gas temperature , and another one with mean energy of 20  ev ; it has been used in the present work too .",
    "thermalization and depolarization occur in elastic and spin - flip scattering with the surrounding hydrogen and higher - z atoms and molecules .",
    "the energy loss in collisions with the light h@xmath0 is the main mechanism of thermalization , so that the rate of thermalization is little sensitive to the admixture concentration and depends only on the hydrogen density @xmath11 ( or pressure @xmath12 ) and  through the molecular cross sections  on the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the same holds for the rate of depolarization .",
