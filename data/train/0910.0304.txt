    "the warm ionized medium ( wim ) is one of the major gas components of our galaxy .",
    "it is a diffuse ionized gas with temperature @xmath1 k , scale height @xmath2 kpc , and average density @xmath3 @xmath4 , and occupies approximately 20% of the volume of the disk in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measured width of the h@xmath5 line from the wim is in the range of 15 to 50 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that the wim is in a turbulent state ( see below ) . assuming that the typical width of h@xmath5 line and temperature are 30 km s@xmath6 and 8000 k , respectively , the non - thermal",
    ", turbulent velocity would be about 13 km s@xmath6 , as is calculated , for instance , with equation ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "so the sonic mach number of turbulent motions , @xmath7 , would be around unity in the wim .",
    "it is smaller than @xmath7 of the cold neutral medium , which is a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath7 of molecular clouds , which is @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best evidence for turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) which includes the wim comes from the power spectrum presented in @xcite .",
    "it is a composite power spectrum of electron density collected from observations of velocity fluctuations of the interstellar gas , rotation measures ( rm ) , dispersion measures ( dm ) , interstellar scintillations , and others .",
    "the spectrum covers the spatial range of @xmath9 cm , and remarkably the whole spectrum is fitted to the power spectrum of kolmogorov turbulence with slope @xmath10 . in addition , it has been recently reported that the h@xmath5 emission measure for the wim @xcite and the densities of the diffuse ionized gas and the diffuse atomic gas @xcite follow the lognormal distribution .",
    "the lognormality in density ( or column density ) distributions can be regarded as another signature of turbulence in the wim ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field that is pervasive in the galaxy plays an important role in the dynamics of the ism , star formation , acceleration of cosmic rays , etc .",
    "it has the energy density comparable to those of turbulence and cosmic rays , as well as the thermal energy density @xcite .",
    "the information on the field has been obtained through observations of zeeman splitting , polarized thermal emission from dust , optical starlight polarization , radio synchrotron emission , and the faraday rotation of polarized radio sources ( see , * ? ? ? * for a review ) . of them",
    ", the last method can be used to study the magnetic field in ionized media such as the wim .",
    "it estimates the mean strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight , weighted with the electron density @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the angle between @xmath15 and the line of sight .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have used the rms and dms of pulsars to reproduce the large - scale magnetic field of our galaxy .",
    "recently , the distributions of rms along many contiguous lines of sight have been obtained in multi - frequency polarimetric observations of the diffuse galactic synchrotron background @xcite and the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "while the peak in the frequency distribution of the rms reflects the regular component of the magnetic field , the spread should reflect the turbulent component .",
    "this means that if the distribution of rms is observed , the spread provides another way to quantify the magnetic field in turbulent ionized media such as the wim .    motivated by the importance of rm in the study of the magnetic field in the wim , in this paper we study rm in turbulent media with the rms mach number of unity",
    "simulations are outlined in section 2 .",
    "results are presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "we performed three - dimensional simulations of isothermal , compressible , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , using a code based on the total variation diminishing scheme @xcite .",
    "the fact that the temperature of the wim is in a relatively narrow range of 6000 - 10000 k @xcite would justify the assumption of isothermality .",
    "there are two parameters in our simulations : the root - mean - square ( rms ) sonic mach number , @xmath7 , and the initial plasma beta value , @xmath16 .",
    "hereafter , the subscript `` 0 '' is used to denote the initial values .",
    "the first parameter indicates the level of turbulence . in this paper , we focus on the turbulence with the rms mach number of unity , and so set @xmath17 .",
    "the second parameter tells the strength of the initially uniform magnetic field , or the regular field , @xmath18 . in order to explore the effect of regular field",
    ", we varied the value of @xmath16 from 0.1 , 1 , 10 , to 100 . if we take 8000 k and 0.03 @xmath4 as the representative values of the temperature and electron density , assuming that hydrogen is completely ionized , helium is neutral , and the number ratio of hydrogen to helium is 0.1 , we have @xmath19 g .",
    "so the initial magnetic field strength in our simulations corresponds to 4.1 , 1.3 , 0.41 , 0.13 @xmath20 g for @xmath16 = 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "simulations were started with @xmath18 along the @xmath21-direction in a uniform medium of density , @xmath22 .",
    "the grid of @xmath23 zones was used for the periodic computational box of size @xmath24 .",
    "turbulence was driven with the recipe in @xcite and @xcite ; velocity perturbations were drawn from a gaussian random field determined by the top - hat power distribution in a narrow wavenumber range of @xmath25 , and added at every @xmath26 .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations was tuned in such a way that @xmath27 became nearly unity at saturation . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath29 is the rms velocity of the resultant turbulent flow . in simulations",
    "@xmath29 initially increased and became saturated at @xmath30 , and we ran the simulations up to @xmath31 , two sound crossing times . at saturation ,",
    "the average strength of magnetic field reached 4.2 , 1.45 , 0.73 , and 0.51 @xmath20 g for @xmath16 = 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "the amplification factor was larger for the simulations with larger @xmath16 or weaker @xmath18 .",
    "we first check whether @xmath34 in equation ( 1 ) correctly reproduces the unbiased strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "that is true , only if there is no correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath11 ( or the gas density @xmath33 ) . if the correlation is positive , @xmath34 in equation ( 1 ) overestimates the magnetic field strength , while if negative , it underestimates the strength .",
    "it is known from observations @xcite and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that in the highly compressible , supersonic , molecular cloud environment , the magnetic pressure ( or @xmath32 ) and the gas pressure ( or @xmath33 in isothermal gas ) are positively correlated .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , reported a weak negative correlation for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( their model 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 in our simulations .",
    "the nearly circular shape of contour lines indicates weak correlation for @xmath17 . to quantify it , we calculated the correlation coefficient @xmath37^{1/2 } \\left[\\sigma_{i , j , k}(\\rho_{i , j , k}-\\bar \\rho)^2\\right]^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the average values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 at the end of simulations were 0.01 , -0.12 , -0.06 , and 0.16 for @xmath16=0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "relatively small values of @xmath40 confirm that the correlation is weak for @xmath17 , regardless of @xmath16 .",
    "weak correlation means that the rm field in equation ( 1 ) should correctly represent the true magnetic field . to test it ,",
    "we compare the strengths of two fields in figure 2 ; the frequency distributions of the true mean strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight ( presented with solid lines ) and the magnetic field strength calculated with equation ( 1 ) ( presented with dotted lines ) coincide quite well .",
    "so we argue that the systematic bias , due to a correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath11 , in the estimation of magnetic field strength with rm would be insignificant in the turbulent media with @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite pointed that the discrepancy in the strengths of the regular galactic magnetic field estimated with rm and synchrotron emissivity could be reconciled , if the correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath11 is negative in the wim and so the rm field was underestimated .",
    "@xcite postulated the pressure equilibrium , which results in the negative correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if the pressure equilibrium is maintained , the combined pressure of gas and magnetic field , @xmath41 , should exhibit a narrow distribution .",
    "figure 3 shows the frequency distribution of @xmath42 .",
    "our simulations show broad distributions rather than peaked distributions .",
    "that is , our results do not support the prediction of @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that we considered only the turbulent media with the rms mach number @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", the wim may have @xmath7 which is not exactly unity .",
    "so we need to further investigate turbulent media with @xmath43 , before we exclude the postulation of @xcite . we leave it as a future work .",
    "we then look at the frequency distribution of rms . figure 4 shows the probability distribution of rm/@xmath44 for different @xmath16 s as well as for different @xmath14 s . here , @xmath0 is the average value of rms .",
    "( the distribution was also calculated for @xmath45 , but not shown in the figure for clarity .",
    "the distribution for @xmath45 is used in figure 5 . )",
    "the fit to the gaussian is also shown . a noticeable point in the figure",
    "is that the distribution of rm/@xmath0 is very well fitted to the gaussian .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is between 0.89 and 0.99 .",
    ", as an indicator of goodness - of - fit , where @xmath46 if the fit is perfect and @xmath47 if the fit is less perfect .",
    "] this result is consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "they took the multi - frequency polarimetric images of diffuse radio synchrotron backgrounds in the constellation auriga and horologium , and obtained rm maps .",
    "the distribution of the observed rms is also fitted to the gaussian .",
    "another noticeable point in figure 4 is that the distribution is more widely spread for larger @xmath16 and larger @xmath14 .",
    "it hints at a possible correlation between the spread in the distribution of rm/@xmath0 with the strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "figure 5 shows the relation between the full width at half maximum , @xmath48 , of the distribution of rm/@xmath0 shown in figure 4 and the strength of the regular field along the line of sight , @xmath49 .",
    "the best fit for the relation are mostly above the fitting line , while the black symbols for @xmath50 are mostly below the line .",
    "this tells that @xmath16 may enter the relation as a secondary , but less prominent , parameter . ]",
    "is @xmath51 note that the relation is for @xmath52 k and @xmath53 @xmath4 as the representative values of the temperature and electron density , and scales as @xmath54 for other values of @xmath55 and @xmath11 . the empirical relation in ( 3 ) may provide a handy way to quantify the strength of the regular field along the line of sight in regions where",
    "the map of rms has been obtained along many contiguous lines of sight with the multi - frequency polarimetric observations ( see introduction ) .",
    "the accompanying map of dms is not necessary for it .",
    "the estimation of magnetic field strength with the relation in ( 3 ) , however , should be done with caution because of its limitations : first , the relation is valid only for @xmath56 .",
    "second , no stratification of gas and magnetic field was assumed , which is apparent in the polarization maps of a larger area of our galaxy .",
    "third , no source emitting polarized light in the medium between background polarized continua and us was considered .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the broadening of the width of rm distribution is due to fluctuating magnetized gas .",
    "we can easily expect that , for a given regular field , the width would be larger if the rms mach number , @xmath7 , is larger .",
    "so @xmath48 should be a function of not only @xmath57 but also @xmath7 . in order to quantify the relation of @xmath48 versus @xmath57 and @xmath7 , we need simulations that cover the parameter space of @xmath16 and @xmath7 .",
    "low - resolution simulations with @xmath58 and 2.0 show that the probability distribution of rm/@xmath0 is still fitted to the gaussian , and @xmath48 can differ by a factor of two to three if @xmath7 differs by a factor of two .",
    "we leave the report of the @xmath43 results , including the correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , from high - resolution simulations as a future work .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to apply the relation in ( 3 ) to rm observations in the wim , assuming @xmath17 there .",
    "for instance , from the figures of the frequency distribution of rms in auriga and horologium in @xcite , we read @xmath59 and 7 , and get @xmath60 and 0.1 @xmath20 g for auriga and horologium , respectively ( if @xmath61 @xmath4 is used as in @xcite ) .",
    "these are close to , but somewhat larger than , the values estimated in @xcite , @xmath62 and 0.085 @xmath20 g , respectively .",
    "however , by considering the limitations of the relation in ( 3 ) and the uncertainty in the values of @xmath48 which we read from figures , we regard the agreement to be fair .    currently the number of the synchrotron backgrounds , which can be used for the observation of rm maps , is still limited due to the relatively low sensitivity of present - day radio telescopes . however",
    ", the new - generation radio telescopes , such as lofar ( low frequency array ) and ska ( square kilometer array ) with much higher sensitivity , will certainly provide rm maps in much larger portions of the sky .",
    "then , the relation like the one in ( 3 ) will become a useful diagnosis .",
