    "there has been an attempt recently to describe routing in computer networks by modeling the traffic as a set of shortest paths in non - euclidean space .",
    "the comparison has deep qualitative significance .",
    "one of the non - euclidean spaces considered is a hyperbolic plane . in a hyperbolic plane ,",
    "paths between two points are cheaper the closer they are to the center , and so all shortest paths arc towards the center as they travel . in computer networks ,",
    "bits of information that need to travel far will be passed from regional hubs up to backbone routers , a subnetwork designed to route a large volume of traffic cheaply across long distances .",
    "each successive stage up is then considered closer to the `` logical center '' of the network .",
    "but in what tangible ways is this metaphor useful ?",
    "shavitt and tankel @xcite , and later bogu , papadopoulos , and krioukov @xcite , described a heuristic method to map vertices of a computer network into a @xmath0-dimensional hyperbolic space .",
    "they started with placing vertices with highest degree ( a parameter known to correlate with being in the backbone ) at the center of the hyperbolic space , and then moving on to lower degree vertices placed at larger radii from the center and at an angle that minimizes the distance to adjacent vertices .",
    "the goal of the project was to see if such a mapping of the graph interactions between telecommunication companies to a hyperbolic space could be used to efficiently route internet traffic via the natural shortest path derived from the geometric space .",
    "the experiment was a success .",
    "another example of using a curved space to solve a problem is the scheme by gavoille and ly @xcite for distance - labeling networks .",
    "after the appearance of these applications various types of curved spaces have been presented as alternative methods to model big data or big networks .",
    "most of these spaces have a parameter , usually called the curvature of the space .",
    "proposed applications of this line of thinking include community detection @xcite , network security @xcite @xcite , quantum information @xcite , influence in regulatory networks @xcite , graph mining @xcite , and connectivity of sensor networks @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the application of describing the congestion in a network . suggested models of networks that incorporate congestion have involved hyperbolic spaces @xcite , curved @xmath0-manifolds @xcite , or fixed points in the automorphism group of the graph @xcite .",
    "traffic on a computer network is modeled using _ uniformly distributed demand_. in this paper we assume all of our graphs are connected .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the number of shortest paths from @xmath2 to @xmath3 in @xmath4 , and @xmath5 denote the number of shortest paths from @xmath2 to @xmath3 that use @xmath6 .",
    "the demand on a vertex @xmath6 is defined to be @xmath7 .",
    "the _ betweenness _ of @xmath6 is @xmath8 ; we choose the less - common notation of demand because it better illustrates asymptotic behavior . in most real world",
    "networks the average distance between two vertices is small @xcite , and therefore the average amount of demand on a vertex is approximately @xmath9 for some constant @xmath10 .",
    "a _ congested _ network is then a network with a skewed distribution of demand ; in the extremal case we should see a non - empty set of vertices with demand at least @xmath11 for some constant @xmath12 .",
    "we will investigate several of the spaces proposed to model congested graphs , and whether or not there is any relation between the curvature parameter and the level of congestion .",
    "our results will show that the only parameter of interest is gromov s @xmath13-hyperbolic curvature .",
    "some work investigating the implication of gromov s work on graphs has already been done : the introduction to @xcite contains an excellent survey on results characterizing graphs with small hyperbolicity , and inequalities have been constructed relating hyperbolicity to the independence and dominating numbers @xcite .",
    "hyperbolicity has also been used to construct random networks that feature scale free degree distributions @xcite and tunable clustering coefficients @xcite .",
    "the first half of this paper is a thorough analysis of how gromov s work applies to congestion in networks .",
    "the most common application of gromov s work to network analysis is that for any @xmath13-hyperbolic graph @xmath4 there is a map @xmath14 from the vertex set to a tree @xmath15 such that for all @xmath16 @xmath17 this result , and that trees are @xmath18-hyperbolic , inspires the intuition `` @xmath13-hyperbolic graphs ( for small @xmath13 ) are tree - like . ''",
    "this intuition can be misleading , as our tree - like graphs do not always behave like trees .",
    "for example , every tree with @xmath19 vertices will have a vertex with demand at least @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath21 is also @xmath18-hyperbolic , and has the least amount of congestion among all graphs with @xmath19 vertices .",
    "a second example is a cycle @xmath22 , which is @xmath23-hyperbolic , and therefore not hyperbolic at all as @xmath24 .",
    "however , every vertex in @xmath22 has demand @xmath25 .    in the first example above",
    ", the distance approximating tree @xmath15 for @xmath21 is a star , where each edge has cost @xmath26 and each vertex of @xmath4 maps to a leaf .",
    "therefore the only vertex with non - trivial demand in @xmath15 is not associated with a vertex of @xmath4 at all . in the second example , the distance approximating tree of @xmath22 is a path with vertex set in order @xmath27 . for any vertex @xmath28 ,",
    "gromov s theorem constructs a map @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "we see that the link between @xmath13-hyperbolic curvature and congestion has less to do with @xmath13 and more to do with the distance approximating tree .",
    "it is then a coy turn of events that we will demonstrate a rigorous connection between congestion and hyperbolic curvature , and we will do it without reference to distance approximating trees .",
    "we will also investigate other parameters related to distance approximating trees , such as tree - length @xcite and the length of the largest induced cycle @xcite , even though there has been no previously reported relation to congestion in a network .",
    "distance approximating trees are a subject of their own interest , with applications to routing schemes @xcite , evolutionary trees @xcite , graph mining @xcite , computational geometry @xcite , and graph visualization @xcite .",
    "we will show that while the methods change drastically , gromov s method to generate a distance approximating tree has re - appeared multiple times . for a survey of other related parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we will translate a portion of gromov s seminal work @xcite into the language of graph theory .",
    "we will focus on the distance approximating tree , and using additional work show that the tree produced by gromov s work is in fact a layering tree . in section 3",
    "we will investigate other parameters that imply the existence of a distance approximating tree with bounded error , and show relations between those parameters and @xmath13-hyperbolicity . in section 4 we will consider the algorithmic problem of determining the value of @xmath13 for a given graph . in section 5",
    "we will prove a relationship between hyperbolicity and congestion .",
    "in the second half of this paper we will briefly discuss the other proposed geometric models for inferring information about congestion .",
    "some of these models are built on an intuitive understanding that falls apart as we rigorously analyze them .",
    "others are models designed to overcome the limitations of gromov s hyperbolicity - but are done in such a way that all of the advantages are lost .",
    "sections 6 and 7 will investigate measures loosely based on the concept of the center of rotation as a nexus for where the highest levels of congestion in a network would be located . in section 8 we will analyze the level of congestion in the euclidean grid , which has been held up as the standard non - hyperbolic graph . in section 9",
    "we will consider scaled versions of gromov s hyperbolicity .",
    "our first set of results concern the relationship between gromov hyperbolicity , thin triangles , and slim triangles .",

    "<S> we also show that buneman s distance approximating tree is the best possible up to a constant both additively and multiplicatively . </S>"
