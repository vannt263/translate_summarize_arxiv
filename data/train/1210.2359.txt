    "@xcite used the riemann - hilbert approach to investigate the asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials with respect to a general weight function .",

    "moreover , their results are more local in nature ; that is , one needs more asymptotic formulas to describe the behavior of these polynomials in the complex plane .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study uniform asymptotic behavior of the hahn polynomials as @xmath34 , when the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fixed and the ratio @xmath35 is a constant @xmath36 .",
    "our approach is based on a modified version of the riemann - hilbert method introduced by deift and zhou @xcite .",
    "this version has been used successfully to obtain globally uniform asymptotic expansions of several discrete orthogonal polynomials ; see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the presentation of this paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 , we review some preliminaries , including weak asymptotics of the zero distribution and the formulation of the basic interpolation problem @xmath37 . in section 3 , we transform this interpolation problem into an equivalent riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) . in section 4 ,",

    "the final results are presented in sections 6 and 7 , where we divide the whole complex plane into three regions and in each region we derive a uniformly asymptotic formula . as a special case of our result , we give in section 8 the asymptotic formula of @xmath0 for fixed values of @xmath28 .",
