    "sunspots rotate about 4% faster than the solar surface plasma at all latitudes .",
    "helioseismology reveals a corresponding maximum of the angular velocity rather close to the surface , as shown in fig .",
    "such a clear subrotation of the outermost layer of the convection zone is easiest understood as the result of angular momentum conservation of fluid elements with purely radial motions . in this domain of the solar convection zone , however , the gas motion is predominantly horizontal .",
    "fluctuating fields with dominant horizontal intensity should simply produce superrotation rather than the observed subrotation ( cf .",
    "rdiger 1989 )    from the proper motions of sunspot groups , the faster of which tend to move toward the equator , ward ( 1965 ) found the positive value of @xmath2 ( deg / day)@xmath3 m@xmath4/s@xmath4 for the corresponding horizontal cross correlation on the northern hemisphere .",
    "more recent observations found smaller but always positive values ( nesme - ribes , ferreira , & vince 1993 ) .",
    "the mean motion of a turbulent fluid is governed by the reynolds equation , @xmath5 =   - \\nabla \\cdot ( \\rho q )         - \\nabla p + \\rho { \\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the correlation tensor of the velocity fluctuations , @xmath7 .",
    "two components of the correlation tensor are relevant for the transport of angular momentum : @xmath8 where is the eddy viscosity , @xmath9 the rotation rate , v and h are dimensionless functions , and @xmath10 the turbulence intensity .",
    "the eddy viscosity and the turbulence intensity are related through @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "[ qrf ] and [ qtf ] , the terms containing describe the usual eddy viscosity part of the reynolds stress while the non - diffusive terms containing @xmath12 represent the @xmath13-effect , which drives the differential rotation .    to compute the rotation pattern ,",
    "the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are needed .",
    "while the intensity @xmath12 can be estimated from the convective velocity , as computed by mixing - length theory , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 have to be determined separately .",
    "kitchatinov & rdiger ( 1993 ) , and kitchatinov , pipin , & rdiger ( 1994 ) derived approximations using the second order approximation . both the eddy viscosity and",
    "the @xmath13 coefficients are functions of the coriolis number , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the convective turnover time and @xmath19 the rotation period .",
    "for very slow rotation , @xmath20 , angular momentum is transported outwards , and there is no horizontal @xmath13 effect . for rapid rotation ,",
    "the horizontal flux of angular momentum becomes dominant .",
    "the radial transport vanishes in the equatorial region and is negative at the poles .",
    "figure [ oms ] shows the variation of the coriolis number with radius in the bulk of the solar convection zone , as computed with the model of kker & stix ( 2001 ) . the coriolis number is greater than unity in the bulk of the convection zone , but smaller in the granulation and supergranulation layers .",
    "thus , by comparing the time scales of rotation and convection , we find that the bulk of the solar convection zone is rapidly rotating , while the uppermost layers are in a state of slow rotation .",
    "the rotation laws derived with the expressions from kitchatinov & rdiger ( 1993 ) , and kitchatinov , pipin , & rdiger ( 1994 ) for the reynolds stress reproduce the observations remarkably well in the bulk of the convection zone , but lack the negative radial shear in the supergranulation layer ( kker , rdiger , & kitchatinov 1993 , kitchatinov & rdiger 1995 , kker & stix 2001 ) .",
    "we therefore follow a different approach to determine the parameters of the stress tensor in the uppermost part of the convection zone .",
    "chan ( 2001 ) carried out 3d rhd simulations of rotating convection in f - planes .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath15 and @xmath16 coefficients as function of the colatitude as derived from the simulations .",
    "the horizontal component shows a strong peak at the equator , while the vertical angular momentum transport is strongest at the poles .",
    "contrary to the predictions of kitchatinov & rdiger ( 1993 ) for slowly rotating convection , the radial transport of angular momentum is directed inwards , and strongest close to the poles rather than at the equator .",
    "the horizontal transport exceeds the radial , and is strongly concentrated at low latitudes .",
    "we solve the reynolds equation using a time - explicit finite difference method for the outer 5% of the solar convection zone with the reynolds stress as described above .",
    "as the horizontal shear is mainly generated in the bulk of the convection zone which has been excluded from the computations , we require @xmath21 at the lower boundary .",
    "the upper boundary is assumed stress - free , i.e. @xmath22 .    in eqs .",
    "[ qrf ] and [ qtf ] , the intensity , @xmath12 appears in the diffusive as well as in the non - diffusive part of the stress tensor .",
    "it therefore has no influence on the solution , which is stationary , but merely determines the time scale on which perturbations are damped .",
    "fixing the average rotation period to 28 d , the only free parameter is the viscosity parameter @xmath14 , which is varied between 0 and 1 to get the best possible agreement between the computed and the observed rotation laws .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the rotation pattern for three different values of @xmath14 .",
    "while , due to the lower boundary condition , there are no significant differences in the latitudinal shear , the radial shear strongly varies .",
    "comparison with the observed profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the @xmath23 case approximately matches the observations , while the @xmath24 case produces too much , and the @xmath25 case not enough shear .",
    "we conclude that @xmath23 is the appropriate choice .      in figure [ fig5 ] , the theoretical ward profile , @xmath26 of the surface rotation law",
    "is shown for @xmath27 . at low latitudes ,",
    "the sign is positive in the northern and negative in the southern hemisphere . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the sign is negative in the northern and positive in the southern hemisphere . in the equatorial region ,",
    "the amplitude is roughly the same as that observed by ward ( 1965 ) , and the signs agree , too . with a typical value of 200 m / s for the convection velocity in the supergranulation layer , a rotation rate @xmath28 , and @xmath23",
    ", we find @xmath29 for the eddy viscosity .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude larger than the value of @xmath30 @xmath1/s derived for the magnetic diffusivity from sunspot decay . for the ratio between viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath31 we thus fund a value as large as 150 .",
