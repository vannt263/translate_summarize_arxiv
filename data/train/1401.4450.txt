    "quantum spin chains in one dimension are of interest both from theoretical and experimental perspectives .",
    "the prototypical spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model is integrable and its eigenstates can be obtained exactly using bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "moreover , the development of the algebraic bethe ansatz ( see @xcite ) gave access to the computation of experimentally relevant quantities such as dynamical spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "in particular , the existence of a determinant representation of the scalar product between bethe states @xcite and of matrix elements of local operators @xcite opens the way towards an explicit summation of spectral representations for such correlators .",
    "recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments for the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain  @xcite have displayed very good comparison with theoretical predictions following from algebraic bethe ansatz on both the spinon structure of the low - lying excitations and dynamical correlations .",
    "the unifying view of integrable models afforded by the algebraic bethe ansatz means that such methods can be extended to other models . in the context of spin chains , a generalisation of the heisenberg model to integrable chains of higher spin is possible through the fusion of r - matrices  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the computation of dynamical correlation functions for the heisenberg model to the integrable spin-@xmath2 case , namely to the babujan - takhtajan @xcite bilinear - biquadratic model ( see equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonianbt ] ) below ) .    a straightforward generalisation of the heisenberg ( _ i.e. _ strictly bilinear ) model to higher spin leads to a model with finite haldane gap  @xcite for integer spin , while it remains gapless for half - integer spin . in both cases",
    "the heisenberg model is not integrable away from spin-@xmath1 , and the simplest higher - spin extensions consider a hamiltonian which is polynomial in the nearest - neighbour interaction terms .",
    "for the first possible generalisation of the heisenberg chain to spin-@xmath2 , a biquadratic nearest - neighbour interaction term in the hamiltonian can be added , which for different ratios between the coefficients of the bilinear and biquadratic terms leads to a rich phase diagram full of interesting physical properties  @xcite .",
    "the general bilinear - biquadratic spin-@xmath2 chain hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 .",
    "\\label{eq : hamiltonianalpha}\\ ] ] a complete overview of the phase diagram of the bilinear - biquadratic spin-@xmath2 hamiltonian , including the presence of a magnetic field , is given in  @xcite .",
    "only a few exactly solvable points are identifiable . regarding the notion of exact solvability , a point worth mentioning in the phase diagram at @xmath4",
    "is known as the aklt - model  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of this model is exactly expressed as a valence bond solid .",
    "however , this model is not bethe ansatz - solvable , so its exact spectrum and correlations are out of reach .    the aforementioned r - matrix fusion procedure within the framework of the algebraic bethe ansatz yields the su(@xmath5)-symmetric integrable higher spin chains . for the specific case of a spin-@xmath2 chain ,",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is the babujan - takhtajan model with @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{eq : hamiltonianbt}\\ ] ] it is worth mentioning that , by means of the nested bethe ansatz , the eigenstates of another integrable spin-@xmath2 model with @xmath8 can be constructed .",
    "this su(3)-symmetric chain is known as the uimin - lai - sutherland model@xcite .",
    "there have been recent developments on the computation of scalar products between bethe states for su(3 ) models  @xcite , but a full determinant representation similar to the one existing in the su(2 ) case has not yet been found .",
    "the procedure of the computation of dynamical correlation functions based on the algebraic bethe ansatz can thus only be extended to the spin-@xmath2 chain for the babujan - takhtajan model at this point .",
    "the bethe equations for higher integrable spin-@xmath9 chains have been derived by the fusion of r - matrices .",
    "however , the derivation might as well be performed using the coordinate bethe ansatz  @xcite , following the original derivation of the bethe equations  @xcite for the heisenberg model by imposing plane wave solutions and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the bethe equations for the spin-@xmath9 case are given by @xmath10 where each set of roots @xmath11 specifies an eigenstate of the model .",
    "the length of the spin chain is denoted by @xmath12 , while @xmath13 denotes the number of downturned spins as compared to the fully polarised reference state @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the energy of a bethe state is given by @xmath15    the hamiltonians corresponding to the bethe equations for a spin-@xmath9 chain are polynomials of degree @xmath16 in the nearest neighbour interaction between spins  @xcite .",
    "the babujan - takhtajan model ( [ eq : hamiltonianbt ] ) is thus the first step above the heisenberg model in this hierarchy .",
    "while the eigenstates of the model are in principle obtained by means of the bethe ansatz , solving for the roots of the bethe equations for each state is still a highly non - trivial task .",
    "expressions for correlation functions of integrable higher spin chains for the isotropic as well as the anisotropic chain at both zero and finite temperature have been obtained by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz , fusion and/or multiple integral representations @xcite , avoiding the necessity of having to deal with the roots of the bethe equations explicitly . however ,",
    "these approaches can not be applied to the derivation of dynamical correlation functions , which are of great importance from a physical point of view and which we will concentrate on here .",
    "some properties of the solutions of the bethe equations might be considered in advance .",
    "if the set of bethe roots @xmath17 solves the bethe equations , then it is straightforward to see that the set @xmath18 must also be a valid solution by considering the complex conjugated version of the bethe equations .",
    "moreover , it is possible to prove a stronger statement  @xcite that the set of roots solving the bethe equations have the feature of being self conjugate , @xmath19 .",
    "this important property boils down to the fact that the bethe roots organise themselves symmetrically around the real axis of the complex rapidity plane .",
    "in general for the thermodynamic limit , the solutions are furthermore conjectured to group themselves in structures called strings , sharing a common real part , but separated in the imaginary direction by @xmath20 .",
    "string solutions of length larger then one are then to be interpreted as bound states of local spin lowering operators acting on the reference state of the spin chain . for finite size",
    ", the string hypothesis technically fails and one encounters deviations from the assumed perfect string patterns .",
    "the only constraint on the solutions is its self conjugacy , yielding a picture of deformed strings as a result of the finite size .",
    "the deviations of the string solutions regularise the divergent prefactors and determinants arising in the matrix element expressions .    for the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model , the antiferromagnetic ground state consists of real rapidities only , while the low - lying excitations may contain a small number of strings .",
    "moreover , deviations of single two - strings are in general ( at least at finite field ) exponentially suppressed in system size , which allows for not taking deviations into account in the numerical solution procedure of the bethe equations and computation of matrix elements .",
    "the expressions for the matrix elements can be rewritten for string solutions by rearranging the determinants and cancelling the divergent terms among each other . for the majority of purposes and in most cases",
    "it is therefore sufficient for high precision computations to neglect string deviations in the spin-@xmath1 model .",
    "in contrast to the spin-@xmath1 antiferromagnetic ground state containing only real rapidities , the ground state of the spin-@xmath2 babujan - takhtajan chain is conjectured to consist solely out of two - strings  @xcite .",
    "the bilinear term of the hamiltonian favours antiparallel ordering of neighbouring spins , while the biquadratic term lowers the energy when neighbouring spins are ordered either parallel or antiparallel . altogether",
    "this will result in antiparallel ordering in the ground state , which can be approximated by acting twice with a spin lowering operator on every other site .",
    "this locally bound state of two down spins gives a good intuition as to why the ground state bethe ansatz solution is a sea of two - strings .",
    "the low - lying excited states can subsequently be realised by breaking up one or more two - strings into real rapidties or higher strings .",
    "most importantly , a thermodynamic number of two - strings is present in the spin-@xmath2 ground state , and the corresponding string deviations are not exponentially vanishing with respect to system size  @xcite . a proper description of the string structure in the bethe states as well as the behaviour of string deviations are an essential part of our computation , due to the presence of strings in both the ground state and the low - lying excited states .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present a computation of the dynamical structure factor of the babujan - takhtajan spin-@xmath2 chain , following the numerical strategy introduced for the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model  @xcite , while taking the more involved difficulties of handling string deviations for the spin-@xmath2 case into account .",
    "the dynamical structure factor is defined as the fourier transform of the connected spin - spin correlation function @xmath21 from the first to the second line we switch to the lehmann representation by making use of a resolution of the identity @xmath22 to obtain a sum over intermediate states .",
    "for the zero temperature dynamical structure factor , the expectation value with respect to the ground state should be taken .",
    "furthermore , as we take the connected correlator , the ground state is excluded from the sum over intermediate states .",
    "one can distinguish between the dynamical structure factor in the transverse ( @xmath23 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath24 ) direction of the spin chain , although this distinction is immaterial in the zero - field isotropic case we consider here . besides a careful analysis and proper calculation of the deviated string solutions , the computation of the dynamical structure factor relies on determinant representations for matrix element expressions obtained for higher spin chains  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way .",
    "the next section will provide an overview of the structure of the bethe ansatz solutions for the babujan - tahktajan spin-@xmath2 chain , while the third section will introduce the parametrisation and method to obtain the roots of the bethe equations including string deviations .",
    "section 4 will elaborate on the matrix element expressions for spin-@xmath2 , while the results will be given in section 5 .",
    "in order to investigate the structure of the eigenstates of the higher spin chains , it is more convenient to introduce the logarithm of the bethe equations .",
    "the logarithmic branches will provide for quantum numbers which specify the states .",
    "the logarithmic bethe equations for the integrable spin-@xmath9 chain are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the bethe quantum numbers @xmath27 are integers for @xmath28 odd and half - odd integers for @xmath28 even . due to the string structure of the solutions , it is a non - trivial task to determine the set of possible configurations of bethe quantum numbers . for a pair of complex conjugate roots @xmath29 where @xmath30 is assumed to be located in the upper half part of the complex plane , we proceed to analyse the difference between the corresponding quantum numbers by subtracting the bethe equations for both conjugate roots .",
    "similar to the spin-@xmath1 case  @xcite , the branch cuts of the inverse tangent of the conjugate root has to be taken into account properly , @xmath31 for @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 elsewhere .",
    "furthermore we restrict to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , implying that the self scattering term between the conjugate roots yields the only non - zero branch cut of the difference between the corresponding bethe equations , resulting in @xmath36 more elaborate examples where strings are centered at the origin or additionally have coinciding string centers will be encountered within the low - lying excitation spectrum of the spin-@xmath2 chain .",
    "the behaviour of the quantum numbers in these cases will be treated in section  [ sec : deviations ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : branchcutdiff ] ) exhibits a situation where quantum numbers become equal , invalidating the naively - expected exclusion principle on the quantum numbers for the logarithmic bethe equations .",
    "usually the approximation of non - deviated strings for the bethe equations is considered , where the bethe equations are cast into a more convenient form in terms of the real string centers instead of complex rapidities .",
    "the resulting string quantum numbers  @xmath37 turn out to be strictly non - repeating , which will allow for a legitimate construction of all the possible combinations of string solutions .",
    "however , this approach fails to deal with the effect of string deviations . in order to treat deviations",
    "correctly it will be neccessary to reconstruct part of the bethe quantum numbers  @xmath38 from the string quantum numbers  @xmath39 at a future stage .",
    "the bethe - takahashi equations are an adaptation of the bethe equations for non - deviated string solutions .",
    "the basic strategy for their derivation is to take the product over the corresponding bethe equations for each rapidity inside a string , where the string rapidities in the approximation of non - deviated strings are parametrised as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the real part of the string and @xmath42 specifies the rapidity inside a string of length @xmath43 labeled by @xmath44 .",
    "the product over the free part of the spin-@xmath2 bethe equations  ( [ eq : bespins ] ) for rapidities within one @xmath43-string gives @xmath45 & = \\begin{cases } & \\cfrac{\\alpha_{j}^{1}-i}{\\alpha_{j}^{1}+i}\\quad \\text { for } n=1,\\\\[1.2em ] & \\cfrac{1+i\\alpha_{j}^{n}\\frac{2}{n+1}}{1-i\\alpha_{j}^{n}\\frac{2}{n+1}}\\ ; \\cfrac{1+i\\alpha_{j}^{n}\\frac{2}{n-1}}{1-i\\alpha_{j}^{n}\\frac{2}{n-1}}\\quad \\text { for } n\\ge2 .",

    "this implies that there is no @xmath12 dependence in the parity of the quantum numbers in the end . for one - strings",
    ", the minus sign can not be canceled and is being absorbed into the quantum numbers .",
    "this yields a different behaviour of quantum numbers for one - strings compared to other strings of higher length .",
    "a difference with respect to the spin-@xmath1 case emerges , where the parity of all string quantum numbers are dependent on both @xmath12 and @xmath51 , irrespective of the string length .",
    "the scattering part of the bethe equations is not dependent on spin , so this part of the derivation will have the same result as the original spin-@xmath1 bethe - takahashi equations  @xcite .",
    "the final result for the spin-@xmath2 bethe - takahashi equations is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the quantum numbers for one strings @xmath54 are integers for @xmath55 odd and half - odd integers for @xmath55 even . for higher strings @xmath56",

    "the highest possible quantum number for which the corresponding string consists of finite rapidities follows from @xmath59 . for the quantum numbers of larger strings ,",
    "it is necessary to subtract @xmath59 by the length of the string , as each rapidity at infinity that has to be placed back into a string with finite rapidities lowers the maximum allowed quantum number by one .",

    "for a state containing @xmath57 @xmath43-strings , the number of possible distributions of bethe - takahashi quantum numbers over @xmath57 available @xmath43-strings is @xmath64    for the ground state in zero field ( @xmath65 ) consisting of two - strings only , it is straightforward to show that the total number of allowable quantum numbers is @xmath66 . distributing @xmath66 two - strings over this available set of quantum numbers yields only one possible configuration . for the remaining excited states , we must seek a different configuration of string solutions .",
    "two possible excitations for the spin-@xmath2 chain were already discussed in  @xcite , where the ground state sea of two - strings is perturbed with strings of length respectively one and three .",
    "we will extend this reasoning towards higher excitations which yield significant contributions to the dynamical structure factor .    in zero field",
    ", we can distinguish between two types of important low lying excitations with different total spin .",
    "in the first case , we consider excitations with the same number of rapidities as compared to the ground state , these being in the subsector where @xmath67 .",
    "secondly , excitations with important contribution to the dynamical structure factor will have one rapidity removed , thus being the highest weight states in the @xmath68 subsector .",
