    "in this paper , we study groups of generalised braids on a surface @xmath0 .",
    "we shall assume that this surface is connected , oriented and closed , and we assign colours to all the strands of our braids .",
    "the main novelty is that we want to extend the set of homotopies so as to allow strands to intersect ( i.e. pass through each other ) according to certain rules , unlike ordinary braids .",
    "these rules will depend on the colours of the strands , which we take from a finite set . to implement the obvious composition law",
    ", we must require that all our braids are _ colour - pure _ in the sense that the point on @xmath0 where a given strand starts will be the endpoint for a strand of the same colour ( but this could possibly be a different strand ) ; such coloured braids , pictured as usual in @xmath5 \\times \\sigma$ ] , also determine closed braids inside @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of colours used . the rules of intersection of strands will be determined by a graph @xmath1 ( without orientation ) whose set of vertices @xmath7 is in bijection with the set of colours . as additional data",
    ", we will need a function @xmath8 on the set of vertices .",
    "the value @xmath9 will be thought of as a decoration or label at each vertex @xmath10 of @xmath1 ; alternatively , we can introduce an order on the set of vertices and record the labels @xmath11 as a vector in @xmath12 .",
    "the pair @xmath13 will be referred to as a _ negative colour scheme_. together with the genus of the surface @xmath0 , it will completely specify a particular group of braids with @xmath14 .",
    "the intersection of strands is determined by the following rule : strands of two different colours are forbidden to intersect whenever the corresponding vertices are connected by an edge in @xmath1 . in particular , we may discard graphs with multiple edges without loss of generality . if @xmath1 consisted of a single vertex @xmath10 and a single edge starting and ending at this vertex ( which we will call a _ self - loop _ ) , then @xmath15 would simply be the braid group @xmath16 on @xmath17 strands on the surface @xmath0 , which is a familiar object  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we want to restrict our attention to negative colour schemes whose graphs do not contain self - loops",
    ". as we shall see , the corresponding generalised braid groups will still be interesting objects , arising quite naturally in mathematics . as a simple example ,",
    "if @xmath1 is a complete graph ( i.e. all pairs of vertices are connected by an edge ) with @xmath3 vertices , all labelled by the integer @xmath18 , we obtain the pure braid group  @xcite on @xmath3 strands @xmath19 on the surface ; a particular case is of course the fundamental group @xmath20 .    given an element @xmath21 of @xmath22 where @xmath1 has no self - loops , one can interpret the sub - braid @xmath23 consisting of all strands of a fixed colour @xmath24 as describing a homotopy class of loops on the space of effective divisors of degree @xmath11 on @xmath0 based at a reduced divisor . in this spirit",
    ", we shall from now on refer to the elements of our braid groups @xmath22 as _ divisor braids_.",
    "our study of divisor braid groups is directly motivated by a problem in gauge theory .",
    "it is well known that when @xmath0 is a riemann surface the symmetric products @xmath25 are smooth manifolds with an induced complex structure , and they are of interest in algebraic geometry as spaces of effective divisors of degree @xmath26 on @xmath0 . if in addition we endow @xmath0 with a symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure ( a khler area form ) , there is a way of inducing khler structures ( and in particular riemannian metrics ) on @xmath27 as well  in fact , a real one - dimensional family of them .",
    "this comes about because these manifolds are moduli spaces of solutions ( modulo gauge equivalence ) of the _ vortex equations _ in line bundles of degree @xmath26 over @xmath0 .",
    "the fundamental groups of these spaces @xmath28 are either @xmath29 for @xmath30 or its abelianisation @xmath31 for @xmath32 , and both of these groups are particular cases of our divisor braid groups ( for the latter , we take a graph consisting of a single vertex with label @xmath26 ) .",
    "there are many ways to generalise the vortex equations beyond line bundles .",
    "one possibility is to consider vortices with more general khler toric target manifolds @xmath33 , using the real torus @xmath34 of @xmath33 as the structure group of the gauge theory , and specify a moment map @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath33 is compact , one is dealing with a class of abelian nonlinear vortices whose moduli spaces @xmath36 ( under suitable stability asumptions ) have been identified  @xcite with certain open submanifolds of a cartesian product of symmetric products @xmath37 in this product , the indices @xmath10 are taken from the set of rays @xmath38 in the normal fan determining the toric manifold @xmath33 ; see e.g.  @xcite for background on toric geometry .",
    "the label @xmath39 can be interpreted as an element of the @xmath34-equivariant homology group @xmath40 , and it corresponds to the image of the generator @xmath41\\in h_2(\\sigma;{{\\mathbb z } } ) \\cong { { \\mathbb z}}$ ] under the _ bps charge _ that is relevant to this setup  see  @xcite for the general definition in the framework of vortices in toric fibre bundles over closed khler manifolds of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the integers @xmath11 are obtained from the formula @xmath42 using the pairing of @xmath34-equivariant cohomology and homology of @xmath33 in degree 2 ; in this formula , @xmath43 are the @xmath34-equivariant first chern classes of irreducible @xmath34-equivariant divisors in @xmath33 corresponding to the rays in the normal fan  @xcite .",
    "the spaces @xmath44 also carry a natural khler structure ( see section  [ sec : vortices ] below ) which plays an important role in the description of gauged nonlinear sigma - models associated to the vortex equations , both at classical and quantum level  see  @xcite for a study of this so - called @xmath45-metric in simple examples where @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out that the moduli spaces @xmath36 in this situation have fundamental groups that provide examples of the divisor braid groups described in this paper .",
    "this fact is established in proposition  [ onlysk1 ] , which also clarifies how to construct the relevant graph @xmath1 in the negative colour scheme from the combinatorial data of the toric target @xmath33 ; see also equation ( [ fundgroups ] ) .",
    "the set of vertices or colours @xmath47 corresponds to the set of rays in the normal fan of @xmath33 , whereas the labels @xmath11 are determined as in ( [ charges ] ) .",
    "we shall provide the reader with more background about the whole setup in section  [ sec : vortices ] , and also indicate why understanding the structure of this particular class of divisor braid groups and their representation varieties , as well as certain hilbert modules over the associated von neumann algebras , is significant in the context of supersymmetric quantum field theory in two dimensions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : fundamental ] , we make our definition of divisor braids precise , and identify the groups @xmath48 introduced more informally above as fundamental groups of a canonical type of @xmath49-dimensional configuration spaces @xmath50 ; these spaces are hybrids between symmetric products and ordinary configuration spaces modelled on the surface @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : pictures ] , we show that each such @xmath48 is a central extension of the group @xmath2 by a certain abelian group @xmath51 .",
    "we give generators for @xmath51 and some relations ; this provides a surjective map @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an abelian group presented in terms of generators and relations . in section  [ sec :",
    "linking ] we prove that , for the case of two colours @xmath54 , the map @xmath52 is an isomorphism . the proof we shall give relies on the construction of a link invariant on @xmath51 . in section  [ sec : colors ] , we extend this link invariant to the case of an arbitrary number of colours . again",
    ", this can be used to show that the map @xmath52 is an isomorphism . in section  [ sec : center ]",
    "we explain how the group @xmath53 depends on the decorated graph @xmath55 .",
    "as might be expected , the most intricate dependence occurs at the level of the finite abelian group @xmath56 ; an approach to the study this phenomenon for negative colour schemes @xmath55 based on a fixed graph @xmath1 is presented in  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec.examples ] collects a handful of examples chosen to illustrate some features of the general theory .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : ncg ] , we describe the von neumann algebras associated to very composite divisor braid groups in terms of noncommutative tori ; this exercise is motivated by the applications to mathematical physics that we describe in section  2 . +",

    "so there is a projection @xmath82 specified by @xmath74 , and this in turn determines a covariant derivative @xmath83 on sections of @xmath84 by @xmath85 .",

    "the pairs @xmath110 playing the role of variables in the system of equations ( [ vortex ] ) form the infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath111 where the first factor ( the space of @xmath62-connections in @xmath75 ) is an affine space over the vector space @xmath112 , and the second factor denotes smooth sections of @xmath84 .",

    "the most convenient way of realising our toric manifold @xmath33 ( see  @xcite ) is perhaps by starting from a fixed free abelian group @xmath144 , which determines @xmath145 , and specify a convex polytope @xmath146 with the following properties :    1 .   at each vertex of @xmath147 ,",

    "the same argument can be followed through in the case @xmath1407 , but now all the generators @xmath1408 commute ; thus they can be modelled on multiplication by the coordinate functions of a @xmath665-dimensional torus , acting on the space of all bounded functions on that torus ( identified whenever they agree almost everywhere ) .",
    "the torus itself can be naturally interpreted as a product of two copies of the complex torus @xmath1409 of topologically trivial holomorphic line bundles ( or flat @xmath213-connections ) on the riemann surface @xmath0 .",
    "the isomorphisms in ( [ n0 ] ) are standard from fourier analysis .",
    "it is clear that the statement in this proposition generalises in an almost obvious fashion to any very composite divisor braid group @xmath1110 as in theorem  [ present ] , if we assume that this group has finite centre .",
    "if @xmath1410 is the number of colours as before , then the associated von neumann algebra @xmath1339 is a finite product of @xmath1103-dimensional noncommutative tori @xmath1411 over the group of characters @xmath1412 of the centre , but with a commutative factor @xmath1413 over the trivial character @xmath1414 ; all these tori @xmath1411 ( as many as the order of the centre ) have rational noncommutative parameters .",
    "these can be described in relation to any basis of @xmath31 by quantities @xmath1415 once again , the square matrices @xmath1416_{\\lambda,\\ell ; \\lambda',\\ell ' = 1}^{r,2g}$ ] are skew - symmetric under swapping @xmath1417 , symmetric under swapping @xmath1418 , and have zero entries for @xmath608 .",
    "understanding their dependence on @xmath1419 is equivalent to the calculation of the torsion group @xmath780 , as discussed in section  [ sec : diophantine ] .",
    "a computation of @xmath780 in the sense of primary decomposition ( see e.g.  @xcite , theorem  8.14 ) leads to a description of the pontryagin dual @xmath1412 ( see  @xcite , chapter  4 ) as a sum of finite cyclic groups . then one may choose a symplectic basis for @xmath31 , factorise the von neumann algebra over the set of primary cyclic summands , and refer to proposition  [ vncyclic ] for a concrete description of the corresponding splitting as finite product of noncommutative tori .",
    "let @xmath575 be a very composite negative colour scheme in @xmath3 colours .",
    "then there is a product decomposition @xmath1420 over the pontryagin dual of the centre @xmath780 , where @xmath1421 is the enveloping von neumann algebra of a @xmath1103-dimensional noncommutative torus generated by unitaries @xmath1422 ( @xmath1423 and @xmath1424 ) for @xmath1425 , and @xmath1426 . in ( [ generalnctori ] ) ,",
    "a presentation of the noncommutative torus associated to @xmath1421 with rational noncommutative parameters @xmath1427 in all the relations @xmath1428 can be given if and only if @xmath1429 is a torsion element of the @xmath1430-torus .",
    "the first product in ( [ generalnctori ] ) corresponds to the factorisation sketched after proposition  [ vncyclic ] ; it can be obtained by considering the elements of @xmath1431 $ ] @xmath1432 in analogy to ( [ projector ] ) .",
    "the properties @xmath1433 can be checked exactly as in lemma  [ projectors ] .",
    "the idempotents ( [ projbetai ] ) provide projection operators in the reduced group @xmath1348-algebra acting on the hilbert space @xmath1434 and taking the bicommutant of their ranges we obtain von neumann subalgebras @xmath1435 , as well as a finite product decomposition @xmath1436 , which parallels our discussion in the two - colour case .    to factorise @xmath1411 ( or the corresponding factors of the group @xmath1348-algebra ) further ,",
    "we need to employ the characters of the free part of the centre ; however , they do not supply a family of mutually orthogonal projectors as in the discussion of the torsion part ( see @xcite , section 2 of chapter i in part i ) .",
    "instead , one needs to recast each @xmath1437 as a ( measurable ) field of von neumann algebras ( see also @xcite , chapter  3 in part  ii ) over the torus @xmath1438 equipped with its haar measure .",
    "the decomposition of each @xmath1437 as a field of von neumann algebras can be achieved via the spectral decomposition of the cartan subalgebra @xmath1439 this construction can be understood via the technique of virtual eigenvectors introduced originally by von neumann , and which is presented in some detail in part ( i ) of section  24 ( in  6 ) of chapter  xi in reference  @xcite . applying this machinery",
    ", one decomposes the subspace @xmath1440 , where the operators representing @xmath1441 act via the character @xmath1419 , as a direct integral of hilbert spaces ( see part ( ii ) of the same section in  @xcite ) over the spectrum ( i.e.  space of maximal ideals ) of @xmath1442 .",
    "because @xmath1443 , this spectrum can be identified with the torus @xmath1438 ( see e.g.  19 and chapter iv in reference  @xcite ) , so one obtains a direct integral splitting @xmath1444 strictly speaking , in the general theory the factors @xmath1445 depend on a choice of measure , but one can make this choice natural by taking @xmath1446 in ( [ hilbsplit ] ) to be the normalised ( probability ) haar measure on @xmath1438 ( see  24 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the orthogonal decomposition @xmath1447 obtained from the projectors @xmath1448 , together with ( [ hilbsplit ] ) , combine into a splitting of the whole of @xmath1388 for which all the operators @xmath1449 for @xmath1450 are diagonal , and thereby the @xmath1348-algebra of the centre identifies with the algebra of continuous functions on its pontryagin dual @xmath1451 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1452 the torsion component of an element @xmath1450 . then by construction @xmath1453 is an invariant subspace for @xmath1454 and @xmath1455 as anticipated in the statement of our theorem , in ( [ diagpichi ] ) we are using multiplicative notation for characters @xmath1429 of the free part of the centre @xmath780 for convenience ( see  21 in  @xcite ) , but still using additive notation for the torsion part .",
    "more generally , any operator @xmath1456 for @xmath1457 decomposes with respect to the splitting obtained for @xmath1458 ; i.e. each @xmath1453 is invariant for @xmath1459 and @xmath1460 where @xmath1461 is a unitary operator on @xmath1462 for each @xmath1463 .",
    "this follows directly from theorem  1 in  2.5 of part ii of reference  @xcite , as these operators generate the commutant of @xmath1464 .",
    "by von neumann s bicommutant theorem ( see e.g.  theorem 1.2.1 in @xcite ) , these operators generate the group von neumann algebra of @xmath1465 , hence the decomposition ( [ generalnctori ] ) follows .    to obtain a more precise description of each integrand @xmath1421",
    ", we proceed in analogy with our argument in proposition  [ vncyclic ] .",
    "recall from theorem  [ present ] that a set of generators of the divisor braid group can be written as @xmath1466 , for @xmath1150 and @xmath271 an index for a @xmath167-basis of @xmath31 ( which we assume symplectic ) .",
    "for a fixed character @xmath1419 of @xmath1467 , consider the measurable field @xmath1468 of @xmath1348-algebras over @xmath1438 generated by unitaries @xmath1469 with labels as above , and whose commutators are assumed diagonalisable : @xmath1470= \\int^\\oplus_{{\\rm u}(1)^{{\\rm rk } e_{{\\mathbf{k}}}(\\gamma ) } }   \\exp\\left ( 2 \\pi { \\rm i } \\",
