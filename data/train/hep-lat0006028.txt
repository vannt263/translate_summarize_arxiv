    "recently there has been renewed interest in understanding the role of vortices in the mechanism of colour confinement  @xcite .",

    "in @xmath0 such a vortex contributes a factor @xmath8 to each wilson loop with an odd linking number with the vortex line . on a lattice",
    ", the world - sheet @xmath9 of the vortex can be associated to a surface on the dual lattice .",
    "a vortex creation operator is defined by twisting the plaquettes in the action , whose duals belong to that surface .",
    "while creating a vortex is a well defined procedure , detecting vortices in lattice gauge configurations is more difficult .",
    "attempts in this direction stemmed from  @xcite , and results were obtained by several groups  @xcite , indicating that vortices can play a role in confinement . however , it is not clear that this procedure detects the vortices as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : comm ] ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the current picture of the role of vortices in colour confinement is based on eq .",
    "[ eq : comm ] : at low temperature , vortices disorder the wilson loop to produce the well - known area law ; at high temperature , vortices are suppressed and the wilson loop obeys a perimeter law .    in three dimensions",
    ", a conserved topological quantum number can be associated to a vortex , and a vortex creation operator is defined as a local complex scalar field .",
    "the dynamics of this scalar field is described by an effective lagrangian with a global _ dual _  @xmath10 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the breaking of this symmetry is responsible for the different phases of the theory .",
    "the scalar field @xmath11 in three dimensions has a non - trivial commutation relations , analogous to those of eq .",
    "[ eq : comm ] , with any wilson loop encircling the point @xmath12 .",
    "operators that create such topological excitation are known in statistical mechanics as `` disorder operators ''  @xcite and the expectation value of a disorder operator is a disorder parameter and is related to the free energy of the associated topological excitation .    in four dimensions the situation is less clear .",
    "the vortex corresponds to a string - like topological defect and the dual symmetry does not emerge naturally . in this respect , there is a fundamental difference between the vortex and the monopole picture of colour confinement in terms of symmetry : for the monopoles , a topologically conserved current exists , whose zero component is the generator of the dual symmetry , and a picture based on a mechanism , namely the dual meissner effect @xcite , emerges as a consequence of the breaking of the dual symmetry  @xcite . for the vortices the symmetry pattern is not understood . in close analogy with previous work on abelian - projected monopoles ,",
    "it is nonetheless possible to define a vortex creation operator obeying the above commutation relation , which can be associated to the free energy of the vortex . starting from this point of view ,",
    "in this paper we study the role of vortices across the deconfinement phase transition , using the techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for investigating the condensation of monopoles defined via the abelian projection .    a vortex creation operator @xmath13 is introduced as a disorder operator for the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "when applied to a gauge configuration , @xmath13 creates a vortex associated to a string closing in the @xmath14 direction via periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . as well as for other systems , both in statistical mechanics  @xcite and in quantum field theory  @xcite",
    ", such an operator can be constructed without any reference to the dual theory . in sect .",
    "[ sect : vco ] we give the explicit construction of this operator . while our study was in progress , other papers appeared which addressed similar problems by using quantities related to the vortex creation operator examined in this work .",
    "the explicit relationship between the operator studied here and other quantities in the literature is reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sect : comp ] .",
    "correlation functions of the vortex creation operator at zero and finite temperature yield useful informations on the behaviour of these topological defects in the @xmath2 yang - mills vacuum . as in previous studies on monopoles , it is convenient to compute @xmath15 and analogous quantities for @xmath7-point correlators . unlike @xmath13",
    ", @xmath16 can be determined with good accuracy and provides all the needed information . the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of @xmath13 proves to be a disorder parameter for the finite temperature deconfining phase transition , as reported in sect .",

    "another interesting quantity to be investigated is the correlator @xmath17 at zero temperature .",
    "this approach can be generalised to @xmath2 gauge group and to vortex loops of generic geometry , also not wrapping through pbc .",
    "work is in progress on these aspects .",
    "the vortex creation operator @xmath13 is constructed by the same technique used for the monopole creation operator in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of @xmath13 is defined as the ratio of two partition functions : @xmath18 e^{-\\beta \\,\\tilde s[u]}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the usual partition function with the wilson action , @xmath20 = \\sum_{x,\\mu\\nu } { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\left[1 - p_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath22 by twisting a line of plaquettes in the @xmath23 plane : @xmath24 the net effect of this transformation is best understood by performing a series of changes of variables in the functional integral as follows . the first change : @xmath25 yields @xmath26 e^{-\\beta \\,\\tilde s^{(1)}[u]}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is defined by the following transformation of the wilson action : @xmath28    the change of sign in the @xmath29 plaquettes introduced at @xmath30 in eq .",

    "we remark here that these prescriptions create vortex lines that are closed in space , due to pbc in the @xmath14-direction , and propagate in time .    at large values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 decreases exponentially to an asymptotic value , which , by cluster property , is @xmath48 , the square of the disorder parameter : @xmath49 at @xmath50 , @xmath51 can be extracted from the large-@xmath46 value of the correlator , according to eq .",

    "closed vortex lines propagating in time can be created in a field configuration with the same prescription , but with a different modification of the action .",
    "for instance , using for the modified action : @xmath53 gives a vortex line encircling the rectangle in the @xmath54 plane : @xmath55 the same definition is used in a recent publication  @xcite .",
    "our disorder parameter is strictly related to observables introduced by other authors  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath13 has large fluctuations , which make a direct measurement a challenging task . instead , as in previous studies  @xcite , we define @xmath81 being the difference of the expectation values of two actions",
    ", @xmath16 can be easily computed , and proves to yield all the relevant information . at finite temperature",
    ", @xmath16 is expected to have a sharp negative peak in the critical region  @xcite , if @xmath82 is related to the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "our results for @xmath16 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitet1 ] , for several lattice sizes . for comparison",
    ", we also report a plot of the corresponding quantity for the _ vev _ of a monopole creation operator on a @xmath83 lattice @xcite . already at a qualitative level",
    ", it is clear that , at weak coupling , @xmath16 is negative , with its absolute value increasing with the volume .",
    "this behaviour implies that @xmath84 vanishes for large @xmath85 in the thermodynamical limit . at low @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath16 is compatible with 0 for all the volumes considered in this study , which means that @xmath84 has a non - zero value in the infinite volume limit in the confined phase .",
    "the presence of the negative peak connecting the confined and deconfined phases suggests that vortices play a role at the deconfinement transition .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the results in  @xcite . as in the case of monopoles  @xcite",
    ", we can perform a finite size scaling analysis of the data presented above . in neighborhood of the critical coupling @xmath86 , if @xmath84 is a disorder parameter for the deconfining phase transition , in the infinite volume limit we have @xmath87 being @xmath88 the corresponding critical index . in a finite volume ,",
    "the previous equation is replaced by @xmath89 where @xmath70 is the correlation length and @xmath90 is a function of the ratio @xmath91 . since @xmath92 eq .",
    "( [ musca1 ] ) can be written as @xmath93 being @xmath94 the critical index of the correlation length .",
    "( [ musca2 ] ) implies @xmath95 i.e. the ratio @xmath96 is an universal function of the scaling variable @xmath97    by guessing that @xcite @xmath98 it is possible to extract from our data the critical exponents @xmath88 and @xmath94 and the critical coupling @xmath86 .",
    "we perform three different fits : a fit with three parameters , a fit to @xmath88 and @xmath94 at fixed @xmath86 , using the value in  @xcite , and again a two parameter fit to @xmath88 and @xmath94 at fixed @xmath86 , using the value obtained in the three parameter fit .",
    "the error is estimated from the variation in the fitted values when using the different methods described above and when the points corresponding to smaller correlation lengths are excluded .",
    "our results are : @xmath99 the values of @xmath86 and @xmath94 are in good agreement with the values obtained in @xcite , while the value of @xmath88 varies by two standard deviations , when compared to previous results .    fig .  [ figscaling ] shows how well the scaling relation is obeyed with the values of @xmath86 and @xmath94 from the above fit .    assuming that in the weak coupling limit all link variables are close to unity , and remembering that the twisted action is obtained by flipping the sign of @xmath100 plaquettes , a naive prediction would yield : @xmath101 this is a justification for the linear dependence used in the ansatz above .",
    "however , the actual value of the coefficient @xmath102 does not need to be the one in eq .",
    "[ eq : naivept ] , since the configuration with all links set to the identity is not the true minimum of the modified action which enters the definition of @xmath16 .    to check this behaviour ,",
    "we have measured @xmath16 for different volumes and very large values of the coupling . in this region , we expect the data to be independent of @xmath85 . within the errors",
    "the data do lie on a straight line as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : naivept ] .",
    "the fact that the slope is negative ensures that the disorder operator vanishes in the weak coupling phase in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath16 at low @xmath85 s is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] : the value at low @xmath85 remains bounded from below and consistent with zero for increasing volumes , which guarantees that @xmath16 does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit above the phase transition .",
    "another quantity that can give information on the behaviour of center vortices in the vacuum of su(2 ) is the correlation function of two @xmath13 operators as a function of distance at zero temperature . when relabelling the axes , as discussed in the previous section , this quantity is identical to the free energy recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "again , our numerical computation is performed in terms of @xmath103 , now defined as @xmath104 which is the difference between two actions . since the usual wilson contribution is @xmath46-independent , the whole dependence on @xmath46 is brought by @xmath105 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] we display the behaviour of @xmath105 on a @xmath106 lattice at @xmath107 , where the system is confined and scaling is supposed to work .",
    "the @xmath46 dependence of the correlation is fitted using two different fitting functions , both depending on three parameters @xmath108 : @xmath109 these two fits will be named respectively fit i and fit ii in what follows . the functional dependence in fit",
    "i describes a yukawa potential between vortices , as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases",
    ", @xmath110 is the asymptotic value of @xmath103 and is expected to be different from zero if vortices are condensed .",
    "both ansatz fit the data relatively well , despite the fact that the masses obtained are quite different .",
    "the values of @xmath111 give an indication that fit ii could be a better description of the data , although it is impossible to draw any robust conclusion given that it is very difficult to disentangle the logarithmic correction in @xmath46 which differentiate fit i from fit ii .",
    "the outcome of the fits is summarised in table  [ tab : fit_res ] and the two fitting curves are superimposed on the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath110 is determined quite accurately due to the plateau in the data points at large @xmath46 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that @xmath102 turns out to be negative in both cases up to 90% cl , while the error on the fitted mass is very large .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that large variations in @xmath112 can be reabsorbed by variations in @xmath102 in the range where data points are available .",
    ".fit results for the correlation of vortex operators [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we notice from fit ii that the correlation length is around 1.3 lattice spacings .",
    "this justifies the view of the pair of vortices ( the one at the center of the lattice and the one at the border produced by pbc ) as independent .",
    "in previous works  @xcite , we produced evidence of dual superconductivity of the qcd vacuum , supporting the mechanism of refs .",
    "a peculiar feature of this phenomenon is that monopoles defined by different abelian projections all condense  @xcite .",
    "this possibility was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and lattice data support it , showing that confinement is related to condensation of magnetic charges defined by a few abelian projections .",
    "if all or a large class of abelian projections are equivalent , there are infinitely many physically equivalent disorder symmetries .",
    "we already observed that this fact is not inconsistent , but suggests that maybe a more fundamental dual symmetry pattern exists , which can manifest itself as condensation of all these magnetic charges  @xcite .",
    "now it is found that also vortices show condensation .",
    "we were not able to associate a dual conserved topological quantity to vortices in 3 + 1 dimensions , contrary to what happens in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "however we consider what is observed here an important information on the way to understand the features of the dual description .",
    "we are extending the analysis to the vortices of the @xmath113 gauge theory and to some aspects of closed vortex lines .",
    "we are also trying to understand what happens in the presence of quarks .",
    "preliminary data on condensation of monopoles , as defined by the abelian projections , show that the presence of quarks does not affect the dual superconductor picture .",
    "this is in agreement with the idea that the gross features of the qcd vacuum , including the mechanism of confinement , are determined already at @xmath114  @xcite .",
