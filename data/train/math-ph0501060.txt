    "finite dimensional integrable systems have been a rarity for a very long time ; up to few decades ago , they could be easily enumerated : harmonic oscillators , the kepler system , a few spinning tops .",
    "apart from harmonic oscillators  which give linear equations and are the prototype of integrability  these are integrated by exploiting their symmetries and the associated integrals of motion to reduce the problem to a lower dimensional one ; thus , we have _ symmetry reduction_.    the situation changed radically in the seventies , when entire classes of new integrable systems appeared , integrable by the lax pair construction @xcite . among these a prominent role  also due to priority  is taken by the calogero system @xcite . in this case",
    ", one has an arbitrary number @xmath2 of points on the line , interacting via a certain pair potential ; thus the system is described by a natural hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "calogero showed that there is an invertible map from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , mapping the vector @xmath6 to a matrix @xmath7 , such that the evolution of @xmath8 results in an evolution of @xmath9 $ ] governed by lax equations ; thus one integrates @xmath10 and obtains @xmath11 .",
    "as pointed out by kazhdan , kostant and sternberg @xcite , this also initiated a new way of integrating systems ( which they studied geometrically ) : indeed , rather than trying to reduce the dimension of the system , calogero passed to consider a system of _ higher dimension_. in this note we want to show that this approach is fruitful also beyond the realm of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the key observation made by kazhdan , kostant and sternberg @xcite , see also @xcite , in the context of hamiltonian systems is that given a differential equation @xmath12 in dimension @xmath13 , in some cases it may be helpful to increase its dimension : this is in particular the case when it is possible to describe @xmath12 as originating from either the symmetry reduction or the projection to an @xmath13-dimensional manifold of a simpler ( e.g. linear ) equations @xmath14 in dimension @xmath15 .",
    "it was remarked in @xcite that this approach does apply also to non - hamiltonian systems , and in particular to systems in poincar - dulac normal form @xcite ( a remark to this effect was already contained in @xcite ) .",
    "essentially , a system in normal form with only a finite number of resonances can always be mapped to a linear system , and is equivalent to the latter on a certain invariant manifold . as observed there ,",
    "such a procedure is geometrically interesting , but equivalent to a classical technique already known to dulac @xcite , and abscribed by him to horn and lyapounov . in more general terms",
    ", i.e. outside the scope of normal forms theory , this corresponds to the situation of a finite dimensional centralizer for a certain algebra associated to the vector field @xcite .    in the present note ,",
    "we show how `` dimension increasing '' nicely combines with a `` splitting '' ( in a sense to be described below ) approach @xcite in the case of an infinite number of resonances ; this case can not be tackled by the horn  lyapounov ",
    "dulac approach .",
    "roughly speaking , the procedure presented in this note combines the two approaches mentioned above , i.e. describing a nonlinear system as projection of a linear one and symmetry reduction in the sense described in @xcite .",
    "a more abstract ( and general ) treatment is given elsewhere @xcite ; in the present note we adopt an approach and notation aimed at applications , and discuss a number of concrete applications .",
    "we focus on systems in normal form ( sect.2 ) and in particular on the embedding and splitting of systems with infinitely many resonances ( sect.3 ) .",
    "some simple examples are discussed in sect.4 , while sect.5 is devoted to ( in general non - hamiltonian ) nonlinearly perturbed oscillators , and sect.6 to bifurcation problems .",
    "we consider an ode in @xmath16 with a fixed point in the origin and expanded around this in a power series ; we write this in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is polynomial with @xmath19 , and we have singled out the linear part @xmath20 . we also write @xmath21 for the nonlinear part of @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .    as well known , the matrix @xmath24 can be uniquely decomposed into its semisimple and nilpotent parts , which commute with each other and hence with @xmath24 : @xmath25 = 0 .\\ ] ] in the following , we will use the following vector fields ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27      let us denote by @xmath28 the eigenvalues of @xmath24 ; take a basis @xmath29 in @xmath16 consisting of generalized eigenvectors of @xmath24 , i.e. eigenvectors of @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "we will use @xmath6 coordinates in this basis , and the multiindex notation @xmath32    we say that the vector monomial @xmath33 is _ resonant _ with @xmath24 if @xmath34    the relation @xmath35 is said to be a _ resonance relation _ related to the eigenvalue @xmath36 , and the integer @xmath37 is said to be the _ order _ of the resonance . in our context it is useful to include order one resonances in the definition ( albeit the _ trivial _ order one resonances given by @xmath38 are of little interest ) . note that here one could as well consider @xmath30 rather than @xmath24 .",
    "the space of vectors resonant with ( the semisimple part of ) @xmath24 is defined as the linear span of the vectors @xmath39 defined above .",
    "we say ( see e.g. @xcite ) that ( 1 ) is in poincar - dulac normal form if its nonlinear part @xmath40 is resonant with @xmath24 .",

    "as well known , starting from any dynamical system ( or vector field ) of the form ( 1 ) , we can arrive at a dynamical system ( or vector field ) in poincar - dulac normal form by means of a sequence ( in general , infinite ) of near - identity transformations obtained by means of the poincar algorithm ; these combine into a near - identity transformation @xmath47 defined by a series which is in general only formal .",

    "in this section we will discuss how the procedure described in @xcite generalizes , in connection with a `` splitting '' of the system described by @xmath70 @xcite , in the presence of invariance relations .",
