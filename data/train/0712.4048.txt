    "the results , obtained with our specific model of a meandering jet , can be resumed as follows .",
    "we detected and located the upos of periods 1 and 4 .",

    "we would like to stress the following .",
    "rotational and ballistic resonant islands are well known objects in the phase space of hamiltonian systems @xcite . as far as we know , rotation - ballistic resonant islands of stability have not been found before .",
    "they are expected to appear as well in other jet - flow models ( kinematic and dynamic ones ) under specific values of control parameters , and it would be interesting to search for them in the models introduced in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that boundaries of the rotational - ballistic islands are specific dynamical traps that should affect transport and statistical properties of passive particles and may be treated by the methods developed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , by linearizing the advection equations , we have studied the properties of the period-1 saddle orbits playing a crucial role in chaotic transport and mixing of passive particles .",
    "the upos with larger values of the period can be classified into three big groups : ballistic , rotational and rotation - ballistic ones .",
    "the origin and bifurcations of the orbits in each class can be studied in a similar way , but it may require larger computational efforts .    the results obtained do not depend critically on the exact form of the streamfunction and chosen values of the control parameters .",
    "the upos in other kinematic and dynamical models of geophysical jets , known in the literature @xcite , can be detected , located and classified in a similar way .",
    "the upos form the skeleton for chaotic advective mixing and transport in fluid flows , and the knowledge of them ( at least , lower - period ones ) allows us to analyze complex , albeit rather regular , stretching and folding structures in the flows .",
    "the work was supported by the russian foundation for basic research ( grant no .",
