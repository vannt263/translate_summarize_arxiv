    "recent advances in the understanding of strong dynamics and symmetry breaking in supersymmetric theories , as reported at this conference , have made clear an impressive diversity of phenomena which can arise in strongly interacting theories .",
    "this has led to renewed efforts in the search for a plausible dynamical theory of quark and lepton masses , especially in theories incorporating supersymmetry .",
    "but the wide range of phenomena uncovered in strongly interacting supersymmetric theories might be considered to suggest a corresponding range of phenomena in strong gauge dynamics in general . in particular",
    "one might expect that the diversity of the phenomena would be at least as great when the constraints of supersymmetry are removed .",
    "this possibility is somewhat at odds with the typical viewpoint taken in attempts to incorporate dynamical symmetry breaking , without supersymmetry , into realistic models .",
    "much of the previous work over the years have focused on the construction of models with dynamics resembling that of qcd as closely as possible .    in this",
    "talk we will illustrate the role that non - qcd - like dynamics , in particular dynamics which gives rise anomalous power - law scaling , could play in realistic models of fermion mass .",
    "we describe how a model with a simple symmetry structure can give rise to a wide variety of 4-fermion operators , which in the presence of anomalous scaling , can give rise to a mass spectrum with nontrivial , and potentially realistic , mixings and hierarchies .",
    "there are other reasons why a fresh perspective on dynamical symmetry breaking may be useful .",
    "we begin by listing some statements and implicit assumptions sometimes made in connection with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , and suggest why these statements may not be completely correct .    *",
    "`` the top mass is so large that it must be involved with the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics '' .",
    "+  not necessarily , since 175 is small compared to 1000 .",
    "if a dynamical fermion mass is responsible for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses , then we expect that fermion mass to be closer to 1000 gev than to 175 gev .",
    "* `` if the @xmath2 mass has a dynamical origin then @xmath3 is too large . ''",
    "+  not necessarily , if contributions to @xmath4 are suppressed by powers of 175/1000 . * ``",
    "the dynamical origin of the @xmath2 mass is distinct from that of other quarks . '' for example in `` topcolor''@xcite models it is postulated that the top mass comes from @xmath5 operators rather than @xmath6 operators . here",
    "@xmath7 is the tev - mass fermion responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "+  not necessarily , since @xmath6 operators are by themselves still okay ; we will see that these operators make contributions to @xmath4 which are suppressed by powers of 175/1000 .",
    "the real problem is somewhat removed from @xmath2 mass generation and has to do with is explaining why isospin - violating operators of the form @xmath8 are not too large .",
    "we will argue that this problem may be resolved in a situation where some operators enjoy more anomalous scaling than other operators .",
    "* `` the scale of new flavor physics must be well above a tev . ''",
    "+  not necessarily , since a tev scale for new flavor physics coupling mainly to third family fermions is not yet ruled out . * `` a guaranteed signature of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking is some kind of @xmath9-like resonance at a tev . '' +  not necessarily , if the new strong interaction at a tev is itself broken .",
    "the effects of strong dynamics in that case may not look much like qcd dynamics . *",
    "`` dynamical symmetry breaking destroys the concept of coupling constant unification . ''",
    "+  we will suggest below why the observed values of the couplings may not be completely accidental , even when new strong interactions are present .",
    "we will be illustrating all the above points in an explicit model . at the very least",
    ", the model will hopefully illustrate why the following two statements are false .",
    "* `` elementary scalar fields must be introduced to build realistic theories of flavor . '' * `` fined - tuned 4-fermion operators must be introduced to build realistic theories of flavor . ''    these two statements are given together because the fine - tuning sometimes invoked in connection with 4-fermion operators is closely related to the fine - tuning associated with light elementary scalar fields .",
    "it is well known that when fine - tuned 4-fermion operators are arranged to generate small dynamical fermion masses , they also generate light composite scalar particles .",
    "we clearly want to avoid such fine - tuning .",
    "the key point for the following discussion is the possibility that the anomalous scaling present in strongly interacting theories can turn 4-fermion operators into relevant , or nearly relevant , operators .",
    "that is , 4-fermion operators have an effective dimension close to four instead of six .",
    "such operators can play the role of yukawa couplings .",
    "they provide an alternative method for feeding down flavor physics at high scales into the quark and lepton mass spectrum , without the introduction of scalar fields .",
    "relevant 4-fermion operators were found to arise in quenched qed in ladder approximation.@xcite but the phenomenon appears more general , and it is closely related to the tendency for the scaling dimension of the mass operator @xmath10 to become two ( anomalous dimension @xmath11 ) when the gauge coupling is above some critical value , @xmath12 .",
    "arguments supporting this conclusion have been made using the operator product expansion,@xcite and using general properties of the schwinger - dyson equation.@xcite if this is accepted then a large anomalous dimension for @xmath13 , perhaps close to two , can also be expected .",
    "the essential requirement is a @xmath14-function which is small over some range of momentum scales .",
    "nontrivial infrared fixed - points are clearly of interest in this context .",
    "the important point is that fine - tuning is not required .",
    "this is quite different from the fine - tuning of 4-fermion operators in the nambu - jona - lasino model which produces an effective anomalous dimension twice as large : @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is related to the existence of light scalar @xmath10 bound states . in our case 4-fermion",
    "operators are relevant at low energies because the fermions feel a new strong interaction , and not because the coefficients of the 4-fermion interactions are finely tuned . instead of fine - tuning the physics at one scale to produce desired results at some much larger distance scale ,",
    "the anomalous scaling in our case is arising due to strong interactions acting over a range of scales .",
    "the operators of interest involve normal quarks and leptons , and thus the new gauge interactions acting on quarks and leptons at high energy scales must clearly be broken .",
    "these strong interactions must also be prevented from producing large masses for quarks and leptons .",
    "this is reasonable in a chiral gauge theory in which all masses break gauge symmetries .",
    "the 4-fermion operators which are being enhanced , on the other hand , need not break any gauge symmetries .",
    "the basic framework will share a few features with extended technicolor theories .    *",
    "a fermion condensate is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "* four - fermion operators , in the presence of this condensate , produce all other quark and lepton masses , including the top .    the minimal version we will describe differs from basic etc in the following ways .",
    "* there are new strong gauge interactions above a tev , but they do not survive below a tev . there is no unbroken technicolor .",
    "* we may call the new gauge interactions flavor interactions .",
    "they break down to a remnant flavor symmetry at some scale like 100 or 1000 tev , and the remnant survives down to a tev . * the third family , as well as a new fourth family , couple to the remnant flavor interactions , while the light two families couple only to the flavor interactions broken at the higher scale . *",
    "the dynamical fourth family quark masses are responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there are no technifermions . *",
    "the 4-fermion operators responsible for the quark masses are not of the form @xmath16 , but are rather of the form @xmath17 where @xmath7 denotes a fourth family quark .",
    "( these operators can not arise by explicit gauge boson exchange and must therefore originate dynamically . ) * the 4-fermion operator responsible for the @xmath2 mass is composed of third and fourth family quarks , and is strongly enhanced by the remnant flavor interactions .",
    "this particular operator may be close to being a relevant 4-fermion operator , as discussed above . *",
    "the dynamical fourth family quark masses are not in a singlet channel with respect to the remnant flavor interactions .",
    "we will illustrate these ideas by considering the most minimal flavor gauge symmetry we can imagine:@xcite @xmath18 such that the complete quark content of the theory is given by @xmath19 each @xmath20 field also transforms under the standard model gauge group as a normal quark , and thus there are enough fields here to describe the quarks of four families .",
    "interaction may be added , or alternatively some relevant 4-fermion operator may play an equivalent role in making the dynamics chiral.@xcite ] the flavor symmetry breaks at a scale @xmath21 100 to 1000 tev to @xmath22 , which is an unbroken combination of @xmath23 and the diagonal generator of @xmath24 .",
    "then the @xmath25 boson only couples to the third and fourth family quarks @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and not to the light quarks @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "flavor changing neutral currents involving the light two families are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath30 .",
    "we shall argue below that most of the mass mixing between families occurs in the up - sector .",
    "this combined with the fact that flavor interactions do not induce transitions between the @xmath28 and @xmath29 fields will suppress further the most problematical fcnc effect , @xmath31@xmath32 mixing .",
    "it is important to note that none of the fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are mass eigenstates .",
    "in fact the fourth family quark masses will correspond to @xmath33 as we have said , this is not a singlet under the remnant flavor symmetry @xmath22 , and it can only form once the @xmath22 breaks ( we discuss this breakdown below ) . although the @xmath34 is strong it is unclear whether it , along with possible 4-fermion interactions , is sufficient to produce the mass in ( [ bb ] ) .",
    "we will continue our discussion of the minimal flavor interactions and leave open for now the question of whether additional interactions are required . in the appendix",
    "we describe how an enlarged color interaction can help to produce these fourth family quark masses .",
    "we now consider a set of operators which will feed mass down from the fourth family quarks to the second and third family quarks . @xmath35 the @xmath36 contracts @xmath37 indices while the @xmath38 contracts @xmath39 indices .",
    "note that all these operators are @xmath39 singlets , i.e. in an attractive channel with respect to @xmath24 interactions .",
    "thus although these operators are not generated by an explicit @xmath24 gauge boson exchange , they could be expected to be produced dynamically by strong @xmath24 interactions .",
    "there may well be other operators generated , but these are the operators of most interest for the generation of mass .",
    "these operators have differing flavor structure , as indicated by the sprinkling of the @xmath38 s , and this results in nontrivial mass matrices , to which we now turn .",
    "we first consider @xmath40 blocks of the full @xmath41 mass matrices .",
    "the @xmath42@xmath2 submatrix , in terms of the original fields , is @xmath43 the operators as labeled above contribute in the following way .",
    "@xmath44 note that these elements are being fed down from the @xmath45 mass .",
    "similarly the @xmath46 mass is feeding down to the @xmath47 and @xmath48 masses as follows .",
    "@xmath49    not only do we get a diverse set of operators with different structures emerging from a fairly simple starting point , but each operator contributes to a different element of a mass matrix .",
    "we see only one common element in the up- and down - type matrices , and thus @xmath2@xmath48 mass splitting is permitted .",
    "in addition , the different off - diagonal elements imply nontrivial mass mixing between the 2nd and 3rd families . but",
    "the main point about the way masses are being generated here is the way the dynamics generates mass hierarchies .",
    "for example the generation of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 operators are favored because among the operators we have listed , only they are singlets under @xmath23 .",
    "more importantly , the operators experience different amounts of anomalous scaling , due to the remnant @xmath22 interaction , as they are run down from scale @xmath52 where they are created , to a tev .",
    "we expect that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 operators are enhanced the most while the @xmath53 operator is enhanced the least . in particular at one - loop ,",
    "the @xmath22 corrections enhance the @xmath50 and @xmath51 operators , they cancel out for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 operators , and they resist the @xmath53 operator .",
    "the following hierarchy follows .",
    "@xmath56    what we have not explained is the origin of the @xmath2@xmath48 mass splitting .",
    "that must be due to the larger size of the @xmath57 operators compared to the @xmath58 operators , due to physics at the high scale .",
    "this could for example be related to a dynamical breakdown of @xmath59 in an otherwise left - right symmetric theory .",
    "but whatever the origin of the isospin breaking , it is manifested at a tev in various 4-fermion operators .",
    "we find that the most dominant of these operators do not feed directly into @xmath60 ; in fact four insertions of the dominant @xmath50 operator is necessary to produce a contribution to @xmath60.@xcite this produces a suppression factor of order @xmath61 .",
    "it may be checked that other possible operators contributing to @xmath62 are not of the form which is strongly enhanced by the @xmath34 scaling effect .",
    "this applies to the @xmath8 operators mentioned in the introduction , which in the present case corresponds to operators with four fourth - family quarks . in particular it is not possible to write these operators as a product of lorentz scalars which are neutral under @xmath34 .",
    "we thus see how the dynamics protects @xmath62 from the isospin breaking physics responsible for the large @xmath2 mass .",
    "we return to the question of the breakdown of @xmath22 , where we note that this symmetry is broken by the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath53 operators . since these operators are arising dynamically , the implication is a dynamical contribution to the @xmath25 boson mass .",
    "what contribution does a 4-fermion condensate give to a gauge boson mass ? using naive dimensional analysis@xcite ( which tries to keep track of 4@xmath63 factors in loops ) it has been argued@xcite that it is natural to expect a contribution to the mass over coupling of the gauge boson , @xmath64 , an order of magnitude or two less than the natural scale of the operator . in other words , 4-fermion condensates seem to produce a softer breaking of gauge symmetries than do 2-fermion condensates .",
    "in this way we find that @xmath64 for the @xmath25-boson could be as low as a tev or so .",
    "we may introduce leptons in the same way as quarks , such that under @xmath65 @xmath66 operators of interest involving leptons are as listed .",
    "( we do not consider operators involving right - handed neutrinos , since the latter may not exist in the theory at a tev . )",
    "@xmath67 these operators respect all gauge symmetries , like the @xmath50 operators . and",
    "as we shall show , the @xmath68 and @xmath69 operators make additional contributions to the quark masses if the @xmath70 mass corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore assume that that is the case .",
    "it turns out that the operators in ( [ r2 ] ) , along with our previous operators , are sufficient to break all global symmetries .",
    "this removes the necessity of some kind of quark - lepton unification at relatively low scales , and thus allows the standard @xmath72 ( or left - right symmetric version ) to survive to high scales .",
    "since the fermions of our model come in standard model families , the relative running of the @xmath73 couplings remains the same to lowest order in these couplings , to _ all _ orders in the new strong interactions .",
    "thus there remains the tendency for the three couplings to become closer at high energies .",
    "in other words , if there is some form of coupling constant unification then the observed values of the three couplings are not completely accidental in this picture in spite of new strong interactions .",
    "we may now display the full up- and down - type mass matrices .",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 the @xmath76 entry is the dynamical fourth - family quark mass in ( [ bb ] ) .",
    "the other new entries in the up - type matrix are due to the quark - lepton operators , which are feeding mass down from the @xmath70 .",
    "note that the matrix is in general not symmetric .",
    "we are postulating that most of the km mixing angles have their origin in the up - mass matrix .",
    "in particular cabibbo mixing is due mostly to the @xmath77 entry , while the small size of the @xmath78 mass is due to the smaller @xmath79 entry .    in the down - type matrix ,",
    "the @xmath80 entry is due to an operator similar to the @xmath53 operator , but which is feeding mass down from the @xmath2 rather than the @xmath46 .",
    "( the @xmath80 entry in the up - type matrix is negligible since it is feeding down from the @xmath48 . )",
    "this leads to the mass relation @xmath81 it is rather novel to find that the @xmath78 mass is being fed down from the @xmath70 , while the @xmath82 is being fed down from the @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath83 operator , and perhaps the @xmath53 and @xmath80 operators as well , may be arising through loops involving other operators we have listed .",
    "it may be shown that mass matrices of the above form have sufficient structure to produce realistic quark masses and mixings .    in the lepton sector",
    "we are able to identify 4-fermion operators which could give mass to the charged leptons .",
    "the small mass of left - handed neutrinos is probably associated with a large mass for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "but we are unable to make predictions for the three light neutrino masses other than that they are unlikely to be much smaller than an ev .",
    "we return to the point that the @xmath53 entry is the same for the up- and down - type matrices , which is due to the fact that the @xmath53 operator is intrinsically isospin conserving . to avoid unnatural cancellation in the @xmath48@xmath47 mass matrix ,",
    "this entry should be of order the @xmath47 mass .",
    "this means that the @xmath42 mass must be due mostly to @xmath42@xmath2 mixing induced by the @xmath54 and @xmath55 entries .",
    "these entries are thus of order @xmath84 , and this in turn has an interesting phenomenological consequence .",
    "if we take one of our operators and close off the @xmath46 or @xmath45 lines we get a contribution to the quark mass matrix .",
    "if we also attach a photon or @xmath1 to the heavy quark loop then we generate an anomalous magnetic - moment - type coupling ; in particular we can get the flavor - changing coupling @xmath85 since the size of this operator is closely related to the corresponding off - diagonal mass elements , we estimate that its coefficient is of order @xmath86 where @xmath87tev .",
    "this is larger than the conventional etc estimate , since etc mass operators do not directly generate these couplings .",
    "it is also larger than estimates based on multi - higgs models , since in that case the new coupling requires an extra loop compared to the tree - level mass .    this coupling yields @xmath88 with an magnitude which is just barely detectable at lep2 , and easily detectable at 500 gev .",
    "chromomagnetic moments may also be considered , and in that case the flavor - diagonal anomalous coupling of a gluon to top quarks may be of interest to the production of top quarks in hadron colliders .",
    "generic to this picture are the remnant flavor interactions , which implies at least one new massive gauge boson coupling to the third family with a mass as low as a tev.@xcite in the minimal model this is the @xmath25-boson , and we find that it mixes with the @xmath1 . as we have described it , the @xmath25-boson has axial couplings to the @xmath2 and @xmath48 quarks and vector couplings to the @xmath89 . for the @xmath70 mass ]",
    "the mixing then results in the following wide range of fractional shifts in various electroweak parameters , which occur in the ratios , @xmath90 @xmath91 the magnitude of the shift of the @xmath1 coupling to a third family fermion is @xmath92 @xmath93 is determined from the @xmath2 loop with an effective tev cutoff supplied by the momentum dependence of the @xmath2 mass .",
    "for example , an observed 2% shift in @xmath94 or a 20% shift in @xmath95 would imply that @xmath96 what is perhaps most surprising is that such large anomalies have not yet been completely ruled out .",
    "extracted from the forward - backward lepton asymmetries at lep.@xcite ]    we note in passing that the new flavor physics is not associated ( at least in the minimal @xmath97 picture presented here ) with any kind of new confining interaction .",
    "this new flavor physics could be quite different from qcd - like dynamics and the implied @xmath98-like resonance typically expected in theories of dynamical symmetry breaking .    and",
    "finally , this picture leads a fourth left - handed neutrino , with a dynamical mass expected to be comparable to the other fourth - family members . assuming that the right - handed neutrino is either absent or much heavier , we are left to consider a large majorana mass for the left - handed neutrino .",
    "this might seem to be a disaster for electroweak corrections , and for this reason the effects of majorana masses are normally only considered for right - handed neutrinos.@xcite but this expectation is not correct , at least for some range of masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the contributions to @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 from fourth family leptons @xmath102 ( we omit the underlines ) for a range of masses @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the result for @xmath100 depends on the effective cutoff in the neutrino loop ( again supplied by the momentum dependence of the dynamical mass ) and we have used @xmath105 and @xmath106 . from figs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we see ranges of masses for which the new contributions to @xmath100 are negative with reasonable size , while the new contributions to @xmath99 and @xmath101 are simultaneously small .",
    "we therefore have a source of negative @xmath100 within the dynamical symmetry breaking context .",
    "this may be useful , given the fact that other new contributions to @xmath100 in this context are typically positive .",
    "in conclusion , we have described a picture in which flavor physics originates at a scale of order 100 or 1000 tev .",
    "we have emphasized the role that anomalous scaling of 4-fermion operators can have in transforming the flavor physics at this scale into the complicated pattern of observed fermion masses .",
    "we present here an extension of the minimal model which may have more appealing dynamics . in particular",
    "we replace the @xmath34 with @xmath107 .",
    "each third and fourth family fermion is now one member of an @xmath108 triplet .",
    "we also expand color into a direct product of @xmath109 s , such that under the gauge symmetry @xmath110 the third and fourth family quarks are members of the following representations .",
    "@xmath111 the symmetry in ( [ r1 ] ) is not a symmetry of the @xmath112 and @xmath113 operators , and as before we assume that the gauge bosons corresponding to the broken generators have masses in the tev range .",
    "the symmetry left unbroken by the @xmath112 and @xmath114 operators is @xmath115 , where the former is a `` metacolor '' and the latter is standard color .",
    "we may assume that @xmath116 is strong enough to help induce the @xmath116 conserving and @xmath107 violating condensate @xmath117 .",
    "the condensate lies in the * 6 * of @xmath108 , and it can be transformed to the given ` 11 ' form .",
    "the result is the fourth family quark masses in ( [ bb ] ) , and the main point is that there is now an obviously attractive gauge interaction in this channel .",
    "since @xmath118 is likely weaker than @xmath119 in order to get the correct @xmath120 , the ` broken - color ' interactions will end up coupling more strongly to the second and fourth families than to the first and third . as for metacolor",
    ", we assume it grows strong somewhat below a tev and that it confines the two families of metafermions .",
    "if metafermions become massive then they make an unwelcome contribution to the @xmath99 parameter . on the other hand their chiral symmetries",
    "are already explicitly broken by the broken gauge interactions , and thus the confined metafermions could remain massless due to unbroken discrete chiral symmetries without constraints from chiral anomalies.@xcite    this whole structure can easily be incorporated into the larger gauge group present at 100 or 1000 tev .",
    "the @xmath108 becomes embedded into @xmath121 , which acts also on the two light families .",
    "all the 4-fermion operators we have considered may be chosen to transform as singlets under an @xmath122 subgroup of @xmath121 , disjoint from the unbroken @xmath123 subgroup .",
    "the operators are singlets under this @xmath122 subgroup in the same way they were singlets under the @xmath39 of the minimal model",
    ". it may be checked that they are therefore in attractive channels with respect to @xmath121 ( even though they do not respect @xmath121 ) , just as they were in attractive channels with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "finally we note that the fermion content of the model implies that @xmath121 may be a candidate for a nontrivial infrared fixed point according to the analysis in ref . @xcite .",
