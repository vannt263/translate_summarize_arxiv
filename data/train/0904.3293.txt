    "in recent times cosmology has become an accurately testable branch of physics .",
    "theoretical models can now be confronted with a large quantity of high - precision data coming from different sources , including studies of distant supernovae @xcite , the anisotropies of the cmb @xcite or the lss of the universe @xcite .",
    "all these observations give strong support to the existence of de , although the ultimate nature of this component remains a complete mystery .",
    "remarkably enough , the simplest de candidate , namely a cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath0 , gives rise to a model ( @xmath0cdm ) in accurate agreement with all the currently available observational data .",
    "moreover , a general prediction of quantum field theory ( qft ) is the existence of a vacuum energy which would precisely take the form of a cc in the einstein equations .",
    "however , the value predicted by the theory happens to be many orders of magnitude larger than the observed de density .",
    "this fact , known as the `` cosmological constant problem '' @xcite , makes very unlikely the identification of de with a strictly constant vacuum energy density , since that would require an extremely fine - tuned cancellation of the different contributions , unless there is a dynamical mechanism taking care of such adjustment @xcite . in a different vein , the cc problem can also be addressed in quantum cosmology models of inflation , through the idea of multiverses@xcite and the application of anthropic considerations @xcite .",
    "the cc problem could be alleviated if we allow the de to be dynamical .",
    "the most popular models exploiting this idea are undoubtedly the scalar field models ( xcdm)@xcite . these models , although well - motivated from the particle physics point of view , present two major drawbacks .",
    "first of all , the field should have an extremely tiny mass , @xmath1 ev , which is even much smaller than the observed value of the mass scale associated to the de ( @xmath2{\\rho_{d}}\\sim 10^{-3}$ ] ev ) . and",
    "second , in this kind of models one implicitly assumes that the vacuum energy predicted by qft cancels out for some reason , so the fine - tuning problems associated to the vacuum energy are not solved but simply obviated and traded for those of the scalar field itself . in short , the situation is as follows : on the one hand , from qft we expect a vacuum energy contribution to the de in the form of a cc ; on the other , we have the popular and well - motivated scalar field models , which may serve to alleviate the cc problem due to their dynamical nature .",
    "therefore , it seems quite natural to study a more complete model in which the de combines both ingredients , which we call the @xmath0xcdm model @xcite .",
    "the new model presents additional advantages : e.g. @xmath0 need not be constant , but may evolve with a renormalization group ( rg ) equation , as any other parameter in qft .",
    "the other de component , the `` cosmon '' @xmath3 , need not be a fundamental field either ; it could be e.g. an effective representation of dynamical fields of various sorts or even of higher order curvature terms in the action . in fact we do not have to assume anything about the nature of @xmath3 : its dynamics",
    "is completely determined from that of @xmath0 once we have a good ansatz for the latter , due to the fact that both components may exchange energy . in the original @xmath0xcdm model@xcite ,",
    "the result of these assumptions is a 3-parameter cosmological framework which incorporates the @xmath0cdm and xcdm models as special cases .",
    "one of the most appealing features of the @xmath0xcdm model is that it provides a solution to the `` cosmological coincidence problem''@xcite , i.e. the problem of explaining why the energy densities of matter and de are currently of the same order . in the standard @xmath0cdm model",
    ", this fact is indeed a coincidence since the evolution of the two components is very different ; namely , while the de density remains constant , the matter density decays fast with the scale factor as @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath0xcdm model , the ratio @xmath5 between the de and matter densities may be bounded and not vary too far away from @xmath6 for a significant fraction of the history of the universe .",
    "it means that , for a very long time , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stay naturally of the same order as they are nowadays .",
    "recently , a generalized version of the @xmath0xcdm model has been suggested in ref .   with even more far reaching consequences ,",
    "namely it is able to relax the value of the de in the present universe starting from an arbitrary value in the early epochs , i.e. it constitutes an interesting attempt to solve the old cc problem without using the traditional adjustment mechanisms based on scalar fields@xcite .",
    "whatever its nature , if the de is not a strict cc , then , according to cosmological perturbation theory , it should fluctuate . in order to find out its impact on the lss formation",
    ", we will discuss some generic properties of the de perturbations , exemplifying them by means of the @xmath0xcdm model .",
    "we will also address the question of how the lss data can be used to constrain a model .",
    "the information about lss is encoded in the galaxy fluctuation power spectrum , @xmath9 , which is determined observationally and must be reproduced by the predicted matter power spectrum latexmath:[$p(k)\\equiv    approach to the problem is to simply neglect de perturbations .",
    "using the fact that the @xmath0cdm model provides a good fit to the data , we may take it as a reference and impose that the power spectrum of our model does not deviate by more than @xmath11 from the @xmath0cdm value ( `` f - test''@xcite ) .",
    "as we will see , this simple analysis may serve to strongly restrict the parameter space of a model .",
    "nevertheless , it does not reflect some important features that only come to light when making a full study of the combined system of matter and de perturbations .",
    "we will show that such a study@xcite is useful not only to check the validity of the previous approach , but it can also help us to further constrain the physical region of the parameter space .",
    "the net result of our analysis of the de perturbations and its implication on lss formation is quite rewarding , as we are able to find a sizable region of the @xmath0xcdm parameter space where the model is in full agreement with lss data , and other cosmological observations , while providing at the same time a plausible dynamical solution to the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "in this section , we discuss some general properties of the de perturbations for models in which both matter and de are self - conserved : @xmath12 here a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the scale factor ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 stands for each of the energy components , matter / radiation and de .",
    "we take @xmath15 , since we are interested in studying the perturbations in the matter - dominated ( md ) era , and we denote the equation of state ( eos ) of the de component as @xmath16 , where the subindex `` @xmath17 '' serves us to remember that the eos may be an effective one .",
    "let us first introduce the basic equations for the fluctuations , which we derive following the standard approach @xcite .",
    "for the background space - time we adopt the spatially flat flrw metric , @xmath18 .",
    "we perturb it @xmath19 keeping only the scalar part of the perturbation . in order to have uniquely defined fluctuations @xmath20 ,",
    "a gauge choice is mandatory , i.e. we have to choose a specific coordinate system . here",
    "we adopt the synchronous gauge@xcite , for which @xmath21 .",
    "we should also perturb the energy - momentum tensor , considering thus perturbations on the density , pressure and 4-velocity of each fluid : @xmath22 the equations for the fluctuations are then obtained by perturbing the 00-component of the einstein equations , @xmath23 , and the conservation law for the energy momentum - tensor , @xmath24 . at the end",
    "we obtain 5 equations depending on the following set of 7 variables : @xmath25 therefore , in order to solve our system we need to give an expression for @xmath26 ( since for the matter component , indeed @xmath27 ) . in the case of adiabatic perturbations",
    ", we simply have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the adiabatic speed of sound of the de fluid . in general , however , there could be an entropy contribution to the pressure perturbation . in this case , the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath30 in an arbitrary system of reference is given as follows@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rest - frame ( or _ effective _ ) speed of sound and @xmath33 is the wave number , as we have moved to fourier space .",
    "this expression is gauge - invariant , and thus it can be computed in any desired gauge , in particular in the synchronous one .",
    "when @xmath7 is self - conserved , equation ( [ conservation ] ) holds for @xmath7 and , in such case , ( [ pentropy ] ) takes on the form @xmath34 finally , the equations for the perturbations read : @xmath35\\label{ode}\\\\ & & \\de_m^\\prime = -\\frac{1}{ah}\\left(\\theta_m-\\frac{\\hh}{2}\\right)\\\\ & & \\theta_m^\\prime = - \\frac{2}{a}\\theta_m\\\\ & & \\de^{\\,\\prime}_d = - \\frac{(1+{\\omega_e})}{ah}\\left\\{\\left[1+\\frac{9a^2h^2(\\csd-\\cad ) } { k^2 } \\right]\\theta_d-\\frac{\\hh}{2}\\right\\}-\\frac{3}{a}(\\csd-{\\omega_e})\\de_d\\qquad \\label{ode1}\\\\ & & { \\theta}^{\\prime}_d=-\\frac{1}{a}\\left(2 - 3\\csd\\right){\\theta}_d+\\frac{k^2}{a^3h } \\frac{\\csd\\de_d}{(1+{\\omega_e})}\\ , , \\label{ode2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from these equations",

    "this equation is much simpler if we use differentiation with respect to the conformal time @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and work in the comoving gauge .",
    "notice that gauge issues are unimportant for sub - hubble perturbations , as the ones we study here , so the behavior of the perturbations will not depend on the chosen gauge . defining the expansion rate in the conformal time @xmath43 ,",
    "the counterpart of eq.([secm ] ) in the comoving gauge reads @xcite : @xmath44\\mathcal{h } \\dot{\\delta}+3\\bigg[\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\omega_e^2 - 4\\omega_e-\\frac{1}{2}+3c_a^2\\right)\\mathcal{h}^2+\\frac{k^2}{3}c_s^2\\bigg]\\delta=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{secd}\\ ] ]      once we have shown the basic equations , let us discuss some general properties of the de perturbations",
    ". looking at , we see that the coefficient of @xmath45 presents two terms . if it is the second of these terms ( the one proportional to @xmath46 ) that dominates , and forgetting for a moment about the term proportional to @xmath47 , we are left with the equation of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this defines the _ sound horizon _ , a `` jeans scale '' for the de , @xmath48 such that for scales well inside it , i.e. @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants , and we have assumed constant @xmath32 for simplicity . therefore , we see that :    if @xmath53 , the perturbations grow exponentially , situation which is unacceptable for structure formation .",
    "as long as @xmath54 is not varying too fast , @xmath55 [ cf .",
    "] , so in general the perturbations can not be adiabatic .    if @xmath56 , the perturbations oscillate .",
    "when we take into account the @xmath47 term , what we have is a damped harmonic oscillator , and thus the oscillations have decaying amplitude .",
    "as the matter perturbations grow typically as @xmath57 , this ensures that @xmath58 , i.e. that de will be a smooth component , as usually assumed .",
    "nevertheless , the larger the scale @xmath59 or the smaller the speed of sound @xmath32 , the more important de perturbations are , because then @xmath60 is not such a good approximation .    now",
    "the question is whether the scales relevant for the matter power spectrum are really inside the sound horizon or not .",
    "the linear regime of the power spectrum lies in the range 0.01@xmath61mpc@xmath62mpc@xmath63 or , equivalently @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "we expect@xcite that at present @xmath65 .",
    "thus we conclude that ( at least for @xmath32 not too close to 0 ) , the scales relevant for the observations of lss are well below the sound horizon , and so the features previously described apply to them .    inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ ode1 ] ) and ( [ ode2 ] ) reveals another important property of the de perturbations : they diverge if the eos of the de acquires the value @xmath66 ( known as the `` cc boundary '' ) , i.e. if the de changes from quintessence - like ( qe ) behavior ( @xmath67 ) to phantom ( @xmath68 ) or vice versa .",
    "note that , even though @xmath69 diverges at the crossing [ cf .",
    "( [ cadas ] ) ] , @xmath70 remains finite and , therefore , eq . ( [ ode1 ] ) is well - behaved .",
    "thus , the problem lies exclusively in the @xmath71 factor in the denominator of ( [ ode2 ] ) and only disappears for vanishing sound of speed @xmath32 .",
    "one can argue that the physical source of momentum transfer is not @xmath72 but @xmath73 , with @xmath74@xcite , and hope to get rid of the divergence through such a redefinition of variables , but unfortunately this is not the case .",
    "getting around this difficulty is not always possible , and in fact there is no way for a single scalar field ( or single fluid ) model to cross the cc boundary @xcite , and even with two fields some very special conditions should be arranged . in the absence of a mechanism to avoid this singularity ,",
    "we are forced to restrict our parameter space by removing the points that present such a crossing in the past .",
    "the properties discussed in the previous section apply in principle to any model in which the de is self - conserved . the @xmath0xcdm model , introduced in ref .   as a possible explanation to the cosmological coincidence problem , constitutes a non - trivial example of these kind of models . in it ,",
    "the de is a composite fluid , constituted by a variable cc and another generic component @xmath3 , which can exchange energy with @xmath75 : @xmath76 the evolution of @xmath0 can be ( as any parameter in qft ) tied to the rg in curved space - time @xcite : @xmath77 where we identified @xmath78 ( the energy scale associated to the rg in cosmology ) with the hubble function @xmath79 at any epoch and @xmath80 is a free , dimensionless , parameter related to the mass ratio ( squared ) of the heavy particles contributing to the running versus the planck mass@xcite . while the ultimate justification for this ansatz is the application of the rg method and the general considerations of covariance of the effective action in qft in curved space - time ,",
    "a more profound study is needed , see refs .   and ( section vi of the latter ) for a more detailed discussion .",
    "interestingly enough , the evolution law ( [ lam1 ] ) can be tested from different points of view@xcite , including cosmological perturbations @xcite(see also refs .   and for related phenomenological studies ) .",
    "it should be clear that , in spite of the dynamical nature of @xmath0 , its eos parameter is @xmath81 , and it is in this sense that we may call it a `` cosmological constant '' . as for the @xmath3 component , we assume that it has a constant eos lying in the range @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 is small ) . we need not make any assumption about the nature of the cosmon , since its evolution becomes determined by that of the cc through the energy conservation equation : @xmath84 the solution of the model in the md era can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ lam1 ] ) , ( [ lam2 ] ) and the friedmann equation : @xmath85\\,,\\label{fri}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 . for the normalized de density ,",

    "assuming as a prior that @xmath89 , we are left with 3 free parameters : @xmath80 , the parameter that controls the running of @xmath0 ; @xmath90 , the barotropic index of the @xmath3 component ; and @xmath91 , the current energy density of the cc .",
    "let us note that the model includes as special cases both the @xmath0cdm ( @xmath92 ) and xcdm ( @xmath93 ) models .",
    "the effective eos parameter of the model , @xmath94 can present a variety of behaviors@xcite compatible with @xmath95 ( the subindex 0 standing for the present value ) , as suggested by observations@xcite .",
    "in order to understand why the @xmath0xcdm model can provide an explanation for the coincidence problem , it is convenient to consider the ratio @xmath96 between the de and matter energy densities , which in the standard @xmath0cdm model reads : @xmath97 we see that @xmath96 tends to zero in the past and grows unboundedly in the future . only at the present time we have @xmath98 .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion seems to be that we live in a very special moment , namely one very close to the time when the expansion of the universe started to be accelerated .",

    "it is important to note that the ability to solve the coincidence problem is a very general feature of the model . in order to show that",
    ", let us recall that the solution to the coincidence problem is linked to the existence of a future stopping of the universe expansion@xcite .",
    "now , from the friedmann equation ( [ fri ] ) , it is clear that it is necessary that the de density becomes negative for the expansion to stop . but this condition can be realized even in the simplest setups of the @xmath0xcdm model .",
    "let us assume e.g. that @xmath102 , so there is no exchange of energy between the cc and the @xmath3 component : @xmath103 in this case we have a truly constant @xmath0 and the cosmon behaves effectively as a qe / phantom scalar field ; @xmath104 will eventually become negative if any of the following conditions is fulfilled : @xmath105 let us also stress that in the @xmath0xcdm the individual components are not observable , the only thing we can measure is the total @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , there is no problem in having a negative value for @xmath91 or @xmath106 , as long as @xmath107 .",
    "remember also that @xmath3 need not be a real fluid , its nature could be effective .    in a",
    "we show that there is a large 3d - volume of the parameter space for which this solution to the coincidence problem is possible ( the projections of that volume onto three orthogonal planes are shown as the shaded regions in b , c , d . )",
    "all the points in it present a relatively low maximum of the ratio @xmath96 ( @xmath108 , ratio that , in addition , is small enough at the nucleosynthesis epoch ( @xmath109 , where in this case @xmath110 is the density of radiation and @xmath111 is to be computed in the radiation - dominated era ) , so as to make sure that the predictions of the big bang model are not spoiled .",
    "+     [ figui ]",
    "in this section we address the problem of how the parameter space of a model can be constrained by means of lss data , using as an example the @xmath0xcdm model . as we saw in , at the scales relevant to the linear part of the matter power spectrum the de perturbations",

    "most remarkably , the lss data point to the value @xmath119 , to within a 10% accuracy , for the @xmath0cdm model@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the comparison to the @xmath0cdm can be a valid and more economical criterion for studying the viability of a model .",
    "in particular , we may require that any de model should pass the following `` f - test''@xcite : @xmath120 this was done for the @xmath0xcdm model ( and also for the running cc model@xcite ) in ref .  , where , in addition , we imposed that the current value of the eos parameter of the de should be close to -1 : @xmath121 as suggested by recent observational limits@xcite@xmath122 and , therefore ,",

    ", there is still a sizable region of the parameter space ( medium and dark - shaded regions ) where the @xmath0xcdm satisfies these two new conditions and the nucleosynthesis bound , while still providing a solution to the coincidence problem .",
    "neglecting de perturbations provides us therefore with a simple and effective method to constrain the parameter space of a model .",
    "although we expect it to be a reasonable approximation , we can not be completely sure unless we perform a full analysis in which the de fluctuations are also included .",
    "such an analysis@xcite implies an immediate and very important consequence .",
    "as discussed in , if the effective eos of the model crosses the cc boundary ( @xmath123 ) at some point in the past , the perturbation equations will diverge . in the absence of a mechanism to get around this singularity ( and",
    "indeed we can not have it without a microscopic definition of the @xmath3 component , i.e. one that goes beyond a mere conservation law ) , we are forced to restrict our parameter space by removing the points that present such a crossing .",
    "this new constraint knocks off many of the points allowed by the previous simple analysis ; in fact , we are left with the dark - shaded region in b , c , d , and so we end up with a rather definite prediction for the values of the parameters of the @xmath0xcdm model .",
    "it is worth noticing that only small ( and positive ) values of @xmath80 are allowed , @xmath124 at most , which is in very good agreement with theoretical expectations@xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of the new constraint is that the effective eos of the de can be qe - like only@xcite , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "we want to compare the matter power spectrum predicted by the @xmath0xcdm model , @xmath126 , with the @xmath9cdm spectrum , @xmath127 , which provides a good fit to @xmath9 ] measured by the 2dfgrs collaboration@xcite .",
    "the former can be found by evolving the perturbation equations ( [ ode])-([ode2 ] ) from @xmath113 to @xmath115 , where in this case @xmath129 is the scale factor at some time well after recombination . in order to set the initial conditions , we took into account that the de does not begin to play an important role until very recently , so that the values of the metric and matter perturbations at @xmath113 should be the same for our model and for the @xmath0cdm model  the power spectrum @xmath127 of the latter being available from standard analytical fits in the literature , see ref .   and references therein . as for the de perturbations",
    ", we assumed that they vanish at @xmath113 .",
    "this is reasonable because , as noticed before , the de perturbations are expected to be negligible at the scales relevant to the linear part of the matter power spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0xcdm power spectrum was calculated for two different fiducial sound speeds , @xmath130 and @xmath131 and several combinations of the parameters @xmath80 , @xmath132 and @xmath91 . for values of the parameters _ not _ fulfilling the f - test ( even though satisfying all the other conditions stated in ) we obtain huge discrepancies , as expected .",
    "the discrepancy appears as an approximate global suppression gap ( in the entire @xmath33 range ) of the amount of growth with respect to the @xmath0cdm model ( cf .",
    "this suppression is typical of the qe - like behavior@xcite and occurs even if the de perturbations are neglected ( dotted line ) , in which case @xmath126 presents exactly the same shape as @xmath127 ( because then the @xmath33-dependence disappears from the equations , which reduce just to ) .",
    "the effect of considering de perturbations is only visible at large scales ( small @xmath33 ) , where they tend to compensate the aforementioned suppression .",
    "the smaller the speed of sound or the larger the scale , the more important is the effect of de perturbations , as expected from the general considerations of .",
    "in contrast , in a we see that for values allowed by the f - test ( and satisfying all the other constraints as well , i.e. lying in the dark - shaded region in b , c , d ) , @xmath126 is very similar to @xmath127 , with numerical results in very good agreement with those obtained through the f - method@xcite . in particular , their shape is identical , indicating that de perturbations do not play a role here .",
    "indeed , in a we see that @xmath40 oscillates with decreasing amplitude , as predicted in . for positive sound speed ,",
    "the perturbations get stabilized ( and therefore the ratio @xmath133 becomes negligible ) once the sound horizon ( [ po ] ) is crossed , i.e. when @xmath134 , as seen in b. similarly , in the adiabatic case , the perturbations begin their exponential growth once @xmath69 ( which is negligible in the far past in the @xmath0xcdm model@xcite ) eventually takes a sizable negative value .",
    "the runaway behavior is triggered by the term proportional to @xmath135 in ( [ ode2 ] ) , or equivalently in ( [ secd ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of the de perturbations in models with self - conserved de . we have exemplified them by means of the @xmath0xcdm model@xcite , which is a non - trivial model of the cosmic evolution with a number of appealing properties . unlike other proposed solutions to the coincidence problem ( an incomplete list includes tracking scalar fields , interactive qe models , k - essence , chaplygin gas , etc - see e.g. ref .   and references therein )",
