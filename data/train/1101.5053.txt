    "organic semiconductors ( oscs ) demonstrate a number of interesting properties , which distinguish them from crystalline inorganic semiconductors @xcite . among the most intriguing features",
    "is the possibility of electrochemical doping by means of reversible redox reactions , demonstrated in a number of materials @xcite .",
    "the electrochemical doping transforms the oscs from essentially insulating state to a metallic - like state with the conductivity increased by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this transformation is accompanied by a considerable change of the material properties including color , photoluminescence capability , volume , and surface energy @xcite .",
    "the electrochemical doping can be performed straightforward _ in situ _",
    ", when an osc coated on a metal electrode is in contact with an electrolyte and is subjected to an appropriate electric potential . in the transformation process , electronic charges ( electrons and holes ) from the electrode",
    "are injected into the osc and subsequently electrostatically compensated by an influx of respective ions from the electrolyte ( cations and anions ) @xcite .",
    "the opportunity for tuning the electronic and optical properties of oscs has triggered a number of studies at the fundamental as well as practical aspects of doping .",
    "these works in turn paved the way to numerous applications of this process in novel electronic and photonic devices @xcite .",
    "a classical example of the electronic devices utilizing the electrochemical doping is polymer based light - emitting electrochemical cells ( lecs ) @xcite .",
    "a lec comprises an organic semiconductor in a form of conjugated fluorescent polymer , which is blended with a solid state electrolyte .",
    "the blend of the conjugated polymer and the electrolyte forms the active material of the lec and is sandwiched between two electrodes .",
    "when an electric potential applied between the electrodes exceeds the band gap potential of the conjugated polymer , then the doping transformation starts with injected holes and electrons forming the p- and n - type doped regions close to the respective electrodes @xcite .",
    "the doping process in planar lecs can be visualized under ultra - violet illumination since doped oscs display very high rate of photoluminescence quenching .",
    "the doped material in lec is observed as dark regions quite distinct from the original undoped substance . by employing the ultra - violet visualization ,",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally that doping transformation in osc develops in the form of two localized fronts of p- and n - type doping , which emerge at the electrodes and propagate towards each other @xcite .",
    "when the fronts meet , the two doped regions form a p - n junction , which emits a visible light .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide a theoretical model for the front propagation in lecs prior to the development of the p - n junction .",
    "a number of interesting theoretical works has been devoted to charge dynamics in lecs and other osc devices @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors of refs . investigated a stationary light - emitting p - n junction as a final state of the doping process in lecs . at this stage of the process",
    ", the whole osc is already converted to the state with high conductivity . however , the non - steady problem of doping front dynamics and structure prior to the formation of the p - n junction is much more difficult to analyze , since it involves transition of the ocs from the undoped weakly conducting state to the metallic - like doped state within the front . as we show in the present paper ,",
    "the problem includes not only the electrodynamic issues of the osc plasma motion , but also some questions of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics , which are still waiting for an answer .",
    "the problem of front dynamics was addressed in from the empirical point of view of total osc conduction : the purpose was to analyze the experimental data without investigating the complicated internal front properties . at the same time",
    ", considerable progress has been achieved in the adjacent problem of front dynamics in one - electrode osc devices , such as e.g. electrochemical sensors and actuators @xcite .",
    "for example , the recent work by wang et al .",
    "@xcite provided discussion of all elements required for front formation in the one - electrode devices . the model proposed in ref .",
    "included the poisson equation , diffusion and mobility ( migration ) of holes and ions ( cathions ) , taking into account possible nonlinear ( non - fickian ) character of the transport coefficients .",
    "the nernst equation for light particles , holes , in the region of high conductivity in that case follows from the diffusion - mobility model under the condition of quasi - equilibrium . in a sense ,",
    "the process studied in ref .",
    "is just the opposite to the doping fronts propagating in lecs . in the doping process in lecs",
    ", holes and electrons are injected into the active material by an externally applied electrical field , which helps them overcoming a certain thermodynamic barrier , and dope the active material .",
    "the ions , on the other hand , give way to the light charges , and compensate the excessive charge thus avoiding generation of strong internal electric fields . in the devices presented by wang at al .",
    "@xcite charge motion goes in the opposite direction : the cathions advance together with the front , while holes retreat leaving the material . with some caution ,",
    "the fronts of electrochemical transformation in lecs and in the one - electrode devices @xcite may be compared to uphill climb and downhill glide , respectively .",
    "still , the physical understanding of front dynamics in the one - electrode devices as presented in @xcite may be helpful in constructing models of the doping front propagation in lecs .",
    "in particular , recent paper @xcite demonstrated that the theoretical description of doping fronts in lecs requires not only the common diffusion - mobility set of equations , but also nonlinear concentration - dependent transport coefficients for holes / electrons and the thermodynamic injection barrier for the light charges in the form of the nernst potential .",
    "the present paper develops the ideas of refs . @xcite . using the theoretical model proposed in @xcite , we study dynamics and internal structure of the doping fronts in lecs . we derive compact analytical formulas for the front velocities depending on the electric field together with the ion concentrations in the doped regions . on the basis of the analytical theory we describe acceleration of the p- and n - fronts approaching each other .",
    "the analytical results show very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we show that the internal structure of the doping fronts is determined by diffusion and mobility processes .",
    "we study analytically the asymptotic behavior of the concentrations and the electrical field inside the doping fronts .",
    "we also solve numerically for the front structure , and confirm the most important predictions of the analytical theory : a sharp head of the front in the undoped region , a smooth relaxation tail in the doped region , and a plateau at the critical point of transition from doped to undoped regions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the basic equations of the model . in sec .",
    "iii we study properties of the doping fronts considered as surfaces of discontinuity ; we find the front velocity and ion concentrations in the doped regions behind the fronts and then describe front acceleration in lecs .",
    "section iv is devoted to the internal structure of the fronts .",
    "we discuss characteristic length scales of the process , the condition of quasi - neutrality , and the necessity of an injection barrier for the system of equations .",
    "we investigate asymptotic analytical solutions to the equations in the specific zones of the front and , finally , we numerically solve the whole set of equations .",
    "the paper is concluded by a brief summary in sec .",
    "in general , the dynamics of the ions is determined by equations of force balance @xmath0 where @xmath1 is charge of positive / negative ions , @xmath2 is ion mass , @xmath3 is concentration , @xmath4 is potential of an electric field with @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the polymer temperature , which may be taken constant and uniform .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) takes the average contribution of collisions into account . in the case of organic polymers ,",

    "the barrier originates from quantum and thermodynamic effects , and the interpretation of @xmath15 in terms of an electrostatic force should therefore be done with caution .",
    "we discuss the necessity of @xmath15 for self - consistent description of the doping front structure and the particular form of this term in the section iv .",
    "meanwhile we point out that this term is non - zero only inside the doping fronts , and it should turn to zero in the uniform undoped and doped material ahead of the fronts and behind the fronts , respectively . the electric field obeys the poisson equation @xmath18 still , in section iv we demonstrate that the condition of quasi - neutrality @xmath19 holds with a very good accuracy in lecs .",
    "we stress that condition ( [ eq8 ] ) _ does not _",
    "mean constant electric field everywhere .",
    "instead , it implies that even tiny local deviations from zero net charge lead to extremely large electric fields .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally @xcite that the doping process in oscs happens in a form of two fronts propagating towards each other as shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . a p - doping front populates the semiconductor with holes , while the n - front makes the semiconductor rich with electrons .",
    "both fronts propagate due to external electric field created by the potential difference between the ends of the semiconductor film . in the present section we consider planar p- and n - fronts as propagating discontinuity surfaces , which transform the original undoped semiconductor to a doped conducting material . to be particular ,",
    "we start our analysis with a stationary p - doping front propagating with velocity @xmath20 along the x - axis in a static and uniform electric @xmath21 , created in the undoped region by external sources . looking for the p - front solution in the form",

    "still , in the limit of discontinuous doping fronts considered in the present section , the barrier term does not play any role , since it is zero in the uniform regions both ahead of the front and behind it .",
    "equations ( [ eq9 ] )  ( [ eq12 ] ) may be integrated analytically across the front .",
    "we designate values ahead of the front by the label `` 0 '' and values behind the front by `` 1 '' .",
    "we also take into account that the hole concentration is zero ahead of the front and it reaches some known finite value @xmath28 behind the front .",
    "the initial concentrations of positive and negative ions are equal and known , @xmath29",
    ". then the parameters in the doped and undoped regions are related by the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq9])-([eq11 ] ) according to @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 equation ( [ eq13 ] ) specifies the electric field in the doped region as @xmath33 , which may be neglected taking into account high mobility of the holes in comparison to the ions in the doped material : @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ eq12 ] ) in the uniform doped region determines zero net charge as @xmath35",
    ". then equations ( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) specify the front velocity and ion concentration in the doped region as @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 similar formulas may be obtained for the n - doping front , i.e. @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where the label `` 2 '' designates the conducting substance behind the n - doping front .",
    "we note that the p- and n - type doping fronts propagate with different velocities related by @xmath42 taking data for electron and hole concentration @xmath43 , @xmath44 obtained in the experiments @xcite we find the velocity of the n - front to be less than that of the p - front with @xmath45 .",
    "next we consider a semiconductor of finite size with a voltage @xmath46 applied to the end electrodes and two planar doping fronts moving towards each other .",
    "the initial distance between the fronts is @xmath47 .",
    "since the distance between the fronts @xmath48 decreases in time and the potential difference is fixed , then electric field @xmath49 in the gap between the fronts grows in time and the fronts accelerate according to eqs .",

    "the markers show the average position of the fronts ; the error bars indicate the difference between the fastest and the slowest parts of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) front structure ( width of the 2d front brush ) .",
    "such 2d structures develop due to front instabilities , which are beyond the scope of the present paper and which will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure 2 indicates that the analytical 1d solution describes the dynamics of the backside of the front structure quite well ( within the 10% accuracy of the experimental data ) . at the same time ,",
    "the leading parts of the front move noticeably faster than the 1d theory predicts .",
    "the last fact demonstrates an important role of the 2d instabilities in the doping front dynamics , which is the subject for the future work .",
    "in the present section we investigate the internal structure of a stationary doping front driven by a constant uniform external electric field @xmath66 .",
    "we start by studying the p - front , since analysis of the n - front is similar .",
    "the internal structure of the doping front is controlled by diffusion in eqs .",

    "still , one has to remember that @xmath70 does not portray the full structure of the doping front .",
    "we show below that there are several different characteristic length scales within the front from the undoped to the doped region",
    ".    we may also estimate the typical deviations from quasi - neutrality within the front through @xmath81 which allows replacing the poisson equation eq .",

    "however , in the geometry of the doping process , the electric and pressure forces point in the same direction ( e.g. to the right in fig",

    "( [ eq36 ] ) suggests that holes are freely accelerated into the semiconductor , which contradicts the very essence of the doping process . in order to obtain a doping front",

    "we point out that the critical point for electrons corresponds to considerably lower mobility ( the critical point for holes is achieved at @xmath214 . because of the lower electron mobility ,",
    "the critical point demonstrates a more complicated structure for the n - front in comparison with the p - front . in the case of the p - front ,",

    ", the front of weak doping transformation may be interpreted as a part of the complete doping front from the head to the critical point .    finally , we present the structure of the p- and n - doping fronts as they accelerate towards each other in fig .",
    "since the characteristic time scales related to the fronts ( that is @xmath218 and @xmath219 are much smaller than the time of the front acceleration , then the structure may be obtained within the quasi - classical wentzel - kramers - brillouin approximation . within this approximation , structure of the fronts",
    "remains self - similar , but the length scales @xmath70 and @xmath220 decrease due to the increase of the electric field and the front velocities @xmath20 and @xmath221 as discussed in sec .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics and internal structure of the planar p- and n - type doping fronts in organic semiconductors with applications to lecs .",
    "the study is based on the drift - diffusion model taking into account the injection barrier and a strongly nonlinear dependence of the hole and electron mobility / diffusion on concentration , following the work ref . .",
    "a similar model has been employed before to describe transformation fronts in one - electrode devices like electrochemical sensors and actuators in ref . .",

    "conductivity of the material _ increases _ drastically , by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude . on the contrary ,",
    "the transformation fronts in ambipolar devices imply that cathions replace holes with strong _ decrease _ of conductivity . the different characters of the processes lead naturally to different properties of the transformation fronts .    here",
    "we have studied parameters of the doping fronts on different scales , both within the discontinuous front approach and also by taking into account the internal front structure . within the limit of a discontinuous front",
    "we have derived the analytical formulas for the front velocities , the ion concentrations in the doped region , and described dynamics of the p- and n - doping fronts accelerating towards each other in lecs .",

    ". theoretical investigation of the front instabilities is beyond the scope of this paper and is presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper was to investigate the internal structure of the doping fronts .",
    "in agreement with the previous ideas @xcite , we show that continuous transition from the doped to undoped state in the form of a moving front requires a thermodynamic injection barrier and a nonlinear dependence of the hole / electron mobility on concentration , which is quite in line with the basic principles of the doping process .",
    "we have studied the asymptotic behavior of the front parameters : 1 ) relaxation to the doped state at the back of the front , 2 ) deviation from the undoped state at the head of the front and 3 ) the critical point of the transition from the doped to undoped parts of the front , where the velocity of the light charges are in resonance with the front speed .",
    "we have also obtained a numerical solution for the front structure . both the analytical theory and the numerical solution demonstrated the multi - scale features of the doping fronts , which include an extremely smooth relaxation tail in the doped region , a sharp head of the front with large gradients in the undoped zone , and a plateau at the critical point .",
