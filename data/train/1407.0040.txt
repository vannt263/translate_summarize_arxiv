    "this difference is far outweighed by the lower variance in local energy of the utp : qmc calculations with a top - hat pseudopotential are approximately nineteen times more costly than calculations with a utp , to obtain the same level of accuracy .",
    "we have developed a high fidelity pseudopotential for the contact interaction inspired by pseudopotentials common in the electronic structure community .",
    "we tested the pseudopotential by examining the scattering phase shifts , the energy of two trapped particles , and the ground state energy of a fermi gas , finding the new pseudopotentials to be approximately one hundred times more accurate for the repulsive branch , and ten times more accurate for the attractive and bound state branches of the feshbach resonance , while also 4000 times more efficient than contemporary approximations .",
    "the pseudopotential delivers accurate scattering properties over all wavevectors @xmath22 in a fermi gas .",
    "its smoothness also greatly accelerates computation : for instance , for the repulsive branch of the feshbach resonance , calculations are accelerated by a factor of at least nineteen .",
    "the performance and transferability of the pseudopotential makes it widely applicable across first principles methods including vmc , dmc , coupled cluster and configuration interaction methods .",
    "the formalism developed can also be applied more widely to generate pseudopotentials for narrow feshbach resonances , the repulsive coulomb interaction , or the dipolar interaction .",
    "the formalism could also be extended by using more projectors , or the ultrasoft  @xcite or augmented plane wave  @xcite formalisms popular in the electronic structure community .",

    "<S> the contact interaction is often used in modeling ultracold atomic gases , although it leads to pathological behavior arising from the divergence of the many - body wavefunction when two particles coalesce . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it difficult to use this model interaction in quantum monte carlo and other popular numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> researchers therefore model the contact interaction with pseudopotentials , such as the square well potential , whose scattering properties deviate markedly from those of the contact potential . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a family of pseudopotentials that reproduce the scattering phase shifts of the contact interaction up to a hundred times more accurately than the square well potential . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the pseudopotentials are smooth , resulting in significant improvements in efficiency when used in numerical calculations .    interactions between particles are central to our understanding of correlated phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the contact potential is often used to model interactions in ultracold atomic gases but , despite its widespread use , it displays pathological behavior : both the potential and wavefunction diverge when two particles coalesce . </S>",
    "<S> these divergences impede numerical methods , and are commonly handled by replacing the contact potential by a pseudopotential , such as a hard sphere or a square well potential . however , these approximations to the contact potential display incorrect variations in the scattering phase shift with incident particle energy  @xcite . in this article , we adapt methods commonly used for the development of electron - ion pseudopotentials in the electronic structure community to propose a new atom - atom pseudopotential whose scattering properties agree closely with those of the contact interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atomic gases have delivered many important insights into strongly correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> they can provide both clean model hamiltonians and introduce the ability to tune the strength of the contact interactions . </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atoms interact through an underlying attractive van der waals interaction . </S>",
    "<S> an external magnetic field can be used to tune the energy of the bound molecular state to approach the energy of the scattering state , causing the states to couple resonantly . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the resonance on the scattering state can be modelled by an effective interparticle potential  @xcite . in the case of broad feshbach resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering can be described by a single universal scattering length @xmath0 which describes the scattering phase shift arising from a contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> there are three types of contact interaction : sufficiently deep to trap a two - body bound state ( @xmath1 ) , weakly attractive with no bound state ( @xmath2 ) , and repulsive ( excited state of the @xmath1 potential ) .    </S>",
    "<S> contemporary numerical simulations of the first two types , the bound state ( @xmath1 ) and weak attractive interactions ( @xmath3 , normally adopt a finite ranged square well or pschl - teller interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such simulations have delivered crucial insights into bose gases  @xcite and the crossover from a gas of weakly coupled bardeen - cooper - schrieffer pairs to a strongly - interacting bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , as well as few - atom physics  @xcite . however , the finite range imbues the potential with incorrect scattering properties . </S>",
    "<S> reducing the range of the potential alleviates this problem , but slows numerical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the third type of contact potential gives repulsive interactions that drive itinerant ferromagnetism in fermi gases  @xcite , a tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite , and a bose gas  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the repulsive interaction emerges from the first excited state of the bound state potential . </S>",
    "<S> both the repulsive contact potential and the bound state potential therefore have @xmath1 . in ultracold atomic gas experiments  @xcite the excited state ( also called the upper branch ) </S>",
    "<S> is protected from decay to the ground state by a slow three - body loss process , allowing the study of repulsive interactions . to simulate these repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> , one can adopt a finite - ranged attractive potential and study the first excited eigenstate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , studying excited states in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods often requires restricting the excited state wavefunction to be orthogonal to the lower energy states . </S>",
    "<S> variational estimates of excited state energies calculated within the widely - used diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) method @xcite are discussed in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed node constraint used in dmc prevents collapse into the ground state , but it is still difficult to calculate reliable excited state energies within dmc . an alternative approach is to use a repulsive top - hat potential  @xcite whose ground state resembles the first excited state of the contact potential . </S>",
    "<S> however , this potential has a finite range greater than the scattering length , resulting in an incorrect scattering phase shift .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty in simulating repulsive interactions means that there are important open questions about fermionic gases : is the ground state of a strongly interacting fermionic system ferromagnetic  @xcite ; is the ferromagnetic transition first or second order ; and whether exotic phases emerge around quantum criticality such as spin spirals  @xcite , nematic phases  @xcite , and a counterintuitive @xmath4-wave superconducting state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the development of a pseudopotential that is better able to reproduce the scattering properties of the contact interaction will help resolve these open questions .    </S>",
    "<S> in section i , we present two pseudopotentials for the interatomic interaction in a cold atom gas . </S>",
    "<S> we first adapt norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite , developed by the electronic structure community for electron - ion interactions , to deal effectively with scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> we then present a new pseudopotential constructed to minimize the scattering phase shift error for all wavevectors in a fermi gas . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we test the accuracy of the new formalism using the exactly soluble system of two trapped atoms . in section iii , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the pseudopotential performs in a many - body setting by calculating the equation of state of the weakly repulsive fermi gas and comparing results to a perturbation expansion . </S>"
