    "most recently , solar flare observations using the _ solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation _ ( sumer ) instrument onboard the _ solar & heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) have identified many coronal forbidden lines in the wavelength range from 500 - 1600    @xcite . by comparison ,",

    "they include the targets of the _ fuse _ team s cool star survey , supplemented with a number of guest observer observations .",
    "table  [ summary ] summarizes the _ fuse _ observations .",
    "most targets were observed in time - tagged mode , and all were observed either through the medium resolution slit ( mdrs , @xmath13 ) or the large aperture ( lwrs , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the lwrs has the advantage of usually including light from all of the lif and sic channels for the duration of the exposure , at the expense of higher airglow contamination , especially at ly@xmath12 and ly@xmath15 , but also in many and lines .",
    "the mdrs reduces airglow , but thermal effects often cause one or more of the channels to drift out of the aperture during an exposure , because only the lif1 channel is used for guiding .",
    "we monitor the integrated flux of the strongest lines in each segment ( i.e. @xmath0977 , @xmath01031 , and @xmath01176 ) . during exposures",
    "when the star drifts our of the aperture , the flux in these lines is significantly reduced from its nominal value .",
    "these exposures are therefore not included in the reduction of the final spectrum .",
    "the spectral images were processed with calfuse 2.0.5 .",
    "compared to earlier versions of the pipeline , this new rendition provides a more accurate wavelength scale , removes large noise event bursts , corrects for misplaced photons at low sensitivity portions of the detector ( so - called `` walk '' problem ) , improves corrections for scattered light and astigmatism , extracts the spectrum using an `` optimal '' algorithm , and applies a more accurate flux calibration ( flux errors are @xmath1615% ; oegerle , murphy , & kriss [ 2000 ] ) .",
    "although the scattered light correction and flux calibration are much improved , they remain approximations and can occasionally lead to negative flux levels , where there is no stellar emission .",
    "the flux error incorporates the errors involved in these calibration steps .",
    "individual exposures were reduced separately and the integrated flux in strong emission lines was used to test the consistency of the signal recorded in each segment , throughout the entire observation . for each segment ,",
    "the exposures then were cross - correlated , using selected stellar emission features , and coadded , excepting those with significant drops in signal due to target drifts out of the aperture ( a common occurrence for mdrs observations ) .",
    "redundant segments were not coadded , however , to avoid degrading the spectral resolution .",
    "the correction for astigmatism ( curvature of spectrum perpendicular to the dispersion ) improves the spectral resolution by 510% compared with earlier versions of calfuse used to reduce the previously published spectra of ab  dor @xcite and capella @xcite .",
    "the relative wavelength scale within a given detector channel is accurate to @xmath17  5  over most of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) bandpass , except for some deterioration at the far edges of the individual channels @xcite . due to the absence of an onboard wavelength calibration lamp , we established the zero point of the wavelength scale according to interstellar absorption features in the 1036.34    and 977.02    lines , and by comparing the 1176    lines in _ fuse _ spectra with wavelength - calibrated observations by _",
    "hst_. the procedure is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we searched for evidence of coronal forbidden lines in the 900 - 1200    region in our sample of stellar spectra . due to our relatively poor knowledge of the rest wavelengths of these lines , the relatively weak signal of the coronal lines , and the moderate likelihood of coincidental blends with low temperature lines ,",
    "labeling spectral features located at wavelengths coincident with an expected coronal line can lead to misidentifications , as demonstrated below .",
    "therefore , we used a comparative technique developed by @xcite to identify coronal forbidden lines in longer wavelength _ hst _ spectra .",
    "we compared each sample spectrum with a typical spectrum of an active and inactive dwarf star ( au  mic and @xmath3  cen  a , respectively ) , and an active and inactive giant star ( @xmath12  cet and @xmath12  gem , respectively ) .",
    "strong coronal emission lines will stand out as broad features in the spectra of active stars , but should be absent in the inactive stars .",
    "coincidental low temperature lines in the active spectra can be identified because they will be relatively narrow , and also be present in the inactive stars .",
    "the underlying assumptions in this comparative analysis are that active stars have larger coronal emission measures than inactive stars , and that giant stars all have reasonably similar emission measure distributions , and all dwarf stars also share similar emission measure distributions .",
    "although we have chosen specific active stars to demonstrate this technique below , any star with its own unique emission measure distribution can be used as the standard .",
    "this comparison proves useful at identifying coincident blends and should be used along with other line identification techniques when searching for coronal forbidden lines .",
    "figure  [ lines ] illustrates the comparative technique .",
    "we selected the four strongest high temperature ( @xmath18  k ) coronal forbidden lines observed in solar flares @xcite and located in the _ fuse _ spectral range : @xmath0974 ( @xmath19  k ) , @xmath01118 ( @xmath20  k ) , @xmath01133 ( @xmath21  k ) , and @xmath01153 ( @xmath22  k ) .",
    "as the strongest lines in the _ fuse _ spectral range detected in solar flares , these lines are an appropriate place to start looking for coronal forbidden lines in stellar spectra .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ lines ] demonstrate that and are positively detected , because the features appear in the normalized spectra of both active stars , and are absent in the inactive stars .",
    ", shown in the bottom panel is clearly not detected in any of the stars . at the expected location of , there is a prominent feature .",
    "however , it is present only in the spectra of the giant stars , both active and inactive , and is narrow , inconsistent with the high line formation temperature . therefore , it has the characteristics of a low temperature line .",
    "in fact , @xcite identified numerous fluorescent lines in the _ fuse _ spectra of @xmath3  tra , two of which fall at wavelengths 1133.675    and 1133.854   .",
    "these lines are blended and appear as a single feature .",
    "therefore , the emission detected in _ fuse _ spectra at @xmath23    is not , but rather a coincidental fluorescent line pumped by h  ly@xmath3 .",
    "the comparative technique was applied to an extensive list of more than 50 candidate coronal forbidden lines that lie in the _ fuse _ spectral range . of these ,",
    "only two were positively detected : the @xmath0974 and @xmath01118 lines mentioned previously .",
    "these features form at @xmath1 and @xmath24 , respectively . in table",
    "[ observed ] , we list the observed integrated line strengths corresponding to direct flux integrations within @xmath17  150  km  s@xmath9 of line center for stars with @xmath25  km  s@xmath9 , and within @xmath17  250  km  s@xmath9 for stars with @xmath26  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "x - ray fluxes , also included in the table , are based on the 0.2 - 2.0  kev band observed by the _ rntgensatellit _ ( _ rosat _ ) .",
    "the addition of the @xmath0974 line , in particular , to the collection of uv coronal forbidden lines is very promising , due to its optimum spectral context . unlike other high temperature forbidden lines , such as @xmath01118 and @xmath01354 whose",
    "profiles are compromised by coincident blends , the nearest significant blend with is @xmath27  km  s@xmath9 from line center .",
    "therefore , requires no additional assumptions or delicate deconvolutions , when trying to reconstruct the intrinsic coronal forbidden line profile .",
    "furthermore , the ultraviolet continua of typical cool stars decrease dramatically toward the shorter wavelengths .",
    "therefore , modeling the continuum , if present at all , is less challenging in the spectral region around , than , for example , at @xmath01354 . also , the strong local interstellar medium ( lism ) absorption in the prominent 977.02    line , adjacent to the line , provides a convenient means of calibrating the zero point of the local velocity scale .",
    "figure  [ fe18line ] presents the @xmath0974 lines , and single gaussian fits , in seven spectra of the slowly rotating stars with detections . table  [ fits ] lists the derived parameters . in figure",
    "[ fe18line ] , the solid horizontal line indicates the continuum level ( often zero ) , based on line - free regions on either side of the feature . the intrinsic stellar line profile ( prior to convolution with the instrumental line spread function [ wood et al .",
    "2002 ] and the rotational line profile ) is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the solid curve represents the predicted profile including both instrumental and rotational broadening .",
    "note that the intrinsic line widths are so broad that the contribution of the instrument and rotation often is negligible .",
    "rotational broadening is most noticeable for 47  cas , which is the only star among these seven with @xmath28  km  s@xmath9 ; the other six stars have relatively modest rotational velocities ( see table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fe18line ] indicates very little variation in line width among the seven targets , consistent with domination by thermal broadening .",

    "a reasonable range is @xmath30 , which corresponds to widths of @xmath31  km  s  @xmath32 . in column  7 of table",
    "[ fits ] , we list the equivalent temperature required to account for the observed intrinsic line width if turbulent motions do not contribute to the line broadening .",
    "figure  [ fe18line ] also demonstrates that @xmath0974 displays no large velocity shifts , as the emission centroids are approximately at the rest velocity of the stellar photosphere in all cases . in a couple of the stars , 47  cas and ek  dra , we were unable to determine an accurate zero point of the wavelength scale because either there is no obvious lism absorption in the 977.02    line , or no high - resolution wavelength - calibrated data ( e.g. , stis ) available to measure the velocity of lism absorption empirically . therefore , for these two stars , we assume that the centroid of the feature is at the rest velocity of the star .",
    "@xcite showed that the centroid of can be shifted from line center by as much as 15  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "therefore we use 15  km  s@xmath9 as our estimate of the systematic error . only in the two broadest profiles , 31  com and ab  dor ,",
    "do the statistical errors dominate the systematic errors .",
    "spreading out the signal of an already weak coronal line , makes it extremely difficult to accurately determine the centroid of the feature .",
    "higher s / n observations are required for the stars that exhibit broad line profiles in order to measure the centroids of the emission .",
    "the widths in most of the stars are consistent with little to no turbulent broadening : thermal broadening , alone , is sufficient to account for the observed intrinsic line width .",
    "the two fastest rotating stars in the sample , 31  com and ab  dor show large intrinsic line widths , however , even when the photospheric rotational broadening is taken into account .",
    "another fast rotator , 47  cas , also shows a large line width , marginally in excess of the expected thermal broadening .",
    "although an additional broadening mechanism may also play a part in the coronal line profiles of 47  cas , we limit the following analysis to 31  com and ab  dor .",
    "the spectra of these two stars clearly indicates that thermal broadening alone is insufficient to account for the width of the coronal line profiles . in figure",
    "[ fe18rot ] , the top panels show the initial single gaussian fit for which the rotational broadening was fixed at the observed photospheric value .",
    "it is clear that the inferred intrinsic line profile is much wider than those of the slow rotators , shown in figure  [ fe18line ] .",
    "it seems unlikely that nonthermal , turbulent broadening in 31  com and ab  dor could explain the very broad profiles , because such broadening is clearly of little importance in the other stars .",
    "instead , we interpret the additional broadening to be the result of `` super - rotation '' , extended co - rotating coronal emission high above the stellar photosphere . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fe18rot ] ,",
    "the intrinsic line width was fixed at the thermal value .",
    "an alternative broadening mechanism is now required to derive a satisfactory fit to the data .",
    "if we allow the rotational velocity to vary , the additional broadening can now be attributed to a value of @xmath4 that is larger than the photospheric value .",
    "both models produce equally satisfactory fits , but the top panels indicate a model that assumes that the rotational velocity is fixed at the photospheric value and turbulent broadening must account for the line width , whereas the bottom panels assume that turbulent broadening is negligible , based on the results of the slowly rotating stars , and the rotational velocity is instead the free parameter . for 31  com , @xmath33 for the fixed rotational velocity model and @xmath34 for the variable rotational velocity model . for ab  dor , @xmath35 for the fixed rotational velocity model and @xmath36 for the variable rotational velocity model .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n of the data is not high enough to differentiate between the two assumptions based solely on the subtle differences in the resulting line profile .",
    "however , the unanimous result that turbulent broadening is nonexistent in our sample of slowly rotating stars , leads us to propose that the additional broadening is due to the rotation of the coronal material at velocities greater than the photospheric @xmath4 .",
    "the best fit @xmath4 for 31  com is @xmath37 km  s@xmath9 and for ab  dor , @xmath38 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "although the s / n of the data prohibits an accurate determination of the coronal rotational velocity , it is clear that it must be greater than the photospheric value .",
    "based on the enhanced rotational velocities , we can estimate how far above the stellar surface the presumably co - rotating emitting plasma extends . for 31  com , we infer that coronal material extends to @xmath5r  @xmath39  r@xmath7 above the stellar surface , and for ab  dor , @xmath5r  @xmath40  r@xmath7 .",
    "similar calculations have been made using transition region lines @xcite and coronal forbidden lines @xcite , observed with _ hst_. extended , but cooler , structures also have been inferred through time series of h@xmath3 absorption spectra of ab  dor @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used zeeman - doppler maps of ab  dor to extrapolate the topology of the extended coronal magnetic field .    an alternative interpretation to explain the observed additional broadening is by the presence of high speed flows .",
    "measurements of density sensitive lines in spectra observed by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ satellite ( _ euve _ ) , seem to indicate that the emitting volume of the coronal plasma is small compared to the stellar radius @xcite .",
    "this appears to imply compact coronal structures as opposed to extended co - rotating coronal emission .",
    "such high speed flows in coronal plasmas have recently been observed on the sun @xcite .",
    "however , we only detect additional broadening in the fastest rotating stars , not necessarily in the most active . for example",
    ", slow rotators , such as @xmath11  eri and au  mic , which are much more active than the sun , do not exhibit additional broadening , although they may be expected to have prominent high speed flows .",
    "therefore , we feel that emission from plasma confined in extended but thin magnetic loops is a more likely explanation for the observed additional broadening in the fastest rotators , although a specific model should be built with densities consistent with the euve measurements to support this conclusion .",
    "to estimate whether plasma confined in extended magnetic flux tubes can explain the observed broad fe  xviii emission lines , we consider this simple example .",
    "we assume that all of the fe  xviii emission occurs in half - circular flux loops extending up to a height @xmath41 above the stellar surface with a constant radius @xmath42 and electron density @xmath43 .",
    "if there are @xmath44 such loops , then the emission measure @xmath45 .",
    "we can now solve for the product ,    @xmath46    as an example , we consider the corona of ab  dor . @xcite analyzed the nonflare spectrum of ab  dor observed by the rgs instrument on xmm . in their three component model",
    ", the middle temperature component has a temperature @xmath47 kev , similar to the formation temperture of fe  xviii , and the corresponding emission measure @xmath48 @xmath49",
    ". ratios of the helium - like triplet lines of o  vii are consistent with a coronal electron density @xmath50 @xmath49 . if `` super - rotation '' is the explanation for the widths of the fe  xviii line , then @xmath51 cm for @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "these parameters yield @xmath53 . if we assume",
    "n = 10 or 100 , then @xmath3 = 0.03 or 0.009 , and the loops are thin as is true for the solar corona @xcite . we conclude that the `` super - rotation '' model with many thin flux loops is consistent with the coronal data for this test case .",
    "also the flux loop thickness parameter @xmath3 will likely be small , as expected , for a wide range of coronal parameters .",
    "interpretation of the coronal @xmath0974 feature of the giant binary capella is complicated by the fact that both stars ( the g8 giant primary [ @xmath3 aur aa ] and the g1 giant secondary [ @xmath3 aur ab ] ) can contribute to the emission .",
    "_ hst _ observations of the @xmath01354 line profile of capella have demonstrated that the relative contribution by each star changes with time .",
    "based on the analysis of capella observations taken on 1995 september 9 , @xcite determined that each star provided approximately half of the total emission flux . @xcite and @xcite showed in stis observations of capella taken four years later , on 1999 september 12 , that the emission from the g8 primary star was reduced to @xmath54% of its previous level , although the g1 component remained about the same .",
    "@xcite used a single gaussian model and applied it to the first _ fuse _ observation of capella ( 2000 nov 5 ) to evaluate the individual stellar contributions to the emission flux .",
    "they estimated that the g8 primary contributed @xmath55% of the total flux .",
    "we go beyond that first stage analysis by fitting all three available _ fuse _ observations in an effort to better understand the nature of capella s coronal feature .",
    "the dates of the capella observations are listed in table  [ summary ] , while individual stellar velocities , phases , and the ephemeris reference are listed in table  [ properties ] .",

    "figure  [ fe18cap ] illustrates the fit to each individual exposure .",
    "the first two observations were taken near orbital quadrature ( maximum radial velocity separation ) , and the third near conjunction ( minimum velocity separation ) .",
    "the velocity scale was adjusted to the reference frame of the g8 primary star , known to @xmath56  km  s@xmath9 , using the strong lism absorption in the neighboring 977.02    line @xcite .",
    "the fit parameters corresponding to figure  [ fe18cap ] are listed in table  [ fitscapella ] .",
    "it is unclear why there is a decrease in integrated flux between the first and second two observations .",
    "instrumental effects , such as thermal drifts , can cause a decrease in flux , as discussed in section  2 .",
    "although stellar variability may also explain the decrease in flux @xcite , it is unlikely because the first two discrepant observations were are taken only two days apart .",
    "however , the flux discrepancy does not effect the line width , line centroid , or flux ratio of the binary components , and therefore does not effect the conclusions of this work .",
    "the bulk of the emission clearly is associated with the g8 star , based on the centroid of the emission , as was noted by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the line width decreases significantly between quadrature and conjunction .",
    "this indicates that although emission from the g8 primary star may dominate , there is a nonnegligible contribution from the faster rotating g1 star , and we are compelled to fit the capella emission feature with two components , one for the contribution of each star .    in order to estimate the contribution of the g1 secondary star",
    ", we modeled the @xmath0974 emission profile with two gaussians , one for each star , including instrumental and rotational broadening as before . in this case , however , the rotational velocity of the g8 star is small ( @xmath57 km  s@xmath9 ) , but that of the g1 star is much larger ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath9 ; strassmeier et al .",
    "[ 1988 ] ) .",
    "although there is discernible emission from the g1 secondary star , it is still relatively weak , and the gaussian modeling benefits from fixing several of the free parameters . in particular , we constrained the velocity centroid of each component to be at the respective orbital velocity , and the fwhm of the g8 component to the value determined from the single gaussian fit near conjunction ( essentially the thermal width ) .",
    "both constraints are motivated by the empirical behavior of active single stars , discussed in section  [ secfe18 ] : velocity centroids are consistent with the photospheric radial velocities ; and line widths in slow rotators are well characterized by thermal broadening alone .",

    "in contrast to @xmath0974 , there are several severe blends that can obscure the feature .",
    "at least eight lines are scattered between 1117.20    and 1118.49   . in some stars , however , these lines are weak relative to the coronal emission . the interval surrounding is shown in figure  [ fe19line ] for the 10 stars that exhibit a significant feature . if we assume that the emission measure is the same for the formation of and , we can predict the line profile of based on theoretical emissivities and the empirical gaussian parameters . we compute the emissivities with chianti version 4 @xcite .",

    "the coronal fluxes are normalized by the bolometric fluxes given in table  [ properties ] , to remove biases of stellar size and distance .",
    "those stars with detected emission are displayed as open circles , and those with upper limits are shown as small filled circles .",
    "a unit slope power law is indicated by the thick dashed line .",
    "a good correlation exists over two orders of magnitude , down to a sensitivity threshold of @xmath63 .",
    "all of the upper limits are consistent with this correlation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a similar unit power law correlation for @xmath01354 . in active stars , at least , the flux can serve as a surrogate for the broad - band soft x - ray emission .",
    "_ fuse _ provides an opportunity to study a new collection of high temperature ( @xmath64 k ) forbidden lines in nearby coronal stars .",
    "the goal of the present paper was to extensively examine _ fuse _ observations of late - type stars for such features , and to analyze any detections as potential diagnostics of the physical characteristics of the high temperature plasmas .",
    "our results are as follows :    * after searching the _ fuse _ spectra for candidate coronal forbidden lines identified in solar flares @xcite , only two were found : @xmath0974 and @xmath01118 .",
    "detections were obtained in 10 of the 26 stars in our sample . the two _ fuse _ lines join @xmath101242,1349 and @xmath01354 coronal lines from the stis 1200 - 1600    region .",
    "* of the five known ultraviolet coronal forbidden lines , @xmath0974 has important advantages as a spectroscopic diagnostic . unlike @xmath01354 and @xmath01118 ,",
    "is not blended with low temperature lines that can corrupt the intrinsic line profile .",
    "likewise , the stellar continuum is almost nonexistent at the location of , whereas , at longer wavelengths it can create difficulties for isolating the weak coronal forbidden emission .",
    "although _ fuse _ does not have an internal wavelength calibration system , lism absorption in the strong 977.02    line , just 660  km  s@xmath9 redward of , often can be used as a wavelength fiducial ( in those cases where @xmath65 is known independently ) .",
    "* we find that a single gaussian component is successful for modeling the @xmath0974 profile for all single stars .",
    "the line is fully resolved , so instrumental broadening is negligible . *",
    "the centroid of @xmath0974 is approximately at rest relative to the radial velocity of the star , in contrast to lower temperature ( @xmath66  k ) transition region lines which are often redshifted 10 - 15  km  s  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high temperature plasma likely is confined in stable magnetic structures ; not participating in any large systematic mass motions . * for all of the slowly rotating stars , thermal broadening dominates the widths of the coronal forbidden lines , consistent with predicted formation temperatures @xmath67  k. turbulent broadening appears to be negligible , which is additional evidence that the hot coronal material might be stably entrained in coronal magnetic structures in slowly rotating stars . *",
    "three of the fastest rotating stars in our sample ( ab  dor , 31  com , and the g1 star of capella ) , all show excess broadening in @xmath0974 . owing to the overwhelming similarity of line widths in all of the slowly rotating stars of our sample ,",
    "we attribute the excess to `` super - rotational '' broadening .",
    "namely , the hot gas is co - rotating in extended coronal structures rising well above the stellar surface .",
    "we estimate that this material is located approximately @xmath5r  @xmath68-@xmath69r@xmath7 beyond the stellar photosphere .",
    "high speed flows could also potentially explain the excess broadening , although it is not clear why such flows would be observed in the fastest rotating stars . a detailed discussion concerning the cause of the excess broadening is given in section  [ secfe18 ] . * the @xmath0974 profile of capella is complicated by contributions from both stars of the binary .",
    "as demonstrated with the @xmath01354 line , the relative contribution of each star can vary @xcite .",
    "using three different observations , at quadrature and conjunction , we find that the g8 primary contributes @xmath70% of the emission , and the g1 secondary @xmath60% . *",
    "we find an excellent correlation between @xmath0974 and the 0.2 - 2.0  kev _ rosat _ soft x - ray flux .",
    "although upper limits mask any trends at lower activity levels , we expect that the correlation will exhibit a `` break '' at a critical activity level where the flux will drop faster than the unit slope power law for stars of progressively lower activity .",
    "in particular , @xcite have demonstrated that the coronal temperature drops with decreasing activity , and eventually the coronal emission measures will peak below the formation temperature , suppressing the forbidden line flux relative to the soft x - ray band .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission , which is operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "financial support to u. s. participants has been provided by nasa contract nas5 - 32985 , as well as individual _ fuse _ guest investigator grants .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and the _ rosat _ x - ray archive at the heasarc of the nasa goddard space flight center .",
