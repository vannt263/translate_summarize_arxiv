    "the broad aim of this project is to investigate disk galaxy evolution , as a function of both redshift and environment , using rotation velocity as a baseline for the comparison of various galaxy properties . to achieve this",
    "we have obtained vlt / fors2 multi - slit spectroscopy for a large number of bright emission - line galaxies in the fields of six clusters with redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "rotation velocities were measured by fitting the [ oii ] emission line using a synthetic rotation curve method called elfit2py , which is based on the algorithms of elfit2d by simard & pritchet ( 1999 ) .",
    "the results of these fits have been thoroughly examined to determine their quality , and to reject measurements which are deemed unreliable .",
    "photometry and structural parameters are measured on imaging from a range of sources , primarily fors2 and hst .",
    "full details of the sample selection and data analysis are given in bamford et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and milvang - jensen et al .",
    "our final sample consists of 111 emission - line galaxies with secure rotation velocity measurements , and covers the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "there is now much evidence indicating a transformation of star - forming spirals into passive s0 galaxies in cluster environments .",
    "however , the detailed form of this evolution and the mechanisms responsible are still far from certain .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the interaction causes an enhancement of the star - formation rate prior to its eventual truncation . to examine this question ,",
    "we have compared the b - band tully - fisher ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) relation ( tfr ) for ` matched ' samples of field and cluster spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "1 shows our tfr for 58 field and 22 cluster galaxies covering similar ranges in redshift ( @xmath7 ) and luminosity ( @xmath8 mag ) .",
    "the cluster galaxies show an offset from the field sample , such that they are @xmath9 mag brighter for a given rotation velocity .",
    "2 presents this in terms of residuals from the local fiducial relation of pierce & tully ( 1992 ; hereafter pt92 ) , versus redshift .",
    "the offset persists , at a @xmath10 significance level , even when evolution in the field sample is accounted for , as shown by fig .  3 .",
    "this result implies a phase of enhanced luminosity ( and hence star - formation ) in the early stages of a spiral s interaction with the cluster environment .",
    "studies examining the evolution of the global star formation rate ( sfr ) density of the universe find a substantial increase of a factor of @xmath11 from @xmath12@xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "is this trend simply due to an evolution in the star - formation rates of individual giant spirals , or is some other process or population responsible ?",
    "does the evolution depend on galaxy mass ?",
    "to investigate this we have again used the tfr , to look for changes in the relation between @xmath14 ( a proxy for sfr ) and @xmath15 ( a proxy for total mass ) , as described fully in bamford et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .    our tfr for 89 field spirals with @xmath16",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the slope is not significantly different to that measured locally , i.e. , no evidence for mass - dependent evolution . examining the tfr residuals versus @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , or fitting the tfr intercept in several redshift bins ( fig .  5 ) , we find a @xmath18-band brightening of @xmath1 mag , for a given @xmath15 , by @xmath19 .",
    "due to selection effects this is an upper limit to the true evolution , but still implies slower sfr evolution than measured globally .",
    "this suggests that the global sfr evolution of the universe is _ not _ driven by the sfr decline in giant spirals .",
    "the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) is a study of galaxies in and around @xmath20 clusters at @xmath21 .",
    "these clusters were optically selected using the las campanas distant cluster survey ( @xcite ) , and thus have a wide range of properties .",
    "for each cluster we have a wealth of imaging and spectroscopy data .",
    "many projects are underway using these data , including studies of morphology , luminosity functions , colour - magnitude diagrams , cluster substructure , velocity distributions , lensing masses and stellar populations .    from the spectra we are now measuring reliable rotation velocities , in order to perform detailed investigations into the evolution of various galaxy properties with respect to this useful baseline . with more than 5 times as many galaxies",
    ", we will have the statistical power to vastly improve upon the studies shown above .",
    "the addition of hst morphologies , homogeneous colours , spectral indices and a variety of clusters with well characterised properties , will allow unprecedented studies of disk galaxy evolution with environment and redshift .    1 , s.p .",
