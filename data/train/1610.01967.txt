    "back in 1968 , ashcroft predicted that according to the bcs theory@xcite , dense hydrogen would not only be metallic@xcite , but more importantly also a high - temperature superconductor@xcite .",
    "since recently it has been shown that dissociation is a necessary condition for the metallization of hydrogen@xcite , the necessary pressure to cause bandgap closure has remained impractical high , so that metallic hydrogen has only been realized at finite - temperature@xcite . yet , an appealing way to circumvent the high pressures required to metallize",
    "hydrogen is to precompress it in hydrogen - rich systems@xcite , since , in general , the electronic density of states is high and the electron - phonon interactions are strong@xcite .",
    "in fact , pressurized hydrogen - rich materials have demonstrated to be rather promising candidates for high - t@xmath3 superconductivity @xcite . in particular , drozdov and eremets",
    "reported that at pressures around 200  gpa , dense hydrogen sulphide becomes metallic and superconducting with a critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) of 203  k@xcite , which is well above the highest t@xmath3 of 133  k and 164  k that were achieved in cuprates@xcite at ambient@xcite and high pressures@xcite respectively .",
    "recent experimental results indicate that the superconducting state of h@xmath2s adopts a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure@xcite .",
    "however , nearly all of the recent calculations on hydrogen - rich systems are based on the single - particle mean - field theories such as density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite . even though formally exact , the exact exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional is unknown from the outset and needs to be approximated , which affects both the relative stabilities of the different crystal structures .",
    "indeed , for dense hydrogen - rich materials a significant dependence on the particular of xc functional was established @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we revisit the stability of the individual products originating from the various proposed decompositions of h@xmath0s for pressures above 150  gpa by means of highly accurate diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) simulations . using the dmc method@xcite ,",
    "the electronic many - body schrdinger equation is solved stochastically , which have yielded very accurate total energies for atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , crystals@xcite including hydrogen - rich materials at very high pressure@xcite .",
    "at first , all of the examined structures were determined by relaxing the internal parameters of each phase within dft at fixed external pressure .",
    "the dft calculations were all conducted within the pseudopotential and plane - wave approach using the castep code@xcite . specifically , ultrasoft pseudopotentials were employed together with an energy cutoff of 1000  ev@xcite .",
    "the exact xc functional was substituted by the generalized gradient approximation of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite the geometry and cell optimizations were conducted using a dense @xmath5 @xmath6-point mesh to sample the brillouin zone , while the nuclear forces and components of the stress tensor were converged to 0.01  ev/@xmath7 and 0.01  gpa , respectively .",

    "the resulting plane - wave orbitals were subsequently transformed into a localized `` blip''polynomial basis@xcite .    the jastrow factor within eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is a positive , symmetric , explicit function of interparticle distances .",
    "the employed jastrow factor includes polynomial one - body electron - nucleus ( 1b ) , two - body electron - electron ( 2b ) and three - body electron - electron - nucleus ( 3b ) terms , as well as plane - wave expansions of the electron - electron separation known as @xmath19 terms@xcite .",
    "these @xmath19 terms build long - ranged correlations into the jastrow factor and thus significantly improve the wave function and variational energy .",
    "we also investigated the effect of the inhomogenous backflow ( bf ) coordinate transformation on the vmc and dmc total energies@xcite .",
    "our bf transformation includes electron - electron and electron - proton terms and is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transformed coordinate of electron @xmath13 , which depends on the full configuration of the system @xmath22 .",
    "the vector functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the electron - electron and electron - proton backflow displacements of electron @xmath13 .",
    "they are parameterized as @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are polynomial functions of electron - electron and electron - proton distances that contains variational parameters .",
    "all adjustable parameters in the jastrow factor and backflow terms were optimized by minimizing the variance as well as the variational energy at the vmc level@xcite .",
    "if not explictly stated otherwise , all of our calculations were conducted using the sj trail wave function including 1b , 2b , 3b and p terms augmented by the bf coordinate transformation .    beside the usage of twist - averaged boundary conditions ( tabc ) to correct finite - size errors@xcite , we extrapolated the energy per atom to the thermodynamic limit by fitting our twist - averaged dmc results for different system sizes to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are fitting parameters and @xmath32 is the eventual energy per atom in the infinite - system limit . depending on simulation cell size , we used 8 , 12 and 16 randomly chosen twists@xcite .",

    "it is apparent that the addition of the three - body term and more so the @xmath19 term substantially reduces the vmc energy , but tht the dmc is only marginally affected since the initial nodal structure is identical .",
    "the usage of the bf transformation , however , improves the nodal surface and hence entails an energy lowering at the vmc and the dmc levels .",
    "interestingly , the gain in energy for hs@xmath0 is much more pronounced than for h@xmath2s , which demonstrates the importance of an accurate trail wave function for the former . for the im-3 m phase of h@xmath2s the energy gain is -1.634 and -0.56  ev at the vmc and dmc levels of theory , while for the c2/m hs@xmath0 structure , the energy gain can be as high as -4.898 and -1.643  ev .

    "even though it is partially compensated by the fact that the less complex bsj(1b+2b ) trail wave function is equally accurate than the much more complex sj(1b+2b+3b+@xmath19 ) calculations , we have elected to use the former instead of the latter in the following dmc calculations of the enthalpy - pressure phase diagram calculations .      in order to compute the enthalpy - pressure phase diagrams for the different structures",

    "it is straightforward to calculate the pressure @xmath39 as a function of @xmath37 and thus also the enthalpy per atom @xmath40 .",
    "in previous dft calculations including zpe correction it was predicted that at 200  gpa 5h@xmath0s decomposes into 3h@xmath2s and hs@xmath0 , where hs@xmath0 adopts c2/c symmetry , but undergoes a phase transition to the more stable c2/m structure at 250  gpa@xcite .",

    "the present dmc enthalpy - pressure curves of hs are shown in fig .",
    "[ hphs ] . at variance to dft",
    ", they suggest that the c2/m phase of hs is more stable than the i4@xmath1/amd hs structure over the whole pressure range from 150 to 400  gpa .",
    "in fact , the difference in enthalpy between the c2/m and i4@xmath1/amd phases is more than 600 mev / atom and is even larger with increasing pressure .",

    ", our dmc enthalpy - pressure calculations again show that the im-3 m h@xmath2s structure is the more favorable candidate up to at least 320  gpa , which is in agreement with very recent experimental results.@xcite    this is to say that altogether , our dmc results leads to a revision of the enthalpy - pressure phase diagram between 150 and 320  gpa .",
    "specifically , we find that the c2/c hs@xmath0 , c2/m hs and im-3 m h@xmath2s structures are energetically most favorable within the considered pressure range .",
    "however , it is well - known that the zpe corrections plays an important role in the numerical determination of the phase diagram hydrogen - rich systems@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , dft calculations of others have shown that the energy difference between h@xmath0s and s+h@xmath0 due to zpe is about 6 mev / f.u . at 160  gpa@xcite , which is much smaller than our dmc enthalpy differences .",
    "we thus predict that the effect of zpe on our dmc results is negligible .",
    "in summary , using highly accurate dmc calculations , we find that in the pressure range between 150 and 320  gpa , the c2/c hs@xmath0 , c2/m hs and the superconducting im-3 m h@xmath2s structures are the enthalpically most favorable products of the decomposition of h@xmath0s .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude by noting that instead of the often proposed decomposition of h@xmath0s into h@xmath2s , hs@xmath0 , hs , or rather elemental @xmath41 , the dissociation into h@xmath2s@xmath42 and hs@xmath43 would be chemically much more sensible and still compatible with the recently performed xrd measurements@xcite .",
