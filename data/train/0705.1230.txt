    "interfacial phenomena have been a matter of great research interest for centuries @xcite . with the growing importance of nanotechnology",
    ", however , this field of research is expected to become even more relevant .",
    "as the surface to volume ratios diminish in miniaturized devices , surface effects become increasingly important and strongly influence the state of the systems @xcite , including new and surprising behavior @xcite .    whereas the structure of the interface can be quite complex at the microscopic level @xcite , from a thermodynamic point of view only the interfacial tensions are really required to describe the system s behavior in most instances ( e.g. , young s equation ) .",
    "statistical mechanics provides a link for the calculation of interface tensions in terms of the average of a mechanical property , namely , the anisotropy of the pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "this route has been applied to estimate interface tensions , either theoretically @xcite , or by means of computer simulations @xcite .",
    "results are known for some prototype systems , including the lennard ",
    "jones @xcite , square well @xcite and gay  berne @xcite fluids , as well as bead ",
    "spring polymer chains @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit evaluation of the pressure tensor is already a very subtle matter for simple fluids @xcite .",
    "the presence of discontinuities in the potential , either inherent in the model or resulting from truncation in computer simulations can cause difficulties @xcite , and at any rate need the approximate evaluation of dirac _ delta _ functions . for molecular fluids the difficulties may become even more important",
    ", since the bonding is often rigid and the resulting contribution of the constraining forces becomes difficult to estimate @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature to overcome the difficulties related to explicit evaluation of the virial . a useful methodology which is particularly interesting in the vicinity of the critical point was proposed long time ago by binder @xcite , and",
    "has received renewed interest recently @xcite .",
    "although cast in terms of probability distributions , this method is equivalent to a full thermodynamic integration from the one phase state to a two phase state @xcite . in that sense , it can be considered as an extension of thermodynamic integration employed to calculate interfacial tensions from adsorption isotherms @xcite .",
    "the need for sampling all states between the homogeneous bulk phase and the phase coexisting states ( slab geometry ) makes it fairly time consuming away from the critical point . on the other hand",
    ", one gets a large amount of information on the intermediate metastable states which can be exploited for use in nucleation studies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can explicitely simulate two phase states only and attempt to collect averages containing information on the interface .",
    "one such method is based on the capillary hamiltonian approximation , whereby the spectra of interfacial capillary waves is analyzed , and the surface tension is obtained from the long wavelength behavior @xcite .",
    "this method may be applied only for the liquid  vapor interface and presents difficulties related to the explicit location of the interface boundary , but does not seem to be affected by this arbitrariness at long wavelengths @xcite . a third route that allows to calculate interfacial tensions without explicit evaluation of the virial",
    "is based on the perturbation of the two phase system , by increasing or decreasing the interface a finite amount . for curved interfaces ,",
    "this method resembles the philosophy of scaled particle theory @xcite , and was exploited by bresme and quirke in order to calculate the interfacial tension of colloidal nano particulates @xcite .",
    "another perturbative approach , the test area method of gloor et al .",
    ", has been recently applied to the study of flat interfaces , providing reliable estimates for spherical and anisotropic fluids @xcite .",
    "these methods are special cases of a more general methodology which can be applied to measure first derivatives of the free energy @xcite , with the widom test particle method as the most widely known application @xcite . in the perturbative methods ,",
    "the difficulty is the choice of surface increment , and the reliable average of the resulting small energy change , as is the case in the evaluation of numerical derivatives . in this work",
    "we propose a new method which has features of both the binder method , in the sense that it relies on histogram analysis , and the perturbative approaches employed by bresme and quirke and gloor et al .",
    ", in the sense that the system is subject to small perturbations of the surface area .",
    "the difference is that the perturbations add up and the interface is allowed to wander freely .",
    "an analysis of the resulting probability distribution , or , alternatively , the corresponding average , yields the required interface tensions .",
    "another route for calculating the interfacial tension is the density functional theory . in this approach",
    "the grand potential of the system is a functional of the local density , therefore the interfacial tension is readily accessible once the functional is minimized .",
    "several density functionals and related self consistent field theories for polymeric fluids have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "one class of functionals is based on the polymer reference interaction site model .",
    "@xcite another class is based on the woodward formalism @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the functional belonging to the latter class and proposed by yu and wu @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on wertheim s first - order thermodynamic perturbations theory@xcite ( tpt1 ) , and is one of the most accurate functionals for tangent hard sphere systems .",
    "however , besides the comparison with our new simulation methodology our choice of the functional serves another purpose .",
    "the yu and wu theory is also used as a starting point for derivation of an analytical approximation for the interface tension of tangent hard - sphere chains at hard walls .",
    "this simple approximation will turn out to be in a good agreement with the simulation data .",
    "the content of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we briefly consider the surface thermodynamics of systems with inhomogeneous density profiles along one direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "this applies for two cases of interest , free liquid ",
    "vapor interfaces and fluid  substrate interfaces .",
    "having considered this formal aspects , we present the new method proposed for the calculation of interface tensions in section iii . results for the different systems studied , from the lennard ",
    "jones fluid to athermal chains is presented in section iv , where comparison is made to dft results and scaled particle theory .",
    "finally , section v presents our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will study the thermodynamics of systems having an inhomogeneous interface profile along a single direction , @xmath0 .",
    "this includes two systems of interest , among others .",
    "one consists of ( say ) a liquid slab surrounded by vapor ( or any other coexisting phase ) in a system with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "the other is a fluid in contact with a substrate , with periodic boundary conditions only in the directions perpendicular to @xmath0 . for the sake of generality ,",
    "let the container have orthogonal shape , with sides of length @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( note that in a slit pore the choice of @xmath3 amounts to an arbitrary definition of the dividing surface ) .",
    "work can be done on the system by changing the shape in either of two ways .",
    "firstly , one can perform displacements of the @xmath4 plane along the perpendicular direction .",
    "let @xmath5 be the external pressure exerted on this moving plane .",
    "the work done by an infinitesimal increment of @xmath3 is then given by @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , one can perform perpendicular displacements of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 planes , thereby producing an infinitesimal deformation of the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the resulting amount of work is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average external pressure exerted on the @xmath7 or @xmath8 planes : @xmath11 accordingly , we may write for the infinitesimal changes in energy : @xmath12 where @xmath13 . introducing a grand potential by means of the legendre",
    "transform @xmath14 yields : @xmath15    in practice , we will be concerned with deformations which preserve the volume , hence @xmath16 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath17 in the limit of large @xmath3 , where the two interfaces do not interact any longer , the above derivative is identified with twice the interface tension , @xmath18 . for the more general case where interaction among the interfaces is possible , we may therefore write : @xmath19 note that @xmath20 is a first order homogeneous function of the interface area ( cf .",
    "( [ domega ] ) ) .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath21 this equation will be exploited later on in order to calculate @xmath22 .    in order to make contact with the standard thermodynamics of slit pores ,",
    "two new definitions must be introduced .",
    "firstly , a solvation force is defined as the excess of @xmath5 over the expected bulk pressure @xmath23 .",
    "second , we introduce a surface free energy per unit area , @xmath24 . with these definitions ,",
    "( [ domega ] ) then becomes : @xmath25 the resemblance with the thermodynamics of slit pores is now apparent , although the volume here is just that of the actual system , @xmath26 with no mention of the reservoir .",
    "the equivalence of the two descriptions follows by considering the surface excess free energy .",
    "the free energy increment of a bulk system of equal shape and size is readily obtained either from eq .  ( [ domega ] ) after replacement of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath10 and @xmath5 with the corresponding bulk values or from eq .  ( [ domegaslit ] ) by retaining the first three terms in the right hand side . in either case , we obtain the excess free energy differential that is standard in slit pore thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 where subscript @xmath30 stands for excess amounts over the corresponding bulk property .    whether one uses eq .",
    "( [ domega ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ domegaslit ] ) as the fundamental relation is just a matter of convenience . in experimental work on slit pores ,",
    "one has control over @xmath3 , @xmath31 is difficult to modify and eq .",
    "( [ domegaslit ] ) is more convenient . in the case of the simulations performed in this work eq .",
    "( [ domega ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ domegacstv ] ) will prove more useful since only the independent variables are made explicit and none of these refer to the reservoir , which can not be actually simulated .",
    "furthermore , we expect @xmath32 to converges fast .",
    "indeed , to a good approximation the difference between @xmath32 and @xmath18 arises from contributions well inside the infinitely large slit were @xmath33 is zero anyway .",
    "the method proposed is conceptually very simple , and resembles other known methods where the simulation s box shape is allowed to fluctuate @xcite . in the absence of any other constraint , the shape of the system at fixed temperature , chemical potential and volume will result from a competition between @xmath10 and @xmath5",
    ". the rules of this competition are dictated by a probability density , @xmath34 , and the corresponding free energy , as follows : @xmath35 this provides the link between the statistical mechanical property , @xmath36 and the macroscopic observables . by use of eq .",
    "( [ omegaextensive ] ) , we find right away : @xmath37 this is the key result of the method proposed : sampling the interface at constant volume from the above distribution will readily yield the interfacial tension . for systems where the interfaces do not interact and both @xmath22 and @xmath5 are system size independent ,",
    "it is clear that the slope of @xmath38 yields the interfacial tension right away . for finite systems , @xmath39 the analysis is complicated by the non - trivial dependence of @xmath32 and also @xmath40 . if sufficiently fine data ara available , however , one can still recover @xmath32 , since , according to eq .",
    "( [ domegacstv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ probansatz ] ) , we have @xmath41    in practice , however , eq .  ( [ thermodistribution ] ) as stated above is hardly useful , because @xmath34 is a monotonous function ; i.e. , the unconstrained system does not have an equilibrium state and during a simulation it will either stretch infinitely in order to eliminate the interface if @xmath22 is positive , or increase its lateral size continuously if @xmath22 is positive .    in order to overcome this difficulty , two different solutions seem possible .",
    "one is to add an extra work contribution that counterbalances the interfacial tension ( balance sampling ) , yielding a proper equilibrium state .",
    "the other one is to constraint the system s area within a bracketed interval chosen conveniently ( bracketed sampling ) . in practice ,",
    "both physical situations amount to the introduction of a modified or constrained probability density of the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a suitably chosen function of @xmath31 .    this distribution may be obtained from knowledge of the molecular interactions by sampling a modified grand canonical probability density of the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the intermolecular potential energy , and @xmath46 is the set of position vectors that define the microstate of a system with overall @xmath27 molecules .",
    "an obvious choice for the evaluation of the above probability density is the standard grand canonical monte carlo method , with the addition of an extra box shape sampling .",
    "the box shape sampling is performed in the same spirit as in the standard npt simulations .",
    "each position vector @xmath47 is transformed into a dimensionless position vector @xmath48 and the relevant density distribution to sample the shape of the simulation box becomes : @xmath49 where we have made explicit the parametric dependence of the intermolecular energy on the box shape that results from the transformation .      in this section",
    "we discuss the implementation of the proposed method using monte carlo simulations for the sampling of eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "other possible choices such as the wang ",
    "landau sampling @xcite , and molecular dynamics will not be discussed here but are also possible .",
    "a simulation box of suitable size is chosen with initial values of @xmath50 about twice those of @xmath51 .",
    "the simulation is then carried out using a standard grand canonical method , organized in cycles of several regular canonical and grand canonical trials . after the end of each cycle",
    ", a box deformation is attempted as follows .",
    "first , an area increment @xmath52 is chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath53 $ ] and a new trial area @xmath54 is proposed .",
    "the new box parameters are set accordingly as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the attempted move is then accepted with probability : @xmath57 obviously , the choice of @xmath58 is a crucial issue for the performance of the method . at first sight , a work contribution that competes against the @xmath59 term so as to produce a well defined equilibrium state seems the most appropriate .",
    "unfortunately , due to the small systems considered the equilibrium value of @xmath31 must fall within a fairly limited interval .",
    "whereas this is can be achieved in principle , in practice it amounts to a good _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , after several attempts with possible @xmath58 functions , it was found that the most convenient procedure is simply to bracket the interface area within an interval chosen beforehand , by means of the following @xmath58 function : @xmath60 within the chosen interval , the method produces the probability distribution of eq .",
    "( [ thermodistribution ] ) . for non",
    " interacting interfaces , a logarithmic plot of @xmath34 yields the interfacial tension right away , while for interacting interfaces , eq .",
    "( [ derivative ] ) would have to be employed in order to determine @xmath32 . in the former case , routine calculation of interfacial tensions",
    "may become somewhat cumbersome , and a simpler data analysis might be desirable .",
    "one such possibility is to exploit the expectation value of the surface area , which reads : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the root of the above equation is the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath22 given @xmath64 and may be solved by means of a newton - raphson method .",
    "the first order solution , @xmath65 , may be used as an excellent first guess , producing convergence in less than four iterations .",
    "in fact , this approximation is good in most practical situations , as it produces deviations that are less than 3% from the exact solution for values of @xmath66 in the range @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "so far , the methodology described applies for the calculation of interfacial tensions in an open system .",
    "the choice of variables , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is appropriate for calculating tensions of a fluid against a wall .",
    "interfacial tensions between two coexisting phases are also of great importance , but the thermodynamic description employed here is not applicable right away .",
    "an initial state with two such phases will spontaneously transform into one or the other phase and completely eliminate the interface .",
    "this problem is solved immediately simply by replacing @xmath68 with @xmath27 as the natural variable , with the number of particles fixed within the immiscibility gap .",
    "all the framework that was employed in this section is then immediately applicable by simply replacing the grand free energy by the helmholtz free energy , and ignoring the sampling over the particle number .",
    "the bracketed interfacial area sampling described in the previous section will be applied to the study of four different systems .",
    "firstly , we will consider an argon like model , with pair interactions that only depend on the mutual distance , @xmath71 between the atoms and obey the usual lennard  jones potential : @xmath72 secondly , a central force potential of the square well type will also be considered : @xmath73 where @xmath74 defines the width of the square well and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the usual range and energy parameters of the models .",
    "thirdly , we will consider a well known bead  spring polymer model which has been extensively studied . in this model ,",
    "all beads interact with each other , whether in the same or different polymer by means of a truncated and shifted lennard ",
    "jones potential with @xmath77 .",
    "additionally , adjacent beads within the same polymer are held together by means of a finite extensible non elastic ( fene ) potential of the form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 plays the role of spring constant and @xmath80 is the maximum allowed displacement between bonded beads . whereas for the simple atomic fluids only the vapor ",
    "liquid interfacial tensions will be calculated , for the polymer we will also report wall  fluid interface tensions . the polymers will thus be confined between two parallel plates in the usual slit pore geometry , with fluid  substrate interactions of the form : @xmath81 where @xmath31 plays the role of a hamaker constant .",
    "the last model considered in this work will be a chain of freely jointed tangent hard sphere chains . in this case , beads interact with each other via a hard sphere potential of the form @xmath82 monomer within the same chain have a fixed bond length of @xmath75 , and are thus bonded tangentially .",
    "the only other constraint is the non  local hard sphere interaction between beads more than one segment apart , so that the chain is otherwise fully flexible .",
    "we will consider systems with slit pore geometry and a purely repulsive and athermal wall of the form : @xmath83    [ [ section ] ]        the methodology proposed was first explored and tested using the lennard  jones fluid , since several other methods have already been tested for this system .",
    "the interactions were truncated at @xmath84 , with no further shift of the potential ( this corresponds to the spherically truncated st lennard  jones model of trokhymchuk and alejandre @xcite ) .",
    "the simulated boxes had an initial size of 13x13x45 , containing a total of 2137 particles .",
    "the production stage was organized in cycles .",
    "each such cycle consisted of 2000 attempted canonical attempts to displace a particle .",
    "half of these attempts were standard metropolis displacements set to yield about 50% acceptance .",
    "the remaining half consist of biased deletion  insertion movements @xcite .",
    "first , a particle chosen at random was deleted .",
    "the particle was then inserted in one among several randomly chosen positions with a probability given by the corresponding rosenbluth weights .",
    "the attempted displacement was accepted or rejected following the configurational bias rules @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this trial move will accelerate the proper equilibration between the vapor and liquid phases and provide a better sampling of the interface than the metropolis movements alone .",
    "after the end of each cycle , a box deformation attempt was performed , with @xmath85 set during the equilibration period to yield about 50% acceptance .",
    "averages were collected over about half million cycles to one million cycles .    before considering the performance of the method proposed in the previous section , with the specific bracketing choice for @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "( [ bracket ] ) ) , it is interesting to consider the performance of an alternative counter tension function selected so as to produce a proper equilibrium state .",
    "the surface tension will favor states such that @xmath59 is minimum . in order to equilibrate this contribution , an extra term acting in the opposite direction",
    "is needed .",
    "a possible choice that was considered is : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is introduced in the equation so that the parameter @xmath88 has the same dimensions as @xmath22 . at constant @xmath27 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the relevant helmholtz free energy for the system in this case is simply : @xmath89 minimizing the free energy it is found that the equilibrium state of the surface area is such that : @xmath90 therefore , the average interfacial area obtained from a simulation allows to calculate the surface tension .",
    "an obvious way to test the above equation is by performing several simulations with different @xmath88 values .",
    "a plot of @xmath91 against @xmath88 will produce a straight line with slope @xmath22 .",
    "this test is shown in the inset of fig.[gammaljst ] for the st  lj model at @xmath92 .",
    "the plot clearly shows a straight line with slope @xmath93 , in good agreement with the @xmath94 result suggested by trokhymchuk and alejandre from explicit evaluation of the virial @xcite . in that figure , results obtained by the balance method for several other temperatures",
    "is also shown .",
    "good agreement with ref .",
    "is found in most cases .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the results , together with the average surface area and @xmath88 values employed is reported in table [ tabgammalj ] .",
    "this is an important parameter , because @xmath22 is known to show a significant dependence on the lateral system size @xcite .",
    "our results were performed for similar system sizes as those reported in ref .",
    "and the comparison shows good agreement . the only large discrepancy is found for the relatively high temperature @xmath95 , close to the critical point . a reliable estimate of @xmath22 at such high temperature is difficult for several reasons .",
    "the interface width diverges close to the critical point , the bulk densities are attained only asymptotically slow and the results will depend also on the perpendicular length @xmath3 and the length between the two interfaces as well .",
    "one advantage of the method proposed here is that the interface is allowed to fluctuate , so that the value of @xmath22 that is obtained is averaged out over a finite interval of lateral lengths . for high temperatures these fluctuations",
    "can be large .",
    "indeed , the interfacial areas sampled during the simulation of the system at @xmath95 for @xmath96 fall broadly in an interval of lateral lengths between 10 and 14@xmath75 . unfortunately , these large fluctuations could actually be more a matter of concern than an advantage .",
    "for a very large system , the fluctuations about the equilibrium interface area will be gaussian , and the average interfacial area will be equal to the extremum of the distribution . for finite systems as in our simulations ,",
    "the large fluctuations imply that the interface area is actually sampling a non gaussian skewed distribution of the form @xmath97 , with @xmath98 the random variable and @xmath99 and @xmath100 some coefficients .",
    "in such a case , the average and the extremum may deviate significantly , and eq .",
    "( [ mincon ] ) might not be a reliable estimate of the surface tension .",
    "however , the most important problem with the counter tension methodology is in fact the choice of @xmath88 .",
    "note that the average surface area that resulted from our simulations is such that the lateral length remains close to the initial value @xmath101 for most temperatures ( cf .",
    "table [ tabgammalj ] ) .",
    "obviously , a look at eq .",
    "( [ mincon ] ) shows that this can not be achieved accidentally . for an arbitrary choice of @xmath88 ,",
    "the resulting equilibrium geometry may produce problems .",
    "for any @xmath88 larger than @xmath22 , it is clear that the average equilibrium surface is larger than @xmath102 . as a result ,",
    "the lateral length becomes larger than the perpendicular length , and the system becomes metastable : i.e. , the liquid slab will have tendency to rotate by @xmath103 so as to achieve a minimal surface area . for values of @xmath88 that are too large , on the contrary , the simulation box will stretch very much and produce a long slab with very small surface area .",
    "the surface tension that is obtained will then strongly depend on the equilibrium state , while use of eq .",
    "( [ mincon ] ) which was derived by ignoring the system size dependence of @xmath22 could be again not adequate .",
    "obviously , one can always choose @xmath88 such that @xmath64 falls within some desired range as it was done in this work , but this implies a reasonable first guess of @xmath22 , which is not always at hand .",
    "the bracketed interfacial area sampling proposed in the previous section overcomes all of these problems .",
    "firstly , the sampling interval may be set at will right away , avoiding visits to undesired regions .",
    "secondly , no prior knowledge of @xmath22 is required .",
    "table [ tabgammalj ] shows the results obtained using the bracketing sampling strategy .",
    "overall good agreement with both the virial and the balance sampling method is found , though the results for the near to critical temperature @xmath95 are again in conflict with those obtained from the virial method . on the other hand , both methods employed in this work provide results in fair agreement for that temperature , given that the lateral system sizes studied differ considerably and the counter tension method could suffer from the problems discussed above .",
    "one important issue with the bracket sampling is the choice of bracketing interval @xmath104 $ ] . on the one hand ,",
    "a large interval is difficult to explore , because the states with large surface area are exponentially suppressed and so will suffer from poor sampling . on the other hand , large @xmath105 and @xmath106 values",
    "will lead to a small relative error of the slope , @xmath107 . clearly , choosing the optimal value is not a trivial matter , although we expect the optimal choice will depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath108 . for @xmath109 and @xmath110 two",
    "set of simulations with different values of @xmath88 were performed . in set",
    "@xmath28 , a small interval was chosen , corresponding to a small expected @xmath88 of about 1 .",
    "on the contrary , in set @xmath111 we chose @xmath112 such that @xmath113 varied about 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the statistical analysis based on partial results of @xmath114 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ avgamma ] ) after averaging the surface over 500,000 cycles remain inconclusive .",
    "the error as measured from the standard deviation of the sample is very similar in both sets , and no significant differences in the mean are observed either .",
    "for the state point at @xmath109 set s yields @xmath115 while two independent runs of set l produced @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath110 set s",
    "produced @xmath118 while set l yield @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "calculation of the surface tension from the anisotropy of the pressure tensor is particularly difficult for fluids with discontinuous potentials . in such cases",
    ", there appears a delta dirac in the virial expression for every discontinuity in the potential . in practice",
    ", this means that the instantaneous virial can only be measured approximately and that the computer program must be tailored for each model .",
    "the method of interface sampling has the advantage of not requiring explicit evaluation of the virial , and this may prove particularly advantageous in this case .    in this section the simple square ",
    "well fluid with @xmath121 is chosen as a prototypical discontinuous model potential .",
    "simulations were performed on systems containing overall 2222 atoms and initial system size of 13x13x45 .",
    "the sampling strategy is exactly the same as with the lennard  jones fluid , with cycles of 2222 center of mass and configurational bias moves in the ratio 50:50 .",
    "the difficulties in sampling the square well fluid interface are illustrated by considering the counter tension method explained in the previous section . in order to achieve a reasonable acceptance rate for the box deformations , the maximal random displacement has to be set to very small values , and it becomes difficult for the system to reach a meaningful equilibrium value of the interface area .",
    "for a temperature of @xmath110 a value of @xmath122 was required to achieve the prescribed 50% acceptance ratio in box deformations . on the other hand ,",
    "a value of @xmath123 was obtained for the lennard  jones fluid at the lowest temperature studied . assuming a simple random walk for the interface displacements",
    ", this would imply that the square well fluid needs @xmath124 more cycles than the lennard  jones in order to sample the same surface area . in this conditions ,",
    "the counter tension method becomes inefficient and the bracket sampling strategy with a small interval of about @xmath125 is more convenient .",
    "even so , the simulations were performed over ten million cycles in order to achieve error bars comparable to those obtained for the lennard  jones .",
    "the results obtained using the bracket sampling are shown in table [ tabsw ] .",
    "good agreement with previous results using the virial method , the test area method and binder s method is found @xcite .    in the test area method ,",
    "a simulation is carried out in an nvt ensemble of fixed shape .",
    "every cycle , a ` test ' deformation at constant volume is performed , and the corresponding change in configurational energy , @xmath126 is measured .",
    "following gloor et al .",
    ", it can be shown that the surface tension is given as : @xmath127 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes that the interface is sampled over the unperturbed system . in the limit where the method becomes exact",
    ", it becomes equivalent to measuring the anisotropy of the pressure tensor , with the virial evaluated numerically instead of analytically .",
    "indeed , for small enough deformations , the instantaneous energy change may be written as : @xmath128 accordingly , an asymptotically exact taylor expansion of eq.([tam ] ) yields right away @xmath129 from the canonical partition function one can show that the analytical derivative in this equation is just the anisotropy of the pressure tensor .",
    "both the tam method and the interface sampling proposed in this work have the advantage of avoiding the explicit calculation of the virial .",
    "however , the interface sampling method could avoid difficulties encountered with the tam method due to the nonequivalence between compressing and expanding the interface in discontinuous systems @xcite .",
    "for very small deformations the three methods should become equivalent , although the virial method would seem to yield results with smaller error bars @xcite .      in this section the interfacial tensions of the bead ",
    "spring polymer model described at the begining of this section are considered .",
    "the interfacial properties of chains with 10 beads at a subcritical temperature of @xmath130 have been studied previously and are well known @xcite .",
    "the liquid ",
    "vapor surface tension has been calculated using binder s method , while the spreading coefficients @xmath131 were also evaluated with a related method all the way from the wetting to the drying transition @xcite .",
    "the interfacial tensions of the glassy polymer in narrow slit pores have also been measured using the virial method @xcite .",
    "simulations for the polymer model were carried out in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the chemical potential was fixed to its coexistence value and the initial box size was set to 13.8x13.8x27.6 ( i.e. , for the liquid state , this amounts to about 315 polymers in the simulation box ) .",
    "the configurational space was sampled by means of center of mass displacements , standard canonical configurational bias displacements and grand canonical configurational bias insertion / deletion attempts in the ratio 25:25:50 . for the vapor phase",
    "only the last two kinds of trial moves were attempted .",
    "the maximum allowed box deformation attempts were adjusted during the equilibration period so as to provide roughly a 50% acceptance ratio .",
    "averages were collected over roughly 1.5 million cycles for wall  liquid tensions and about 5 million cycles for the wall  vapor tensions .",
    "the results obtained for both the wall  liquid and wall ",
    "vapor interface tensions may be found in table [ tabfenelj ] .",
    "also included are the differences @xmath131 previously calculated using two different methods .",
    "the comparison shows excellent agreement for the spreading coefficient and thus provides strong support for the methodology . the liquid ",
    "vapor surface tension was also calculated using the interface sampling in the canonical ensemble with a 13.5x13.5x50 box geometry and 185 molecules .",
    "the result , @xmath132 is in good agreement with previous measurements using binder s method , @xmath133 @xcite .    for many practical applications , the relevant property is not really the surface tensions alone , but the corresponding spreading coefficient , which governs both the wetting behavior of a single interface and the capillary condensation / evaporation phenomenology . figure [ gammafene ] shows the results of the spreading coefficient as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "the points were the spreading coefficient cross the liquid ",
    "vapor surface tensions indicate the location of wetting / drying transitions .",
    "independent measurement of the tensions remains interesting , because it allows to compare the free energy of the wall ",
    "fluid interface relative to that of a bulk system of equal volume .",
    "such data is useful for comparison with self  consistent and density functional theories , but can be also relevant in process were the interface is free to grow , i.e. , nucleation or self assembly of biological systems .",
    "table [ tabfenelj ] shows that both @xmath135 and @xmath136 are negative for strongly attractive walls but change sign as the effective hamaker constant decreases . for positive but small values of @xmath134",
    "the weak attractive interactions are not able to compensate for the free energy cost of a inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "the fact that the liquid phase requires a wall strength larger than @xmath137 before it becomes negative is consistent with previously observed density profiles , which remain considerably depleted for @xmath134 as large as @xmath138 and only start to develop monomer like oscillatory behavior at about that value . actually , @xmath136 is about one order of magnitude larger than @xmath135 all the way from @xmath139 to @xmath140 , and dominates completely the behavior of @xmath141 . at @xmath139 both",
    "the wall  vapor and wall  liquid interfaces are unfavorable relative to the corresponding bulk phases , and the drying transition is actually driven by the very unfavorable wall  liquid interface .      having studied the performance of the method for fluids with discontinuous potentials ( square well ) and for polymer chains ( fene  lj ) , we now consider a fluid made of tangent hard sphere chains adsorbed on purely repulsive athermal walls .",
    "this system has been subject of great interest in the last decade , as a prototypical model for the study of polymer  wall interfaces , as well as a test bead for density functional theories @xcite .",
    "we have considered chains of 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 monomers adsorbed on a hard wall . for each chain , we have calculated the interface tensions corresponding to six different bulk densities of approximately 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 and 0.6 monomers per @xmath142 .",
    "we first performed bulk nvt simulations for those densities , and evaluated the chemical potential by means of widom s test particle method .",
    "for the largest chains at heigh density , widom s test failed and the grand potential could not be properly evaluated .",
    "an arbitrary value was imposed in those cases , based on the approximation that the excess chemical potential is linear in the chain length .",
    "the values of the chemical potentials employed in the simulations are collected in table [ chempot ] .",
    "once the desired chemical potential was known , grand canonical simulations were performed on a system with initial size of 15x15x35 .",
    "the grand canonical distribution function was sampled by using center of mass , rotation , configurational bias and grand canonical configurational bias insertion / deletion moves in the ratio 15:15:35:35 , except for dimers , were the ratio was set to 15:15:0:70 .",
    "after suitable equilibration , averages were collected over 3 to 7 million cycles , with longer runs required for the highest densities .",
    "the choice of bracketing interval in this case is also a matter of concern , since the conditions change over a wide interval , and the trial displacements required to achieve 50% acceptance in the box shape moves varies from about @xmath143 to about @xmath144 as the monomer density increases from @xmath145 to @xmath146 ( this parameter being much less sensitive to chain length ) . at this stage",
    "we developed a systematic method to decide the size of the lateral size sampling interval which works well .",
    "a short simulation of about 100000 cycles is performed , and the lateral size mean squared displacement is calculated . a plot as a function of monte carlo cycles shows an initial linear and steady growth corresponding to the unconstrained diffusion process , followed by a plateau occasioned by the reflecting boundary conditions on the lateral size ( fig .",
    "[ msd ] ) .",
    "measuring an effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath147 , from the slope of the mean squared displacement within the first regime allows to estimate the expected lateral size displacement within a given number of cycles .",
    "obviously , the lateral size needs to have reflected several many times if meaningful averages are to be collected .",
    "therefore , the size of the sampling interval required for the condition to be obeyed within a prescribed amount , @xmath148 of mc cycles may be estimated from @xmath147 . in practice , we chose the sampling interval from the distance traveled during 10000 cycles .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in table [ tabthsc ] . as seen from the table ,",
    "the surface tensions could be evaluated with relative errors lying between 1 and 10% , with accuracy deteriorating at the highest densities .",
    "inspection of the results as plotted in fig.[gammathsc ] shows the interface tensions are always positive , increase with monomer density and decrease with chain length .",
    "simulation results suggest an asymptotic behavior for long chains at low densities . for higher densities ,",
    "however , the error bars are too large and this trend can not be confirmed .",
    "hooper et al . have calculated interface tensions of athermal chains with no intramolecular excluded volume interactions @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the interface tensions of a 20-mer first increases with density , but then gradually decreases and actually becomes negative at heigh densities .",
    "the different behavior is related to the choice of dividing surface ( cf .",
    "eq.([athermalwall ] ) . in this work",
    "the dividing surface coincides with the actuall wall surface ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) , while hooper et al .",
    "assume that the dividing surface is located at the distance of the closest approach of a segment to the surface ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) .",
    "our results can be easily recalculated to another choice of the dividing surface by using the simple relation @xmath151 , where the subscripts stand for the location of the dividing surface and @xmath152 is the bulk pressure ( cf .",
    "( 4.3 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "this equation shows that our choice of dividing surface yields what is sometimes known as the intermolecular contribution to the interfacial tension . for the proposed method ,",
    "the choice of dividing surface is implied in the volume definition.@xcite here we have employed @xmath153 , while restricting the system s volume to that space available to the molecule s center of mass we would require @xmath154 ( a slit pore is used in practice , so @xmath155 must be substracted twice ) .",
    "these definitions dictate the length to breadth ratio of attempted deformations in the monte carlo simulation , and thus produce interfacial tensions according to the choice of dividing surface . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have performed some simulations for chains of length @xmath156 and a dividing surface located at @xmath150 .",
    "fig.[newdividingsurfacem12 ] presents a plot of the simulation results , clearly showing the non  monotomic trend observed by hooper et al @xcite .",

    "the results agree within the error interval .    along with the simulation results , we also include predictions from three different theoretical treatments .",

    "we have developed a method for the efficient calculation of interface tensions by means of computer simulations .",
