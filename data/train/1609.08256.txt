    "the environment is unique in the galaxy because the region contains several peculiar objects .",
    "first , sagittarius a@xmath0 ( sgr a@xmath0 ) is a counter part of the galactic center black hole ( gcbh ) in the regime from radio to x - ray , which is located very near the dynamical center of the galaxy ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reid  2003 ) ) and has a mass of @xmath3m@xmath4 ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * ghez  2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "second , the  circum - nuclear disk ( cnd ) \" is a torus - like molecular gas rotating around sgr a@xmath0 , which is identified at the distance to a few pc ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gsten  1987 ) ) .",
    "a bundle of the ionized gas streams is located in the inner cavity of the cnd .",
    "this is called  galactic center mini - spiral ( gcms ) \" ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ekers  1983 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lo&claussen 1983 ) ) . the stretched appearance and kinematics with large velocity gradient suggest that it is a tentative structure surrounding sgr a@xmath0 . finally , the central cluster is a star cluster centered at sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "though the cluster concentrates within @xmath5 pc , it contains @xmath6100 ob and wr stars ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* genzel  1996 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paumard  2006 ) ) .",
    "there remains considerable controversy about the cluster origin .",
    "it would be difficult to form the cluster in a way by which stars are usually formed in the galactic disk because of the following reasons .",
    "the tidal force of sgr a@xmath0 must have a serious effect on the star formation because the minimum number h@xmath7 density for stabilization toward the tidally shearing is @xmath8h@xmath9 @xmath10 at @xmath5 pc ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , the strong lyman continuum radiation from the early type stars in the cluster ionizes rapidly the ism in the region . because the star formation in the vicinity of the sgr a@xmath0 requires an additional mechanism to overcome the difficulties , it is still an open question how the central cluster is formed .",
    "two distinct but compatible scenarios for the formation of the central cluster have been proposed .",
    "one is current in - situ star formation in such extreme environment of the vicinity of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "previous observations have revealed that there are many molecular clumps in the cnd(e.g .",

    "cloud - cloud collision in the cnd is proposed as the star formation mechanism in the region ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * jalali  2014 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , we find no cradle dense molecular clouds around massive stars in the inner cavity of the cnd at present .",
    "the other is that the molecular cloud is falling from the region considerably far from sgr a@xmath0 to the vicinity after star formation have already started in the cloud .",

    "the continuum emission of the gcms and sgr a@xmath0 was subtracted from the spectral data using the casa task uvcontsub .",

    "we found a filamentary molecular cloud extending from @xmath26 , @xmath27 to @xmath28 , @xmath29 in figure 1a .",

    "the velocity increases as approaching the south end .",
    "although the filamentary molecular cloud is prominent in the cs 2 - 1 emission line , this had never been identified by existing telescopes because it is deeply embedded in the cnd . however , this is distinguishable clearly from other clouds belong to the cnd with the curved filamentary appearance revealed by the high angular resolution of alma . on the other hand ,",
    "the filamentary molecular cloud is not prominent in the sio emission line except around the south end , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this indicates that the cloud suffers from strong shock around the south end although there is no evidence of strong shock in the other parts of the cloud .",
    "the south end of the molecular cloud has the very wide velocity width of @xmath35 km s@xmath13 . while there is another component along the",
    " western arc \" of the gcms in figures 1a and 1b .",
    "this component probably belongs to the cnd .",
    "meanwhile , figure 1c shows the integrated intensity map ( pseudo color ) of the gcms in the h42@xmath2 recombination line ( pseudo color ) .",
    "the h42@xmath2 recombination line is an ionized gas tracer .",
    "the south end seems to be connected continuously to the north extension of the  eastern arm \" and  northeastern arm \" of the gcms ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsuboi  2016b ) ) .",
    "although the velocity width of the north extension is as large as @xmath36 km s@xmath13 , the central velocity is @xmath37 km s@xmath13 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsuboi  2016b ) ) and overlaps to that of the south end of the molecular cloud .",
    "the central velocity of the molecular cloud is also continuous with that of the ionized gas in the arms .",
    "the morphological and kinematic properties suggest that the molecular cloud continues to the ionized gas physically .",
    "as mentioned above , the shocked gas traced by the sio emission is located around the boundary of these .",
    "the molecular cloud is ionized by the lyman continuum from the central cluster as approaching to sgr a@xmath0 and expands at several hundreds times because the gas temperature increases from several @xmath38 k to @xmath39 k. therefore the interaction between the molecular gas and ionized gas probably produces a shock wave around the interface .",
    "the filamentary molecular cloud is probably falling from the outer region to the sgr a region and being disrupted by the tidal shear of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "the star formation in the cloud may have already started by an external trigger like cloud - cloud collision when the cloud was in the region far from sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "shock waves induced by cloud - cloud collision may form massive molecular cloud cores ( e.g. ) .",
    "a possible remnant of such cloud - cloud collision is observed in the 50mc ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsuboi  2015 ) ) . in the case of nearly head - on collision",
    ", the molecular clouds lose their angular momentums and begin to fall toward sgr a@xmath0 . moreover , the formed cores in the clouds can not be destroyed by the tidal force because of their high densities .",
    "the massive cores quickly grow to ob stars .",
    "the speculation is consistent with the fact that the ob stars are observed on the dust peaks in the gcms ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsuboi  2016a ) ) . while less massive cores gradually grows to low mass stars",
    ". these may be still on the stage of protostars in the gcms .",

    "* yusef - zadeh  2015 ) ) .",
    "they are located exclusively on the approaching tip of the  northeastern arm \" .",
    "these suggest that the filamentary cloud and gcms play a role in transferring material including protostars from the outer region of the sgr a complex to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "some of the falling stars may be captured around sgr a@xmath0 and others may be scattered far from sgr a@xmath0 ."
