    "<S> in this letter we address the issue how synthetic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling can strongly affect three - body physics in ultracold atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system which consists of three fermionic atoms , including two spinless heavy atoms and one spin-@xmath0 light atom subjected to an isotropic so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that so coupling can induce universal three - body bound states with negative s - wave scattering length at a smaller mass ratio , where no trimer bound state can exist if in the absence of so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of these trimers are independent of high - energy cutoff , and therefore they are universal ones . moreover , the resulting atom - dimer resonance can be effectively controlled by so coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be applied to systems like @xmath1li and @xmath2k mixture .     </S>",
    "<S> universal phenomenon \" refers to observations independent of short - range or high energy details , which is one of the most beautiful and charming parts of physics . </S>",
    "<S> universal physics not only emerges in interacting many - body systems but also exists in quantum mechanical few - body problems . </S>",
    "<S> cold atoms system , because of its diluteness , is an ideal platform to investigate various intriguing phenomena of few - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , efimov trimer with universal scaling factor @xcite has been extensively studied experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another type of trimer whose energy is universal has also been predicted by kartavtsev and malykh @xcite .    on the other hand , thanks to fast experimental developments @xcite , synthetic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling recently emerges as one of the most exciting research directions in cold atom physics @xcite . among many profound effects of so coupling </S>",
    "<S> , one distinct factor is that certain types of so coupling can dramatically change the two - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with rashba - type so coupling , because the low - energy density - of - state is enhanced to a finite constant , any small attractive interaction between atoms can support a two - body bound state in three - dimension , and the binding energy increases with the strength of so coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , </S>",
    "<S> this two - body result dramatically changes many - body physics in the scenario of bec - bcs crossover for spin-@xmath0 fermions @xcite , where the superfluidity is greatly enhanced by so coupling even in the far bcs side @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic effect of so coupling in two - body problem and its profound consequence naturally raises the question whether similar significant manifestation also exists in a three - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far three - body problems with so coupling have not been studied in cold atom content , though historically there were some related studies in investigating nucleus @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study a three - fermion problem which consists of two heavy fermionic @xmath3-atoms with mass @xmath4 and one light fermionic @xmath5-atom with mass @xmath6 , and @xmath3- and @xmath5-atom interact via a zero - range @xmath7-wave interaction in the vicinity of two - body scattering resonances . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3-atom is spinless and @xmath5-atom is spin-@xmath0 . as the first attempt to demonstrate rich physics of so coupling in the few - body cold atoms system , we consider a simply case that only @xmath5-atom is subjected to an isotropic so coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is realistic for cold atoms system , since synthetic so coupling for atoms is induced by atom - light ( or atom - magnetic field ) interaction which can be selectively applied to certain species . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we can consider a mixture of two - component @xmath1li with single component @xmath2k , and the ( pseudo)-spin of @xmath1li is coupled to its momentum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that so coupling leads to intriguing new physics in this three - body system . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant finding is that when @xmath8 ( satisfied by @xmath1li and @xmath2k mixture ) , so coupling can induce universal trimer state whose energy is independent of short - range parameter . </S>",
    "<S> such trimers can exist at the negative scattering length side  a regime where universal trimer can never exist in the absence of so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the locations of three - body resonances are tunable by the strength of so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this result reveals a unique manifestation of so coupling in dilute quantum gases and also adds new control knob to three - body system . </S>",
    "<S> potentially it can also shed light on few - body system of nucleus where so coupling is inevitable .    before proceeding , we shall first briefly review the known results for such an @xmath9 system without so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> two types of trimer states have been found before . </S>",
    "<S> first , when @xmath10 , efimov trimer emerges in both sides nearby resonance . the energy of efimov trimer is not universal since it depends on the high - energy cutoff known as three - body parameter , while the energies of two successive trimers obey a universal scaling behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , when @xmath11 , there exists another type of trimer named as  kartavtsev - malykh \" trimer , whose energy is universal ( i.e. independent of any high - energy cutoff ) @xcite . since the @xmath7-wave scattering length @xmath12 is the only length scale , the trimer energy has to simply scale with two - body binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , such universal trimer appears only for positive @xmath12 when a two - body bound state exists . </S>",
    "<S> due to anti - symmetrization of two @xmath3-atoms , both two types of trimer states have total angular momentum @xmath13 .    _ model . _ </S>",
    "<S> our system is described by hamiltonian @xmath14 , @xmath15\\mathbf{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath16(@xmath17 ) refers to the momentum ( position ) of two @xmath3-atoms , and @xmath18(@xmath19 ) is for @xmath5-atom . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the spin of @xmath5-atom , which couples to its momentum via a three - dimensional isotropic so coupling @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> proposals for realizing such a so coupling have been presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7-wave contact interaction @xmath25 only takes place between @xmath5-atom and @xmath3-atom , and the interaction strength is assumed to be independent of the spin - index of @xmath5-atom , where @xmath26 in @xmath25 denotes identity operator acting on the spin space of @xmath5-atom . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 is related to @xmath12 by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the volume . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that this relation will not be changed by so coupling , as long as @xmath30 is much larger than the range of inter - atomic potential @xcite .    to address the three - body bound state </S>",
    "<S> , we should first solve the two - body problem with one @xmath3- and one @xmath5- atom to determine the atom - dimer threshold , which can be carried out quite straightforwardly with lippman - schwinger equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although our case differs from previous studies of two - body problem with so coupling @xcite where both two atoms are subjected to so coupling , the results are quite similar to previous cases with rashba or three - dimensional isotropic so coupling , i.e. for any mass ratio @xmath31 and for all @xmath12 , a two - body bound state with zero center - of - mass momentum exists , and the dimer energy @xmath32 @xcite . the physical reason is also attributed to the enhancement of density - of - state of @xmath5-atom , which diverges at zero - energy .    for the same three - body system without so coupling , the total orbital angular momentum @xmath33 is a good quantum number and most previous calculations focus on the lowest bound states in @xmath13 channel . after introducing spin degrees of freedom for @xmath5-atom , </S>",
    "<S> these bound states are always six - fold degenerate . in the presence of so coupling , </S>",
    "<S> these states would split into two channels with different total angular momentum @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> they are two states with @xmath35 and four states with @xmath36 .    </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , because of the mixing of different orbital angular momentum channels is an intrinsic effect of so coupling , we anticipate that our results qualitatively hold for a general type of so coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> we also like to point out a common feature between three - body physics and two - body physics , that is , with so coupling , physics at @xmath67 side becomes similar as conventional case at @xmath68 side . in two - body physics , for the type of so coupling we considered here , dimer can form at @xmath67 side . while in three - body physics , universal  </S>",
    "<S> kartavtsev - malykh \" trimer can now form at @xmath67 side . </S>",
    "<S> both features are reminiscent of conventional case with @xmath68 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> final remark . </S>",
    "<S> _ our results can potentially influence many - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> when the trimer energies touch the atom - dimer threshold , it will lead to an atom - dimer resonance where atom - dimer scattering length will change dramatically . without so coupling , usually the resonance position of efimov trimer </S>",
    "<S> is controlled by three - body parameter @xmath91 , which is not tunable for a given mixture . </S>",
    "<S> while with so coupling , the resonance position of universal trimer is controlled by @xmath64 , which can be tuned quite flexibly by so coupling strength @xmath92 . </S>",
