    "the large equivalent width of the line and the drop in continuum level at the emission line ( similar to the continuum drop across the ly@xmath2 emission line in distant quasars due to intervening ly@xmath2 forest absorption , e.g. steidel & sargent , 1987 , and references therein ) along with the faint @xmath1 band identification and the small ultra steep spectrum radio source led us to tentatively identify the line with lyman @xmath2 at @xmath48 .",
    "the redshifted ly@xmath2 line lies close to the strong 5577   skyline making a more exact redshift determination difficult from the low resolution spectrum .",
    "the infrared spectroscopic observation showed two bright emission lines in @xmath41 band ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these were identified with the [ oiii]@xmath494959,5007   emission lines , indicating that the supposed redshift is indeed correct .",

    "the spectrum of the emission lines in the infrared has much lower signal to noise ratio than that of ly@xmath2 in the optical .",
    "therefore any faint [ oiii ] emission in the region outside the radio lobes , if the [ oiii ] would be equally extended as the ly@xmath2 ( see below ) , could not be detected .",

    "the northern lobe ( designated ` a ' ) has a compact component with a ` tail ' extending to the north .",
    "the southern lobe ( designated ` b ' ) again has a compact component ( b1 ) close to the nucleus , and a linear series of knots ( the southern ` jet ' ) , extending towards the south from b1 , with a slight extension to the west at its southern end . in between these two lobes",

    "spectral index values between 8.3 ghz and 4.7 , ghz determined from the surface brightness of the various source components convolved to the same resolution , are also listed in table 2 .",
    "most components of the radio source have steep spectra , with indices typically @xmath52 .",
    "the two exceptions are components b1 and n , both of which have flatter spectral indices of @xmath53 .",
    "one curious aspect of the 1243 + 036 radio structure is that the spectral index distribution steepens with distance from the source centre in both components a and b. this is unlike most high power radio galaxies , which show the flattest spectral indices at the radio hot spots situated at the extremities of the radio source ( @xcite ) .",
    "this spectral steepening may be due to synchrotron radiation losses of the highest energy electrons .",
    "we assume minimum energy conditions ( see miley 1980 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) to derive a minimum magnetic field strength . in calculating the minimum energies we assume that the radio source is cylindrically symmetric",
    ", the plasma has unit filling factor and that the synchrotron spectrum extends from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ghz . for the components with high frequency spectral index",
    "@xmath56 a two  slope power - law spectrum was assumed with a spectral index below 4.7 ghz ( observed frame ) of @xmath22 , equal to the integrated source spectral index between 178 mhz and 2700 mhz .",
    "the derived parameters for the various components are in table 3 .",
    "we can estimate the density of the external medium assuming that the minimum pressures are balanced by either ram pressure , due to the propagation of the radio plasma at a velocity of a few thousand km s@xmath5 ( e.g. cygnus a , carilli et  al .",
    "1991 and references therein ) , or by thermal pressure from a hot ( @xmath57 k ) external medium , which is often found to be present around powerful radio galaxies and in clusters at low redshifts ( see crawford et  al . 1988 ; baum et  al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) .",
    "for the typical source parameters , we find that the external density ranges from 0.1 cm@xmath5 ( ram pressure ) to several tens cm@xmath5 ( thermal pressure ) , see table 4 .    assuming that the spectral steepening of the outer components relative to the inner components is due to synchrotron radiation losses",
    ", we crudely estimate the synchrotron age of the emitting radio plasma in a few components from the break frequency where the radio spectrum steepens and the magnetic field strength .",
    "we estimate the restframe break frequency by fitting a `` kardashev - pacholczyk model '' to the spectral index distribution in figs . 5a and 5b and assuming that the input spectral index @xmath59 ( spectral index at frequencies below the synchrotron break ) . for more details about spectral ageing modelling",
    "see carilli et  al .",
    "the synchrotron age of the radio plasma is given by : @xmath60 myr with b in @xmath61 g and @xmath62 in ghz , see carilli et  al .",
    "we note however that there are large uncertainties in these ages , because of the strong dependence on the magnetic fields that are derived from the high restframe frequencies only . in any case , the derived synchrotron ages give an impression of the age of the outer components ( b4 ) relative to the inner components ( b1 ) .",
    "the derived synchrotron ages for the components a1 , b1 and b4 are listed in table 3 .",
    "images of polarized intensity from 1243 + 036 are shown in fig .",
    "6 , along with vectors representing the position angle of the electric field vectors .",
    "the only component that shows substantial polarization at both frequencies is the southern jet ( components b2 , b3 , and b4 ) .",
    "component a shows weak polarization at 8.3 ghz , and no polarized emission at 4.7 ghz , and components b1 and n show no polarized emission at either frequency .",
    "the fractional polarization of these various components ( 4@xmath63 upper limit for b1 ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "also listed are the depolarization ratios , d@xmath64 , for the components with detected polarized signal , where d@xmath64 is the ratio of fractional polarization at 4.7 ghz to that at 8.3 ghz .",
    "component b4 shows no significant depolarization between 4.7 ghz and 8.3 ghz , while component b2 has a value of d@xmath64 = 0.55 , and a1 only has an upper limit ( 4@xmath63 ) of d@xmath64 @xmath65 0.3 .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties in observed position angle in the brighter polarized regions are about 2@xmath26 , based on signal - to - noise and possible systematic errors of @xmath81@xmath26 discussed in sect .  2 .",
    "overall , we feel that a position angle change of @xmath66 6@xmath67 between 8.3 ghz and 4.7 ghz could have been measured with this data at the peaks in polarized intensity .",
    "no such change is seen , implying an upper limit to the rest frame rotation measures of @xmath81000 rad m@xmath68 .",
    "this limit applies to the regions that are not depolarized .    the projected magnetic field distribution is shown in fig .  7 overlayed on the 8.3 ghz total intensity map . in the southern region ,",
    "the projected field is parallel to the jet , and then bends towards the west in the vicinity of knot b4 . in the north",
    "the projected field is parallel to the ` tail ' of component a towards the northwest . towards the west of knot b4",
    "there is slightly extended radio emission visible at all three radio frequencies .",
    "this emission and the change of the magnetic field direction at that position suggest that this may be outflow from the final hotspot ( b4 ) into the radio lobe .",
    "the @xmath1 band image identifying the radio source is from rttgering et  al .",

    "the optical identification is a faint @xmath25@xmath69 extended galaxy with an integrated magnitude of @xmath70 ( @xcite ) . in the low resolution optical spectrum , continuum emission is detected but no emission lines were detected in the @xmath1 band region of the spectrum .",
    "the strongest emission line that might affect the @xmath1 band flux is civ@xmath391549   ( expected at 7079  ) but was not detected , so that the @xmath1 band does not contain any appreciable contribution ( less than 1% ) from line emission .",

    "the sizes of components were measured from the ly@xmath2 image and high resolution spectroscopy and were assumed to be cylindrically symmetric .",
    "the values derived in table 5 indicate that the density of the ionized gas falls off with radius as @xmath111 .",
    "this would mean that in the case of anisotropic nuclear photoionization the ionization parameter would be about the same at all radii .",

    "cooling flows mass deposition rates up to several hundred m@xmath116 yr@xmath5 have been deduced ( see fabian 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the mass of the _ ionized gas _ in the outer halo of 1243 + 036 in the observed area that was covered by the slit in orientation pa1 , is of order 10@xmath144 m@xmath116 ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) . in the case of a cooling flow",
    ", the gas has no preferential direction of infall , so that it is not only along the radio axis ( slit orientation pa1 ) , in the ionization cone from the agn , but roughly isotropically distributed around the radio galaxy .",
    "thus , the total mass of cold ( @xmath145 k ) gas in the outer halo all around the galaxy is minimally of order 10@xmath146 m@xmath116 , situated at a radius of @xmath860 kpc .",
    "if the ionized gas represents only a fraction of the total mass , the total amount of gas in the outer halo may be even an order of magnitude higher . at the redshift of 1243 + 036 the cooling time",
    "would have to be shorter than 10@xmath146 years ( the approximate age of the universe at that epoch ) to allow a cooling flow to be the origin of the emission line gas . from an estimated density of 0.1 cm@xmath113 at a radius @xmath810 kpc ( see sect .",
    "4.1 ) , temperature @xmath147 k and the cooling function from thomas ( 1988 ) , the cooling time is @xmath810@xmath144 years . the density in a hot halo decreases with radius at a rate between @xmath148 and @xmath111 , and the cooling time increases as @xmath149 with constant temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "then at @xmath150 kpc the cooling time is longer than in the inner part of the ly@xmath2 halo , but is still @xmath810@xmath146 years .",
    "thus it may be possible that a massive cooling flow has deposited a large amount of gas in the outer halo of 1243 + 036 .",
    "a problem for the cooling flow hypothesis is the large velocity shear of the outer halo . in a cooling flow , this is expected to be only a few tens of kilometers per second ( fabian 1994 ; fabian et  al .",
    "1987 ) , an order of magnitude smaller than that observed in 1243 + 036 . a flow velocity of only 20 km s@xmath5 means a mass deposition rate of @xmath81000 m@xmath116 yr@xmath5 within a radius of 60 kpc , assuming a density of 0.1 cm@xmath113 .",
    "fabian et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggests that galaxy interactions are most likely to cause large velocities and keplerian motion of the gas deposited by a cooling flow .",
    "thus even though a cooling flow may be at least in part responsible for the presence of the emission line gas in the outer halo of 1243 + 036 , it can not explain the observed velocity shear .",
    "an additional mechanism , e.g. a galaxy interaction is needed to account for that . however , unless our arguments about the orientation of the radio source are wrong , i.e. the enhanced , blueshifted ly@xmath2 at the projected position of bending point b1 is coincidental and the polarization asymmetry is due to some extraordinary geometry of the magnetoionic halo , we regard the infall of gas as the most unlikely explanation of the velocity shear .    in summary , we think that rotation due to accretion of gas associated with the formation of the galaxy is the most plausible origin for the presence and kinematics of the outer halo , but outflow in the form of a ` superwind ' may also be feasible",
    ". a cooling flow may contribute to the presence of the gas but can not be the cause of the velocity shear .",
    "infall in general seems excluded by the most likely orientation of the radio source .",
    "regardless of the actual origin of the gas in the outer halo and its velocity shear , it is clear that it must have been there since before ( the currently active period of ) the radio source switched on .",
    "baum et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) classified low redshift radio galaxies on the basis of the kinematics of the emission line gas into `` rotators '' , which baum et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) associate with mergers , `` calm non - rotators '' , identified with cooling flows , and `` violent non - rotators '' , where any organized motion of the emission line gas is overshadowed by interaction with the agn .",
    "1243 + 036 shows the presence of two of the kinematical characteristics of the low redshift radio galaxies : a calm rotator in the region outside the radio source and a violent non - rotator in the inner parts .",
    "thus , we may in 1243 + 036 be witnessing an important stage in the evolution of massive galaxies in the early universe . the scenario would be that a large scale rotating gas disk or outflowing gas is ionized by the strong continuum emission from the agn , while the interaction of the radio source with the gas causes large velocities removing signs of the earlier calm kinematics as the radio lobes propagate outwards . in the outer halo , where the gas is still unaffected by the radio plasma ,",
    "the rotating gas disk is still intact .",
    "we note that in other high redshift radio galaxies a strong extended hi absorption feature against the ly@xmath2 is frequently observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "these absorption features have velocity widths of a few hundred kilometers per second and absorb a part of the emission line profile over the entire ly@xmath2 spatial extent along the radio axis .",
    "they may be caused by high column density ( @xmath151 cm @xmath68 ) hi absorption systems with a doppler parameter @xmath152 km s@xmath5 ) or by a superposition of many lower column density clouds with an integrated velocity dispersion like that observed of these absorption features .",
    "if the latter explanation is the case , the similar velocity width of the strong absorption features observed in some hzrgs and of the ly@xmath2 emission from the outer halo in 1243 + 036 , suggests that these features may have a similar origin .",
    "finally we note that the low surface brightness of the ly@xmath2 emission from the outer halo of 1243 + 036 is of a similar level to that occasionally observed from the extended nebulosity around radio quiet quasars ( e.g. bremer et al .",
    "1992b ) and from some damped ly@xmath2 absorption systems ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "perhaps this represents the quiescent state of the gas around primeval galaxies in general , unaffected by interaction with radio plasma .",
    "several authors have discussed multiple hotspots and bending of the radio jet in quasars and radio galaxies ( e.g. van breugel et  al .",
    "1985 ; lonsdale & barthel 1986a , 1986b ; cox et  al . 1991 ; icke 1991 )",
    ". an important feature of the bending of the radio jet in 1243 + 036 is the coincidence of enhanced ly@xmath2 emission that is at a blueshifted velocity with respect to the rest of ly@xmath2 emitting gas , suggesting a direct interaction between the radio jet and the emission line gas .",
    "line emission at the position of a sudden bend in the radio jet is also seen at low redshift in 3c277.3 ( coma a ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider three possibilities for the bent radio structure in 1243 + 036 .",
    "\\(i ) _ jet deflection by a gas cloud . _",
    "lonsdale & barthel ( 1986 ) argue that the double hotspots often observed in powerful radio sources are due to deflection of the radio jets by a gas cloud .",
    "they find that a straight deflection by a dense wall of a massive cloud would be possible , but not very appealing , because very large cloud masses are required ( @xmath15310@xmath146 m@xmath116 ) .",
    "also , the jet would quickly eat into the wall so that the deflection direction would change more rapidly than the necessary time to build up the secondary hot spots .",
    "lonsdale & barthel ( 1986 ) find that the best possible method of deflection might be through a `` delaval '' nozzle ( e.g. blandford & rees 1974 ) .",
    "the jet eats into a cloud , where it inflates a plasma  bubble .",
    "the bubble breaks out at the weakest spot in the asymmetrically confining cloud , creating the `` delaval '' nozzle .",
    "this then produces collimated outflow that feeds the secondary hotspot .",
    "they claim that the cloud with bubble structure will have a long lifetime such that the deflection direction is maintained stationary over the time required to build up the secondary hotspots ( @xmath810@xmath154 years ) .",
    "the mass and density of the deflecting cloud must be sufficiently large such that it is not blown away past the secondary hot spot . from the total luminosity of 1243 + 036 , the average energy supply rate to the hot spots is unlikely to be larger than @xmath155 ergs s@xmath5 ( see table 3 ) . from this and the total minimum energy of component b4",
    ", we estimate that the time to build up component b4 is 10@xmath15610@xmath154 years ( see also lonsdale and barthel , 1986a ) .",
    "thus , the advance speed ( @xmath157 ) of hotspot b1 must be @xmath158 so that b1 does not pass the other hotspots within that time . from minimum energy density ( @xmath159 ) for b1 in the ram - pressure balance equation @xmath160",
    ", the density of the deflecting cloud must be @xmath161 cm@xmath113 ( see also table 4 ) , similar to what lonsdale and barthel ( 1986 ) derived .",
    "this @xmath162 cm@xmath113 density gas represents the hot halo as suggested earlier and is sufficient to provide the necessary time to build up the secondary hotspots . as this hot gas",
    "most likely uniformly surrounds the whole system it does not itself deflect the radio jet .",
    "it must be an overdensity of hot and cold gas , e.g. emission line gas , that deflects the radio jet .",
    "this whole region would then be accelerated by the interaction and we shall refer to it as the deflecting `` cloud '' . the deflecting cloud must be larger than the size of the total working area of the radio jet , i.e. the primary hotspot . the hotspot b1 is unresolved in our 8 ghz maps , i.e. smaller than 1.5 kpc .",
    "the size of primary hotspots in powerful radio sources is typically 1 kpc ( e.g. laing 1988b ) . assuming that the deflecting cloud has a diameter of @xmath84 kpc , similar to the determined for the enhanced ly@xmath2 emission region at b1 , and that it is spherical , the minimal density gives a total mass of @xmath115 m@xmath116 .",
    "the ly@xmath2 flux of the region of enhanced emission at the position of b1 indicates the presence of @xmath57 m@xmath116 of ionized gas ( see table 5 ) .",
    "if the emission line clouds have dense neutral cores then the total mass of gas ( neutral and ionized ) may be an order of magnitude higher .",
    "the ly@xmath2 image and high resolution spectroscopy show that the enhanced emission at the location of radio hotspot b1 has a velocity of @xmath97 km s@xmath5 with respect to the main ly@xmath2 gas . to determine whether the interaction with the radio jet could have accelerated the gas we have to estimate the jet power of 1243 + 036 .",
    "a rough estimate can be made from the total radio luminosity ( see table 3 ) and the conversion efficiency factor @xmath163 , l@xmath164 ( e.g. bridle & perley 1984 ) , where the efficiency is probably of order 0.10.01 . thus a jet power @xmath165 ergs s@xmath5 is a reasonable assumption .",
    "alternatively we can estimate the jet power , assuming that the total minimum energy of the radio components is replenished in the synchrotron lifetime , giving l@xmath166 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "a third estimate comes from the jet thrust of a relativistic jet ( not to be confused with the hot spot advance speed which is only @xmath167 ) , @xmath168=l@xmath169 ) ( @xcite ) , that can be determined from the minimum pressure and area of a hotspot . assuming a hotspot size of 1 kpc ( see above ) and jet parameters like in cygnus a , @xmath170 , @xmath171 ( e.g. perley et  al . 1984 )",
    ", we find l@xmath172x10@xmath173 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that the jet power of 1243 + 036 is @xmath165 ergs s@xmath5 . a gas mass of 10@xmath144 m@xmath116 with a velocity of 1100 km s@xmath5 has a kinetic energy of 1.2x10@xmath174 ergs .",
    "the jet can have accelerated this mass over a period of 10@xmath156 years , if the transfer efficiency of jet power to kinetic energy of the gas is @xmath81% . in this deflection scenario",
    "the pre - existing massive cloud that is hit by the radio jet does not necessarily have to be one kiloparsec - scale cloud , which given the densities of the emission line gas would be jeans unstable , but could consist of a region of small dense clouds or filaments and low density gas in between . if the clouds are optically thick they can contain large amounts of neutral gas .",
    "whatever bends the radio jet has to be a continuous surface over the working area of the radio jet .",
    "thus , if it is the emission line gas that deflects the radio jet , the clouds must have been turned into a `` mist '' .",
    "the interaction with the radio jet may rip apart dense neutral cloud cores forming a gaseous medium with an increased filling factor and covering fraction ( @xcite ) .",
    "this `` mist '' could be the medium in which the de laval nozzle forms by which the radio jet is delfected the larger filling factor will cause a larger fraction of the gas to be exposed to the ionizing radiation .",
    "this will enhance the lyman @xmath2 emission from the region .",
    "local shock ionization due to the impact of the jet may further enhance the ly@xmath2 emission . alternatively icke ( 1991 )",
    "showed that a jet can be bent smoothly by a pressure gradient and thus may bounce off a gas cloud . in the case of 1243 + 036",
    "the redirected jet would then have several emission knots due to weak shocks from further interactions with the emission line gas .",
    "although this might account for the observed radio structure of 1243 + 036 and the acceleration of emission line gas at b1 , it is not clear if this mechanism would also cause the enhanced ly@xmath2 emission from the deflecting cloud .",
    "\\(ii ) _ precessing radio jet . _ an alternative explanation for the bent radio structure with multiple hotspots might be precession of the radio jet .",
    "the direction of the southern jet and the slight northern extension of radio lobe a give the radio source an overall z  shape , suggesting that the jet may be rotating .",
    "as the tip of the jet moves over the wall of the radio lobe it would create new hotspots , as in the `` dentist s drill '' model of scheuer ( 1982 )",
    ". the spectral steepening towards the outer parts of the radio structure could be the result of synchrotron aging in older hot spots .",
    "but it could also result from there being weaker shocks with distance along the jet in the deflected flow model .",
    "our crude estimate of the synchrotron age of hotspot b4 of 10,000 years ( see table 3 ) indicates that if the multiple hotspots are due to the directional change of the radio jet , for b4 still to be visible when b1 is being formed , the jet precession speed would be 0.001@xmath26 yr@xmath5 and the jet would have revolved 27 times within the age of the radio source ( @xmath810@xmath143 yr ) .",
    "the projected velocity of the jet impact site from b4 to b1 ( 10 kpc ) would be @xmath175 . at these precession speeds",
    "we would not expect the jet to be straight from the core - jet component to b1 ( and a1 ) and a straight line of hotspots from b1 to b4 , but a more gradually bent s  shape structure .",
    "also at this precession speed the time that the jet feeds the area of one hotspot is a factor 1001000 shorter than the time required to build up the hotspot ( see above ) . nor",
    "would it have time to accelerate the emission line gas at b1 to its observed velocity .",
    "even if we have underestimated the age of b4 by a factor of 10 , the inferred speeds seem implausibly high .",
    "thus we regard the idea of a precessing jet causing the bent radio structure and multiple hotspots as very unlikely .",
    "also the magnetic field projecting along the southern jet ( fig .",
    "7 ) is consistent with flux freezing and shear flow along the jet ( @xcite ) , and hence supports the idea of a deflected flow model .",
    "we see the bent radio structure projected on the plane of the sky . however , the bending of the southern jet may have taken place partly into the direction of the line of sight .",
    "if the jet is still moving relativistically after the deflection , doppler boosting may increase the observed flux of weak radio knots along the jet . in the light of the orientation unification scheme for radio galaxies and quasars , 1243 + 036",
    "would be oriented close to the plane of the sky .",
    "if the bending of the jet towards us is as much as it is projected on the plane of the sky ( @xmath176 degrees ) , the southern jet could have been deflected to as close as @xmath830 degrees from our line of sight . for a relativistically moving jet ( @xmath177 a few )",
    "the observed flux could have been doppler boosted by a factor @xmath8315 relative to its original direction .",
    "the synchrotron emission associated with weak shocks in the deflected southern jet may have been enhanced forming the observed knots b2 , b3 and b4 .",
    "\\(iii ) _ sweeping of the radio jet by the ambient gas . _ as a third possibility , the sudden bend and overall z  shape of the radio source may be due to `` sweeping '' of the radio jet by the ambient medium after the jet has been slowed down in the hotspots b1 and a1 .",
    "such a mechanism has also been invoked to explain the linear radio features in some seyferts and the z  shape of the low redshift radio galaxy 3c293 ( @xcite ) where the radio jets are propagating through a rotating gaseous disk .",
    "1243 + 036 shows both morphological and kinematical similarities to 3c293 and 3c305 ( @xcite ) where there is evidence for rotation and the radio morphology is z  shaped . at high redshifts not only 1243 + 036 , but also 4c41.17 exhibits a radio morphology where the axis defined by the outermost radio components is rotated with respect to the axis defined by the inner components .",
    "these morphologies suggest that large scale motion of the ambient medium may have deformed the outer parts of the radio source .",
    "the possible rotating gaseous disk of the outer halo in 1243 + 036 indicates that large scale organized motion is present that may provide the transverse ram pressure ( sweeping effect ) that is required to bend the radio source to its observed morphology .",
    "the velocity shear of the outer halo is consistent with solid - body rotation that , if it is sweeping the radio plasma , would indeed cause the straight radio structure of the `` southern jet '' in 1243 + 036 . scaling the calculations of van breugel et  al .",
    "( 1984 ) for 3c293 to the much larger jet kinetic energy of 1243 + 036 ( derived above ) , requires an average density @xmath178 cm@xmath113 , where @xmath163 is the efficiency of order 0.10.01 as mentioned above , to bend the jet over a distance comparable to the jet diameter .",
    "thus , the jet must have lost more than 99.9% of its kinetic energy in the hotspot b1 ( and a1 ) , and continue onwards as a light , but still fast jet ( @xmath179 km s@xmath5 , see van breugel et  al .",
    "1984 ) , to be bent by the ( @xmath126 cm@xmath113 ) rotating gas of the outer halo .",
    "although we can not exclude this possibility , it seems more plausible that , with a strong interaction at b1 , the jet would be deflected along the lines of scenario ( i ) than that it would continue at high velocity , but with much less thrust , in the same direction .",
    "thus , the bending of the radio structure in 1243 + 036 coinciding with accelerated emission line gas is evidence that the radio jet is deflected by the interaction of the jet with the emission line gas .",
    "this supports the idea of barthel & miley ( 1988 ) that the frequent distortions of radio structures of quasars and radio galaxies at high redshifts are caused by interaction of the radio jet with gas clouds in the environment .",
    "the @xmath1-band continuum morphology of 1243 + 036 is clearly aligned with the principal radio axis , the line connecting components a , n and b1 .",
    "this alignment of @xmath1-band continuum emission with the radio axis is a commonly observed feature in high redshift radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to this , 1243 + 036 also has a low surface brightness continuum component ( see fig .  8) , which has the same narrow alignment with the principal radio axis and apparently extends beyond the radio lobes .",
    "if this faint extended continuum emission is real , this can have important implications for the interpretation of the alignment effect in high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "one of the first proposed explanations for the `` alignment effect '' was jet induced star formation ( @xcite ) where shocks from the radio jet and the overpressured radio lobes would lead to star formation in dense clouds along the direction of the jet propagation .",
    "daly ( 1992 ) argues that inverse compton scattering of cmb photons of the relativistic electrons in the radio plasma could cause the alignment effect at high redshifts .",
    "optical polarization measurements of intermediate and high redshift radio galaxies have indicated that much of the aligned continuum light is polarized , therefore some or all of the light is scattered light from a hidden quasar by dust or hot electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that , although jet induced star formation may play a role , scattering processes are important contributors to the alignment effect . in 1243 + 036",
    "we see that the aligned continuum does not follow the radio structure that bends at the position of radio knot b1 into the `` southern jet '' .",
    "instead the optical continuum extends further outwards with the same orientation as the inner continuum , the ly@xmath2 `` cone '' and the principal radio axis .",
    "this argues against a direct relation between the optical continuum morphology and the radio jet as required by inverse compton models and jet - induced star formation and suggests that the optical continuum orientation is linked to the axis of the agn .",
    "however , in the jet - induced star formation scenario , the extended continuum may be a relic of star formation of along a previous path of the jet , when possibly no bending occurred .",
    "thus , the presence of faint extended optical continuum beyond the radio structure maintaining its alignment with the inner radio structure and the brightest ly@xmath2 gas favours the scenario of scattering of anisotropically emitted nuclear continuum light , although it is possible that jet induced star formation played a role at an earlier evolutionary stage of the radio source and currently in the inner parts of the radio galaxy . a much deeper image is needed to confirm the reality of the faint extended continuum emission .",
    "we have found and studied the distant radio galaxy 1243 + 036 at @xmath0 .",
    "it has spectacular properties both in the optical and in the radio : 1 .",
    "the radio source extends over 55 kpc , has a sudden bend and multiple hotspot structure .",
    "all components have ultra steep spectra and the radio emission is strongly depolarized .",
    "2 . the radio galaxy has strong and extended ly@xmath2 and o[iii ] emission .",
    "the ly@xmath2 emission is aligned with the radio source and shows a clumpy structure .",
    "it is characterized by three components : ( i ) the inner halo inside the radio structure with a large velocity dispersion , ( ii ) enhanced emission with blueshifted velocity at the position of the bend in the radio structure and ( iii ) a quiescent outer halo with a velocity shear of 450 km s@xmath5 extending over a total diameter of at least 135 kpc , aligned with the inner optical and radio axis .",
    "the @xmath1 band continuum is aligned with the principal radio axis and shows a faint extension slightly beyond the radio structure .",
    "this emission does not have a sharp bend like the radio emission but stays aligned with the inner continuum , the emission line gas and the principal radio axis .",
    "we have argued that the observations have the following implications : a ) the quiescent outer ly@xmath2 halo must predate the onset of the radio source .",
    "the origin of this gas and its kinematics is probably due to the accretion of gas from the environment producing a large scale rotation , although there is a possibility that it is caused by a massive outflow from the central galaxy .",
    "b ) the interaction of the radio jet with the emission line gas is responsible for the bent radio structure .",
    "the jet has accelerated the gas at the interaction to a velocity of 1100 km s@xmath5 relative to the rest of the system and may have shred the emission line clouds , locally enhancing the ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "the bending of the radio structure in 1243 + 036 coinciding with accelerated emission line gas is evidence that gas clouds may be the general cause of bending in high redshifts radio sources .",
    "c ) the large velocity dispersion of the emission line gas inside the radio structure and the low dispersion of the gas outside of it , support the idea that the large velocity dispersions of the emission line gas in hzrgs is caused by entrainment of gas by the radio jet or shocks and turbulence in the radio plasma .",
    "d ) the close alignment of the principal radio axis with the inner ly@xmath2 gas and especially with the ly@xmath2 from the outer halo argues for photoionization by anisotropically emitted radiation from the agn .",
    "e ) the extended ly@xmath2 emission suggests densities of the emission line filaments of order a few to 100 cm@xmath113 .",
    "the required confinement of the emission line gas and the radio hotspots along with strong depolarization of the radio emission argue for the presence of a dense ( 0.1 cm@xmath113 ) hot ( @xmath54 k ) halo surrounding the system .",
    "f ) the extension of the aligned optical continuum emission beyond the radio structure and not following the bending of the radio source is an argument against inverse compton scattering and jet - induced starformation for the alignment - effect in this object .",
    "it favours scattering of anisotropic nuclear continuum radiation .",
    "the most likely scenario for explaining our observations is that a large rotating gaseous disk , originating from accretion associated with the formation of the galaxy , is ionized by anisotropically emitted continuum emission from the agn .",
    "the interaction of the radio source with the gas bends the radio jet and causes large velocities in the ly@xmath2 halo as the radio plasma propagates outwards . in the outer halo",
    "the gas is still unaffected by the radio plasma and the quiescently rotating gas disk is still intact .",
    "because of its large luminosity and spatial extent , 1243 + 036 provides an important laboratory for investigating the intrinsic nature of high reshift radio sources and the conditions in the early universe .",
    "further observations of this object are underway using ground based telescopes and the hubble space telescope .",

    "<S> . the ordered motion may be large - scale rotation caused by the accretion of gas from the environment of the radio galaxy or by a merger . </S>",
    "<S> although alternatively the halo may be caused by a massive outflow , we argue that bulk inflow of the emission line gas is inconsistent with the most likely orientation of the radio source .    </S>",
    "<S> the large velocity - width of the ly@xmath2 gas contained within the radio source compared to that of the outer halo suggest a direct interaction of the radio source with the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial correlation of enhanced , blue - shifted ly@xmath2 emission and the sharp bend of the radio structure suggest that the emission line gas could have deflected the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the jet could have accelerated the gas at this position and may have locally enhanced the ly@xmath2 emission .    extended faint optical continuum emission is aligned with the principal radio axis , a phenomenon commonly observed in high redshift radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this emission it does not follow the bending of the radio jet , indicating that , at least in 1243 + 036 , models invoking scattering of continuum radiation from the agn as the cause of this alignment are favoured . </S>"
