    "our present understanding of the strong interaction is based on a non - abelian gauge field theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the interactions of quarks and gluons ; it also predicts the existence of new types of hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom ( eg .",
    "glueballs , hybrids and multi - quarks )  @xcite .",
    "these unconventional states , if they exist , will enrich the meson spectroscopy greatly and shed light on the dynamics of qcd . according to lattice qcd predictions  @xcite ,",
    "the lowest mass glueball with @xmath11 is in the mass region from @xmath12 to @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "however , the mixing of the pure glueball with nearby @xmath15 nonet mesons makes the identification of the glueballs difficult in both experiment and theory .",
    "radiative @xmath1 decay is a gluon - rich process and has long been regarded as one of the most promising hunting grounds for glueballs . in particular , for a @xmath1 radiative decay to two pseudoscalar mesons , it offers a very clean laboratory to search for scalar and tensor glueballs because only intermediate states with @xmath16 are possible .",
    "an early study of @xmath17 was made by the crystal ball collaboration  @xcite with the first observation of @xmath5 , but the study suffered from low statistics .    in this paper , the results of partial wave analysis ( pwa ) on @xmath2 are presented based on a sample of @xmath0 @xmath1 events  @xcite collected with the beijing spectrometer ( besiii ) located at the upgraded beijing electron and positron collider ( bepcii )  @xcite .",
    "the besiii detector , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , has an effective geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4@xmath18 .",
    "it contains a small cell helium - based main drift chamber ( mdc ) which provides momentum measurements of charged particles ; a time - of - flight system ( tof ) based on plastic scintillator which helps to identify charged particles ; an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) made of csi ( tl ) crystals which is used to measure the energies of photons and provide trigger signals ; and a muon system ( muc ) made of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) .",
    "the momentum resolution of charged particles is @xmath19% at 1  gev@xmath20 in a 1  tesla magnetic field . the energy loss ( @xmath21 ) measurement provided by the mdc has a resolution better than 6% for electrons from bhabha scattering",
    ". the photon energy resolution can reach @xmath22% ( @xmath23% ) at 1.0  gev in the barrel ( endcaps ) of the emc .",
    "and the time resolution of tof is @xmath24  ps in the barrel and @xmath25  ps in the endcaps .",
    "monte carlo  ( mc ) simulated events are used to determine the detection efficiency , optimize the selection criteria , and study the possible backgrounds .",
    "the simulation of the besiii detector , where the interactions of the particles with the detector material are simulated , is geant4  @xcite based . the @xmath1 resonance is produced with kkmc  @xcite , while the subsequent decays are generated with evtgen  @xcite .",
    "the study of the background is based on a mc sample of @xmath26 @xmath1 inclusive decays which are generated with known branching fractions taken from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , or with lundcharm  @xcite for the unmeasured decays .",
    "in this analysis , the @xmath27 meson is detected in its @xmath28 decay .",
    "each candidate event is required to have five or six good photons and no charged tracks .",
    "the photon candidates are selected from the showers in the emc with deposited energy in the emc barrel region ( @xmath29 ) and emc endcap region ( @xmath30 ) greater than 25  mev and 50  mev , respectively .",
    "the energy deposit in nearby tof counters is included to improve the reconstruction efficiency and energy resolution .    to suppress the background events with @xmath31 ( eg .",
    "@xmath32 ) , the events that satisfy @xmath33  gev/@xmath34 are removed , where @xmath35 is the invariant mass of any pair of photon candidates and @xmath36 is the nominal @xmath31 mass  @xcite .",
    "then a four - constraint kinematic fit ( 4c ) , imposing energy - momentum conservation , is performed under the @xmath37 hypothesis to reduce background events and improve the mass resolution , and @xmath38 is required to be less than 50 . if the number of selected photons is larger than five , the fit is repeated using all permutation of the photons , and the combination with the smallest @xmath38 is selected .    to distinguish the photons from @xmath27",
    "decays , a variable @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 , is introduced , and the combination with the minimum value of @xmath39 is chosen . the scatter plot of the invariant mass of one @xmath27 candidate versus the other is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : data ]  ( a ) , where the decay @xmath2 is clear . in order to select a clean sample , both @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "are required to be in the @xmath27 mass region , @xmath43  gev/@xmath14 , with @xmath44 the nominal @xmath27 mass  @xcite .",
    "the mass resolution for @xmath44 is about 10  mev/@xmath34 .",
    "mc study shows that after the above selection , about 5.3% of events have a mis - combination of photons , which mainly occurs between the radiative photon and one photon from an @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , candidate event must have only one combination with @xmath45 gev/@xmath14 to remove these events , which reduces the fraction of events with a mis - combination of photons to be 0.8% .",
    "after that , clear diagonal bands , which correspond to the structures observed in the @xmath46 invariant mass spectrum , can be seen in the dalitz plot for the selected @xmath2 candidate events ( fig .",

    "is used to reject background events from @xmath49 ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : data ]  ( c ) shows the @xmath50 invariant mass spectrum of the surviving 5460 events after the event selection .",
    "-0.1 cm    -0.5 cm    potential background events have been studied using both mc and data samples .",
    "the non-@xmath27 events are determined from the two dimensional @xmath27 mass - sidebands , 0.07  gev/@xmath51 0.15  gev/@xmath34 , which are defined as frame a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ]  ( a ) .",
    "the shaded histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ]  ( c ) shows the sideband events normalized according to @xmath37 phase space mc .",
    "in addition , the background events are studied with a mc sample of 225 million @xmath1 inclusive events , and the main background events are found to be from @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this paper , the background events estimated from @xmath27 mass - sidebands , corresponding to a background level of 6% , are used in the partial wave analysis below .",
    "with gpupwa , a partial wave analysis framework harnessing gpu parallel computing  @xcite , a pwa was performed to disentangle the structures present in @xmath2 decays .",
    "the quasi two - body decay amplitudes in the sequential decay process @xmath54 are constructed using covariant tensor amplitudes described in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath1 radiative decay to mesons ,",
    "the general form for covariant tensor amplitude is : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath1 polarization four - vector , @xmath57 is the polarization vector of the photon and @xmath58 is the partial wave amplitude with coupling strength determined by a complex parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes @xmath60 for the intermediate states used in the analysis are constructed with the four - momenta of daughter particles , and their specific expressions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for an intermediate resonance ,",
    "the corresponding breit - wigner propagator is described by a function : @xmath61 where s is the invariant mass - squared of daughter particles , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mass and width of the intermediate resonance .",
    "the relative magnitudes and phases of the amplitudes are determined by an unbinned maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the resonance parameters are optimized by the scan method : repeating the fits iteratively with various masses and widths until the optimized likelihood values converge . for the tensor states ,",
    "the relative phases between three amplitudes for a certain resonance are theoretically expected to be very small  @xcite ; therefore the relative phases are set to zero in the fit so as to constrain the intensities further .",
    "the basis of the likelihood fitting is that a hypothesized probability density function ( pdf ) would produce the data set under consideration .",
    "the probability to observe the event characterized by the measurement @xmath64 is : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the detection efficiency and @xmath67 is the differential cross section , and @xmath68 is the standard element of phase space .",
    "the full differential cross section is : @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the full amplitude for all resonances whose spin - parity are @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the contribution of the sequential decay processes such as @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is the measured total cross section .",
    "the joint probability density for observing the @xmath75 events in the data sample is : @xmath76    for the technical reasons , rather than maximizing @xmath77 , @xmath78=-@xmath79 is minimized , i.e. , @xmath80 for a given data set , the second term is a constant and has no impact on the determination of the parameters of the amplitudes or on the relative changes of @xmath78 values .",
    "so , for the fitting , @xmath79 defined as : @xmath81 is used .",
    "the free parameters are optimized by fumili  @xcite .",
    "the measured total cross section @xmath82 is evaluated using mc techniques .",
    "namely , a mc sample of @xmath83 is generated with signal events that are distributed uniformly in phase space .",
    "these events are subjected to our selection criteria and yield a sample of @xmath84 accepted events .",
    "the normalization integral is computed as : @xmath85    the background contribution is estimated with @xmath27 sidebands . in the log likelihood calculation , the likelihood value of @xmath27 sidebands events are given negative weights , and are removed from data since the log likelihood value of data is the sum of the log likelihood values of signal and background events , i.e. , @xmath86    the number of the fitted events @xmath87 for an intermediate resonance x , which has @xmath88 independent partial wave amplitudes @xmath89 , is defined as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of selected events after background subtraction , and @xmath92 is the measured cross section of the resonance x and is calculated with the same mc sample as the measured total cross section @xmath82 .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath93 is calculated with : @xmath94 where the detection efficiency @xmath95 is obtained by the partial wave amplitude weighted mc sample , @xmath96    the statistical errors for masses , widths and branching ratios in a pwa are defined as one standard deviation from the optimized results , which corresponds to a change , 0.5 , of the log likelihood value for a specific parameter . in this analysis , the changes of log likelihood value and the number of free parameters in the fit with or without a resonance are used to evaluate the statistical significance of this resonance .      in this analysis , all possible combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath97 resonances listed in the pdg summary table  @xcite are evaluated , and the fitted components with statistical significance larger than 5.0@xmath98 are kept as the basic solution . the contribution from @xmath97 ( @xmath99 ) with a statistical significance of 0.4@xmath98",
    "is ignored .",

    "although most of the @xmath106 events have been rejected by the above @xmath107 mass window requirement , @xmath106 is included in the pwa to evaluate its impact from the interference between the tail of @xmath107 and other components from @xmath108 .",

    "the scalar contributions are mainly from @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , while no evident contributions from @xmath109 and @xmath110 are seen .",
    "recently , the production rate of the pure gauge scalar glueball in @xmath1 radiative decays predicted by the lattice qcd  @xcite was found to be compatible with the production rate of @xmath1 radiative decays to @xmath101 ; this suggests that @xmath101 has a larger overlap with the glueball compared to other glueball candidates ( eg .",
    "@xmath100 ) . in this analysis ,",
    "the production rate of @xmath101 and @xmath102 are both about one order of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath100 and no clear evidence is found for @xmath109 , which are both consistent with , at least not contrary to , lattice qcd predictions .",
    "studies using data from @xmath111 annihilation  @xcite show that the @xmath102 has strong coupling to @xmath50 , but much weaker to @xmath112 , which indicates an exotic @xmath102 decay pattern .",

    "is shown as a clear peak in the @xmath50 mass spectrum ; a tensor component exists in the mass region from 1.8  gev/@xmath14 to 2  gev/@xmath14 , although we can not distinguish @xmath104 from @xmath113 or @xmath114 ; and the pwa requires a strong contribution from @xmath10 , although the possibility of @xmath115 can not be ruled out . for the narrow @xmath116",
