    "the dependence is similar to that observed for the reaction @xmath271 and for the elastic photoproduction of the j/@xmath258 and is in qualitative agreement with the strong energy dependence expected from pqcd calculations  @xcite which relate these cross sections to the rise in the gluon momentum density in the proton at small @xmath9 .",
    "a steep @xmath5 dependence is also observed in inclusive dis diffractive scattering  @xcite and in the @xmath272 total cross section@xcite .",
