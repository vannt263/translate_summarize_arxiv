    "<S> we observed an enhanced saturation magnetization @xmath0 for ultrathin nife~2~o~4~ films on nb - srtio~3~ ( 001 ) substrates that co - occurs with a reduced out - of - plane lattice constant under compressive in - plane epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> we found a bulk - like cationic coordination of the inverse spinel lattice independent of the nife~2~o~4~ film thickness  thus ruling out a cationic inversion that nominally could account for an enhanced @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our study instead uncovers a reduction of the unit cell volume , i.e. an auxetic behavior in ultrathin nife~2~o~4~ films , which may result in an enhanced magnetic exchange caused by an increased interatomic electronic localization . </S>"
