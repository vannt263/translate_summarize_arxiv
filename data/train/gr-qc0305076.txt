    "one of the most celebrated results of the theory of relativity is the one known as the sagnac effect @xcite , which appears when two photons describe , in opposite directions , a closed path on a rotating disk returning to the starting point .",
    "physically , the sagnac effect is essentially a phase shift between two coherent beams of light travelling along paths in opposite senses in an interferometer placed on a rigidly rotating platform @xcite .",
    "this phase shift can be explained as a consequence of a time delay , so the sagnac effect can also be measured with atomic clocks timing light rays sent , e.g. , around the rotating earth via the satellites of the global positioning system @xcite . from a geometrical approach , such phase shift has also been related @xcite to the fact that the time component of the anholonomity object , corresponding to the choice of an orthonormal frame on the space - time , is different from zero .",
    "the sagnac effect outlines the problem of the isotropy of the velocity of light with respect to a non - inertial observer fixed on the rotating disk .",
    "this problem has been treated from different points of view . in @xcite , it is pointed out that the sagnac time delay , measured by one single clock , is due to an anisotropy in the global speed of light for the non - inertial observer , in contradiction with the local einstein synchronization convention .",
    "another approach is found in @xcite .",
    "there , the speed of light in opposite directions is the same , both locally and globally .",
    "the proof is performed using three clocks located at the initial and final positions of the two photons , and by extrapolating point to point , the local einstein synchronization procedure to the whole periphery of the disk .",
    "the disagreements between both approaches are connected with the problem of the global time synchronization of points on the periphery of a rotating disk .",
    "only if this global synchronization were possible there would exist a well defined spatial length between different points on the boundary of the rotating disk .",
    "in this paper we consider an ideal rotating disk with negligible gravitational effects , thus the effects due to gravitational fields that require the application of general relativistic techniques as those in @xcite or @xcite , where exact and post - minkowskian solutions are used are not considered here .",
    "we will also show the isotropy of the velocity of light measured in a rotating frame in the minkowski space - time .",
    "we verify that this isotropy is compatible with the sagnac effect . for this",
    "we take into account that every kinematical problem in special relativity can always be translated into a geometrical problem on space - time .",
    "note on this respect that some authors have need to introduce some dynamical explanations for explaining the rotating disk problem @xcite .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we give a brief account of the technique used by rizzi and tartaglia @xcite and describe how the use of the _ hypothesis of locality _ , ( see @xcite ) offers an explanation of the sagnac effect in the framework of special relativity , without using the anisotropy of a global speed of light . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we solve this problem in terms of the world - function associated to the geodesic determined by the world - lines of the observer and the photon and the simultaneity space corresponding to the observer . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] a formulation of the problem using the solution of geodesic triangles is obtained . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] a relationship between the problem stated on a minkowskian cylinder and on a minkowskian plane is obtained .",
    "let @xmath0 be a disk of radius @xmath1 , and let us denote by @xmath2 the circle bounding @xmath3 .",
    "we consider an inertial reference frame @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the center of @xmath3 and @xmath6 is an orthonormal basis for the euclidean space @xmath7 . in the coordinate system @xmath8 associated to @xmath9 ,",
    "the points in @xmath3 have coordinate @xmath10 equal to zero .",
    "it will also be useful to consider polar coordinates @xmath11 on @xmath3 .",
    "now we assume that the disk @xmath3 is uniformly rotating about the @xmath5 axis , with angular velocity @xmath12 . in the space - time @xmath13 of special relativity in minkowski",
    "coordinates , with @xmath14 , the motion of the points @xmath15 with polar coordinates @xmath16 , is given by world - lines @xmath17 , that in coordinates @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 this congruence of time - like curves determines a cylinder @xmath20 .",
    "on the cylinder @xmath21 both a metric @xmath22 is induced by the metric @xmath23 , which in comoving coordinates @xmath16 , reads @xmath24 where @xmath25    and a killing vector field @xmath26 given by a combination of a rotation and a time translation , that , at each point @xmath27 , is @xmath28 , are defined .",
    "the associated killing congruence has non null vorticity within the cylinder but is zero outside it .",
    "so , the vorticity and the 4-velocity play an analogous role to the magnetic field and the 4-electromagnetic potential , respectively , of the aharonov - bohm effect in electrodynamics , @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ 4 ] ) is globally stationary and locally static ; therefore a _",
    "local _ splitting of @xmath21 can be obtained using local hypersurfaces locally orthogonal to the trajectory of the rotating observer , as in @xcite .",
    "global _ operational quotient space by the killing congruence can be build , by using the radar distance as a spatial distance @xcite .    in general , for every two points @xmath29 , joined by a geodesic @xmath30 , being @xmath31 a special parameter with @xmath32 , there is a function @xmath33 the world function in synge s terminology , @xcite defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the tangent vector to the geodesic @xmath30 .",
    "let us now consider , at the time @xmath36 , a point @xmath37 and the world - line @xmath38 corresponding to a curve in the congruence ( [ 1 ] ) , with @xmath39 .",
    "on @xmath38 one may build a field of non - inertial reference frames @xmath40 . the proper time interval between two events",
    "@xmath41 with coordinate times @xmath42 and @xmath43 measured by the observer @xmath44 is given in terms of the world - function ( [ 2803031 ] ) as @xmath45    suppose that the rotating observer fixed on the circle @xmath46 carries a device which emits , at the time @xmath47 , two photons in opposite directions along the periphery of the disk .",
    "the world - lines of both photons are null helices .",
    "their equations in the inertial reference frame @xmath9 read @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the angular speeds of the photons given by @xmath50 , being the plus ( resp .",
    "minus ) sign associated to the photon moving in the same ( resp .",
    "opposite ) sense as the rotating disk .    at the initial time @xmath51",
    "it is assumed that @xmath52 .",
    "the world - line corresponding to each photon cuts the curve @xmath53 at times @xmath54 , for which it is satisfied the condition @xmath55 .",
    "therefore one obtains @xmath56    the relationship between proper time on @xmath53 and the inertial coordinate time given in ( [ 135 ] ) establishes that the proper time in @xmath44 runs slow with respect to an inertial one .",
    "hence , using ( [ time ] ) one obtains @xmath57 the proper time increment measured by the observer @xmath44 among the arrival times of the two photons @xmath58 and @xmath59 is ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath60 that , in the limit of small rotational speeds , takes the classical form given in @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the disk area .",
    "the sagnac time delay is the desynchronization of a pair of clocks after a complete round trip , which has been initially synchronized and sent by the rotating observer to travel in opposite directions , @xcite . in this case , the time differences along a complete round trip on the periphery @xmath63 of the disk , are not uniquely defined and the measurement of each one must be corrected by half the sagnac time delay when compared with an identical clock remaining fixed at the initial position . after this correction is made , the global light speed is the same for the photon moving on @xmath46 in opposite sense .",
    "this is in fact what is done in the global positioning system , @xcite .",
    "note , on the other hand , that if the readings of both clocks are not corrected by half the sagnac time ( [ 9 ] ) , one obtains an anisotropic velocity of light , as in @xcite .",
    "let us assume that at the time @xmath47 , in the inertial reference frame @xmath9 , a non - inertial observer @xmath44 at a fixed point @xmath64 emits a pulse of light in the same direction of the movement of the disk .",
    "the event @xmath65 corresponds in the cylinder @xmath21 to the point with cylindrical coordinates @xmath66 .",
    "we now determine the relative speed of the ray of light with respect to the non - inertial frame @xmath44 .",
    "the world - lines for the observer and the photon can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates , in the form @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the curve @xmath38 is the time - like helix corresponding to a non - inertial observer fixed at the point @xmath68 on the disk .",
    "the curve @xmath69 describes the null helix of the photon co - rotating with the disk .    on the world - line @xmath53",
    "one can determine a vector field @xmath70 such that the orthogonality condition , @xmath71 , is satisfied .",
    "for each point @xmath72 on @xmath53 , one builds a space - like geodesic @xmath73 on the cylinder @xmath74 , corresponding to the initial data @xmath75 @xmath76 the geodesic @xmath73 can be interpreted as the locus of locally simultaneous events on an arc of the circle @xmath77 as seen by the rotating observer . for the construction of the simultaneity space @xmath73 ,",
    "the hypothesis of locality given in @xcite is used , which establishes the local equivalence of an accelerated frame and a local inertial frame with the same local speed . in this way",
    ", a slicing of the cylinder @xmath21 through a family of sections @xmath73 orthogonal to the congruence of curves @xmath78 is obtained .",
    "when the rotating frame reaches the point @xmath79 in the curve @xmath53 , the world - function @xmath80 is the square of the proper time ( up to a constant factor ) between the events @xmath65 and @xmath81 of space - time , measured by the non - inertial observer . at the time @xmath42 the photon lies on the point @xmath82 of the local simultaneity space relative to the non - inertial rotating observer . since both the non - inertial observer and the photon move on @xmath83 , the corresponding points in space - time remain on the minkowskian cylinder @xmath21 .",
    "consider the point @xmath82 given by the intersection of the curves @xmath73 and @xmath84 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath85    using the metric ( [ 4 ] ) , the world - function corresponding to the pairs of points @xmath86 and @xmath87 , calculated along the curves @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are @xmath90 respectively .",
    "therefore , taking into account ( [ 135 ] ) , the relative speed of the photon with respect to the non - inertial frame defined by @xmath91 coincides with @xmath92 .",
    "result ( [ 14 ] ) can be compared with that obtained by using the solution of geodesic triangles on the semi - riemannian manifold @xmath93 for this we consider a geodesic triangle @xmath94 on a 2-manifold @xmath93 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for arbitrary points @xmath95 and @xmath96 ,",
    "let @xmath97 denote the covariant derivative of ( [ 2803031 ] ) with respect to the coordinates of @xmath95 , and denote by @xmath98 the vector associated to @xmath97 by means of the metric @xmath22 .",
    "let us assume that the riemannian curvature of a surface @xmath99 is small and we will use the same notation as in @xcite , chapter ii . if @xmath100 is an orthonormal basis on @xmath101 , one can build a field of reference frames on @xmath21 by parallel transport of this frame along all geodesics @xmath102 through @xmath65 . on the field",
    "@xmath103 , the vector field @xmath104 , tangent to one of these geodesics on an arbitrary point , has constant components @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "the components of the symmetrized riemann tensor @xmath106 will be denoted by @xmath107 .    for the geodesic triangle determined by the curves @xmath108",
    ", @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( with @xmath111 , v\\in [ 0,\\bar{v}]$ ] , see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) a relationship between the world - functions of the sides of this triangle is obtained in @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 denotes the covariant derivative of fourth order of the world - function @xmath115 for an arbitrary @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "an explicit approximate expression for @xmath117 appears in @xcite p. 73",
    ", written in terms of the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives .",
    "an application of this solution to build fermi coordinates in general space - times of small curvature is given in @xcite . in general it is satisfied that @xmath118\\ , du\\ , dv,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the polynomial @xmath120 and symbol @xmath121 $ ] , defined as @xmath122:=-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{3}}s_{(a_1b_1c_2d_2)}v^{(a_1 ) }      v^{(b_1)}v^{(c_2)}v^{(d_2)},\\ ] ] is constant on @xmath99 , so that @xmath123 vanishes . in ( [ 3103033 ] ) @xmath124 are the components of @xmath125 at points @xmath126 respectively . in the problem considered in this work , the metric ( [ 4 ] ) is uniform on the cylinder @xmath21 , and the riemannian curvature is zero , therefore expression ( [ 2803032 ] ) vanish .",
    "therefore , one obtains for the solution of the same triangle in the point @xmath81 @xmath127 where the covariant derivatives are calculated now at the point @xmath81 .",
    "now , since the geodesic @xmath128 is null and the geodesics @xmath129 and @xmath130 are orthogonal in @xmath81 ; then , from ( [ 5000 ] ) one obtains @xmath131 consequently , the ratio @xmath132 coincides with ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will see that the rotating observer on the disk has a specific characteristic which other different non - inertial observers do not have in general . in the first place , it is observed that expression ( [ 135 ] ) , which relates the proper time @xmath133 of a non - inertial observer fixed on the rotating disk ( moving with constant angular speed @xmath12 , such that @xmath134 ) to the coordinate time @xmath135 , coincides with the expression relating the inertial observer s time to the time of another inertial reference frame boosted with rectilinear speed @xmath136 .",
    "then one concludes that only by measuring proper time , a rotating observer will not be able to determine the local inertial or non - inertial character of the frame rotating uniformly on the disk .",
    "the only magnitude that he will be able to measure in that case is the speed modulus @xmath136 .",
    "now , let us consider a boosted rectilinear inertial frame @xmath137 . to measure the speed of a photon moving in the same direction as @xmath137 with respect to this frame we consider the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "here @xmath138 represents the straight line described by the observer ( we are assuming that the speed is @xmath139 ) in a minkowskian plane @xmath140 . on the other hand ,",
    "the null straight line @xmath141 represents the trajectory that one photon describes , and , finally , the line @xmath142 is the space - like straight line of simultaneous events to the emission event of the photon .",
    "this line is everywhere @xmath143orthogonal to the observer line at the event @xmath144 .",
    "explicitly , taking @xmath145 , these curves are given by @xmath146 where now @xmath147 .",
    "this can be verified directly from figure 2",
    ".    moreover , point @xmath148 at which @xmath142 cuts to @xmath141 has the coordinates @xmath149 therefore , keeping in mind again that @xmath150 , one obtains that the distances between @xmath151 and @xmath152 along @xmath153 and between @xmath154 and @xmath151 along @xmath155 are @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the world - function associated to points @xmath158 and the metric @xmath23 .",
    "the relative speed between the light ray and the boosted rectilinear inertial observer , defined through the ratio @xmath159 coincides with @xmath92 .    the identity between these expressions and those obtained before in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] is clear . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath136 is substituted for @xmath160 those expressions are coincident .",
    "the fact that the values of @xmath161 and @xmath162 coincide with the values @xmath163 and @xmath164 obtained in the problem solved on the cylinder is due to a local isometry between the minkowskian plane @xmath140 , which contains the line of universe of the boosted rectilinear inertial observer , and the minkowskian cylinder @xmath165 , which contains the world - line of the non - inertial rotating frame .",
    "as pointed out at the beginning of this section , the non - inertial rotating observer on the disk has a specific characteristic which other different non - inertial observers do not have , in general . in this case , the expression ( [ 135 ] ) , relating the proper time @xmath133 and the coordinate time @xmath135 , is the same as in inertial frames .",
    "this allows to build an isometry between cylinder @xmath21 and the plane @xmath166 as follows .",
    "let @xmath167 be a smooth map between a neighborhood of @xmath168 , which contains the geodesic triangle considered above , and the plane @xmath166 .",
    "denote by @xmath169 and @xmath170 the tangent spaces to @xmath21 and @xmath166 at the points @xmath171 respectively .",
    "the map @xmath172 is such that its differential , @xmath173 , is a linear isometry for every point @xmath174 : @xmath175 for every @xmath176 .",
    "let us consider a map @xmath117 such that @xmath177 .",
    "we determine a function @xmath178 satisfying condition ( [ 3000 ] ) .",
    "this function is determined through the partial differential system @xmath179 whose solution is the function @xmath180 .",
    "therefore an isometry as @xmath181 maps @xmath182 into @xmath183 , retaining the same coordinate time in both manifolds .",
    "the geodesic triangle of vertices @xmath184 in @xmath21 is mapped into the straight triangle @xmath185 in @xmath166 . therefore , it is possible to translate the problem of measuring the speed of light with respect to a non - inertial reference frame , which describes a circumference rotating uniformly , to the problem of measuring the speed of light by an inertial reference frame , being the velocity equal to @xmath186 in both cases . by means of this local isometry , for the point @xmath82 on the cylinder",
    "there exists a corresponding @xmath152 in the plane , which has the same coordinates as the event @xmath187 , obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] by means of the hypothesis of locality with the slicing of @xmath21 .    returning to the initial problem of two photons describing the periphery of a rotating disk in opposite senses",
    ", it is observed that one obtains the same result for both photons , as it may be verified solving the corresponding problem on the minkowskian plane , where the speed of light is independent of the direction followed by the photons .",
    "in @xcite , using the locus of locally simultaneous events to the non - inertial rotating observer ( given by space - like helices in a minkowski space - time ) , it is shown that the speed of light measured by a non - inertial observer fixed on the disk rim always turns out to be @xmath186 both locally and globally .",
    "the local isometry ( [ 3103034 ] ) , shows how this coincidence is obtained .",
    "in fact , this local isometry allows to calculate relative speeds ( [ 2803034 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) in the problem of the rotating disk , mapping the problem from the multiply connected minkowskian cylinder to another one established in the simply connected minkowskian plane .    from the above reasoning",
    ", one observes that although the observer is non - inertial this is not reflected on the measurements of relative speeds .",
    "this is because the module of the centripetal acceleration of the observer @xmath188 , coincides with the module of the normal curvature of the world - line of the observer on the cylinder @xmath189 .",
    "a rotating observer corresponds to a killing trajectory , so its world - line is a geodesic on this cylinder .",
    "moreover , the gaussian curvature of the cylinder is zero .",
    "so , the non - inertiality of the rotating observer is not reflected in the measurement procedure , because this is only based on the first fundamental form of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we remark that the frame of reference considered in the problem of a rotating disk is very special , so the problem can be established on a circular cylinder .",
    "a more general case would be , for example , that of a deformable closed loop filament moving and preserving a non - circular shape .",
