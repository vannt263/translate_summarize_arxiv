    "astronomical observations of the type ia supernova ( snia ) , cosmic microwave background radiation(cmb ) and the large scale structure(lss ) strongly support for a concordance model of cosmology where the universe is flat and composed of around seventy percent of dark energy(de)@xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy seems to be a remnant small cosmological constant .",
    "however , many physicists are attracted by the idea that dark energy is due to a dynamical component , such as a canonical scalar field @xmath0 , named _",
    "the recent fits to the snia data and cmb etc in the literature find that the behavior of dark energy is to great extent in consistency with a cosmological constant , however the dynamical dark energy scenarios are generally not ruled out and in fact one class of models with an equation of state(eos ) transiting from below -1 to above -1 as the redshift increases , _",
    "quintom_@xcite is mildly favored@xcite .",
    "being a dynamical component , the scalar field of dark energy is expected to interact with the ordinary matters .",
    "if these interactions exist , it will open up the possibility of detecting the dark energy non - gravitationally .",
    "recently there have been a lot of interests in the literature in studying the possible connections between the neutrinos and the dark energy.@xcite there seem to be at least two reasons which motivate these studies : 1 ) the dark energy scale @xmath1 ev is smaller than the energy scales in particle physics , but interestingly is comparable to the neutrino masses ; 2 ) in quintessence - like models of dark energy @xmath2 ev , which surprisingly is also connected to the neutrino masses _ via _ a see - saw formula @xmath3 with @xmath4 the planck mass .",
    "is there really any connections between the neutrinos and dark energy ? given the arguments above it is quite interesting to make such a speculation on this connection . if yes , however in terms of the language of the particle physics it requires the existence of new dynamics and new interactions between the neutrinos and the dark energy sector .    in general for the models of neutrino dark energy or interacting dark energy , the lagrangian can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lagrangian of the standard model ( sm ) describing the physics of the left - handed neutrinos",
    ", @xmath7 is for the dynamical scalar such as quintessence .",
    "@xmath8 in ( 1 ) is the sector which mediates the interaction between the dark energy scalar and the neutrinos .    at energy much below the electroweak scale ,",
    "the relevant lagrangian for the neutrino dark energy is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kinetic term of the neutrinos .",
    "for the dark energy scalar part of @xmath11 , two types of models have often been considered with one being the quintessence - like and another phantom - like@xcite .",
    "thus we introduce a factor @xmath12 in the front of the kinetic term of the scalar @xmath13 when @xmath14 it corresponds to quintessence - like and @xmath15 for phantom - like .",
    "@xmath16 is the potential of the scalar field .",
    "the last term of eq.(2 ) is the scalar field dependent mass of the neutrinos which characterizes the interaction between the neutrinos and the dark energy scalar . in the standard model of particle physics",
    ", the neutrino masses can be described by a dimension-5 operator @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a scale of new physics beyond the standard model which generates the @xmath19 violations , @xmath20 are the left - handed lepton and higgs doublets respectively . when the higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath21 , the left - handed neutrino receives a majorana mass @xmath22 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we considered an interaction between the neutrinos and the quintessence @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coefficient which characterizes the strength of the quintessence interacting with the neutrinos . in this scenario",
    "the neutrino masses vary during the evolution of the universe and we have shown that the neutrino mass limits imposed by the baryogenesis are modified .    the dim-5 operator above is not renormalizable , which in principle can be generated by integrating out the heavy particles . for example , in the model of the minimal see - saw mechanism for the neutrino masses , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos and the dirac masses of the neutrinos are given by @xmath28 .",
    "integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos one will generate a dim-5 operator , however as pointed out in ref.@xcite to have the light neutrino masses varied there are various possibilities , such as by coupling the quintessence field to either the dirac masses or the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos or both .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have specifically proposed a model of mass varying right - handed neutrinos . in this model",
    "the right - handed neutrino masses @xmath29 are assumed to be a function of the quintessence scalar @xmath30 .",
    "integrating out the right - handed neutrino will generate a dimension-5 operator , but for this case the light neutrino masses will vary in the following way @xmath31 with mass varying right - handed neutrinos given above we have in @xcite studied in detail its implication in thermal leptogenesis . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have studied the possibility of detecting the time variation of the neutrino masses with short gamma ray burst . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed the implications of the mass varying neutrinos in the cosmological evolution of the universe . and",
    "in ref.@xcite we argued that neutrinos coupled to phantom scalar can provide a scenario of dark energy with the equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary of -1 .",
    "in this paper we will use the recently released snia data to constrain the couplings between the neutrinos and the dark energy scalar .",
    "we will show that the current data mildly favor the model where the phantom - like scalar couples to the neutrinos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will present the formulation and the results on the constraint on the equation of state of the coupled system ; in section iii we study the constraints on the couplings of the neutrinos to the scalar fields ; section iv is our conclusion .",
    "in this section we will study in detail the scenario of the coupled system of neutrino and scalar field described by the lagrangian in ( 2 ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath23 is given by [ em ] f(+3h)++=0 , where [ sour ] = n_is the source term by the interaction between the neutrinos and dark energy , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the number density and energy of the neutrinos respectively and @xmath34 indicating the thermal average .",
    "for relativistic neutrinos , the term @xmath35 is greatly suppressed and the neutrinos and dark energy decouple . for non - relativistic neutrinos , the effective potential of the system is given by @xmath36 . in the following ,",
    "for the simplicity we take the @xmath23-depending neutrino mass @xmath37 as @xmath38 .    for this coupled system , the energy for each component does not conserve while the total number of neutrinos is constant .",
    "it is easy to get that the energy density of neutrinos follows [ ronu]_+3h_=n_. the conservation of energy - momentum tensor of the whole system gives that the fluid equation of the scalar field @xmath23 is [ rphi ] _",
    "+ 3h_(1+w_)=-n _  , with the corresponding equation of state @xmath39 , which stands for the uncoupled equation of state and f has the same convention as that in eq .",
    "( [ qfl ] ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ ronu ] ) and ( [ rphi ] ) one can easily obtain the equation of state of the whole coupled system [ whole w ] w= w_. in the following , we will use the recently released snia data@xcite to constrain this class of models .",
    "for the low redshift range covered by the geometric constraints of snia the equation of state of the coupled system can be simply parameterized as @xmath40 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 we plot the parameter space of @xmath41 constrained by the snia data .",
    "one can see the best fitting values are around @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which gives rise to an evolving eos and transiting from below -1 to above -1 as the redshift increases as shown in the right panel of fig.1 . in our case for a constant equation of state",
    "the best fitting value corresponds to @xmath44 . on the current snia fittings we have assumed the matter energy density fraction to be in the range @xmath45 , which is somewhat optimistic",
    "this will inevitably lead to some bias but does not affect the physical picture of this paper . on the degeneracies between @xmath46 and dark energy eos",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "generically one needs to add some priors or combined data analysis to extract the behaviors of dynamical dark energy@xcite .",
    "a thorough combined observational constraints on the couplings needs the modification of the boltzman code and investigations on the full set of parameter space , which is extremely time - consuming in computation with the massive neutrinos ( for a preliminary model - dependent study see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we assume a flat prior of the universe , i.e. @xmath47 .     snia limit on the dark energy model whose equation of state is @xmath40 with prior @xmath45 ; the right panel : the evolution of @xmath48 as function of scale factor @xmath49 with the center value given by the left panel . ]    from equation @xmath50 , one can see that to have @xmath48 transit from below @xmath51 to above @xmath51 as the redshift increases we need @xmath52 which implies the scalar field to be a phantom - like . in the next section",
    "we will use the snia data to constrain the coupling of the neutrinos to the scalar field .",
    "we will point out that the interaction between the neutrinos and the phantom field is crucial to the quintom scenario of dark energy .",
    "current experiments have put somewhat stringent constraints on the conventional neutrino mass .",
    "atmosphere neutrino oscillations show that there is at least one species of neutrino with mass @xmath53 ev@xcite .",
    "measurements of lss matter power spectrum are very sensitive to the total mass of neutrino and a combined analysis from wmap@xcite and sdss@xcite gives an upper bound @xmath54 ev at @xmath55 c.l .",
    "a recent analysis has optimistically constrained the upper bound to be 0.42 ev .",
    "cosmological combined constraints on @xmath56 are faced with many parameter degeneracies and a recent interesting study@xcite has shown the degeneracy between dark energy eos and neutrino mass , which can loosen the upper bound of neutrino mass .",
    "when neutrino mass is varying with time the upper bound on current @xmath56 would be reasonably relaxed and ref.@xcite has quoted the value to be around 3 ev . neutrino density fraction is related to the neutrino mass by _ h^2 = , [ sigmamu ] where h is hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath57 mpc@xmath57 . for a quantitative study below on the couplings between neutrino and dark energy scalar we will take @xmath58 to be around @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as specific examples .    in the presence of the interaction between the dark energy scalar and the neutrinos",
    ", the neutrino mass will vary as the universe expands .",
    "in general different couplings give rise to different behaviors of the mass variation . in the following",
    "we will first give a model independent analysis and then go to the detail models .    from eqs.([ronu ] ) and ( [ rphi ] ) we can get [ ronu1 ] _ = _ 0a^-3 , where @xmath62 is the mass of neutrino at present , @xmath49 being the scale factor and [ rophi1 ] _ = _ 0a^-3(1+w_)(1-_m_0^m _ n_a^3(1+w_)d m _ ) .    from the eqs.([ronu1 ] ) and ( [ rophi1 ] ) we eventually get @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 being the current critical density and @xmath65 and the friedman equation @xmath66 where [ ea2 ] e(a)^2 . in a flat universe ,",

    "the parameter space gets better constrained with the increase of @xmath58 .",
    "normally we expect that the constraints of the parameter @xmath77 should be @xmath88 for the consideration of the small @xmath71 expansion , but the current snia constraint is very weak which lead to the @xmath71 expansion of @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ mnu ] ) loses its significance in some sense as a large @xmath89 is not ruled out and even somewhat favored .",

    "the hatched denotes where @xmath90 .",
    "we should point out that in our numerical calculations we used no approximations and just set eq .",
    "( [ mnu ] ) as a parametrization .",
    "given the limitation mentioned above and the conventions in the literature for the parametrization of the eos of dark energy one may consider different types of parametrization of the neutrino mass .",
    "for an example we consider here another type of parametrization which was firstly invoked for the study of dark energy coupled with dark matter in solving the coincidence problem@xcite = aa^ , [ m2 ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constant .",
    "@xmath91 is determined by @xmath93 , and the variation of the neutrino mass is @xmath94 .",
    "correspondingly we now get [ p2 ] e(a)=(1-_m_0)a^-3()^-+_m_0a^-3 . there would be interactions between neutrinos and the scalar dark energy when @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 stands for the conventional non - interacting @xmath97cdm cosmology and @xmath98 for the `` tracking '' neutrino which would behave the same as dark energy .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite it is not applicable that neutrino and de can enter the tracking regime as early as today , since neutrino takes up a very small density fraction and dark energy only comes to dominate the universe very recently .",
    "hence we will restrict our attentions on the parameter space where @xmath99 .    in fig.3",
    "we delineate the 2@xmath86 snia constraints on the parameter space of @xmath100 .",
    "the cyan(light dashed ) , black(solid ) and red(dark dashed ) contours stand for @xmath82 and 0.06 respectively .",
    "we can see that current snia constraints are very weak and the data favor mildly the model where neutrinos interact with the phantom - like scalar .",
    "it is noteworthy that here the best fitting values show @xmath101 , which corresponds to an increase of neutrino mass with the redshift , and the behavior is similar to our first example .",
    "we find for the two parametrizations when the prior of @xmath46 is relaxed the parameter space would be constrained less stringently , but a phantom - like de coupling with neutrinos is still mildly favored .",
    "more recently the authors of ref.@xcite made the distance measurements to 71 high redshift type ia supernovae discovered during the first year of the 5-year supernova legacy survey ( snls ) .",
    "snls will hopefully discover around 700 type ia supernovas , which is an intriguing ongoing project .",
    "when performing the current snls constraints on the neutrino - de coupling , we found that the current snls data have not yet been as precise as the riess gold sample@xcite and the conclusion above has not changed .",
    "as shown by eq.@xmath50 , for snia data only the preference for a quintom - like behavior of dark energy ( where the equation of state gets across -1 ) is fully degenerate with the preference of a coupling between neutrinos and phantom - like dark energy(@xmath52 ) .",
    "in fact the fittings in section ii can also be rephrased as current snia constraints on the linearly parametrized eos of single component of dark energy , as shown in ref.@xcite . to give a more intuitive example we delineate in fig.4 the effective eos of the full coupled system given by the best fit values of fig.[fig : lin ] and fig.[fig : lc ] .",

    "the left panel stands for the model with @xmath81 and the right panel for @xmath83 .",
    "we can see they all show a quintom - like behavior . actually from eqs.([p1 ] ) and",

    "it aims to increase the discovery rate for snia to about 2,000 per year@xcite . in the following",
    "we will use the simulated three - year snap data to investigate to what an extent future snap would be able to detect or rule out the currently mildly favored couplings between dark energy and neutrino .",
    "in addition we assume a gaussian prior @xmath103 , it is close to future planck constraints .",
    "the underlying fiducial model used here is the uncoupled @xmath97cdm model with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath106 in the coupling form of eq.([mnu ] ) and @xmath107 in the form of eq.([m2 ] ) .",

    "we show the 3-year snap constraints on the coupled neutrino - de model given by eq.([mnu ] ) .",
    "the red(light dashed ) , blue(dark dashed ) and green(solid ) 2@xmath86 contours stand for @xmath82 and 0.06 respectively .",
    "we find the coupling parameter of @xmath77 is restricted to be of order unity and the parametrization of @xmath71 has made its sense when the neutrino density fraction can be order of @xmath59 .",
