    "[ fig : eachsizeevo ] , we find that behavior of @xmath311 depends strongly on the grain radius . as mentioned above , this is because each dust process works at different grain radii on different timescales .",
    "first , we discuss the evolution of the grain size in panel ( a ) . we find that @xmath311 at @xmath312 m starts to deviate from unity at the earliest galactic age among all four grain sizes . the process that causes this increase is shattering .",
    "these small grains are produced by shattering between large grains produced by stars .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in section [ subsec : resultshat ] , since shattering of a small number of large grains can produce a large number of small grains , we can not see the change of @xmath311 for @xmath313 and @xmath303 m .    at @xmath314 a few hundreds of myr , @xmath311 at @xmath315 m increases .",
    "this increase is also due to shattering .",
    "the reason why the effect of shattering appears at @xmath316 m later than at @xmath317 m is that the size distribution of shattered fragments is proportional to @xmath185 ( see section [ subsec : shattering ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the shattered fragments become dominant at smaller sizes on shorter timescales than at larger sizes .    at @xmath233  gyr , we find that the increase of @xmath311 at @xmath316 m is accelerated .",
    "this indicates that another process becomes efficient , and it is grain growth . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : shattering ] , as grain growth becomes efficient around @xmath18  gyr , the amount of grains with less than @xmath318 m increases significantly .    at @xmath319  gyr",
    ", we find that @xmath311 decrease at all sizes .",
    "these decreases are due to coagulation for small grains ( @xmath320 and @xmath293 m ) and shattering for large grains ( @xmath313 and @xmath303 m ) . as we showed in section [ subsubsec : resultcoag ] , coagulation mainly occurs between small grains .",
    "thus , the coagulation effect can not be seen at early phase of galaxy evolution when the abundance of small ( @xmath7 m ) grains is small .",
    "shattering can also occur effectively if there is a large amount of small grains because of a high grain ",
    "grain collision rate with small grains [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : shatteredrate ] ) ] .",
    "in addition , the main reason why the decrements of grains with @xmath313 and @xmath303 m are different is shattering in different ism phases .",
    "as shown in section [ subsec : paradep ] , grains with @xmath284 m are mainly dominated by shattering in wnm , while grains with @xmath300 m are dominated by shattering in cnm . in summary , at early phase of galaxy evolution ( @xmath321  myr ) , the size distribution is dominated by dust grains produced by stars , after @xmath322  myr , the dust processes in the ism begin to affect the size distribution at small size , and at @xmath319  gyr ( for @xmath310  gyr ) , various dust processes in the ism affect all sizes of grains .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : eachsizeevo ] show the cases with ( @xmath323 ) @xmath324 and ( 0.1 , 0.9 ) , respectively . compared with panel ( a ) , we find that @xmath311 at @xmath316 m does not decrease at @xmath219  gyr in panel ( b ) .",
    "this is because the timescale of coagulation becomes longer for smaller @xmath30 . from panel ( c ) ( @xmath325 ) , we find that the decrement at @xmath326 m is smaller than those in the cases of panel ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this is because the efficiency of shattering in wnm is smaller for smaller @xmath29 . however , from all the three panels , we can observe that the timing at which @xmath311 at all sizes changes due to the dust processes in the ism ( in this case , it is about @xmath51  gyr ) does not vary significantly by the change of ( @xmath327 ) for the same star formation timescale .    in order to discuss the effect of @xmath34 on the size distribution , the results are shown for the same values of the parameters as in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : eachsizeevo ] , but for @xmath328  gyr in panel ( d ) and @xmath329  gyr in panel ( e ) . compared with panel ( a )",
    ", we find that @xmath311 change at earlier stages for shorter @xmath34 at all sizes .",
    "this is explained as follows . if @xmath34 is short , the amounts of dust and metals released by stars are large at early phases of galaxy evolution .",
    "the timescales of shattering and coagulation are inversely proportional to the dust - to - gas mass ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the timescale of grain growth is inversely proportional to metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , for shorter @xmath34 , dust processes in the ism ( grain growth , shattering , and coagulation ) begin to affect the size distribution at earlier stages of galaxy evolution ( @xmath330 , @xmath51 and @xmath3  gyr for @xmath331 , and @xmath1  gyr , respectively ) .",
    "the timescale of the change of @xmath311 is roughly estimated to be @xmath332 @xmath333  gyr ( appendix  [ app : timescale ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the grain size distribution in galaxies changes drastically through the galaxy evolution because different dust processes operate on the grain size distribution at different ages .",
    "we constructed a dust evolution model taking into account the grain size distribution in a galaxy , and investigated what kind of dust processes dominate the grain size distribution at each stage of galaxy evolution . in this paper , we considered dust formation by sne  ii and agb stars , dust destruction by sn shocks in the ism , grain growth in the cnm , and grain  grain collisions ( shattering and coagulation ) in the wnm and cnm .",
    "we found that the grain size distribution in galaxies is dominated by large grains produced by stars in the early stage of galaxy evolution , but as time passes the size distribution is controlled by processes in the ism ( grain growth , shattering , and coagulation ) and the age at which these ism processes enter depends on the star formation timescale , as @xmath334  gyr .",
    "while dust production by sne  ii and agb stars , dust destruction by sn shocks , and grain growth in the cnm directly affect the total dust mass evolution , we found that the grains are predominantly large ( @xmath335@xmath221 m ) and only a small amount of small grains ( @xmath222 m ) are produced by these processes .",
    "if we take shattering and coagulation into account , the grain size distribution is modified significantly by these two processes .",
    "in particular , shattering indirectly contribute to the large increase of the total dust mass : after small grains ( @xmath7 m ) are produced by shattering , grain growth becomes more effective because of the enhanced surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "furthermore , grain growth produces a large bump in the grain size distribution around @xmath315 m .",
    "the effects of shattering in wnm and cnm on the size distribution appear at different grain radii : while grains with @xmath292 m are mainly shattered in wnm , shattering in cnm affects grains with @xmath300 m .",
    "furthermore , the effect of shattering , in particular shattering in wnm , is large enough to determine the maximum size of grains in the ism .",
    "coagulation occurs effectively after the abundance of small grains is enhanced by shattering , and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump at a larger size ( @xmath9@xmath10 m at @xmath336  gyr ) by coagulation .",
    "we conclude that the evolution of both the total dust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are related strongly to each other and the grain size distribution changes drastically through the galaxy evolution .",

    "<S> in addition to the dust production by type ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , we consider three processes in the ism : ( i ) dust destruction by sn shocks , ( ii ) metal accretion onto the surface of preexisting grains in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) ( called grain growth ) , and ( iii ) grain  grain collisions ( shattering and coagulation ) in the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and cnm . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the grain size distribution in galaxies is controlled by stellar sources in the early stage of galaxy evolution , and that afterwards the main processes that govern the size distribution changes to those in the ism , and this change occurs at earlier stage of galaxy evolution for a shorter star formation timescale ( for star formation time - scales @xmath0 and @xmath1  gyr , the change occurs about galactic age @xmath2 and @xmath3  gyr , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we only take into account the processes which directly affect the total dust mass ( dust production by sne  ii and agb stars , dust destruction by sn shocks , and grain growth ) , the grain size distribution is biased to large grains ( @xmath4@xmath5 m , where @xmath6 is the grain radius ) . therefore , shattering is crucial to produce small ( @xmath7 m ) grains . </S>",
    "<S> since shattering produces a large abundance of small grains ( consequently , the surface - to - volume ratio of grains increases ) , it enhances the efficiency of grain growth , contributing to the significant increase of the total dust mass . </S>",
    "<S> grain growth creates a large bump in the grain size distribution around @xmath8 m . </S>",
    "<S> coagulation occurs effectively after the number of small grains is enhanced by shattering , and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump at @xmath9@xmath10 m at @xmath11  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the evolutions of the total dust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are closely related to each other , and the grain size distribution changes considerably through the galaxy evolution because the dominant dust processes which regulate the grain size distribution change .    </S>",
