    "since the first discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary star in 1995 @xcite , more than 1000 planets have been found to date .",
    "most of the planets discovered were through the radial velocity @xcite and transit @xcite methods , which are the most sensitive to the planets orbiting close to their host stars .",
    "in contrast , direct imaging is the most sensitive to young planets in orbits wider than that of saturn @xcite .",
    "the gravitational microlensing method has unique sensitivity to the planets orbiting just outside of the snow line with masses down to earth mass @xcite . the snow line @xcite plays a critical role in the core accretion theory of planet formation .",
    "ices , including water ice , can condense beyond the snow line , which increases the density of solid material in the proto - planetary disk by a factor of a few , compared to the disk just inside the snow line .",
    "the higher density of solids means that the solid planetary cores can form more quickly beyond the snow line , so microlensing is unique in its ability to probe the planetary mass function at the separation where planet formation is thought to be the most efficient .    to date , the primary contribution of the microlensing method to the study of exoplanets is the statistical results indicating that cold planets in wide orbits are quite common @xcite .",
    "relatively low - mass cold neptunes or super - earths are found to be more common than gas giants , which is in rough agreement with the core accretion theory expectation .",
    "microlensing is also unique in its sensitivity to planets orbiting stars that are too faint to detect @xcite .",
    "in fact , planetary mass objects can be detected even in cases when there is no indication of a host star @xcite .",
    "the microlensing events that are monitored for the signals of extrasolar planets are mainly identified by the two main microlensing survey groups , the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ; bond et al .",
    "2001 ; sumi et al .",
    "2003 ) and the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; udalski 2003 ) .",
    "the moa survey uses the moa - ii 1.8 m telescope with a 2.2 @xmath8 field - of - view ( fov ) ccd camera moa - cam3 @xcite at mt .",
    "john university observatory in new zealand . with this large fov camera ,",
    "moa is able to observe @xmath9 of the central galactic bulge fields every hour , with a higher cadence for the fields with the largest microlensing rate .",
    "moa identifies about 600 microlensing events in progress each year and issues public alert messages as each new event is identified .",
    "the ogle survey has been conducted with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile , which is currently equipped with a 1.4@xmath10 ccd mosaic camera .",
    "however , in 2008 , when the microlensing event moa-2008-blg-379 took place , ogle was operating the ogle - iii survey using a camera with a 0.35@xmath10 fov .",
    "ogle - iii typically identified @xmath11 more events than moa - ii , but observed at a lower cadence with most fields only being observed once per night .",
    "currently , the ogle - iv survey operates at a relatively high cadence in the central galactic bulge , but covers a much wider area of sky at a lower cadence , which yields nearly 2000 microlensing event discoveries per year .",
    "most recently , the wise microlensing survey @xcite has conducted high cadence observations using a 1.0@xmath10 ccd mosaic camera on the 1.0 m wise telescope in israel .",
    "they fill the gap in longitude between moa and ogle , but due to their northerly location , they can only observe the galactic bulge for a limited amount of time each night .    microlensing follow - up groups , such as @xmath12fun , planet , robonet , and mindstep , observe microlensing events that have been previously identified by one or more of the survey groups .",
    "they aim to ensure dense , 24 hr light curve coverage on the highest priority microlensing events , and they contribute to planet discoveries in a number of ways .",
    "they can identify planetary signals in some of the microlensing events with relatively bright source stars @xcite , densely monitor high magnification microlensing events @xcite that are known to have high sensitivity to planets @xcite , or follow - up on events once potential planetary anomalies have been found by the survey teams @xcite .",
    "in addition , some events have been identified based on higher cadence observations by the survey groups prompted by the real - time identification of potential planetary anomalies @xcite . however , if the survey cadence is high enough , it is possible to identify planets from survey observations alone without the benefit of follow - up observations from either the survey or follow - up teams .",
    "the event we present here , moa-2008-blg-379 , is the planetary microlensing event that was found based on survey observations alone , similar to moa-2007-blg-192 @xcite , moa - bin-1 @xcite and moa-2011-blg-322 @xcite .",
    "we should note that there are many more planetary events , such as moa-2011-blg-293 @xcite and ogle-2012-blg-0406 @xcite , that could have been discovered based upon survey observations alone . and in fact , the primary reason for the lack of follow - up observations for moa-2007-blg-192 and moa-2008-blg-379 is the lack of experience in the microlensing community with the full range of possible planetary signals . in this paper , we report on the analysis of a planetary microlensing event moa-2008-blg-379 .",
    "section  [ sec - obs ] describes the observations of this event , and section  [ sec - data_red_mod ] describes the reduction of the data and the light curve modeling . in section  [ sec - color ]",
    ", source magnitude and color measurement using color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is discussed , and the derived angular einstein radius is discussed in section  [ sec - thetae ] . in section  [ sec - bayes ] , we use a bayesian analysis based on a standard galactic model to estimate the masses and distances of the lens system based on the angular einstein radius .",
    "discussion and our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec - conclude ] .",
    "prior to 2009 , the moa - ii observing strategy called for the observations of the two fields with the highest lensing rate every 10 minutes and observations of the remaining 20 fields every hour using the custom wide - band moa - red filter , which is roughly the sum of the cousins @xmath13- and @xmath14-bands .",
    "moa-2008-blg-379 was discovered in field gb8 , which was observed with an hourly cadence in 20062008 .",
    "the microlensing event moa-2008-blg-379 was identified by the moa alert system @xcite at @xmath15 = ( @xmath16 , -@xmath17 ) , and was announced by the moa collaboration at ut 22:00 , 2008 august 9 , ( or @xmath18 ) . as can be seen from the light curve in figure  [ light curve ] ,",
    "this was after the first caustic entrance and exit and the central cusp approach feature .",
    "given the sparse coverage and lack of ogle data at this time , it was not immediately obvious that this event was anomalous .",
    "two weeks later , at ut 20:00 2008 august 23 , the event was also identified and announced by the ogle early warning system ( ews ; @xcite ) as ogle-2008-blg-570 .",
    "the delay in the identification of this event by ogle was due to the fact that the source was faint and was not located close to the location of a  star \" that was identified in the ogle reference image .",
    "this is fairly common , as most bulge main sequence stars are not individually resolved at @xmath19 resolution .",
    "the source star , moa-2008-blg-379s , happens to be located at an unusually large distance from the nearest star in the ogle catalog , and as a result , it could only be found via the  new object \" channel of the ogle ews . in 2008 this channel was not run as often as the regular  resolved star \" channel of the ogle ews . as a result , both the moa and ogle collaboration groups observed this event with normal cadence .",
    "the moa and ogle data for moa-2008-blg-379 were reduced using the respective moa @xcite and ogle @xcite photometry pipelines .",
    "the initial reductions used the normal photometry available on the respective moa and ogle alert web sites , and these data were used to show that the correct model involved a planet .",
    "however , it was possible to obtain improved photometry for both the moa and ogle data sets .",
    "the improved moa photometry used ",
    "cameo \" sub - images centered on the target , and the improved ogle photometry was redone with source position determined from difference images and a careful selection of reference images .",
    "both the ogle and moa photometry were found to have systematic errors at the beginning and/or end of each observing season when observations are only possible at high airmass .",
    "this may be due to low - level variability for a very bright star about 3 arc seconds from the source , moa-2008-blg-379s .",
    "so we removed the moa data prior to @xmath20 , leaving 951 moa data points in the range @xmath21 .",
    "the ogle data consist of 294 @xmath14-band observations and 7 @xmath22-band observations , as shown in table [ info ] .",
    "the error bar estimates from the photometry codes are normally accurate to a factor of 2 or better , and they provide a good estimate of the relative photometry errors for each data set .",
    "these are sufficient to find the best light curve model , but in order to estimate the fit parameter uncertainties ,",
    "we need more accurate error bars , which have @xmath23 for each data set . therefore , once we have found the best fit model with the unmodified error bars , we modify the error bars with the formula @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the input error bar estimate ( in magnitudes ) for the @xmath26th data point , @xmath27 is the normalization factor , and @xmath28 is the minimum error .",
    "the modified error bars , @xmath29 , are used for all subsequent modeling and parameter uncertainty determination .",
    "the factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are estimated for each data set with the following procedure .",
    "first , we plot the cumulative distribution of @xmath30 as a function of the size of the input error bars , @xmath25 . then , we chose the value of @xmath31 such that the cumulative distribution is a straight line with slope of unity .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath27 is chosen to give @xmath32 for each data set .",
    "for this event , we find that @xmath33 for all data sets .",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all three data sets are listed in table [ info ] .",
    "this event was identified in a systematic modeling of all anomalous events ( i.e.  those not well fit by a point source , single lens model without microlensing parallax ) from the moa alert pages ( https://it019909.massey.ac.nz/moa/ ) from the 2007 - 2010 seasons .",
    "a similar analysis of ogle - iii binary events was conducted by @xcite .",
    "the light curve calculations for this systematic analysis were done using the image centered ray - shooting method @xcite .",
    "all the events that have anomalous deviation from a point source , single lens model were fitted with the binary lens model according to the following procedure .",
    "binary lens models have three parameters that are in common with single lens models .",
    "these parameters are the time of the closest approach to the lens system center of mass @xmath34 , the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath35 , and the impact parameter @xmath36 , in units of the angular einstein radius @xmath37 .",
    "binary lens models also require three additional parameters .",
    "these are the lens system planet - star mass ratio , @xmath38 , the planet - star separation , @xmath39 , projected into the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight , and the angle of the source trajectory relative to the binary lens axis @xmath40 .",
    "another parameter , the source radius crossing time , @xmath41 is also included in the binary lens model because this parameter is important for most of planetary microlensing light curves .",
    "we carefully searched to find the best fit binary lens model over a wide range of values of microlensing parameters using a variation of the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm @xcite . because the shape of anomaly features in the light curve well depends on @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "these three parameters are fixed in the first search .",
    "next , we searched @xmath42 minima of the 100 models in order of @xmath42 in the first search with each parameter free and found the best fit model .",
    "this analysis indicated a planetary mass ratio for the moa-2008-blg-379l lens system .",
    "figure [ light curve ] shows the light curve of this event and the best fit models .",
    "there are five distinct caustic crossing and cusp approach features in the light curve .",
    "the first caustic crossing is sandwiched between a single observation by ogle and five moa observations beginning 96 minutes later at @xmath43 , the subsequent , very bright , caustic exit was observed with a single ogle observation on the subsequent night , but the central cusp approach feature and the next caustic entrance feature were reasonably well sampled by 9 and 7 moa observations , respectively , on the next two nights .",
    "it is the sampling of these two features that allow the parameters of the planetary lens model for this event to be determined .    for many binary events and most planetary events ,",
    "the light curve has very sharp features due to caustic crossings or cusp approaches that resolve the finite size of the source star .",
    "such features require an additional parameter , the source radius crossing time , @xmath41 .",
    "since the moa-2008-blg-379 includes caustic crossings and a close cusp approach , it is necessary to include finite source effects in its light curve model , and a proper accounting of finite source effects requires that limb darkening be included .    for the limb darkening coefficients",
    ", we adopted a linear limb - darkening model for the source star based on the source color estimate of @xmath44 , which is discussed below in section  [ sec - color ] .",
    "this color implies that the source is a late g - star , with an effective temperature of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we use limb - darkening parameters from @xcite for a source star with an effective temperature @xmath46 , surface gravity @xmath47 , and metallicity @xmath48}=0.0 $ ] .",
    "isochrones @xcite suggest that the source may be a metal poor star if it is located at the distance of the galactic center , but @xmath48}=0.0 $ ] is consistent within the 1-@xmath49 error bar .",
    "the list of the coefficients used for the linear limb - darkening model are as follows , 0.7107 for @xmath22 , 0.5493 for @xmath14 , and 0.5919 for moa - red , which is the mean of the coefficients for the cousins @xmath13 and @xmath14-bands .",
    "these are listed in table [ info ] .    as is commonly the case for high magnification events",
    ", there are two degenerate light curve solutions that can explain the observed light curve .",
    "this is the well - known  close - wide \" degeneracy , where the solutions have nearly identical parameters except that the separation is modified by the @xmath50 transformation .",
    "figure [ caustic ] shows the two caustic configurations from the close and wide models for this event .",
    "sometimes , when the planetary caustics have merged with the central caustic to form a so - called resonant caustic curve , as in this case , the light curve data can resolve this close - wide degeneracy .",
    "we can see in figure  [ light curve ] that the close and wide light curves do have substantial differences , such as the time of the final caustic exit .",
    "however , the observations for this event are too sparse to sample these light curve features , and the degeneracy remains .",
    "fortunately , the parameters for these two solutions differ by only @xmath51% , so this degeneracy has little effect on the inferred physical parameters of the lens system .",
    "we find @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the close model , which is preferred by @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for the wide model .",
    "the full set of fit parameters are listed in table  [ params ] .",
    "higher order effects such as microlens parallax , xallarap ( source star orbital motion ) and orbital motion in the lens system have been detected in some previous events@xcite .",
    "the measurement of finite source effects or microlensing parallax effects can partially break the degeneracies of the physical parameters that can be inferred from the microlensing light curve , and the measurement of both microlensing parallax and finite source effects yields a direct measurement of the lens system mass @xcite . for this event",
    ", however , the source is too faint for a reliable microlensing parallax measurement for an event of its duration , and the relatively sparse data sampling leaves some uncertainty in the measurement of the source radius crossing time .",
    "therefore , we use the light curve constraints on the source radius crossing time to constrain the physical parameters of the lens system using a bayesian analysis based on a standard galactic model , as discussed in section [ sec - bayes ] . if the lens star can be detected in high angular resolution follow - up observations , it will then be possible to directly determine the physical parameters of the lens system @xcite .",
    "the source star magnitude and color estimated from the light curve modeling are affected by extinction and reddening due to interstellar dust .",
    "these effects must be removed in order to infer the intrinsic brightness and color of the source star . in order to estimate extinction and reddening",
    ", we use the centroid of the red clump giant ( rcg ) distribution , which is an approximate standard candle .",
    "the cmd , shown in figure  [ cmd_ogle ] was made from stars from the ogle - iii catalog @xcite within @xmath59 from the source star . from this cmd",
    ", we have found the rcg centroid to be at @xmath60    we adopt the intrinsic rcg centroid @xmath61 color  and magnitude from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , which gives @xmath62 comparing the our measured rcg centroid from equation  ( [ eq : rcg ] ) with the intrinsic dereddened magnitude and extinction from equation  ( [ eq : rcg0 ] ) , we find that the reddening and extinction are @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the average reddening and @xmath65 is the average extinction .",
    "the models presented in table  [ params ] give the source magnitude and color of @xmath66 and @xmath67 from the ogle observations , calibrated to the ogle - iii photometry map @xcite .",
    "this color is bluer than most of the bulge main sequence stars at this magnitude , but with the error bars , it is marginally consistent with a bulge main sequence star , as shown in figure  [ cmd_ogle ] .",
    "this could be due to the fact that there is only a single bright ogle @xmath22-band image that might be affected by a nearby bright variable star .    because the moa - red passband is centered at a slightly shorter wavelength than the ogle @xmath14-band",
    ", we can use the moa - red and ogle @xmath14 passbands to derive the source color @xcite .",
    "although the color difference between these two passbands is relatively small , we have a large number of data points at significant magnification in both of these passbands .",
    "so , this method should yield a color that is less sensitive to systematic photometry errors than the determination based on the single magnified ogle @xmath22-band measurement . in order to calibrate the moa - red measurements to the ogle - iii ( @xmath22 , @xmath14 ) system",
    ", we use the ogle - iii photometry map @xcite and a dophot @xcite reduction of the moa reference frame . because the seeing in the moa reference frame is significantly worse than the seeing images used for the ogle - iii catalog , we choose isolated ogle stars for the comparison with moa to avoid problems due to blending in the moa images . in order to select the stars with small uncertainty in magnitude and color , we remove faint stars with @xmath68 and stars with a @xmath61 error bar @xmath69 . in order to obtain an accurate linear relation ,",
    "we only fit stars in the color range @xmath70 .",
    "we recursively reject @xmath71 outliers and find @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the ogle - iii catalog magnitudes , and @xmath75 is the calibrated moa - red band magnitude .",
    "( the moa - red calibration has a zero - point uncertainty of 0.0144 mag . )",
    "the moa light curve photometry @xcite is done with the difference imaging analysis ( dia ; @xcite ) , which is usually significantly more precise than dophot , but dia only measures changes in brightness , which is why dophot photometry is used to derive the relation in equation  [ eq - rm - io ] between the @xmath76 and standard @xmath61 colors .",
    "thus , it is important that the moa - red band photometry from the dia and dophot codes have identical magnitude scales .",
    "this is accomplished by using the dophot point - spread function for the dia photometry . using the source magnitudes from the light curve modeling , this procedure yields @xmath77 for the best fit model . as shown in figure [ cmd_ogle ] , this source magnitude and color are more reasonable for a bulge source than the less precise color derived from ogle @xmath22-band measurements , and it is the one that we use in our analysis .    combining the extinction from equation  ( [ eq : ext_and_red ] ) with the source magnitudes and colors from the best fit wide and close models , we have @xmath78    also , from the light curve models , we have determined the magnitude of the unlensed flux at the location of the source . this is the flux of the stars with images blended with the source .",
    "the flux from the blend stars is often used as an upper limit for the magnitude of the lens star . in this event",
    ", however , we found that the blending flux in the light curve is dominated by the flux from a bright star @xmath79 away from the event by the careful inspection of the ogle reference image .",
    "we found no star is resolved at the position of the event and thus the real upper limit of the lens magnitude is fainter .",
    "if we assume that the extinction to these blend stars are the same as the source ( which is a reasonable approximation if the stars are at a distance of @xmath80kpc ) , then we have the extinction - free 3-@xmath49 limit of blend magnitude @xmath81 , which will be used as an upper limit for the magnitude of the planetary host star in section [ sec - bayes ] .",
    "with the use of @xmath82 , we can determine the source angular radius with the color surface - brightness relation of @xcite , @xmath83 this yields an angular source radius of @xmath84as .",
    "@xmath85 is also able to be derived from the method of @xcite with @xmath86 estimated from the dwarf star color - color relations from @xcite , but the result is consistent with the above value .",
    "we can combine this value of @xmath85 with the fit source radius crossing time , @xmath41 , values from the light curve models to determine the lens - source relative proper motion , @xmath87 note that this is the relative proper motion in the instantaneously geocentric inertial reference frame that moved with the earth when the event reached peak magnification .",
    "the measurement of @xmath41 also yields the angular einstein radius @xmath88 which can be used to help constrain the lens mass .",
    "as we discuss in section [ sec - conclude ] , follow - up observations might be able to detect the lens separating the source and measure the lens - source relative proper motion . however , this would be in the heliocentric reference frame rather than the instantaneously geocentric inertial frame used for equations  ( [ eq : mu_rel_w ] ) and ( [ eq : mu_rel_c ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the follow - up observations and light curve model provide enough information to convert between these two reference frames .    for this paper ,",
    "however , we have not been able to distinguish the wide and close models , so to obtain our final predictions , we combine the values from the wide and close models with weights given by @xmath89 .",
    "this gives an angular einstein radius and lens - source relative proper motion of @xmath90 with the lens - source relative proper motion in the same instantaneous geocentric inertial reference frame used for equations  ( [ eq : mu_rel_w ] ) and ( [ eq : mu_rel_c ] ) .",
    "a microlensing light curve for a single lens event normally has the lens distance , mass , and angular velocity with respect to the source constrained by only a single measured parameter , the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath35 .",
    "but , like most planetary microlensing events , moa-2008-blg-379 has finite source effects that allow @xmath91 , and therefore @xmath37 , to be measured .",
    "if we could have also measured the microlensing parallax effect , we could determine the total lens system mass @xcite .    without a microlensing parallax measurement ,",
    "we are left with the relation @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the mass of the lens system , and @xmath95 is the distance to the source star .",
    "this can be interpreted as a lens mass  distance relation , since @xmath95 is approximately known .",
    "we can now use this mass - distance relation , equation  ( [ eq : mass - dist ] ) , in a bayesian analysis to estimate the physical properties of the lens system @xcite .",
    "our bayesian analysis used the galactic model of @xcite with an assumed galactic center distance of 8 kpc with model parameters selected from the mcmc used to find the best fit model .",
    "the lens magnitude is constrained to be less than the blend magnitudes presented in equation  ( [ eq : ib ] ) .",
    "since the best fit wide model is slightly disfavored by @xmath96 , we weight the wide model markov chains by @xmath97 with respect to the close model markov chains .",
    "the probability distributions resulting from this bayesian analysis are shown in figures [ like - out ] and [ like_filter ] .    an important caveat to this bayesian analysis",
    "is that we have assumed that stars of all masses , as well as brown dwarfs , are equally likely to host a planet with the measured mass ratio and separation .",
    "because of this assumption , the results of this bayesian analysis can not ( directly ) be used to determine the probability that stars will host planets as a function of their mass . with this caveat ,",
    "the star and planet masses resulting from the bayesian analysis are @xmath98 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "their projected separation was determined to be @xmath99 , and the lens system is at a distance of @xmath100 .",
    "the three - dimensional star - planet separation is estimated to be @xmath101 , assuming a random inclination and phase .",
    "these values are listed in table [ like_out ] .",
    "therefore , the most likely physical parameters from the bayesian analysis , indicate that the planet has a mass of nearly 4 jupiter - masses and orbits a late k - dwarf host star at just over twice the distance of the snow line .",
    "we reported on the discovery and analysis of a planetary microlensing event moa-2008-blg-379 . as is often the case with high magnification microlensing events , there are two degenerate models : a close model with a planet - host separation of @xmath102 and a wide model with @xmath103 .",
    "both have a mass ratio of @xmath104 .",
    "our bayesian analysis indicates that the lens system consists of a g , k , or m - dwarf orbited by a super - jupiter mass planet .",
    "the most likely physical properties for the lens system , according to the bayesian analysis , are that the host is a late k - dwarf , and the planet has a mass of about 4 jupiter masses with a projected separation of about @xmath105au",
    ". however , these values are dependent on our prior assumption that stars of different masses have equal probabilities to host a planet of the observed mass ratio and separation .",
    "fortunately , the parameters of this event are quite favorable for a direct determination of the lens system mass and distance by the detection of the lens separating from the source star in high angular resolution follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "the source star is quite faint at @xmath106 , so it is unlikely that the lens will be very much fainter than the source .",
    "the brightness of the source is compared to the bayesian analysis predictions for the lens ( host ) star in the @xmath22- , @xmath14- , @xmath107- , and @xmath108-bands in figure [ like_filter ] .",
    "this indicates that the lens star is likely to have a similar brightness to the source in all of these passbands . also , it is unlikely that the lens and source magnitudes will differ by more than 2 mag in any of these passbands , so both the source and lens should be detectable .",
    "the measured source radius crossing time indicates a relatively large lens - source relative proper motion of @xmath109 ( measured in the inertial geocentric reference frame moving at the velocity of the earth at the peak of the event ) .",
    "this implies a separation of @xmath110mas in the later half of 2013 when high resolution follow - up observations were obtained from keck and the @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "( because the relative proper motion , @xmath113 , is measured in an instantaneously geocentric reference frame , it can not be directly converted into a precise separation prediction , but the conversion to the heliocentric reference frame , which is more relevant to the follow - up observation , usually results in a small change . ) the results of these follow - up observations will be reported in a future publication , but it seems quite likely that the planetary host star will be detected , resulting in a complete solution of the lens system .",
    "that is , the lens masses , distance and separation will all be determined in physical units .",
    "one unfortunate feature of this discovery is that moa-2008-blg-379 was not recognized as a planetary microlensing event when it was observed .",
    "this was partly due to the faintness of the source star , which rendered the relatively long planetary perturbation as the dominant portion of the magnified light curve .",
    "however , the lack of familiarity with the complete variety of binary lens and planetary microlensing light curves also played a role in this lack of recognition .",
    "the planetary nature of the event was discovered as a result of a systematic effort to model all of the binary microlensing events that were found by the moa alert system .",
    "fortunately , the joint analysis of ogle data and the high cadence moa - ii survey observations allowed the planetary nature of the event to be establish and the basic planetary lens parameters to be measured .",
    "the moa - ii high cadence survey was enabled by the wide , @xmath114 field moa - cam3 that enabled hourly survey observations . in 2010 march ,",
    "the ogle group started the ogle - iv survey with their new @xmath115 ccd camera , and they now also conduct a high cadence survey of the central galactic bulge . this new camera and the good seeing available at the ogle site ( las campanas ) has substantially increased the rate in which planetary deviations are discovered in survey observations .",
    "the combination of the moa - ii and ogle - iv high cadence surveys greatly improves the light curve sampling of these survey microlensing planet discoveries due to the large separation in longitude between the moa and ogle telescopes .",
    "the capabilities of microlensing follow - up teams are also rapidly improving , most notably with the recent expansion @xcite of the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) , which should result in much higher light curve sampling rates of planetary signals discovered in progress .",
    "we acknowledge the following sources of support : the moa project was supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( jsps19015005 , jsps19340058 , jsps20340052 , jsps20740104 ) .",
    "d.s .  was supported by grant - in - aid for jsps fellows .",
    "d.p.b .  was supported by grants nasa - nnx12af54 g , jpl - rsa 1453175 and nsf ast-1211875 .",
    "the ogle project has received funding from the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013)/erc grant agreement no .",
