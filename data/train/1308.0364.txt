    "neutron - proton ( n - p ) pair correlations are potentially important in a number of physical contexts , including the mechanism of the deuteron formation in heavy - ion collisions@xcite at intermediate energies and supernova@xcite . in the context of nuclear structure , as evidenced by the recent experimental findings@xcite on excited states in @xmath4pd , heavy nuclei may feature spin - aligned n - p pairs , and moreover the exotic nuclei with extended halos provide a locus for n - p pairing .",
    "in addition , the n - p pairing may play a major role in determining the cooling and rotation dynamics in the model of  nucleon stars \" which permits pion or kaon condensation@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the n - p pairing crucially depends on the overlap between the neutron and proton fermi surfaces .",
    "the pairing correlation is suppressed when the system is driven out of the isospin - symmetric case . at low temperature ,",

    "however , a shift of the neutron and proton fermi spheres with respect to each other , which results in a nonzero total momentum of the cooper pairs , is expected to enhance the overlap between the two fermi surfaces .",
    "the overlap region then provides the kinematical phase space for pairing phenomena to occur . in this configuration space",

    "the resulting inhomogeneous superconducting state is called fflo state@xcite . another possible mechanism enhancing the overlap between the separated fermi surfaces of neutron and proton in asymmetric nuclear matter",
    "is the deformation of the two fermi surfaces@xcite , which causes the formation of dfs ( deformed fermi surfaces ) state .",

    ", the previous studies of the dfs state@xcite and the fflo sate@xcite adopt the angle - averaging procedure which has been proved to be a quite good approximation in symmetry nuclear matter@xcite by considering the pairing gap as an isotropic one .",
    "in fact , our previous work@xcite indicates the angle dependence of the pairing gap should be taken into account when calculating the pairing gap in asymmetric nuclear matter at low temperature . in ref.@xcite , we have proposed an axi - symmetric angle - dependent gap ( adg ) state which corresponds to the axi - symmetric deformation of the neutron and proton fermi spheres . in the adg state ,",
    "the rotational symmetry is broken spontaneously and there exists a symmetry breaking axis . while in the fflo configuration , both the rotational and translational symmetries are spontaneously broken and the axis of symmetry breaking is along the direction of the total cooper pair momentum . to determinate the structure of the true ground state for bulk isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we should consider the fflo and adg state together within the same model as done in ref.@xcite .",

    ", the angle dependence of the pairing gap may result in the deformation of the neutron and proton fermi spheres .",
    "moreover , the fflo state corresponds to a shift of the two fermi spheres with respect to each other . in this paper",
    ", we consider these two mechanisms together and investigate the fflo - adg state with arbitrary angle between the direction of the cooper pair momentum and the symmetry - axis of adg .",
    "two kinds of local stable states are found .",
    "one corresponds to the direction of the pair momentum perpendicular to the symmetry - axis of adg ( the fflo - adg - orthogonal state ) , the other is related to the direction of the pair momentum parallel to the symmetry - axis of adg ( the fflo - adg - parallel state ) .",
    "it is shown the fflo - adg - orthogonal state possesses the lowest free energy at small isospin asymmetries , whereas the fflo - adg - parallel state is favored for large asymmetries .",
    "the transitions from both the adg and fflo - adg - orthogonal states to the fflo - adg - parallel state are of the first order . on the contrary ,",
    "the transition from the adg state to the fflo - adg - orthogonal state is of the second order .",
    "moreover , the transitions from the three superconducting states ( adg , fflo - adg - orthogonal and fflo - adg - parallel states ) to the normal state are of the second order .    in the previous studies such as ref.@xcite ,",
    "the effect of the angle dependence of the pairing gap is abandoned , i.e. , supposing the neutron and proton spheres as isotropic ones .",
    "thus , the fflo states are degenerate for arbitrary directions of the cooper pair momentum .",
    "in fact , for the n - p pairing in asymmetric nuclear matter , the angle dependence of the pairing gap can compensate the effect due to the splitting of the neutron and proton fermi surfaces@xcite . in the axi - symmetric adg configuration , one particular direction ( the symmetry - axis of adg )",
    "is selected . in this case , the fflo state with angle - dependent gap is nondegenerate for the orientations of the cooper pair momentum .",
    "only two orientations are shown to be local stable , corresponding to the fflo - adg - orthogonal and fflo - adg - parallel states , respectively . as pointed out in ref.@xcite that the adg configuration is related to the deformation of the neutron and proton fermi spheres .",
    "the fflo - adg - parallel / orthogonal state may correspond to more complicated deformation of the neutron and proton fermi spheres . in this improved calculation , both",
    "the value of the pairing gap and the domain of @xmath116 in which the superconducting state exists become large .",
    "especially for the temperature @xmath105 mev , the adg state vanishes at @xmath147 , whereas the fflo - adg - parallel state vanishes at @xmath140 .",
    "the combination of the fflo and adg states promotes the onset of n - p pairing for large asymmetry .",
    "here we only consider the nuclear saturation density @xmath100 at the low temperature of @xmath105 mev .",
    "the properties of fflo - adg - parallel / orthogonal state are expected to be similar for high densities at low temperature . at low densities and/or high temperatures",
    "the effect of the angle dependence of the pairing gap becomes weak , and the difference among the adg , fflo - adg - parallel and fflo - adg - orthogonal states may become unobvious .    in adg state , the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken [ the o(3 ) symmetry breaks down to the o(2 ) symmetry ] .",
    "moreover , the translation and rotational symmetries are both broken in the fflo - adg - parallel state , however , the o(2 ) rotational symmetry is maintained . in the fflo - adg - orthogonal state ,",
    "the o(2 ) rotational symmetry is broken as well .",
    "as is well known , the continuous symmetry breaking leads to collective excitations with vanishing minimal frequency ( goldstone s modes ) .",
    "the symmetry breaking of the fflo - adg - parallel / orthogonal state may imply new complicated collective bosonic modes in asymmetric nuclear matter ( except the collective motion of the cooper pairs ) .",
    "we only consider the simplest ff state ( @xmath148 ) with adg in the paper .",
    "in fact , the fflo state is much more complicated , the structure of the true ground state remains for the future work .",
