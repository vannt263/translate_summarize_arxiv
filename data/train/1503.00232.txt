    "a basic question in the study of superconductivity is on an upper limit of the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it has been suggested that the maximum of @xmath0 is in the range from 30k to 40k when the superconducting transition is based on the electron - phonon interaction [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "the prime reason of low @xmath0 for the electron - phonon mechanism is that the debye frequency @xmath1 is of the order of 100k and @xmath0 is reduced by more than one digit than @xmath1 . in general",
    ", the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath2 is small .",
    "thus there is an upper limit for @xmath0 within the electron - phonon mechanism .",
    "the interaction of large energy scale will be responsible for high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the electronic origin mechanisms of superconductivity are worth studying in the search of high temperature superconductors .",
    "the electronic interaction comes from the coulomb interaction between electrons . from this point of view",
    ", it is important to consider the intra - atomic coulomb interactions that are of the order of ev",
    ". then a question arises as to whether the superconductivity is indeed induced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "this subject has been studied intensively by using electronic models with the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath3 including the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model [ 3 - 26 ] , the d - p model [ 27 - 33 ] and also the ladder hubbard model [ 34 - 38 ] .    it remains matter of controversial as to whether the 2d hubbard model accounts for high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "most of the results of quantum monte carlo methods have failed to show the existence of superconductivity [ 13,14,18 ] , and some results , however , still keep open the possibility of superconductivity [ 15 , 24 ] .",
    "we must note that quantum monte carlo methods are methods being applicable only in the weakly correlated region where @xmath4 is not large and is at most from 4 to 5 .",
    "the existence of superconductivity in strongly correlated regions should be considered further .",
    "this may account for properties of high - temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "superconductivity in the strongly correlated region is described by using the 2d hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 are transfer integrals and @xmath3 is the on - site coulomb energy . the transfer integral @xmath7 is non - zero @xmath8 for nearest - neighbor pair @xmath9 and @xmath10 for next - nearest neighbor pair @xmath11 ;",
    "otherwise @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "we denote the number of sites as @xmath12 and the number of electrons as @xmath13 .",
    "the ground state of the hubbard model is divided into two regions , that is , a weak correlation region and a strong correlation region .",
    "when the coulomb interaction @xmath3 is as large as or greater than the bandwidth @xmath14 , the ground state should be regarded as the strongly correlated one [ 39 , 40 ] .",
    "we use the gutzwiller ansatz and evaluate the superconducting condensation energy econd for d - wave pairing .",
    "the wave function is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gutzwiller operator @xmath17 with the parameter @xmath18 in the range of @xmath19 .",
    "the gap function @xmath20 in the bcs function @xmath21 is regarded as a variational parameter .",
    "@xmath22 is a projection operator that extracts only the state with a fixed total electron number @xmath13 .",
    "the condensation energy is defined as @xmath23 for the optimized gap function @xmath24 .",
    "we show econd as a function of @xmath3 in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath25 increases rapidly near @xmath26 as going into the strongly correlated region .",
    "@xmath25 is very small in the weakly correlated region for @xmath27 and almost vanishes for @xmath28 . for such small value of @xmath25 , it is certainly hard to obtain a signal of superconductivity by means of numerical methods such as the quantum monte carlo method .",
    "it follows from fig.1 that high temperature superconductivity is possible only in the strongly correlated region .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 is favorable for superconductivity .",
    "similar results have been reported for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ref . [",
    "26 ] .     in units of @xmath33 for @xmath28 and @xmath34 on @xmath35 lattice .",
    "the number of electrons is @xmath36 for @xmath28 and @xmath37 for @xmath34 .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ fig1 ]",
    "let us examine when the critical temperature @xmath0 is enhanced in correlated - electron systems .",
    "a layered crystal structure is obviously an important factor .",
    "the increase of the density of states in a layered crystal is certainly important and an interlayer interaction plays a significant role in finding new superconductors [ 41 - 45 ] .",
    "apart from this , if there is an interaction that promotes superconductivity cooperating with the coulomb interaction , @xmath0 will be increased .",
    "the @xmath38-wave pairing state in the hubbard model will be more stabilized by weak nearest - neighbor attractive interactions .",
    "we consider the exchange interaction @xmath39 and attractive interaction @xmath40 given as @xmath41 this is so called the t - u - j - v model . in high - temperature cuprates ,",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath39 arises as a super - exchange interaction between d electrons in copper atoms , which is mediated by oxygen atoms .",
    "the last term with negative @xmath40 is expected to arise from the electron - phonon interaction [ 46 ] . in the variational monte carlo calculations , both @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath42 ) act as an attractive interaction for nearest - neighbour pairs of electrons .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz is also adopted here .",
    "we use the electron - hole transformation to fix the electron number in @xmath21 instead of using @xmath22 [ 47 ] .",
    "we show the results in figs.2 and 3 .",
    "in fig.2 we compare @xmath43 for @xmath44 = 0 , 0.1 and 0.2 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "basically the exchange coupling @xmath39 works effectively in a similar way to @xmath3 to form the d - wave pairing .",
    "we obtain a similar result for the interaction @xmath40 , where the lowering of the energy @xmath43 by @xmath40 is smaller than that by @xmath39 . it should be noted , however , that @xmath39 alone can not stabilize the d - wave pairing , which means that if @xmath3 is small , the d - wave superconducting state is not realized even for @xmath47 .",
    "this is shown in fig.3 where @xmath43 is shown as a function @xmath20 with @xmath48 and @xmath28 for @xmath49 and 12 .",
    "@xmath25 is very small for @xmath49 and vanishes for small @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that the strong on - site correlation is needed so that the exchange coupling @xmath39 induces superconductivity .     in units of @xmath33 . from the top",
    ", we set @xmath39 = 0 , 0.1 and 0.3 for parameters @xmath3 = 12 and @xmath50 = 0.2 .",

    ", width=340 ]     in units of @xmath33 . the condensation energy as a function of @xmath20 in units of @xmath33 for @xmath39 = 0.1 and @xmath50 = 0 where @xmath3 = 8 and @xmath3 = 12 .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "we have investigated the two - dimensional t - u - j - v hubbard model .",
    "the condensation energy becomes large in the strongly correlated region , suggesting a possibility of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "we mention here that there is a report that suggests a high - temperature superconductivity in the moderate-@xmath3 region by means of the dynamical mean field theory [ 25 ] .",
    "we must further clarify a consistency with the results obtained by the quantum monte carlo method .",
    "the exchange interaction @xmath39 and the nearest - neighbor attractive interaction @xmath40 cooperate with the coulomb interaction @xmath3 to enhance superconductivity .",
    "it is important that the exchange coupling @xmath39 alone can not promote superconductivity if @xmath3 is small in the weakly correlated region .",
    "we expect that the strong @xmath3 and weak @xmath39 and @xmath40 may realize high critical temperature",
