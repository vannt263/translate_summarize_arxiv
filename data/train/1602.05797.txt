    "in recent years , triplet superconductivity has attracted much attention , which provides the possibility to realize the nondissipative spin transport and hence has potential application in spintronics.@xcite to confirm or realize the triplet superconductivity , much efforts have been made to several potential systems , including the unconventional superconductor @xmath4,@xcite the conventional superconductor - ferromagnet ( s - f ) interface with induced odd - frequency and even - momentum triplet pairings,@xcite conventional superconductors with induced spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the surface or interface which possess even - frequency and odd - momentum triplet pairings,@xcite and the non - centrosymmetric superconductors including the heavy fermion system.@xcite    specifically , @xmath4 was suggested to be the triplet @xmath1-wave superconductor which may arise from the spin - fluctuation - induced attractive potential between the triplet states,@xcite whose experimental confirmation is still in progress.@xcite in conventional s - f interface , it is shown that with the existence of the exchange field due to the ferromagnet , the spin - degeneracy is lifted .",
    "accordingly , the odd - frequency and even - momentum triplet cooper pairings emerge at the interface of s - f , in which the triplet order parameter is further shown to be zero.@xcite one notes that the order parameter directly contributes to the superconducting gap .",
    "specifically , it is well established that with the inhomogeneous ferromagnet , the induced triplet pairs can diffuse into the ferromagnetic materials over distances much larger than the singlet ones , which is referred to as long - range proximity effect.@xcite similar to the exchange field , soc can also lift the spin degeneracy and hence provides another possibility to realize the triplet superconductivity.@xcite this possibility was first pointed out by gorkov and rashba when considering the @xmath0-wave superconductivity with the soc induced by the absorption of ion.@xcite it was shown that due to the lift of the spin - degeneracy by the soc , mixed singlet - triplet cooper pairings arise in which the triplet part is odd - momentum and even - frequency .",
    "we point out here that with the momentum - independent attractive potential between electrons from the @xmath0-wave channel , no triplet gap or triplet order parameter arises in the superconductor . as a natural extension ,",
    "much efforts are focused on the system with the soc in proximity to the @xmath0-wave superconductors , including spin - orbit - coupled metals@xcite and even semiconductors.@xcite finally , in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor , with the soc naturally existing in the superconductor itself , it is shown that if proper forms of _ attractive _ effective electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction potential are realized from the symmetry analysis , triplet gap or triplet order parameter can be realized.@xcite specifically , it is shown that when the @xmath5-vector of the triplet order parameter is parallel to the effective magnetic field due to the soc , the system can have minimum free energy.@xcite    in above systems , one can see that in @xmath4 and non - centrosymmetric superconductors , the triplet order parameter can naturally arise from proper effective e - e interaction potential.@xcite however , their experimental confirmations are still in progress.@xcite in contrast to this , the triplet superconductivity in the system with the zeeman field or soc,@xcite which is in proximity to the @xmath0-wave superconductor , is relatively easy to be realized and manipulated with the flexible manipulation of the strength and type of the soc.@xcite specifically , the triplet superconductivity in conventional s - f interface or the s - f - s josephson junction has been experimentally confirmed by observing the structure of the energy gap@xcite or @xmath6 transition of josephson effect.@xcite nevertheless , it is shown that although there exists triplet pairings , no triplet order parameter arises in both the interface of conventional s - f and the system with soc in proximity to conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors.@xcite as a consequence , the elementary excitation spectra can not be influenced by the triplet pairings , and are only determined by the singlet order parameter .",
    "furthermore , in the interface of conventional s - f , in the ferromagnet side , when the singlet order parameter can be neglected due to the weak interaction potential , the system shows gapless structure.@xcite due to the gapless structure , the experimental realization of the gapless triplet superconductivity is performed at extremely low temperature due to the absence of the gap protection .",
    "one further notes that in above _ metal _ systems with the zeeman field or soc which are in proximity to the @xmath0-wave superconductors , the e - e interaction can be neglected due to the strong screening.@xcite nevertheless , in the study of the boundary effects in superconductors - normal metal , de gennes pointed out that the cooper pairs tunneling or diffusing from the @xmath0-wave superconductor also experience the many - body interaction in the normal metal , in which the singlet order parameter can be induced even with a _ repulsive _ effective e - e interaction.@xcite accordingly , it is natural to consider the possibility to realize the triplet order parameter in system with the zeeman field or soc in proximity to the @xmath0-wave superconductor from the effective e - e interaction , which can protect the ground state and is promising to provide rich physics especially for the elementary excitation .",
    "as expected , this effect is significant only when the effective e - e interaction is strong .",
    "this can be realized in low - dimensional semiconductors with weak screening effect , based on the facts that the proximity - induced superconductivity from @xmath0-wave superconductor in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas , including inas@xcite and gaas@xcite heterostructures , and quantum nanowire@xcite has been reported in the literature .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that a _ gapped _ triplet superconductivity with triplet order parameter can be realized in 2d electron gas of the spin - orbit - coupled quantum wells ( qws ) in proximity to the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "this triplet order parameter is induced by the effective e - e interaction including the coulomb and electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions , even the total interactions are repulsive .",
    "specifically , based on the superconducting proximity effect , it has been shown that the singlet order parameter can be induced in the 2d electron gas.@xcite with this proximity - induced singlet order parameter , it can be further shown that the triplet pairings are induced due to the soc.@xcite furthermore , we derive the effective bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , in which the self - energy due to the _ momentum - dependent _ e - e and e - p interactions is presented explicitly.@xcite specifically , in the effective bdg equation , the self - energy from the effective e - e interaction leads to the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath2 ) triplet order parameter .",
    "moreover , from the effective bdg equation , it is discovered that the proximity - induced singlet order parameter is also inevitably renormalized by the effective e - e interactions .    to make the physics clearer",
    ", we further carry out the numerical calculation in the specific material insb ( 100 ) qws , in which there exists strong soc.@xcite the calculations show that the self - energy due to the e - p interaction is much smaller than that due to the e - e coulomb interaction at low temperature ( @xmath72  k ) , and hence only the coulomb interaction needs to be considered here . for the renormalized singlet order parameter ,",
    "it is always smaller than the proximity - induced one , as the renormalization from the coulomb interaction is in the opposite sign against the proximity - induced order parameter .",
    "moreover , it is shown that it only depends on the magnitude of the momentum , and decreases with the increase of the energy due to the suppression of the coulomb interaction at high energy .",
    "for the induced triplet order parameter , it depends not only on the magnitude of the momentum , but also on its angle .",
    "specifically , in the momentum - module dependence , a _",
    "peak _ is predicted from our theory . in the angular dependence",
    ", it is proved that the @xmath5-vector of this triplet order parameter is parallel to the effective magnetic field due to the soc , and hence is protected by the soc.@xcite finally , we study the electron density dependencies of the singlet and triplet order parameters in detail .",
    "rich behaviors arise when the electrons populate different energy bands , which are split by the strong soc .",
    "it is further found that with proper electron density ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , the minimum of the renormalized singlet order parameter and the maximum of the induced triplet order parameter are comparable , which provides an ideal condition to observe and distinguish these order parameters in the experiment .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "therefore , it is the joint effects of the soc and singlet order parameter that cause the efficient suppression of the coulomb screening here . actually , the singlet order parameter alone can also suppress the coulomb screening .",
    "nevertheless , it is not obvious in the weak coupling limit when @xmath256 is much smaller than the fermi energy , but significant when @xmath256 is large . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figyw8 ] , we show that when @xmath260 , compared to the case with @xmath257 , the screening with @xmath261  mev represented by the black chain curve shows that @xmath258 is significantly suppressed at low electron density .      r. meservey and p. m. tedrow , phys . rep . *",

    "<S> specifically , we derive the effective bogoliubov - de gennes equation , in which the self - energies due to the effective electron - electron interactions contribute to the singlet and triplet order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is further shown that for the singlet order parameter , it is efficiently suppressed due to this self - energy renormalization ; whereas for the triplet order parameter , it is the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath2 ) one with the @xmath3-vector parallel to the effective magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling . finally , we perform the numerical calculation in insb ( 100 ) quantum wells . specifically , we reveal that the coulomb interaction is much more important than the electron - phonon interaction at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it shows that with proper electron density , the minimum of the renormalized singlet and the maximum of the induced triplet order parameters are comparable , and hence can be experimentally distinguished . </S>"
