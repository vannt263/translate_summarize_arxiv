    "work to date has concentrated mainly on deriving corrections to the standard 4d result by assuming that 5d metric perturbations generated by the inflaton perturbations can be neglected .",
    "then the modification of spectrum is coming from the modified friedmann equation .",
    "although a lot of interesting results have been obtained in this direction @xcite , it remains to see the consistency of neglecting the bulk metric perturbations .",
    "the analysis of the evolution of gravitational waves in this model has revealed that the creation of massive graviton modes in the bulk is as important as the modification of the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "in fact , these two higher - dimensional effects cancel out to give a nearly identical spectrum with the conventional 4d models for the stochastic background of gravitational waves in the radiation dominated universe @xcite .",
    "this highlights the importance of taking into account the higher - dimensional effects consistently .",
    "the study of the effects of bulk metric perturbations has been initiated in ref .",

    "@xcite tried to estimate the effects of the backreaction of bulk metric perturbations . assuming that the inflaton field behaves in the same ways as 4d models on sufficiently small scales at the 0-th order of slow - roll parameters , the corrections to the evolution of inflaton perturbations at the first order of slow - roll parameters",
    "were calculated .",
    "unlike in 4d models where the slow - roll corrections can be completely ignored on sub - horizon scales , the slow - roll corrections play a role even on sub - horizon scales , yielding the change of the amplitude at a horizon crossing",
    ". this result may not be so surprising as the bulk metric perturbations are strongly coupled to inflaton perturbations on small scales where gravity becomes 5d .",
    "however , this indicates that we should carefully check the validity of using the 4d formula just by modifying the background friedmann equations .",
    "this paper focuses on the classical evolution of inflaton perturbations coupled to bulk metric perturbations .",
    "we do not assume de sitter geometry on the brane and we take into account the backreaction of inflaton dynamics consistently .",

    "the quantity @xmath102 is first transformed into the tchebychev space through the relation , @xmath103 where we set @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",

    "satisfying eq.([eq : mukhanov_sasaki_equation ] ) , we use adams - bashforth - moulton method with the predictor - corrector scheme .",
    "further technical details of the numerical scheme is summarized in the appendix of ref .  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : junction-2 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : junction ] ) . at the regulator brane",
    ", we use a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath110 this is because the analysis in de sitter brane background @xcite suggests that the inflaton fluctuation excites the bound states that decays quickly away from the brane .",

    "( [ eq : mukhanov_sasaki_equation ] ) . in order to obtain the appropriate initial conditions for @xmath109",
    ", we again need a quantisation of the coupled system of the inflaton perturbations on a brane and 5d metric perturbations in the bulk .",
    "the aim of this paper is to check whether we can neglect @xmath83 on small scales or not .",
    "if this term could be neglected on the small scales , the quantity @xmath113 would behave just as plane waves with a constant amplitude as in the standard 4d cases .",

    "if the solutions for the coupled equations agree with 4d solutions , we can assume that the inflaton perturbation behaves as a free massless field without taking into account the effect of 5d metric perturbations , which is the assumption made in literatures .    for this purpose ,",
    "we take the simplest possible initial conditions for @xmath115 and then specify initial conditions for @xmath109 so that they are consistent with the junction condition ( [ eq : junction ] ) .",

    "then the time - derivative of @xmath109 is determined from the junction condition ( [ eq : junction ] ) .",
    "note that our initial conditions do not give standard qunatum vacuum state for 4d solutions .",
    "they are merely references to see the effects of @xmath83 on a classical evolution of @xmath109 .",
    "we solve numerically the wave equation for the bulk metric perturbations ( [ eq : master_equation ] ) in the gn coordinates with the junction condition ( [ eq : junction ] ) supplemented by the evolution equation for inflaton perturbations ( [ eq : mukhanov_sasaki_equation ] ) .",
    "we set the parameter of the hawkins - lidsey model as @xmath119 and the initial time for the simulations as @xmath120 . at the initial time , the hubble scale is given by @xmath121 thus we are considering high - energy region @xmath122 .",
    "the observable is the comoving curvature perturbation defined by @xmath123 we focus on the dynamics of this quantity .",
    "[ fig : full_r ] shows the behaviour of curvature perturbations for @xmath124 which corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "the curvature perturbations @xmath126 becomes constant on super - horizon scales , which has been shown to be valid even in brane world models @xcite . on sub - horizon scales , while @xmath127 in the 4d cosmology , a suppression of the amplitude is observed in the brane - world model , which is due to the coupling to the bulk metric perturbations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_ar ] , we compare the amplitude of @xmath126 obtained in numerical simulations with the one obtained by neglecting the coupling to the bulk metric perturbations , i.e. @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mukhanov_sasaki_equation ] ) .",
    "while the difference is very small for the long - wavelength modes ( left panel ; @xmath128 ) , the suppression becomes significant for the short - wavelength modes ( right panel ; @xmath129 ) . due to this , the spectrum of @xmath130 just before the horizon crossing acquires a scale dependence as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "perturbations with larger wavenumber stay on sub - horizon scales for a longer time than those with smaller wavenumber , so they receive more suppression .    the suppression of the amplitude @xmath131 under horizon may be understood as the excitation of metric perturbations .",
    "the suppression of the amplitude of @xmath80 is transferred into the enhancement of the metric perturbations @xmath51 in the bulk , which is shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : full_omega ] .",
    "here we comment on the reason why we evaluated @xmath131 just before the horizon crossing . in the 4d case",
    ", we can choose the bunch - davis vacuum as an initial condition .",
    "hence we can determine the amplitude and phase of the inflaton perturbations and obtain the spectrum of @xmath131 without any ambiguities .",
    "on the contrary , in the present 5d case , the initial conditions can not be determined without quantising the coupled system . even in the classical level",
    ", the junction condition ( [ eq : junction-2 ] ) or ( [ eq : junction ] ) restricts our choice of the initial conditions .",
    "on superhorizon scales , the initial phase of the perturbations essentially determines its final amplitude after the horizon crossing because the phase determines the amplitude of the growing mode solution on large scales .",
    "then we get an unphysical k - dependence of the curvature perturbations evaluated on superhorizon scales due to the restricted choice of @xmath132 for given @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial phase is not important when we evaluate the amplitude of the curvature perturbations on small scales .",
    "our aim is to see how @xmath83 term changes the amplitude of @xmath80 in comparison with the 4d solution for various @xmath133 on small scales .",
    "therefore we chose to calculate the spectrum below the horizon scales .      in this section",
    ", we first check the assumption of introducing a regulator .",
    "as expected from the previous work , @xmath51 decays fast away from the brane as is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : full_omega ] .",
    "this justifies the use of boundary condition @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , thanks to this behaviour of @xmath51 , the evolution of the curvature perturbations does not depend on the location of the regulator .",
    "in fact , even at late times when the information from the regulator brane comes into the brane , the behaviour of the curvature perturbations does not change .",
    "thus our result is not obscured by the regulator brane nor the existence of the coordinate singularity of the gn coordinate .",
    "finally , we check the accuracy of our numerical simulations by checking the constraint equations derived from the einstein equations .",
    "these equations can be generally expressed as @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is a set of their coefficients .",

    "<S> we find that the inflaton perturbations at high energies are strongly coupled to the bulk metric perturbations even on subhorizon scales , leading to the suppression of the amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbations at a horizon crossing . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the linear perturbations of the inflaton field does not obey the usual 4d klein - gordon equation due to the coupling to 5d gravitational field on small scales and it is required to quantise the coupled brane - bulk system in a consistent way in order to calculate the spectrum of the scalar perturbations in a brane - world inflation . </S>"
