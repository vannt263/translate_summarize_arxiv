    "in contrast to this , there is a group of class 0 protostars that exhibit one order of magnitude slower envelope rotations than other class 0 protostars on a 1000 au scale , suggesting that their radii of keplerian disks are likely less than 10 au ( brinch et al .",

    "these results show that class 0 and i protostars clearly exhibit a wide range of disk sizes .",
    "it is , therefore , still unclear as to when and how keplerian disks form and grow to those larger - than-100 au disks seen around young stellar objects .",
    "keplerian disks are expected to form when collapsing material rotates fast enough to become centrifugally supported ( e.g. , terebey et al .",
    "conventionally , keplerian disks are expected to grow in size as the collapse proceeds because more angular momentum is transferred to the disk - forming region due to the conservation of angular momentum . in the inside - out collapse model of non - magnetized rigid rotating dense cores ,",
    "the radius of a keplerian disk grows @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total mass of the star+disk systems ( terebey et al .",
    "1984 ) . in the model",
    "considering dense core formation in magnetized rigid rotating clouds , the initial radial profile of angular velocity ( @xmath13 ) approaches @xmath14 , as the dense cores become supercritical ( basu & mouschovias 1994 ) .",
    "the collapse of these dense cores then proceeds conserving angular momentum , and the radius of the keplerian disk grows @xmath15 ( basu 1998 ) . on the other hand , ideal magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of the collapse of dense cores , that initially exhibit aligned rotational and magnetic field axes ,",
    "show that the magnetic field efficiently removes angular momentum from the collapsing material via magnetic braking , and thus , no keplerian disks larger than 10 au can form ( e.g. , allen et al .  2003 ; mellon & li 2008 ) .",
    "that contradicts , at least , some observations that show an increasing number of keplerian disks with radii larger than tens of au . to reduce the efficiency of magnetic braking , simulations additionally consider non - ideal mhd effects , dissipation of protostellar envelopes , initially misaligned rotational axis and magnetic field , more realistic treatment of ionization degrees , or turbulence ( e.g. , hennebelle & ciardi 2009 ; li et al .",

    "several of these simulations show that keplerian disks with tens of au in size can form in magnetized dense cores . however , it is still unknown which mechanisms play a more important or possibly dominating role in the process of disk formation and growth .",
    "observations revealing the evolution of disk sizes are essential to shed light on which mechanisms are dominant .",
    "the current observational results suggest that ( 1 ) there is likely an evolutionary trend from slow , to fast , and to keplerian rotation on a scale of hundreds of au around class 0 and i protostars ( e.g. , yen et al .",
    "2013 ) , and ( 2 ) protostars having higher masses tend to exhibit larger keplerian disks ( e.g. , harsono et al .  2014",
    "; aso et al .",
    "these results support a scenario where gradually more angular momentum is transferred to the inner envelope and disk - forming region as collapse proceeds .",
    "however , the efficiency of the angular momentum transfer remains unclear .",

    "this can be suggestive of magnetic braking .",
    "as disk formation and evolution are closely related to the angular momentum transfer in the protostellar envelopes , it is essential to probe the gas kinematics from large to small scales and the disk sizes around protostars at different evolutionary stages .    in order to investigate the gas kinematics at an early evolutionary stage and the formation of keplerian disks , we have conducted alma observations toward three candidate young protostars , lupus 3 mms , iras 15398@xmath23559 , and iras 16253@xmath22429 .",

    "assuming all the luminosity in lupus 3 mms ( @xmath17 = 0.41 @xmath18 ) is from the gravitational energy released by the accretion onto the protostar , its mass accretion rate ( @xmath134 ) can be estimated as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the protostellar radius , adopted to be 3 @xmath137 ( stahler et al .",
    "1980 ) and @xmath8 is the protostellar mass .",
    "@xmath134 in lupus 3 mms is then 1 @xmath20 10@xmath138 @xmath4 yr@xmath22 . unless lupus 3 mms is in a quiescent accretion phase , at this rate it can only gain 0.1 @xmath4 more ( @xmath330% of the current mass ) over the class 0/i stage ( @xmath510@xmath60 yr ; enoch et al .",
    "it would then become a low - mass 0.4 @xmath4 star .",
    "there is also a possibility that the opposite velocity gradient observed on a 1000 au scale in lupus 3 mms is due to counter - rotation of the protostellar envelope .",
    "theoretically , counter - rotating envelopes surrounding keplerian disks can be caused by the hall effect , which spins up disk - forming regions while it spins down surrounding material ( krasnopolsky et al .",
    "2011 ; li et al .  2011 ; tsukamoto et al .  2015 ; tsukamoto 2016 ) .",
    "this can reduce the efficiency of magnetic braking and enable the formation of keplerian disks .",
    "recent mhd simulations show that counter - rotating envelopes generated by the hall effect can have radii larger than 200 au ( tsukamoto et al .",
    "2015 ) , comparable to the scale of the opposite velocity gradient in lupus 3 mms .",
    "if we assume that the surrounding envelope observed with the sma is indeed counter - rotating around the 100 au disk , its specific angular momentum is 9 @xmath20 10@xmath21 km s@xmath22 pc from our kinematic models ( appendix [ smapv ] ) .",
    "this is comparable to the specific angular momentum at the disk radius .",
    "thus , the hall effect can explain the disk formation in lupus 3 mms . nevertheless , due to the limited angular resolution and signal - to - noise ratio of the sma data , the density and velocity structures on the 1000 au scale are not yet well resolved .",
    "no clear signature of infall and envelope rotation ( along the same direction as the disk rotation ) in the sma data can also be due to asymmetric structures ( if present ) on a 1000 au scale .",
    "the projected velocity features might then not represent infall and rotation .",
    "short - baseline data are needed to better unveil the gas kinematics on the 1000 au scale around lupus 3 mms .",

    "the similarity between profiles from observations and the inside - out collapse model supports the scenario where the fast infalling region expands as the expansion wave of collapse propagates outward , and that more angular momentum is transferred to the inner 1001000 au region with the proceeding collapse .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the flat angular momentum profiles in these sample sources and the smooth connection from the envelope to the disk rotation seen in l1551 irs 5 , hh 212 , and l1527 could suggest that there is no efficient magnetic braking on scales within several hundred au .",

    "such a decrease in the specific angular momentum inside the region exhibiting a flat angular momentum profile is not observed in the other younger protostars in this sample .",
    "however , since the number of protostars in this sample is limited , it is not yet fully clear whether the difference between hh 111 and the younger protostars is due to evolution or different physical conditions in hh 111 .      to investigate the evolution of size of keplerian disks around protostars , we compile a list of resolved keplerian disks around class 0 and i protostars ( table [ sample ] ) , including our alma results of lupus 3 mms , and plot their disk radii and protostellar masses measured from keplerian rotation in figure [ rd ] .",
    "we also compare these measurements with our alma results of iras 15398@xmath23559 , iras 16253@xmath22429 , and b335 ( figure [ rd ] ) . although the keplerian disks around these three protostars were not resolved with our alma observations , based on the outflow / jet launching models ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "2000 ; shang et al .  2006 ; machida & hosokawa 2013 ; machida 2014 ) , they most likely possess at least au - scale keplerian disks or precursors of disks ( e.g. , first cores ) because they are all associated with outflows and/or jets .",
    "we have estimated their protostellar masses and inferred their disk radii based on the infall and rotation of their protostellar envelopes .",
    "these estimates provide a constraint on radii of keplerian disks at an early evolutionary stage when the protostellar mass is less than 0.1 @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ rd ] shows that the radii of the resolved keplerian disks around class i and 0 protostars are comparable ( blue diamonds and red squares ) .",
    "nevertheless , large disks , such as those around the class i protostars irs 43 and l1489 irs , have not yet been seen around class 0 protostars .",
    "hence , these results possibly hint that disks continue to grow in size when @xmath143 @xmath4 . to investigate the evolutionary trend of the disk sizes , we fitted a power - law function to the data points of resolved keplerian disks .",
    "the typical uncertainties in protostellar masses estimated from keplerian rotation are 20%30% ( e.g. , lommen et al .",
    "2008 ; tobin et al .",
    "2012a , yen et al .  2014 ; aso et al .  2015 ) , while the uncertainties in estimated disk radii are related to the relative size between the keplerian disks and the angular resolutions ( aso et al .",

    "fitting , we adopt 30% uncertainties in both the protostellar masses and the disk radii for all the data points , and we obtain @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the disk radius . in addition , the range of disk radii around class 0 and i protostars  from tens to hundreds of au  is also comparable to that around t tauri or herbig ae / be stars ( e.g. , simon et al .",
    "2000 ; pitu et al .",
    "these results are different from the expectation from the collapse models , where @xmath146 or @xmath147 ( assuming @xmath148 ; terebey et al .  1984 ; basu 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , disk radii seem to more gradually increase with a growing protostellar mass , but not as rapidly as expected in the collapse model , and they possibly continue to grow through a transition from the class 0 to i stage .",
    "there are two possible scenarios to explain the slow disk growth after @xmath149 @xmath4 .",
    "one is that the angular momentum in the outer regions ( @xmath150 a few thousand au ) of their parental dense cores is lower than the expectation in the collapse models , where @xmath151 or @xmath152 ( terebey et al .",
    "1984 ; basu 1998 ) .",
    "thus , when the outer region starts to collapse at a later evolutionary stage , the collapsing material does not carry a large amount of angular momentum toward the center , and the disk can not grow in size rapidly .",
    "furthermore , close to the end of the main accretion phase , the mass infalling rate likely declines ( e.g. , beltrn & de wit 2016 ) , and the mass reservoir is mostly already consumed or starts to dissipate , as in the case of the class i protostar l1489 irs ( yen et al .",
    "2014 ) . therefore",
    ", no sufficient angular momentum is available to further grow the disk size at the later evolutionary stage .",
    "the second possibility is that the angular momentum transferred by the collapsing material is removed by magnetic braking .",
    "hints of this removal of angular momentum are observed in hh 111 . in this source , the specific angular momentum of the outer envelope at a radius larger than 2000",
    "au is comparable to the expectation from the collapse model ( fig .",
    "however , the specific angular momentum starts to drop with decreasing radii , and the observed disk radius is only 160 au ( lee et al .",
    "that disk radius is almost an order of magnitude smaller than expected assuming angular momentum conservation within 2000 au .",
    "this magnetic braking effect can suppress disk growth and therefore , limit the disk size .",
    "nevertheless , the signs of efficient magnetic braking , as seen in hh 111 , have not been observed in the younger class 0 and i protostars with resolved keplerian disks , such as l1527 , hh 212 , and l1551 irs 5 ( fig .",
    "[ jr ] ) . all together",
    ", this could suggest that magnetic braking is less of an initial condition that allows or does not allow the formation of a disk , but more of a regulatory mechanism that can control size and growth rate during the evolution of a keplerian disk .",
    "our alma observations find two more candidate protostars exhibiting very small keplerian disks , in addition to our previous alma results of b335 . in iras 15398@xmath23559 ,",
    "the disk radius is estimated to be @xmath520 au , and in iras 16253@xmath22429 @xmath510 au .",
    "there is an order of magnitude difference in disk radii between these protostars and those exhibiting resolved keplerian disks .",
    "one possibility is that there are two distinct groups of protostars that have different physical conditions , which then results in a bimodal distribution of disk radii .",
    "for example , mhd simulations show that the hall effect can spin up the disk - forming region and form a large disk if the directions of the magnetic field and the rotational axis are antiparallel , while it suppresses disk formation if the two directions are parallel ( e.g. , tsukamoto et al .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that the radii of keplerian disks around protostars can differ by one order of magnitude because of different directions of the magnetic field , and consequently they suggest that there can be a bimodal distribution of disk radii ( tsukamoto et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the inferred protostellar masses ( @xmath50.1 @xmath4 ) of these protostars with small disks , are all lower than those having resolved keplerian disks with radii beyond tens of au . besides , the protostars having small disks ( iras 15398@xmath23559 , iras 16253@xmath22429 , and b335 ) and those having larger disks ( l1527 , hh 212 , and l1551 irs 5 ) exhibit similar angular momentum profiles .",
    "their profiles can be explained with the simple collapse model ( fig .  [ jr ] ) .",
    "hence , the difference in their disk radii could also be an evolutionary effect , and disks can continue to grow in size as more angular momentum is transferred inward with proceeding collapse . by fitting a power - law function to the data points of only the class 0 protostars , we obtain @xmath153 since no keplerian rotation is detected in iras 15398@xmath23559 , iras 16253@xmath22429 , and b335 , their protostellar masses estimated from the infalling motions are only lower limits , while the radii of their keplerian disks are upper limits . in the class 0 protostar l1527 , the infall velocity is only 50% of the free - fall velocity ( ohashi et al .",
    "if that is also the case in these three protostars , their protostellar masses are underestimated by a factor of four . with a given angular momentum ,",
    "the radius of a keplerian disk is inversely proportional to its central stellar mass .",
    "thus , the disk radii in these three protostars can be a factor of four smaller ( e.g. , yen et al .",
    "2015a ) . in this fitting",
    ", we adopt a monte carlo method to estimate the uncertainties in the fitting results .",
    "we repeated the fitting for a 1000 times .",
    "each time we randomly increased the protostellar masses of iras 15398@xmath23559 , iras 16253@xmath22429 , and b335 by a factor of one to four , and decreased their disk radii by the same factor .",
    "other data points of resolved keplerian disks were randomly varied within their 30% uncertainties . with the 1000 iterations , the probability distributions of the fitting parameters converged , and we adopted the means and 1@xmath82 widths of them as the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "this fitted @xmath145@xmath8 relation ( eq .",
    "[ rd0 ] ) is comparable to that in the collapse model in basu ( 1998 ) but shallower than the one in terebey et al .",
    "the deviation between the observed relation and these two collapse models could suggest that : ( 1 ) the angular momentum of the collapsing material in our sample protostars is not conserved but partially removed during the collapse , different from the model assumption , or ( 2 ) the angular momentum profiles of the dense cores in this sample are shallower than @xmath151 or @xmath152 in the collapse models .",
    "furthermore , based on our sample , the @xmath145@xmath8 relation derived from the class 0 protostars ( eq .  [ rd0 ] ) is clearly steeper than that from the class 0 and i protostars whose @xmath149 @xmath4 ( eq .  [ rd01 ] ) . if our sample protostars are representative to probe the various evolutionary stages , these results likely suggest that keplerian disks grow rapidly from @xmath510 au to tens of au when protostellar masses increase from @xmath50.1 @xmath4 to @xmath30.2 @xmath4 . after that , in the later evolutionary stage , rapid disk growth is suppressed .",
    "however , the number of the protostars with @xmath154 @xmath155 in our sample is only three . a larger sample in the low - mass regime is required to reveal the genuine @xmath145@xmath8 relation and the trend of disk growth .    in the conventional collapse models in terebey",

    "we first derive the age of each protostar from its protostellar mass and mass accretion rate with equation [ tage ] on the assumption of constant mass accretion rates , even though some observations have shown that the mass accretion rate declines with evolution ( e.g. , beltrn & de wit 2016 ) and that it can be episodic ( e.g. , dunham et al .  2008 ; enoch et al .",

    "there is a clear trend of larger disk radii with growing age , and the mass accretion rate , indeed , appears to decline with age as expected . in a next step , in order to include this observed decline in accretion rate in our discussion , we assume that all the sample sources follow the same profile of mass accretion rate as a function of age . in other words , we assume that the sources in our sample are representative to probe the various evolutionary stages . for simplicity , this profile is assumed to be a power - law function as @xmath160 this assumption implies that the differences in protostellar masses in the sample sources are due to differences in age . in this picture ,",
    "differences in mass accretion rates of protostars with similar masses can then be associated with short - time bursts or quiescent phases of mass accretion , and the time - averaged accretion rate , smoothing out bursts and quiescent phases , is described by equation [ mt ] . with this , the protostellar mass can be computed by integrating equation [ mt ] as @xmath161 we fit equation [ mt ] to figure [ age]a to obtain an initial guess of @xmath162 and @xmath163 . with the derived @xmath162 and @xmath163 , we re - estimated the age of each protostar using equation [ ms ] to obtain a new distribution of @xmath164 versus @xmath156 .",

    "in addition , we assumed that the uncertainties in the bolometric luminosities are 15% ( e.g. , dunham et al .",

    "the narrow line width on a 1000 au scale could suggest that the infalling velocity in the 1000 au envelope is slower than the free - fall velocity , or that the envelope surrounding the disk is dissipating but not infalling .",
    "the opposite velocity gradient observed with the sma could indicate that the surrounding envelope is counter - rotating with respect to the keplerian disk seen with alma .",

    "<S> no 100 au keplerian disks are observed in iras 15398@xmath23559 and iras 16253@xmath22429 . </S>",

    "<S> iras 16253@xmath22429 exhibits signatures of infall and rotation , but its rotational profile is unresolved . by fitting the c@xmath1o data with our kinematic models , the protostellar masses and the disk radii are inferred to be 0.01 @xmath4 and 20 au in iras 15398@xmath23559 , and 0.03 @xmath4 and 6 au in iras 16253@xmath22429 . by comparing the specific angular momentum profiles from 10,000 to 100 au in 8 class 0 and i protostars , we find that the evolution of envelope rotation can be described with conventional inside - out collapse models . in comparison with a sample of 18 protostars with known disk radii , our results reveal signs of disk growth , with the disk radius increasing as @xmath6 or @xmath7 in the class 0 stage , where @xmath8 is the protostellar mass and @xmath9 is the age . </S>",
    "<S> the disk growth rate slows down in the class i stage . besides </S>",
    "<S> , we find a hint that the mass accretion rate declines as @xmath10 from the class 0 to i stages . </S>"
