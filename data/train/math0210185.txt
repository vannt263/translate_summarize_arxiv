    "the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology ( cf.@xmath1@xcite ) gives mathematical meaning ,  la gromov - witten theory , to the various invariants such as `` orbifold euler characteristic '' and `` orbifold cohomology '' for global quotient orbifolds that have been in use , courtesy of string theorists , for quite a while .",
    "the most interesting feature of this new cohomology theory , besides the generalization to non - global quotients , is the existence of a ring structure which was previously missing .",
    "the ring structure is obtained from chen - ruan s orbifold quantum cohomology construction ( cf.@xmath1@xcite ) by restricting to the class of maps called ghost maps , in the same spirit as the ordinary cup product may be recovered from quantum cup product .",
    "one of the motivations of chen and ruan was to construct a mathematical theory that is rich enough to formulate mirror symmetry for calabi - yau orbifolds without having to resort to their smooth crepant resolutions which do not always exist in dimensions higher than three .",
    "although the chen - ruan cohomology has had several successes , it is yet to make serious progress in this direction .",
    "one problem has been that the computation of the ring structure was an unsolved problem when the `` obstruction bundle '' is not trivial , which is indeed the case for the batyrev mirror families of hypersurfaces in fano toric varieties .",
    "here we try to rectify the situation by suggesting that the riemann bilinear relations for periods @xcite may be adequate to identify the obstruction bundle .",
    "although we do not prove this , we show that this is true in the mirror quintic example .",
    "we then proceed to give an explicit description of the ring structure for this example .",
    "the integral of the euler class of the obstruction bundle is computed first by an ad hoc method that is shorter but rather restrictive , and then recomputed by using localization techniques which should work for any toric calabi - yau hypersurface .",
    "we deliberately avoid making use of the fact that the mirror quintic is a global quotient .",
    "rather , we focus on developing a strategy that should work in the general setting . for instance",
    "the twisted sectors of the mirror quintic can be readily determined since it is a global quotient .",
    "however we obtained them as a special case of a more general theorem .",
    "we would like to point out that the computation of the ordinary cup product of ample toric hypersurfaces is made possible by recent results of mavlyutov @xcite and grbner basis method ( cf.@xmath1@xcite ) .    finally , we draw the reader s attention to a relevant conjecture of ruan .",
    "string theory suggests that the orbifold quantum cohomology ring of a calabi - yau orbifold should be isomorphic to the ordinary quantum cohomology ring of its crepant resolution .",
    "this is , of course , not easy to check .",
    "it is known that the chen - ruan ring structure is not preserved under ( partial ) crepant resolutions .",
    "but the cohomological crepant resolution conjecture ( cf.@xmath1@xcite ) specifies how the ordinary cup product of the crepant resolution may be deformed by using certain quantum corrections to make it equal to the orbifold cup product of the original space .",
    "developing the machinery to compute the gromov - witten invariants involved in these correction terms seems to be an interesting problem .",
    "the reader may find a parallel approach to stringy cohomolgy spaces in @xcite interesting as well .",
    "we thank alejandro adem , karl heinz dovermann , ronald fintushel , john mccarthy , yongbin ruan and jon wolfson for very helpful discussions and encouragements .",
    "we especially thank yongbin ruan for explaining to us how localization might be used to compute integral of the euler class of the obstruction bundle .",
    "the second author also benefitted from conversations with yuan - pin lee , ernesto lupercio and bernardo uribe .",
