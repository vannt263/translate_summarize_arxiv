    "@xmath1 production in hadronic collisions can occur in part through the production of higher excited resonances , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , which decay into the ground state . for @xmath1",
    "it is known experimentally that about 40% of hadroproduction rate comes from feed - down of higher mass resonances @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "measurement of excited charmonium states is of key importance to account for the feed - down contributions .",
    "thus , this is an aditional test for different production mechanisms of charmonium .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath1 peak , @xmath11 , is given by : @xmath12    i.e. the product of the cross section @xmath13 , the branching ratio into dilepton pairs @xmath14 , the integrated luminosity @xmath15 and the total reconstruction and trigger efficiencies , as well as acceptance @xmath16 .",
    "the luminosity is identical for all charmonium states , and therefore cancels in the ratios .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections in the @xmath17 channel , @xmath18 is equal to :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the leptonic decay channel , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 production cross section and @xmath23 is the branching ratio for the @xmath17 decay into the @xmath24 meson .",
    "the ratio @xmath25 or raw @xmath26 ratio is defined from the fit of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 signals and must be corrected by the efficiency ratio , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is defined above and @xmath29 is the corresponding efficiency for detection of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the efficiencies are evaluated by simulation as described in [ analysis ] .",
    "data collected during the 2006 rhic run with the phenix central arms spectrometers which cover @xmath30 0.35 in pseudorapidity and 2 @xmath312 in azimuth were used for this letter .",
    "electrons and positrons are reconstructed in the central arms @xcite using drift chambers ( dc ) and pad chambers ( pc ) , located outside an axial magnetic field , and are identified by hits in the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and by matching the momentum with the energy measured in an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "this analysis is based on collision events triggered by minimum activity in the beam beam counters at 3.0 @xmath32 3.9 ( minimum bias trigger ) , and associated hits between the rich and a 400 mev cluster in the emcal .",
    "the data sample cosisted of 88 billion minimum bias events .",
    "two sets of electron identification cuts were used to count @xmath1 and @xmath8 . a first set , named tight with a match between energy and momentum satisfying @xmath33 -3 standard deviations @xmath34 , interaction - vertex cut of @xmath430 cm .",
    "the second set , named loose with energy - momentum requirement ( e / p-1 ) @xmath35 -4@xmath36 , interaction - vertex cut of @xmath430 cm and a minimum number of dc hits used to reconstruct each track of the electron - positron pair .",
    "the number of @xmath1 candidates is obtained by counting the unlike sign pairs in the mass window ( 2.88 - 3.32 ) gev / c@xmath37 and the @xmath8 candidates in the mass window ( 3.48 - 3.92 ) gev / c@xmath37 .",
    "the combinatorial background subtraction is performed as the sum of the like sign pairs .",
    "the subtracted plot contains charmonium resonances and physical background made of correlated @xmath38 pairs from drell yan and leptonic decays of charm and bottom . from pythia",
    "the @xmath38 invariant mass distribution was obtained for all sources of physical background under the @xmath1 and @xmath8 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the resulting sum of all the three components was fit with a power law .    to count the number of @xmath1s and @xmath8s different fit procedures",
    "were applied for each one of the electron identification cuts .",
    "figure 2 shows a double gaussian shape for the @xmath1 peak , a single gaussian for @xmath8 .",
    "the background was fit with a power law , the @xmath1-@xmath8 mass difference was fixed with the particle data group value ( 0.589 gev/@xmath39 ) and both @xmath1 and @xmath8 widths varied independently . for this fit ,",
    "loose electron identification cuts set was applied .",
    "acceptance and reconstruction efficiency were calculated by generating @xmath1 and @xmath8 with pythia event generator and checking the response of phenix detector with a geant based monte carlo . in order to generate @xmath1",
    ", all @xmath1 decays were turned off except the dielectron one . to account for direct and indirect production ( through @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath8 decays ) the subprocesses reported on the left of table i were used .",
    "in order to generate @xmath8 particle id=100443 was requested , instead of 443 and all @xmath8 decay modes were turned off except the dielectron one plus the following on the right of table i.        j.h.cobb _ et al_. , phys.lett .",
