    "antiproton spectra have been measured by bess ( balloon - borne experiment with a superconducting spectrometer ) in a series of flights from lynn lake , canada providing reasonable statistics above 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "below 1 gev statistics are limited and the effects of solar modulation are greater .",
    "the spectrum has a distinct peak around 2 gev , showing the characteristic feature of secondary antiprotons produced by the interaction of galactic cosmic - rays with the interstellar medium .",
    "the energy spectrum of these secondary antiprotons should decrease rapidly toward lower energies reflecting the kinematic constraints on antiproton production  @xcite and toward higher energies reflecting the steep power - law spectra of primary particles producing the antiprotons .",
    "in addition to these secondary antiprotons , there might be a source of primary antiprotons .",
    "such sources have been suggested to result from the evaporation of primordial black holes ( pbh ) or from the annihilation of neutralino dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of antiprotons from a primary source might have a peak in the energy region below 1  gev , giving a flatter composite spectrum with excess flux compared to the purely secondary spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the influence of a low energy primary peak would be most evident at solar minimum  @xcite and bess ( 1995 + 1997 ) measurements during this period  @xcite suggested this possibility .",
    "on the other hand , bess-1998  @xcite and subsequent measurements  @xcite , which were taken after the solar minimum period , are more consistent with pure secondary nature . in order to resolve the important questions regarding possible novel sources",
    ", we undertook the higher precision measurements reported here .",
    "in addition , one can use the charge - sign difference of antiprotons to explore effects of drift in the solar modulation .",
    "a detailed understanding of the effects of solar modulation is important to establish the existence of any primary sources . during the positive polarity phase of solar activity before 2000",
    "the measured antiproton - to - proton ( p / p ) ratio  @xcite showed no distinctive variation .",
    "after the reversal of the solar magnetic field in 2000 , a sudden increase of the p / p ratio  @xcite was clearly observed .",
    "our measurements , as well as measurements of the positron fraction ( e@xmath0/(e@xmath0+e@xmath1 ) )  @xcite , generally support recent calculations  @xcite incorporating steady - state drift models and charge - dependent effects of solar modulation . protons and antiprotons have significantly different interstellar spectra and the drift directions are opposite because of the opposite charge sign .",
    "the combination of these effects implies that the p / p ratio should display a more interesting evolution  @xcite during 2000 - 2010 than it did during the 1990 s .",
    "the secondary antiprotons are also useful to probe the average cosmic - ray proton spectrum over a large region of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "the bess - polar experiment was proposed as an advanced bess program of long - duration balloon flights over antarctica and has been prepared since 2001  @xcite to further investigate elementary particle phenomena in the early universe through a precise measurement of the low - energy antiproton spectrum and to search for primary antinuclei in cosmic rays .",
    "we report here a measurement of the cosmic - ray antiproton spectrum based on  antiproton events detected during an 8.5-day flight of the bess - polar spectrometer performed in december 2004 .",
    "we discuss the origin of cosmic - ray antiprotons , and the solar modulation effect based on the measured p / p ratio .",
    "the bess - polar superconducting spectrometer , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrometer ] , has been developed to reduce material thickness along the particle trajectory and to meet the severe requirements for long duration balloon flights over antarctica  @xcite .",
    "the basic instrument concepts , such as the cylindrical configuration with an open and wide acceptance and redundant measurements for particle identification , are inherited from the bess spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "a very low instrumental energy cutoff for antiprotons was achieved with a new thin - walled ( 2.46  g/@xmath2/wall including cryostat ) superconducting magnet  @xcite using a new high - strength aluminum - stabilized superconductor .",
    "in addition , the outer pressure vessel was eliminated and the detectors were reconfigured .",
    "low - energy particles only have to traverse 4.5  g/@xmath2 of instrument material to be detected , about one quarter of that in the previous bess spectrometer  @xcite . with these changes ,",
    "the lowest energy for antiproton detection has been reduced to 0.1  gev at the top of atmosphere ( toa ) .    a uniform field of 0.8 tesla is produced by the superconducting coil , and its continuous operation is maintained for over 11 days with a 400-liter liquid helium reservoir . a jet - cell type drift chamber ( jet ) and",
    "two inner drift chambers ( idcs ) , which were also used in the bess - tev spectrometer  @xcite , are placed inside the warm bore ( 0.80  m in diameter and 1.4  m in length ) . the jet and idcs",
    "are filled with co@xmath3 gas , and fresh gas is circulated using a semi - active flow control system .",
    "tracking of an incident particle in the @xmath4 plane ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) inside the jet and idcs is performed by fitting up to 52 hit - points , each with 150 @xmath5 m resolution , resulting in a magnetic - rigidity ( @xmath6c@xmath7 , momentum divided by electric charge ) resolution of 0.4  % at 1 gv , and a maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) of 240 gv .",
    "tracking in the @xmath8 coordinate ( parallel to the magnetic field direction ) is done by fitting points inside idcs measured by vernier pads with an accuracy of 1.0  mm and points in jet measured by charge division with an accuracy of 37  mm .",
    "the continuous and redundant 3-dimensional tracking enables bess - polar to distinguish backgrounds such as tracks having interaction or scattering .",
    "a truncated mean of the integrated charges of the hit - pulses from the jet also provides an energy loss ( d@xmath9/d@xmath10 ) measurement with a resolution of 10  % .",
    "the top and bottom scintillator hodoscopes , the time - of - flight ( tof ) detectors , are used to determine the incident particle velocity , @xmath11 .",
    "they also make two independent d@xmath9/d@xmath10 measurements .",
    "the scintillator hodoscopes consist of 10 top and 12 bottom plastic scintillators with a cross section of 96.5  mm ( width ) @xmath12 10  mm ( thickness ) and with photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) attached by acrylic light guides at each end .",
    "the timing resolution of each hodoscope is 110 ps , resulting in a @xmath13 resolution of 3.3  % .",
    "in addition , a thin scintillator middle - tof ( mtof ) is installed on the lower surface of the solenoid bore to detect low energy particles which can not penetrate the magnet wall .",
    "the mtof consists of 64 plastic scintillator bars with a cross section of 10  mm ( width ) @xmath12 5  mm ( thickness ) read by multi - anode pmts .",
    "the @xmath14 of the low energy antiprotons can be measured as a combination of top - middle tof with a @xmath13 resolution of 4.5  % below 0.6  gv ( 0.2  gev for proton and antiproton ) .",
    "a erenkov counter with silica - aerogel radiator ( acc ) is installed below the magnet .",
    "the radiator is selected to have a refractive index of 1.02 in order to veto @xmath15 backgrounds up to 4.2 gev .",
    "the top and bottom tof hodoscopes and the acc operate at ambient pressure .",
    "the event data acquisition sequence is initiated by a coincidence of signals in the top - bottom tof or top - middle tof hodoscopes  @xcite . based on digitized detector information sent from the front - end electronics ,",
    "the event data are built and recorded to onboard hard disk drives with a total capacity of 3.5 tera bytes . during the antarctic flight , the data acquisition rate was around 1.4  khz , and the dead time was 150 @xmath5s per event ( 20  % of the data - taking time ) .",
    "to supply electric power to the electronics onboard the payload , a solar cell array of 900  w capacity was mounted on an omni - directional octagonal frame around the payload .",
    "the total power consumption of the spectrometer was 420  w.",
    "the first bess - polar long duration balloon flight over antarctica was launched from williams field ( @xmath16s , @xmath17e ) near mcmurdo station on december 13 , 2004  @xcite . during the flight , some pmts of the tof hodoscopes had to be turned off because they were drawing excessive current , and the usable geometrical acceptance was consequently reduced to 73  % of the design value ( 0.157  m@xmath18sr at 0.2  gev and 0.166  m@xmath18sr at 2.0  gev ) .",
    "the flight was terminated on december 21 and the payload landed at the south end of the ross ice shelf ( @xmath19s , @xmath20w ) after a continuous observation period of 8.5  days .",
    "the flight trajectory was close enough to the south magnetic pole that the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity was below 0.2  gv , lower than the lowest detection limit of the spectrometer . during the live data - taking time of 507,075 seconds at an average floating altitude of 38.5  km ( residual atmosphere of 4.3  g/@xmath2 ) , 894,482,590 cosmic - ray events were accumulated without any online event selection as 2.14 terabytes of data recorded on the hard disk drives .",
    "since the spectrometer is cylindrically symmetric , it may be assumed that antiprotons behave exactly like protons in the instrument except for the sign of their deflection in the magnetic field and their inelastic interactions .",
    "thus , all the selection criteria were defined based on the measured properties of protons .",
    "initially , events were selected with ( 1 ) a single track and a downward - going particle fully contained in the fiducial region of the tracking volume , ( 2 ) only one or two hits each in the top and bottom tof hodoscopes , ( 3 ) the hit position at the tof hodoscopes consistent with the extrapolated track inside the jet and idcs , ( 4 ) cosine of zenith angle of the incident particle larger than 0.8 , and ( 5 ) either top or bottom tof hodoscopes read by pmts at both ends . as a consequence of ( 5 ) , the effective geometrical acceptance had to be further reduced to be 40  % of the design value .",
    "the selection efficiency was estimated using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation by applying the same selection criteria to the simulated events as to the observed data . the mc simulation was based on a geant3/gheisha code  @xcite and tuned to reproduce the results of an accelerator beam test of the previous bess spectrometer  @xcite in which the detector configuration and materials are similar to the bess - polar spectrometer . the efficiency varied from 84.2@xmath215.0  % at 0.2  gev to 90.1@xmath215.0  % at 2.0  gev .",
    "the systematic error of the efficiency was determined using the accelerator beam test data .",
    "each analog - to - digital board for tof has an individual dead time due to the period of switching reference capacitors used for baseline subtraction .",
    "events digitized during the dead time have incorrect charge data and were rejected to ensure the quality of the data .",
    "the efficiency of surviving this cut was estimated as 77.8@xmath210.1  % at 0.2  gev and 78.8@xmath210.1  % at 2.0  gev . here and in the selections described below",
    ", a sample of the proton data has been used to determine the efficiencies .",
    "the following track quality cuts were applied : ( 1 ) the reduced @xmath22 in the @xmath10@xmath23 and @xmath23@xmath8 track fitting to be less than 5 , ( 2 ) the fitting error on the curvature ( inverse rigidity ) to be less than 0.015  gv@xmath24 , ( 3 ) the track fitting path length to be longer than 500  mm , and ( 4 ) the residual between hit position at tof obtained from the time difference in two pmts and the extrapolated track of the jet to be less than 50  mm .",

    "because of the relativistic rise of d@xmath9/d@xmath10 in the jet gas , ultra - relativistic particles ( @xmath321 ) have d@xmath9/d@xmath10 about 1.4 times higher than minimum ionizing particles .",

    "the estimated number of background events ( and the ratio to antiproton candidates ) was 18.7@xmath210.3 ( 8.5@xmath210.1  % ) in the 1.72.1  gev band and 8.1@xmath210.1 ( 4.0@xmath210.1  % ) in the 3.44.2  gev band . in the region -1.5",

    "to analyze such low energy events , we defined another set of selection criteria with a combination of the top and middle tof hodoscopes .",

    "such events were rejected by applying the following cuts : ( 1 ) stopping antiprotons can not generate high energy secondaries because of the kinematical restriction . hence for this search rigidities of all the tracks inside the jet",
    "were required to be less than 1  gv .",
    "( 2 ) it was required that the distance between the two tracks at the top tof to be larger than 150  mm .",

    "a total of 31 multi - track antiproton candidates were found , but all of them were rejected by the cuts . according to the mc study , the total antiproton detection efficiency was increased by 11.1  % at 0.1  gev by accepting multi - track events .",
    "this increase was treated as a systematic error , but it was smaller than the statistical error ( + 41  % /34  % ) of single - track antiproton candidates below 0.2  gev .      after the antiproton candidates were identified , energy - dependent corrections were applied for backgrounds and detection efficiency .",
    "then the absolute flux at the top of the instrument ( toi ) was obtained by taking account of energy loss inside the spectrometer , live time , and geometrical acceptance .",
    "the energy of each particle at toi was calculated by summing up the ionization energy losses inside the instrument as determined by tracing back the event trajectory .",

    "the expected signal from the pbh is modulated more than the secondary antiproton spectrum because of its spectral shape having the peak in the low energy region .",
    "while the bess(95 + 97 ) data were suggestive of an excess flux at energies below 400 mev , we do not find further evidence in the new bess - polar data presented here , even with the extended energy range .",
