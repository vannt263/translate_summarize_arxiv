    "moreover , even assuming some vacuum concept , to treat only one gluon field it is necessary to take into account more than 30 invariants , and all that becomes a typical problem of statistical physics , with specific technical approaches , such as monte carlo simulation ( lattice qcd ) .",

    "as it is known at high energies the number of partial waves is large , and one way to circumvent that is to transform the sum of partial waves into a complex integral , and then use the residues theorem to obtain a new sum , but involving only the number of residues :    @xmath53    detailed calculation allows one to obtain the following representation for the scattering amplitude ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is called the background integral . by considering the high - energy limit ( then @xmath56 ) and crossing ( exchange four - momenta @xmath57 )",

    "the interaction of the colliding particles is basically interpreted in terms of exchanges of regge poles ( also regge cuts ) and the pomeron ( an _ ad hoc _ trajectory with intercept nearly above 1 ) .",

    "we review some results obtained through this approach .",
    "we start with the replacement of the above integral forms by derivative operators ( derivative dispersion relations ) and then we discuss the use of analytic models ( reggeons , pomeron , odderon ) for parametrizations involving the total cross section and the @xmath13 parameter , the determination of bounds for the soft pomeron intercept , and the practical role of the subtraction constant .    in what follows we",
    "are mainly concerned with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 elastic scattering , since for particle and antiparticle interactions they correspond to the highest energy interval with available data and are the only set including the cosmic - ray information on total cross sections ( @xmath3 scattering ) . as commented before , the experimental data available on the total cross sections ( figure 1 )",
    "are characterized by discrepant experimental information at the highest energies , and one of our aims is to investigate the effects of these discrepancies in the context of the analytic models .",
    "this concern permeates all the discussion in this section .",
    "the use of dispersion relations in the investigation of scattering amplitudes may be traced back to the end of fifties , when they were introduced in the form of _ integral _ dispersion relations ( idr ) . despite the important results that have been obtained since then",
    ", one limitation of the integral forms is their non - local character : in order to obtain the real part of the amplitude , the imaginary part must be known for all values of the energy .",
    "moreover , the class of functions that allows analytical integration is limited .    in the last years",
    ", we have investigated the applicability of _ derivative _ dispersion relations ( ddr ) in place of integral forms @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite we present a recent review on different results and statements related to this replacement , and a discussion connecting these different aspects with the corresponding assumptions and classes of functions considered in each case .    in particular , we have shown that for the class of functions which are entire in the logarithm of the energy ( as is the case of analytic models at high energies ) it is possible to expand the integrand in the above formulas and by considering a high - energy approximation , represented by @xmath74 , to integrate term by term . in that case , as demonstrated in detail in @xcite , the derivative dispersion relations with one subtraction reads    @xmath75\\frac{{\\mathop{\\mathrm{im}}}f_+(s)}{s},\\ ] ]    @xmath76 \\frac{{\\mathop{\\mathrm{im}}}f_-(s)}{s } , \\label{eq:11}\\ ] ]    where the series expansion is implicit in the tangent operator . from this deduction one",
    "arrives to three formal results : ( 1 ) the subtraction constant is preserved when the idr are replaced by ddr and , therefore , in principle , can not be disregarded in fit procedures ; ( 2 ) except for the subtraction constant , the ddr with entire functions in the logarithm of the energy do not depend on any additional free parameter ; ( 3 ) the only approximation involved in the replacement concerns the lower limit in the idr ( 13 - 14 ) , namely @xmath77 , which represents a high - energy approximation . in the next two subsections",
    "we discuss some uses of the ddr with analytical models , and in the third subsection we return to the replacement of idr by ddr , investigating the important role of the subtraction constant from a practical point of view .      in this subsection",
    "we make use of two basic and well known parametrizations for the total cross sections and investigate the effects of the discrepancies in the experimental information from cosmic - ray experiments .      in the cosmic - ray region ,",
    "@xmath78 tev , the discrepancies on the total cross section information are due to both experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the determination of @xmath79 from p - air cross sections .",
    "the situation has been recently reviewed in detail in @xcite , where a complete list of references , numerical tables and discussions are presented .    from fig .",
    "1 we see that , despite the large error bars in the cosmic - ray region , we can identify two distinct sets of estimations : one corresponding to the results by the fly s eye collaboration ( fly s eye ) together with those by the akeno collaboration ( akeno ) ; the other set associated with the results by gaisser , sukhatme , and yodh ( gsy ) together with with those by nikolaev ( nikolaev ) . taken separately these two sets suggest different scenarios for the increase of the total cross section , as previously discussed in @xcite .    based on these considerations , it is important to investigate the behavior of the total cross section by taking into account the discrepancies that characterize the cosmic ray information . to this end , in @xcite we have considered _ two ensembles of data and experimental information _ , as follows :    @xmath80 ensemble i : @xmath4 and @xmath3 accelerator data + akeno + fly s eye ;    @xmath80 ensemble ii : @xmath4 and @xmath3 accelerator data + nikolaev + gsy .    to some extent , ensemble i represents a kind of high - energy standard picture and ensemble ii a nonstandard one .      with analytical parametrizations for @xmath3/@xmath4 total cross sections , the connections with the @xmath13 parameter , eq . ( 3 ) , are obtained by defining the associated crossing even and odd quantities ,    @xmath81    using the high - energy normalization for the optical theorem ,    @xmath82    and the ddr given by eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .    in @xcite",
    "we have considered two different parametrizations for the total cross sections , one introduced by donnachie and landshoff @xcite and other by kang and nicolescu @xcite .",
    "the main difference concerns the asymptotic limits , which allow the dominance of an even amplitude ( pomeron ) or the odd amplitude ( odderon ) , respectively . in this way , we may contrast these possibilities with the standard and non - standard pictures represented by ensembles i and ii .",
    "the _ donnachie - landshoff _ ( dl ) parametrization for the total cross sections is expressed by    @xmath83    where the first contribution is associated with a single pomeron exchange ( universal ) and the second one with reggeon exchange . with",
    "the procedure explained above , we obtain the analytical connections with the @xmath13 parameter for @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering :    @xmath84s^{\\epsilon }    \\nonumber \\\\ & + &    \\left[\\frac{(y - z)}{2}\\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2}\\right ) - \\frac{(y+z)}{2}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2}\\right)\\right]s^{- \\eta } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath85s^{\\epsilon }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{(z - y)}{2}\\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2}\\right ) - \\frac{(y+z)}{2}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2}\\right)\\right]s^{- \\eta}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above formulas , since @xmath86 , this model predicts that , asymptotically ( @xmath52 ) ,    @xmath87    the parametrization for the total cross sections introduced by _ kang and nicolescu _ ( kn ) , under the hypothesis of the odderon , is given by    @xmath88    @xmath89    and the connections with @xmath13 read    @xmath90    @xmath91    differently from the previous case , this model predicts that the difference between the two cross sections is given by    @xmath92    so that , if @xmath93 and/or @xmath94 , the total cross section difference may increase and @xmath79 may even become greater than @xmath95 , depending on the values and signs of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which is formally in agreement with the theorems of sec .",
    "moreover , if @xmath96 and @xmath97 are sufficiently small , so that we may replace @xmath98 , then , asymptotically ,    @xmath99    this means that , depending on the fit results , there may be a change of sign in @xmath100 , with @xmath101 becoming greater than @xmath102 at some finite energy .",
    "therefore , the case of a crossing either in @xmath103 or @xmath13 is a sign of the odderon contribution in the imaginary or real part of the amplitude , respectively .",
    "we have performed 16 different fits through the program cern - minuit . in these fits",
    "we have used both ensembles i and ii and both the dl and kn models . for each of these four possibilities",
    "we have performed global and individual fits to @xmath103 and @xmath13 and , in each case , we either considered the subtraction constant @xmath72 as a free fit parameter , or assumed @xmath104 .",
    "all the results are presented and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "our main conclusions are the following : ( 1 ) despite the small influence from different cosmic - ray estimations , the results allow to extract an upper bound for the soft pomeron intercept : @xmath105 ; ( 2 ) although global fits present good statistical results , in general , this procedure constraints the rise of @xmath103 ; ( 3 ) the subtraction constant as a free parameter affects the fit results at both low and high energies ; ( 4 ) independently of the cosmic - ray information used and the subtraction constant , global fits with the odderon parametrization predict that , above @xmath106 gev , @xmath107 becomes greater than @xmath108 , and this result is in complete agreement with all the data presently available .",
