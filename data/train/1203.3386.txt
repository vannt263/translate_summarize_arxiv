    "electron - electron interactions are a source of coupling between closely spaced nano - electronic circuits .",
    "this coupling has commanded a great deal of attention during the past thirty years or so , since it constitutes a potential alternative to the inductive and capacitive couplings of conventional electronics .",

    "if no current is allowed to flow in the other well ( the  passive \" layer ) , an electric field develops whose associated force cancels the frictional drag force exerted by the electrons in the active layer on the electrons in the passive one .",
    "the transresistance @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the induced voltage in the passive layer to the applied current in the drive layer , directly measures the rate at which momentum is transferred from the current - carrying 2d electron gas to its neighbor .",
    "coulomb drag is ultimately caused by _",
    "fluctuations _ in the density of electrons in each layer since two - dimensional layers with uniformly distributed charge will not exert any frictional forces upon each other  @xcite .",
    "the study of coulomb - coupled 2d systems has now been revitalized by advances which have made it possible to prepare robust and ambipolar 2d electron systems ( ess ) , based on graphene  @xcite layers or on the surface states of topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite , that are described by an ultrarelativistic wave equation instead of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",

    "the protected surface states of 3d tis are associated with spin - orbit interaction driven bulk band inversions .",
    "3d tis in a slab geometry offer two surface states that can be far enough apart to make single - electron tunneling negligible , but close enough for coulomb interactions between surfaces to be important .",
    "unhybridized md2des pairs can be realized in graphene by separating two layers by a dielectric  @xcite ( such as @xmath2 ) or by a few layers of a one - atom - thick insulator such as bn  @xcite . in both cases",

    ". we will be only concerned with the so - called  fermi - liquid regime \" in which both layers are away from the charge neutrality point .",
    "our theory relies on second - order perturbation theory in the screened interlayer interaction and on boltzmann transport theory . in this theoretical framework and in the low - temperature limit , we demonstrate that , to leading ( _ i.e. _ quadratic ) order in temperature , the drag transresistivity is completely insensitive to the precise intralayer momentum - relaxation mechanism ( _ i.e. _ to the functional dependence of the scattering time on energy ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the findings reported in refs .   and  .",
    "we also provide new analytical results for the low - temperature drag transresistivity in both cases of  thick \" and  thin \" spacers , correcting in the latter case a mistake contained in ref .  .",

    "<S> coulomb drag between two unhybridized graphene sheets separated by a dielectric spacer has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest . </S>",
    "<S> we first review , for the sake of completeness , the main analytical results which have been obtained by other authors . </S>",
    "<S> we then illustrate pedagogically the minimal theory of coulomb drag between two spatially - separated two - dimensional systems of massless dirac fermions which are both away from the charge - neutrality point . </S>",
    "<S> this relies on second - order perturbation theory in the screened interlayer interaction and on boltzmann transport theory . in this theoretical framework and in the low - temperature limit , we demonstrate that , to leading ( _ i.e. _ quadratic ) order in temperature , the drag transresistivity is completely insensitive to the precise intralayer momentum - relaxation mechanism ( _ i.e. _ to the functional dependence of the scattering time on energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide analytical results for the low - temperature drag transresistivity for both cases of  thick \" and  thin \" spacers and for arbitrary values of the dielectric constants of the media surrounding the two dirac - fermion layers . finally , we present numerical results for the low - temperature drag transresistivity in the case </S>",
    "<S> in which one of the media surrounding the dirac - fermion layers has a frequency - dependent dielectric constant . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by suggesting an experiment that can potentially allow for the observation of departures from the canonical fermi - liquid quadratic - in - temperature behavior of the transresistivity . </S>"
