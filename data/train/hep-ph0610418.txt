    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) has a great potential to discover both direct and indirect signals with muon pairs for neutral higgs bosons in supersymmetry models  @xcite .",

    ", we adopt a common mass scale : @xmath28    = 3.6 in    in figure 1 , we present contours for the branching fraction @xmath29 ( current experimental limit  @xcite ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 as well as the discovery contours of @xmath14 at the lhc . for @xmath33 gev , lhc will be able to discover @xmath14 with an integrated luminosity ( @xmath5 ) of 30 fb@xmath6 in a significantly large region of the parameter space beyond @xmath34 . furthermore , with a higher luminosity of 300 fb@xmath6 , the lhc discovery contour for direct higgs search with @xmath35 gev is very close to the contour for @xmath36 .",
    "in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken in a hidden sector and susy breaking is communicated to the observable sector through gravitational interactions .",
