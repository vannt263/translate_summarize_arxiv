    "the most well - known unsolved problem concerning this dynamical system is the collatz conjecture , which states that all trajectories eventually reach 1 .",

    "specifically , we define @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , this model predicts that almost every positive integer @xmath13 has finite stopping time .",

    "the statistical tendency of such a random walk to diverge is entirely determined by value of @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , the probability of divergence in the @xmath8 system quickly approaches 1 .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a class of similar @xmath8 dynamical systems in @xmath16 $ ] which can also be modeled by a random walk . like those who have previously studied these systems , we are motivated by the principle that problems concerning @xmath17 $ ] are often easier to solve than the corresponding problems in @xmath18 , since we can often exploit the rich algebraic structure of polynomial rings over a field to simplify both numerical computations and theoretical analysis .",
    "the random walk model for @xmath8 systems turns out to be even more accurate in @xmath16 $ ] than in the integer case , and the parameter @xmath10 is always an integer .",
    "we show that in a certain sense the random walks associated to these polynomial @xmath8 problems interpolate between those of the traditional @xmath8 problems in @xmath18 , providing examples of a more general class of pseudo - random dynamical systems .    from algebraic geometry we know that @xmath17 $ ] is the ring of regular functions of the affine line over @xmath19 . this connection and the rich geometric tools available are the reasons why many arithmetic problems over @xmath18 become more approachable when we work over @xmath17 $ ] .",

    "first , note that if @xmath147 , each time the game is played , the gambler either loses $ 1 or stays even .",
    "the only way for the gambler to never drop below his or her initial value is to never lose at all , so the probability of avoiding ruin through the first @xmath88 games is @xmath148 .",
