    "nanomechanical and optomechanical devices are a versatile technology  @xcite , with a range of applications in the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "examples include small mass or weak - force detection  @xcite , quantum measurements  @xcite , and quantum - information processing . the first success in putting a mechanical device in a quantum state was performed  @xcite by purely cryogenic means , due to the frequency of the mechanical phonons  @xcite being larger than the thermal energy .",
    "since then lower - frequency devices ( which thus have larger mass ) have been put in quantum states using side - band cooling via microwave and optical cavities  @xcite .",
    "these breakthroughs have been followed by the observation of state transfer  @xcite between an electromagnetic cavity and the mechanical system , with the goal of developing hybrid mechanical circuit devices  @xcite for applications in quantum technologies  @xcite .",
    "moving into the nonlinear regime with such quantum nanomechanical devices is desirable for several reasons : it will allow us to observe highly nonclassical effects , as well as allowing to individually address different transitions within the mechanical system , so that it behaves as a mechanical artificial atom . in the realm of quantum optics  @xcite and circuit quantum electrodynamics  @xcite ,",
    "nonlinearities are typically associated with `` photon blockade '' ( also referred to as the optical state truncation by quantum nonlinear scissors  @xcite ) . in this regime",
    "the nonlinear nature of the spectrum of an optical cavity  @xcite , induced via , e.g. , a kerr nonlinearity , means that the presence of a single photon within the cavity prevents the transmission of a second photon . in nonlinear mechanical systems",
    "one expects an analogous `` phonon blockade ''  @xcite to arise .",
    "this requires either strong intrinsic nonlinearities  @xcite , or induced nonlinearity via ancillary nonlinear systems ( like qubits or artificial two - level systems  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , while coupling between mechanical phonons and electromagnetic photons has been achieved in the quantum regime  @xcite , the controlled coupling between multiple mechanical modes has so far been restricted to classical devices  @xcite .",
    "such controllable coupling would enable the observation of entangled states  @xcite , and the bell inequality violation with massive objects  @xcite , as well as the realization of coupled mechanical qubits  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this work is to study the combination of nonlinearity - induced phonon blockade effects via the coupling between the mechanical modes of namrs .",
    "we will show that the infinite - dimensional mechanical states of the namrs , under proper resonance conditions , can effectively be truncated to the states of finite - dimensional systems of either two coupled qubits , a three - level system ( called a qutrit ) coupled to a four - level system ( referred to as quartit or ququart ) , or , in general , two coupled @xmath3-level systems ( qudits ) .    while our model can be considered as a quantum limit of the classical systems studied in  ref .",
    "@xcite , we discuss explicitly how the nonlinearities can be tuned using an ancilla two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "we will show how this combination of phonon - blockade and two - namr ( or two - mode ) coupling leads to multiphonon blockade ( or phonon tunneling ) , in analogy to the predictions of multiphoton blockade  @xcite and closely related photon tunneling  @xcite .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite provides a pedagogical explanation of how photon blockade can lead to the observation of a single - photon tunneling effect in an analogous way to how coulomb blockade can lead to the observation of single - electron tunneling .",
    "we discuss here how the form of the multiphonon blockade can be tuned via driving , and verify the resultant highly nonclassical states with a variety of measures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe a model for a hybrid system of coupled linear namrs and tlss . in this section and in appendix",
    "a , we also show how a kerr - type nonlinearity can be induced via namr - tls interactions , and derive an effective hamiltonian for the coupled nonlinear namrs .",
    "the possibility of observing multiphonon blockades in this system is described in sec .",
    "we summarize several methods to assess nonclassicality , which we then apply in our analysis of phonon blockade in secs .",
