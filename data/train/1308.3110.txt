    "optical nanomaterials are artificial substances with subwavelength - sized unit cells that contain specially designed nanoparticles ( artificial atoms ) .",
    "light propagation in such a material is fully determined by the way electromagnetic waves are scattered and absorbed by the nanoparticles .",
    "the optical characteristics of the material can be described using effective material parameters , such as refractive index @xmath0 and wave impedance @xmath1 when the nanomaterial can be treated as homogeneous . for a given nanomaterial design ,",
    "these parameters are commonly retrieved by calculating the light transmission and reflection by a slab of such nanomaterial.@xcite using these retrieval procedures , certain nanomaterials have been designed to exhibit extreme values for the material parameters , which can not be found in nature.@xcite the commonly used retrieval procedures rely upon the assumption that the nanomaterial is free of spatial dispersion and , thus , treatable in terms of standard fresnel transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "these assumptions , however , may not hold for materials composed of asymmetric nanoscatterers , such as typical split - ring - resonators used to obtain artificial magnetism.@xcite    nanomaterials in which two counter - propagating optical waves see the medium differently belong to a specific class of optically bifacial nanomaterials .",
    "the nanoscatterers in these materials are not centrosymmetric . in this work ,",
    "we consider uniaxial noncentrosymmetric nanomaterials . more complicated nanomaterials , such as those composed of chiral nanoparticles , are left out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "although asymmetric scatterers have been widely studied in terms of their scattering properties@xcite , magnetic near - field enhancement@xcite , localized absorption@xcite , color switching@xcite and mimicking electromagnetically induced transparency@xcite , no adequate theory currently exists for the description of nanomaterials constructed of such scatterers .",
    "for example , for a bifacial nanomaterial , the standard fresnel coefficients can not be applied . in this paper , we develop the necessary formalism - that allows calculation of the material parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 - and use it to investigate the key properties of such artificial bifacial media .",
    "in particular , we find that two counter - propagating waves in the material must experience the same refractive index , but they can have dramatically different wave impedances .",
    "we apply our model to a particular example of optical nanomaterials consisting of metal nanodimers and verify the correctness of our model by rigorous numerical calculations .",
    "we also verify that in the limiting case of symmetric nanoscatterers , our model is in agreement with the results of the existing retrieval procedures .",
    "we start by considering a three - dimensional nanomaterial that consists of periodically arranged nanoscatterers in a transparent dielectric host medium of refractive index @xmath2 .",
    "this three - dimensional array can be thought as a set of two - dimensional nanoscatterer arrays , which are stacked in a certain common direction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we choose the @xmath3 axis to point in this direction and the length of the unit cell along @xmath3 to be @xmath4 . for an optical plane wave propagating in the material , each two - dimensional nanoscatterer array",
    "can be treated as an infinitesimally thin sheet with a plane - wave transmission coefficient @xmath5 and reflection coefficient @xmath6 , which in general both depend on the wave propagation direction and polarization . as has been shown in ref .",
    ", these coefficients can be obtained by calculating the plane - wave transmission and reflection by an isolated two - dimensional nanoscatterer array in the host medium .",
    "as long as the periodicities within the array are sufficiently small compared to the local wavelength @xmath7 , there will be no coupling of diffraction orders between successive ",
    "crystal \" planes in the material .",
    "moreover , in the presence of sufficiently large spacing between neighboring nanoscatterers , the evanescent - wave coupling between the crystal planes can be safely neglected.@xcite thus , in the analysis , there will locally be only two counter - propagating plane waves in the crystal , due to the finite reflection provided by each crystal plane .",
    "the optical response of the nanomaterial to a plane wave propagating _ in the host medium _ at an angle @xmath8 with respect to the @xmath3 axis is then fully determined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "the results of these calculations are presented in fig .",
    "[ figa5 ] by stars .",
    "these results are seen to be in perfect agreement with the results obtained using our effective material parameters .",
    "the suppressed reflection at @xmath147  nm originates from the fact that at this wavelength the nanomaterial is approximately impedance - matched to vacuum ( see figs .",
    "[ figte ] and [ figtm ] ) .",
    "we have introduced a theoretical model for calculating the electromagnetic characteristics of designed bifacial optical nanomaterials that are composed of noncentrosymmetric nanoparticles with a single symmetry axis . in general , these characteristics depend on the propagation direction of light , and for bifacial nanomaterials they are different for two counter - propagating waves .",
    "our approach enables direct evaluation of the material s refractive index and wave impedance from the transmission and reflection coefficients of a single crystal plane of the constituent nanoscatterers .",
    "this makes the required numerical calculations fast .",
    "taking into account the dependence of the material parameters on the light propagation direction , we have derived generalized fresnel coefficients that describe the light transmission and reflection at the surface of a bifacial nanomaterial .",
    "we have found that in order to create an optically bifacial nanomaterial , it is necessary to use nanoscatterers in which light can efficiently excite higher - order electromagnetic multipoles .",
    "one remarkable finding is that inside such a nanomaterial , two counter - propagating waves necessarily see equal refractive indices , while they can experience quite different wave impedances .",
    "the practical application of the theory was demonstrated with a particular example of a bifacial nanomaterial composed of metal - disc nanodimers . using the model ,",
    "we have designed and characterized a material that is impedance - matched to the surrounding medium ( glass and vacuum ) for a wave propagating in a certain direction , but not for a counter - propagating wave .",
    "this work opens up the possibility to comprehensively describe and design uniaxial bifacial optical nanomaterials .",
    "the asymmetry of the unit cells in such materials can provide the substance with an extraordinary electromagnetic response that is not possible to find in natural materials .",
    "for example , a nanomaterial slab can be designed to have a desired spectrum of the refractive index and/or to reflect light only by one of its surfaces .",
    "the latter feature can be of interest for imaging and energy - harvesting applications , including ultrathin wide - angle bifacial antireflection coatings and high - efficiency solar cells .",
