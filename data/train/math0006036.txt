    "lovsz and schrijver ( 1991 ) have proposed a very intriguing successive convex relaxation procedure for 0 - 1 integer programming problems .",
    "the procedure called @xmath0 , to be defined shortly , when applied to a classical linear programming ( lp ) relaxation of the stable set problem ( with only the edge and nonnegativity constraints ) produces a relaxation for which many well - known inequalities are valid , including the odd hole , odd antihole , odd wheel , clique , and even the orthonormal representation inequalities of grtschel , lovsz and schrijver ( 1981 ) .",
    "this implies that for many classes of graphs , including perfect ( for which clique inequalities are sufficient ) or t - perfect graphs ( for which odd hole inequalities are sufficient ) , one can find the maximum stable set by using the @xmath0 procedure .",
    "the @xmath0 procedure is a strengthening of another procedure , called @xmath1 , also introduced by lovsz and schrijver .",
    "the main difference between the two procedures is that @xmath0 involves a positive semidefinite constraint .",
    "when applied to a linear programming relaxation , @xmath1 will produce another ( stronger ) lp relaxation while @xmath0 will produce a semidefinite relaxation .",
    "for the stable set problem , lovsz and schrijver have shown that the relaxation produced by @xmath1 is much weaker than the one derived from @xmath0 .    in general",
    ", it is however not clear in which situations the procedure @xmath0 is better or significantly better than @xmath1 ; especially , when @xmath1 and @xmath0 are applied iteratively . in this paper",
    ", we try to shed some light on this question .",
    "we generalize certain properties derived by lovsz and schrijver .",
    "we also identify certain situations in which @xmath1 produces the same relaxation as @xmath0 .",
    "several examples are discussed throughout the paper , including one in which the number of iterations of the @xmath0 procedure needed to derive the convex hull of 0 - 1 points is equal to the dimension of the space , hence resolving a question left open by lovsz and schrijver .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the lift - and - project procedures and their basic properties .",
    "section [ sec : up ] includes upper bounds on the number of major iterations required by such procedures .",
    "section [ sec : low ] discusses techniques to prove lower bounds on the number of major iterations required .",
    "sections [ sec : lowercomp ] and [ sec : gen ] include geometric properties and characterizations of the convex relaxations produced by the procedures .",
    "first , we describe two lift - and - project procedures proposed by lov ' asz and schrijver ( 1991 ) which produce tighter and tighter relaxations of the convex hull of @xmath2-@xmath3 points in a convex set . in what follows , @xmath4 is the @xmath5th unit vector and @xmath6 is the vector of all ones .",
    "the sizes of @xmath6 and @xmath4 will be clear from the context .",
    "the cone generated by all 0 - 1 vectors @xmath7 with @xmath8 is called @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote a convex cone ; for example , @xmath11 could be a polyhedral cone obtained from a polytope @xmath12 in @xmath13^d$ ] via homogenization using a new variable @xmath14 . that is , if @xmath15 then @xmath16 we are interested in determining ( or approximating ) @xmath17 , the cone generated by all 0 - 1 vectors of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote the dual cones of @xmath11 and @xmath9 under the standard euclidean inner - product , e.g. , @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the space of @xmath22 symmetric matrices and @xmath23 denotes the cone of @xmath24 symmetric , positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "for a matrix @xmath25 , we denote its positive semidefiniteness by @xmath26 .",
    "when we deal with the duals of convex cones in the space of @xmath27 matrices ( or in the subspace of the symmetric matrices ) , we always take the underlying inner - product to be the trace inner - product ( or frobenius inner - product ) : @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the linear operator which maps a symmetric matrix to its diagonal .",
    "then its adjoint @xmath30 is the linear operator @xmath31 which maps a vector from @xmath32 to the diagonal    atrix in @xmath21 whose @xmath33th component is the @xmath34th component of the original vector .",
    "[ defi : m ] a @xmath27 symmetric matrix , @xmath35 , with real entries is in @xmath36 if    * @xmath37 , and * @xmath38    lov ' asz and schrijver note that condition ( ii ) of the above definition is equivalent to @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) , or : @xmath41 @xmath42 for all @xmath43 and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 since the extreme rays ( after normalization ) of the cone @xmath19 are given by @xmath46    [ defi : mplus ] @xmath47 if @xmath48 and @xmath35 is positive semidefinite .    observe that if we take any @xmath49 ( not necessarily integral ) and consider @xmath50 , @xmath35 satisfies @xmath51 and also ( ii) , but this specific @xmath35 satisfies ( i ) if and only if @xmath52 is such that @xmath53 for all @xmath34 , i.e.  @xmath52 corresponds to a @xmath2-@xmath3 vector .",
    "now , we define the projections of these liftings @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 @xmath57 the above argument regarding @xmath58 shows that @xmath59 , the last inclusion following from the fact that @xmath60 and @xmath42 imply that @xmath61 .    if @xmath12 is a polytope ( or any convex set ) in @xmath13^d$ ] then we simply write @xmath62 to represent @xmath63 where @xmath11 is the cone obtained via homogenization using the variable @xmath14 , and similarly for @xmath64 .",
    "we also let @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    we should point out that the definition of @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) is such that @xmath36 depends only on the sets @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , we have :    let @xmath11 and @xmath69 be such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 for all @xmath72",
    ". then @xmath73 ( and @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( and @xmath76 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) have the same @xmath79 .",
    "the definitions of @xmath54 , @xmath1 , @xmath55 and @xmath0 are invariant under various operations including flipping coordinates @xmath80 for any subset of the indices @xmath81 .",
    "more formally ,    [ prop:2.1 ] let @xmath82 be a linear transformation mapping @xmath9 onto itself .",
    "then @xmath83    one crucial feature of the operators @xmath1 and @xmath0 is that they can be iterated .",
    "the iterated operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all integers @xmath90 .",
    "lovsz and schrijver ( 1991 ) show that , even without the positive semidefiniteness constraints , @xmath91 iterations are sufficient to get @xmath17 :    [ thm : ls ] @xmath92 and @xmath93    let @xmath94 be a valid inequality for @xmath17 .",
    "then the smallest nonnegative integer @xmath95 such that @xmath94 is valid for @xmath84 is called _ the @xmath1-rank of @xmath96",
    "relative to @xmath11 . _",
    "the @xmath0-rank of @xmath94 relative to @xmath11 is defined similarly . the above theorem states that these ranks are at most @xmath91 for any valid inequality .",
    "the @xmath1-rank ( resp.@xmath0-rank ) of a cone @xmath11 is the smallest nonnegative integer @xmath95 such that @xmath97 ( resp.@xmath98 ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : ls ] can also be proved using the results of balas ( 1974 ) , see balas , ceria and cornujols ( 1993 ) .",
    "our interest , in this paper , mostly lies in understanding the strength of @xmath0 in comparison to @xmath1 .",
    "consider the stable set polytope on a graph @xmath99 defined as the convex hull of incidence vectors of sets of non - adjacent vertices ( known as stable sets ) .",
    "let @xmath100 be the relaxation defined by the edge constraints ( @xmath101 for all edges @xmath102 ) and the nonnegativity constraints ( @xmath103 for all @xmath104 ) .",
    "then @xmath105 is exactly equal to the relaxation obtained by adding all odd hole inequalities , saying that @xmath106 for any odd cycle @xmath107 with no chords .",
    "however , many more complicated inequalities have small @xmath0-rank .",
    "lovsz and schrijver ( 1991 ) prove that odd hole , odd antihole , odd wheel , clique and orthogonal inequalities all have @xmath0-rank at most 1 , relative to @xmath100 .",
    "these results are proved using lemma [ lem:2.2 ] of next section , except for the orthogonality constraints .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-rank of a clique inequality for example is equal to @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the size of the clique .",
    "note that the separation problem for the class of clique inequalities is np - hard ( and so is the problem of optimizing over the clique inequalities , see grtschel , lovsz and schrijver ( 1981 ) ) .",
    "@xmath0 , however , leads to a polynomial - time separation algorithm for a broader class of inequalities .",
    "this , and more generally the importance of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , stems from the following result .",
    "[ thm : complexity ] if we have a weak separation oracle for @xmath11 then we have a weak separation oracle for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for any fixed constant @xmath95 .    together with the equivalence between ( weak ) optimization and ( weak ) separation ( grtschel et al .",
    "( 1981 ) ) , this implies for example that the stable set problem can be solved in polynomial time for any graph with bounded @xmath0-rank ( lovsz and schrijver  ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "next we study the upper bounds on @xmath1- and @xmath0-ranks of inequalities and convex sets .",
    "lovsz and schrijver give some ways to upper bound the @xmath1-rank of an inequality .",
    "they show the following .",

    "lemma [ lem:2.1 ] shows that an inequality will be valid for @xmath115 if it is valid for @xmath116 and @xmath117 for some @xmath34 . in order to iterate lemma [ lem:2.1 ]",
    ", we first need the following lemma .",
    "it is stated in terms of the faces of @xmath9 , which can be obtained by intersecting @xmath9 with hyperplanes of the form @xmath118 or @xmath119 .",
    "similar insights for a procedure related to the @xmath1- procedure were discussed by balas ( 1974 ) .",
    "[ lem : face ] let @xmath120 be any face of @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath121 similarly for @xmath0 and @xmath111 .    *",
    "* `` @xmath122 '' is clear from the definitions . for the converse , let @xmath123",
    "this means that there exists a matrix @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath126 and @xmath127 and their sum @xmath128 belongs to the face @xmath120 of @xmath9 , we have that @xmath129 and @xmath130 must belong to @xmath120 , by definition of a face .",

    "repeatedly using lemma [ lem:2.1 ] and lemma [ lem : face ] ( or corollary [ cor : face ] ) , we can derive a condition that an inequality be valid for @xmath84 .",

    "for example , for @xmath143 , one can show that @xmath144 .    for @xmath145 , lovsz and schrijver ( 1991 ) give a different condition for the validity of an inequality . in the statement of the next lemma , the assumption that @xmath146 is without loss of generality ( by flipping coordinates if necessary , as shown in proposition [ prop:2.1 ] ) .",

    ", there exists several important constructions to derive facet - defining valid inequalities from other facet - defining inequalities .",
    "the simplest is _ cloning _ a clique at a vertex @xmath150 , which consists of replacing the vertex by a clique , replacing all the edges incident to @xmath150 by corresponding edges incident to all clique vertices and substituting in the inequality the variable for @xmath150 by the sum of the variables of the clique vertices .",
    "it can easily be shown that the resulting inequality is valid and facet - defining if the original inequality was a non - trivial ( i.e.  different from the nonnegativity constraints ) facet - defining inequality .",
    "in general , it is not clear how cloning influences the @xmath0-rank of an inequality .",
    "however , if we perform cloning at the center vertex of an odd wheel inequality , lemma [ lem:2.2 ] implies that the @xmath0-rank still remains equal to 1 .",
    "if we perform cloning at one or several vertices of an odd wheel , odd hole or odd antihole inequality , lemma [ lem:2.2 ] implies that the @xmath0-rank is at most 2 .",
    "indeed , if we fix any variable ( of the corresponding subgraph ) to 1 , the resulting inequality can be seen to be a linear combination of clique inequalities and hence valid for @xmath151 .",
