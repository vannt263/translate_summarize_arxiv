    "the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , presented by wigner in 1932 @xcite , offers a classical like formulation .",

    "the hdf is positive definite and has no negativity at all @xcite .",
    "the expectation values of physical quantities are assumed to be independent of different phase space representations , therefore all distribution functions should be , in general , equivalent @xcite .",

    "it specially vanishes for the positive definite distribution functions like hdfs .",
    "the equivalence of distribution functions lead authors to ask , `` if the negativity of wdfs indicate to the physical quantum effects , what about them in other distribution functions ? '' .",
    "clearly the kenfack and yczkowski s nonclassicality indicator ( which does nt vanish for wdfs ) vanishes for hdf . to remove this inconsistency another nonclassicality indicator is introduced by sadeghi _",
