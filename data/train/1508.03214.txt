    "* * devices design and fabrication**. the devices were fabricated on the standard silicon - on - insulator wafer with a 220 nm silicon layer and a 2 mm buried silica oxide layer .",
    "mmi couplers were designed as 2.8 m27 m to get a balanced splitting ratio ( fig.1d ) .",
    "mmis offer a large bandwidth and a large fabrication tolerance .",
    "spiralled waveguide sources with a 2-cm length were used to create photon - pairs .",
    "the 1d grating couplers consist of a periodic 315 nm silicon layer with a 630 nm pitch .",
    "the 2d grating couplers include 10 m10 m hole arrays with a 390 nm diameter and a 605 nm pitch .",
    "resistive heaters with a 50 m - length were designed and formed by a ti / tin metal layer .",
    "the devices were fabricated using the deep - uv ( 193 nm ) lithography at leti - epixfab .",
    "silicon waveguides were 220 nm fully etched , while 1d and 2d grating couplers were 70 nm shallow etched .",

    "* optical accesses and electric accesses were independently controlled on two chips ( fig.s1 ) .",
    "optical accesses were achieved using v - groove single modes fibre arrays with a 127 m pitch .",
    "fibres were titled with an angle of 10@xmath6612 degrees to guarantee both grating couplers work at the required wavelengths .",
    "excess loss of 1d and 2d grating couplers were about -4.8 db and -7.6 db at peak wavelengths , respectively ( fig.s2 ) .",
    "extinction ratio of 1d and 2d grating couplers were measured to be larger than 20 db and 18 db , respectively .",
    "we estimated losses from different contributors in the system : -6 db from off - chip filters , -6 db from ssnpds , -9@xmath669.5 db from 1d grating couplers , -15@xmath6615.5 db from 2d grating couplers , -6 db from demultiplexing mmis , and -8@xmath669 db from mmis excess loss and propagation loss in waveguides .",

    "fibre alignment was automatically recoupled using piezo - electronic stacks .",
    "fig.s4 shows the stability of the chip - to - chip system , which were maintained constant more than 30 mins .",
