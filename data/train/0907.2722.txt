    "almost any topic of the physics of heavy ion collisions can be explored using photons .",
    "decay photons can be used to measure spectra , flow , nuclear modification factors and more complicated observables of neutral mesons : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "direct photons provide possibility to explore the initial state of a collision and evolution of the fireball through the thermal emission .",
    "separation of isolated and inclusive direct photons provides the possibility to evaluate contributions of different processes of direct photon emission and to look at modification of jets in the medium . finally constructing the photon - hadron and photon - jet correlations one can produce parton fragmentation functions and study their modifications in medium .",
    "all these topics are well developed now and widely presented in this conference , see e.g reviews of phenix and star results @xcite .",
    "alice has an excellent possibility to explore all variety of signals in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition to an advanced tracking system , alice includes 2 electromagnetic calorimeters : photon spectrometer ( phos ) and emcal .",
    "the phos is a calorimeter with very fine granularity and high energy and position resolutions .",
    "its primary goal is a precise measurement of the low and medium energy @xmath0 and direct photons , however , it is able to measure photons with energies up to 100 gev .",
    "the second calorimeter , emcal , installed back - to - back to phos , is concentrated on the measurement of hard photons and jets .",
    "it has a larger acceptance but coarser granularity and a moderate energy resolution .",
    "in addition to these calorimeters , photons in alice can be measured via their conversion in the central tracking system .",
    "this method has a rather low efficiency , which is compensated to a large extend by a large acceptance of the alice tracking system , so that the product acceptance  @xmath3  efficiency for the @xmath0 detection is only 20 times smaller than that for the phos .",
    ".comparison of the properties of the alice photon detectors . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparison of the energy and position resolutions of alice photon detectors is presented in table  [ calo - comp ] .",
    "the phos and the central tracking system provide comparable energy and angular resolutions somewhat better than those of the emcal .",
    "the best way to compare resolutions of calorimeters is to look at the width of the @xmath0 peak .",
    "we present the widths we expect at @xmath4 gev / c in pp collisions in table  [ calo - comp ] . for the phos and the conversion method the widths are comparable , while for the emcal",
    "the width is @xmath5 times larger .",
    "so the alice incorporates 3 photon detectors providing comparable resolutions .",
    "all three use different experimental techniques which result in different systematic errors and insure a good cross - check of the results .",
    "there are 2 methods of detection of @xmath0 through its decay @xmath6 in a calorimeter : at low @xmath7 the decay photons are well separated and can be detected as two independent clusters so that invariant mass analysis can be applied .",
    "this method works for the emcal up to @xmath8 gev / c and for the phos up to @xmath9 gev / c . at higher",
    "momenta the photon clusters start to merge , and the invariant mass analysis can not be applied .",
    "however , high-@xmath7 @xmath0 s produce non - spherical clusters which allows to identify them via a shower shape analysis . with this method",
    "one can distinguish @xmath0 and @xmath10 in the emcal up to @xmath11 gev / c @xcite and in the phos up to @xmath12 gev / c @xcite .",
    "for the heavier mesons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the @xmath7 scales are moved accordingly to the increased masses .",
    "therefore the main concern in the measurement of the neutral meson spectrum in pp collisions is a limited statistics .",
    "( left ) and direct photons ( right ) registered in phos in pp collisions at @xmath13 tev for several values of the integrated luminosity corresponding to different scenarios of the first lhc run.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   ( left ) and direct photons ( right ) registered in phos in pp collisions at @xmath13 tev for several values of the integrated luminosity corresponding to different scenarios of the first lhc run.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to increase collected statistics at high @xmath7 , both the phos and the emcal define high @xmath7 triggers on energy deposited in @xmath14 or @xmath15 tiles .",
    "the transition radiation detector ( trd ) investigates the possibility to define a trigger on a hard converted photon using @xmath16 pair with high @xmath7 and small opening angle . applying these triggers",
    "we will increase the integrated luminosity , collected in the first alice pp run from @xmath17 @xmath18 ( alice min.bias ) to 100 @xmath18 , corresponding to the initial lhc luminosity and even 300 @xmath18 , corresponding to the optimal lhc luminosity . using the nlo pqcd predictions of direct photon and @xmath0 yields @xcite , and applying phos acceptance and efficiency @xcite , we calculated the number of @xmath0 and @xmath19 detected per 1 gev bin of @xmath7 for 3 values of integrated luminosity , see fig .",
    "[ pp - range ] .",
    "so , in the most probable scenario of lhc running we can measure the @xmath0 ( direct photon ) spectrum in phos up to @xmath11 ( 12 ) gev / c without the phos trigger and 40 - 50 ( 20 - 30 ) gev with the phos photon trigger .",

    "however , due to the good resolutions of the phos detector , the @xmath0 peak is clearly seen down to soft @xmath21 gev / c even in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "similar to the pp collisions we estimate the accessible range of @xmath0 and direct photon extraction in pb+pb collisions at 5.5 tev .",
    "we used binary scaled spectra @xcite in pp collisions multiplied by nuclear modification factors : unit for photons and 0.2 for @xmath0 , see fig.[pbpb - range ] . in this case",
    "we will be able to measure the @xmath0 spectrum up to @xmath22 gev / c and direct photons up to @xmath23 gev / c .",
    "hard direct photons can be emitted both in hard collisions of partons of colliding nucleons and in jet fragmentation .",
    "direct photons of the first type are not accompanied by hadrons and thus can be identified in event - by - event basis using isolation technique .",
    "isolation is effective down to @xmath24 gev / c , in pp collisions and @xmath25 gev / c in pb+pb collisions @xcite . to illustrate this we present simulations of the emcal response to @xmath10-jet event in pb+pb collision .",
    "the signal ( @xmath10+jet ) is generated using pythia and the underlying event with hijing ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) .",
    "spectra of all and isolated hard direct photons as well as jet remnants which passed the isolation cut are shown in fig .",
    "[ daa ] , left plot . contamination becomes comparable with the signal at @xmath25 gev / c .",
    "using the isolated photons one can construct the best possible approximation of the parton fragmentation function  hadron conditional yield or imbalance function .",
    "the only difference between the true fragmentation function and the imbalance function is the initial state radiation ( @xmath28 smearing ) .",
    "having constructed the imbalance functions both in pp and aa collisions one can study the modification of the imbalance function in aa collisions as a deviation of the ratio @xmath29 from the unit , see fig .",
    "[ daa ] , right plot .",
    "photons in alice can be measured in two dedicated electromagnetic calorimeters and in addition using photon conversion in the central tracking system .",
    "all methods provide comparable resolutions but different systematic errors .",
    "we provided an estimate of the accessible range in measurement of @xmath0 and direct photon spectra in upcoming pp and pb+pb lhc runs .",
    "in addition , the feasibility of measuring isolated photon spectra , to construct the @xmath10-jet and @xmath10-hadron correlations in pp and pb+pb collisions and studying modification of fragmentation functions in medium , were estimated .",
