    "when the magnetic field is low , there is a class of states which peak in the quantum well region but have also a large oscillatory amplitude in the electrostatic barrier region due to klein tunneling . as the field increases , the amplitude in the barrier decreases exponentially and the states become confined very close to the centre of the dot .",
    "the suppression of the klein tunneling with the magnetic field may be employed in coupled dots .",
    "the interdot coupling is expected to be strong ( weak ) in the low ( high ) magnetic field regime .",

    "then as @xmath25 increases the amplitude of the two components in the barrier is gradually suppressed and the state becomes confined near the centre of the well . for @xmath133 t",
    "the hybridised state has approximately the form of the state in the upper energy ladder and @xmath134 everywhere in the barrier .",
    "thus no klein tunneling occurs at high @xmath25 .",

    "to demonstrate the formation of confined states in a graphene quantum dot the main focus of the experiment should be on the state with energy level @xmath125 and in the field range @xmath139 t. the reason for this choice is twofold .",
    "first , this state lies in a very low dos region and thus it could be resolved using standard charge sensing measurements .",
    "second , the energy of this state is away from the lls and its detection should be possible when the ll broadening is @xmath140 10 mev .",
    "this value has to be smaller when the magnetic field is not in the above range or when the experiment probes the energy level @xmath126 .",
    "this work investigated the properties of a graphene quantum dot formed by the combination of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the electric field creates a smooth quantum well potential which could be generated using gate electrodes . because of the klein tunneling effect in graphene the well can not confine electrons .",
    "however , when a uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet the states decay asymptotically as needed for confinement .",
    "the electric field modifies the landau level spectrum by inducing levels within the landau gaps .",
    "it was demonstrated that the states which correspond to these levels are tunable with the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this property has also been considered in one - dimensional systems of graphene such as wave - guides and wires .",
    "@xcite    some of the basic properties of the dot system were qualitatively extracted from the classical energy - momentum relation of massless particles .",
    "these properties were then confirmed and quantified with exact numerical calculations . it was found that some states can peak both in the potential well and within the barrier because of the klein tunneling effect in graphene .",
    "this behaviour can not be observed in a non - relativistic dot described by a schrdinger equation .",
    "states which peak in the barrier region occur also in one - dimensional systems of graphene and have been examined in refs .   and  .",
    "the relative amplitude of the states in each region depends on the values of the electric and magnetic fields and thus it can be tuned at will .",
    "for example , at a high magnetic field there are states which peak very close to the centre of the well and decay exponentially in the barrier . for low enough fields ,",
    "klein tunneling is involved and the amplitude of the states in the barrier increases drastically .",
    "coupling between states which peak in different regions results in the formation of anticrossing points in the energy spectrum of the dot , provided the well is deep .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that the density of states is relatively low between the few lowest landau levels .",
