    "the scenario of formation of low mass stars ( m @xmath3 8 m@xmath4 ) , through disk accretion controlled by magnetic field is already well understood @xcite . for high masses ( m @xmath5 8 m@xmath4 ) , however , there are theoretical problems for applying the same scenario . from the observational point of view , there are too few bona fide candidates to test the models .",
    "this is due to the fact that massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) are short lived and occur inside large molecular clouds , subject to huge reddening .",
    "the relevant phases of massive stars formation are not seen directly at wavelengths shorter than the mid - infrared ( mir ) and also to wavelengths longer than radio - mm .",
    "shocked molecular outflows are `` smoking guns '' of the accretion process and can be traced outside the central heavily obscured zone .",
    "the aim of this work is to use the h@xmath0 @xmath1=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission to constrain the possible models .    even after decades of progress both theoretical and observational fronts ,",
    "formation of massive stars remains an open question .",
    "the short timescale for myso formation indicates that high rates of mass accretion are required .",
    "two scenarios currently dominate the discussions , @xmath6 in the first , high mass stars are formed by accretion through a disk @xcite ; @xmath7 in the second , high mass stars are formed via coalescence of low mass stars @xcite . in the last decade , a number of observations have been presented favoring the first scenario , among them @xcite and @xcite .",
    "low and intermediate mass stars are formed by the gravitational collapse of the parental giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , followed by the accretion process @xcite . during the accretion phase",
    ", material is ejected as well via collimated bipolar jets . however ,",
    "when a yso reaches 8 m@xmath4 , the radiative flux becomes so intense ( using @xmath8 , the ratio between the radiative fluxes of an o5 and a b3 star  masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 m@xmath4 , respectively  is @xmath11 ) that it may interrupt the accretion flow .",
    "a process that constrains the outcoming radiation field to narrower angles may leave some room for the accretion process to continues in some directions .",
    "this seems to be the case for the outflows driven by young stars from a very broad mass range , as previous reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "outflows associated with high - mass objects are expected to be more energetic than the outflows observed in lower mass ysos @xcite , with velocities greater than @xmath12 km s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "some authors have found evidences that outflows associated with massive stars are scaled up versions of their low mass counterparts @xcite while other works have reported that no well - collimated outflows have been found toward mysos @xcite .",
    "massive yso outflows mapped in high - velocity co lines have collimation factors r = length / width @xmath2 2.05@xmath140.96 as compared to r @xmath2 2.81@xmath142.16 for low mass stars @xcite , indicating a weak tendency that outflows associated with massive stars are less collimated than those from low mass stars as previously thought @xcite . besides the degree of collimation",
    ", these massive outflows would work removing mass from the plane of the accretion disk , lowering the density on the plane and , therefore , facilitating the accretion flow to reach the stellar core as shown in the recent 3-d simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "although these authors have not included the outflow activity on their simulations , they argue that the presence of outflows would decrease the star formation efficiency from 70% ( considering purely radiation effects ) to 50% .    in the second scenario ,",
    "massive stars are formed by collision and coalescence of low mass stars in dense clusters @xcite .",
    "the low mass stars are formed after the gravitational collapse of the gmc and through an accretion disk , interact with each other , colliding to form stars with greater masses . in this case",
    ", the massive stars would be formed in the highest density parts of clusters , and the low mass stars would be the dominant fraction of the entire cluster mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , no massive stars would be expected in small stellar clusters .",
    "while there is no observational evidence for stellar merges in clusters , a growing number of observations supports the accretion disk scenario by answering questions such as the duration of accretion period @xcite , the required accretion rates to overcome the radiation pressure @xcite and the confirmation of molecular jets ejected from these massive objects @xcite .",
    "the existence of outflows driven by stars from a large mass range is a potentially interesting aspect , since stellar mergers can not produce stable outflows ; therefore , the observation of such flows can be used to discern between the two scenarios of massive star formation .",
    "bipolar molecular jets associated with myso candidates indicate that massive stars are formed by accretion .",
    "however , previous samples were contaminated by low mass objects , mostly due to inaccurate photometry . recently , myso candidates were observed in the h@xmath0 @xmath1=1 - 0 s(1 ) transition and collimated jets were identified , suggesting accreting discs around these objects @xcite .",
    "although this work presents observational evidence for the accretion scenario , few mysos were confirmed in that sample .    to identify bonafide myso candidates , accurate",
    "photometry and well developed selection criteria are necessary to avoid contamination by normal h regions , proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) and cool stars .",
    "the red msx source ( rms ) survey @xcite contains a large list of objects measured in 2mass , msx , spitzer , and reprocessed iras / igal images for objects along the galactic plane , including ultra - compact ( uc ) h regions and a large sample of mysos .",
    "additional observations were used to separate the mysos from uchs , such as water masers @xcite and centimetric emission @xcite .",
    "recently , the bolometric fluxes of those sources were derived by @xcite using ir and submillimetric data and adopting the kinematic distances derived by co observations from @xcite and a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model .",
    "they found there are few mysos ( @xmath15 ) with l @xmath16 10@xmath17 l@xmath4 , and many mysos ( @xmath18 ) with 10@xmath19 l@xmath4 @xmath20 l @xmath20 10@xmath17 l@xmath4 .",
    "there are a few examples of well documented accretion disks around massive ( 10 - 30 m@xmath4 ) forming stars @xcite using keplerian motion in the co lines .",
    "disks have been identified in a few cases @xcite through profile fitting of emission features seen in high spectral resolution data , however , the accretion process might have already ceased and the disks are now passively evolving .",
    "although the scenario of an accretion disk may apply for all massive stars , the details are lacking .",
    "instead of doing a detailed study of a small number of potential candidates that might harbor a disk , we are moving toward a large statistical study which will point to accretion signatures ( or not ) of a well selected sample of mysos , selected by the rms survey .",
    "a smaller survey based on the present motivation was conducted by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that @xmath21 of the targets display h@xmath0 emission , which is indicative of shocks , and in @xmath22 of the sample the h@xmath0 features have some symmetry , suggesting collimated outflows and so accretion disks . such signatures are more frequent in pre - uch than in uch phase .",
    "the most luminous ysos in that sample correspond to early b or late o star progenitors .",
    "the lack of more massive stars may be due to several causes such as : insufficient number of targets ( 50 ) ; underestimation of luminosities due to errors in the kinematic distances or in the method of magnitude extraction .",
    "problems with the kinematic distances of star forming regions have been pointed out by authors who derive spectrophotometric and trigonometric distances ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "kinematic distances are half the magnitude of the kinematic ones .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the kinematic distances are larger than their non - kinematic counterparts mostly due to two reasons : a ) breaking the ambiguity in the far / near distance is not always a reliable procedure for the kinematic distance method , b ) in directions close to the galactic center , where radial velocities are small , local perturbations in the gas produces velocity components of the same magnitude as the galactic rotation . if this result is reliable , than the luminosity of those stars would be @xmath23 4 times smaller than predicted by the original data",
    "unfortunately , mysos in pre - uch phases have not been reported for massive star clusters , where spectrophotometric distances are accurate .    in this paper , we present the results of our survey , which is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the observations and data reduction are described . in section 3 we present overall results from the survey . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the images of the sources presenting extended h@xmath0 emission are shown in the appendix . for those sources that do not display h@xmath0 emission ,",
    "the images are found in the vizier catalogue .",
    "the sample of 353 myso candidates comprises 135 sources located in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath24 ) and 219 from the southern hemisphere ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "most of the northern subsample was observed with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and the southern subsample was observed using the southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) .",
