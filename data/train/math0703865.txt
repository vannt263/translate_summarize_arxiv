    "for many years , @xmath0  restaurants have popularized peg solitaire played on a triangular board with 15  holes .",
    "many patrons have puzzled over this game , often called  an iq test \" , which is surprisingly difficult given its small size and simple rules .",
    "often people resort to a computer program to solve this puzzle , and it is a popular assignment in computer science classes @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider peg solitaire on a triangular board with @xmath1 holes on each side .",
    "this board will be referred to as @xmath2 and can be conveniently presented on an array of hexagons ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the board @xmath2 has @xmath3 holes , where @xmath4 is the @xmath1th triangular number .",
    "the @xmath0 board is @xmath5 .",
    "we will use two different notations to identify the holes in the board .",
    "the notation in figure  [ fig1]a is useful for quick hole identification and for describing solutions .",
    "skew cartesian coordinate \" notation @xcite in figure  [ fig1]b is useful for the theory of the game , as well as inside computer programs .",
    "it is also particularly easy to perform reflections and rotations of the board in this coordinate system ( see appendix  [ rotref ] ) .",
    "note that these two coordinate notations are closely related - skew coordinate to the alphabet ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and concatenate with the @xmath9-skew coordinate plus one . ] .",
    "the game begins with a peg ( or marble ) at every hole except one , called the * starting vacancy*. the player then * jumps * one peg over another into an empty hole on the board , removing the peg that was jumped over .",
    "the game ends when no jump is possible , and the goal is to finish at a one peg position . if the starting vacancy and the ending hole happen to be the same hole , then we call this a * * complement problem**. for example , a popular @xmath5 puzzle is to start with one peg missing in the top corner , and try to finish with one peg in the same corner , the a1-complement problem .",
    "we will use the term * move * for one or more consecutive jumps by the same peg . to denote a jump , we will list the starting and ending coordinates separated by a dash , i.e. , a1-a3 . when the same peg makes two or more jumps in a single move , instead of listing each jump separately ( a1-a3 , a3-c3 , c3-a1 ) we will combine them by writing a1-a3-c3-a1 .",
    "this puzzle is a variant of * square lattice * solitaire , generally played on a 33-hole cross - shaped board @xcite .",
    "both puzzles have the same jumping rules , with the 33-hole board formed from a square lattice of holes , while triangular solitaire is played on a triangular ( or hexagonal ) lattice of holes .",
    "square lattice solitaire has a 300 year history , but the origins of triangular solitaire are more obscure .",
    "triangular solitaire was popularized by a 1966 martin gardner column @xcite , where he considered the game played using a triangular array of pennies on a table .",
    "however , an 1891 patent @xcite indicates that triangular solitaire is quite a bit older .",
    "hentzel @xcite published the first mathematical analysis of the game in 1973 .",
    "in square lattice solitaire , the set of finishing holes is restricted by the so - called * rule of three * @xcite , which states that the @xmath10-coordinates of possible finishing holes differ by a multiple of 3 ( and similarly for the @xmath9-coordinates ) .",
    "the analog of this theory for triangular solitaire was given by hentzel @xcite in 1973 .",
    "generally , this theory is developed using an elegant group - theoretic argument @xcite .",
    "we will use a simpler parity argument to prove our results .",
    "[ th1 ] on the triangular board @xmath2 with @xmath11 , beginning from a vacancy with skew - coordinates @xmath12 , the following conditions are equivalent : a ) the board is not solvable to one peg;b ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "_ proof _ ( @xmath15 ) : label the holes in the board with the pattern in figure  [ fig2 ] , where a hole with skew coordinates @xmath16 is labeled @xmath17 . this labeling pattern was chosen because every jump involves exactly one hole of each of the three labels .",
    "let @xmath18 be the number of pegs in the holes labeled @xmath19 .",
    "after a jump is executed , two of the three @xmath18 decrease by 1 , while the other increases by 1 .",
    "therefore , if we add any pair among @xmath20 , the parity ( even or odd ) of this sum can not change as the game is played .",
    "we can represent the three invariant parities as the binary 3-vector @xmath21 , where each component is taken modulo 2 .",
    "we can partition the set of all possible board positions into four equivalence classes , called * position classes*. during a solitaire game the board position remains in the same position class .",
    "moreover , there is a simple board position which can be chosen as a representative of each position class .",
    "the four position classes are defined by the values of @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "other alternatives , such as @xmath26 , can never occur , because it is impossible to have all three sums odd , or exactly one sum odd .",
    "the empty board lies in the position class @xmath27 , while any board position with a single peg at a hole labeled @xmath19 lies in class @xmath28 ( in this sense we can refer to the label @xmath19 as the _ position class of the hole _ ) .",
    "the position class @xmath27 is the only position class which has no representative with a single peg .",
    "therefore , _ no board position in class _ @xmath27 _ can be reduced to a single peg _ using peg solitaire jumps .",
    "so when is a board position with one peg missing in the class @xmath27 ?",
    "if @xmath29 then the full board is in class @xmath27 , so if we remove a peg labeled @xmath19 in figure  [ fig2 ] , we are in class @xmath28 , and can only finish with one peg at a hole labeled @xmath19 .",
    "triangular boards @xmath2 with @xmath13 are the only triangular boards with a central hole , and are also characterized by having a total number of holes not divisible by 3 . if @xmath13 then the full board is in class @xmath30 .",
    "if we remove any peg labeled @xmath31 , the board is in position class @xmath27 , and can not be solved to a single peg .",
    "any corner vacancy , as well as the central vacancy , is always in position class @xmath27 .",
    "thus , _ no central vacancy problem is solvable on any triangular board _ , a conclusion also reached by beasley @xcite . it is easy to check that if we remove a peg labeled @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , we are in class @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . thus if we remove a peg at @xmath33 , we can only finish with one peg at a hole labeled @xmath32 , and if we remove a peg at @xmath32 , we can only finish with one peg at a hole labeled @xmath33 .",
    "this proves @xmath15 in theorem  [ th1 ] . to complete the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] , it suffices to show that any @xmath2 with @xmath11 satisfying @xmath36 or @xmath13 and @xmath37 can be solved down to one peg ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this part of the proof will be completed in section  [ finish_th1 ] .",
    "any starting vacancy which does not satisfy condition b will be called a * feasible * starting vacancy , because it can potentially be solved down to one peg .",
    "we could also select a particular finishing hole and consider pairs of starting and finishing holes that meet the above parity requirements , called a * feasible pair*. the following theorem tells us when it is possible to play between a feasible pair of holes .    [ th2 ] consider the triangular board @xmath2 with starting vacancy @xmath12 and finishing hole @xmath39 .",
    "then the following is a necessary condition for this problem to be solvable:1 ) if @xmath13 , then @xmath37 and @xmath40 , or2 ) if @xmath36 , then @xmath41.in addition , for @xmath42 , the above condition is also sufficient .",
    "_ proof _ : that the condition is necessary is a restatement of the parity arguments just presented . for example , the condition @xmath41 specifies that the starting and finishing board positions must be in the same position class . for an alternative proof using an algebraic argument ,",
    "see duncan and hayes @xcite .",
    "the sufficient part of the proof must show that when @xmath42 any feasible pair is in fact solvable , and this will be given in section  [ finish_th2 ] .    for a given board size @xmath1 , we need some way of accounting for all possible feasible pairs ( not duplicating pairs equivalent by reflection and/or rotation of the board ) .",
    "a useful fact is that for @xmath36 , we can cover all possible cases by considering _ only starting vacancies and finishing holes in position class _ @xmath30 .",
    "the reason why this works is because each of the three corners is in a different position class .",
    "if @xmath13 , then we can take all starting vacancies in position class @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) .",
    "we conclude this section with a theorem about the symmetry of board positions that can appear during solutions .",
    "[ th3 ] consider the triangular board @xmath2 with @xmath36 .",
    "a solution to any problem finishing with one peg can not pass through a board position with @xmath43 rotational symmetry .",
    "_ proof _ : on @xmath2 with @xmath36 it is easy to see that any board position with @xmath43 rotational symmetry must have @xmath44 , so is in position class @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , no rotationally symmetric board position can be reduced to one peg .",
    "[ co1 ] on any triangular board @xmath2 , the solution to a complement problem can never pass through a board position with @xmath43 rotational symmetry .",
    "the 10-hole board @xmath45 is the smallest triangular board on which a problem beginning with one peg missing is solvable to one peg .",
    "this board falls in the first category of theorem  [ th2 ] , and this theorem gives us three geometrically distinct problems that are potentially solvable : beginning at a2 and finishing at b2 , a3 , or c4 .",
    "one interesting property of this board is that there is no way to move a peg to the center b3 .",
    "consequently , a solution must include exactly one jump over b3 .",
    "all other jumps originate or end at corners , and it is not hard to see that two corners must have two jumps leaving them and one into them , while the third corner has one jump leaving it .",
    "this accounts for all eight jumps in a solution .",
    "figure  [ fig3]c shows a useful parity count on this board .",
    "the parity count @xmath46 is the parity ( even or odd ) of the number of pegs in the holes marked @xmath46",
    ". the only way to change this parity is using the jump a3-c3 , or c3-a3 .",
    "there are two other similar parity counts obtained by rotating the board .",
    "it is easy to check that any solution from the a2 vacancy to a3 must change _ all three _ parity counts .",
    "this is impossible since the peg at b3 can only be removed once  any solution changes exactly one of the three parities .",
    "the other two problems do involve changing one of the parities , and this implies that a solution to the problem from a2 to b2 ( if it exists ) must contain the jump a3-c3 or c3-a3 , and a solution to the problem from a2 to c4 must contain a2-c4 or c4-a2 .",
    "the first problem is solvable ( appendix  [ tn_sols ] ) but the second is not .",
    "i have not found a simple argument showing that the second problem is unsolvable .",
    "however , it is easy to verify by calculating the game tree by hand or using a computer program @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 , or @xmath0 board , is one of the most interesting triangular boards .",
    "it is ( too ) easy to write a short program to find solutions on this board .",
    "consider , for example , the problem starting and finishing in a corner , the a1-complement .",
    "a program can find all solutions in a fraction of a second , one of which is given in appendix  [ tn_sols ] .",
    "this solution has been converted , each jump is specified by an ordered pair of the beginning and ending holes .",
    "the solution is then a sequence of @xmath47 such ordered pairs , or 26 integers . ]",
    "to integer sequence http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/~njas/sequences/eisa.cgi?anum=a120422 [ ] in oeis @xcite .",
    "a program can count that there are @xmath48 distinct solutions to the a1-complement .",
    "a second solution is given by the sequence of jumps : ( a3-a1 , c5-a3 , a5-c5 , d5-b5 , c3-c5 , b5-d5 , e5-c5 , a1-c3 , d4-b2 , a4-a2 , b2-b4 , c5-a3-a1 ) .",
    "in fact , _ any solution _ to the a1-complement is either a permutation of the jumps of one of these two solutions , or its reflection about the @xmath9-axis is . in this sense",
    "there are only _ two _ solutions to the a1-complement .",
    "most people lose interest in this puzzle once they have found a solution .",
    "however , additional theory yields many useful insights .",
    "a pagoda function @xcite is a real - valued function of the board position that can not increase as the game is played . in 1986 ,",
    "hentzel and hentzel @xcite discovered a powerful pagoda function on this board .",
    "suppose we consider the hole - weighting shown in figure  [ fig4]c , and sum up the weights where a peg is present .",
    "this function is not a pagoda function because a jump along the edge , over one of the holes marked ",
    "@xmath49 \" can increase it .",
    "however we can remedy this by adding  @xmath50 \" to our function for each 3-hole colored ( or shaded ) edge region which contains two or three pegs .",
    "it is not hard to show that this function can never increase , no matter what the starting board position is and what jump is executed @xcite .",
    "as defined by hentzel and hentzel @xcite , we compute the sax count as @xmath51 where:@xmath52 @xmath53 is the number of colored edge regions with two or more pegs ( @xmath54).@xmath52 @xmath55 is the number of pegs occupying holes labeled  @xmath50 \" in figure  [ fig4]c.@xmath52 @xmath56 is the number of pegs occupying holes labeled  @xmath49 \" in figure  [ fig4]c.note that if the entire board is filled , the sax count is @xmath57 .",
    "if a board position has only a single peg , then the sax count is simply the value of that hole in figure  [ fig4]c . for any board position",
    "@xmath58 , if we take the * complement * of @xmath58 ( where every peg is replaced by a hole and vice versa ) , then the sax count of the complemented position is @xmath59 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows all 17 distinct feasible starting and ending pairs on @xmath5 . the * slack * is the difference between the sax count of the starting board position and the sax count of the ending board position . in the case where we begin at a corner ( say a1 ) , the starting sax count is @xmath50 , but the first jump must be a3-a1 ( or the symmetric c3-a1 ) , and the sax count is zero after this jump is made .",
    "we define the * effective slack * as the difference between the starting and final sax count when the effect of these forced jumps at the start or finish is taken into account .",
    "the effective slack is one less than the slack when the game begins at a corner , and one less when it ends at a corner .",
    ".the 17 distinct feasible pairs on @xmath5 starting with one peg missing and finishing with one peg .",
    "only 12 are solvable .",
    "note that all problems are in position class @xmath30 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     determining the value of @xmath60 computationally involves several steps .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , we first apply the search algorithm to look for solutions of length 17 ( or less ) at all geometrically distinct starting vacancies from among @xmath62 feasible pairs , there are twelve geometrically distinct starting vacancies .",
    "however , @xmath63 , so an application of theorem  [ th2 ] finds that six of these can not be reduced to one peg .",
    "so for @xmath61 we need only check the starting vacancies : a2 , a3 , a5 , b4 , b5 and c6 . ] . if all searches finish with no solution found , we know @xmath64 .",
    "the next step is to run the search algorithm to find a solution of length 18 .",
    "this is the most time consuming step .    for @xmath65",
    ", our search algorithm can determine that no solution of length 18 exists .",
    "searching for a solution of length 19 is , however , too difficult , and the algorithm runs for several days before running out of disk space .",
    "the shortest known solution for @xmath65 has 28 moves @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the special problem where the board begins from a position with one peg missing , and finishes with one peg .",
    "we have found necessary and sufficient conditions for such problems to be solvable on any size triangular board .",
    "moreover , for all solvable problems we have given a fast solution algorithm which does not rely on exhaustive search , but builds a solution in an inductive manner using solutions on smaller boards ( which are pre - computed for the smallest size boards ) .",
    "these solution extension techniques can also be applied to other board shapes besides triangular , such as rhombus @xcite and hexagonal .",
    "similar ideas for extending solutions can also be applied in square lattice solitaire .",
    "a modified trapezoid purge is needed for this case , and one possibility is the 15-hole board formed by a @xmath66 square board with the upper right corner removed , with the three holes in the top row forming the unlike catalyst . as in section  [ finish_th1 ] , solutions on rectangular boards can be extended using this new purge together with the usual 3- and 6-purges .",
    "a more general problem is to determine if an _",
    "arbitrary _ configuration of pegs can be reduced to a single peg .",
    "it has been proved ( for the case of an @xmath67 square board ) that this problem is np - complete @xcite . from a practical standpoint this means we can not hope to find a fast ( polynomial speed )",
    "algorithm for solving this general problem .",
    "what we have presented here is a small subset of problems that can be solved much more quickly .",
    "finally , we have considered the problem of finding the shortest solution ( in moves ) to any problem beginning with one peg missing and finishing with one peg .",
    "this is a much more difficult task than finding any solution , and we have shown how it can be solved ( up to @xmath68 ) using computational search techniques .",
    "i thank pablo guerrero - garca of the university of mlaga ( spain ) and the anonymous referee , for many useful comments which improved this paper .",
    "many starting board positions are equivalent by reflection and/or rotation of the board . for the triangular board @xmath2",
    ", we consider a reflection @xmath69 about the vertical axis , and a rotation @xmath70 counter - clockwise by @xmath43 .",
    "these transformations are useful inside programs to convert solutions . in skew",
    "coordinates these two coordinate transformations have a simple form , given by @xmath71    note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath19 is the identity transformation .",
    "there are six different transformations of the board , given by the generators @xmath74 .",
    "for example , on @xmath5 one feasible pair is @xmath75 , in skew coordinates this pair is @xmath76 . by applying a rotation",
    ", we obtain an equivalent feasible pair , @xmath77 .",
    "the six transformations above generate the equivalent set of six feasible pairs ( converted to alphanumeric notation ) : @xmath78 .",

    "these seemingly obvious statements are called the * exit theorems * @xcite and prove surprisingly powerful .",
    "comments from john beasley , december 2008 : * * section 2.2 , @xmath45 problem  vacate a2 , finish at c4\"**consider the set of holes @xmath85 .",
    "this is a closed set , in the sense that no peg can jump into it from outside , so the number of pegs in these holes can never increase .",
    "we start with two and we must end with one , so we can only lose one in the course of the solution .",
    "now consider the region @xmath86 .",
    "this starts full and ends empty , so we need two exits from it . however , by your own parity argument , the move across b3 must be a2-c4 or c4-a2 , so neither b2-b4 nor c3-a3 is available , and the only other possibilities , a1-a3 and d4-b4 , each remove a peg from the set @xmath85 .",
    "hence the problem is unsolvable .    * * section 2.3 , the sax count on @xmath5**the sax count can be derived from an entirely different perspective by counting exits to six carefully chosen regions .",
    "consider the six regions consisting of the three corners @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 plus the  edge regions \" @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ". we call the pegs in @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 the  fodder pegs \" ; for any particular board position , let @xmath102 be the number of fodder pegs .",
    "the reason for this name is that _ any exit from these six regions necessarily consumes a fodder peg_. two important details are that _ the number of fodder pegs can never increase _",
    "( they form a closed set ) , and an exit from one region can not also be an exit from a different region .",
    "this immediately provides a simple proof that the b3-complement is unsolvable  for we need 9 exits from the six regions , yet we have only 8 fodder pegs at the start and must finish with 1 fodder peg .",
    "in fact , from any board position we can do an accounting of the remaining fodder pegs @xmath102 and subtract the number of remaining exits , i call this the  @xmath103 count \" . specifically , to calculate @xmath104 we take the number of corners occupied , and for each edge region , add + 2 if this region is full , + 1 if the region contains 1 or 2 pegs , and 0 if it is empty .",
    "because each exit consumes a fodder peg , and the number of fodder pegs can never increase , this proves that the @xmath103 count can not increase .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to show that the @xmath103 count is _ identical _ to the sax count !    this embeds the mysterious sax count in a more general framework of regions and exits which is applicable to any board . the proof that it can never increase is automatic and does not require a case - by - case analysis as for the sax count @xcite .",
    "in addition , remarks 3 and 4 lower down on page 7 ( of this paper ) can be rephrased in terms of exits and the fullness or emptiness of the three - hole edge region affected , when they are perhaps more readily comprehended .    *",
    "* section 3.1 , the trapezoid purge**i think you are doing yourself a slight injustice in calling this  more difficult to remember \" . consider the following : since uuu are unlike , at least one of them must be empty .",
    "this gives us a catalyst for the 3-purge a4/b4/c4 .    by the same argument",
    ", at least one of uuu must be full .",
    "suppose first that a3 is full ; then we play c6-c4 , e6-c6 , b6-d6 , c4-e6-c6 , reducing to a * hollow v * a6/a5/b5/c6 hinged on a4 , and the combination ",
    "a3 full , a4 empty \" gives us a catalyst to purge it ( a6-a4 , a3-a5 , c6-a4 , a5-a3 ) .",
    "if instead , b3 or c3 is full , we play to leave the hollow v on c6/c5/d5/e6 ."
