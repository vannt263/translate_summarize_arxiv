    "the vision of animals provides a large amount of information that improves the perception of the world .",
    "this information is processed into different dimensions , including color , shape , illumination , and motion .",
    "while most of the features provide information about the static world , the motion provides essential information for interaction with external environment . in recent decades , the perception and interpretation of motion",
    "have attracted a significant interest in computer vision community @xcite motivated by the importance in both scientific and industrial communities . despite significant advances ,",
    "the motion characterization is still an open problem .    for modeling image sequences , three classes of motion patterns",
    "have been suggested @xcite : dynamic texture , activities and events .",
    "the main difference between them relies on the temporal and spatial regularity of the motion field . in this work",
    ", we aim at modeling dynamic textures , also called temporal textures .",
    "they are basically texture in motion which is an extension of image texture to the spatiotemporal domain .",
    "examples of dynamic texture includes real world scenes of fire , flag blowing , sea waves , moving escalator , boiling water , grass , and steam .",
    "existing methods for dynamic texture can be classified into four categories according to how they model the sequence of images . due to the efficient estimation of features based on motion ( e.g. optical flow ) ,",
    "the motion based methods ( i ) are the most popular ones .",
    "these methods model dynamic textures based on a sequence of motion patterns @xcite . for modeling dynamic texture at different scales in space and time , the spatiotemporal filtering based methods",
    "( ii ) use spatiotemporal filters such as wavelet transform @xcite .",
    "model based methods ( iii ) are generally based on linear dynamical systems , which provides a model that can be used in applications of segmentation , synthesis , and classification @xcite .",
    "based on properties of moving contour surfaces , spatiotemporal geometric property based methods ( iv ) extract motion and appearance features from the tangent plane distribution @xcite .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for a review of dynamic texture methods . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach for dynamic texture modeling based on spatiotemporal gabor filters @xcite .",
    "as far as the authors know , the present paper is the first one to model dynamic texture using spatiotemporal gabor filters .",
    "these filters are basically built using two parameters : the speed @xmath0 and direction @xmath1 .",
    "to model a dynamic texture , we convolve the sequence of images to a bank of spatiotemporal gabor filter built with different values of speed and direction . for each response , a feature vector is built by calculating the energy statistic .",
    "we evaluate the proposed method by classifying dynamic texture from two challenging databases : dyntex @xcite and traffic database @xcite .",
    "experimental results in both databases indicate that the proposed method is an effective approach for dynamic texture recognition . for the dyntex database , filter with low speeds ( e.g. 0.1 pixels / frame ) achieved better results than high speeds .",
    "in fact , the dynamic texture in this database presents low motion patterns . on the other hand , for the traffic database , high speeds ( e.g. 1.5 pixels / frame ) achieved the best correct classification rate . in this database ,",
    "vehicles are moving at a speed that matches the filter s speed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly describes spatiotemporal gabor filters . in section 3",
    ", we present the proposed method for dynamic texture recognition based on spatiotemporal gabor filters .",
    "an analysis of the proposed method with respect to the speed and direction parameters is present in section 4 .",
    "experimental results are given in section 5 , which is followed by the conclusion of this work in section 6 .",
    "gabor filters are based on the important finding made by hubel and wiesel in the beginning of the 1960s .",
    "they found that the neurons of the primary visual cortex respond to lines or edges of a certain orientation in different positions of the visual field . following this discovery ,",
    "computational models were proposed for modeling the function of this neurons and the gabor functions proved to be suited for this purpose in many works .    initially , the researches aimed at studying spatial properties of the receptive field .",
    "however , some posterior studies revealed that cortical cells change in time and some of them are inseparable functions of space and time .",
    "therefore , these cells are essentially spatiotemporal filters and they combine information over space and time , which makes a great model for dynamic texture analysis .    in this work ,",
    "the spatiotemporal receptive field is modeled by a family of 3d gabor filters @xcite described in equation [ eq : gabor ] .",
    "@xmath2    we now discuss the parameters of the spatiotemporal gabor filter . some parameters were empirically found based on studies of response in the receptive visual field @xcite .",
    "the size of the receptive field is determined by the standard deviation @xmath3 of the gaussian factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the rate that specifies the ellipticity of the gaussian envelope in the spatial domain .",
    "this parameter is set to @xmath5 for match to the elongated receptive field along @xmath6 axis .",
    "the speed @xmath0 is the phase speed of the cosine factor , which determines the speed of motion .",
    "the speed which the center of the spatial gaussian moves along the @xmath7 axis is specified by the parameter @xmath8 . when @xmath9 , the center of the gaussian envelope is stationary . on the other hand ,",
    "a moving envelope is obtained when @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : movingenvelope ] presents a moving envelope with @xmath11 .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] + .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the parameter @xmath12 is the wavelength of the cosine factor . it is obtained through the relation @xmath13 , where the constant @xmath14 . the angle @xmath15 $ ] determines the direction of motion and the spatial orientation of the filter .",
    "the phase offset @xmath16 $ ] determines the symmetry in the spatial domain . the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath17 and standard deviation @xmath18 is used to model the change in intensities .",
    "the mean @xmath19 and standard deviation @xmath20 , both parameters are fixed based on the mean duration of most receptive fields .",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed method for dynamic texture modeling based on spatiotemporal gabor filters . briefly , the sequence of images is convolved with a bank of spatiotemporal gabor filters and a feature vector is constructed with the energy of the responses as components .",
    "the response @xmath21 of a spatiotemporal gabor filter @xmath22 to a sequence of images @xmath23 is computed by convolution :    @xmath24    spatiotemporal gabor filters are phase sensitive because its response to a moving pattern depends on the exact position within the sequence of images .",
    "to overcome this drawback , a response that is phase insensitive can be obtained by : @xmath25    to characterize the gabor space resulting from the convolution , the energy of the response is computed according to equation [ eq : energy ] .",
    "@xmath26    a central issue in applying spatiotemporal gabor filters is the determination of the filter parameters that covers the spatiotemporal frequency space , and captures dynamic texture information as much as possible .",
    "each spatiotemporal gabor filter is determined by two main parameters : the direction @xmath1 and the speed of motion @xmath0 . in order to cover a wide range of dynamic textures , we design a bank of spatiotemporal gabor filter using a set of values for speed @xmath27 $ ] and direction @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the feature vector that characterizes the dynamic texture is composed by the energy of the response for each combination of velocities @xmath29 and direction @xmath30 ( equation [ eq : featurevector ] ) .",
    "@xmath31\\ ] ]    the proposed method is summarized in figure [ fig : metodo ] .",
    "first , we design a bank of spatiotemporal gabor filters composed by filters with different directions and speeds .",
    "then , the sequence of images is convolved with the bank of filters . for each convolved sequence of images ,",
    "we calculate the energy to compose a feature vector .     and direction @xmath1 ; ( ii ) convolve the sequence of images with the bank of filters ; ( iii ) calculate the energy for each response to compose the feature vector .",
    "here , we analyze the speed and direction properties of the spatiotemporal gabor filters in synthetic sequence of images . in figure [ fig : directionresponse ] , we present the response of spatiotemporal gabor filters to bars moving at the same speed but in different direction @xmath1 .",
    "the filters and the moving bars have preference for the same speed @xmath32 .",
    "the response has the highest magnitude when the direction of the filter @xmath1 matches the direction of the moving bar .",
