    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , without additional theoretical assumptions , the necessary breakdown of supersymmetry leads to a large number of arbitrary parameters , consisting of all possible renormalizable soft supersymmetry breaking terms  @xcite .",
    "the latter arbitrariness simply reflects our present ignorance of the fundamental mechanism underlying the breakdown of supersymmetry .",
    "although several theoretically appealing scenarios have been explored , with additional assumptions considerably reducing the arbitrariness of the soft susy - breaking sector ( typically like in hidden sector supergravity models  @xcite , or gauge - mediated susy breaking models  @xcite ) , alternative strategies may be useful to exploit the information from the present and future collider data .",
    "if susy is realized at low energy in some way , and some super - partners discovered , the next immediate task would be to reconstruct from the data the structure of the susy and soft - susy breaking lagrangian [ that is , to determine as precisely as possible how the experimentally measured parameters would translate as possible values ( or bounds ) on the mssm lagrangian parameters . ]",
    "+ the expressions of physical parameters ( mass eigenvalues , mixing angles and physical couplings ) as functions of the most general , unconstrained mssm lagrangian , are well known  @xcite .",
    "now , inverting those relations ( i.e. expressing the lagrangian parameters in terms of physical parameters ) is non trivial in the unconstrained mssm , due to the large number of parameters and possible mixing among them .",
    "this is especially true in the ino sector which involves a relatively complicated structure of the mixing terms , with e.g. a 4 x 4 mass matrix to  de  diagonalize \" in the neutralino sector . to our knowledge",
    ", no systematic analytical inversion has been explored up to now .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is twofold :    * investigate as much as possible analytically the reconstruction of the lagrangian parameters from the physical masses , especially in the ino sector , identifying clearly the procedure and the related ambiguities when they occur ; * construct a numerical code based on algorithms using as much as possible the above mentioned results , and which can be readily used for a full numerical study of the lagrangian parameters as a function of the physical masses .    for definiteness we will restrict ourselves throughout the paper to the ( cp and r - parity conserving ) unconstrained mssm . also to simplify the presentation we will consider two illustrative `` scenarios '' where either two chargino and one neutralino masses , or one chargino and two neutralino masses are input .",
    "the outcome is a well  defined algorithm providing , for given @xmath0 , the values of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters in terms of three arbitrary input masses .",
    "furthermore , one of our main results is the derivation , in terms of simple analytic expressions , of the full neutralino mass spectrum and one of the lagrangian parameters ( @xmath2 ) , when the three other parameters ( @xmath4 ) and one neutralino mass are given .",
    "this together with the analytical expressions of the chargino sector constitute the building blocks of our algorithms . + it should be stressed here that we are not aiming , in this paper , at a specific phenomenological reconstruction of the mssm parameters from experimental observables .",
    "clearly an algebraic approach can not replace more systematic phenomenological studies of the reconstruction of the basic mssm parameters .",
    "various experimental strategies to extract the mssm physical spectrum from present and future collider data have been considered , together with a detailed assessment on mass measurements , e.g. , in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a complete scanning of the unconstrained mssm parameters would be in practice rather tedious and extremely time consuming .",
    "we believe that our study would be useful and rather flexible for such reconstructions : besides the fact of providing a fast numerical inversion routine , we systematically encode the possible ambiguities that can arise through the reconstruction from some of the physical masses . in the most optimistic case ( that is , if knowing a sufficient number of physical input ino masses and with sufficient accuracy ) , this inversion allows for a precise reconstruction of the unconstrained mssm ino sector lagrangian .",
    "if a more limited experimental information of the ino spectrum were available , such as only mass bounds or mass differences typically , one could still derive corresponding constraints on the mssm lagrangian parameters as well .",
    "+ our input / output parameters are deliberately chosen so as to render the analytical inversion the most simple and transparent . as will be explained in details later on , our algorithms will be either fully analytical , in which case at most a readily solvable _",
    "equation is involved ( in contrast with the generically quartic one in the ordinary diagonalization of the neutralino sector  @xcite ) , or needs some numerical iteration , in which case it relies essentially on a system of two algebraic equations , that are only _ quadratic _ ( in contrast with a  brute force \" inversion , which would involve a highly non  linear set of equations ) .",
    "it thus demonstrates the feasibility and relative simplicity of such a systematic inversion and more importantly we also exhibit the general trend and sensitivity of the lagrangian parameters to the physical masses .",
    "note , however , that we do not assume at this level any knowledge of the couplings of inos to higgses and gauge bosons .",
    "these would of course lead to extra information @xcite which together with our results could allow an even more complete reconstruction and cross - checks for the ino sector . + the rest of the paper",
    "is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly recall the main content of the mssm lagrangian , just to fix our definitions and conventions . in section 3",
    ", we present our main results for the analytic inversion of the ino parameters , and discuss uniqueness conditions .",
    "some essentially technical material is given in two appendices . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the dependence of the ino sector lagrangian parameters , as functions of the relevant physical input masses .",
    "we also illustrate some resulting values of the ino lagrangian parameters at a grand unification ( gut ) scale . in section 5",
    "we briefly outline , for completeness , similar inversion relations in the scalar fermion and higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "finally section 6 presents the conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the supersymmetric part of the unconstrained mssm lagrangian consists of the gauged kinetic terms for the @xmath5 vector multiplets , involving the three gauge couplings @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively , the gauge invariant kinetic term of matter fields , and the superpotential : [ superw ] w = y_t _ u - y_b _ d - y _ _ d + _ u _ d . in eq .",
    "( [ superw ] ) , the hats denote superfields , @xmath9 are the yukawa couplings , and @xmath10 , ( with @xmath11 ) fixes our sign convention for @xmath1 . in ( [ superw ] ) and in the following",
    "we will in fact neglect all flavor non - diagonal terms .",
    "we also suppress any flavor , color , etc indices .",
    "moreover , we will restrict here to the case where all parameters are assumed to be real .",
    "+ the soft susy - breaking terms involve + the trilinear coupling terms : [ lsofttri ] l_trilinear = -(a_t y_t h_u + a_b y_b",
    "h_d + a_y_h_d + h.c . ) ; involving the @xmath12 parameters ( which have a mass dimension in this convention ) ; + a contribution to the sfermion mass terms : [ lsfermion ] l_sfermion = -m^2_q ( ^_l _ l + ^_l _ l ) -m^2_t_r ^_r _ r - m^2_b_r ^_r _",
    "r + -m^2_l ( ^_l _ l + ^_l _ l ) -m^2__r ^_r _ r and the gaugino mass terms : + [ lgaugino ] l_gaugino = - - ^i _ i - ^a _ a ; which fixes our sign conventions .",
    "there are also supersymmetric contributions to the ino masses , of which we write here for illustration only the ones contributing to neutralinos ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath17 .",
    "it is now easy to see from eqs.([lgaugino ] , [ lneutralino ] ) that only the relative phases of say @xmath18 and @xmath19 are physically relevant .",
    "indeed any phase change of @xmath3 in eq.([lgaugino ] ) can always be absorbed by a phase change of the @xmath20 field .",
    "the latter however fixes uniquely the phase change of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq.([lneutralino ] ) in such a way that the phases of the combinations @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain unchanged .",
    "the discussion is of course reminiscent of the one carried out for instance in  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "as already mentioned , we restrict ourselves to real - valued parameters , but do not necessarily assume universality of gaugino masses .",
    "we can thus choose , without loss of generality , @xmath3 to be _ always positive _ and @xmath2 and @xmath1 to have arbitrary signs .",
    "+ finally , the higgs potential is built from soft susy breaking and f - term contributions to the higgs scalar mass terms plus quadrilinear d - terms , and reads , before @xmath26 breaking : [ vhiggs ] v_higgs = ( m^2_h_d + ^2 ) h_d ^2 + ( m^2_h_u + ^2 ) h_u ^2 + ( b h_u h_d + h.c . ) + + ( h_d ^2 -h_u ^2 ) ^2 + h^i_d h_u , i ^2 + v^1-loop_eff which also fixes a sign convention for the @xmath27 parameter , and where @xmath28 is the one - loop contribution to the effective potential  @xcite . the corresponding higgs masses and mixing angles ( after electroweak symmetry breaking )",
    "are given in appendix 1 .",
    "let us first sketch our general procedure to reconstruct the ino sector parameters .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we have to fix a specific choice of input / output parameters , that we do as follows .",
    "we first assume that @xmath0 is an input parameter at this stage , i.e. that it has been extracted from elsewhere prior to ino reconstruction , or simply fixed arbitrarily .",
    "( obviously , once a reconstruction algorithm is defined for fixed @xmath0 , one may always study the sensitivity to this parameter ) .",
    "then , we consider two basic scenarios , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the corresponding algorithms .",
    "* the input are _ two _ chargino masses , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and one ( but any ) of the neutralino masses , @xmath33 . *",
    "the input are a single chargino mass , @xmath31 , and two neutralino masses , say @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note here that we will adopt the formulation in which the eigenvalues of the chargino mass matrix are by construction always positive , while those of the neutralino mass matrix can have either signs .",
    "this means that in the inversion process one should consider both @xmath33 as possible inputs [ a feature consistently taken into account in the formulae we derive . ]    for each of the above scenarios the aim will be to identify a corresponding algorithm which allows the determination of the output values of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , as well as the remaining three neutralino masses ( resp .",
    "two neutralinos and one chargino masses ) in the @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) case .",
    "+ first , as we will show in detail below and in appendix [ app2 ] , scenario @xmath29 allows a fully analytical algorithm to handle all the features of the inversion procedure .",
    "algorithm @xmath29 will therefore be our starting point for the whole study .",
    "we stress , however , that it does not necessarily imply a strong prejudice on the  chronology \" of discovery of the inos since , as we shall explain , it may also be used as a basic building block for a probably more phenomenologically relevant situation , in scenario @xmath30 below .",
    "[ furthermore , we will see that @xmath29 can be naturally separated into two independent steps corresponding to chargino and neutralino sectors .",
    "it can thus also be readily used in a more general context than the one of the present paper ] .",
    "+ to scenario @xmath30 we associate the following algorithm : first assuming _ temporarily _ that e.g. @xmath1 is an input parameter , together with two neutralino masses , say @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then a simple quadratic system gives @xmath3 , @xmath2 as function of the latter input , as well as all other ino masses .",
    "now , the key observation is that it is relatively simple to merge the solutions of the latter system with the previous algorithm @xmath29 , to obtain consistently @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 from a single chargino mass , @xmath31 , and two neutralino masses , say @xmath36 , @xmath37 input . more precisely , choosing an adequate  initial guess \" value for e.g. @xmath3 one can simply use @xmath29 ( actually only a part of it ) to determine @xmath1 in terms of ( @xmath31 , @xmath3 ) , followed by the above mentioned @xmath2 , @xmath3 solutions , iterating with respect to @xmath3 until a convergent set of values is obtained   is a ( high degree ) polynomial .",
    "non convergent domains thus simply correspond to the impossibility to match our basic assumption of real @xmath38 . ] .",
    "while @xmath29 was fully analytical , the price to pay is that , accordingly , @xmath30 has to be partly numerical through the iterative procedure . in most cases ,",
    "this combined algorithm turns out to converge rapidly , after 2 to 3 iterations for an accuracy that is sufficient for all practical purposes . + this particular decomposition , with",
    "this choice of input / output , is the one giving the most algebraically tractable inversion in the ino sector .",
    "in fact , while @xmath29 alone is probably not very relevant physically ( since for a rather generic choice of the lagrangian parameters , it looks more likely to have two neutralinos and one chargino in the lightest part of the ino spectrum  @xcite ) , precisely this situation is tractable from the combined algorithm of scenario @xmath30 , as explained above . however , it is rather instructive to study algorithm @xmath29 separately in some detail , as it exhibits important properties of the inversion in a relatively simple manner .",
    "[ of course it is also possible to use any part of our particular procedures to simply scan over some values , if not known , of some of the ino masses , as will be illustrated in the plots in section 4 ] .",
    "assuming @xmath0 and the two chargino masses given , one easily obtains from the expressions of the chargino mass eigenvalues ( see eq  ( [ mchi12 ] ) in appendix [ app1 ] ) : [ invmu2 ] ^2 = ( m^2_^+_1+m^2_^+_2 - 2m^2_w ^1/2 ) and [ invm2 ] m_2 = [ m^2_^+_1+m^2_^+_2 - 2m^2_w -^2 ] ^1/2 in eqs .",
    "( [ invmu2 ] ) and ( [ invm2 ] ) the @xmath39 ambiguity in front of the square root results from the invariance of the physical masses ( see eq .",
    "( [ mchi12 ] ) of appendix a ) under the substitution @xmath40 ( we stress again our sign convention , @xmath41 in ( [ invm2 ] ) ) . in other words , from the two chargino masses input only , there is clearly no way of assessing the amount of gaugino or higgsinos components of each of them . to achieve this",
    ", one would require the knowledge of mixing angles ( i.e. couplings )  @xcite or alternatively of two neutralino masses , as will be discussed below in scenario @xmath30 .",
    "in what follows , we thus arbitrarily _ choose _ to illustrate only the case @xmath42 ( corresponding to the minus sign choice in front of the square root of ( [ invmu2 ] ) ) , i.e. the case where the lightest chargino has a stronger higgsino like component .",
    "we thus refer to this situation as `` higgsino - like '' .",
    "the resulting output of algorithm @xmath29 corresponding to the opposite `` gaugino - like '' situation , @xmath43 , is therefore trivially obtained by interchanging the values of @xmath44 and @xmath3 ( together with the correct sign of @xmath1 assignment , see e.g. captions of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , since @xmath41 , @xmath2 will have arbitrary sign ( see previous section 2 ) .",
    "[ had we chosen to let the sign of @xmath3 rather than @xmath2 undetermined at this stage , our algorithm would have been slightly more complicated ] .",
    "+ concerning now the sign ambiguity on @xmath1 , it is in fact fixed from another relation from eqs .",
    "( [ mchi12 ] ) ( implicitly used in eq .",
    "( [ invmu2 ] ) ) : [ sgnmu ] m_2 = m^2_w 2 m_^+_1 m_^+_2 for each respective choice of the @xmath45 ambiguity .",
    "the latter @xmath39 , also appearing inside the square root in ( [ invmu2 ] ) , corresponds to a true ambiguity , i.e. whenever the expression under the square root of eq .",
    "( [ invmu2 ] ) is positive for both sign choice , there are two distinct solutions for ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "obviously , the occurrence of this discrete twofold ambiguity depends crucially on the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath0 , and deserves a more careful examination to which we now turn . + we illustrate in table 1 and fig.[fig1 ] the different domains where one obtains either no solutions ( for @xmath1 real ) , a unique solution , or the discrete twofold ambiguity , depending on the input values @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath0 .",
    "what is relevant here are the chargino mass difference @xmath46 and sum @xmath47 , as well as the quantity @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , the last two columns of table 1 summarize respectively the occurrence of the twofold ambiguity or the existence of ( real ) solutions at all . in some zones this is fully controlled by the values of @xmath50 which we expressed in the form of necessary and sufficient constraints on @xmath51 .",
    "this is systematically taken into account in our algorithm , which gives in the relevant case the two possible solutions for @xmath1 .",
    "one then needs an extra information to eventually eliminate one of the solutions .",
    "note finally that in fig.[fig1 ] we assumed for simplicity that @xmath52 which is obviously just a matter of convention . [ in any case , the opposite situation corresponds simply to a symmetry around the bisectrix line . ]",

    "the question we want to answer analytically here , is how to determine @xmath2 and three neutralino masses , when @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath50 and a fourth neutralino mass are given .",
    "we will only outline the procedure leaving some technical details to the appendix . as we shall see , the discussion in this section is quite general and serves indifferently as a basis for the more specific algorithm @xmath29 or @xmath30 . + since we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 are all real - valued , the neutralino mass matrix [ mneutralino ] m = (    cccc m_1 & 0 & -m_z s_w & m_z s_w + 0 & m_2 & m_z c_w & -m_z c_w + -m_z s_w & m_z c_w & 0 & - + m_z s_w & -m_z c_w & - & 0    ) is symmetric and can be diagonalized through a similarity transformation , i.e.    @xmath55    analytical results for this diagonalization are well - known @xcite .",
    "however , a straightforward inversion of the expressions of the mass eigenvalues using these results is far from obvious .",
    "a more manageable alternative is to start from the four quantities @xmath56    which are invariant under any similarity transformation .",
    "these quantities allow one to relate the four mass eigenvalues to the initial parameters in ( [ mneutralino ] ) as follows :    @xmath57    @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    here @xmath61 denote the eigenvalues of the mass matrix eq.([mneutralino ] ) , to be distinguished from the physical neutralino masses @xmath62 given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is undetermined at this level .",
    "we emphasize that eqs.([inv1][inv4 ] ) give the complete information on the relationship between the four neutralino mass eigenvalues and the original parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore these equations are a good starting point for our purpose , as they do not favour _ a priori _ any particular set of parameters .",

    "indeed , @xmath3 is large for large @xmath32 ( since we assume @xmath89 ) . in this limit and for fixed @xmath31 , @xmath36 ( and @xmath0 ) one finds from eqs.([ais]-[sol3 ] ) that the remaining three neutralinos behave like @xmath3 .",
    "one then easily determines the ( constant ) behaviour of @xmath2 from eq.([solm1 ] ) in the large @xmath3 limit , namely @xmath90/(m_{n_2}^2 - \\mu^2)$ ] in summary , the information from the plots in fig .",
    "2 is rather interesting : apart from some small regions , the dependence of @xmath1 , @xmath3 ( and even @xmath2 to some extent ) upon @xmath91 is very simple for a wide range of the latter mass difference . in other words ,",
    "once one chargino mass will be known with some accuracy ( together with @xmath0 ) , fig .",
    "2 indicates that , in principle , the possible values of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 are strongly correlated .",
    "moreover , although in fig 2 we have only varied @xmath32 the behaviour is quite generic and does not change much , qualitatively , when the other fixed inputs ( @xmath36 and @xmath0 ) are varied .",
    "+ finally , as a last illustration of scenario @xmath29 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the resulting values of @xmath2 and the three other neutralino masses , @xmath65 , @xmath37 , @xmath66 , determined from eqs .",
    "( [ solmn1])([solmn3 ] ) .",
    "note that the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are now functions of @xmath36 , and with different @xmath31 , @xmath32 inputs than for fig .",
    "the singularities of @xmath2 for specific values of @xmath36 , correspond simply to the denominator of eq.([solm1 ] ) vanishing ( and also correspond to the exchange among neutralino masses , as illustrated on the plots ) .",
    "apart from relatively small regions around the singularities , the almost linear dependence of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath36 can be traced back to the fact that @xmath2 behaves , for asymptotically large @xmath36 in eq.([solm1 ] ) , as @xmath92 + o(\\frac{1}{m_{n_2}^2 } ) \\label{asymptotm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is any of the neutralino masses other than @xmath36 .",
    "strictly speaking , ( [ asymptotm1 ] ) is valid only if the @xmath93 s become insensitive to the value of @xmath36 in this limit . that this is true can be easily seen from the fact that all the @xmath94 s in eq.([ais ] ) behave in this limit like @xmath95 .",
    "then the dependence on @xmath36 tends to cancel out in eq.([cubiceq ] ) , making the three neutralino masses insensitive to this parameter , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we illustrate plots very similar to the ones in fig . [ fig2 ] , but where in addition the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 have been evolved from a low scale , @xmath96 200 gev , to a gut scale , @xmath97 gev according to the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) @xcite . in order to illustrate as simply as possible some representative values after rg evolution",
    ", note that we have made a number of approximations for the evolution itself , that we feel are reasonable for the present purpose .",
    "namely , the rg evolution is limited to the one - loop approximation , and we have assumed in addition a single , universal supersymmetric threshold , that is identified with the low energy scale , @xmath96 200 gev , where the evolution starts ( so that the rg evolution is dictated by fully supersymmetric beta function coefficients between @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "there should be no difficulties in principle to incorporate in our framework more realistic supersymmetric threshold effects , provided however that the masses of other partners ( higgses and sfermions ) are known at this stage in addition to ino masses .",
    "the latter refinements should however produce relatively small corrections to the numerical values that are illustrated in fig .",
    "+ it should not be very surprising that rge scarcely change the shape of the various plots , with respect to those in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , apart from a systematic shift and a slight change in the slopes .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the generic form of the one - loop evolution equations for the gaugino masses and the @xmath1 parameter , namely @xmath100 where @xmath101 refers to either gauge or yukawa couplings and @xmath102 is the evolution parameter .",
    "taking into account the evolution of the couplings themselves , one then expects the mass parameters to behave like @xmath103 where @xmath94 is some numerical power and @xmath104 the mass parameter at some initial scale.[the latter behaviour is exact , at the one - loop level , for the gauge couplings and also for the yukawa couplings at least in the small @xmath50 regime .",
    "] thus the only effect of the running is a coupling dependent rescaling of the inversion results .",
    "next we illustrate the ( probably phenomenologically more relevant ) scenario @xmath30 , namely with @xmath31 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as input .",
    "as expected , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] reflects the more algebraically involved inversion from the combined algorithm @xmath30 ( with unknown @xmath105 ) , with the possible occurrence of several distinct solutions for ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , as discussed previously .",
    "however , apart from the relatively untidy behaviour in some narrow zones , the domains of unique and twofold ( or more ) solutions are relatively well separated over a wide range of the @xmath36 values . moreover , the behaviour of the plots for the particular input values in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] turns out to be quite generic .",
    "the shaded regions again corresponds to a zone where at least one of the output parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) becomes complex - valued . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) we only show on purpose a range of values such that all masses are relatively light , while for larger @xmath36 the dependence of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 upon the latter becomes simpler , almost linear , in accordance with the behaviour in the previous figures for scenario @xmath29 alone .",
    "there are also specific values of the input masses such that one of the solutions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 is becoming very large , due to an explicit pole in the analytic inversion , as reflected e.g. in one of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 solutions , for @xmath106 80 gev and @xmath106 123 gev , respectively . + also , the dependence of scenario @xmath30 upon @xmath0 variations is relatively mild .",
    "in contrast , varying @xmath31 and/or @xmath37 input values can have more drastic effects , since in particular the occurrence of multi - fold solutions depends on those inputs .    finally , for completeness",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the values of the other physical masses @xmath32 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , resulting from the same input choice as in fig .",
    "note that , apart from @xmath65 , the twofold valuedness of @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 $ \\sim$}}~}$]230 gev turns out to be numerically negligible for this particular input . in a more complete and realistic analysis",
    ", it should be possible to examine e.g. whether some of the multi - fold solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] could be excluded by looking at the consistency of the resulting other physical ino masses with data .",
    "ultimately , one would need to reconstruct the remaining part of the soft - breaking lagrangian , i.e. the sfermion and higgs sectors .",
    "in contrast with the ino sector , the de - diagonalization of these sectors would not present much analytical difficulties ( at least at the tree - level ) , provided one knows a sufficient number of physical masses . a full strategy ( including loop effects )",
    "is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our aim here is to simply sketch for completeness some straightforward inversion formulas and make some comments .      in the sfermion sector ,",
    "de - diagonalization is straightforward since it involves @xmath110 mass matrices if neglecting flavor non - diagonal terms .",
    "for instance , from eqs .",
    "( [ mstop ] ) , and assuming the two physical stop masses @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( with the convention @xmath113 ) and the mixing angle @xmath114 to be given as input ( plus @xmath0 ) , one immediately obtains a_t = + ( m^2__2-m^2__1 ) and m^2_q = m^2__1 ^2_+ m^2__2 ^2 _ -m^2_t - ( 2)(4 m^2_w - m^2_z)/6 + m^2_r = m^2__1 ^2_+ m^2__2 ^2 _ -m^2_t + ( 2)(m^2_w - m^2_z ) similar expressions are obtained for the sbottom and stau parameters .",
    "+ evidently , in the case of a more constrained scenario , one would not need all sfermion physical masses and mixing angles to extract the relevant soft terms .",
    "in fact , even in the unconstrained mssm case , @xmath115 is a common parameter to stop and sbottom mass matrices , so that to reconstruct the complete soft terms of this sector one  only \" needs five parameters , to be chosen among the four masses and two mixing angles .",
    "conversely , notice that if knowing the six previous physical input , one can determine @xmath116 very simply from [ tbetasf ] m_w^2 2= m^2__1 ^2_+ m^2__2 ^2 _",
    "-m^2__1 ^2 _ -m^2__2 ^2 _ + m^2_b -m^2_t .      going from physical masses to soft susy  breaking parameters in the higgs sector",
    "also does not involve much difficulties , at least naively .",
    "in fact , electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) gives two ( necessary but not sufficient ) constraints , commonly used to fix the @xmath27 and @xmath1 parameter at the ewsb scale : [ ewsb ] ^2 = - ; + b = ( m^2_h_d + m^2_h_u + 2 ^ 2 ) .",
    "now , one may assume for example that @xmath1 is extracted from the previous ino inversion , and use eqs .",
    "( [ ewsb ] ) , together with the definition of the physical higgs masses , eqs .",
    "( [ hmass ] ) , to determine the basic higgs parameters .",
    "typically , given the lightest cp - even higgs mass @xmath117 , one obtains for the soft parameters at the tree - level : [ mhuhd ] m^2_h_u = ; m^2_h_d = m_a^2-m^2_h_u -2 ^2    [ binv ] b = ( m^2_h_d+m^2_h_u + 2 ^ 2 ) and [ maeq ] m_a^2= and the other physical higgs masses are determined from eqs .",
    "( [ hmass ] ) .",
    "of course as is well known radiative corrections to the higgs masses ( in particular that of the lightest cp - even ) are very important to take into account  @xcite , for some values of the sfermion masses and mixing angles , so that it is much too unrealistic to restrict to such a tree - level higgs parameter inversion . including the leading one - loop corrections in expressions ( [ mhuhd ] - [ maeq ] ) is in fact manageable . in this case",
    "the induced dependence on the full parameter set of the mssm should be in principle taken into account .",
    "in particular , the parameters of the higgs sector we are solving for enter now in a more complicated way equations ( [ ewsb ] ) . however , a very good starting point would be to consider only the dominant top / stop - bottom / sbottom contributions in which case the corrections to eqs.([mhuhd ] - [ maeq ] ) can still be written in an analytical form .",
    "otherwise , one will still have to resort to a thoroughly numerical procedure .",
    "in this paper we have worked out a systematic inversion algorithm and strategy to obtain from relatively simple algebraic relations the basic mssm lagrangian , from some appropriate physical mass inputs .",
    "we mostly concentrated on the ino parameter inversion , which is the less straightforward algebraically , due to a complicated diagonalization structure .",
    "the advantage over possibly more direct methods ( like e.g. some systematic scanning of the lagrangian parameter space ) , is that it gives a fast , reasonably tractable algorithm , and also clearly points out to the existence of non - trivial ambiguities in such a reconstruction , occurring in some definite range of the input mass values  .",
    "+ in addition , our results exhibit the relatively simple and generic behaviour of most of the lagrangian parameters as functions of input masses , apart from some narrow regions where the behaviour is more involved .",
    "if developed further , performing more systematic simulations , this approach may thus potentially give useful insight into the precise connection between the basic mssm parameters and the experimentally measured ones . in the most optimistic case ( that is , if knowing a sufficient number of physical input ino masses and with sufficient accuracy ) it allows for a precise reconstruction of the unconstrained mssm ino sector lagrangian .",
    "in addition , some of the theoretically well - motivated additional assumptions , like for instance the universality of soft mass parameters , should be easily implementable in our basic algorithm , due to its relative flexibility . typically , gaugino mass parameter universality at the gut scale , leading to the approximate relation @xmath118 , can be very simply combined with our iterative algorithm @xmath30 , to give now @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 in terms of only one chargino and one neutralino mass .",
    "+ finally we also mention the complementarity of our approach with the one discussed recently in ref .  @xcite . in particular , our simple analytical determination of @xmath2 , eq . ( [ solm1 ] ) , may be readily implemented as well in their construction .",
    "both procedures are however purely theoretical , in the sense that the influence of experimental errors on the input parameter measurements have not yet been taken into account . in any case , clearly an algebraic approach is a useful tool for a more systematic phenomenological study ( taking into account e.g. the present bounds or the expected future accuracy on input parameters ) to be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
