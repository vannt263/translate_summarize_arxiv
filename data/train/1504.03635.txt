    "atomic , molecular and optical physics with advanced laser technologies has recently emerged as a new platform to study and possibly simulate quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "one of its latest developments is the study of long - range interactions among ultracold particles , in which dipolar quantum gases  @xcite , ion crystals  @xcite , polar molecules  @xcite and rydberg atoms  @xcite allow for revealing the effects of many - body correlations .",
    "rydberg atoms distinguish themselves by their large dipole moments and tunability of the strength and nature of dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "the active electron in a rydberg atom moves in a macroscopic orbital whose size could range from sub - micrometre to several tens of micrometres  @xcite .",
    "the resulting large dipole moments yield a strong interaction @xmath0 of either van der waals or resonant dipolar character between a pair of rydberg atoms separated by @xmath1 .",
    "this interaction , which can be tuned in various ways  @xcite , features the emergence of atomic many - body correlations in an ultracold gas . as a prominent example , these interactions shift the energy levels of atoms encompassing a given rydberg atom , so that additional rydberg excitations are suppressed for @xmath0 larger than the excitation line width .",
    "this effect , referred to as rydberg blockade  @xcite , results in spatial or temporal correlations among the atoms , as recently demonstrated in various settings  @xcite .",
    "its applications include , for example , the realization of universal atomic and photonic logic gates for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade has also turned out to be an outstanding new resource to investigate many - body problems  @xcite .",
    "the blockade condition determines the smallest distance between neighbouring rydberg atoms , which is typically of the order of several micrometres .",
    "however , rydberg excitations can also be induced at smaller interatomic distances by , for example , detuning the excitation - laser frequency from an atomic resonance  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the character of the correlations changes , resulting in the facilitated formation of aggregates consisting of large number of rydberg atoms  @xcite .    a complementary approach to the correlations induced by the interparticle interactions consists in studying the temporal evolution of electronic coherences of the rydberg atoms . using a broadband picosecond laser pulse ,",
    "rydberg excitations can be induced over a wide range of interatomic distances from @xmath2 m to the isolated atom limit .",
    "the number of rydberg excitations per unit volume can thus be larger than the ones in the blockade regime by two orders of magnitude .",
    "although picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses have been previously used to observe electronic wave packets in isolated rydberg atoms  @xcite and the dephasing due to two - body interactions  @xcite , here we exploit them to explore how coherent dynamics evolves in a many - body regime .",
    "the strong interactions in our ultracold rydberg gas induce an electronic dephasing on the picosecond timescale , which is directly observed in a time - domain ramsey interferogram oscillating with a period of @xmath3fs and phase - shifted on the attosecond timescale  @xcite by the rydberg interactions .",
    "we measure this minute phase shift and the dephasing directly , and compare them with theoretical simulations based on nearest - neighbour interactions , a mean - field model and many - body correlations to reveal effects indicating atomic correlations beyond a mean - field description . the two - body interaction energy at around @xmath4 m distance , which can be easily accessed in our approach , exceeds the average kinetic energy by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this regime compares favorably with previous experiments in thermal vapour cell experiments with nanosecond laser pulses  @xcite , where the nearest - neighbour distance is also @xmath2 m . in thermal cells ,",
    "the rydberg interaction energy is comparable to the average kinetic energy , so that the measurement of coherent evolution of the interaction dynamics is strongly affected by the thermal atomic motion , as will be discussed later quantitatively .",
    "figure  [ fig01]a shows the schematics of our experimental setup .",
    "a cold ensemble of @xmath5rb atoms is prepared in an optical dipole trap with temperature and highest peak atom - density estimated to be @xmath670@xmath7 and @xmath61.3@xmath8@xmath9 , respectively ( see methods sections ` estimation of the temperature ' and ` estimation of the atom density ' for these temperature and density estimations ) . on the timescales of interest , atomic motion can be ignored in the frozen gas regime  @xcite .",
    "the atoms are optically pumped to the hyperfine state f=2 , m@xmath10=+2 of the ground state 5s@xmath11 and excited to rydberg states via a two - photon transition using broadband picosecond laser pulses with their centre wavelengths tuned to @xmath12 and @xmath13 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig01]b ) , hereafter referred to as the infrared and blue pulses , respectively .",
    "the dipole - trap laser is turned off @xmath14 before the irradiation of the infrared and blue pulses to avoid 2 + 1 multiphoton ionization induced by a combination of the infrared and blue pulses with the trapping laser light .",
    "the infrared and blue pulses , and the optical pumping beam are circularly polarized in the same direction with respect to the magnetic field , suppressing excitations to the s rydberg states , so that the state @xmath15d@xmath16 , m@xmath17=+5/2 is mostly populated , where @xmath15 is a principal quantum number .",
    "the population of the rydberg state is measured by field ionization  @xcite .",
    "details of the field ionization are described in methods section ` rydberg excitation and detection ' .",
    "the maximum population of the @xmath15d states in the present experiment is not @xmath18 , to suppress photoionization by the picosecond laser pulses ( see supplementary note 1 for the effects of ions ) .",
    "more details on the atom preparation , the estimation of the atom density and the temperature , as well as the rydberg excitation are described in methods and supplementary note 2 .",
    "the bandwidth of our rydberg excitation is determined from a field - ionization spectrum exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig01]c ( see supplementary note 3 ) , in which the excitation is tuned to the @xmath19d@xmath16 state , which is the main target state of the current experiment .",
    "the field - ionization voltage is ramped up slowly enough on the @xmath20s timescale to resolve neighbouring rydberg levels in such field - ionization spectra .",
    "the bandwidth of the excitation is @xmath21ghz ( full width at half maximum , fwhm ) and is much larger than those of the continuous - wave , nanosecond , and sub - nanosecond pulsed lasers employed in previous ultracold rydberg experiments  @xcite .",
    "the field - ionization spectrum indicates that the bandwidth of the rydberg excitation is larger than the energy separation of neighbouring rydberg states and is accordingly wide enough to remove the rydberg blockade . as schematically shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01]d , our picosecond laser pulses can excite a pair of rb atoms simultaneously to the rydberg states @xmath22 even at interatomic distances",
    "shorter than @xmath4 m .",
    "the interaction among the rydberg atoms is observed by time - domain ramsey interferometry with a pair of the rydberg excitations , hereafter referred to as the ` pump ' and ` probe ' excitations , whose delay was stabilized on the attosecond timescale with our homemade optical interferometer  @xcite ( see methods section ` time - domain ramsey interferometry ' ) . by scanning the delay time @xmath23 between the pump and probe excitations on the attosecond timescale",
    ", we measure the ramsey oscillation of the population integrated over all rydberg states , which remains after the probe excitation , by the field ionization .",
    "the field - ionization voltage in these ramsey measurements is ramped up rapidly enough on the @xmath24ns timescale to avoid subsequent decay processes of the rydberg states . for the excitation tuned to the @xmath19d@xmath16 state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01]c , a single rydberg state @xmath25 with @xmath22 is predominantly populated .",
    "the rydberg population thus measured oscillates as a function of @xmath23 with a frequency close to the transition frequency between the 5s and rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard ramsey interferometry , in which the signal oscillates with a frequency close to the detuning frequency of the excitation laser from the atomic transition  @xcite .",
    "that is , in the absence of interactions , the population in the rydberg state @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 and oscillates with the frequency @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the energy of the rydberg state @xmath25 measured from the ground state 5s ( see refs 42 , 49 and supplementary note 2 ) , and @xmath30 is the planck constant @xmath31 divided by @xmath32 .",
    "this oscillation is identical to the temporal oscillation of the rydberg state @xmath25 , except that the real - time @xmath33 is replaced by the pump - probe delay @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the ramsey oscillation for @xmath22 corresponds essentially to the temporal oscillation of the rydberg wave function @xmath34 and to the recurrence motion of an electronic wave packet , which is composed of the @xmath35s and rydberg state @xmath22 superposed coherently by the excitation pulses .",
    "here we investigate how the rydberg interactions affect this coherent electron dynamics .    in a simplified mean - field approach ,",
    "the rydberg interactions change only the energy of the rydberg state @xmath25 and accordingly the oscillation period of @xmath26 .",
    "this results in a phase - shift of the ramsey oscillation accumulated in the delay time @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , as the atoms are randomly distributed in the ensemble , their energy levels @xmath29 are shifted randomly by the interactions , making the periods of their ramsey oscillations different from each other .",
    "therefore , the measured signal is the superposition of many oscillations with different periods , so that its contrast is expected to decay as a function of @xmath23 due to rydberg interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig02]a - c show examples of the ramsey oscillations for the @xmath19d@xmath16 state with a population of @xmath36 . as mentioned above",
    ", these oscillations correspond to the ultrafast recurrence motion of the electronic wave packet with a period of @xmath3fs . for each oscillation , we measured the field - ionization signals of two atomic ensembles with different peak densities estimated to be @xmath37 and @xmath38@xmath9 alternately to suppress systematic uncertainties , scanning @xmath23 in steps of @xmath39as ( see methods section ` estimation of the atom density ' for these density estimations ) .",
    "we obtained the contrasts and phases of the measured oscillations by sinusoidal fitting , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02]a - c ( see methods section ` time - domain ramsey interferometry ' ) . figure  [ fig02]d shows that the contrast is approximately constant for @xmath23 up to @xmath40ps for the lower - density ensemble ( blue - circle data points ) , indicating that the effects of the interactions are negligibly small .",
    "this result is consistent with the interaction strength estimated from the present atom density and the two - atom potential curve presented in supplementary fig .  1 .",
    "hereafter , we take these contrasts and phases measured in the lower - density ensemble as references to be compared with those measured in the higher - density ensemble .",
    "the oscillatory structures on the @xmath41ps timescale at @xmath42ps seen in fig .",
    "2d could be partly due to the recurrence motion of a wave - packet composed of the rydberg state @xmath22 and the traces of its neighbouring states seen in fig .",
    "1c ( see supplementary note 4 for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig02]d shows that the contrast decays as a function of @xmath23 for the higher - density ensemble ( red - circle data points ) .",
    "the phase shift of the higher - density ensemble from the lower - density one also changes as a function of @xmath23 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig02]e .",
    "the offset of this phase shift at @xmath43 is essentially due to the difference between ac - stark shifts of the atomic levels in the higher- and lower - density ensembles .",
    "slight differences between the sizes , shapes and positions of the higher- and lower - density ensembles could lead to their different ac - stark shifts ( see supplementary note 2 for more details on the origin of this zero - delay offset of the phase shift ) .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] shows the results of measurements of the contrast ratio between the two different densities given above , hereafter referred to as ` ramsey contrast ' , and the phase shift for the 42d@xmath16 state .",
    "these results are plotted as functions of @xmath23 for the two different rydberg populations @xmath44 of 1.2@xmath450.1@xmath46 and 3.3@xmath450.1@xmath46 , showing that the ramsey contrast decays , and the phase shift is accumulated as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] that the contrast decay and the phase shift are enhanced when the rydberg population is increased from @xmath61.2@xmath46 to @xmath63.3@xmath46 . the strength of the interactions is tuned by varying the rydberg quantum number @xmath15 and the atom density . figure  [ fig04]a shows ramsey contrasts as functions of @xmath23 for three different rydberg levels @xmath47 , 42 and 50 .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the contrast decay is accelerated by increasing the principal quantum number @xmath15 of the rydberg level .",
    "the dependence of the ramsey contrast decay on the atom density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04]b , in which the contrast decay is accelerated by increasing the atom density ( see supplementary note 5 for the estimation of the atom densities plotted in the abscissa of this figure ) . from these combined measurements as functions of the rydberg population , principal quantum number and atom density , we conclude that the observed contrast decay and the phase shift are induced by rydberg interactions .    the origin of the observed behaviour of the contrast decay and the phase shift is further investigated in fig .  [ fig03 ] .",
    "here we compare the experimental data with the ramsey contrast decays and the phase shifts calculated for nearest - neighbour interactions without considering interactions among three or more rydberg atoms ( solid lines ) .",
    "the zero - delay offset of the calculated phase shift is arbitrary and adjusted so that the average of the first ten data points is equal to the calculated phase shift averaged over the delay window for those ten data points .",
    "results for nearest - neighbour interactions are obtained by simple numerical calculations following those performed in previous ramsey studies @xcite , in which the time - domain ramsey oscillations modulated by nearest - neighbour interactions are averaged over the distribution of nearest - neighbour distances ( see supplementary note 6 for details ) . here",
    ", the ramsey oscillation is obtained by solving a schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian for two interacting atoms .",
    "we assume a van der waals interaction of the form @xmath48 with the coefficient @xmath49 being an adjusting parameter .",
    "it is seen in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig03]a , b that the calculated ramsey contrast decay becomes slightly faster as the @xmath49 value is increased , but does not grow beyond the decay thresholds 0.988 and 0.967 determined by the rydberg population @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ( for details on these thresholds , see supplementary note 6 ) .",
    "similary , the calculated phase shift is almost constant as the @xmath49 value is increased , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03]c , d .",
    "these features are not altered by changing the character of the interaction such as van der waals and dipole - dipole  ( see supplementary note 6 for details ) .",
    "the contrast decays and phase shifts observed experimentally are thus clearly larger than expected for nearest - neighbour interactions . it is therefore concluded that our experimental observation of the ramsey contrast decay and phase shift on the attosecond timescale demonstrates interactions among more than two rydberg atoms , and the effect of those interactions on the electron dynamics can be actively controlled by tuning the population and principal quantum number of the rydberg level , as well as the atom density .          to model these observations ,",
    "we first apply a mean - field model ( see supplementary note 7 for its details ) . as in the calculations with nearest - neighbour interactions above , we assume a van der waals interaction of the form @xmath48 with the coefficient @xmath49 being the only fitting parameter , which is optimized to reproduce the measured ramsey contrast in fig .",

    "this discrepancy between measured and simulated phase shifts is not improved by assuming a dipole - dipole interaction , a hybrid form of a dipole - dipole and a van der waals interaction or by introducing anisotropic interactions ( see supplementary figs  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the closer agreement between the measured and simulated phase shifts for @xmath56 in fig .",
    "3d than for @xmath50 in fig .",
    "3c is understood as follows .",
    "the gaussian atom - density distribution of our experimental setup leads to the saturation of the phase shift at longer pump - probe delays .",
    "this is because the rapid decrease of the atom density in the gaussian tails results in the suppression of the contribution to the phase shift from atoms distant from the centre , and therefore the phase shift does not grow afterwards .",
    "this saturation is reached both by the measured and simulated phase shifts for @xmath56 within our measurement time @xmath57ps ( unlike the case with @xmath50 and therefore weaker interactions ) , giving their closer agreement for @xmath56 than for @xmath50 .",
    "this saturation effect is explained more quantitatively in supplementary note 9 .",
    "next , we apply an exactly solvable theory model  @xcite to the observations . details of this model are presented in ref .",
    "briefly , we represent each atom as a two - level system , which is a pseudo - spin system , consisting of a ground state @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and an excited rydberg state @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) with energies @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the experiment consists of four stages : ( i ) the pump excitation , ( ii ) an evolution with an @xmath64-atom hamiltonian @xmath65 , ( iii ) the probe excitation and ( iv ) the population measurement by field ionization .",
    "the @xmath64-atom hamiltonian in stage ( ii ) includes the atomic energies and the interactions @xmath66 between atoms in the rydberg states as follows : @xmath67 with @xmath68 the atomic - resonance frequency and @xmath69 the pauli matrix , which is used to represent the internal states of the pseudo - spin at position @xmath70 ( see methods section ` outline of the exactly solvable model simulation ' for more details )  @xcite .",
    "an exact solution for the time evolution with a hamiltonian of the form of equation  ( [ eq : the1 ] ) has recently been presented in refs 5054 ( see also similar numerical approaches in refs 55,56 ) .",
    "this allows for deriving an expression for the exact time evolution of the ramsey signal @xmath71 for any strength of interactions  @xcite . for any given atom @xmath70 interacting with @xmath72 neighbouring rydberg atoms ,",
    "one obtaines @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath44 are the ground- and rydberg - state populations , respectively , produced by the initial pump excitation , @xmath75 describes a frequency shift induced by the interaction between atoms @xmath70 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the phase offset arising from the ac - stark shifts during the picosecond pulse excitations ( see supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "it is seen from this equation that this model considers different clusters of interactions superposed coherently instead of averaged as performed in our preceding mean - field analysis .",
    "this coherent superposition leads to correlations among different atoms , as exemplified for a two - atom correlation in fig .",

    "experiments similar to the ones demonstrated here could in principle be implemented in thermal cells  @xcite if one can compensate for the relevant doppler shift , which causes a phase shift comparable to the interaction - induced phase shift , and can also compensate the effects of atomic motions . in the thermal cell at a room temperature , the atoms are not frozen , but move with kinetic energies at that temperature , so that the motion would lead to additional phase shifts on the order of @xmath132 under the conditions ( @xmath133 nm , @xmath134ps , @xmath135  m / s ) , where @xmath136 is the wavelength that corresponds to the energy difference between the ground and rydberg states . in our current ultracold measurements , on the other hand , the atoms move only @xmath103pm on average during the same duration , and this distance is shorter than @xmath136 by four orders of magnitude .",
    "this distance is also shorter than the average nearest - neighbour distance in our rydberg gas by four orders of magnitude ( see methods section ` estimation of the atom density ' ) .",
    "our rydberg gas is therefore safely regarded as a frozen gas , so that the effects of the atomic motions and collisions on the measurements of coherent dynamics are negligible .    in our present study , a combination of the contrast and phase measurements serves as a useful tool to observe the effects of many - body correlations .",
    "the correlations would be further verified by additional measurements of variance in ramsey signals , as is performed in refs 8,57 , to observe similar many - body correlation effects .",
    "combining a microscope  @xcite with our experimental setup offers another future possibility to observe many - body correlations more directly in a spatially resolved manner .    we anticipate promising future applications of applying ultrashort coherent laser pulses to ultracold rydberg gases . using alternative excitation schemes",
    ", one may investigate beyond mean - field effects in ramsey experiments with more complex hamiltonians such as heisenberg - type hamiltonians of interest for polar molecules  @xcite and atomic clocks  @xcite in optical lattices .",
    "another application could be the investigation of a scenario in which rydberg electronic wave functions are spatially overlapped between neighbouring rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "this could lead to new exotic phases in which the rydberg electrons are shared among many nuclei , and exchange interactions play key roles in their dynamical properties on the ultrafast timescales .",
    "such a metal - like many - body rydberg state would naturally lead to penning ionization quite rapidly .",

    "the total number of atoms was also slightly underestimated by the _ in - situ _ absorption imaging in the ramsey measurements because of the spatial resolution , so that it was calibrated in a later independent experiment in which the loading sequence and the trap laser focusing ( the trapping conditions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ) were almost the same as those employed in the ramsey measurements . in this calibration experiment , we measured the total number of atoms by the absorption imaging with the expansion of the atomic ensemble as a function of the one measured without the expansion to obtain a linear calibration curve with its slope being @xmath172 .",

    "this excitation scheme also suppressed the raman transition between the f=2 and f=1 hyperfine states in the ground state that could happen within the single infrared pulse to induce undesirable beating in the ramsey contrast as a function of @xmath23 , of which an example is shown in fig .",

    "the obtained ramsey interferogram was fitted with a sinusoidal function . as the expected energy shift induced by the interaction was at most on the order of @xmath208ghz , much smaller than the eigenfrequency of the rydberg state itself ( @xmath209hz ) , we fitted the interferograms with the same eigenfrequencies for the higher and lower densities to evaluate the phase shift of the higher - density ensemble from the lower - density one .",
