    "diagrammatic proof of the renormalizability of qed in the bphz context is a lengthy derivation @xcite . in 1984 , polchinski presented a simple proof using a version of wilsonian renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the @xmath1 theory @xcite .",
    "although polchinski s proof of renormalizability could in principle be extended to qed , the manifest violation of gauge invariance in his momentum cutoff formulation was an obstacle to a straightforward proof .",
    "this has been extensively studied and is by now a well understood derivation of renormalizability of qed @xcite ( for recent reviews see @xcite and the literature therein ) . yet",
    ", it remains an untidy procedure involving either complicated cutoff insertions or additional labor for the proof of ward identities .    in this work",
    ", we present a simple extension of polchinski s proof of renormalizability to qed using a hidden generalized gauge invariance of the cutoff formulation , thus circumventing the need for explicit verification of the ward identities . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our slightly modified cutoff procedure of polchinski and apply it to the @xmath1 theory . the cutoff procedure we use is simply multiplying the fields by an appropriate cutoff function in the momentum representation , as explained in sec .",
    "ii . the new point - wise product in the momentum space , defines a `` deformed '' nonlocal product in the coordinate space . for the reasons which will be explained below , and are originally indicated in @xcite , the cutoff function is to be taken as a sequence of analytic functions which converge to a sharp cutoff .",
    "this procedure has its origin in kogut and wilson s @xcite `` incomplete integration '' , with which wilson s exact rge was first formulated .",
    "wetterich introduced a similar concept of `` average field '' in the discussion of rge @xcite , which was a precursor to his well - known presentation of exact average rge @xcite .",
    "we , however , arrived at this cutoff procedure from an entirely different angle of translationally invariant noncommutative gauge theory @xcite , which led us to the symmetry of the cutoff effective action for gauge theories , explained in sec .",
    "iii . here ,",
    "using the new deformed product of functions , we present the generalized ( deformed ) cutoff gauge symmetry of the cutoff qed , and indicate its renormalizability .",
    "based on the idea proposed in the present paper , lizzi and vitale show recently in @xcite that the new `` deformed '' gauge symmetry , defined by a `` deformed '' product of fields , leads to a new cocommutative hopf algebra with `` deformed '' costructures .",
    "they argue that in order to preserve the associativity of the new deformed product of functions , the above mentioned cutoff function is to be analytic .",
    "being analytic , however , the new product can be interpreted as a simple redefinition of fields , which is isomorphic to a point - wise product and therefore physically trivial . to circumvent this problem",
    ", they propose the cutoff function to be a sequence of analytic functions , which converge to a sharp cutoff , as indicated above .",
    "moreover , using a rigorous mathematical construction of the new deformed hopf algebra , they explicitly show that the map between this deformed hopf algebra and the standard ( undeformed ) one , which is to be compatible with the suggested field redefinition , does not satisfy the coalgebra and the hopf algebra homomorphisms .",
    "thus , the new deformed gauge symmetry is inequivalent to the standard one and defines a bona fide new symmetry . in order to show that the proposed cutoff qed is renormalizable without destroying the ( deformed ) cutoff gauge invariance , the ward - takahashi s identities of the cutoff theory are to be verified",
    "this will be done in sect .",
    "a derivation of the deformed ward - takahashi s identities will be presented in appendix a , for the sake of completeness .",
    "as it turns out , the new deformed symmetry is preserved along the renormalization group flow , for every fixed ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff .",
    "this was indeed expected , because as it is pointed out in @xcite , although the sharp cutoff can not define a deformed associative product , but the theory with a sharp cutoff , being a limit of a hopf gauge invariant theory , exhibits the same symmetries of the theory defined with the deformed product of fields .",
    "let us notice that the cutoff procedure we use and the consequent symmetry can be easily generalized to the gauge theory with any group and matter field , including @xmath2 , as the noncommutative structure from which it is derived in sec .",
    "iii can be extended trivially to these cases .",
    "the point being that the `` noncommutative geometric '' structure we will be using , is in fact abelian .",
    "for simplicity of presentation , we will restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath3 gauge group , qed . in @xcite , the case of @xmath2 gauge group",
    "is studied .    in sec .",
    "iv , we will use the idea of field deformation and the method developed in @xcite to derive the corresponding exact rg flow equation for the effective average action of @xmath0 theory including an appropriate infrared ( ir ) cutoff function ( see also appendix b for a detailed proof ) .",
    "we will show that the deformed flow equation is different from the usual rg exact flow equation derived in @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this difference is the multiplicative nature of our cutoff function , in contrast to the additive ir cutoff introduced in @xcite . modifying each field with such a multiplicative cutoff ,",
    "the cutoff function appears not only in the kinetic term , but also in the interacting part of the classical cut off action .",
    "it is interesting to generalize this procedure to gauge theories and to explore the possible practical consequences of the new exact average rg for the effective average action as well as the hidden generalized gauge symmetry along the flow , pointed out in this paper .",
    "the origin of this gauge symmetry will nevertheless be discussed in the conclusions , sec .",
    "in this section we redo polchinski s proof of @xmath1 theory @xcite by a slightly different cutoff procedure . the real scalar theory defined by the action @xmath4,\\ ] ] and the momentum cutoff @xmath5 in the euclidean space",
    "is regularized by polchinski via introduction of a momentum cutoff @xmath6 into the propagator , @xmath7 the main property of the function @xmath6 is that it has a value equal to @xmath8 for @xmath9 and decreases rapidly for @xmath10 .",
    "an example is @xmath11,&\\qquad&\\frac{\\lambda_0 ^ 2}{4}<p^{2}<\\lambda_0 ^ 2,\\\\ 0,&\\qquad&p^{2}\\geq \\lambda_0 ^ 2 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cutoff function @xmath6 effectively cuts off the momentum integral in all loops , rendering them ultraviolet finite in perturbation theory .",
    "the introduction of a cutoff function in the propagators , and consequently in all loops is an efficient procedure of implementing wilson s renormalization group flow , as the cutoff momentum @xmath12 can now be lowered all the way down to zero in the path integral for the effective action .",
    "the remarkable aspect of the introduction of the cutoff function in the loop integrals is that loop integrals can now be estimated easily and cutoff independence of green s functions be demonstrated in a few steps in marked contrast to the lengthy bphz proof of renormalizability .    in this work ,",
    "we propose to modify this procedure by extending the cutoff to all the terms in the action , and in fact to all fields . in our formulation",
    "we replace the field @xmath13 by their cutoff counterpart @xmath14 in momentum space . comparing to ( [ g1 ] )",
    ", @xmath15 is to be identified with @xmath16 .",
    "this is therefore a straightforward implementation of wilson s cutoff procedure executed directly on the fields rather than on the path integrals .    in the original polchinski s formulation , cutoff independence of the theory",
    "is @xmath17 and , the running effective action is @xmath18.\\ ] ] equation ( [ g6 ] ) then determines the running effective interaction lagrangian @xmath19 at the @xmath20 scale , which now satisfies the functional differential equation @xmath21.\\ ] ] our formulation does not yet differ from polchinski s as the functional @xmath19 is not yet specified .",
    "the difference shows up when expanding @xmath19 in a series in @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 in polchinski s formulation the renormalization flow equation ( [ g8 ] ) reduces to a set of equations for the coefficient functions @xmath24 , whose solution would give the effective action at scale @xmath20 , @xmath25 here , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 a convenient rescaling @xmath28 has been inserted in ( [ g10 ] ) .    in our formulation",
    ", however , the expansion in ( [ g9 ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath29 as every momentum space field @xmath13 is rescaled and cut off by the cutoff function @xmath30 from ( [ g4 ] ) .",
    "it may seem that the subsequent steps in renormalizality may get complicated , but this is not the case .",
    "in fact the resulting renormalization group flow equations for the function @xmath31 , now would be exactly the same form as ( [ g10 ] ) for the coefficient functions , where the function @xmath32 of polchinski has to be replaced by @xmath33 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the advantage of polchinski s approach to renormalization is that the insertion of a cutoff function in the integrals allows him to estimate the coefficient functions @xmath34 through functional analytic methods and put bounds on them ; and then to prove cutoff independence of the green s functions in perturbation theory , through a series of lemmas .",
    "note that in all this the function @xmath15 appears , as in ( [ g8 ] ) , only in its derivative form @xmath35 , which does not affect the estimate arguments which involve various norms of functions .",
    "we will not go through the entire analysis , but only point out the validity of the procedure in our approach in cases where there is ground for doubt .",
    "the first instance that our approach may invalidate polchinski s result is when a bound on @xmath36 is obtained through ( [ g10 ] ) using the bounds @xmath37 and @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are appropriate constants .",
    "the result @xmath41 and similar bounds are central to the proof of renormalizability . in ( [ g15 ] ) , @xmath42 is the rth term in the perturbative expansion of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are polynomials of order @xmath45 .",
    "in our case , ( [ g10 ] ) involves @xmath46 rather than @xmath43 .",
    "one must make sure that the appearance of the @xmath47 s does not ruin the bounds in polchinski and therefore ruin the arguments on renormalizability of the theory .",
    "we have identified the function @xmath15 of ( [ g2 ] ) with @xmath16 of ( [ g4 ] ) , as mentioned above .",
    "therefore if @xmath15 s should behave as in polchinski s formulation , i.e. go to zero when @xmath48 approaches @xmath49 , and vanish for @xmath50 , then @xmath47 should become large as @xmath48 approaches @xmath49 .",
    "of course , we set @xmath51 for @xmath50 .",
    "therefore in the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) of ( [ g10 ] ) , after inserting @xmath52 for @xmath43 s , as the @xmath47 s are larger than one in their range of definition , they can be dropped in the ensuing inequality .",
    "on the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ g10 ] ) , we now use the functional norm with an appropriate weight to kill off the value of @xmath53 for @xmath54 , leading to the desired inequality ( [ g15 ] ) , this time for @xmath55 s .",
    "let us note that the above choice for @xmath15 , is not a unique one .",
    "it is easy to show , that polchinski s proof is also correct for @xmath15 becoming large as @xmath48 approaches @xmath49 . in the next section",
    ", we will use this second alternative , and define , as in @xcite , the cutoff function @xmath56 as a sequence of analytic functions satisfying @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is a sharp ( uv ) cutoff . on @xmath59 will be omitted in the rest of this paper . ]",
    "this property is necessary to avoid the interpretation of the deformation ( [ g4 ] ) to be just a redefinition of fields in the momentum space @xcite ( for more mathematical details , see the discussions at the end of the next section ) .",
    "the polchinski s procedure was applied to qed very early and provided a simple proof of renormalizability of the theory @xcite . in qed",
    "there are now two propagators to cut off , that of the electron and that of the photon .",
    "this can be done with the same cutoff function .",
    "the renormalization group equation is similarly derived and estimates for the coefficient functions and bounds on green s functions obtained .",
    "the situation is then a straightforward extension of the @xmath1 theory .",
    "there is only one significant hurdle to overcome which has engaged authors of refs .",
    "@xcite ever since and is the subject of the present work , _",
    "i.e. _ the question of gauge invariance .",
    "the problem is that polchinski s approach , and in fact any approach involving a momentum cutoff , inherently violates gauge invariance : gauge invariance is a statement about the behavior of gauge fields in a space - time point , involving all momenta .",
    "thus , at any finite cutoff scale @xmath20 , the flow equation and its solutions are not gauge invariant .",
    "however , it was proved , that the final ir point of the flow @xmath60 , the expressions for the quantum effective action and the green s functions are indeed invariant @xcite .",
    "there were also nontrivial modifications of the cutoff procedure which were not gauge invariant all along the flow , but only at its end points .",
    "these formulations have been extensively pursued in the application of the exact renormalization group in such areas as qcd ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , and gravity @xcite",
    ". in all these works derivation of the modified ward - takahashi identities is the essential complication .    in this section",
    ", we will show that our version of introduction of the momentum cutoff in the theory ensures persistence of gauge invariance in the form of a generalized deformed symmetry of the cutoff qed and derive the resultant deformed ward - takahashi identities in a standard manner .",
    "we start from the classical action of qed , @xmath61 with the cutoff function @xmath30 inserted on each field in the momentum space @xmath62 we arrive at the deformed cutoff ( effective ) action @xmath63\\tilde{a}^{\\mu}(k)\\tilde{a}^{\\nu}(-k)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int \\frac{d^{4}p}{(2\\pi)^{4}}~h_{\\lambda}^{2}(p)\\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(p)\\left(\\gamma_{\\mu}p^{\\mu}-m\\right)\\tilde{\\psi}(-p)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -e\\int \\frac{d^{4}p}{(2\\pi)^{4}}\\frac{d^{4}q}{(2\\pi)^{4}}\\frac{d^{4}\\ell}{(2\\pi)^{4}}~h_{\\lambda}(p)h_{\\lambda}(\\ell)h_{\\lambda}(q)\\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(p)\\gamma^{\\mu } \\tilde{a}_{\\mu}(\\ell)\\tilde{\\psi}(q)\\delta^{4}(\\ell+q - p).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the cutoff function @xmath30 is to be analytic and has to converge to a sharp ( uv ) cutoff function , as is expressed in .",

    "first , let us notice that in the cutoff @xmath0 theory , the relations between the @xmath175-point green s functions @xmath176 and @xmath175-point vertex functions @xmath177 are not directly affected by the cutoff function @xmath155 [ for a proof , see app .",
    "this is in contrast to , e.g. ( [ s4a ] ) , where the ordinary relation between two - point green s function and 1pi two - point vertex function is modified with an additional term including the cutoff function @xmath131 . as it turns out , this is because of the multiplicative nature of @xmath155 , in contrast to the additive nature of @xmath178 from ( [ s1 ] ) , consisting of the ir cutoff function @xmath131 .",
    "the second point concerns the appearance of new additional contributions in ( [ s8 ] ) compared to ( [ s4 ] ) .",
    "this is because in the cutoff @xmath0 theory , @xmath155 appears not only in the kinetic part of the classical cut off action , as in the standard derivation of ( [ s4 ] ) , but also in interaction part of the classical action , as all the new contributions are proportional to @xmath179 , with @xmath165 from ( [ s7 ] ) , appearing in the interaction part of @xmath180 from ( [ s6 ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the practical consequences of these new terms in rg flow equation ( [ s8 ] ) .",
    "this will be done elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us also note that the procedure leading to ( [ s8 ] ) can be easily generalized to abelian and non - abelian gauge theories . as we have shown in the previous section , a new hidden gauge symmetry associated with the cutoff procedure used in this paper exists , which guarantees the gauge invariance along the flow equation .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation of the standard wetterich s exact rge , where the manifest gauge invariance is lost , because the regulator is not manifestly gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "theory ( [ s8 ] ) .",
    "the thick black line represents full two - point green s functions @xmath181^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the filled red boxes and the small red circles represent the insertion of a factor @xmath182 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "the thin lines connected to @xmath183 denote the background field @xmath184 .",
    "the big gray and black circles are 1pi three- as well as four - point vertex functions , @xmath185 as well as @xmath186 , respectively . , width=623,height=207 ]",
    "in the first part of this work we presented the procedure of introducing a momentum cutoff in a field theory by directly cutting off the momentum on each field via a sequence of analytic uv cutoff functions , @xmath56 , that converge appropriately to a sharp uv cutoff @xmath58 from ( [ g16 ] ) .",
    "for qed the resulting exact renormalization group flow equation was shown to respect a generalized `` cutoff gauge invariance '' which ensures renormalizability , and unitarity without the need for an explicit calculation using modified ward - takahashi identities .    we need to emphasize that although the gauge symmetry found is motivated from a noncommutative geometric setup , this symmetry is an inherent symmetry of ordinary qed cut off in momentum , in the spirit of polchinski s procedure .",
    "our cutoff procedure may also be applied to non - abelian gauge theories in a similar manner and the resultant exact renormalization group flow be used for calculation of various nonperturbative quantities in qcd @xcite and in gravity @xcite .",
    "there is a subtle point that we would like to emphasize in conclusion and that is the singular nature of our cutoff function @xmath56 .",
    "as stated earlier , this function is quite general , subject only to the restriction that it be equal to unity for momenta smaller than @xmath20 and vanishing rapidly above it . strictly speaking the cutoff function",
    "@xmath56 is to be chosen as a sequence of analytic functions , that converge to sharp uv cutoff function @xmath58 , defined in ( [ g16 ] ) .",
    "this is also recently indicated in @xcite .",
    "let us notice again that @xmath56 is to be smooth , as a sharp cutoff function violates the associativity of our translationally invariant star - algebra .",
    "moreover , the symmetries and the correct ward - takahashi s identities for each fixed @xmath20 are only guaranteed when @xmath47 satisfies ( [ g16 ] ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is also shown that the new deformed symmetry , proposed in the present paper , results in a new hopf algebra , which is mathematically inequivalent with the undeformed one .",
    "this guarantees that the new ( deformed ) cutoff gauge invariance is a new genuine symmetry .",
    "this also resolves the puzzle that multiplication of the fields by a function @xmath47 , if it were smooth , would simply be a field redefinition of the theory and therefore physically trivial .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we used an analytic ir cutoff function , @xmath155 , that converges , as its uv counterpart , to a sharp ir cutoff function , @xmath161 defined in ( [ s6 - 0 ] ) . for this scale dependent cutoff function , @xmath187 , the rg flow of the effective average action is derived and is shown to be different from the standard flow equation from @xcite . in @xcite , we will generalize the method leading to the exact rg equation of cutoff @xmath0 theory to gauge theories and will explore the practical consequences of the new generalized gauge symmetry together with the effect of new terms appearing in the rg flow equation ( [ s8 ] ) of the effective average action corresponding to these cutoff gauge theories .",
