    "a proper understanding of non - perturbative phenomena in field theory and statistical mechanics is a major challenge in theoretical physics . among the most important examples of such phenomena it counts the problem of color confinement in qcd , which , despite tireless attempts along the years , is still begging for a theoretical description .",
    "another renowned unsolved problem is that of the ising model in three dimensions . actually , both problems are known to be connected , as the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture @xcite states that the three - dimensional ising model is closely related to the problem of color confinement and that it likely captures its main non - perturbative features near the transition .",
    "more generally , three - dimensional ising model is closely related to a large class of physical systems near the critical point .",
    "consequently , a deeper understanding of the non - perturbative dynamics of the three - dimensional ising model would be of great importance in several areas of theoretical physics @xcite . in turn , trying to find new semi - analytical methods , non - perturbative in nature , to shed new light on this problem represents a very interesting program .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "it has been proposed to address the problem of three - dimensional ising model by using a method originally inspired in the spirit of regge s theory of scattering @xcite .",
    "regge theory is a fully non - perturbative approach which allows the description of many experimental data in terms of an ansatz with few parameters , these to be determined in comparison with observations and/or by using theoretical arguments .",
    "the idea in @xcite was to propose an ansatz , also with few parameters , to describe the free energy of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "the ansatz is heuristically motivated by mimicking the relation existing between the expression for the free energy in one and two dimensions .",
    "then , tuning the parameters of the model for it to describe the high temperature regime , one ends up with an expression that also reproduces the results at low temperature with remarkable accuracy .",
    "this idea was first discussed in @xcite and it was partially confirmed by the results of @xcite , where , even in its most simplified formulation ( in which a _ minimal duality breaking _ was assumed ) , such a method was shown to give results in a surprising agreement with observations and monte carlo data . in order to investigate the model in more detail ( and with modest computational resources ) it is necessary to find a theoretical tool able to fix ( or at least to find some bounds on ) the _ regge parameters _ appearing in the model of @xcite .",
    "here , we report a remarkable progress in this direction .    a suitable tool to theoretically constraint the ansatz of @xcite is the analysis of the fisher zeros , which is a powerful technique developed by m. fisher in the 1960 s .",
    "following the ideas of yang and lee @xcite , fisher suggested to think of the inverse temperature @xmath5 as a complex variable @xcite .",
    "this technique permits to get relevant physical information about the statistical system by looking at the analytic properties of the ( extended ) thermodynamical functions .",
    "for instance , the distribution of zeros of the partition function in the complex @xmath5 plane ( fisher zeros ) near the critical point permits to determine the universal amplitude ratio @xmath6 of the specific heat ; see the classical papers @xcite .",
    "it has been also stressed that fisher zeros technique turns out to be useful in analyzing the strength of the phase transitions ( see for instance @xcite  @xcite  and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned with the analysis of fisher zeros within the framework of @xcite . as it will be explained in more details in the next sections ,",
    "the ansatz proposed in @xcite appears to be well suited for this kind of analysis since it is , in a sense , already in a _ fisher zeros form_. this method suggests a simple way to realize a _",
    "strong breaking of duality _ , leading to an improvement of the semi - analytical results in comparison with the numerical data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1 , a short introduction to fisher zeros",
    "is given . in section 2 , the relations between fisher zeros and duality breaking in ising model is discussed . in section 3 , the nice interplay between fisher zeros and the kallen - lehmann representation ( kl ) is analyzed in detail . in section 4",
    ", we introduce what we call the _ strong duality breaking _ in the kl free energy for the three - dimensional ising model . in section 5",
    ", it is shown how the strong duality breaking improves the comparison with monte carlo results , both at high and at low temperatures . in section 6 ,",
    "the behavior of the critical exponent at the critical point is described , together with the behavior of the universal amplitude ratio of the specific heat @xmath7 . besides",
    ", some feasible further improvements are pointed out .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section 7 .",
    "as it has been argued originally by m. fisher @xcite , a very powerful method to analyze the thermodynamics of a generic spin system is to complexify its temperature and to study the distribution of zeros of the partition function in the complex @xmath5 plane .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the partition function and the free energy of the system under analysis , respectively , and let @xmath10 be the distribution of zeros of @xmath8 in the complex @xmath5-plane , such that @xmath11 is the number of zeros of @xmath8 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where near the critical point @xmath14 one has @xmath15 ( the meaning of the parameter @xmath16 is clarified below ) .",
    "then , one can show that , near the critical point @xmath17 , the non - analytic part of the internal energy ( that is , the singular part of the derivative of the free energy ) and of the free energy itself , responsible for the phase transition , have the following form @xmath18where `` @xmath19 '' means the complex conjugate and @xmath20 is a suitable cut - off . the angle @xmath16 is the angle formed by the tangent to the curve of zeros of @xmath8 and the real axis at the critical point @xmath21 . from the formulas above , one can derive an expression for the singular part of the specific heat @xmath22    then , let us consider a system undergoing a second order phase transition , so that the singular part of the specific heat reads@xmath23where @xmath0 is the critical exponent and , in general , @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ratio @xmath25 is a universal quantity , so that its computation is a relevant ( and challenging ) question .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 can be measured in many interesting physical systems .",
    "it can be shown ( see , for instance , @xcite @xcite ) that both @xmath10 near the critical point and the value of @xmath7 are related to @xmath16 in such a way that , for @xmath27 , the relations read @xmath28}{\\cos [ ( 2-\\alpha ) \\phi + \\alpha \\pi ] } , \\ \\ \\ \\",

    "@xcite @xmath29 , but it is not the case in three dimensions , where it is known that @xmath31 ( see , for an updated review , @xcite . )    the aim of the present paper is to discuss the relation between the existence of a cusp in the fisher curve ( i.e. the fact that @xmath32 ) and a breaking of the 2d ising self - duality .",
    "such a duality symmetry is absent in the 3d ising model ; consequently , any suitable attempt to dimensionally extend analytic methods from two to three dimensions would require to specify a precise mechanism of self - duality breaking .",
    "in @xcite self - duality was broken in the softest possible way . here",
    "we will show that a stronger breaking is favoured by the comparison with observations .",

    "@xmath36 a smooth function , it is also true that @xmath37 the function @xmath36 ( a sort of effective coupling constant ) encodes the duality properties of the model : if one writes @xmath36 in terms of @xmath38 ( the high temperatures variable ) or in terms of @xmath39 ( the variable at low temperatures ) it turns out that @xmath36 looks the same , and this is a convenient way to express the self - duality of the 2d ising model ( the self - duality of the 2d ising model was discovered in @xcite , before the discovery of its exact solution in 1944 ) . from the exact solution ( [ fi1])-([fi2 ] ) one can determine the fisher zeros of the 2d ising model , which lay on a circle in the complex @xmath39 plane . the equation determining the curve on which the fisher zeros lay is:@xmath40where",
    "@xmath5 is now a complex variable ; while in the the complex @xmath41-plane fisher zeros have the following form : @xmath42 being the fisher zeros located on a circle whose center is on the real axis , the intersection of the fisher zeros with the real axis is vertical and thus the angle @xmath16 is @xmath43 , implying @xmath44 . in the two - dimensional ising model ,",
    "the reason why the intersection at the critical point is vertical is simple : the physical singularity of the two - dimensional ising model is the real positive solution ( in @xmath5 ) of the equation @xmath45which can not be fulfilled unless @xmath46 then , let us call the complex zeros near the critical point @xmath47 ( near the critical point @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both small ) .",
    "thus , @xmath48 is implicitly defined in terms of @xmath49 by the equation@xmath50 near the critical point , when the intersection is not vertical , one can think of @xmath48 as a monotonic function of @xmath49 ( or _ viceversa _ ) .",
    "therefore , in order for @xmath48 to be defined implicitly in terms of @xmath49 by the equation above near @xmath51 , the derivative of @xmath52  with respect to @xmath49 should be different from zero . on the other hand , in order to have only one physical singularity , one has to demand the existence of only one solution of eq .",
    "( [ fi4.95 ] ) on the real positive @xmath53-axis and such a solution necessarily occurs at the maximum of @xmath54 .",
    "as long as @xmath55 is a smooth function that admits an analytic extension near @xmath21 , the derivative of @xmath52 ( defined as in eq .",
    "( [ fi5.5 ] ) ) with respect to @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath51 , and this represents an obstruction to think of @xmath48 as implicitly defined in terms of @xmath49 through ( [ fi5.5 ] ) at that point .",
    "so , no cusp in the fisher curve could exist since the curve of distributions of zeros intersects the @xmath48-axis vertically .",
    "on the other hand , in physics one is often interested in systems with non - trivial ratio @xmath32 , where the cusp manifests itself .",
    "for instance , this is what happens in the ising model in three dimensions , in what we are interested here . in order to analyze the possibility of achieving a realization yielding @xmath32",
    ", first we have to make some comments on the general form of the partition function : let us assume for a moment that for a systems with only one phase transition , near the critical point , the equation that determines the singularities can be written in the form @xmath56for some real function @xmath57 whose only positive maximum occurs at the critical point @xmath21 , being @xmath58 some dummy integration variable as in ( [ fi1 ] ) .",
    "in such a case , there is only one positive real solution occurring when both @xmath59  and @xmath60  are  at their maxima ( equal to one ) .",
    "thus , fisher zeros can be described by an equation which is formally analogous to the one of the two - dimensional ising model ; namely @xmath61 this is part of the proposal in @xcite .",
    "actually one may introduce at least implicitly a suitable @xmath62 for many statistical system ( with standard fisher zeros ) in such a way that ( [ fi6.5 ] ) represents precisely the fisher zeros of the system of interest .",
    "equations ( [ fi6 ] ) and ( [ fi6.5 ] ) simply encode the fact that there is only one physical singularity .",
    "function @xmath57 indicates how far from being self - dual a system is .",
    "therefore , according the discussion above , having a value @xmath32 would imply @xmath63 in ( [ fi6 ] ) to be non - differentiable at the critical point , where it takes its maximum value .",
    "actually , in order to achieve a cusp in the distribution of the fisher zeros , it is enough to require a non - analiticity of @xmath57 at the critical point . as a matter of fact ,",
    "our results indicate that the first derivative of @xmath57 is continuous while the second derivative is discontinuous .",
    "this is one of the hints for constructing our ansatz , as we are reminded of the fact that in three dimensions @xmath64 .    in @xcite , for the sake of simplicity ( and because of the computational resources ) a minimal duality breaking was assumed , according to what @xmath57 still was smooth at the critical point . as a result",
    ", the agreement with monte carlo data and observations was found to be very good .",
    "nevertheless , as it will be explained in the next sections , when the cusp ( @xmath65 ) in the fisher curve is implemented , the comparison with monte carlo data turns out to be even better , showing a new and more efficient way of exploring the space of parameters of the model .",
    "a powerful non - perturbative technique in field theory is the kallen - lehmann representation .",
    "such a tool allows to encode in a very natural way many analytical properties of the spectral functions .",
    "it is interesting to adapt this method ( often exclusively associated to quantum field theory ) to the analysis of the 3d ising model .",
    "this representation @xcite gives rise to an ansatz for the free energy of the three - dimensional ising model of the following form , @xmath66 , @xmath67 . ]",
    "@xmath68 ^{\\zeta _ { 2}}\\sin ^{2}y\\right ) ^{\\zeta _ { 3}}\\right ] \\right\\ } ,   \\label{fi7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and where the values of the parameters @xmath70 ( henceforth _ regge parameters _ ) in the case of the two - dimensional ising model would correspond to @xmath71 , @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "expression ( [ fi7 ] ) will be referred as kallen - lehmann free energy .",
    "the heuristic argument that suggests to write down ( [ fi7 ] ) goes as follows : think of an operator @xmath74 which `` dresses '' the trivial one - dimensional solution of the ising model giving rise to the onsager solution . then , the kallen - lehmann ansatz for the free - energy for the three - dimensional ising model is obtained by modifying @xmath75 in such a way that the parameters are @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in order to change the critical exponents one needs to change ( at least ) @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ]",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath72 now become free parameters , and then applying such a modified dressing operator @xmath79 to the onsager solution .",
    "the result is eq .([fi7 ] ) .",
    "a nice feature of this dimensional - recursive method is that it permits to distinguish between the problem of fixing five external regge parameters and @xmath80 were fixed to 1/2 ; that is , to the values they take in the two - dimensional problem .",
    "thus , already by using only three parameters , very good results in comparisons with monte - carlo data were obtained . ]",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath77 ( @xmath73 ) , and the problem of determining the function @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath57 plays the same role that @xmath34 plays in ( [ fi3 ] ) .",
    "namely , it encodes the information about how different the degrees of freedom are in the low and the high temperature regimes .",
    "thus , at least in principle , one could fix @xmath57 by analyzing how the duality is broken in the three - dimensional ising model . then",
    ", regge parameters can be found by looking , for instance , at the high temperatures behavior .",
    "an important piece of information is given by knowing which are the more relevant parameters in writing down the ansatz ( [ fi7 ] ) , as well as understanding their physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , as it will be discussed in the next sections , one learns that tuning appropriately just three regge parameters is sufficient to get an excellent agreement , both at high and at low temperatures . besides , a very good description near the critical point is also observed .",
    "our results suggest that the agreement with observations and monte carlo data improves its performance by resorting to a careful analysis of duality breaking , instead of trying to select the regge parameters _",
    "ad hoc_. from our analysis herein we achieve a substantial improvement of the method of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that our analysis is still far from being an exhaustive exploration of the whole space of parameters of the model .",
    "in fact , this is what makes the results more surprising , as the agreement with monte carlo data is excellent despite only a small piece of the moduli space was analyzed .",
    "let us now compute the internal energy in the kallen - lehman representation . a simple computation yields @xmath82 where @xmath83 ^{\\zeta _ { 2}}\\sin ^{2}y\\right ) ^{\\zeta _ { 3}},\\ \\ n\\geq 1 , \\nonumber",

    "the condition @xmath102 ( which in @xcite was imposed for simplicity ) is obtained here as being the appropriately value from the point of view of the fisher zeros .",
    "thus , the kallen - lehmann free energy is a smooth function everywhere apart from the critical point singled out by the equation ( [ fi6.5 ] ) .",
    "the previous analysis , relating fisher zeros to duality breaking , suggests how to break duality taking into account the non - triviality of the amplitude ratio @xmath32 in three dimensions . a second important ingredient in the discussion is the marchesini - shrock symmetry @xcite , which states that the partition function of ising model on regular hypercubic lattices is invariant under @xmath103 the simplest possible choice of @xmath57 which satisfies this constraint is @xmath104    in @xcite , two of the parameters @xmath105 ( @xmath73 ) have been fixed by asking the expected transition to occur at @xmath106 and by requiring the vanishing of the derivative of @xmath107 in @xmath21 , namely @xmath108    on the other hand , the other two parameters @xmath109 were chosen to be equal to those values they take in the two - dimensional model .",

    "( [ oht ] ) with the above functions ( [ critest ] ) from @xmath168 to @xmath169 yield @xmath170the agreement appears to be very good when compared with recent estimations in @xcite , where the value @xmath171 was found . in turn",

    "both theoretical and experimental determinations of @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the deviation @xmath176 of our prediction ( [ predi ] ) from observations appears to be less than 4% in all the more recent values , improving the minimal duality breaking results @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ fig - cp ] ) shows the matching between the ( non - analytic part of the ) kallen - lehmann free energy and the @xmath173 , and it confirms that in the parts of the graph of @xmath173 in which the dependence on @xmath0 is important the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "we expect that more general strong duality breaking can improve the very good agreement with observations and numerical data we found at high , low temperatures as well as at the critical point . for sake of simplicity ( and because of our computational resources ) we considered the simplest form of strong duality breaking in which ( inspired by the onsager solution in two dimensions ) the functional form of @xmath62 at high and at low temperature",
    "is the same ( see eqs .",
    "( [ fi16 ] ) and ( [ fi18 ] ) ) . in turn , in our approach the cusp in the fisher curve was implemented by the difference @xmath177 between the coefficients @xmath115 at high temperatures and the corresponding coefficients @xmath116 at low temperature .",

    "( [ fi18 ] ) to be substantially different from the one at high temperature in eq .",
    "( [ fi16 ] ) .",
    "in fact , there are infinite possible terms compatible with the marchesini - shrock symmetry that one can add to ( [ fi18 ] ) ( still satisfying conditions ( [ fi19 ] ) and ( [ fi20.5 ] ) ) so that , in a sense , the very good agreement we found here is unexpected",
    ". it would be very interesting to explore theoretical arguments to further constrain @xmath62 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "one may also try to add terms to @xmath62 compatible with the above physical requirements and see what happens .",
    "however , without a theoretical guide , the time required for an exhaustive exploration of the moduli space would be out of range .",
    "the lack of sophisticated computational resources restricted us to explore a little region of the space of parameters .",
    "in particular , some parameters ( @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) were here kept fixed to take the same values found in @xcite just as a working hypothesis , and it is likely the case the optimal values to be slightly different from those of the ansatz in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the implementation of the strong duality breaking led us to a quality leap , bringing our predictions at low temperature closer to monte carlo simulations . remarkably , at the same time our model permits to reproduce the universal amplitude ratio @xmath175 and to predict the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we studied the distribution of fisher zeros in the kallen - lehmann approach to the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "it was shown that non - trivial amplitude ratios @xmath181 are compatible with the ansatz proposed in @xcite .",
    "we proposed a mechanism ( which we called _ strong duality breaking _ ) by generating a cusp in the curve of the zeros of the free energy @xmath9 in the complex @xmath5-plane , being the cusp located at the critical point .",
    "this mechanism not only permitted us to reproduce the monte carlo prediction for the value of @xmath7 , but also led us to improve the results of @xcite bringing the predictions of the kallen - lehmann ansatz at low temperature closer to monte carlo simulations .",
    "the agreement turns out to be remarkable .",
    "in particular , the matching between our results and monte carlo estimations for the critical exponent @xmath0 and for the amplitude ratio @xmath7 exhibit a relative deviation of 3.5% and 7% respectively .    we interpret our result as a motivation to continue the investigation of phenomenological semi - analytic methods of this kind as a promising approach to solve interesting problems in statistical physics .",
