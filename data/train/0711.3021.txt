    "after the pioneering work of bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) in 1987 @xcite , many different models for self - organized criticality have been studied in different contexts ; for review see [ 2 - 5 ] . of these , models in the general class known as abelian distributed processors have been studied a lot , as they share an abelian property that makes their theoretical study simpler @xcite . the original sandpile model of bak _ et al .",
    "@xcite , the eulerian walkers model @xcite , and the manna model @xcite are all members of this class . models which do not have the abelian property have been studied mostly by numerical simulations . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the zhang model @xcite , which does not have the abelian property .    in the zhang model ,",
    "the amount of energy added at a randomly chosen site at each time step is not fixed , but random . in spite of this",
    ", the model in one dimension has the remarkable property that the energy at a site in the steady state has a very sharply peaked distribution in which the width of the peak is much less than the spread in the input amount per time step , and the width decreases with increasing system size @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior was noticed by zhang using numerical simulations in one and two dimension @xcite , and he called it the ` emergence of quasi - units ' in the steady state of the model .",
    "he argued that for large systems , the behavior would be same as in the discrete model .",
    "recently , a. fey _",
    "@xcite have proved that in one dimension , the variance of energy does go to zero as the length of the chain @xmath0 goes to infinity , but they did not study how fast it decreases with @xmath0 .    in this paper , we study this emergence of ` quasi - units ' in one dimensional zhang sandpile by looking at how the added energy is redistributed among different sites in the avalanche process .",
    "we show that the distribution function of the fraction of added energy at a site @xmath7 reaching a site @xmath2 after @xmath8 time steps following the addition is exactly equal to the probability distribution that a marked grain in the one - dimensional height type btw model added at site @xmath7 reaches site @xmath2 in time @xmath8 .",
    "the latter problem has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "we use this to show that the variance of energy asymptotically vanishes as @xmath9 .",
    "we also discuss the spatial dependence of the variance along the system length . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the variance at site @xmath2 has a scaling form @xmath3 .",
    "we determine an approximate form of the scaling function @xmath4 , which agrees very well with the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "there have been other studies of the zhang model earlier .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the steady state of the model , and found that the distribution of energies even for the two site problem is very complicated , and has a multi - fractal character . in two dimensions",
    ", the distribution of energy seems to sharpen for larger @xmath0 , but the rate of decrease of the width is very slow @xcite .",
    "most other studies have dealt with the question as to whether the critical exponents of the avalanche distribution in this model are the same as in the discrete abelian model @xcite .",
    "s results imply that the asymptotic behavior of the avalanche distribution in one dimension is indeed the same as in the discrete case , but the situation in higher dimension remains unclear @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model precisely . in section iii , we show that the calculation of the way the energy added at a site is distributed among different sites by toppling is same as the calculation of the time - dependent probability distribution of the position of a marked grain in the discrete abelian sandpile model .",
    "this correspondence is used in section iv to determine the qualitative dependence of the variance of the energy variable at a site on its position @xmath2 , and on the system size @xmath0 .",
    "we propose a simple extrapolation form that incorporates this dependence .",
    "we check our theoretical arguments with numerical simulations in section v. section vi contains a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "a detailed calculation of the solution of an equation , required in section iv , is added as an appendix .",
    "we consider our model on a linear chain of size @xmath0 .",
    "the sites are labelled by integers @xmath10 to @xmath0 and a real continuous energy variable is assigned to each site .",
    "let @xmath11 be the energy variable at site @xmath2 at the _ end _ of the time - step @xmath8 .",
    "we define a threshold energy value @xmath12 , same for each site , such that sites with @xmath13 are called unstable , and those with @xmath14 are called stable . starting from a configuration where all sites are stable , the dynamics is defined as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the system is driven by adding a random amount of energy at the _ beginning _ of every time - step at a randomly chosen site .",
    "let the amount of energy added at time @xmath8 be @xmath15 .",
    "we will assume that all @xmath16 s are independent , identically distributed random variables , each picked randomly from an uniform interval @xmath17 .",
    "let the site of addition chosen at time @xmath8 be denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "\\(ii ) we make a list of all sites whose energy exceeds or becomes equal to the critical value @xmath12 .",
    "all these sites are relaxed in parallel by topplings . in a toppling ,",
    "the energy of the site is equally distributed to its two neighbors and the energy at that site is reset to zero . if there is toppling at a boundary site , half of the energy at that site before toppling is lost .",
    "\\(iii ) we iterate step ( ii ) until all topplings stop .",
    "this completes one time step .",
    "this is the slow driving limit , and we assume that all avalanche activity stops before the next addition event . in this limit , the model is characterized by two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath12 . in the limit @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    ", the model reduces to the discrete case , where the behavior is well understood @xcite . for non - zero but small @xmath19 ,",
    "the behavior does not depend on the precise value of @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , starting with a recurrent configuration of the pile , and adding energy at some chosen site , we get exactly the same sequence of topplings for a range of values of @xmath12 @xcite . to be precise , for any fixed initial configuration , and fixed driving sequence ( of sites chosen for addition of energy ) , whether a site @xmath2 topples at time @xmath8 or not is independent of @xmath12 , so long as we have @xmath22 .",
    "in the following , we assume for simplicity that @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this case , the stationary state has at most one site with energy @xmath25 and all other sites have energy in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the position of the empty site is equally distributed among all the lattice points .",
    "there are also some recurrent configurations in which all sites have energy @xmath27 . in such cases",
    ", we shall say that the site with zero energy is the site @xmath28 . then",
    ", in the steady state , there is exactly one site with energy equal to @xmath29 , and the @xmath28 different positions of the site are equally likely .",
    "if @xmath30 does not satisfy the inequality @xmath31 , this simple characterization of the steady state is no longer valid .",
    "however , our treatment can be easily extended to those cases . since the qualitative behavior of the model is the same in all cases , we restrict ourselves to the simplest case here .",
    "it is easy to see that the toppling rules are in general not abelian .",
    "for example , start with a two site model in configuration @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the final configuration would be @xmath34 , or @xmath35 , depending on whether the first or the second site is toppled initially . in our model , using the parallel update rule , the final configuration would be @xmath36 .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that only in one dimension , for @xmath37 , the zhang model has a restricted abelian character , namely , that the final state does not depend on the order of topplings within an avalanche .",
    "however , topplings in two different avalanches do not commute .",
    "it is useful to look at the zhang model as a perturbation about the @xmath20 limit . for sufficiently small @xmath19 ,",
    "given the site of addition and initial configuration , the toppling sequence is _ independent _ of @xmath19 .",
    "it is also independent of the amount of energy of addition @xmath15 , and is same as the model with @xmath38 , which is the @xmath10-dimensional abelian sandpile model with integer heights ( hereafter referred to simply as asm , without further qualifiers ) .",
    "we decompose the energy variables as @xmath39 + \\epsilon \\eta(x , t),\\ ] ] where nint refers to the nearest integer value .",
    "then the integer part of the energy evolves as in the asm .",
    "we write @xmath40 here @xmath41 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the linearity of energy transfer in toppling implies that the evolution of the variables @xmath43 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 is a linear function of @xmath41 ; the precise function depends on the sequence of topplings that took place .",
    "these are determined by the sequence of addition sites @xmath44 up to the time @xmath8 , and the initial configuration @xmath45 .",
    "these together will be called the evolution history of the system up to time @xmath8 , and denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that at the starting time @xmath47 , the variables @xmath48 are zero for all @xmath2 , and the initial configuration is a recurrent configuration @xmath45 of the asm",
    ". then , from the linearity of the toppling rules , we can write @xmath43 as a linear function of @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and we can write for a given history @xmath46 , @xmath51 this defines the matrix elements @xmath52 . these can be understood in terms of the probability distribution of the position of a marked grain in the asm as follows .",
    "consider the motion of a marked grain in the one dimensional height type btw model .",
    "we start with configuration @xmath45 and add grains at sites according to the sequence @xmath44 .",
    "all grains are identical except the one added at time @xmath53 , which is marked . in each toppling ,",
    "the marked grain jumps to one of its two neighbors with equal probability .",
    "consider the probability that the marked grain will be found at site @xmath2 after a sequence of relaxation processes at time @xmath8 .",
    "we denote this probability as @xmath54 . from the toppling rules in both the models",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath55 averaging over different histories @xmath46 , we get the probability that a marked grain added at @xmath56 at time @xmath53 is found at a position @xmath2 at time @xmath57 in the steady state of the asm . denoting the latter probability by @xmath58 ,",
    "we get @xmath59 where the over bar denotes averaging over different histories @xmath46 , consistent with the specified constraints . here",
    ", the constraint is that @xmath46 must satisfy @xmath60 . at other places",
    ", the constraints may be different , and will be specified if not clear from the context .",
    "we shall denote the variance of a random variable @xmath6 by @xmath61 $ ] . from the definition in eq . , it is easy to show that @xmath62 =    l / ( l+1)^2 + \\epsilon^2 var[\\eta(x , t)].\\ ] ] different @xmath41 are independent random variables , also independent of @xmath46 and have zero mean .",
    "let @xmath63 = \\sigma^2 $ ] .",
    "for the case when @xmath41 has a uniform distribution between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 . then , from eq .",

    "also , for a given @xmath53 , all values of @xmath70 are equally likely .",
    "we define @xmath71 then , for large @xmath0 , in the steady state ( @xmath8 large ) , the variance of energy at site @xmath2 is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 = \\sigma^2 \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{\\infty } f(x,\\tau).\\ ] ] we define @xmath74 to be the average of @xmath75 over @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath76 evaluation of @xmath77 for a given history @xmath46 and averaging over @xmath46 is quite tedious for @xmath78 or @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the problem has been studied in the context of residence times of grains in sand piles , and some exact results are known in specific cases @xcite . for @xmath81 , the calculations are much more difficult",
    ". however , some simplifications occur in large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we discuss these in the next section .",
    "in order to find the quantity @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( 8) , we have to average @xmath83 over all possible histories @xmath46 , which is quite difficult to evaluate exactly .",
    "however , we can determine the leading behavior of @xmath82 in this limit .",
    "we use the fact that the path of a marked grain in the asm is a random walk @xcite . consider a particle that starts away from the boundaries , at @xmath84 , with @xmath0 large , and @xmath85 .",
    "if it undergoes @xmath86 topplings between the time @xmath53 and @xmath87 under some particular history @xmath46 , then its probability distribution is approximately a gaussian , centered at @xmath7 with width @xmath88 .",
    "then , we have @xmath89 using this approximation for @xmath90 , summing over @xmath7 , we get @xmath91 thus , we have to calculate the average of @xmath92 over different histories . here",
    "@xmath86 was defined as the number of topplings undergone by the marked grain .",
    "different possible trajectories of a marked grain , for a given history , do not have the same number of topplings .",
    "however , if the typical displacement of the grain is much smaller than its distance from the end , differences between these are small , and can be neglected .",
    "there are typically @xmath93 topplings per grain per avalanche in the model , and a grain moves a typical distance of @xmath94 in one avalanche .",
    "then , we can approximate @xmath86 by @xmath95 , the number of topplings at @xmath7 .",
    "let the number of topplings at @xmath7 at time steps @xmath96 be denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "then , @xmath98 .",
    "it can be shown that the number of topplings in different avalanches in the one dimensional asm are nearly uncorrelated ( in fact the correlation function between @xmath99 and @xmath100 varies as @xmath101 . ) . by the central limit theorem for sum of",
    "weakly correlated random variables , the mean value of @xmath102 grows linearly with @xmath103 , but the standard deviation increases only as @xmath104 .",
    "then , for @xmath105 , the distribution is sharply peaked about the mean , and @xmath106 .    clearly , for @xmath105 ,",
    "@xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the mean number of topplings per avalanche at @xmath7 in the asm , given by @xmath109 the upper limit on @xmath103 for the validity of the above argument comes from the requirement that the width of the gaussian be much less than the distance from the boundary , ( without any loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath110 , so that it is the left boundary ) , else we can not neglect events where the marked grain leaves the pile .",
    "this gives @xmath111 , or equivalently , @xmath112 thus we get , @xmath113^{-1/2 } , \\mathrm{~ for~~ } 0 \\ll \\tau   \\ll \\xi l,\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is some constant .    also , we know that for @xmath115 , the probability that the grain stays in the pile decays exponentially as @xmath116 @xcite . thus , @xmath80 , and also @xmath81 will decay exponentially with @xmath103 , for @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we have , for some constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 it only remains to determine the behavior of @xmath120 , for @xmath121 . in this case , in the asm , there is a significant probability that the marked grain leaves the pile from the end .",
    "this results in a faster decay of @xmath90 , and hence of @xmath122 with time .",
    "we argue below that the behavior of the function @xmath82 is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is some constant .",
    "this can be seen as follows : let us consider the special case when the particle starts at a site close to the boundary . then @xmath125 is approximately a linear function of @xmath2 for small @xmath2 .",
    "its spatial variation can not be neglected , and eq . is no longer valid .",
    "we will now argue that in this case @xmath126 the time evolution of @xmath127 in eq .",
    "is well described as a diffusion with diffusion coefficient proportional to @xmath125 which is the mean number of topplings per avalanche at @xmath2 in the asm @xcite . for understanding the long - time survival probability in this problem , we can equivalently consider the problem in a continuous - time version : consider a random walk on a half line where sites are labelled by positive integers , and the jump rate out of a site @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "a particle starts at site @xmath128 at time @xmath129 . if @xmath130 is the probability that the particle is at @xmath131 at time @xmath8 , then the equations for the time - evolution of @xmath130 are , for all @xmath132 , @xmath133 the long time solution starting with @xmath134 is @xmath135 for @xmath136 and large @xmath131 .",
    "the probability that the particle survives till time @xmath8 decreases as @xmath137 for large @xmath8 .",
    "we have discussed the calculation in the appendix .",
    "using eq . , we see that @xmath138 scales as @xmath139 .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath81 will scale as @xmath140 .",
    "then , each term in the summation for @xmath82 in eq",
    ". scales as @xmath141 , and there are @xmath103 such terms , as the sum over @xmath142 has an upper cutoff proportional to @xmath103 , and so @xmath82 varies as @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "this concludes the argument .",
    "we can put these three limiting behaviors into a single functional form that interpolates between these , as @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath118 and @xmath147 are some constants . in section v , we will see that results from numerical simulation are consistent with this phenomenological expression .    using this interpolation form in eq . , and converting the sum over @xmath103 to an integration over a variable @xmath148 , we can write @xmath149 this integral can be simplified by a change of variable @xmath150 , giving @xmath151 where @xmath152 are constants , and @xmath153 is a function defined by @xmath154 it is easy to verify that @xmath153 diverges as @xmath155 for small @xmath156 . in particular , we note that the exponential term in the integral expression for @xmath153 has a significant contribution only for @xmath157 near @xmath10 .",
    "we may approximate this by dropping the exponential factor , and changing the upper limit of the integral to @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting integral is easily done , giving @xmath158 where @xmath159 is some constant .",
    "averaging @xmath75 over @xmath2 , we get a behavior @xmath160 . of course , the answer is not exact , and one could have constructed other interpolation forms that have the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "we will see in the next section that results from numerical simulations for @xmath75 can be fitted very well to the phenomenological expression in eq . .",
    "we have tested our non - rigorous theoretical arguments against results obtained from numerical simulations . in fig . [ patch1 ] ,",

    "we plot the scaled distribution function @xmath166 versus the scaled energy @xmath167 .",
    "a good collapse is seen , which verifies the fact that the width of the peak varies as @xmath168 .     of energy per site in the steady state for different systems of size @xmath169 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",

    "we plot @xmath173 versus @xmath174 , where @xmath175 differs from @xmath2 by an amount @xmath176 to take into account the corrections due to end effects .",
    "then , for consistency , @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath177 . for the specific choice of @xmath178 and @xmath179",

    "to summarize , we have studied the emergence of quasi - units in the one - dimensional zhang sandpile model .",
    "the variance of energy variables in the steady state is governed by the balance between two competing processes .",
    "the randomness in the drive i.e. , the energy of addition , tends to increase the variance in time . on the other hand ,",
    "the topplings of energy variables tend to equalize the excess energy by distributing it to the nearby sites .",
    "there are on an average @xmath182 topplings per avalanche .",
    "hence , in one dimension there are , on an average , @xmath183 topplings per site per avalanche . for large system size",
    ", the second process dominates over the first and the variance becomes low .",
    "we have shown that the variance vanishes as @xmath184 with increasing system size and the probability distribution of energy concentrates around a non - random value which depends on the energy of addition .",
    "we have also proposed a functional form for the spatial dependence of variance of energy which incorporates the correct limiting behaviors , and matches very well with the numerical data .",
    "an interesting question is whether one can extend these arguments to the two - dimensional zhang model . in this case",
    ", there are several peaks in the distribution of energies at a site , but there are some numerical evidences for the sharpening of the peaks as the system size is increased . however , as the number of topplings per site varies only as @xmath185 , the width is expected to decrease much more slowly with @xmath0 , and the fluctuation effects can be much stronger .",
    "this remains an open question for further study .",
    "here we discuss the solution of the eq .",
    "for the starting values given by @xmath186 we start with an ansatz @xmath187 , where both @xmath18 and @xmath188 are functions only of @xmath8 .",
    "this form satisfies the eq . for all @xmath131 , @xmath189 , if @xmath18 and @xmath188 satisfy @xmath190 to solve the eq .",
    ", we first make a change of variable @xmath191 . in terms of @xmath157 ,",
    "the equation becomes @xmath192 , which can be easily integrated to give @xmath193 where @xmath194 is an integration constant . to satisfy the initial condition in eq .",
