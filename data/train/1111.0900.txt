    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in a @xmath0cr sample by the group of tilman pfau in 2005 triggered much experimental and theoretical work in the field of dipolar quantum gases @xcite .",
    "chromium atoms possess magnetic moments of @xmath1 bohr magnetons @xmath2 so that the anisotropic and long - range dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) between them is @xmath3 times larger than the one between alkali atoms .",
    "therefore , taking the influence of the ddi into account besides that of the isotropic and short - range contact interaction is essential for the correct physical description of chromium bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . up to date a few experimental signatures of the ddi in becs have been identified .",
    "the most striking ones have been found in chromium such as the modified time - of - flight dynamics @xcite , the strongly dipolar nature of a quantum ferrofluid @xcite , the d - wave bose nova explosion @xcite , and the modified low - lying excitations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ddi has also been observed in rubidium @xcite and in lithium @xcite samples . for recent reviews on the physics of dipolar bose gases",

    "@xcite .    in the case of the chromium experiments ,",
    "careful comparisons with mean - field theory @xcite were carried out and brought remarkable agreement as a result .",
    "it is important to remark that the dipolar mean - field theory is based on the construction of the corresponding pseudo - potential @xcite .    among the strongly magnetic atoms , an important place is occupied by dysprosium , which possesses the unsurpassed magnetic dipole moment of @xmath4 .",
    "recently , two major experimental achievements could be obtained with the trapping @xcite and the subsequent bose - einstein condensation @xcite of @xmath5dy by the group of benjamin lev . at present ,",
    "feshbach resonances are being searched for in dysprosium , which would provide a tuning knob for the relative strength of the ddi with respect to the contact interaction .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the possibility of using erbium as a strong magnetic atom . with a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath6 and a mass of 164 atomic mass units",
    ", erbium represents a promising candidate for studying dipolar physics @xcite , specially after the achivement of the erbium - bec @xcite .    however , atomic systems are not the only dipolar quantum systems under current investigation .",
    "indeed , the recent successes in producing and cooling heteronuclear polar molecules down to their rovibrational ground state by means of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , specially the cooling of krb molecules @xcite and the manipulation of their internal degrees of freedom @xcite let us hope that quantum degenerate heteronuclear molecular systems will soon be available experimentally . and",

    "there have also been recent important studies involving bosonic dipoles considering , for example , finite - temperature effects @xcite , exotic density profiles @xcite , and the possibility of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",

    ", the first experiments with chromium loaded into an optical lattice have been carried out @xcite .    in view of the wide - range tunability of the ddi ,",
    "polar molecules offer the possibility of testing dipolar mean - field theories all over and beyond their range of validity . for this reason ,",
    "it is important to analyze theoretically dipolar systems beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "recently , we have briefly discussed the influence of quantum fluctuations on trapped dipolar bose gases @xcite . in the present publication , we present in detail the corresponding bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory and apply it to both homogeneous and harmonically trapped gases , thereby emphasizing the importance of quantum fluctuations in strongly dipolar systems .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ bogo_sect ] , we shortly discuss the bdg theory of a bose gas at zero temperature containing a large number @xmath8 of polarized point dipoles .",

    ", we concentrate ourselves on harmonically trapped systems . by means of the local density approximation ( lda ) , we solve the bdg equations and derive the dependence of the condensate depletion and the ground - state energy on the system quantities such as the relative dipolar interaction strength and the contact gas parameter . with these results at hand , we work out a variational approach to superfluid dipolar hydrodynamics , which allows for deriving equations of motion for the thomas - fermi radii of the gas in the case of a triaxial harmonic trap .",
    "section [ cyl_sect ] is specialized to the case of a cylinder - symmetric trap and contains the solution of the equations of motion as well as discussions about beyond mean - field effects on both the static properties and the hydrodynamic excitations .",

    ". it is also convenient to introduce the dipolar length @xmath25 as a measure of the absolute dipolar strength , so that the relative interaction strength reads @xmath26 .",
    "to study the dipolar system within the bdg theory , we consider the total hamiltonian @xmath27 , which consists of a free and an interaction contribution .",

    "we argue that this non - uniqueness of the chemical potential represents a real physical property of the system . to this end",
    "we recall that the chemical potential corresponds to the energy which is needed to bring an additional particle from infinity to the already existing particle ensemble . for a homogeneous polarized dipolar bose gas it physically matters whether this additional particle is transported from infinity parallel or perpendicular to the polarized dipoles .",

    ", however , this is not the case .",
    "first , notice that the leading order of the gradient expansion is isotropic , but the next - to - leading term is not , as the spatial variation of the density is coupled to the @xmath73 space .",
    "this explains why the anisotropy of @xmath301 does not directly affect the quantum corrections at the lda level .",
    "notice that , in the usual experimental case of large particle numbers in which we are interested , the next - to - leading term can be neglected . indeed , its ratio to the lda - term can be estimated by the substitution @xmath302 , with @xmath303 the mean thomas - fermi radius and @xmath304 the momentum scale defined by the speed of sound .",

    "even for very prolate , cigar - like configurations , the system can be considered to be in the one - dimensional mean - field regime and the density variation is slow , having the form of an inverted parabola @xcite .",
    "this would provide good suppression of the variation of the interaction potential in momentum space , as can be seen from the next - to - leading term in ( [ lda_expansion ] ) . if , however , the system has a gaussian density profile , density variations are much faster , ultimately leading to a breakdown of the lda .",
    "a similar argument is valid in the case of a strongly oblate , pancake - like system , where one may consider the z - direction as frozen out .",
    "the application of the lda in the plane , then , requires a slow variation of the condensate density in the plane . that is commonly achieved experimentally such that the density profile is an inverted parabola as a function of the radial length @xcite . in view of strongly dipolar systems , it is important to notice that the criteria for the crossover between the different dimensional regimes might themselves depend on @xmath100 .",
    "this however , does alter the arguments above , since the density profiles in both regimes retain the form of inverted parabolas both in 1d and in 2d cases @xcite .",
    "the relation of the lda to the thomas - fermi approximation is , indeed , intimate , however , one can show that both are valid under quite similar assumptions . as one would expect , for a large enough particle number @xmath8 , the lda is valid as long as the system is stable , i.e. , for relative interaction strengths satisfying @xmath308 .",

    "@xcite ) , in which the s - wave scattering length is decreased on purpose in order to enhance the relative dipolar interaction strength , one might have @xmath313 for the smallest particle numbers and scattering lengths .",
