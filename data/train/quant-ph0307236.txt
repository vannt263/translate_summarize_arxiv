    "the experimental realization of one - qubit gates in solid state setups @xcite and two - qubit gates in ion traps @xcite and josephson junctions @xcite has demonstrated that these systems provide remarkable coherence properties although the goal of @xmath0 errors per gate operation @xcite has not yet been achieved experimentally .",
    "theoretical studies of decoherence of two - level systems @xcite have been extended to gate operations in the presence of an environment in refs .",
    "@xcite . the unavoidable coupling to external degrees of freedom and",
    "the thereby caused decoherence still presents a main obstacle for the realization of a quantum computer .",
    "thus , proposals for the stabilization of the coherence of qubits are particularly welcome .",
    "a variety of suggestions in this direction relies on the control of coherence by the influence of external fields .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed to use the physics of the so - called coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) for that purpose .",
    "cdt has originally been discovered in the context of tunneling in a driven bistable potential @xcite .",
    "there , it has been found that a particle which is initially in the , say , left well of a symmetric bistable potential , can be prevented from tunneling by the purely coherent influence of an oscillating driving field .",
    "this effect is stable against dissipation in the sense that the ac field also decelerates the dissipative transitions from the left to the right well @xcite thereby stabilizing coherence . for a preparation in a delocalized superposition",
    ", it has been found @xcite that the coherent dynamics is not suppressed .",
    "a different proposal for coherence stabilization is the application of a sequence of @xmath1-pulses that flip the sign of the qubit - bath coupling operator resulting in a so - called dynamical decoupling ( dd ) of qubit and bath @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this scheme is the fact that it eliminates only noise sources with a frequency below the repetition rates of the pulses .",
    "this clearly causes practical limitations .",
    "however , these limitations may be circumvented by using a related scheme based on continuous - wave driving , i.e.  one with a harmonic time - dependence , which allows higher driving frequencies .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the coherence properties of a qubit coupled to an ohmic environment which we model by a spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we consider two different types of harmonic driving : first , one that leads to coherent destruction of tunneling and , second , one that corresponds to a continuous wave version of the dynamical decoupling pulses . in section",
    "[ sec : undriven ] we review the spin - boson model for weak dissipation and derive in section [ sec : dandd ] a markovian formalism for driven dissipative qubits in the form of a basis - free master equation .",
    "the global decoherence will be qualified by an upper limit for the decoherence rate that already gives a reliable estimate for the actual value .",
    "subsequently , in sections [ cdt ] and [ dd ] , we study the coherence control by oscillating external fields .",
    "the entire system of the qubit and the environmental degrees of freedom is described by the microscopic hamiltonian @xmath2 where the qubit is formed by a two - state system with a level splitting @xmath3 , thus @xmath4 below , we will in addition consider an oscillating driving field acting on the qubit .",
    "the environment is modeled by a bath of harmonic oscillators which couple linearly to the qubit , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the oscillator frequencies and @xmath7 the qubit - bath coupling energies .",
    "the bath couples to the qubit operator @xmath8 thereby inducing bit flips , i.e.  incoherent transitions between the ground state and the excited state of the qubit .    we complete the model by choosing an initial condition @xmath9 , of the feynman - vernon type , i.e. , we assume that at time @xmath10 the bath is in thermal equilibrium and uncorrelated with the qubit , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the reduced density operator of the qubit and @xmath13 is the canonical ensemble of the bath at the inverse temperature @xmath14 .      from the liouville - von neumann equation",

    "the notation @xmath18 is a shorthand for @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the propagator for the coherent qubit dynamics .",
    "note that for later use , we have written the master equation already in a form which is also valid in the case of an explicit time - dependence of the qubit hamiltonian .",
    "the dissipative equation of motion depends on the bath through the symmetric and anti - symmetric correlation functions of the bath operator @xmath21 , given by @xmath22\\right\\rangle =    -\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty \\d\\omega j(\\omega ) \\sin(\\omega \\tau),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the angular brackets @xmath23 denote the average with respect to the thermal equilibrium of the bath .",
    "we have introduced for the qubit - bath coupling the spectral density @xmath24 if the bath modes are dense , @xmath25 becomes a smooth function . within the present work",
    ", we will consider the case of ohmic dissipation where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a dimensionless measure for the dissipation strength .",
    "the so - called cutoff frequency @xmath28 is assumed to be the highest frequency of the bath .",
    "if the cutoff frequency is much larger than all relevant energy scales , the antisymmetric correlation function @xmath29 can be replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "then , for the integral in the master equation , the part containing @xmath29 can be evaluated after integrating by parts to read @xmath31,\\rho\\}].\\ ] ]    to bring the master equation into a more explicit form , we insert the heisenberg operator @xmath32 which is readily derived from its definition together with the qubit hamiltonian . performing the integration over @xmath33 and @xmath34 and neglecting renormalization effects , which are small provided that @xmath35 , yields for @xmath36 , the markovian master equation @xmath37 -\\frac{\\gamma}{4}[\\sigma_x,[\\sigma_x,\\rho ] ] + \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\pi\\alpha\\delta}{4}[\\sigma_x,\\{\\sigma_y,\\rho\\}].\\ ] ] we will find below that the relaxation and decoherence processes are determined by the rate @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the power spectrum of the bath fluctuations , i.e.  the fourier transformed of the symmetric bath correlation function .",
    "this master equation is a basis - free version of a bloch - redfield or floquet - markov master equation @xcite .",
    "such an operator notation is preferable to a decomposition into the qubit s eigenbasis for ease of notation and , moreover , since it allows a more elegant computation of expectation values .",
    "the interpretation of is that the first term of the right - hand side is responsible for the coherent dynamics , while the second and third term correspond to decoherence and relaxation .",
    "for the description of dynamics of a single qubit , it is convenient to map the density operator to the bloch vector @xmath40 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive for the bloch vector from the master equation the inhomogeneous linear equation of motion @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the weak dissipation limit , @xmath43 , the matrix @xmath44 has the eigenvalues @xmath45 while the first eigenvalue describes the decay of the population of the excited state , the other two correspond to damped oscillations of the off - diagonal density matrix elements in the basis eigenbasis of the qubit hamiltonian .",
    "this justifies for @xmath46 the designation _ relaxation rate _ and the definition of the _ decoherence rate _ @xmath47 . for larger systems",
    "there is room for several relaxation ( purely real eigenvalues ) and decoherence rates ( complex eigenvalues with non - vanishing imaginary parts ) .",
    "relaxation and decoherence are nonunitary processes , i.e.  processes which transform a pure state into a mixed state . since a quantum computer relies fundamentally on the coherence of the time evolution , such processes put an essential limitation and their influence has to be minimized .",
    "thus , in order to follow the process of coherence loss , it is desirable to define proper coherence measures which preferably are independent of the chosen basis . a natural possibility that comes to mind is the shannon entropy @xmath48 .",
    "however , this measure is sometimes inconvenient due to the appearance of the logarithm . therefore , it is common to use instead the `` linear entropy '' @xcite @xmath49 which is a good approximation for the shannon entropy for almost pure states and is closely related to the so - called purity @xmath50 .",
    "the history of this kind of measure is long , and can be traced back to at least 1939 @xcite .",
    "the linear entropy possesses a convenient physical interpretation : suppose that @xmath12 describes an incoherent mixture of @xmath51 orthogonal states with equal probability , then @xmath50 reads @xmath52 .",
    "for a single qubit the maximum linear entropy is therefore 1/2 .",
    "it is zero if and only if @xmath12 describes a pure state .",
    "the decoherence rate is well described by the entropy production @xmath53 which follows directly from the master equation , respectively from the equation of motion for the bloch vector .",
    "obviously , the coherent dynamics given by the first commutator in the master equation does not increase the entropy .    in the context of quantum computing , we are mainly interested in the entropy production for ( almost ) pure states , i.e.  the initial entropy production which is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath44 .",
    "since these eigenvalues are invariant under unitary transformations , they represent a global measure for the influence of the dissipation . in particular , they are independent of the choice of the basis . in the worst case ,",
    "the decoherence is determined by the eigenvalue with the largest real part .    for the driven system considered below ,",
    "the matrix becomes time - dependent and , consequently , the eigenvalues must be replaced by the eigenvalues of a floquet equation .",
    "their computation , however , might be quite cumbersome .",
    "therefore , a more convenient measure which is also applicable to driven systems is the sum @xmath54 of all eigenvalues which can be computed without explicit diagonalization by the trace of the matrix @xmath44 , @xmath55 since @xmath54 is real and larger than all real parts of the eigenvalues ( which are positive ) , it represents an upper bound for the decoherence rate .",
    "moreover , for the present case , the largest real part of an eigenvalue is at least @xmath56 and , thus , we can conclude that @xmath54 gives the correct order of magnitude for the decoherence rate of the most fragile initial state .",
    "a further related , but more probabilistic measure , that characterizes the loss of coherence , is the average @xmath57 over all pure initial states of the entropy production and reads @xmath58",
    "to study the controllability of the decoherence , we generalize the master equation to the case where a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath59 acts on the qubit .",
    "we assume that time - dependence @xmath60 is periodic with the driving period @xmath61 and has zero average .",
    "then , according to the floquet theorem @xcite , the corresponding propagator can always be written in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 obeys the time - periodicity of the driving field .",
    "the floquet propagator @xmath64 depends only on the time difference and contains non - adiabatic phases which emerge during the propagation over one driving period @xcite .",
    "since @xmath65 is time - periodic , the long - time dynamics of the driven qubit is entirely determined by the one - period propagator @xmath66 .    inserting the propagator into the master equation results after the @xmath33-integration in a dissipative kernel that still depends periodically on the final time @xmath67 . however , since we consider the case of fast driving , it is possible to separate time - scales and replace the rapidly oscillating operators in the master equation by their time - averages . in doing so",
    ", we arrive at @xcite @xmath68 -\\frac{1}{4}[\\sigma_x,[q,\\rho ] ] + \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\pi\\alpha\\delta}{4}[\\sigma_x,\\{\\sigma_y,\\rho\\}],\\ ] ] where the difference with respect to the master equation for the static case comes from replacing in the second commutator @xmath69 by the operator @xmath70 the master equation for the driven , dissipative qubit reflects the close resemblance to the master equation valid in the static case . the last term in is not modified by the driving .",
    "the reason for this is that the driving enters linearly in and , consequently , vanishes in the average over the driving period . however , besides the explicit presence of the time - dependent hamiltonian in the coherent contribution , also the dissipative part has acquired a change : the coupling operator @xmath8 is now replaced by an operator @xmath71 that depends on the qubit propagator in the presence of the driving . as a consequence , we expect in the case of strong driving fields not only a modification of the coherent dynamics , but also of the coherence properties . in the following sections",
    ", we will investigate two typical types of driving : as a result , we find that they can alter the coherence times rather significantly .",
    "as a first example for the significant influence of the driving field , we investigate the qubit under the influence of the hamiltonian @xmath72 which couples like the bath to the qubit by via the operator @xmath8 and , thus , commutes with the qubit - bath coupling .",
    "such a time - dependent field causes already interesting effects for the coherent qubit dynamics that we will briefly review before discussing decoherence .    to sketch the coherent dynamics of the driven qubit",
    ", we first transform the hamiltonian @xmath73 by the unitary operator @xmath74 this transformation defines the interaction picture with respect to @xmath75 and results in the likewise @xmath76-periodic hamiltonian @xmath77 the corresponding schrdinger equation can not be integrated exactly since @xmath78 does not commute with itself at different times and , thus , time - ordering has to be taken into account . we restrict ourselves to an approximate solution and neglect corrections of the order @xmath79 . within this approximation , the propagator is simply given by the exponential of the integral of the time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "this consists of two parts : first , there is the time - average of @xmath78 which determines the leading contribution to the floquet propagator @xmath80 .",
    "the second part comprises terms that oscillate with the driving period . for a high - frequency driving with @xmath81 , this latter contribution",
    "can be neglected since the periodic part of the propagator is dominated by the contribution @xmath82 coming directly from the driving .",
    "this approach is equivalent to a perturbational computation of floquet states @xcite as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "finally , the qubit propagator in the interaction picture defined by , is determined by the time average of the hamiltonian which reads @xmath83 this static approximation to the driven qubit hamiltonian is of the same form as the original hamiltonian , but with the tunneling matrix element renormalized according to @xmath84 here , @xmath85 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "thus , within this high - frequency approximation , the entire propagator for the qubit in the schrdinger picture reads @xmath86    of particular interest are now driving parameters for which @xmath87 corresponds to a zero of the bessel function @xmath85 , i.e.  for which @xmath88 vanishes .",
    "then the one - period propagator @xmath66 , becomes the identity . or in other words",
    ": the long - time dynamics is suppressed .",
    "the dynamics within the driving period requires a closer look at the periodic propagator @xmath65 : for an initial preparation in an eigenstate of @xmath8 , it contributes only a global phase , such that the dynamics as a whole is suppressed also within the driving period .",
    "this effect of suppressing the time - evolution by the purely coherent influence of an external field has been investigated first in the context of driven tunneling @xcite and is named `` coherent destruction of tunneling '' ( cdt ) . however , for a preparation other than an eigenstate of @xmath8 , the periodic propagator @xmath65 will still cause a non - trivial dynamics within the driving period .",
    "this fact has been found numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is also a significant influence of the driving on the dissipative dynamics of a particle with an initial preparation in an eigenstate of @xmath8 : besides slowing down the coherent time evolution , also the dissipative transitions are decelerated , i.e. the rate for the dissipative transitions between the wells of a bistable system becomes lower . in the following ,",
    "we investigate decoherence and dissipation under such a cdt driving without the restriction to a specific preparation .    in order to evaluate the coefficients of the master equation valid in the driven case",
    ", we have to compute the operator @xmath71 .",
    "this requires an explicit expression for the propagator @xmath89 starting at time @xmath90 and , thus , we have to consider initial phases . repeating the calculation from the beginning of this",
    "section yields @xmath91\\sigma_x \\right )    \\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\delta_\\mathrm{eff}\\tau}{2}\\sigma_z \\right ) , \\ ] ] where the first factor is the time - periodic part @xmath92 while the second factor determines the long - time dynamics .",
    "since @xmath65 commutes with @xmath8 , only the floquet propagator @xmath64 is relevant for the operator . after performing the time and the frequency integration we find @xmath93",
    "thus , the master equation is of the same form as in the undriven case , eq .  , but with @xmath46 replaced by @xmath94 since the spectral density @xmath95 increases monotonically with the frequency @xmath34 and , moreover , the bessel function @xmath96 for @xmath97 , dissipation and decoherence become smaller due to the driving .    again , we employ the trace of the matrix @xmath44 appearing in the equation of motion for the bloch vector as a criterion for the global decoherence strength and find @xmath98 which represents within the high - frequency approximation an upper limit for the decoherence rates . for high temperatures ,",
    "@xmath99 , the @xmath100 in the power spectrum can be replaced by the inverse of its argument .",
    "this defines the classical limit where the decoherence rate becomes @xmath101 , i.e.  independent of the effective tunnel splitting @xmath88 . in the low temperature limit @xmath102 ,",
    "the @xmath100 becomes unity and , thus , @xmath103 which means that decoherence becomes smaller by a factor @xmath104 .",
    "this reduction of decoherence is brought about by the fact that the driving decelerates the long time dynamics of the qubit .",
    "thereby , the frequencies which are relevant for the decoherence are shifted to a range where the spectral density of the bath is lower .",
    "consequently , the influence of the bath is diminished .",
    "since @xmath105 represents an upper bound for the decoherence rate , this demonstrates that coherence stabilization via cdt is a phenomenon that is independent of the initial state .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the _ coherent _ dynamics is slowed down by the same factor as the _ decoherence _ , cf.eqs .   and .",
    "thus , if for a specific application , the figure of merit is the number of coherent oscillations , the present coherence stabilization scheme may not prove useful . for resonant",
    "driving , this unfavorable situation can change for certain preparations , see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "a recently proposed mechanism for coherence stabilization is the so - called dynamical decoupling @xcite .",
    "this scheme employs sequences of @xmath1-pulses which flip the sign of the operator that couples the qubit to the bath operators .",
    "the basic idea originates from the suppression of spin diffusion in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments @xcite and has become an established technique in that area @xcite . in the present case where the bath couples to the operator @xmath8 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , such a transformation is e.g.  induced by the hamiltonian @xmath106 for a pulse duration @xmath107 . since",
    "the corresponding propagator is a function of the qubit hamiltonian , the coherent dynamics is not altered .",
    "besides the prospective benefits of such a control scheme , there is also a number of possible drawbacks that the application of @xmath1-pulses might cause : for a driven system , there is always the possibility of unwanted off - resonant transitions @xcite , especially in the case of sharp pulses .",
    "a more practical limitation is the fact that only noise with frequencies below the pulse repetition rate can be eliminated in such a way .",
    "these disadvantages can be overcome partially by applying a continuous wave version of the dynamical decoupling scheme , i.e.  a driving of the form @xmath108 for which the available frequency range is larger .",
    "this constitutes our second example of a driving field influencing considerably the qubit decoherence .",
    "in contrast to the driving hamiltonian employed in the previous section , the present one commutes with the static qubit hamiltonian and , consequently , the propagator for the driven qubit can be computed exactly to read @xmath109",
    "\\sigma_z\\right )    \\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\delta\\sigma_z(t - t')\\right ) .\\ ] ] again , we have written the propagator in the form which is suitable for simplifying the master equation . inserting this into the expression results for @xmath110 in the effective coupling operator @xmath111 in order to derive this expression",
    ", we have decomposed the exponentials of the trigonometric functions into a fourier series using the identity @xmath112=\\sum_k j_k(x ) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}k\\omega t)$ ] , where @xmath113 is the @xmath114th order bessel function of the first kind @xcite . like in the previous cases ,",
    "the effective coupling operator @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath8 and , thus , the master equation is again of the form .",
    "the only change for the dissipative dynamics is the replacement of @xmath46 by @xmath116 the decoherence rate in this case depends on the spectral density of the bath at multiples of the driving frequency which may be larger than the cutoff frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath1-pulses applied in the original version version @xcite of dynamical decoupling , correspond for a continuous driving to a field amplitude such that @xmath87 equals the first zero of the bessel function @xmath85 , i.e.  assumes a value @xmath117 .",
    "then only the sum in eq",
    ".   contributes to the decoherence rate @xmath118 .",
    "if now the driving frequency is larger than the cutoff of the spectral density , @xmath119 , the decoherence rate is considerably reduced : for low temperatures , @xmath120 , the hyperbolic tangent in the decoherence rate become unity and each contribution is weighted by a possibly large factor @xmath121 . in the high - temperature limit @xmath122 ,",
    "we use @xmath123 and find that the dependence of the prefactor on @xmath124 cancels .",
    "this means that the dynamical decoupling scheme is especially useful for high temperatures .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the driving shifts the qubit dynamics towards high frequencies where the thermal occupation of the bath modes is negligible .     as a function of the driving frequency for dynamical decoupling for different temperatures .",
    "the cutoff frequency is @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and the dissipation strength is @xmath127 .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines mark the values above which the coherence is improved on average ( @xmath128 ) and for an arbitrary initial condition ( @xmath129 ) , respectively .",
    "[ fig : dd ] ]    to assess the coherence stabilization originating from dynamical decoupling , we define for the coherence stabilization the rather conservative measure @xmath130 i.e.  the ratio between the lowest decoherence rate _ without _ driving and the largest decoherence rate _ with _ driving , cf .  equations and . for parameters such",
    "that @xmath129 , it is granted that the driving stabilizes the coherence independent of the initial state .",
    "if @xmath128 , we still can conclude that the coherence is improved in the average over all possible initial states .",
    "figure [ fig : dd ] compares the coherence stabilization @xmath131 as a function of the driving frequency for @xmath126 , i.e.  close to a zero of the bessel function @xmath85 .",
    "it reveals that for driving frequencies well below the cutoff , the driving rather spoils the coherence .",
    "this improves with increasing driving frequency and , finally , for a high - frequency driving @xmath131 becomes much larger than unity corresponding to a significant coherence stabilization .",
    "the data demonstrate the usefulness of dynamical decoupling for high temperatures discussed above .",
    "we have investigated the coherence properties of a qubit weakly coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath under the influence of an external driving field .",
    "two types of driving have been taken into account : one that can cause coherent destruction of tunneling and another that corresponds to @xmath1-pulses that invert the sign of the qubit - bath coupling operator . to estimate the decoherence ,",
    "we have derived an upper bound for the decoherence rate . as a result",
    ", we have found that both types of driving can enhance the coherence properties of the qubit significantly , independent of the preparation .    in the case of cdt",
    "we have found that the main effect comes from the fact that the driving shifts the coherent long - time dynamics of the qubit towards lower frequencies where the spectral density of an ohmic bath is lower and , thus , the effective coupling is weaker .",
    "consequently , decoherence is generally reduced .",
    "this is most pronounced at low temperatures . for high temperatures , however ,",
    "the lower spectral density is counterbalanced by an increasing thermal noise , such that decoherence becomes independent of the driving .    for the continuous - wave dynamical decoupling scheme , we have found that a low - frequency driving is counterproductive .",
    "however , once the frequency exceeds the bath cutoff , the coherence properties recover and are finally significantly improved , especially at high temperatures .",
    "since such a dynamical decoupling by a harmonic driving allows higher driving frequencies than the pulsed version , this form of coherence stabilization bear interesting perspectives for applications .",
