    "since their experimental confirmation two decades ago , neutrino oscillations have been extensively studied and all but two parameters have been precisely measured : the neutrinos mass ordering and a cp violating phase  @xcite .",
    "this observation constitutes the only signal of new physics observed so far that absolutely calls for an extension of the standard model ( sm ) . a simple and attractive possibility to generate neutrino masses and",
    "mixing is the inverse seesaw ( iss ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it extends the sm by adding pairs of fermionic singlets with a seesaw scale close to the electroweak scale and naturally large neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "however , the sm suffers from other theoretical and observational issues like the absence of a dark matter candidate or the hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) naturally solves these problems and the supersymmetric inverse seesaw model addresses all these issues in a common framework where all the new physics is located around the tev scale .    while many neutrino mass generating mechanisms lead to the same phenomenology when it comes to neutrino oscillations , they can be distinguished by searching for the effects of the new particles that they introduce .",
    "those effects can be modified decay chains at high - energy colliders due to the production of the new particles or indirect effects in low - energy experiments . charged lepton flavour violating ( clfv )",
    "processes are particularly attractive since they are free from standard model background and their cross - sections strongly depend on the model considered .",
    "besides , there is an intense experimental effort in this field and huge sensitivity improvements are expected in the future , up to five orders of magnitude for neutrinoless @xmath1 conversion for example  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on clfv radiative and 3-body lepton decays as well as neutrinoless @xmath0 conversion in muonic atoms .",
    "further details , including all formulas , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric inverse seesaw consists of the mssm extended by three pairs of gauge singlet superfields , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , with opposite lepton number , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the superpotential of this model is given by @xmath7 with @xmath8 the superpotential of the mssm .",
    "the corresponding terms of the soft susy breaking lagrangian are given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 the soft susy breaking terms of the mssm .",
    "the only terms that violate lepton number conservation are the majorana mass term @xmath11 and the last two terms of the soft susy breaking lagrangian , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , taking them to zero increases the symmetry of the model , making their smallness natural .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath14 neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath15 in the basis @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the vacuum expectation value of the up - type higgs boson .",
    "assuming @xmath19 , the neutrino mass matrix can be block - diagonalized to give the effective mass matrix for the light neutrinos  @xcite @xmath20 while the heavy neutrinos form pseudo - dirac pairs with masses corresponding approximately to the eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "[ mlight ] that the lightness of the active neutrinos is directly related to the overall smallness of @xmath22 .",
    "this decouples the smallness of the active neutrino masses from the product @xmath23 that controls the active - sterile mixing , potentially allowing for large effects in low - energy observables .",
    "in this work , we focused on coherent neutrinoless @xmath0 conversion in nuclei , the clfv radiative decays @xmath24 and the following 3-body decays : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the analytical formulas for the corresponding decay widths in terms of form factors , as well as the detailed calculation of these form factors including all possible contributions at the one - loop level in the mass basis can be found in our main article  @xcite .",
    "the current upper limits on the branching ratio of these processes and the expected sensitivities are given in table  [ sensi ] .",
    ".current experimental bounds and future sensitivities for the clfv observables considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while this choice does not always lead to a mass in agreement with cms and atlas measurements for the lightest cp - even higgs boson , this does not impact the validity of our results . indeed",
    ", higgs - mediated contributions are subdominant for @xmath28 and our results exhibit only a mild dependence on @xmath29 which could be adjusted to obtain the proper higgs boson mass .",
    "the first observable that we present is the decay @xmath30 .",
    "its behaviour is representative of other radiative decays and it is one of the most constrained clfv processes , with @xmath31 at @xmath32  cl obtained by the meg experiment  @xcite and an expected improvement in sensitivity to @xmath33 after upgrade  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ crfig ] where the grey area in fig .",
    "[ muegamma - scatter ]    corresponds to the region of the cmssm parameter space excluded by the atlas search  @xcite .",
    "we can see from both plots that our predictions saturate the current experimental limit and the dominant contribution is dictated by the lightest scale , @xmath21 or @xmath34 . if @xmath35 , the non - susy contribution dominates and vice versa .",
    "the dip in the non - susy contribution comes from a cancellation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 diagrams , whose matrix elements have opposite signs . the presence of this dip in fig .",
    "[ muegamma - scatter ] can be explained by the fact that scalar masses are functions of @xmath34 , explaining the dependence of non - susy contributions on @xmath34 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that this dependence disappears when taking the sm limit for the scalar sector .    in fig .",
    "[ crfig1 ] ,    we present our results for @xmath38 .",
    "it is the clfv 3-body decay with the lowest current experimental limit , the sindrum collaboration providing the upper bound @xmath39 at @xmath32  cl  @xcite .",
    "while clfv radiative decays receive contributions only from dipole operators , the phenomenology of clfv 3-body decays is much richer with box diagrams , z- , @xmath40- and higgs - penguins . the latest are not included in fig .",
    "[ crfig1 ] since we found their contribution to be negligible at @xmath28 but it would be sizeable at large @xmath41  @xcite , typically above 50 . in the case",
    "presented here , we found that the dominant susy contribution comes from @xmath40-penguins , while the dominant non - susy contribution comes from boxes .",
    "while the latter can saturate the current experimental bound , it interferes destructively with z - penguins , which can reduce the total branching ratio by up to one order of magnitude at large @xmath21 .",
    "this clearly illustrates the need for a full computation and will have to be taken into account when interpreting future experimental results .",
    "we can now turn to neutrinoless @xmath42 conversion in muonic atoms which similarly exhibits a rich phenomenology as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ crfig5 ] .    here",
    ", the cancellation between non - susy boxes and z - penguins is even more important than for @xmath38 and , again , the dominant susy contribution comes from @xmath40-penguin .",
    "akin to @xmath38 , the conversion rate can be large enough to saturate current experimental bounds .",
    "the major difference is the appearance of a dip in the full contribution .",
    "this can easily be explained by the fact that the separate ( additive ) contributions for the diagrams involving quarks partially have different relative signs with respect to each other , which was not the case for those involving leptons .",
    "having discussed each type of clfv observables that we considered , let us compare them with the current experimental limits and future sensitivities in mind .",
    "this can be done by plotting together the three types of observables as in fig .",
    "[ crfig4 ] .",
    "first , we can see that the branching ratio of @xmath30 is the largest one in most of the parameter space explored .",
    "combined with the very stringent upper limit from the meg experiment of @xmath43  @xcite , this makes @xmath30 the most constraining observable in our model nowadays and in the near future .",
    "while the branching ratio of @xmath38 is usually smaller , this observable offers the best mid - term improvement in sensitivity , the mu3e proposal  @xcite mentioning a sensitivity of @xmath44 for the phase i in 2016 and an ultimate sensitivity of @xmath45 . in the long term , experiments searching for",
    "neutrinoless @xmath0 conversion will provide the largest improvement in sensitivity , up to five orders of magnitude and reaching sensitivities down to @xmath46 around 2020 .",
    "they will then be able to probe a large part of the parameter space , putting strong constraints on this model .",
    "we have focused on @xmath22 decays up to know as they are strongly constrained and they allow to discuss the three types of clfv observables that we have studied .",
    "we refer the interested reader to our main article  @xcite for results concerning @xmath47 decays .",
    "we have also discussed there the impact of the misalignment between light and heavy neutrinos as well as the effect of a non - degenerate @xmath48 matrix .",
    "there is however one last observable that would be of great interest at future b factories : the ratio of 3-body decays @xmath49 .",
    "a generic prediction of the supersymmetric inverse seesaw is that @xmath50 .",
    "however , the exact value of their ratio is very sensitive to the dominant contribution as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ crfig2 ] .",
    "thus , these ratios can be used to pinpoint the dominant contribution and learn more about the mechanism at the origin of lfv . for completeness , we note that the branching ratios of @xmath51 decays are strongly suppressed , at least by a factor of @xmath52 with respect to the other 3-body decays , as they require an additional flavour violating vertex .",
    "in this work , we provide for the first time a complete calculation of clfv lepton decays and neutrinoless @xmath1 conversion in muonic atoms in the supersymmetric inverse seesaw , taking into account all susy and non - susy contributions .",
    "we have found that for small @xmath21 or large @xmath34 , the non - susy contributions dominate . in particular , for 3-body decays and @xmath0 conversion , the largest contributions come from boxes and z - penguins which partially cancel each other , reducing the total branching ratio by up to one order of magnitude . in the large @xmath21 or small @xmath34 regime , the susy contributions dominate , especially the @xmath40-penguins .",
    "we expect these results to be quite generic and to hold for other low - scale seesaw models with right - handed neutrinos and nearly conserved lepton number .",
    "in fact , our findings agree with previous results in low - scale type i seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "all types of observables can already be used to constrain the parameter space of the supersymmetric inverse seesaw . however , due to the huge improvements in experimental sensitivities expected in the upcoming years , the most promising observable depends on the time scale considered . in the short - term , it will be @xmath30 , while @xmath38 should be the most constraining around 2016 and @xmath1 would give the most stringent limits around 2020 .",
    "finally , we have shown that ratios of 3-body @xmath47 decays will be extremely useful in finding the dominant contribution to clfv processes .",
