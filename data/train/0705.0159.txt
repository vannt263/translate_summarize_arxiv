    "one of the original applications of the holographic principle was in relating the entropy of a black hole to the area of its horizon @xcite ; since then a variety of authors have continued to explore relationships between bulk and boundary physics via holography , most notably via the ads / cft correspondence of maldacena @xcite .",
    "the idea of entropy being linked with an area rather than a volume ( as one naturally expects from thermodynamics ) is not , however , restricted to the case of black holes .",
    "recently , a proposal was put forward by ryu and takayanagi @xcite relating the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in a cft to the area of a minimal surface in the bulk .",
    "this has been investigated further in a number of subsequent papers , such as @xcite where a number of related issues are explored .",
    "one avenue of interest leading from this proposal is the question of whether we can take this link between the entanglement entropy and minimal surface area , and devise a method to efficiently extract the bulk physics from the field theory information .    in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions ,",
    "the area of the minimal surface in question corresponds to the length of a static spacelike geodesic connecting the two endpoints of the region a through the bulk , as illustrated in figure [ stat1 ] .",
    "it is this observation that leads to comparisons with a method of extracting the bulk metric given in @xcite , where the relation between singularities in correlation functions in the cft and null geodesics ( see @xcite for details ) was used to iteratively recover the bulk metric in certain asymptotically ads spacetimes . in this paper",
    "we devise a similar method for extracting the bulk metric , using instead the relationship of ryu and takayanagi between the entanglement entropy and the length of the relevant spacelike geodesic .",
    "interestingly , we find that after plotting the proper length against the angular separation of the endpoints , see figure [ lvsphi ] , the gradient @xmath0 immediately yields the angular momentum of the corresponding static spacelike geodesic .",
    "this simple relation then allows the minimum radius of the geodesic to be determined , and by working iteratively from large @xmath1 , one can reconstruct the metric function of the bulk .    after describing the method and giving some examples of its application in practice",
    ", we then make a number of comparisons between this and the method of @xcite ( which is briefly reviewed in section [ sec : review ] ) .",
    "most crucially , the two methods involve different ways of probing the bulk ( as they involve different types of geodesic path ) , and whilst they appear computationally quite similar , this difference allows the method presented here to probe more fully a greater range of asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in singular spacetimes , and those with a significant deviation from pure ads , the effective potential for the null paths can become non - monotonic , resulting in geodesics which go into unstable orbits , see figure [ mv1 ] .",
    "this local maximum in the potential results in a finite range of radii which can not be effectively probed by the null geodesics , and information about the bulk can not be extracted ; one does not encounter this problem when probing with static spacelike geodesics , provided the metric function is non - singular . despite this advantage",
    ", one can not use either method individually to extract information from the most general static , spherically symmetric spacetimes ( those with a metric of the form of ) , as neither can provide enough data with which to fully determine the metric ; the null geodesics are not sensitive to the overall conformal factor of the metric , and the static spacelike geodesics can not probe the timelike part .",
    "one can , however , use them in conjunction in order to do so .",
    "we thus conclude by proposing a combination of the two approaches such that the bulk information can be recovered , and give firstly an example demonstrating the ease with which it can be done , followed by a toy model setup of a gas of radiation ( a `` star '' ) in @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrate how it is possible to determine both the star s mass and density profiles from our estimates of the metric functions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section [ sec : backg ] contains background material on asymptotically ads spacetimes and geodesic paths , and introduces the entanglement entropy relation from @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : method1 ] develops the method for iteratively extracting the bulk metric , the full details of which are given in appendix a , comments on the validity of the solutions , and goes on to give examples . in section [ sec : compari ] , after a review of the null geodesic approach from @xcite , the comparison between this and the spacelike method developed here follows , where we analyse their similarities and differences in applicability and efficiency .",
    "finally , the two methods are combined in section [ sec : combo ] , to produce a more generally applicable method ( as illustrated with the recovery of the pertinent information about a `` star '' in @xmath2 ) and we go on to look at extensions of the method to less symmetric cases in section [ sec : extension ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] with a discussion and summary of the results .",
    "recall the metric for @xmath2 in coordinates @xmath3 : @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ads radius .",
    "the existence of killing vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 leads to two conserved quantities ( energy ( e ) and angular momentum ( j ) ; here we use @xmath9 to avoid confusion with @xmath10 , which denotes the length of the system in the cft ( see section [ sec : method1 ] ) . ] ) , and allows the geodesic equations to be written in the simple form :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 for some affine parameter @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is an effective potential for the geodesics , defined by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 for spacelike , timelike and null geodesics respectively .",
    "note that only null and spacelike geodesics can reach the boundary at @xmath17 in finite coordinate time , and so these are the geodesics we work with when relating bulk physics to the boundary .",
    "the paths of a sample of null and spacelike geodesics through @xmath2 are shown in figure [ geopaths1 ] , where one observes that the null geodesics all terminate at the antipodal point on the boundary , see figure [ modnullfig1 ] in section [ sec : review ] . ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the spacelike geodesic endpoints , where there is a both an angular and temporal spread in their distribution , obtained by varying @xmath9 and @xmath18 ( except in the @xmath19 case , which we focus on here , where the geodesics are all contained in a constant time slice ) .",

    "now , in @xcite , the metric information was extracted by using the endpoints of null geodesics and their relation to correlation functions in the field theory . here",
    "we propose to use the endpoints of static spacelike geodesics in three dimensions , and the relation between their proper length and the entanglement entropy of a two dimensional cft proposed in @xcite to extract the bulk information .      in @xcite ,",
    "ryu and takayanagi propose that the entanglement entropy @xmath24 ( in a @xmath25 ) of subsystem a with @xmath26-dimensional boundary @xmath27 is given by the area law :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the static minimal surface whose boundary is given by @xmath27 , and @xmath30 is the newton constant in @xmath31 dimensions . in the @xmath32 case , @xmath29 will be given by a geodesic line , and thus if we consider @xmath2 with a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional cft living on its boundary , and define two regions a and b on the boundary as in figure [ stat1 ] , ryu and takayanagi s proposal relates the proper length of the static spacelike geodesic shown to the entanglement entropy @xmath24 .",
    "thus by considering a complete set of these geodesics , we can probe the entire spacetime from out near the boundary down to the centre at @xmath33 corresponds to that for a black hole , one can probe down to the horizon radius , @xmath34 , see section [ sec : singspaces ] .",

    "focussing on spacelike geodesics , and specifically those with zero energy ( i.e. static ) , we have that :    @xmath36    which can be combined with the angular momentum conservation equation @xmath37 to give :    @xmath38    this can then be re - cast as an integral equation along the geodesic path , where we note that the final angular separation will be a function of @xmath9 only : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is minimum radius obtained by the geodesic , and in the zero energy case is given simply by @xmath41 .",
    "as the metric is divergent at the boundary @xmath17 , we introduce a cut - off @xmath42 and restrict ourselves to the region @xmath43 .",
    "] we also have that the proper length of the geodesic ( also dependent only on @xmath9 ) is given by :    @xmath44    these two equations , and , will form the basis for our method of extracting the metric function @xmath35 at each @xmath1 .    now , given that the spacetime in which we are working is asymptotically ads , we can say that for @xmath45 for some @xmath46 which can be arbitrarily large ( but still below the cut - off @xmath42 ) , @xmath47 ( with r set to one ) .",
    "thus all static spacelike geodesics with angular momentum @xmath48 will remain sufficiently far from the central deformation @xmath22 such that they remain undisturbed by its effects , and in the limiting case @xmath49 we can write : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and is the length of section b of the boundary in figure [ stat1 ] .",
    "hence from the @xmath52 endpoints , which are specified by the our choice of region a in the cft , we can determine @xmath46 and we have that @xmath53 .",
    "this will be the starting point for an iterative method which will recover the metric from @xmath46 down to zero ( in the non - singular case ) .",
    "the naive way in which to now proceed is by taking a slightly smaller choice of minimum radius , @xmath54 , and splitting up the relevant integrals in and into two pieces , one from @xmath55 to @xmath46 and one from @xmath46 to @xmath42 .",
    "these integrals could then both be well approximated , the first by taking a series expansion about the minimum radius @xmath55 , and the second by approximating the spacetime as pure ads , as in .",
    "we would thus end up with two simultaneous equations which could be solved to give @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and could then proceed in a similar fashion to obtain the the entire bulk metric , to an arbitrary level of accuracy determined by our choice of step size in @xmath1 ( which is determined by our choice of boundary region @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , it turns out there is a significant problem with this setup which prevents it being applied in practice .",
    "specifically , the iterative process is unstable , with any errors in the estimates for @xmath58 and @xmath59 leading to greater errors at the next step .",
    "this results in a rapid divergence of the estimate from the actual metric , and the iteration quickly breaks down .",
    "whilst improving the approximations to the various terms in the integral can slightly improve matters , there is a way of avoiding this unstable setup ( where we solve for the two unknowns simultaneously at each step ) entirely , as we shall now demonstrate .",
    "consider the equations and above ; they both have very similar forms , and there is in fact a strikingly simple yet powerful relation between the two quantities , @xmath60 and @xmath52 .",
    "taking the derivative of both with respect to @xmath9 , the angular momentum , we have that :    @xmath61    and @xmath62 using the fact that @xmath63 , and noting that the divergent part of the integral cancels with the divergent second term in each equation , we can see that the two equations are identical upto a factor of @xmath9 , and we therefore have that :    @xmath64    which can be rewritten as    @xmath65    thus we have the remarkable fact that the minimum radius gives the final angular momentum of the geodesic , but as this will not be conserved , it is not necessarily equal to @xmath40 .",
    "] of the static spacelike connecting any two points on the boundary is immediately calculable from the gradient of a plot of the proper length , @xmath60 versus angular separation @xmath52 , see figure [ lvsphi ] .",
    "this immediately provides us with one of the two unknowns we need at each step , and leaves us with only needing to calculate @xmath66 .",
    "this can be done iteratively , beginning at large @xmath1 , by splitting up ( or ) and taking various approximations to each part of the integral , the full details of which are given in appendix a. unlike the original proposal for the method , this is very robust to any errors , and provides an efficient way of determining the bulk structure , as we see in the examples in the following section .",
    "the relation also allows us to more specifically determine the point at which the metric deviates from pure ads ; recall that on the first step of the iteration ( with @xmath67 ) , we took the metric to be pure ads , and after determining @xmath46 using , set @xmath68 , where we originally stated that @xmath46 could be taken arbitrarily large .",
    "we can now explicitly check the radii at which the pure ads assumption holds , as we can now determine the value of @xmath40 corresponding to each @xmath52 separation of the endpoints , and hence plot @xmath58 vs @xmath69 for each @xmath70 . in pure ads , we know that the relation is given analytically by @xmath71 , and at small enough angular separation , the two plots should coincide ( this is also of course true on the plot of @xmath60 vs @xmath52 , see figure [ lvsphi ] ) .",
    "this allows one to avoid beginning the iteration at an excessively large radius , which would reduce the efficiency of the extraction .    , vs the angular separation of the endpoints , @xmath52 , for static spacelike geodesics in an asymptotically ads spacetime ( red , lower curve ) , and in pure ads ( black , upper curve ) .",
    "the gradient , @xmath72 at each point provides the angular momentum , @xmath9 , for the corresponding geodesic .",
    "when the angular separation is small , the geodesics remain far from the centre , away from the deformation , and hence both curves coincide.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "+    we now address the issue of how confident one can be that the extracted solution matches the actual metric , before going on to consider some examples .",
    "a natural question to ask at this point is on the uniqueness of the solution , i.e. is there more than one possible @xmath35 which gives the same boundary data for the geodesics ?",
    "then if there is a unique @xmath35 , does this proposal for reconstructing the metric always find it , and not some alternative set of points @xmath73 which also solve equations and without being the actual metric function ?    considering the second question , it is quite simple to show that if the metric function @xmath35 corresponding to the boundary data is unique , then the iterative method must recover it ( up to a level of accuracy determined by the number of steps ) .",
    "we will show that if this is not the case , then either the metric function was not unique , contradicting our assumption , or the estimate does not in fact correspond properly to the boundary data .",
    "take the extracted points @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and use them to construct an interpolation function , which is then our estimate for the metric function .",
    "we can then use this estimate to compute the proper length and angular separation of all spacelike geodesics passing through the spacetime .",
    "if the generated data matches with the original data from the field theory , we have successfully produced an estimate for an actual bulk metric , and by our assumption of uniqueness , this function must be @xmath35 .",
    "if the generated data fails to match correctly to that from the field theory , we can deduce that we havent in fact produced an estimate for @xmath35 , but instead that our @xmath73 are simply a set of points which solve the equations and .",
    "in this case , the iterative step size used to produce the estimate was too large , and the extraction procedure should be repeated with a smaller step size .",
    "once the new estimate has been produced , the above test can again be applied ; this can continue until an actual estimate of @xmath35 is recovered .",
    "finally , one should note that at an infinitesimally small step size , one will use the complete , where @xmath46 can be taken arbitrarily large ] set of spacelike geodesics to probe the spacetime , generating a continuous estimate for @xmath35 from @xmath46 down to zero .",
    "as such the data generated from our estimate must correspond to that from the field theory , as it was all used in its production .",
    "thus , by uniqueness , the estimate must correspond to @xmath35 .",
    "a basic argument for the uniqueness of the bulk metric corresponding to the field theory data ( in our case , the proper length of the static spacelike geodesics as a function of the angular separation of the endpoints ) follows from a comparison of the local degrees of freedom on each side , by noting that this data and the geometry of the constant time slice we wish to recreate contain the same amount of information , as @xmath35 is a function of the radial coordinate only .",
    "when coupled with the knowledge asymptotic behaviour of the spacetime ( that it approaches pure ads at large @xmath1 ) , we have the boundary conditions needed to ensure that the metric function is unique . in less symmetric cases one has more freedom in the metric , but",
    "correspondingly one also has more information with which to determine this , see section [ sec : extension ] for further comments on these scenarios .",
    "finally , one should note that this is simple argument does not constitute in any way a proof of the existence or uniqueness of the solution , as here the focus is on demonstrating how an intriguing link between field theory and the bulk leads to a remarkably simple process for calculating numerically the corresponding bulk metric .",
    "with this in mind , having argued that with suitable checks the extracted solution should be an estimate for @xmath35 , we now proceed to some examples where we examine the accuracy of such estimates .",
    "to illustrate the procedure for metric extraction , we begin by considering some examples of deformations of the pure ads metric . in the cases considered",
    "we have taken the proper length and angular separation of the endpoints to be known from the relevant field theory , and taken a linear step size in @xmath9 ( and hence @xmath40 ) .",
    "the method of appendix a is then applied for a variety of step sizes , and the resulting estimates for @xmath35 are plotted alongside the actual curve .",
    "the three deviations from pure ads we consider are the following :    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    where each gives a non - singular , asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "these functions were chosen as tests of the extraction method because they provide clearly visible deviation from the pure ads metric of @xmath78 .",
    "the first example also corresponds to one used in @xcite in an alternative method for extracting the bulk information ( see section [ sec : compari ] ) , and despite the similarities between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we shall see a noticeable difference in the accuracy of their extraction for larger step sizes .    for the first example we use four choices of step size in @xmath1 , namely @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and compare the accuracy of the generated curves to the actual function ; this is done by considering best fits to the numerical estimates , obtained by using a non - linear fit to the following function :    @xmath83    to give values for the various parameters .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table11 ] , with the corresponding data points plotted in figures [ f1approx ] and [ f1approxb ] .",
    ".best fit values ( to 2 d.p . ) for the @xmath84 parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath13 , with the actual values indicated in brackets . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see quite clearly from the table of results that even using our roughest estimate for @xmath90 , namely @xmath91 , we obtain a highly accurate estimate for @xmath35 . indeed , the limiting factor is not the accuracy of the estimate for @xmath90 , rather it is the choice of step size and starting @xmath92 in the null geodesic part of the extraction ( see footnote [ foot1 ] ) .      as the two extraction methods give such good fits when applied sequentially , we now turn our attention to a less trivial example , where we consider a gas of radiation in @xmath2 .",
    "there have been numerous papers exploring this and other closely related geometries in various dimensions , such as @xcite , and we focus here purely on our ability to recover the metric information via our numerical extraction methods .",
    "firstly , we note that whilst restricting ourselves to three bulk dimensions does make our spacelike geodesic method fully applicable ( see section [ sec : dims ] ) , it also restricts the physical realism of the model due to the non - dynamical nature of gravity .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a good toy model for radiating `` stars '' in ads spacetimes , and allows us to demonstrate how well the pertinent information ( e.g. the `` star s '' mass and density profiles ) about the bulk can be recovered .",

    ", along with plots of the corresponding metric functions @xmath35 and @xmath90 ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    before we begin with the metric extraction , we should make a comment about the features of such spacetime at large radius , as there are significant differences in the asymptotic behaviour of the metric depending on the choice of @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath110 , we have that the asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions is given by    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is a constant .",
    "if @xmath113 we have that the metric becomes the btz black hole solution at large @xmath1 ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) for more details ) ; this poses a problem for the method involving null geodesics , as we can no longer use them to probe the full range of @xmath1 . whilst this is due to the form of the effective potential ( see figure [ starpotentials ] )",
    ", it is not due to the local maximum problem we saw in section [ sec : singspaces ] . rather here",
    "we no longer have geodesics which can usefully probe the spacetime _",
    "away _ from the centre : for the full set of null geodesics ( obtained by varying @xmath92 for zero to one ) , the minimum radius reached by the geodesics is bounded from above .",
    "we thus can not take @xmath40 to be arbitrarily large on the first step of our iteration , which was necessary for us to begin extracting the metric ( although we should note that we could still apply the spacelike method to extract @xmath90 in this scenario ) . instead however , we will consider the region @xmath114 , corresponding to conical defects , in which both methods are applicable and is obtained by taking @xmath108 to be small . at large @xmath1 .",

    "this is where we recall that we should be assuming that _ a priori _ we knew nothing about the origin of the metric s deviation from pure ads .",
    "in fact , this has not been the case . whilst our expressions for @xmath90 in terms of @xmath103 and the mass @xmath103 in terms of the density @xmath100 , and , stem from the dimensionality of the bulk ( e.g. in higher dimensions one would have the @xmath103 term multiplied by some negative power of @xmath1 ) , in defining @xmath35 by we",
    "have already taken the matter content to be a gas of radiation , which sets @xmath133 and removes the pressure profile as an unknown .",

    "this is simply because includes @xmath128 terms , and the non - linear step size in @xmath1 in the null extraction method generates a greater amount of data points at low @xmath1 for the estimate for @xmath35 , thus allowing the derivative of the interpolation function to be more accurately determined .",
    "we can obtain the best fit at low @xmath1 by using @xmath128 in and solving for @xmath100 ( see figure [ star5 ] ) , where we have avoided using derivatives . to be determined from the fall off of @xmath100 at large @xmath1 ; this is however available from our earlier fit to @xmath138 given in .",
    "]    finally , we can use the estimates to give a numerical value for our free parameter @xmath108 . taking @xmath99",
    "as having been calculated from the asymptotic fall off , and approximating the value of @xmath139 as @xmath140 , we obtain a value of @xmath141 , compared with the actual value of @xmath142 . whilst the match is fairly good ,",
    "this is where the accuracy of the estimates for @xmath35 and @xmath90 become very important ; in taking @xmath143 we have discarded the final few iterations of @xmath128 at small @xmath1 , which lead to a kink in the curve , as being erroneous and due to an incomplete recovery of @xmath90 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption to make , as in our previous examples we saw that for too large a step size the method of generating @xmath126 fails to reach down to @xmath144 .",
    "we also have the data from the higher step size fits ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) with which to analyse the accuracy of our estimates for @xmath90 at low @xmath1 .",
    "however , as it is the small @xmath1 region from which the numerical value of @xmath108 is calculated , in order for it to be confidently extracted one must ensure the estimates @xmath126 and @xmath128 are thoroughly checked for @xmath1 close to zero .",
    "in all of the above we have taken the spacetime metric to be both static and spherically symmetric , however , we now consider how the methods for extracting the bulk presented here could be extended to include more general cases .",
    "reducing the amount of symmetry removes conserved quantities from the geodesics ; spherical symmetry gives us conservation of angular momentum , time translational symmetry gives us energy conservation .",
    "consequently , there will be additional unknowns introduced in our analysis of the geodesic path , as we will need to know more details about its route through the bulk ; this should not prove a problem , however , as there will also be further information available from the geodesic equations .",
    "consider for example the non - spherically symmetric ( but still static ) case .",
    "before , when there was no angular dependence in the metric , we considered a series of geodesics which probed deeper and deeper into the bulk - in other words , we had one which probed down to each @xmath58 .",
    "these were specified by the angular separation of the endpoints on the boundary , and the actual values of the @xmath147 and @xmath148 were unimportant .",
    "this allowed us to reconstruct the bulk step by step , one value of @xmath59 at a time .",
    "now , what is the analogous method in the non - spherically symmetric case ? at each step of the iteration we can still consider some fixed angular separation of the endpoints , however , we must also vary @xmath147 from @xmath149 to @xmath150 ( with some choice of slicing sufficient to give an accurate estimate ) , such that for each iterative step we recover a `` ring '' of information about the metric .",
    "the subsequent steps then recover smaller and smaller rings , extracting the metric function down to the centre of the spacetime .",
    "this is the basic idea of the extraction method ; finalising a more detailed procedure which gives high accuracy within a reasonable computational time is subject of current research , one now has two step sizes to consider : the slicing in @xmath52 and the radial steps in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we should recall that higher dimensional cases offer further complications , as mentioned in section [ sec : dims ] , as although the null geodesic method is already applicable in such cases , the spacelike method is not . in principle",
    "though , the ideas still hold ; one would need an expression for the correct minimal surface corresponding to the entanglement entropy ( see @xcite for more details on this point ) which could then be treated in much the same way as the geodesic proper length , as they will each probe to a certain depth in the bulk , and those remaining at large @xmath1 will behave as in pure ads . completing the analysis for these cases is again the subject of further research .",
    "in this paper we have seen how the bulk geometry can be extracted ( in asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes ) using the entanglement entropy information obtained from the corresponding boundary field theory . in the three dimensional case ,",
    "the entanglement entropy of a subsection @xmath151 of the @xmath152 dimensional boundary is proportional to the proper length of the static spacelike geodesic connecting the endpoints of @xmath151 ( see figure [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "using this relation , , together with the endpoint data allows both the minimum radius , @xmath40 , of the spacelike geodesic and the value of the metric function @xmath66 at this point to be determined , provided sufficient information about the bulk is known for @xmath153 .",
    "thus by starting from large @xmath1 , where the metric is approximately pure ads , one can probe further and further into the bulk using geodesics connecting progressively smaller regions on the boundary .    this extraction of the metric is made significantly more straightforward by an interesting relationship between the proper length of the geodesic and the angular separation of its endpoints .",
    "specifically , the gradient , @xmath72 , gives the angular momentum , @xmath9 , of the corresponding geodesic , which in the static , spherically symmetric cases considered here , is equal to the minimum radius the geodesic probes down to in the bulk .",
    "an iterative method for recovering the metric information in practice by approximating the relevant geodesic equation was thus then proposed , and a number of examples were given . the iterative method was developed in analogous way to the method presented in @xcite , which used the endpoint data of null geodesics to similarly extract the bulk information , and was reviewed in section [ sec : review ] .",
    "a comparison of the two methods was then made , investigating their relative advantages and disadvantages ; this highlighted a number of differences in their relative applicabilities .",
    "whilst the method of @xcite , which uses null geodesics as probes , runs into problems when encountering geometries with significant deviation from pure ads ( as this leads to a non - monotonic effective potential for the geodesics which limits the depths to which the metric information can be recovered ) , no such limitations arise for the method given here involving spacelike geodesics , unless the metric is also singular . on the other hand ,",
    "the null geodesic method is completely applicable in any number of dimensions , whereas although the principle of extracting the metric via spacelike geodesics can be extended to greater than three bulk dimensions , the relation between entanglement entropy and minimal surface area no longer involves the geodesic s proper length , and thus this quantity is no longer so readily available from the cft .",
    "computationally , the two methods ( as presented here ) are of comparable efficiency , although both have scope for further optimization .",
    "significantly , we demonstrated in section [ sec : combo ] how the two methods can be applied together to allow the probing of the most general static , spherically symmetric asymptotically ads spacetimes , with metric of the form of .",
    "this is a notable extension to the applicability of either method individually , as whilst part of the metric information ( i.e. the @xmath90 of ) could always be extracted using the spacelike geodesics , they could never give any insight into @xmath35 .",
    "the null geodesics , on the other hand , can probe both @xmath35 and @xmath90 but without yielding enough information to determine either , without some _ a priori _ knowledge of a relationship between them .",
    "it is the separation of the two functions in the spacelike case , however , which allows the methods to be combined so straightforwardly , as one firstly determines an estimate for @xmath90 , then takes this as a known function when analyzing the null geodesic data .",
    "we concluded by considering the toy model scenario of a gas of radiation ( a `` star '' ) in @xmath2 and demonstrated how the recovery of the metric allowed the pertinent information of the star ( its mass and density profiles ) to be well estimated . whilst the estimates produced were accurate down to low @xmath1 ( dependent on the choice of step size in both the null and spacelike methods ) , one had to be careful when using the derivative of @xmath131 ( the interpolating fit to the mass profile ) to generate @xmath132 .",
    "although the fit produced was still good , it failed at noticeably larger @xmath1 than the fits for any of the other functions , due to inaccuracies introduced via @xmath154 .",
    "this could be avoided by using the alternative definition of @xmath100 in terms of @xmath35 , , provided one first extracted the asymptotic fall off of the density as @xmath155 .",
    "finally , we noted in section [ sec : extension ] that this work can be extended further by considering spacetimes which are not spherically symmetric , and by investigating the higher dimensional cases where the area of the minimal surface relating to the entanglement entropy is not simply the length of the corresponding static spacelike geodesic . both avenues",
    "have the prospect of yielding fruitful results for metric computation in ads / cft . also , one could approach the problem of metric extraction from a different angle , by investigating whether there are alternative methods available which do not involve the use of geodesic probes .",
    "if so , it would be interesting to see whether these lead to more efficient ways of computing the metric functions than those described here .",
    "for useful discussions and feedback i wish to thank veronika hubeny ( who also provided much encouragement and helpful information ) along with simon creek , martyn gigg , elizabeth holman , kemal ozeren and james umpleby .",
    "this work was supported by an epsrc studentship grant and the university of durham department of mathematical sciences .",
    "in section [ sec : method1 ] we outlined the principle behind the iterative technique of metric extraction : determining @xmath40 from the gradient @xmath0 and then calculating an estimate for @xmath66 at each step by splitting up the integral in and approximating each piece separately , beginning the whole process at large @xmath1 , where the metric is approximately pure ads and we can take @xmath47 . here",
    "we go on to give further details of how to set this up , and explicitly write down the equations used in the approximations .",
    "having taken the first step which chooses an @xmath46 large enough so the metric is approximately pure ads , and hence @xmath53 , we can continue as follows . for a geodesic with slightly lower angular momentum @xmath156 ( which can be obtained by taking a slightly larger region b on the boundary ) , we can split up the integral over @xmath1 in into two pieces : @xmath157    the first integral in the above",
    "can be well approximated by taking a next - to - lowest order series expansion about the point @xmath158 , as the distance @xmath159 is small .",
    "for the second integral , we can again use our assumption that @xmath160 for @xmath45 , and overall we obtain for the angular separation of the endpoints :    @xmath161    where we have again taken the limit @xmath162 .",
    "alternatively , one could perform similar approximations on the equation for the proper length , , to obtain :    @xmath163    in the above expressions we have introduced a further unknown , namely the gradient of the function @xmath35 at the point @xmath164 ; this can be eliminated by taking the simple linear approximation :    @xmath165    which holds provided the radial distance @xmath159 is kept small .",
    "term deserves further comment : one can avoid introducing it by using the lowest order expansion , however , this reduces the overall accuracy of the method .",
    "the detrimental effect of the approximation to the gradient on the accuracy of the estimates is not as pronounced as in the method of @xcite due to the use of linear step size in @xmath9 ( and hence @xmath1 ) , see section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "surprisingly , an alternative integral one might consider when setting up the iteration , which allows the higher order series expansion to be used without introducing @xmath166 , leads to an unstable method rather than a more accurate one , see appendix b. ] as we mentioned in section [ sec : entangle ] , we can calculate the proper length @xmath167 from the relevant entanglement entropy expression , in general this is given by :    @xmath168    where @xmath24 corresponds to the entanglement entropy for the subsystem a in the deformed spacetime . taking the entanglement entropy as a known quantity from the cft , along with the angular separation of the endpoints ( which is given simply from the length of the subsystem in the cft )",
    "one can calculate the corresponding minimum radius @xmath55 from , and so our only remaining unknown in both and is @xmath56 .",
    "we can thus numerically solve either for @xmath56 , and determine the metric function at this point .",
    "continuing in a similar fashion , by taking geodesics with progressively smaller angular momenta and numerically solving at each step , we can iteratively extract the complete metric . for general @xmath69 and @xmath115 the integrals",
    "are split up into @xmath169 pieces ; two are approximated as in and , with the remaining terms evaluated using simpson s rule ( a polynomial fit to the curve ) .",
    "the general expression for @xmath69 can then be written as :    @xmath170    where @xmath171 @xmath172 are the two approximations we had before , and the @xmath173 term is given by : @xmath174 for @xmath70 even term , which can be obtained in an identical way to that used in determining @xmath46 ] , and by @xmath176 for @xmath70 odd , where we have defined the function @xmath177 for ease of notation . for the proper length we similarly have that :    @xmath178    with @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 for @xmath70 even , and @xmath182 for @xmath70 odd , with the function @xmath183 defined by @xmath184    thus we can continue the metric extraction down to @xmath144 in the non - singular case , or down to @xmath185 in the black hole case ( see section [ sec : singspaces ] ) .",
    "in the method of the previous appendix , the series expansion we used to approximate part of the integral in both and introduced an extra term , @xmath166 , which we then chose to linearly approximate .",
    "what appears immediately obvious is that one could simply combine the two equations and avoid using any approximation to @xmath166 at all .",
    "considering the two terms @xmath186 and @xmath187 from and respectively , we see that :    @xmath188    and so by considering @xmath189 at each step we eliminate the @xmath190 term . for completeness , we note that this is equivalent to the formulating the integral as follows : beginning with expression and integrating over @xmath9 gives :    @xmath191    which can then be integrated by parts : @xmath192 and rewritten using the expression for @xmath52 from :    @xmath193    we can now reverse the order of integration , and as the function @xmath35 has no dependence on @xmath9 , integrate over @xmath9 . for",
    "some specific geodesic with proper length @xmath115 and angular separation @xmath69 on the boundary ( to continue with the notation from earlier ) we thus have that : @xmath194 where we have also used that @xmath41 and relabeled the minimum radius as @xmath58 . after splitting up the integral as in appendix a",
    ", the lowest order approximation to the integral at @xmath58 is given by , and one can then seemingly determine @xmath59 , the only unknown , for each @xmath70 from one to @xmath195 and hence reconstruct the entire metric function @xmath35 .    applying this in practice",
    ", however , one immediately runs into the same stability problems that occur in the naive approach mentioned in section [ sec : method1 ] , where one attempts to recover both @xmath40 and @xmath66 directly from equations and .",
    "the method appears inherently unstable to errors , and fails to generate any reliable estimate for @xmath35 at any step size .",
    "interestingly , an almost identical formalism can be carried out in the method involving null geodesics ( see appendix c ) , however , unlike in the spacelike case , this method is both stable and highly efficient .",
    "further analysis into what causes the stability / instability of the different methods is ongoing .    finally , to clarify one further point",
    ", we note that the original ( naive ) method of section [ sec : method1 ] can be stabilised by introducing a particular regularisation of the proper length , where one subtracts off the proper length of a corresponding geodesic in pure ads which probes down to the same depth , @xmath40 .",
    "although this appears to not introduce any new information , one should remember that we are working from the field theory data , and as such , one does not in fact know the proper length of this geodesic , but rather the one which has the same angular separation of the endpoints .",
    "thus using this regularisation is actually equivalent to determining the minimum radius from , using this to determine the length of the corresponding geodesic in pure ads , and then treating @xmath40 as an unknown again in and .",
    "this excessive over complication considerably reduces the efficiency of the method , as the equations are considerably more complicated to solve for ( even numerically ) at later steps .",
    "in section [ sec : combo ] we combine the extraction method presented here with that given in @xcite . ] to allow metric recovery in the most general static , spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "as the methods are applied sequentially , they require very little modification in order to work together , indeed the spacelike method is only affected by the change in notation when we introduce @xmath90 .",
    "the method involving null geodesics is altered slightly more however , and so is presented in full here .",
    "this explicit presentation also serves to highlight the similarities between the two iterative procedures for extracting the metric , which is remarkable given the different origins of the field theory data .    as mentioned in the review in section [ sec : review ] , we have a relationship between the gradient of the endpoints of the null geodesics ( see figure [ modnullfig1 ] ) and the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath18 , namely @xmath196 , which can be rewritten as :                thus taking the initial conditions to be @xmath201 , we can say that for any endpoint @xmath202 on the boundary we have : @xmath203 where we have renamed @xmath40 as @xmath204 . after using the spacelike geodesics to determine an estimate for @xmath90 , this",
    "then finally becomes : @xmath205 which , when coupled with the equation for the minimum @xmath1 ,      allows the metric function @xmath35 to be reconstructed from the plot of the endpoints , by applying a similar iterative method to that described in appendix a : for the general term @xmath58 , one approximates the integral from @xmath58 to @xmath207 by the parabolic area formula ; the integral from @xmath46 to @xmath17 by taking the spacetime to be pure ads ; and the remaining @xmath208 integrals by the trapezium rule , to obtain :          99 g.  t hooft , _",
