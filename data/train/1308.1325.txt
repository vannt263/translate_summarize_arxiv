    "the analysis of the non - linear stability of stationary black holes is , no doubt , one of the key open problems in contemporary mathematical general relativity . among stationary black hole spacetimes ,",
    "extremal ones are of particular interest .",
    "the simplest example of a extremal black hole is given by the so - called extremal reissner - nordstrm a static , spherically symmetric solution to the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the mainstream approach to the analysis of the non - linear stability of black holes has consisted , in a first instance , of the study of the linear evolution equations ( the wave equations or the maxwell equations ) on the black hole spacetime .",
    "this approach has also been pursued for the extremal reissner - nordstrm space time , and has provided valuable insights see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the conformal einstein field equations and the conformal methods based upon them have been used with remarkable success to understand the existence and stability of _ asymptotically simple spacetimes _",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a review . in view of this success ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether it is possible to adapt these ideas to analyse the stability of black hole spacetimes .",
    "one of the underlying strategies in this conformal approach is to obtain a detailed understanding of the geometric structure of the background solution under consideration in order to construct an evolution problem which is as simple as possible . in this respect",
    ", the conformal structure of the extremal reissner - nordstrm seems particularly amenable to a detailed analysis .    in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the domain of outer communication of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime can be covered by a non - intersecting congruence of curves with special conformal properties ( the so - called _ conformal curves _ ) .",
    "these curves are of special interest as they provide a simple expression for a conformal factor which , in turn , could be used to obtain a conformal representation of the spacetime . moreover , these curves can be used as the cornerstone of a gauge for the conformal evolution equations .",
    "these ideas have been used in @xcite to obtain global numerical evaluations of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "one of the insights obtained from the analysis of @xcite is the special role played in the conformal geometry by the points @xmath0 corresponding , respectively , to future and past timelike infinity .",
    "recall that timelike geodesics which are not crossing the horizon start at @xmath1 and end at @xmath2 .",
    "although the analysis of the conformal curves does not allow to conclude whether these points are regular points of the conformal geometry , it nevertheless shows that the extremal reissner - nordstrm is , in a particular sense , more regular at these points than , say , the schwarzschild black hole or a non - extremal reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "this statement is justified by the following observation : in the case of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution , the conformal curves constructed in @xcite which are passing through @xmath0 remain always timelike , while in the non - extremal case the curves become null at @xmath0 . in view of the conformal properties of the conformal curves in the non - extremal case",
    ", this degeneracy in their causal character indicates a degeneracy of the conformal structure see also the discusion in @xcite .",
    "a property of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution is that is possesses a conformal discrete isometry which , roughly speaking , maps the domain of outer communication into itself via an inversion of the radial coordinate and the horizon into null infinity see @xcite .",
    "moreover , this conformal inversion maps the black hole region of the extremal reissner - nordstrm to the _ negative mass _ extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime , and viceversa .",
    "a similar property is also present in the extremal reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetime see @xcite .",
    "initially this conformal isometry was viewed as a mere curiosity , but recently it has been used in @xcite to put in correspondence a class of conserved quantities on the horizon observed in @xcite with the so - called newman - penrose constants defined at null infinity see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to exploit the discrete conformal isometry of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime to obtain a representation of timelike infinity for which the conformal field equations and their associated initial data are regular . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that a conformal representation with these properties can be obtained for the spatial infinity of a vacuum spacetime with time - reflection symmetry the so - called _ cylinder at spatial infinity _ @xmath3 .",
    "in this article , it is shown that a similar construction can be implemented for the spatial infinity of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime the analysis being independent of the sign of the mass . by applying the conformal inversion to this construction",
    "we obtain the _ cylinder at timelike infinity _",
    "@xmath4 , a representation of the neighbourhood of the point @xmath2 for which the conformal field equations and their data are regular .",
    "remarkably , this strategy can also be used to obtain a similar representation of a neighbourhood of the cylindrical end @xmath5 of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime the _ cylinder at the singularity _",
    "we call these constructions collectively the _ cylinders at the horizon _ @xmath7 .",
    "the cylinders at the horizon inherit , in a natural manner , many of the properties of the cylinder at spatial infinity .",
    "crucially , they are _ total characteristics _ of the evolution equations implied by the conformal field equations that is , the evolution equations completely reduce to an interior system of transport equations . as a consequence",
    ", no boundary conditions can be specified at the cylinders .",
    "the solution to the evolution equations is fully determined by its value at some section of the cylinder . a further analogy between the cylinder @xmath7 at the horizon and the cylinder @xmath8 at spatial infinity is given by the following : the cylinders terminate in sets with the topology of @xmath9 where one observes a degeneracy of the symmetric hyperbolic evolution equations deduced from spinorial field equations whose principal part is of the form @xmath10 in the case of the the cylinder at spatial infinity",
    ", it has been possible to relate this degeneracy in the evolutions equations with the appearance of potential _ obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity _",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that similar obstructions will arise from the analysis of transport equations at the cylinders at the horizon .",
    "this question and its potential implications for the analysis of non - linear perturbations of the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime will be analysed elsewhere .",
    "there is , however , a crucial difference between the cylinder @xmath8 at spatial infinity and the cylinder @xmath7 at the horizon .",
    "while the conformal factor associated to the former representation vanishes at @xmath3 , in the later representations the respective conformal factors do not vanish at @xmath7 .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the cylinders at the horizon are not part of the conformal boundary .",
    "a natural question to be asked at this point is how crucial is the conformal isometry of the extremal reissner - nordstrm in the construction presented in this article . while it is of great value in order to gain intuition about the underlying structures , we claim it is not essential .",
    "once the key aspects of the construction have been identified , the results of this paper could have been obtained without using this isometry at the expense of lengthier arguments . this claim suggests the possibility of performing a similar analysis in other extremal black hole spacetimes , in particular the _ extremal kerr solution_.      in section [ section : basicexpressions ] we provide a summary of some basic facts concerning the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime ( various types of coordinates , penrose diagrams , properties of the conformal isometry ) which will be used throughout this article . section [ section : conformalgeodesics ] discusses the basic properties of conformal geodesics in electrovacuum spacetimes which will be used in our analysis .",
    "section [ section : timesymmetricslices ] provides an analysis of the conformal properties of time symmetric hypersurfaces in the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime and the initial data for the conformal einstein field equations .",
    "this analysis is key to identify the singular behaviour of various conformal fields at timelike infinity and the cylindrical asymptotic end .",
    "section [ section : cylinderspatialinfinity ] discusses the construction of the cylinder at spatial infinity for the extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "this construction is used , in turn , in section [ section : cylindershorizon ] to motivate and implement the representation of the cylinders at the horizon .",
    "conclusions and possible implications of the present analysis to the propagation of fields close to timelike infinity and the cylindrical asymptotic end are discussed in section [ section : concludingremarks ] .",
    "finally , an appendix provides some details about the transformation formulae relating objects in the cylinders at spatial infinity and at the horizon .",
