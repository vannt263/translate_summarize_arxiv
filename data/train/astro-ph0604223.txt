    "the  twilight zone \" of structure formation , when the first galaxies and quasars formed and eventually reionized the universe , is the last frontier of galaxy formation studies .",
    "observations are now beginning to probe this epoch , through both direct observations of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and indirect constraints on reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the chief lesson of these initial forays has been how little we know about the first luminous sources , their formation processes , their feedback on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and reionization itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus a great deal of attention is now focused on developing new approaches to observing the @xmath3 universe .",
    "perhaps the most exciting is the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen ( see @xcite and references therein ) . of the many applications of this transition , the most popular possibility is to perform  21 cm tomography \" of the igm by mapping the redshift - space fluctuations in its brightness temperature @xcite . by measuring the entire history of reionization , as well as its spatial structure",
    ", such observations could provide extraordinarily powerful constraints on reionization and early structure formation .",
    "unfortunately , this technique also suffers from three intrinsic difficulties .",
    "first , it requires the spin temperature of the igm , @xmath1 , to differ from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise , the two blend together and can not be differentiated .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is not necessarily satisfied in the earliest phases of structure formation .",
    "second , given realistic telescope parameters , tomography can not resolve structures smaller than @xmath5 , which is well above the size of collapsed ( or collapsing ) structures at @xmath6 .",
    "it therefore does not probe structure formation across all scales .",
    "finally , tomography presents a number of truly formidable observational challenges , such as foreground contamination , ionospheric distortions , and terrestrial interference .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider a complementary probe immune to most of these problems : the  21 cm forest \" @xcite .",
    "the technique is the exact analog of the ly@xmath7 forest that is so useful for studying the igm at @xmath8 .",
    "neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to a distant radio - loud quasar resonantly absorbs continuum radiation that redshifts into the local 21 cm transition .",
    "thus a high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectrum can map the fluctuating neutral hydrogen field along this line of sight .",
    "interestingly , the 21 cm forest has a surprisingly long history : @xcite attempted to observe it toward cygnus a several years before the ly@xmath7 forest was even discovered ( in the process , he ruled out an @xmath9 universe full of neutral hydrogen ) .",
    "the 21 cm forest bypasses all of the difficulties with tomographic measurements .",
    "first , the cmb no longer acts as the background source , so the igm remains visible even if @xmath10 .",
    "second , the igm can be resolved spatially on fine scales ( tens of kpc ) given a sufficiently bright background source , allowing us to probe individual filaments and minihalos with square - kilometer class telescopes . finally , spectroscopy of bright point sources is relatively straightforward from an observer s perspective , and 21 cm forest observations are immune to many of the systematics that beset tomography .",
    "we expect to find four types of absorption features .",
    "first , the mean level of absorption measures the global evolution of the radiation background @xcite .",
    "second , sheets and filaments in the  proto - cosmic web \" produce stronger absorption features , just as they do in the ly@xmath7 forest : these features provide insight into the first phases of structure formation @xcite .",
    "third , a fair fraction of the igm gas may condense into  minihalos \" before reionization .",
    "these are virialized neutral clumps that are too small to fragment and form stars but may have important implications for reionization @xcite .",
    "no other method has been devised to detect them directly , but they produce relatively strong 21 cm absorption @xcite .",
    "finally , hii regions produce transmission gaps in the absorption spectrum ; their evolution would obviously constrain the evolution of the ionizing background as well as its spatial structure . while the first three of these classes have been considered before , they have not been examined in the context of self - consistent histories of the 21 cm background .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to re - examine each kind of absorber in light of this broader context .",
    "we will examine the features each imprints on the 21 cm forest , the epochs at which they are important , and their observable implications .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe some basic properties of the 21 cm transition in  [ 21 cm ] .",
    "we then discuss each of the four types of spectral features in turn : the mean level in  [ global ] , hii regions in  [ htwo ] , the cosmic web in  [ web ] , and minihalos in  [ minihalo ] .",
    "we conclude and discuss potential observations in  [ disc ] .    in our numerical calculations , we assume a cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , consistent with the most recent measurements @xcite , although we have increased @xmath18 from the best - fit _ wmap _ value to improve agreement with weak lensing .",
    "we quote all distances in comoving units , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we review the relevant characteristics of the 21 cm transition here ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a more comprehensive discussion .",
    "the 21 cm optical depth of a patch of the igm is @xcite @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left [ \\frac{h(z)/(1+z)}{{{\\rm d}}v_\\parallel/{{\\rm d}}r_\\parallel } \\right ] , \\label{eq : tauforest}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the neutral fraction , @xmath21 is the fractional overdensity , @xmath4 is the cmb temperature at redshift @xmath22 , @xmath1 is the spin temperature , and @xmath23 is the line of sight velocity in physical units . the brightness temperature of the patch viewed against a source of brightness temperature @xmath24 is ( neglecting peculiar velocities for simplicity ) @xmath25 note that @xmath26 for @xmath27 , the regime relevant for this paper . thus the igm temperature is crucial to estimating the signal strength .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tauforest ] ) applies only to the expanding igm , because it uses the expansion rate to determine the total column . for a single isolated cloud , the central optical depth is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the kinetic temperature , @xmath30 is the total column density of neutral hydrogen , and we have assumed pure thermal broadening .",
    "thus , clouds must have column densities close to those of damped - ly@xmath7 absorbers in order to cause substantial 21 cm absorption .    the spin temperature @xmath1 is determined by a competition between three processes : atomic collisions , scattering of cmb photons , and scattering of ly@xmath7 photons @xcite . in equilibrium , @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the sum of the collisional coupling coefficients for h  h interactions @xcite and h - e@xmath33 collisions @xcite ; it is of course proportional to the local density .",
    "the middle term describes the wouthuysen - field effect , in which absorption and re - emission of ly@xmath7 photons mix the hyperfine states .",
    "the coupling coefficient is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a factor of order unity describing the detailed atomic physics of the scattering process @xcite and @xmath36 is the background flux at the ly@xmath7 frequency in units @xmath37 ; the wouthuysen - field effect becomes efficient when there are @xmath38@xmath39 photons per baryon near this frequency .",
    "it couples @xmath1 to an effective color temperature @xmath40 ; typically @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we use the numerical fits of @xcite for @xmath35 and @xmath40 .",
    "we will first consider the evolution of the mean optical depth with time , which is determined purely by the mean neutral fraction @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; note that we neglect fluctuations in these quantities here .",
    "these depend on the thermal history of the igm ( including adiabatic expansion , x - ray heating , and shocks ) , the ultraviolet ( uv ) background ( which determines the ly@xmath7 coupling and hence spin temperature ) , and the ionizing efficiency . unfortunately ,",
    "none of these factors are well - constrained at high redshifts . rather than attempt to make robust predictions , we will therefore content ourselves with examining a range of simple histories to develop some intuition about the qualitative features .",
    "we will use the simple model of @xcite to compute the optical depth history ; we refer the reader there for a detailed discussion of the various prescriptions . in brief , this model assumes that stars dominate the radiation background and sets the total star formation rate via the rate at which gas collapses onto galaxies , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the collapse fraction ( or the mass fraction in halos with virial temperatures @xmath46 ) .",
    "the ionizing efficiency is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath49 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath50 is the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon incorporated into stars , and @xmath51 is a normalization constant accounting for helium in the igm .",
    "the rate of x - ray heating is also assumed to be proportional to @xmath44 , with a fiducial proportionality constant fixed by the local relation between star formation rate and x - ray luminosity @xcite . we let @xmath52 measure the efficiency at high redshifts relative to this local value ( measured between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "we include a simple model for shock heating from @xcite that describes shocks in the high - redshift cosmic web reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the final element is the uv background responsible for the wouthuysen - field effect .",
    "we again assume that the emissivity is proportional to @xmath44 and use the ( low - metallicity ) population ii and ( very massive ) population iii ( henceforth pop ii and pop iii ) spectral fits of @xcite to estimate the efficiency with which these photons are produced .",
    "note that we properly incorporate higher lyman - series transitions @xcite .",
    "although there are obviously a number of free parameters in this model , the general features are easy to understand .",
    "the 21 cm background contains three major transitions : the points when @xmath29 first exceeds @xmath4 , when ly@xmath7 coupling becomes efficient , and when reionization occurs .",
    "because it affects all the backgrounds equally , @xmath48 simply shifts everything forward and backward in time .",
    "the x - ray efficiency @xmath52 only affects the kinetic temperature , while @xmath49 only affects @xmath55 .",
    "the stellar initial mass function  especially the choice between pop ii and very massive pop iii stellar populations  affects the ratio of ly@xmath7 photons to ionizing photons and moves the onset of ly@xmath7 coupling relative to reionization .",
    "because they are so much hotter , pop iii stars push this transition forward in time , compressing the features in the 21 cm background .",
    "figure  [ fig : taumean ] shows some results for single - population models ( without feedback ) . for pop ii stars ,",
    "we take @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( solid curves ) . for pop iii stars",
    ", we take @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath59 , @xmath62 , and @xmath59 ( long - dashed curves ) , for a somewhat smaller overall ionizing efficiency .",
    "we also show results for pop ii stars with a low x - ray heating efficiency @xmath63 ( dot - dashed curves ) and pop iii stars with a high x - ray efficiency @xmath64 ( short - dashed curves ) .",
    "panels _ a _ and _ b _ show @xmath43 and @xmath65 . with this normalization , reionization ends at @xmath66 .",
    "the most important point is that @xmath1 increases beyond @xmath4 well before reionization completes , although the transition does occur significantly later for pop iii stars .",
    "crucially , @xmath1 also saturates at a smaller value for these stars .",
    "panel _ c _ shows the average optical depth in neutral regions ( i.e. , the contrast between neutral absorbing regions and empty hii regions ) . panel _",
    "d _ shows the mean optical depth as a function of redshift ( i.e. , the optical depth averaged over long stretches of the spectrum , including both neutral and ionized regions ) . at sufficiently high redshifts ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 evolves slowly .",
    "once ly@xmath7 coupling becomes strong , @xmath68 increases somewhat because ( in all of these models ) x - ray heating kicks in somewhat later .",
    "however , it does not take long for x - ray heating to dominate the temperature . from this point",
    ", the optical depth decreases rapidly : for our fiducial pop ii parameters , @xmath69 almost before reionization begins .",
    "even though massive pop iii stars produce comparable kinetic temperatures , the igm optical depth remains about an order magnitude larger if they dominate .",
    "this is purely a function of the spin temperature ( and lack of ly@xmath7 photons ) , so it would also occur if quasars dominated the radiation background .",
    "thus the 21 cm forest may be a more powerful probe if pop iii stars , or some other hard source , dominate .",
    "note that emission against the cmb does not depend on @xmath1 so long as @xmath70 . thus comparing the mean levels of emission and absorption could help to identify the type of sources during reionization .",
    "in any case , figure  [ fig : taumean ] illustrates a crucial point about the 21 cm forest : observing high optical depth features requires sources that shine well before reionization . at @xmath71",
    ", @xmath68 can indeed be quite large ",
    "nearly @xmath72 in some models  but during reionization it is likely to be up to three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "unfortunately , this presents a quandary : radio sources are likely to be associated with ionizing sources , so they too will be extremely rare at such high redshifts .",
    "the 21 cm forest has the inherent difficult that the strongest absorption can only occur for the most distant sources , while it may be nearly unobservable for the most common sources during reionization .    of course ,",
    "feedback ( among other processes ) could easily cause more complicated histories .",
    "figure  [ fig : taumean - fb ] shows some examples .",
    "the solid and dot - dashed curves assume our pop ii parameters but include strong photoheating feedback @xcite , even though recent work suggests photoheating is actually less efficient @xcite . ]",
    "( with varying speeds ; see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "the long and short - dashed curves increase the effects of feedback by assuming that photoheating is accompanied by a simultaneous change in stellar population ; again we allow two different feedback speeds .",
    "the parameters for each population take our fiducial values , except that we set @xmath56 for pop iii stars in order to exaggerate the decline in ionizing efficiency . note that the long - dashed curve yields a short period in which recombinations dominate .",
    "this is unlikely to occur in reality @xcite , as we have stretched several parameters to achieve it ( raised the jeans mass in photoheated region to its maximal value , assumed unrealistically fast feedback , and conflated the transition between stellar populations with photoheating ) .",
    "but it helps to illustrate how such an era might affect the signal .",
    "the principal effect of feedback is to prolong reionization by @xmath73@xmath74 .",
    "one might then hope for a long period of strong contrast between neutral and ionized regions .",
    "but panel _",
    "c _ shows that the optical depth in neutral gas nevertheless falls to @xmath75 by @xmath76 in all cases .",
    "this is because x - ray heating , and ly@xmath7 coupling , establish themselves in the early stages of reionization , when feedback is irrelevant .",
    "thus for a fixed endpoint to reionization , feedback weakens the 21 cm forest by pushing the x - ray and ly@xmath7 coupling transitions farther back in time .",
    "again , the prospects are somewhat better if pop iii stars dominate the early stages .",
    "now that we have some idea of the optical depths involved , it is useful to estimate their observability . the minimum background source flux density required to detect an absorption feature with signal to noise s / n is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the effective area of the telescope , @xmath79 is the system temperature , @xmath80 is the bandwidth of each channel ( assumed to be narrower than the feature of interest ) , and @xmath81 is the total  on - source \" integration time .",
    "here we have assumed simultaneous observation of two orthogonal polarizations , which is normal for dipole antennae , and taken telescope parameters similar to those expected for the ska observing at @xmath82 ( see also @xcite ) . at these low frequencies ,",
    "@xmath79 is dominated by the galactic synchrotron background ; on a quiet portion of the sky , this is typically ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath83 as we shall see , observing any of the absorbers we will discuss requires rather luminous sources .",
    "for example , the @xmath82 equivalent of cygnus a would have @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "ionized bubbles create gaps in the absorption . in this section",
    ", we will estimate the abundance and sizes of such transmission gaps throughout reionization .",
    "@xcite implicitly included hii regions in their simulation of the 21 cm forest .",
    "however , their box was only @xmath85 across .",
    "recent analytic models @xcite and simulations @xcite have shown that ionized bubbles rapidly exceed this size , so much larger boxes  or analytic models  are required to sample the bubble distribution reliably .",
    "we will therefore use a simple analytic model for the bubble size distribution @xcite that provides a good match to simulations @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the distribution of ionized material is driven primarily by the strong clustering of ionizing sources .",
    "we will ignore recombinations ( or more precisely their spatial fluctuations , which appears to be a good assumption during the early and middle stages of reionization for which the 21 cm absorption signal is large ; @xcite ) . in that case , the mass that any galaxy can ionize is simply @xmath86 .",
    "thus , an isolated region is fully ionized if @xmath87 ; because the collapse fraction is itself a function of the large - scale density field , this condition can be used to specify the ionization field .",
    "@xcite showed that the comoving number density of ionized bubbles @xmath88 is then @xmath89 , \\label{eq : nbub}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are density thresholds from the condition on the collapse fraction , @xmath92 is the variance of the density field smoothed on mass @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the mean comoving matter density . equation ( [ eq : nbub ] ) can easily be generalized to allow the ionizing efficiency to vary with galaxy mass @xcite , so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the halo mass .",
    "as we increase the importance of massive galaxies , the bubbles grow larger , especially during the early phases of reionization .    with equation ( [ eq : nbub ] )",
    ", the number density of transmission gaps in a 21 cm forest spectrum is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the maximum impact parameter for a bubble of mass @xmath93 to have a spectral length ( in observer s units ) of @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the comoving line element . for reference , @xmath101 at @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig : htwo ] shows the resulting distribution ( transformed into differential form ) for a variety of ionized fractions at @xmath82 ( we have adjusted @xmath102 in each case so as to recover the desired @xmath103 ) . except at the smallest @xmath103 ,",
    "the distribution is fairly flat until it cuts off sharply at relatively large widths .",
    "this is because @xmath88 has a well - defined characteristic size @xmath104 , corresponding to the cutoff .",
    "narrower transmission features arise from a mixture of smaller bubbles and lines of sight that pass near the edges of bubbles with @xmath105 . because @xmath104 rapidly grows from a few tenths to a few tens of mpc @xcite , the transmission gaps are relatively large spectral features .",
    "this contrasts with a model in which galaxy hii regions remain isolated , which would have gaps at most a few tens of khz wide : thus galaxy clustering is extremely important for the distribution of these bubble features ( and hence the 21 cm forest provides a sharp test ) .",
    "another key feature is that the total number density of distinct gaps remains roughly constant with @xmath103 ( at least until @xmath106 ) .",
    "this is because most new ionizations occur through the growth of existing bubbles ( which also merge with their neighbors ) rather than through the formation of new bubbles @xcite . as a result",
    ", the most obvious bubble fluctuations will actually occur relatively early in reionization , when bubbles do not carpet the spectrum .",
    "of course , the amplitude of the transmission feature is determined by the absorbing neutral gas surrounding the hii region ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : taumean]_c _ ) . for our fiducial pop ii stars , it drops from @xmath107 to @xmath108 over the range @xmath109@xmath110 .",
    "clearly , the contrast will be small even in the early phases of reionization .",
    "thus , by equation ( [ eq : forest - sens ] ) , observing hii regions would require a source of comparable luminosity to cygnus a. on the other hand , if massive pop iii stars dominate , the mean optical depth could be an order of magnitude larger ( see figure  [ fig : taumean]_c _ ) . in this case ,",
    "mpc - scale hii regions could be observed against mjy radio sources , which may be reasonably common at @xmath111 ( see  [ disc ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : htwo - wgt ] shows how the size distribution changes with the parameters of the ionizing sources .",
    "the thick curves show an identical model to figure  [ fig : htwo ] , except at @xmath112 .",
    "the thin curves assume that @xmath113 : thus massive galaxies shift the hii regions to larger scales @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in the spectrum by moving the radial cutoff to slightly larger frequency widths ; the effect is largest at small @xmath103 , where the bubbles will be easiest to observe .",
    "obviously the range of @xmath114 is relatively small in these models , but measurements will still help to constrain more complicated models ( including feedback , for example ) to test the basic premises of the @xcite model , and to measure @xmath115 .    finally , a comparison of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 curves in figures  [ fig : htwo ] and [ fig : htwo - wgt ] shows that the size distribution of hii regions at a given ionized fraction does not depend strongly on redshift .",
    "the shapes are nearly identical ; the normalization changes primarily through the line element @xmath100 .",
    "a third type of feature is the exact analog of the ly@xmath7 forest : the fluctuating absorption from sheets and filaments beginning to condense out of the igm .",
    "these can appear as narrow @xmath118 absorption spikes in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "naively , one might expect that these features would strengthen with time as the cosmic web accumulates more mass through ongoing structure formation .",
    "however , as usual we must also consider the broader context of the radiation backgrounds .",
    "these increase @xmath1 everywhere and hence _ decrease _ the strength of absorption even inside sheets and filaments .",
    "for example , in the simulations examined by @xcite , the number density of absorbers with @xmath119 actually decreased from @xmath120 to @xmath121 over the range @xmath82@xmath122 .    to study this problem in a more general context , we follow @xcite and consider a cloud with characteristic hydrogen density @xmath123 that is in ( or near ) hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "in such a cloud , @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the gas pressure , @xmath126 is the sound speed , and @xmath127 is the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath128 .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium thus sets a characteristic  jeans length \" @xmath129 for the cloud through @xmath130 , which describes the typical comoving length scale over which the cloud achieves a given overdensity , @xmath131 despite its obvious approximations and shortcomings , this simple model does a surprisingly good job describing the ly@xmath7 forest at @xmath132 , which is composed of the same sheets and filaments as the 21 cm forest @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect it to provide a reasonable description of high - redshift features as well .",
    "the column density of the cloud is then @xmath133 , and we can compute its optical depth via equation ( [ eq : taucloud ] ) . assuming pure thermal broadening ( additional sources can only decrease the peak @xmath0 ) and @xmath134 ( valid at high densities and/or for a substantial soft - uv background ) , we find that the mean overdensity corresponding to a feature of optical depth @xmath0 is @xmath135 overdensities @xmath136 only occur in virialized objects . from figs .  [",
    "fig : taumean]_a _ and [ fig : taumean - fb]_a _ , we see that in most cases @xmath137 long before reionization enters its rapid phase , even if x - ray heating is relatively weak . clearly , in these sorts of models cosmic web absorption features will be extremely rare during reionization .",
    "feedback only makes the prospects worse by pushing heating even further back in time relative to the end of reionization .",
    "recall that @xcite found significant absorption even at @xmath138 , which may appear to disagree with our claims .",
    "this is because their simulation ignored x - ray heating so had @xmath139 throughout much of the igm at @xmath82 .",
    "our models show that x - rays can easily surpass this threshold by @xmath140@xmath141 . on the other hand",
    ", they had @xmath142 everywhere by @xmath143  and indeed the number density of absorbers fell by a factor of ten over that time interval .",
    "so our principal conclusion , that @xmath1 must remain small in order for sheets and filaments to be visible , agrees with their simulation .",
    "this just illustrates the crucial importance of considering the signal in the broadest possible context .",
    "a final set of features come from minihalos .",
    "these gas clouds can have extremely large column densities and hence produce relatively strong absorption .",
    "@xcite computed the absorption profiles of minihalos and their abundance for a particular thermal history ( based on the simulation of @xcite ) . as above , our goal here is simply to consider the signal in more general models .",
    "we assume that minihalos form with a comoving number density @xmath144 given by the @xcite mass function ( using the @xcite mass function affects our results by @xmath145 ) .",
    "we assume that the gas settles into an isothermal distribution ( at the virial temperature ) inside the dark matter potential , which follows the @xcite distribution .",
    "other gas profiles will modify the absorption statistics , though not dramatically .",
    "the excess optical depth along a line of sight with impact parameter @xmath7 through a minihalo is @xcite @xmath146 , \\label{eq : mhtau}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the doppler parameter , @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the frequency at the minihalo ( without the cosmological redshifting to the observer ) , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is measured in physical kiloparsecs . here",
    "we have neglected the infall region around each minihalo , which can add a significant amount of absorption @xcite but is difficult to model accurately .",
    "note that , because the density varies with radius , @xmath154 even though the gas is isothermal .",
    "the peak optical depth can be large  tens of percent  though lines of sight with @xmath155 usually have @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the typical line widths ( resulting from thermal broadening ) are @xmath157 .    as with filaments",
    ", the uv background will affect @xmath1 inside minihalos .",
    "however , in this case it has only a modest effect because the local densities and temperatures are large , so that @xmath158 is a reasonable approximation everywhere . nevertheless , even if @xmath159 everywhere , the minihalo optical depth greatly exceeds that of the igm , because of their high column densities .",
    "in such a situation , the only difference is that equation ( [ eq : mhtau ] ) then measures the excess optical depth over the baseline igm level ( at least to zeroth order ) .",
    "this marks an important contrast with attempts to study minihalo emission @xcite : even when igm emission overwhelms minihalos @xcite , they are still distinguishable in absorption through their large columns .",
    "the abundance of minihalo features is then @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the maximum impact parameter ( in comoving units ) to have an optical depth greater than @xmath162 .",
    "the maximum minihalo mass @xmath163 is assumed to have @xmath164 , where atomic line cooling becomes efficient and stars can form ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum mass is more problematic .",
    "the jeans mass obviously increases as x - rays ( or other processes ) heat the igm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the quantitative effects of thermal feedback remain controversial .",
    "@xcite argued that x - rays produce an  entropy floor \" that efficiently suppresses accretion onto minihalos , and they showed that 21 cm absorption becomes much weaker in such a scenario .",
    "however , if the energy is injected after the gas has already achieved relatively high densities , x - ray heating may actually have only a modest effect on minihalo formation .",
    "perhaps the most interesting implication of minihalo measurements will be to constrain this feedback , so we will consider a range of efficiencies .",
    "for the sake of transparency , we simply assign the minimum mass by the jeans mass corresponding to a particular igm temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : forest - mh ] shows the number density of minihalo absorbers at @xmath82 and @xmath165 ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) . at each redshift",
    ", the top curves assume @xmath166 ( the temperature in the absence of structure formation processes , computed from recfast ; @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining curves take @xmath167 and @xmath168 , from top to bottom within each set . in a cold igm",
    ", the number of minihalo features is large ( with @xmath169 absorbers per unit redshift in this @xmath0 range at @xmath82 ) and they can be rather strong ( with @xmath170 @xmath171 absorbers per unit redshift ) .",
    "there are about an order of magnitude fewer features at @xmath172 , simply because structure formation is so much less advanced at that time .",
    "but the number of absorbers decreases rapidly as @xmath29 increases , especially for large optical depths .",
    "this is because the smallest minihalos produce the strongest features : by equation ( [ eq : taucloud ] ) , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the mean overdensity in virialized objects @xcite .",
    "thus raising the igm temperature by even a small amount eliminates the strongest features . on the other hand ,",
    "massive minihalos produce the more common @xmath175 absorption features , so they remain even if thermal feedback is strong .",
    "the sensitivity of the ( strong ) minihalo features tells us that 21 cm absorption can indeed be used to quantify the efficiency of thermal feedback and thus to constrain models of early structure formation .",
    "if these objects continue to form throughout the reionization era , they may therefore present the best possibility for strong features in the 21 cm forest .",
    "we have calculated four kinds of  21 cm forest \" absorption signatures .",
    "first , we computed the evolution of the mean optical depth in a set of plausible histories of early structure formation .",
    "we found that the optical depth can be relatively large ( @xmath176 ) at sufficiently early epochs , but it begins to decline rapidly once x - ray heating and ly@xmath7 coupling both become efficient ( because @xmath177 ) . by the time reionization begins in earnest , @xmath107 if pop ii stars dominate the radiation background .",
    "the optical depth can be somewhat higher if very massive pop iii stars dominate , because they cause weaker ly@xmath7 coupling .",
    "thus the best bet for observing the 21 cm forest is well before reionization .",
    "hii regions may be the easiest features to observe , because they are relatively large ( @xmath178@xmath179 ) even in these early stages ( although the contrast with neutral gas may still be relatively small ) .",
    "their detection would allow us to measure the size distribution of ionized bubbles , a key quantity in understanding reionization .",
    "sheets and filaments in the cosmic web , as well as minihalos , produce strong but narrow ( @xmath180 ) features .",
    "the vast majority of cosmic web features most likely fade well before reionization , because only virial overdensities can produce strong absorption once @xmath137 .",
    "minihalos may persist longer , because they have much higher column densities .",
    "we expect that up to @xmath181 absorbers with @xmath182 may be visible per unit redshift at @xmath82 ( or @xmath183 at @xmath172 ) , and their abundance provides a sensitive measure of thermal feedback @xcite",
    ". they may also provide insight into the small - scale matter power spectrum , if the astrophysics can be separated @xcite .",
    "regardless , the 21 cm forest avoids the confusion between minihalos and the igm that plagues tomography measurements @xcite .    we have considered each of these absorber classes in isolation , but of course in reality they will be intermingled",
    ". sheets , filaments , and minihalos will fluctuate around the baseline absorption provided by the mean signal , while hii regions will appear as gaps ( although minihalos may still appear in such regions until they are photoevaporated ; @xcite ) .",
    "this will actually make the ionized bubbles easier to detect , because the gaps will be more obvious even if the mean level of absorption is small ( i.e. , both the mean level and variance of absorption will decrease in hii regions ) . on the other hand",
    ", it may be somewhat difficult to separate minihalo and cosmic web absorbers , because both produce narrow , strong lines .",
    "the 21 cm forest is a much simpler observation than large - scale 21 cm tomography , because we can essentially ignore all of the wide - field imaging and foreground problems that plague those observations .",
    "thus the feasibility of observing the 21 cm forest boils down to two issues : raw sensitivity and the existence of background sources .",
    "equation ( [ eq : forest - sens ] ) shows that the required source brightness is rather large . as a result",
    ", large collecting areas  comparable to the square kilometer array  are required for meaningful constraints .",
    "somewhat fainter objects can be used to detect fluctuations statistically ( for example , minihalos and the cosmic web provide an extra source of apparent noise ) ; however , such games will only buy a factor of few in source flux , so the limits are still relatively stringent @xcite .",
    "the most promising candidates for such bright objects ( @xmath184 ) are radio - loud quasars ; gamma - ray bursts and hypernovae most likely do not reach mjy fluxes @xcite .",
    "do bright radio - loud quasars exist at high redshifts ? assuming that their number density traces that of optical quasars , the sky could contain @xmath185 @xmath186 sources at @xmath187 @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "more detailed models , calibrated to the lower - redshift radio luminosity function , predict @xmath189 sources across the sky with @xmath190 at @xmath191 @xcite , although this prediction is quite sensitive to the assumed radio - loudness parameter .",
    "thus it appears quite reasonable to expect a fairly large number of appropriate lines of sight with @xmath192 .",
    "intriguingly , such bright sources could already have been detected in higher frequency surveys , such as first @xcite .",
    "the difficulty lies in separating them from the much more numerous low - redshift interlopers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , at extremely high redshifts ( @xmath193 ) we will likely be limited to just a few lines of sight .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate because our models show that high optical - depth regions most likely only exist at such epochs .",
    "x - ray heating and wouthuysen - field coupling generally precede reionization by a long time interval @xcite , decreasing the optical depth during reionization .",
    "thus the rapidly declining source density and the increasing intrinsic signal work against each other , which may ultimately limit the usefulness of the 21 cm forest . of course ,",
    "this is not coincidental : bright quasars are most likely associated with massive galaxies , which in turn must be rare until reionization gets underway .",
    "nevertheless , even a few high - redshift lines of sight would be true prizes , because they would allow us to observe the first phases of structure formation with unprecedented spatial resolution and to constrain the radiation backgrounds in the early universe . in this context , the recent downward revision of the _ wmap _ optical depth @xcite is certainly good news , because it suggests that heating and spin temperature coupling may have occurred at somewhat later times , and the requirements on background sources may be somewhat less stringent . given the many uncertainties about the @xmath194 universe , lower - redshift sources will also offer meaningful constraints ( for example , ruling out weak spin - temperature coupling from massive pop iii stars and testing feedback models for minihalos ) , even if the most plausible cases have considerably smaller signals ."
