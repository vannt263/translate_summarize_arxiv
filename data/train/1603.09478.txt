    "<S> this phenomenon is analogous to the destruction of a superfluid when its flow velocity is larger than the critical velocity . </S>",

    "<S> our main result is that the boost can have the counter - intuitive effect of _ strengthening _ the superconductivity ( in a sense that we explain later ) as opposed to weakening it like in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the boost eventually destroys superconductivity at a critical value but does so discontinuously when one of the fermi points of the system is boosted to zero momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a similar effect exists even for systems with quasi - long - ranged charge density wave order , i.e , the order is strengthened upon the application of a boost . </S>",
