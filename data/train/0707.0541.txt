    "the unidentified infrared ( uir ) bands are a family of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7@xmath0 m which are accompanied by several minor ones between 3 and 20@xmath0 m .",
    "they are believed to be due to c - h and c - c vibrational transitions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules or small particles and have been observed in planetary and reflection nebulae , hii regions , young stellar objects , the general interstellar medium and galaxies such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies , star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei .    given the ubiquity of the bands in both galactic sources and external galaxies and their widespread use as a probe of astronomical environments , improvement in understanding their origin is a high priority .",
    "for recent discussion of the uir bands see @xcite .",
    "considerable observational , theoretical and laboratory effort is being committed to pah research and to the chemistry and physics of disks and nebular material of objects such as the red rectangle , particularly as this holds the prospect of providing much insight into the rle of large molecules and dust in astronomy in general .",
    "it is notable that apart from the related monocyclic benzene molecule to which a narrow absorption line at 14.84  @xmath1 m in crl 618 has been assigned @xcite and blue fluorescence attributed to small pahs in the red rectangle @xcite , there is no spectroscopic identification of an individual pah in any astronomical environment .",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 m feature is the shortest wavelength member of the uir band family and is normally attributed to the c - h in - plane stretch vibration of pahs .",
    "most researchers consider that it arises from a superposition of infrared transitions of a number of gas - phase pah species following absorption of ultraviolet / visible photons , although this is not the only proposed form of pah material or proposed excitation mechanism .",
    "its profile has been explored in various objects @xcite and in some studies it is spatially resolved @xcite .",
    "these studies have suggested that there is no link between the local radiation field and the profile of the 3.3@xmath0 m feature , but rather that the variation observed arises from compositional changes related to the age of the emitting material @xcite .",
    "however , a clear picture for the material composition has not yet emerged and a coherent model remains to be established .    of all currently studied galactic objects",
    "the red rectangle is one of the most fascinating for uir band studies .",
    "it has a wealth of unidentified or partially identified emission features which fall in a wide spectral range from the near - ir to the far - uv @xcite .",
    "it is a particularly attractive target because of the strength of the uir bands and its well - defined biconical geometry that extends at least 40@xmath2 from the centre of the nebula @xcite .",
    "a new 3.28@xmath0 m sub - feature was suggested by @xcite in order to interpret the 3.3@xmath0 m band profile in the red rectangle .    in this paper",
    "we review briefly previous spectroscopic and imaging studies of the 3.3@xmath1 m emission feature ( section  2 ) , summarize observational aspects ( section  3 ) , and present a two - component analysis of long - slit cgs4 3.3@xmath0 m data for the red rectangle in section  4 with application also to iso sws 3.3@xmath1 m profiles of the orion bar ( section  5 ) .",
    "discussion and summary / conclusions are given in sections  6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the origin and nature of the 3.3@xmath0 m band has been discussed by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the profile is known to vary between and within objects and an ( * a , b * ) classification has been put forward by van diedenhoven et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with particular reference to iso sws data .",
    "the * a@xmath3 * group is common and has a profile described as ` symmetric ' with peak position at @xmath43.290@xmath0 m and a fwhm of 0.040@xmath0 m .",
    "this profile is found in widely differing objects ranging from orion bar h2s1 to ngc  7027 and is similar to type 1 ( @xmath5@xmath43.289@xmath0 m ; fwhm  @xmath6  0.042@xmath0 m ) in the earlier classification of @xcite .",
    "group * b1@xmath3 * with maximum at @xmath43.293@xmath0 m ( fwhm @xmath40.037@xmath0 m ) and group * b2@xmath3 * with a peak wavelength at @xmath43.297@xmath0 m ( fwhm @xmath40.037@xmath0 m ) are found in relatively few objects , an example of * b1@xmath3 * being orion bar  d2 .    the overall red rectangle spectrum is classified as * b2@xmath3 * where this comprises a 14@xmath2@xmath720@xmath2 exposure of both star and nebula . the 3.3@xmath0 m profile directly on the star hd  44179",
    "is fitted very well by a single lorentzian function ( song et al .",
    "2003 ) ; it is of the rarer type 2 in the @xcite description .",
    "hence the iso sws ( * b2@xmath3 * ) red rectangle spectrum is a superposition of type  2 and 1 where the latter persists in the nebula .",
    "song et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the development of a short - wavelength shoulder on the 3.3@xmath0 m feature with increasing offset from the central star could be interpreted in terms of the growth of a new band with a peak wavelength of 3.28@xmath0 m .",
    "this represents the evolution from a type  2 to type  1 ( * a@xmath3 * ) profile .",
    "we describe in this paper a refined analysis of the spatially resolved red rectangle data of @xcite which supports the existence of the proposed 3.28@xmath0 m band and establishes small blueward shifts in peak wavelength with offset for both components of the overall 3.3@xmath0 m feature .",
    "the same approach is applied to some iso sws targets in section 5 .",
    "we use the nominal description ` 3.3'@xmath0 m to refer to the whole 3.3@xmath0 m profile irrespective of shape , with the wavelengths of the components written with a second decimal place _ viz _",

    "4@xmath2 from the source at a spatial resolution of @xmath40.5 - 1@xmath2 . at a higher spatial resolution of @xmath40.2@xmath2",
    ", @xcite reported more detail in the 3.3@xmath0 m distribution and found elongation along the cone walls within 1 - 1.5@xmath2 of the star about the n - s axis .",
    "spectroscopic measurements by @xcite with a slit in four positions placed 5@xmath2 n , s , e and w of the star revealed 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission nearly symmetrically distributed around the star at these higher offsets .",
    "significantly there was no enhancement of 3.3@xmath0 m emission at the intersections of the slit with the bicone interfaces where the unidentified optical emission features peak in intensity .",
    "the distribution of the 3.3@xmath0 m feature contrasts sharply with images taken in other c - h mode uir bands .",
    "@xcite found that the 11.3@xmath0 m image shows a n - s bipolar shape with no central peak .",
    "similar images have been reported by @xcite for a 5@xmath2  @xmath7  5@xmath2 region at the c - h - related uir wavelengths of 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7@xmath0 m , but not for the continuum wavelengths of 10.0 and 20.2@xmath0 m which are centrally peaked . from these results",
    "it would appear that although the 3.3@xmath0 m feature is a pah transition , it does not originate in the same class of pahs that give rise to the c - h uir bands at longer wavelengths .",
    "a spatial distinction between 3.3@xmath0 m and other pah modes has also been found in ngc  1333 and the orion bar and attributed to differences in the size of the carriers , with the 3.3@xmath0 m band arising in smaller pahs @xcite .",
    "the technical details and a log of the near - ir long - slit observations have been presented by @xcite .",
    "as this paper describes a new analysis of these data , we summarize here that they were recorded using the 1 - 5@xmath0 m cgs4 spectrometer with a 1-pixel wide slit ( 0.6@xmath2)and a 256  @xmath7  256 insb array giving a resolving power of 1000 at 3.3@xmath0 m .",
    "spectra were taken with the 90@xmath2 long slit aligned along the nw ` whisker ' .",

    "the overall 3.3@xmath0 m band maximum shifts to shorter wavelength , increases in width and declines rapidly in intensity with offset from hd  44179 along the nw interface .",
    "this is summarized in table 1 where a single lorentzian fit to the 3.3@xmath0 m band was employed to illustrate these characteristics .",
    "however , the band shape in the nebula is _ asymmetric _ and varies as shown for offsets between 2@xmath2 and 10@xmath2 in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the evolution of the profile could be interpreted in terms of the emergence of a new 3.28@xmath0 m band which gave the overall appearance of a shoulder on the short - wavelength side .",
    "there is no evidence for a 3.28@xmath0 m component in the on - star spectrum which is symmetrical and very well fitted by a single lorentzian with peak maximum at 3.298@xmath0 m and fwhm  =  32 @xmath8 ( @xmath40.035@xmath0 m ) as shown in fig 1 . of @xcite . the 3.3@xmath0 m band in the nebula",
    "was previously analysed simply by taking the fit to the on - star spectrum and subtracting this from the recorded profiles at the various distances into the nebula . here",
    "we employ an improved approach in which the overall 3.3@xmath0 m band is fitted with two lorentzians , allowing the intensities , peak wavelengths and widths to float in the fitting procedure ( * splot * in iraf  which uses the levenberg - marquardt optimisation ) .",
    "the results of the new fitting for offsets between 2@xmath2 and 8@xmath2 along the nw axis are shown in fig .",
    "3 where the importance of the 3.28@xmath0 m contribution is seen to grow with offset .",
    "the 3.28@xmath0m/3.30@xmath0 m ratio grows approximately linearly with distance as shown in fig . 4 and suggests that at very high offset ( towards the ism ) the 3.28@xmath0 m feature would dominate .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of a 3.28@xmath0 m absorption feature towards the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "we consider possible origins of the 3.30 and 3.28@xmath0 m components in the next section .    the peak maxima of the two components from the fit shift to slightly shorter wavelength with distance from hd  44179 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the blueward shifts of the peak wavelength between 2@xmath2 and 8@xmath2 are @xmath42 @xmath8 and @xmath44 @xmath8 for the 3.30 and 3.28@xmath0 m components , respectively ( fig .",
    "the widths of the components appear to show some variation with offset ( see fig . 6 ) and , if confirmed , may be due to changes in the pah size distribution with offset . if the shift is caused by a reduction in internal temperature of the carriers and if the carriers are indeed gas - phase molecules , the direction of the shift is in the sense expected in comparison with experimental and theoretical data for gas - phase pahs @xcite .",
    "laboratory studies of the 3.3@xmath0 m _ absorption _ bands of naphthalene ( c@xmath9h@xmath10 ) , pyrene ( c@xmath11h@xmath9 ) , coronene ( c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) and ovalene ( c@xmath14h@xmath15 ) as a function of temperature show that the temperature - dependent frequency shift for these molecules increases with molecular size with values of _",
    "c. _ @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xmath8k@xmath20 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the largest of these laboratory coefficients suggests a carrier temperature reduction of only @xmath4100  k over 2 - 8@xmath2 . however , given that the infrared emission is thought to arise from rapid heating due to photon absorption rather than through thermal emission , this small temperature reduction is probably acceptable . the lower frequency shift with offset for the 3.30@xmath0 m component ( the one most prominent on - star ) suggests that this feature arises in smaller pahs than those that give rise to the 3.28@xmath0 m band which is ( relatively ) stronger in the nebula .",
    "the temperature dependence of the width of the laboratory 3.3@xmath0 m absorption feature on molecular size is less pronounced ranging from 0.0353  @xmath8k@xmath20 for naphthalene to 0.056  @xmath8k@xmath20 for ovalene @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the astrophysical observations .",
    "possible interpretations for the existence of two components are that these arise from different structural forms , sizes or hydrogenation / ionisation states of the ensemble of uir band emitters . laboratory gas - phase _ absorption _ spectra taken at elevated temperatures indicate that a blueward shift of the 3.3@xmath0 m peak maximum occurs with increasing pah size of _ c.",

    "m difference between the 3.30@xmath0 m and 3.28@xmath0 m features discussed here",
    ". a wider range of gas - phase data particularly for larger pahs would be of much interest .",
    "@xcite comment that the 3.3@xmath0 m feature is attributable to the smallest emitting pahs @xcite , and report that within the nasa ames laboratory sample of neutral pah spectra taken in an inert gas matrix the c - h stretch frequency distribution is _ bimodal _ with the bands of the smallest pahs centred near 3060 @xmath8 ( 3.27@xmath0 m ) and transitions of larger pahs occurring near @xmath43090 @xmath8 ( 3.24@xmath0 m ) . the origin of this bimodal distribution is not clear . applying a redward shift of @xmath40.03@xmath0 m to these laboratory data , as is commonly invoked on account of the higher carrier temperature in the nebula @xcite , yields wavelengths of 3.30@xmath0 m ( @xmath21 ) and 3.27@xmath0 m ( @xmath22 ) where @xmath23 is the number of carbon atoms .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the wavelengths of the two components deduced in the analysis of @xcite and considered further here .",
    "finally we note that although laboratory data show that the 3.3@xmath0 m stretch frequency varies with pah size and temperature , reported dft b3lyp/4 - 31 g c - h stretching frequencies are virtually independent of size being 3064 , 3064 and 3062  @xmath8 for c@xmath12h@xmath13 ( coronene ) , c@xmath24h@xmath25 ( circumcoronene ) and c@xmath26h@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "+      as for the 3.28@xmath0 m band , the 3.4@xmath0 m emission is not present on - star but grows in strength relative to the 3.3@xmath0 m band with offset .",
    "this emission almost certainly arises from c - h motion of side groups such as -ch@xmath27 and -ch@xmath28 or from doubly hydrogenated sites @xcite .",
    "figure 7 . shows a plot of the 3.4@xmath0m/3.3@xmath0 m band ratio as a function of offset where the values run from zero on - star to @xmath40.06 at 4 - 6@xmath2 ; the trend may be compared with that for the 3.28@xmath0 m feature ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this ( relative ) growth in strength of the 3.4  @xmath0 m band with offset is in the same sense as that found by @xcite who , using a 5@xmath2 aperture , determined a 3.4@xmath0m/3.3@xmath0 m ratio of 0.06 on - star ( which includes part of the nebula ) and 0.13 at a position 5@xmath2  n. it is striking that the 3.28@xmath0 m and 3.4@xmath0 m bands exhibit a very similar behaviour with increasing offset .",
    "we have also applied the two - component fitting approach to 3.3@xmath0 m iso data from @xcite for orion bar h2s1 and d2 ( see figure 8) , and for the red rectangle ( 14@xmath2@xmath7 20@xmath2 _ i.e. _ central star plus nebula ) . the iso 3.3@xmath0 m spectra for these objects together with the long - slit data for the red rectangle ( on - star and 3.8@xmath2 offset ) are shown in figure 9 . not only does the extent of the blue shoulder vary between objects , but the long - wavelength side of the feature also shifts slightly .",
    "the results of two - component fitting of the orion bar d2 and orion bar h2s1 data are shown in figures 10 and 11 and may be compared with the spatially resolved fits for the red rectangle in figure 3 .",
    "the spectral shape for orion bar d2 approximates to the higher offset region of the red rectangle , whereas the orion bar h2s1 profile is broader and symmetric ( class * a@xmath3 * ) .",

    "this implies that only in regions of relatively high extinction can smaller pahs survive as discussed by @xcite .",
