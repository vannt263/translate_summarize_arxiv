    "magnetic fields influence the thermodynamics of qcd , thereby adding an additional dimension to the phase diagram and presumably changing the phases of matter found in the latter . from a purely theoretical point of view , by tuning an external magnetic field and studying the reaction of qcd , one obtains important insights into the structure of strongly interacting matter , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields onto strongly interacting systems has been investigated in many approaches in the past years .",

    "_ magnetic catalysis _ describes the effect that a non - vanishing external magnetic field induces a dynamically generated fermion mass , even if the generic interaction strength of the fermionic theory is so small that the system is chirally symmetric otherwise .",

    "this is the underlying physical idea behind the recently proposed dual wilson loop @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we employ a functional approach to continuum qcd using dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) to study the influence of magnetic fields onto the quark propagation and the chiral condensate @xcite . while our long - term goal is to describe the phase diagram of qcd under influence of the magnetic field , in the following , we restrict ourselves to zero temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we start out with the quenched theory , using the full ritus eigenfunction formalism suitable for strong external fields . in this respect ,",
    "our study is complementary to ref .",
    "@xcite , where results for the limit of small fields have been discussed .",
    "we describe the corresponding formalism in some detail in section [ sec : quantummagneticfields ] and present results for the quenched theory in section [ res : quenched ] .",
    "we then provide the formalism for the treatment of the unquenched theory in section [ sec : unquenched ] and discuss results for the gluon and quark propagators , the condensate and the magnetic polarization of the vacuum in section [ res : unquenched ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ summary ] .",
    "there are different ways of treating a quantum field theory in an external @xmath1 field .",
    "one is to introduce sources to which the charged fields of the theory can couple .",
    "this makes particular sense if the abelian field is weak enough to be treated perturbatively and if it vanishes asymptotically .",
    "there are , however , interesting systems with strong magnetic fields like neutron stars or heavy ion collisions , where the effects of the magnetic fields must be included to all orders .",
    "furthermore , magnetically non - interacting asymptotic states can only be constructed in special cases , as for example for a field that covers only a finite volume .",
    "for very strong fields , one also has to take into account the breaking of poincar invariance , rendering the well known expansion in fourier modes in a perturbative attempt useless .",
    "the case of a strong external magnetic field is quasi classical and one can treat the interaction of the charges with the background abelian field statistically by solving the equations of motion .",
    "the resulting eigenfunctions can be used for expansions within the field theory one is interested in .",
    "the advantages of such a procedure are obvious : by transforming into the eigensystem of the particle in the background field , one obtains equations of motion which include the background field , but are formally equivalent to the one of a free particle , see eq .",
    "( [ dirac1 ] ) below .",
    "this leads to a set of new feynman rules that include the interaction with the external field to every order . in order to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we summarize this procedure in the following .",
    "one begins with the dirac equation of a fermion in an arbitrary external @xmath1-valued gauge field @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the covariant derivative with electric charge @xmath4 . without loss of generality",
    ", this charge can be set to one . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider @xmath5 corresponding to a constant magnetic field along the z - direction .",
    "it was shown by ritus @xcite that the fermion two - point green s function can only depend on four independent lorentz scalar structures @xmath6 with indices omitted that are being summed over .",
    "hereby , @xmath7 is the field strength tensor of the magnetic field , @xmath8 is its dual and @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "all the operators in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) commute with @xmath10 , thus one is left with solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath11 with the generic eigenvalue @xmath12 to be determined .",
    "other operators commuting with @xmath13 are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the eigenfunctions in 0 , 2- and 3-direction are still plane waves , whereas the 1-direction resembles a harmonic oscillator .",
    "there is still one further operator denoted by @xmath19 that has the same eigenfunctions as the ones in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the third pauli spin matrix given by @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 and the eigenfunctions @xmath23 are of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spin projector along the z - axis with the eigenvalues @xmath26 . with the above knowledge",
    ", the eigenfunctions can be written as @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is an unknown scalar function and @xmath29 a generic normalization .",
    "this ansatz can be plugged into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) and solved .",
    "an instructive derivation can be found in ref .",
    "one obtains @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the parabolic cylinder functions , which can be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials @xmath32 of order @xmath33 where the positive integer @xmath34 labels the landau level .",
    "furthermore , between the eigenvalues one finds the relation @xmath35 and realizes that @xmath36 are the eigenvalues of a harmonic oscillator with @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , @xmath34 is the total angular momentum quantum for each landau level , realized by two spin directions .",
    "except for the lowest eigenvalue ( the lowest landau level ) , every fermionic energy value is degenerate with respect to two spin orientations differing by @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the transition between two adjacent energy levels ( note that these are fermionic eigenstates ) is identical to a bosonic spin one transition of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "one can regroup the eigenvalues @xmath36 and @xmath39 and replace them by the quantum number @xmath40 in order to label states of different energy .",
    "this regrouping is shown exemplarily for the first few landau levels in the following table ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath41 can be replaced by @xmath42 , which has the dimension of momentum .",
    "the complete set of eigenvalues corresponding to the ritus eigenfunctions is @xmath43 or equivalently the `` pseudo - momenta '' @xmath44 .",
    "effectively , the magnetic field reduces the problem to 2 + 1 dimensions , breaking the euclidean @xmath45 symmetry to an @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 symmetry represents the gauge freedom , for one could have chosen a different vector potential giving the same magnetic field ( but a different definition of @xmath48 ) .",
    "for @xmath49 we have @xmath50 , so that the problem is in fact 1 + 1 dimensional on the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "it has been shown that the resulting ritus basis is orthonormal and complete @xcite , @xmath51 and @xmath52    let us further discuss the properties of an expansion in such eigenfunctions .",
    "first , by construction , the equations of motion for a fermion in the ritus basis are formally identical with that of a free particle .",
    "hence , they can be used to add a quantum theory , such as qcd , on top .",
    "the dirac propagator and the fermion self energy are diagonal in this basis , thus also the self energy @xmath53 satisfies an eigenvalue equation with eigenvalue @xmath54 @xmath55 there is , however , also a technical difficulty that comes with this method .",
    "since neutral particles such as photons and gluons still have plane waves as eigenfunctions , complications arise whenever they couple to charged particles .",
    "coupling particles that live in different eigenspaces renders the form of the vertex in ( pseudo-)momentum space complicated , as shall be seen below . as a result ,",
    "momentum conservation at those vertices is not what one is used to from covariant field theory . whereas physical momentum is not conserved , because of the loss of translational invariance caused by the external field , the pseudo - momentum ritus eigenvalues @xmath43 are conserved along every fermion line .    in the following section",
    ", we will derive the dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator in ritus functions .",
    "we will not be concerned too much with the distinction between momentum and pseudo - momentum , for particles will always be expanded in their eigenbasis and it should be clear from the context which eigenvalue is referred to .      in order to write down the quark dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) , we need to expand the fermion fields in terms of ritus eigenfunctions instead of the usual plane wave fourier representation as discussed above .",
    "the gluon fields do not couple to the magnetic background field and are still to be expanded in plane waves .",
    "this is similar with or without quark back - coupling effects to the yang - mills sector of the theory , since quarks appear in closed loops only .",
    "thus , the fully dressed gluon remains diagonal in fourier space .",
    "however , in the unquenched theory , the gluons feel the magnetic field due to the modification of the vacuum , filled by charged quark anti - quark pairs .",
    "the resulting splitting of the gluon propagator in longitudinal and transverse pieces ( with respect to the magnetic field ) will be discussed later in section [ sec : unquenched ] . in this section",
    "we will treat the quenched case , where the gluon remains isotropic .",
    "because of these two eigensystems involved , the dse in a background magnetic field needs a systematic investigation .",
    "we will therefore follow @xcite and start from the dse in position space in order to derive the equation in ( pseudo-)momentum space from first principles .",
    "this leads to a set of modified feynman rules describing a quantum theory in a background magnetic field , with the background treated statistically and to every order implicitly already in the propagators and vertices of the theory .",
    "the magnetic field is considered as constant and , for convenience , directed along the z - axis , with @xmath56 as before . in principle , also non - constant arbitrary fields can be treated within this method , provided one is able to solve for the eigenfunctions .",
    "one example , where the ritus eigenfunctions can be found analytically , is an exponentially decaying magnetic field , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "schwinger equation in position space and with local interaction is given by @xmath57 where the quark self energy reads @xmath58 with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 the @xmath61 generators in the fundamental representation .",
    "color indices are omitted in the following .",
    "one can now expand this equation in terms of ritus eigenfunctions . by multiplying with @xmath62 from the left and @xmath63 from the right ( where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the incoming and outgoing pseudo - momenta ) the integration over x and y yields @xmath66 using the completeness relation eq .",

    "the momentum vectors parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction are denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the self energy term is implicitly proportional to @xmath73 , a property that will later also show up explicitly .",
    "the dse for the quark self energy in the ritus eigenbasis is then given by @xmath74 to evaluate this expression , it is necessary to use the representation of the fermion propagator in ritus eigenfunctions .",
    "the eigenvalues of the fermion in an external magnetic field in the configuration given above are @xmath43 where @xmath34 labels the landau level .",
    "the quantum number @xmath18 is still a `` good '' ( referring to the fourier eigenfunction ) quantum number .",
    "however , as seen from the previous section , the energy of the fermion is degenerate with respect to this eigenvalue .",
    "the momentum @xmath18 merely fixes the origin of the @xmath75 component of our quantum harmonic oscillator system .",
    "the momenta of the fermions are @xmath76 and @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "the fermion propagator in ritus representation is given by @xmath79 where the sum / integral is over the eigenvalues @xmath43 as given in eq .",
    "( [ complete ] ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath18 accounts for the degeneracy of states of one landau level . before proceeding",
    ", one should notice that the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkritus ] ) is used here in analogy to the vacuum case , accounting for the anisotropy by introducing separate dressing functions for the transverse and longitudinal components . in principle , due to the appearance of further lorenz structures ( @xmath80 ) , the fermion propagator could possess a richer tensor structure .",
    "however , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , any other spin dependent tensor structures violate a remaining @xmath81 symmetry of the system by rendering the position of a putative pole structure in the quark propagator dependent on the direction of the external field . in our numerical investigation of the system , we find support for this point of view .",
    "when we take into account the additional structures , we obtain non - trivial solutions for @xmath82 only together with zero dressing functions in these additional structures . for brevity , we therefore omit these structures here and in the following from the start .    the isotropic fourier representation of the landau gauge gluon , as it is used in the quenched approximation , is given by @xmath83 where the integration is a momentum integration in the conventional sense since the gluon is still diagonal in fourier space .",
    "the gluon propagator function @xmath84 is related to the dressing function @xmath85 via @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the transverse projector . by plugging eq .",

    "the dressed quark - gluon vertex is a much more difficult object , which is not known in detail even for the case of vanishing background fields . for the purpose of this study and in order to make the equations tractable , we resort to a simple ansatz of the form @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is taken to be independent of the magnetic field . the explicit form of this ansatz is discussed below and given in appendix [ gluonvertex ] .",
    "naturally , these approximations should be improved in future work .",
    "however , the following sections will mainly be focussed on the necessary techniques and qualitative behavior of the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations in a magnetic background .",
    "other truncations might complicate some calculations done here , but the general features may be expected to be similar .    the integral over x , involving a product of ritus- and fourier eigenfunctions , is given by @xmath91 a similar integral for y remains to be done .",
    "if we had only particles in ritus or in fourier eigenfunctions at the quark - gluon vertex , this integral would be trivial due to the fact that those two systems are complete orthonormal vector spaces .",
    "we would simply obtain delta functions ensuring eigenvalue / momentum conservation . in our case",
    "however , we have interacting particles that are diagonal in different bases",
    ". nevertheless , the integral in eq .",

    "is exact with respect to the treatment of the magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , it is extremely difficult to solve numerically .",
    "the reason for that lies in the form of the functions @xmath98 , as can be seen when using an alternative derivation .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dse - self - raw ] ) , it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq : self : energy - full ] ) is identical to @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "therefore , solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : self - laguerre ] ) numerically involves an integration routine that is precise for an integrand that behaves like a polynomial of order @xmath36 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , @xmath36 is proportional to the number of landau levels @xmath34 , lying arbitrary close to each other for small @xmath101 , and hence a numerical treatment of the above expression is extremely hard .",
    "this is unfortunate for qcd , where in general the gluon dressing function or the quark gluon vertex are not known analytically and numerical approaches are the only available tool .",
    "an approximation of the above expressions for small magnetic fields is discussed in @xcite .",
    "here , we follow the opposite strategy and consider the case where the magnetic field is sufficiently large @xcite . to this end , note that the integrand in the quark self energy is given as a function of @xmath102 , where large values of @xmath103 are essentially suppressed .",
    "if the magnetic field is large , only terms up to the smallest order in @xmath102 need to be kept .",
    "we adopt this approximation in the following , keeping in mind that our results will not be reliable in the small field limit .    in this approximation ,",

    "this does not come as a surprise , since the eigensystem of the quark in an abelian background field is supersymmetric in the sense that transitions between two neighbouring landau levels constitute spin one transitions ( i.e. from @xmath110 to @xmath111 ) .",
    "gluons , perpendicular wrt . the magnetic field ,",
    "will therefore induce such transitions , whereas longitudinal gluons do not change the landau level of incoming and outgoing quarks at the vertex .",
    "the @xmath1 field breaks the initial @xmath45 symmetry to an @xmath112 symmetry in the t - z - plane .",
    "this explains the modification of the vertex @xmath113 seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullselfriyues ] ) as compared to the zero field case .",
    "these considerations can be easily generalized to unquenched qcd .",
