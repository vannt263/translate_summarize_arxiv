    "the properties of metallic thin films and nanostructures on crystalline surfaces are strongly interlinked with the morphology and chemical composition of the structures . epitaxial growth of in particular homoepitaxial and bimetallic systems have therefore been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "when growing multilayered heterostructures of several materials it becomes more complicated to control the growth and ensure that the desired structures are fabricated during deposition of the constituents of interest .",
    "besides diffusion on terraces also interlayer mass transport becomes decisive for the growth @xcite .",
    "multilayered systems of magnetic and non - magnetic metallic layers , which we have studied , are in particular interesting for their technological applications in the area of data storage and processing @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that capping a ferromagnetic thin film with a noble metal can influence the magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "we report here on the capping of ferromagnetic co nanoislands with ag thus producing ag / co / cu(111 ) nanostructures . the growth of co on cu(111 )",
    "is well known and the structural , electronic and magnetic properties have been studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "important for the work presented here is that for lower coverages at room temperature co forms bilayer high islands of triangular shape and a width of 325 nm @xcite . we have deposited ag on top and found that there is a preference for covering the co islands before the cu - terraces and we observe that the ag capped co islands , with few exceptions , are always fully covered with ag .",
    "we conclude that interlayer mass transport plays an important role where ag atoms , which have landed on the cu - terrace , must be allowed to ascend the bilayer high step edges of the co - island .",
    "experiments have been performed in an ultra high vacuum system ( @xmath1 mbar ) using a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) operated at room temperature and low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "we have used wsxm to analyze and display stm images @xcite .",
    "a cu(111 ) crystal was cleaned by sputter / anneal ( 500@xmath2c ) cycles .",
    "co was deposited with a flux of 0.14 ml / min at @xmath3=27@xmath2c .",
    "next , ag was deposited at room temperature ( or 70@xmath2c in one case ) with a flux of 0.44 ml / min or 3.6 ml / min . the area co coverage in all experiments is 0.150.36 ml and the ag overlayer coverage is varied from 0 to @xmath41.6 ml .",
    "note that for the co islands the term monolayer ( ml ) is used for the visible area coverage , meaning that the deposited amount of co is twice the visible coverage since the co islands are of bilayer height .",
    "stm image after depositing 0.07 ml ag on 0.2 ml co / cu(111 ) .",
    "the image is taken at a bias voltage of 0.35 v , the size is 157@xmath0108 nm and the z - scale spans 0.91 nm .",
    "the inset shows a linescan.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    after depositing co on cu(111 ) we observe the well - known bilayer high ( 3.9  ) islands @xcite mostly of triangular shape as well as star - shaped islands ( which is known to be a kinetic effect @xcite ) .",
    "an stm image of 0.07 ml ag deposited on a cu surface with a low coverage of co islands ( @xmath5 , where only bilayer high co islands are formed ) is shown in figure [ fig:20080826m7 ] .",
    "the bright islands are consisting of 2 ml co with 1 ml ag on top .",
    "although co islands of 3 ml height are never observed at these co coverages we note for comparison that the height of islands consisting of 2 ml co + 1 ml ag is 1  larger than 3 ml co. furthermore the ag cap layer shows a reconstruction ( discussed later ) .",
    "the less bright islands are 2 ml co islands that are not capped with ag .",
    "the heights are illustrated by the inset in figure [ fig:20080826m7 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that those co islands which _ do contain _ ag on top are almost _ completely covered _ with a ag layer . on the other hand ,",
    "the amount of ag on the cu surface is minimal although ag has been deposited homogeneously .",
    "ag thus accumulates on top of some of the co islands leaving the other co islands and the cu terrace clean .",
    "we note that occasionally it might happen that narrow corners of islands are not filled with ag ( as observable at the upper right corner of the largest star shaped island in figure [ fig:20080826m7 ] ) . as the ag coverage",
    "is increased to 0.35 ml we observe , besides fully capped co islands , that some of the co islands are surrounded by ag instead ( figure  [ fig : agcocu]a ) . at 0.8 ml ag ( figure [ fig : agcocu]b )",
    "most of the cu surface and all co islands are filled with ag , except from some of the smaller co islands . in figure",
    "[ fig : agcocu]c we have plotted the fraction of co islands that are capped with ag as a function of island size and see that larger islands have a higher probability of being capped .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , we will address the atomic structure of ag on co / cu(111 ) by stm and leed measurements . figure  [ fig : leed]a shows an stm image of bilayer thick co island which subsequently has been capped with ag .",
    "we observe a moir pattern with a periodicity of ca .",
    "24  and an apparent corrugation of 25 pm . for the diffraction experiments we deposited 3 ml co and subsequently 1.3 ml ag at room temperature .",
    "the leed image in figure  [ fig : leed]b show six main spots from the cu(111 ) substrate ( or the co islands which grow pseudomorphically @xcite ) . at each main spot",
    "there are six satellites due to the ag layer .",
    "this symmetry is identical to what is seen for a ag overlayer on cu(111 ) @xcite where the atomic structure depends on deposition temperature @xcite , but in any case the periodicity is ca .",
    "( 9@xmath09 ) originating from the lattice mismatch between cu and ag . for comparison",
    "we have deposited 1.3 ml ag on cu(111 ) and recorded an stm and a leed image ( shown in figure  [ fig : leed]c and d ) .",
    "since co grows pseudomorphically on cu a similar reconstruction is expected for ag grown on co / cu(111 ) .",
    "this is indeed observed here , although the ag - related leed pattern is more blurry for ag / co / cu(111 ) compared to ag / cu(111 ) .",
    "we believe this is due to edge effects at co islands where the periodicity of the ag moir pattern may change and the relatively smaller `` coherence areas '' for leed taken on ag / co / cu(111 ) than on the much larger ag areas directly on cu(111 ) , since ag grows almost layer by layer on cu(111 ) @xcite and the size of ag domains is therefore only limited by the terrace size of the cu(111 ) crystal . the moir pattern of ag on co / cu(111 ) has recently been shown to exhibit interesting electronic properties , where the electronic structure of the co islands is modulated with the same periodicity as the ag overlayer moir superstructure @xcite .",
    "we have studied the growth of a ag overlayer on co nanoislands on cu(111 ) at room temperature .",
    "the atomic structure of ag on co / cu(111 ) shows a ( 9@xmath09 ) periodicity due to the mismatch of lattice parameter .",
    "we find that there is a preferred nucleation for ag on top of co compared to cu(111 ) terrace sites , especially at low ag doses .",
    "this is quite remarkable since the co islands are all of bilayer height and an accumulation on top of the islands thus involves ascending steps of 2 ml height .",
    "we furthermore find that co islands are either completely free of ag or almost completely capped with ag .",
    "these nearly perfect multilayers can be expected to act as a model system for magnetic multilayer studies .",
