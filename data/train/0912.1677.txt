    "the coefficient of the mddi is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 being a unit vector .",
    "since it is difficult to derive the internal josephson effect from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) directly , we introduce the single mode approximation @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath38 with the relation @xmath39 .",
    "the approximation can be used when the shapes of the condensates are decided by the spin independent terms , namely @xmath40 .",
    "the condition is satisfied for @xmath41rb and @xmath42na .",
    "the validity of the approximation in spin-1 dipolar becs has been discussed by yi and pu @xcite .",
