    "the optomechanical device used for this experiment ( see methods figure  [ fig : m1 ] ) is fabricated from a silicon - on - insulator wafer , with a device layer thickness of 250  nm and 3  @xmath29 m of buried oxide .",
    "the structures are patterned using an electron beam writer and are then transferred into the top silicon layer in an sf@xmath56o@xmath57 atmosphere using a reactive ion - etcher .",
    "the devices are finally released and undercut using concentrated hydrofluoric acid .",
    "we design the nanobeams such that the fundamental mechanical breathing mode is at 5.3  ghz ( cf .  figure  [ fig:2]a , main text ) and the optical resonance is around 1550  nm ( the measured wavelength for the device used here is 1556  nm )  @xcite .",
    "the optical and the mechanical modes are co - localized in the center of the beam , where we create a defect region of the photonic- and phononic - bandgap , allowing for an optomechanical coupling rate @xmath58  khz . in order to minimize the thermalization time to the surrounding bath we opted , unlike previous designs , to not use any additional phononic shielding . as a consequence ,",
    "the mechanical quality factors at base temperature are found to be around @xmath59 ( see section _ mechanical response to optical pulses _ ) , compared to values above @xmath60 with a phononic shield  @xcite .",
    "the laser pulses are coupled directly into a tapered waveguide through an optical fiber with a lensed tip  @xcite , achieving efficencies of about 60% .",
    "the optical mode of the nanobeam is evanescently coupled to the waveguide , which is terminated with a periodic array of holes , acting as a mirror , allowing us to collect the light in reflection . for this experiment we chose a critically coupled device ( internal losses equal external losses ) with an optical linewidth @xmath61 of approximately 1.3  ghz .",
    "this places us well within the so - called resolved - sideband regime ( @xmath62 ) .      in this section",
    ", we provide a detailed description of the experimental setup .",
    "it consists of a pump part , detection part , and the electronic control part ( cf .",
    "methods figure  [ fig : m2 ] ) .",
    "pump part_. we use two identical , tunable continuous - wave ( cw ) lasers ( new focus 6728 ) as our light sources .",
    "the lasers are detuned and stabilized to the blue and red side respectively of the device s cavity resonance ( 1556.21  nm ) .",
    "the detuning is set to be the mechanical frequency ( 5.307  ghz ) .",
    "the two lasers separately pass through voltage - controlled tunable optical filters ( micronoptics ffp - tf2 , free spectral range @xmath6318  ghz , bandwidth @xmath6350  mhz ) to suppress any potential background emissions dispersed in frequency space . in order to create short optical pulses we modulate the filtered cw fields using acousto - optic modulators ( aom ; intraaction ) and an additional electro - optic amplitude modulator ( eom ; eospace ) .",
    "we employ variable optical attenuators ( voa ; sercalo ) on each path to control the pulse power .",
    "the pulses are combined on a variable optical coupler and then sent to the device in the dilution refrigerator ( vericold e21 ) via an optical circulator . at the device ( omc ; optomechanical crystal ) ,",
    "the optomechanical interaction with the blue ( red ) detuned pulses generates down-(up- ) converted photons , whose frequency is on resonance with the device s optical cavity frequency .",
    "the scattered photons are reflected back from the omc into the optical fiber and routed to the detection part through the output port of the circulator .",
    "detection part_. two voltage - controlled optical filters ( micronoptics ffp - tf2 , specification as above ) are installed in series at the beginning of the detection path .",
    "these filters are tuned on resonance with the omc cavity frequency such that they only allow ( anti- ) stokes scattered photons to be transmitted , while strong off - resonant pump photons are rejected ( suppression of about 84  db ) .",
    "after the filters , a 50:50 beam splitter divides the path . each output",
    "is additionally filtered by broadband wavelength - division multiplexors ( wdm ) , and fiber - coupled to two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspd ; photonspot , detection efficiency @xmath6390% , dark count rate @xmath6410  hz ) .",
    "the snspds are mounted on the 1  k plate inside the dilution refrigerator . upon receiving a photon",
    "the snspd generates a brief voltage spike , which is then electrically registered by a time - correlated single photon counting module ( tcspc ; picoquant timeharp 260 nano ) .",
    "the overall efficiency of detecting a photon leaving the omc is @xmath632.7% ( see below ) .",
    "+ _ control part_. in order to generate programmable optical pulses and to detect photons synchronously , we use a digital pulse generator ( dpg ; highland technology p400 ) and an arbitrary waveform generator ( awg ; agilent technologies 81180a ) .",
    "we first program the dpg to generate a ttl gate voltage signal for the aom on the read ( red ) path and to trigger the tcspc synchronously .",
    "the dpg additionally triggers the awg , which then generates a ttl gate voltage for the aom and a voltage pulse for the eom on the write ( blue ) path .          over the past few years",
    ", several experiments have demonstrated precise control over optical and mechanical states through continuous optomechanical driving , including coherent state transfer  @xcite and microwave - to - optics conversion  @xcite . due to the unavailability of the regime of single - photon strong cooperativity",
    ", strong drive fields have to be used in order to achieve the wanted coupling strength  @xcite .",
    "this leads to unwanted heating effects , in particular in the optical domain . since the mechanism of optical absorption couples only indirectly to the mechanical mode of interest  @xcite , using short optical pulses as nonstationary drive fields",
    "can substantially suppress the heating on short time scales  in particular at low temperatures  @xcite .    here",
    ", we probe the thermal response of the mechanical mode by pump - probe type measurements ; we first send a short blue - detuned pump pulse onto the omc cavity to intentionally heat the mode , and subsequently inject a red - detuned probe pulse to read out the mode s phonon occupancy . by repeating the experiment with varying time delay between the pump and the probe pulses , we monitor time - dependent evolution of the mode s phonon occupancy with a fixed initial impulse heating .",
    "the time delay @xmath33 is defined as the delay between the end of the pump ( blue ) pulse and the start of the probe ( red ) pulse detection window , as indicated in figure  [ fig:3]a in the main text . in that way",
    "the probing is performed after the optical absorption of the pump photons is completed . in order to ensure that the mechanical mode fully re - thermalizes to the bath",
    ", we set the duty cycle of sending another blue pulse after the red pulse to be one millisecond .",
    "for an improved signal to noise ratio , the pulse energies of the blue ( 200  fj ) and red pulses ( 2  pj ) used here are substantially larger than in the cross - correlation measurements .",
    "the effective mode temperature is inferred from the average count rate observed after sending the red pulse ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "@xmath65 can be decomposed into three terms :  ( 1 ) the rate proportional to the ( on - resonance ) anti - stokes raman scattered pump photons ( @xmath66 ) , ( 2 ) the term corresponding to pump photons leaked through the optical filters ( @xmath67 ) , and ( 3 ) the additional anti - stokes scattering term due to heating ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the mode during the readout pulse ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we minimize @xmath68 by only taking into account the first 30  ns of the red pulse as logical red pulse .",
    "@xmath67 gives a constant offset to the signal .",
    "@xmath66 directly reflects the mode s effective temperature , as the anti - stokes scattering rate is proportional to the average number of phonons ( @xmath69 ) in the mode ( see figure  [ fig:2]a in the main text ) . to that end , we deduce the following equation @xmath70 in which @xmath71 is the constant of proportionality .",
    "the long - term response of the mechanical mode to the initial blue pump pulse is shown in methods figure  [ fig : m3]a .",
    "it exhibits an exponential decay with a time constant of @xmath72  @xmath29s , which is interpreted as the mechanical damping time .",
    "the corresponding mechanical quality factor is then @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , we probe the short - term response of the mechanics within one microsecond after the blue pulse in more detail ( methods figure  [ fig : m3]b ) .",
    "we observe an increase of @xmath65 with a time constant of 0.37  @xmath29s ( fit to a simple exponential curve ) .",
    "this data reveals slow turn - on dynamics of pulse - induced heating , as previously studied in reference  @xcite .",
    "this time constant is even shorter than the decay of the cross - correlations ( see figure  [ fig:3]c in the main text ) , which we attribute to the increased thermal conductivity of silicon at higher temperatures , caused by absorption of increased optical pump energies .",
    "_ detection efficiency_. we first calibrate the fiber - to - chip coupling efficiency ( @xmath74 ) by sending in light far off - resonant from the omc cavity and then measure the reflected power ( @xmath75% one - way ) .",
    "the device impedance ratio ( @xmath76 ) , i.e.  the ratio of external coupling losses @xmath77 to total losses @xmath78 , is measured through the depth and the linewidth of the optical resonance , which we find to be @xmath79 .",
    "the detection efficiency of scattered photons for each detector ( @xmath80 ; i=1,2 ) consists of @xmath74 , @xmath76 , the total losses of the remaining detection paths ( @xmath81 ) , and the snspds quantum efficiencies ( @xmath82 ) . to measure @xmath80 , pulses with calibrated energy",
    "are sent off - resonantly to the omc ( @xmath83 ) , and the reflected photons transmitted through the optical filters are detected by the snspds ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "@xmath85 corresponds to @xmath86 , which we measure to be 0.013 for snspd1 and 0.019 for snspd2 .",
    "therefore , we deduce @xmath87 to be _ 1=1.1% + _ 2=1.6%.the detection efficiency of snspd1 ( characterized quantum efficiency @xmath88% ) is lower than snspd2 ( characterized quantum efficiency @xmath89% ) , as we needed to reduce the bias current to prevent the detector from latching  @xcite .",
    "this latching is probably caused by a nearby heater of the dilution refrigerator .",
    "it also results in a slow drift in the quantum efficiency of snspd1 .",
    "we note that the deduced @xmath81 come from the various optical elements in the beam path of the detection part and are in good agreement with their specified insertion losses .",
    "+ _ scattering rates and optomechanical coupling rate_. with the total detection efficiency of resonantly generated cavity photons , we can estimate the pair generation probability per write pulse ( optical energy @xmath90@xmath6340  fj ) to be @xmath23@xmath633.0% , including the effects of a finite starting temperature and leaked pump photons .",
    "the latter is calibrated by sending detuned optical pulses ( @xmath90@xmath6340  fj , @xmath91  mhz ) to the device .",
    "the generated optomechanical sidebands are now blocked by the filters and only leaked pump photons are detected .",
    "we measure a suppression of the pump pulse by 84  db compared to an on- resonance transmission .",
    "thus , approximately 1 out of 25 photons detected during the write pulse is a leaked pump photon . knowing the scattering rate and the energy of the detuned pump pulse",
    ", we can determine the single - photon coupling rate of our omc to be g_0==2825  .with this coupling rate , we can estimate the state - transfer efficiency of the red - detuned optical readout pulse of @xmath92  fj to be @xmath93% , where + e^i.here , @xmath94 are the annihilation operators of the temporal optical input ( output ) mode of the cavity resonance , @xmath95 the mechanical mode before the interaction , and @xmath96 an arbitrary but fixed phase between the inputs  @xcite .

    ", we can assume the in - coupled modes @xmath109 , @xmath110 to be in their respective ground state .",
    "tracing over @xmath109 , @xmath110 , we find that g_^(2)=g_^(2)i.e .",
    "the second order correlation function is independent of losses or , in the case of the mechanical mode , of `` ineffective '' partial state - transfer to the cavity mode .",
    "thus , e.g.  @xmath111 is equivalent to the autocorrelation of the photons scattered by the read pulse .    for autocorrelation measurements",
    ", we use a hanbury brown and twiss setup , by splitting the mode on a symmetric beamsplitter and sending it to a pair of detectors .",
    "we define the modes detected by the individual detectors @xmath112 , @xmath113 with their annihilation operators = ( ) ( ) with the splitting angle @xmath114 of the beam splitter and the annihilation operator of the second input of the beamsplitter .",
    "the input state can as before be approximated to be in its vacuum state .",
    "we find that the autocorrelation of mode @xmath71 equals the cross - correlation of the two detectors : g_^(2)=g_12^(2).for a definition in terms of probabilities , see below .          due to the low detection probability ,",
    "the uncertainty in the estimation of the second - order correlation functions is completely dominated by the estimation of the coincidence rate @xmath115 of the two modes @xmath71 , @xmath97 . as the absolute number of coincidences is low in some measurements ,",
    "gaussian statistics can not be used for estimating uncertainties .",
    "instead , we use the likelihood function based on the binomial distribution for estimating the probability @xmath23 of the underlying process , i.e.  to obtain @xmath116 counts in @xmath117 tries l(p , n , t)=p^n(1-p)^t - n.the normalization @xmath118 is chosen such that @xmath119 . the upper and lower uncertainty @xmath120 and @xmath121 are chosen numerically , such that they cover a 68% confidence interval around the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath122 , i.e.   @xmath123 , @xmath124 .    for the classical bound of the cross - correlation , @xmath125 , the likelihood functions of the individual autocorrelations are convoluted . due to their asymmetry ,",

    "the probabilities @xmath127 of a coincidence- or single detection event during the read ( @xmath38 ) and write pulse ( @xmath37 ) were used , with @xmath128 .",
    "this is valid for low event probabilities @xmath129 .",

    "figure  [ fig:3 ] , main text )",
    ". a further reduction of the evaluation period to @xmath133  ns ( @xmath134 ) has the advantage of reducing the influence of optical absorption of pump photons from the read pulse , while still obtaining solid statistics for the cross - correlation , @xmath135 .",
    "however , this reduction also results in a much lower state transfer efficiency @xmath136% ( compared to @xmath93% above ; see methods section _ characterization of the detection scheme _ ) . as a consequence",
    "we can not obtain independent statistics on the autocorrelation function of the read pulse , as the number of pulse sequences is too low to observe coincidences during the reduced read pulse @xmath137 .",
    "thus , no independent classical bound @xmath138 can be obtained for this case . as the measurement is identical to the one with longer evaluation window in the first column of methods table  [ table : m1 ] , it is reasonable to assume the same autocorrelation of the mechanical state and thus the same classical limit .",
    "we note that slight differences in the polarization of the two input lasers and the optimal axis of the snspds can lead to different detection rates of leaked pump photons between the read and the write pulse . while this does not influence the cross - correlation measurement , it is important to use the same laser source for the sideband asymmetry measurements .",

    "although this increase of the autocorrelation is not significant in our measurements , a behavior like this would be expected in the case of mixed thermal states of different temperatures , caused e.g.  by fluctuations in the absorbed power .",
    "effects that usually decrease the measured autocorrelation function of a thermal state , such as dark counts of the detectors and instantaneous heating by the read pulse , do not play a major role in our experiment due to the choice of pulse parameters . in conclusion , the classical bound in the present experiment",

    "<S> this data has been corrected for leakage of pump photons through the optical filters , which was independently measured and subtracted from our data ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a histogram of the total counts that are obtained when averaging over a 20  ns window centred on the peak ( within the dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced asymmetry in the rates ( of more than a factor of 40 ) corresponds to a thermal occupancy of @xmath30 and to a mode temperature of 69  mk . ]    </S>",
    "<S> precooling of the nanomechanical device is performed using a dilution refrigerator that operates at a base temperature of approximately 25  mk . </S>",
    "<S> if the mechanical system is in its quantum ground state of motion , then anti - stokes processes can not occur because no additional phonons can be extracted to support the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to stokes processes , which deposit mechanical energy and hence can always occur . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry in the scattering rates of these two processes is a direct measurement of the mean thermal phonon occupancy @xmath25 . using such photon - counting based sideband thermometry  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we create the desired photon - phonon pairs using a blue - detuned write pulse that is sufficiently weak to minimize the effects of residual absorption heating ( fwhm , 28.4  ns ; energy , 40  fj ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the relevant probability to generate a stokes scattered photon on cavity resonance to be @xmath32% . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , a red - detuned read pulse ( effective length , 55  ns ; energy of approximately 50  fj ) is injected at a time delay @xmath33 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]a ) , resulting in a phonon - to - photon conversion efficiency of approximately 3.7% ( see methods ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we correlate the measured stokes- and anti - stokes photons via the cross - correlation function @xmath34 $ ] , which is computed for read and write pulses originating from pulse sequences from different trials separated by @xmath35 iterations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the probability for a joint detection of both a stokes ( @xmath37 , write ) and an anti - stokes ( @xmath38 , read ) photon from these pulses , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the unconditional probabilities to detect either of the two photons . for all pair correlations of classical origin , </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath41 is bounded by a cauchy - schwarz inequality of the form  @xcite @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] , in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the autocorrelation functions for the optical and mechanical mode , respectively ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> a violation of this inequality  @xcite is an unambiguous measure for the non - classicality of the generated photon - phonon state . </S>",
    "<S> the cauchy - schwarz inequality for coincidence detection marks a well - defined border between the quantum and classical domain . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the fact that the glauber - sudarshan phase - space function , or p - function , is positive definite for every classical field . </S>",
    "<S> this places a fundamental limit on the relative strength of measurable cross - correlations versus autocorrelations between classical fields . </S>",
    "<S> previous applications of this limit include the distinction between the classical and quantum field theoretical predictions for the photoelectric effect  @xcite , and the storage and retrieval of non - classical states in the collective emission from an atomic ensemble  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed derivation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality for the case of non - stationary fields , as are being used here , is provided in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find a clear violation for an extended regime of time delays . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3]b shows the value of @xmath45 at a time delay of 100  ns . for pairs emitted from the same pulse sequence ( @xmath46 ) we find that @xmath47^{1/2 } = 2.09 + 0.23 - 0.16\\right\\rbrace$ ] , which obviously violates the classical bound . as expected , pairs emitted from different pulse sequences ( @xmath48 ) are uncorrelated and hence fulfil the inequality . upon increasing the time </S>",
    "<S> delay further , we find a violation even beyond @xmath49s ( see fig .  [ fig:3]c ) , which demonstrates that we can store and retrieve non - classical states for an extended time interval </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , the lifetime of these non - classical correlations is still much shorter than the lifetime of the mechanical excitations , @xmath50s . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the fact that the dynamics are dominated by heating caused by absorption of pump photons , which after some onset time drives the mechanical system towards a thermal state ( see methods ) . as a consequence , reducing the energy of the write pulse further should allow non - classical correlations to be maintained for much longer times . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , upon further reduction of the absorption heating of the read pulse , even higher values for the cross - correlation are obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation is also linked to the autocorrelation of the heralded mechanical state . if one considers two - mode optomechanical squeezing acting on an initial mechanical thermal state , and if @xmath51  as is the case in our experiment  then one obtains @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the largest value for @xmath41 observed in our experiment was @xmath53 ( using an energy of 1.7  fj in the first 30  ns of the read pulse ; see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , our system should allow for a hanbury brown and twiss experiment with phonons yielding @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement of this value with the current experimental parameters is difficult without a prohibitively large number of pulse sequences .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated non - classical correlations between single photons and phonons from a nanomechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this is a crucial step towards on - chip photon - phonon quantum interfaces , which are relevant for future solid - state based quantum information and communication architectures . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the observed photon - phonon correlation of @xmath55 suggests that conditional mechanical fock - state preparation should be possible with fidelities exceeding 85% ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to store and retrieve non - classical states over extended storage times that we reported also shows that nano - optomechanical resonators are a promising candidate for quantum memories . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the system we have demonstrated constitutes an improvement of almost two orders of magnitude on previous lifetimes of stored non - classical single - phonon states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , photon - phonon conversion on the single particle level is required to extend the ongoing efforts on mechanically transduced conversion between microwave and optical fields  @xcite into the quantum domain  @xcite .    </S>",
