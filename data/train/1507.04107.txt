    "the rapid progress in experimentally observing and even controlling electron dynamics in atoms and molecules demands powerful theoretical approaches ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite for reviews on this subject .",
    "one of the most challenging and , therefore , interesting tasks is the accurate description and understanding of the ultrafast and complex behavior arising from the electron - electron interaction .",
    "it can be expected that mean field , i.e. , hartree - fock - type approaches are insufficient , and that electronic correlations are important .",
    "these are especially difficult to treat in time - dependent theories with more than two active electrons , due to the complexity of the multi - electron wave function and even more so if the continuum is included for photoionization ; see  @xcite for an overview .    of particular interest in the context of strong field physics",
    "are molecular systems due to their much more complex dynamics and degrees of freedom owing to their geometrical structure . with",
    "the development of alignment and even orientation techniques  @xcite measurements in the molecular - fixed frame of reference become accessible , which allows for an investigation beyond orientation - averaged quantities .",
    "one question is the preferred direction of electron emission with respect to the electrical field direction of a linearly polarized laser and the influence of correlation effects in strong - field excitation scenarios of heteronuclear molecules . in a first approximation ,",
    "the tunnel ionization maps the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) to the continuum  @xcite , and by recollision strong - field ionization was even used to illustrate the homo experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , experimental evidence using co molecules  @xcite showed that this simplified one - electron picture needs to be adjusted , as effects such as inner - shell polarizations  @xcite , stark shifts and orbital distortions  @xcite have impact on the ionization dynamics .",
    "the question to what extent electronic correlations are important remains open . in ref .",
    "@xcite this topic has been addressed within a one - dimensional model of the four - electron lih molecule , and a shift of the preferred direction of emission is observed when electronic correlations are included .",
    "the immediate question of whether these effects are present in a full three - dimensional analysis shall be answered by this work and completed by angle - resolved investigations .",
    "all of these above - discussed issues call for a general , time - dependent theory including external ( possibly strong ) fields beyond a perturbative approach .",
    "the fundamental equation describing the physics of these quantum systems is the ( non - relativistic ) time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "however , its direct numerical solution , even by means of supercomputers , is limited to systems consisting of only one or two electrons , e.g. helium  @xcite or molecular hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical theories , such as the strong - field approximation and tunneling theories  @xcite provide physical insight but often draw on a simplified picture of the electron - electron interactions .    in order to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for more than two active electrons including the electrons interactions , approximate numerical techniques need to be employed .",
    "these include the time - dependent configuration interaction singles ( td - cis ) method  @xcite , multi - configuration time - dependent hartree - fock ( mc - tdhf )  @xcite or its generalizations time - dependent restricted or complete active space self - consistent - field ( td - ras / cas - scf )  @xcite and the state - specific - expansion approach  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "further , time - dependent density - functional theory ( td - dft )  @xcite and time - dependent close - coupling solutions of the tdse by using pseudo - potentials for the description of more than two electrons  @xcite have been applied to photoionization of molecules .",
    "especially the mctdhf family suffers from complicated non - linear numerics , and its applicability to photoionization is not yet fully understood .",
    "td - dft and the pseudo - potential approaches , on the other hand , rely strongly on the chosen functionals or potentials with unknown accuracy and lack tunable parameters to achieve convergence to the fully correlated solution .",
    "one of the most successful methods which bears some similarities to our present approach , is the time - dependent r - matrix method  @xcite .",
    "the aims of the present work are ( i ) to provide a fully _ ab - initio _ time - dependent approach to electron dynamics in diatomic molecules exposed to strong laser fields including a systematic ( i.e.  controllable ) approach to electron correlation without relying on pseudo - potentials and ( ii ) to demonstrate the method by shining light onto the question of whether electronic correlation decides from which end an electron leaves a heteronuclear molecule which is exposed to a strong electric single - cycle pulse .",
    "our approach is based on the time - dependent generalized - active - space configuration interaction ( td - gas - ci ) formalism which we apply within a prolate spheroidal single - particle basis set in combination with the well - established partition - in - space concept to tackle the scattering part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief introduction into the theory of td - gas - ci",
    ", we give a detailed overview on the used basis set and details of our implementation , in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "technical aspects and the explicit formulas and strategies of their efficient numerical handling are presented in the corresponding appendices . in sections  [ sec : results ] and",

    "we focus on the lih molecule in strong single - cycle infrared ( ir ) pulses and explore the influence of electronic correlations on the molecular photoelectron angular distributions ( pads ) and the preferred direction of electron emission as a function of the geometrical set - up .",
