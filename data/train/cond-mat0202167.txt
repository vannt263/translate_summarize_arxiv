    "the investigation of magnetostatic envelope solitons in yttrium - iron garnet thin magnetic films is one of the `` hot topics '' in nowadays physics . the advanced instrumentation for microwave pulse generation , detection and analysis together with the solid theoretical base has led to a growing interest in studying such localized objects .",
    "the definition `` magnetostatic soliton '' refers to a propagating pulse formed by large wavelength spin excitations which do not `` feel '' the exchange interaction and only the dipolar interactions could be taken into account .",
    "thus the processes are characterized by the landau - lifshitz and magnetostatic equations .",
    "the linearized solutions of these equations were obtained by damon and eshbach @xcite 40 years ago for arbitrary direction between wave vector of spin excitations and in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the nature of those excitations has been also studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "the weakly nonlinear limit for the mentioned equations also was considered for the particular cases when wave vector of spin excitations is either parallel ( backward volume waves ) or perpendicular ( surface waves ) to the direction of in - plane magnetic field .",
    "it was found out @xcite that the envelope of spin excitations in both cases satisfy 2d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation which permits well - known 1d soliton solutions depending on the relative sign of dispersion and nonlinear terms .    in full accordance with the theoretical predictions the bright solitons",
    "have been observed for nonlinear backward volume waves case @xcite - @xcite ( in - plane field is directed parallel to the carrier wave vector and propagation velocity of envelope soliton ) , while the dark solitons are created in case of nolinear surface waves @xcite-@xcite ( carrier wave vector and group velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field ) .",
    "it should be especially noted that all the mentioned solitons are observed in narrow strips . in such geometries the transverse instabilities do not develop and experiments show the stable propagation of 1d solitons along the waveguides . at the same time , in wide samples 1d solitons are in general unstable @xcite , @xcite and form metastable spin wave bullets which decay either after edge reflection or mutual interaction @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the solitons in in - plane magnetized films are studied both theoretically and experimentally only for two particular cases when the pulse propagates along or perpendicular to the magnetic field . only very recently",
    "the general case of linear and nonlinear magnetostatic wave propagation in wide samples was investigated @xcite for a wide range of angles between propagation velocity and magnetic field . in this connection",
    "the natural question arises : why one does not consider the nonlinear pulses in waveguides which are not either parallel or perpendicular to in - plane static magnetic field .",
    "as we show below for each magnitude of internal magnetic field it is possible to choose the direction ( besides 0 or 90 degrees ) of waveguide respect to magnetic field direction for which stable propagation of envelope solitons is allowed ( see inset of fig . 1 for a geometry of the problem ) .",
    "we determine the limits for magnitude of magnetic field , angle between waveguide and magnetic field vector and pulse frequency necessary for creation of dark or bright envelope solitons .",
    "we also calculate their widths and propagation velocities and claim that such solitons could be experimentally observed .",
    "the linear consideration is based upon the damon - eshbach formulation @xcite and its generalization by hurben and patton @xcite for the case of arbitrary angles between a wave vector @xmath0 and static internal magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "further we will examine only so - called `` near - uniform '' case ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 stands for a film thickness ) and derive the dispersion expansion over the parameter @xmath4 up to a second order .",
    "therefore we present here only the steps necessary for this purpose .",
    "consideration of the mentioned wave number range sufficiently simplifies calculations and , besides that , most of the experiments on the magnetostatic envelope solitons are made having such carrier wave numbers .    examining an in - plane magnetized ferromagnetic film with unpinned surface spins",
    "let us make the following definitions : @xmath5 is a direction of internal static magnetic field ; @xmath6 indicates the radius vector lying in the sample plane ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is a coordinate along the direction perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "then one can write down the landau - lifshitz and magnetostatic equations : @xmath9 \\qquad",
    "div({\\vec h}+4\\pi{\\vec m})=0 \\qquad rot{\\vec h}=0 .   \\label{2}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is a modulus of the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons ; @xmath11 is a magnetization density vector and @xmath12 is an internal total magnetic field . introducing dynamical dimensionless quantities",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 the following equations are obtained in the linear limit over @xmath15 : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . defining @xmath20 and searching for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) in periodical form over @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath23 being proportional to @xmath24 ) we get : @xmath25 where @xmath26 thus from ( [ 4 ] ) we can write down a linear solution of ( [ 2 ] ) in the form @xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 are arbitrary constants at the present stage , @xmath34 and let us remind that two dimensional vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 lye in the film plane and @xmath37 .    if @xmath38 we deal with a so - called surface mode , otherwise @xmath39 and a volume mode exists .",
    "however , note that due to the condition of `` near - uniformity '' @xmath2 the difference between these two modes is negligible",
    ".    the dispersion relation can be obtained from ( [ 5 ] ) if we remember about the boundary conditions . particularly the functions @xmath22 and @xmath40 should be continuous on the boundaries @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the film . the dispersion relation for both modes",
    "could be written as follows : @xmath43 working in the limit @xmath2 and keeping only the terms up to the second order of this parameter the following expression is obtained : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "then we get from ( [ 7 ] ) the following expressions for the derivatives of @xmath46 over @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 + { \\cal o}_1(kd)\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath50 + { \\cal o}_2(kd)\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath51+{\\cal o}'_1(kd)\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath52+{\\cal o}'_2(kd)\\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath53+{\\cal o}'_3(kd)\\right\\}. \\label{8}\\ ] ] the higher approximation terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not presented here because of their rather cumbrous form , but we use them in the calculation as far as the leading terms in expressions ( [ 8 ] ) vanish in vicinity of some points , e.g. @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "defining a wave envelope @xmath58 @xmath59 and following the well known modulation approach @xcite , @xcite the nonlinear equation for wave envelope @xmath58 is derived ( we redirect reader for details of obtaining this equation to the recent paper ref .",
    "@xcite where the full procedure is well described ) : @xmath60 all of the coefficients are defined by formulas ( [ 8 ] ) except the nonlinear coefficient @xmath61 which could be easily calculated taking into account that in nonlinear case we have a following identity : @xmath62 then substituting in ( [ 7 ] ) the expansion of @xmath63 in weakly nonlinear limit @xmath64 and using expression for @xmath61 from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite we get in large wavelength limit ( @xmath2 ) @xmath65 let us mention that if carrier wave vector is parallel or perpendicular to the static internal magnetic field the coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 are equal to zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but for arbitrary angles between @xmath0 and @xmath68 that is not the case . therefore we should introduce a new frame of references in order to vanish the nondiagonal term with coefficient @xmath69 .",
    "this could be done rotating the frame of references @xmath70 by the angle @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 then from ( [ 10 ] ) - ( [ 11 ] ) we obtain the following nonlinear equation : @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 afterwards in the moving frame of references @xmath78 we come to the 2d nonlinear schrdinger equation : @xmath79 and can write down its 1d bright or dark soliton solutions assuming that soliton envelope is a function only of variables @xmath80 and @xmath21 ( thus soliton propagates along a spatial axis @xmath81 with a velocity @xmath82 ) .",
    "if @xmath83 we have bright soliton with envelope @xmath84 while in case @xmath85 dark soliton solution is permitted : @xmath86 where @xmath30 denotes the contrast of dark soliton ( if @xmath87 one has a black dark soliton and gray dark otherwise ) and soliton width @xmath88 is defined for both cases by the same way : @xmath89 now we shall discuss the question about the stability of these 1d solitons .",
    "as well known 1d soliton solutions ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 13a ] ) of 2d nls are not stable to the transverse modulations with wavenumbers @xmath90 . according to the recent results ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath91 , thus , if the limits of transverse variable @xmath92 is less than soliton width the instabilities do not develop and 1d soliton solutions ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 13a ] ) would be stable . when one has fully spatial transverse variable @xmath92 the above condition means that narrow samples should be used . in our case",
    "we have the mixed variable @xmath93 and therefore also the condition for time dependent part has to be introduced : @xmath94 and in case @xmath95 the transverse instabilities do not develop even for infinite time .",
    "thus besides the condition ( [ 11 ] ) we get from ( [ v ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) additional condition on the stable soliton parameters : @xmath96 afterwards , in view of both conditions ( [ v ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) we finally obtain the following equality : @xmath97    solving ( [ cond0 ] ) as an expansion over small parameter @xmath4 we simply come to the following expression for the angle @xmath98 between carrier wavevector @xmath99 and static magnetic field : @xmath100 obviously there exist also trivial solutions @xmath101 and @xmath102 which will not be considered as long as they correspond to the well studied cases of bright backward volume wave and dark surface wave solitons , respectively . further using the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) and definitions for dispersion coefficient ( [ r ] ) we get the expressions for @xmath71 and @xmath103 as functions of expansion parameter @xmath4 : @xmath104 as long as the nonlinear coefficient @xmath61 according to ( [ 9 ] ) is always negative the possibility of appearance of dark or bright solitons depends on the sign of dispersion coefficient @xmath103 . in view of the second relation in ( [ 88 ] ) we can conclude that bright solitons appears if @xmath105 while dark solitons could be created for larger magnetic fields @xmath106 . from exps .",
    "( [ 13b ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) we are also able to get the expressions for soliton width and detuning of pulse frequency , respectively : @xmath107 while the soliton propagation velocity could be given by simple approximate formula : @xmath108    it should be noted that our perturbative approach violates if @xmath109 . besides that , we have a following restriction on the internal static magnetic field : @xmath110 . otherwise the threshold for three magnon processes is reached and localized nonlinear wave will decay rapidly @xcite .    as we see all of the quantities @xmath71 , @xmath111 and @xmath88 specifying the soliton are the functions of @xmath4 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus it is possible to plot @xmath111 and @xmath88 as the functions of @xmath71 for different @xmath113 ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we present how to choose the sample geometry ( in other words how to choose an angle @xmath71 between waveguide and static magnetic field ) and frequency of applied pulse for various @xmath114 in order to create bright or dark soliton .",
    "while in fig .",
    "2 we show the dependence of soliton width on the geometry of the problem and static magnetic field . in both cases the curves are limited because of restriction of `` near uniformity '' @xmath2 and the following parameters for yig film are used : @xmath115 and @xmath116 oe . note that bright solitons appear when the angle between waveguide and static magnetic field is less than 45@xmath117 . besides that",
    ", the detuning of pulse should be positive in order to create dark solitons .",
    "for the purpose to create bright solitons the angles should be larger than @xmath118 and detuning has to be negative .",
    "summarizing we can declare that the possibility of stable magnetostatic soliton propagation in in - plane magnetized ferromagnetic films in presence of tilted ( from waveguide direction ) static in - plane magnetic fields is proved .",
    "the widths and velocities as well as the range of angles between waveguide and magnetic field is obtained for which the stable soliton propagation is allowed .    however , as it was mentioned by the anonymous referee the waveguide border ( see dashed line in the inset of fig .",
    "1 ) could cause the reflection of carrier wave ( wave vector @xmath119 ) what will change the group velocity destructing thus the soliton . to avoid such a possibility we propose to use tube like magnetic waveguides ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . then the carrier wave will not be reflected and , besides that , the condition of quasi - one dimensionality still holds .",
    "let us make the following choice of the parameters of the problem : tube diameter @xmath120 mm ; film thickness @xmath115 and @xmath121 .",
    "thus the near uniformity condition @xmath2 is still valid and simultaneously the consideration of the sample as locally flat is allowed proving thus approximate validity of solutions like exp .",
