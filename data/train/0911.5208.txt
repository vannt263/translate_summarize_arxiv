    "the redshift evolution of the local scaling relations between galaxy bulge properties and the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) has important clues to the establishment of these tight relations across cosmic time .",

    "most of these studies report a strong positive evolution in bh mass for fixed bulge properties , which reaches as high as @xmath3 dex offset in bh mass from the local relation at the highest redshift probed ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this observed strong evolution is difficult to understand in two aspects . for the @xmath0 relation , numerical simulations based on self - regulated bh growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and other theoretical arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) favor a mild evolution in the normalization of the @xmath0 relation , in conflict with the otherwise claimed strong evolution . for the @xmath5 or @xmath2 relation ,",
    "many of the observed hosts at earlier epoches are already bulge - dominated , hence unless their bulges continue to grow a considerable amount over time , it is difficult to understand how these systems would have migrated to the local relation .",
    "an alternative explanation for this observed strong evolution is that it is caused , at least partly , by the systematics involved in deriving both host properties and bh masses .",
    "all these studies mentioned above focus on broad line quasar samples , with host properties measured from the quasar - light subtracted images or spectra .",
    "the systematics in subtracting the quasar light , as well as in converting observables ( such as photometric colors or spectral properties ) to physical quantities ( such as bulge stellar mass ) is a potential contamination to the final results .",
    "more importantly , the samples are predominately selected in quasar luminosity and hence are _ not _ unbiased samples for studies of the bh scaling relations .",
    "one statistical bias resulting from using quasar - luminosity selected samples was discussed in detail in @xcite . because there is cosmic scatter in the bh scaling relations and because the galaxy luminosity ( or stellar mass , velocity dispersion , etc ) function is bottom heavy , there are more smaller galaxies hosting the same mass bhs than the more massive galaxies . hence",
    "when selecting samples based on quasar luminosities , low - mass bhs are under - represented , leading to an apparent excess in bh mass at fixed host properties .",
    "if the cosmic scatter in bh scaling relations increases with redshift and reaches @xmath6 dex , it can in principle account for all the excess in bh mass observed for the most luminous quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the bh masses are estimated using the so - called virial method based on single - epoch spectra . in this method",
    ", one assumes that the broad line region ( blr ) is virialized , and the bh mass can be estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the blr radius and @xmath9 is the virial velocity ; one further estimates the blr radius using a correlation between @xmath8 and the continuum luminosity @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 , found in local reverberation mapping ( rm ) samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this uncertainty must come from the imperfectness of using luminosity and line width as proxies for the blr radius and virial velocity , i.e. , there are substantial _ uncorrelated _ variations @xmath16 in luminosity and variations @xmath17 in line width , which together contribute to the overall uncertainty @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 one can then imagine a statistical bias will arise if the underlying active black hole mass function ( bhmf ) is bottom heavy . in particular , the variations ( uncompensated by the variations in fwhm ) of luminosity at fixed true bh mass , @xmath20 , will scatter more lighter bhs into a luminosity bin than heavier bhs , and bias the mean bh mass in that bin .",
