    "astrophysical jets detected so far seem to be attached to objects where an accretion disk is indicated to be present .",
    "the similarities between jets from the different sources imply that the basic mechanism for jet formation should be the same .",
    "( 0,0 )    what kind of mechanism turns the inflowing matter of the accretion disk into an outflow from the disk ( or the star ) is still not really known , although it seems to be clear that magnetic fields play a major role .",
    "our model is sketched in figure  [ f1 ] . in order to model the time - dependent evolution of jet formation",

    "we do not solve the energy equation but define the internal energy of the system with eq .",
    "we may expect that the turbulence pattern in the disk may also enter the disk corona and the jet , and that the jet flow itself is subject to turbulent diffusion .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is denoted by the variable @xmath11 , and other have its usual meaning , with @xmath12 with @xmath13 , an alfvnic turbulent pressure , added to the hydrostatic pressure @xmath14 .",
    "the results of one reference set of global simulations with high resolution ( numerical mesh of @xmath15 grid points , physical grid of @xmath16 ) are presented in figure  [ f2 ] .      in order to investigate only the gross behavior of the jet flow and not its structure in detail , we run another set of simulations with lower resolution ( numerical mesh of 280@xmath1780 grid points , physical grid of ( z@xmath17r)=(140@xmath1740)r@xmath18 ) ",
    "see figure  [ f3 ] .          below the ",
    "critical @xmath11 ` ' in our choice of parameters ( @xmath19 ) , the time of reaching the quasi - stationary state of the inner jet is approximately linearly dependent on @xmath11 ( figure  [ f4 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the much faster computation of the low resolution simulations allowed us to follow the jet evolution for a very long time even in the case of a high magnetic diffusivity ( up to 4000 disk rotations ) . the observed de - collimation of the matter flow with increasing diffusivity is most evident if we plot the mass and momentum fluxes across the boundaries of the inner jet region .      in combination with various physical effects ",
    "magnetic and inertial forces , pressure and gravity  the magnetic diffusion will modify the mhd structure of the jet . as the flow approaches the alfvn surface , a toroidal magnetic field component is induced (  wound - up ` ' ) due to the inertial back - reaction of the matter on the field .",
    "the toroidal field may lead to ( de- ) accelerating lorentz forces @xmath20 and ( de- ) collimating forces @xmath21 where , here , the perpendicular and parallel projection is made with respect to the poloidal magnetic field ( which , only in the case of ideal stationary mhd is parallel to the poloidal velocity ) .",
    "the winding - up of the poloidal magnetic fields is less efficient since magnetic diffusion leads to a slip of matter across the field .",
    "the induced toroidal magnetic field is weaker leading to a less efficient acceleration by lorentz forces but also to a de - collimation .",
    "as a de - collimation of the poloidal magnetic structure also implies a smaller launching angle for the sub - alfvnic flow , the magneto - centrifugal acceleration mechanism may work more effective .",
