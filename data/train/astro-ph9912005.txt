    "there are now several hints indicating that our universe could presently undergo a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "these hints consist in a set of recent observations including particulary ( but not only ) measurements of the hubble law using type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "all these observations seem to point towards the same conclusion : a fluid with a negative pressure to energy density ratio contributes for @xmath5 of the matter content of the universe and therefore represents the dominant component of this matter content .",
    "if this conclusion is confirmed , this immediately raises the question of the physical nature and origin of this fluid . at first sight",
    ", a natural candidate is the cosmological constant . a cosmological",
    "constant is equivalent to a fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath6 .",
    "this seems in agreement with the recent analysis of the data which indicate that @xmath7 or @xmath8 according to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath9 corresponds to an energy scale of @xmath10 which is very far from the natural scales of high energy physics .",
    "therefore , even if there is presently no contradiction with observations , it seems that this hypothesis runs into theoretical problems .",
    "another explanation was recently put forward in refs .",
    "it consists in assuming that the unknown fluid is a scalar field named quintessence .",
    "then , the following questions need to be answered .",
    "firstly , why is it so that this fluid is dominating today ?",
    "this is the coincidence problem .",
    "secondly , in order to explain @xmath11 , is it necessary to fine tune a free parameter of the theory to a value very far from the natural scales of particle physics ? in that case , nothing would have been gained in comparison with the cosmological constant case .",
    "this is the fine tuning problem .",
    "thirdly , is it possible to find values of the pressure to energy density ratio compatible with recent findings ?",
    "this is the equation of state problem .",
    "fourthly , can realistic quintessence models be implemented in the realm of high energy physics ?",
    "this is the model building problem .",
    "it has been argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that these four problems can be partially tackled if the potential is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are free parameters .",
    "the coincidence problem is solved because the equation of motion of the scalar field possesses a tracking solution . just after reheating , at a redshift of @xmath15 ,",
    "the allowed initial conditions for the energy density of the quintessence field are @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 orders of magnitude ! ) . for any initial value in this range , the field",
    "is led to the same solution .",
    "the fine tuning problem is partially solved . for @xmath18 , for example , @xmath19 in order to have @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the natural scale of the problem is now comparable to the natural scales of particle physics .",
    "however , it is still necessary to adjust this free parameter .",
    "the main problem for the models based on the potential ( [ potsusy ] ) could come from the equation of state .",
    "it has been show that @xmath1 can not be less than @xmath20 .",
    "this seems in disagreement with observations if one believes in the estimates of ref .",
    "however , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there is still an open windows for these models .",
    "finally , the question of the model building have been adressed , in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite where a model based on global supersymetry ( susy ) has been proposed . in this model ,",
    "the khler potential is flat , @xmath21 , and the superpotential is given by @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to an inverse power law scalar potential .",
    "the aim of this article is to show that any realistic model of quintessence must be based on supergravity ( sugra ) .",
    "we proove that , generically , taking into account sugra improves the agreements with observations , especially with regards to the equation of state . in order to illustrate these general properties",
    ", we exhibit a specific model where concrete calculations can be performed and we propose a new potential for the quintessence field , the supergravity tracking potential .",
    "the questions evoked in the previous section can be adressed if the field is on tracks . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this means that it should satisfy the equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble constant .",
    "this equation implies @xmath0 now .",
    "since sugra corrections are of the order @xmath25 , they are crucial for quintessence and any realistic model should be based on sugra .",
    "the sugra ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) scalar potential is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a term coming from the gauge sector .",
    "then , we can draw general conclusions .",
    "firstly , the khler and super potentials should be chosen such that negative contributions do not dominate the scalar potential .",
    "this is not the case if the sugra corrections to the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are taken into account .",
    "secondly , we see that for a typical polynomial khler potential @xmath32 , the term @xmath33 is unimportant throughout almost all the cosmic evolution since @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the term @xmath35 should be responsible for the tracking properties .",
    "thirdly , the term @xmath33 should dominate now since we have @xmath0 . since the exponential is a rapidly growing function , this implies that the potential energy should largely dominate the kinetic energy today . in other words ,",
    "this automatically pushes the ratio @xmath36 towards @xmath2 which is precisely needed in order not to be in conflict with observations .",
    "these properties are generic , i.e.  they do not depend on the details of the model , even if of course it is certainly possible to find very specific cases where they are not true .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , string - inspired khler and superpotentials were proposed .",
    "they lead to the sugra tracking potential given by : @xmath37 in the next section , we investigate in more details the cosmological implications of this potential .",
    "in order to study the properties of the sugra tracking solutions , we have numerically integrated the full einstein equations .    we have checked that the coincidence problem is still solved in the sugra case , see refs .",
    "@xcite . the evolution of @xmath36 is displayed in fig .",
    "( [ omegaz ] ) .",
    "the influence of the exponential term at the end of the evolution , for small redshifts , is clearly visible . for @xmath38 , the value of the equation of state for the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ potsusy ] ) is @xmath39 , a value ruled out by observations . for the sugra tracking potential ,",
    "we find : @xmath40 for @xmath11 . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , this is less than one sigma from the likehood value . for @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", @xmath36 changes between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . if @xmath46 then @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , these numbers do not require any fine tuning of the free parameter @xmath48 .",
    "this is because the value is mainly determined by the exponential factor which is @xmath48 independent .",
    "this property is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ omega - alpha ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to emphasize that taking into account sugra is mandatory if one wishes to construct a realistic model of quintessence .",
    "this is because when the field is on tracks , @xmath0 .",
    "then , a natural consequence is that theoretical predictions fit better the current data . in particular",
    ", the model presented here predicts @xmath4 which lies into the one sigma error interval ."
