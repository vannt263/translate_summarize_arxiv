    "submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) are the most powerful starbursts known in the universe . with star formation rates , derived from their far - infrared luminosity , often exceeding several @xmath7m@xmath4yr@xmath8 ,",
    "smgs are capable of building up a stellar mass of @xmath9m@xmath4 in less than 100 myr .",
    "this formation process of smgs resembles the monolithic collapse scenario ( eggen et al .",
    "1962 ) , but might be driven by hierarchical processes that merges two gas rich galaxies .",
    "the role of accretion and minor mergers is currently unknown , but could play a role in the slightly less luminous smgs .",
    "it has been proposed that the end result of the smg process are the giant elliptical galaxies seen in the local universe ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ) .    despite a substantial observational effort over the last 15 years , there are still unanswered questions concerning smgs : the redshift distribution , the stellar mass content , what are the progenitors and descendants , and finally , whether the smgs play a significant role in the overall formation and evolution of galaxies or do they just represent the most extreme manifestation of a general star forming galaxy population ?",
    "the main hurdle in learning more about the smg population has from the start been the difficulty in identifying optical and near - infrared counterparts .",
    "smgs are initially identified using single dish bolometer arrays , with an angular resolution @xmath10 . by pushing interferometric radio continuum observations to levels where massive star formation is the main contributor to the continuum emission , and with sub - arcscond angular resolution , it was possible to identify the most likely counterparts of some smgs and thereby obtain optical spectroscopic observations ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2003 ; aretxaga et al . 2007 ;",
    "smolcic et al .",
    "2012a ; hodge et al .",
    "this method , however , can at best only account for a limited fraction of all smgs . a significant number of smgs remain undetected even in the deepest radio continuum observations , possibly due to being at high redshift where the radio continuum falls below the detection limit , and some do not reveal optical emission and no spectroscopy can be done .",
    "an illustrative example of an elusive smg is the brightest submillimeter source in the hubble deep field north ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) . despite a large observational effort",
    ", no optical / near - infrared counterpart has been identified .",
    "the redshift was only recently determined using molecular emission lines and found to be @xmath11 ( walter et al .",
    "the counterpart remains undetected at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition to using radio continuum to identify optical / nir counterparts , spitzer mid - ir data has also been used ( e.g. pope et al .",
    "2006 ; biggs et al . 2011 ; targett et al . 2013 ; alberts et al . 2013 ) .    to avoid the potential selection bias inherent in using the radio continuum to identify smg counterparts , and to achieve a more direct association between the smg and potential counterparts ,",
    "it is better to directly target the millimeter and submillimeter emission using interferometric techniques with sub - arcsecond resolution .",
    "this method has successfully been used with the sma , carma , plateau de bure and now also alma interferometers ( e.g. younger et al .",

    "these bias - free studies have found several smgs at redshifts @xmath12 , challenging both the previously derived redshift distribution of smgs and the modeling of the formation of massive galaxies in the early universe ( e.g. baugh et al . 2005 ) .",

    "( 2013 ) , pushing the redshift limit of the smg phenomenon to within @xmath51 gyr from the big bang .",
    "observations of co emission lines in lensed smgs detected with the south pole telescope ( vieira et al .",
    "2013 ) suggests that the radio continuum identification of smgs may have missed a significant fraction of @xmath15 smgs and there are indications that sources selected at longer wavelengths may have redshift distributions that peak at higher redshifts than 870@xmath0 m selected samples ( e.g. smolcic et al .",
    "2012 ; yun et al .",
    "2012 ; vieira et al .",

    "regardless of their redshift , smgs tend to have a remarkably uniform molecular gas mass .",
    "summarizing various co detections from the literature , and adopting a uniform co - h@xmath16 conversion factor of 0.8m@xmath4(kkms@xmath17 , the typical molecular gas mass of smgs is @xmath18m@xmath4 with only a small dispersion .",
    "( e.g. greve et al . 2005 ; tacconi et al . 2008 ; coppin et al . 2009 ; bothwell et al . 2013 and references therein )    with the new alma interferometer it is possible to detect sub - millimeter continuum emission at a flux level of @xmath19mjy with sub - arcsecond resolution in a matter of minutes .",

    "2013 ) . given the positional accuracy of the less data ( @xmath25 ) and the 006 pixel scale of the hst data , we can securely connect the smgs with their counterparts , with two caveats .",
    "the central location of the submm emission may not coincide with the center of optical / near - infrared emission due to strong dust extinction .",
    "this effect is exacerbated with increasing redshift as shorter wavelength emission is shifted into a given optical / near - infrared filter .",
    "we must therefore allow for coordinate offsets of the order of galactic scales , typically @xmath26 , or 8.5kpc at @xmath27 .",
    "the second caveat is the possible , although improbable , coincidence of a background smg with a foreground galaxy .",
    "while this is unlikely for such a small sample , the fact that the initial laboca survey is luminosity limited creates a bias towards sources that may be gravitationally lensed by a foreground object .",
    "we inspected the hst images for signatures of gravitational lensing of the smg counterparts , without finding any ( sect .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "note that the lack of lensing signature does not in itself mean that the designated counterpart and the smg are coincident .",
    "if the redshifts are comparable , they could still be separate objects .",

    "parameters , such as photometric redshift , stellar mass , age , extinction and metallicity are derived by fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) to the counterparts of the less sources . in order to fit the sed of each galaxy in an unbiased and prior - free manner",
    ", we explore a large parameter space for redshift , stellar age , extinction , metallicity , and star formation history . the current version of the sed fitting algorithm is an updated version of the one described in wiklind et al ( 2008 ) . here",
    "we use a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) with lower and upper mass cutoffs at 0.1 and 100 m@xmath4 , respectively ( chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "the resulting seds are redshifted in the range @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the redshift resolution is then further refined to @xmath30 using spline fitting in the e@xmath31 parameter space .",

    "additional attenuation by neutral hydrogen absorption in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is added using the madau ( 1995 ) prescription for the mean igm opacity .",
    "the age of a stellar population is measured from the onset of star formation .",
    "the age range extends from 50 myr to 7 gyr , with an approximate logarithmic step .",

    "four different metallicities are used , 0.2 , 0.4 , 1.0 , and 2.5 z@xmath4 .",
    "the star formation history is parametrized as a so - called ` delayed-@xmath35 ' model ( see lee et al .",
    "2010 ) : @xmath36 . while having the same number of parameters as the standard exponentially declining @xmath35-models , the delayed-@xmath35 models exhibit an increasing star formation rate for @xmath37 , and a declining part for @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 , the parametrization resembles the exponentially declining @xmath35 models .",
    "a recent burst of star formation can be parametrized with a young @xmath40 and a small @xmath35 , but for multiple generations of stellar populations the delay-@xmath35 model , as any other single - component parametrization of the star formation history , will produce an average , luminosity weighted , spectral energy distribution . in this case , the age and @xmath35 parameters will reflect the average sed .",
    "the stellar mass is estimated from the sed by integrating over the entire spectral energy distribution , giving @xmath41 and then multiplying with the @xmath42 ratio derived for the best - fit sed .",
    "the integration is done over the non - obscured sed , from 92 to 160@xmath0 m , only considering the stellar sed .",
    "this method has been shown to give robust mass estimates when compared with galaxies from semi - analytical models , where the mass of the stellar component is known ( lee et al .",
    "2010 ; wiklind et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the bc03 models only include stellar components and are not designed to model an agn contribution to the sed . since a substantial fraction of smgs",
    "are known to contain an agn ( e.g. donley et al .",
    "2010 ) , the sed fitting results could be biased by the agn s uv contribution .",
    "this would be modeled as a young stellar component and/or as having less extinction present than what is the true case . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ results ] , however , this bias does not appear to be present in the sed fitting results for the less sources , even though almost 50% of them are designated as containing an agn based on x - ray ( chandra 4ms survey , xue et al .",
    "2011 ) , radio ( padovani et al . 2011 ) and ir signatures ( courtesy j. donley , see donley et al .",
    "in fact , the stellar content of the smgs are characterized by a relatively evolved population .",
    "this agn fraction is much higher than the x - ray survey of cdfs smg s by wang et al .",
    "2013 ) , who finds that @xmath510% of the smgs exhibit x - ray emission .",
    "the possibility that an obscured agn contributes to the observed fluxes is handled by subtracting a power - law continuum of the form @xmath43 and evaluating the @xmath44 for the resulting sed fit .",
    "the power - law index is expected to be in the range @xmath45 ( caputi 2013 ) .",
    "the power - law emission is scaled to the observed irac 8@xmath0 m flux and the power - law flux is subtracted from the observed photometric values at shorter wavelengths . a new sed fit is done and the @xmath44 evaluated . the scaling to the 8@xmath0 m flux is done with a multiplicative factor , ranging from 0 ( no power - law emission at 8@xmath0 m ) , to 1 ( all of the 8@xmath0 m emission is due to a power - law component ) in steps of 0.05 .",
    "the sed fit with the minimum @xmath44 is selected as the best - fit sed .",
    "this approach is similar to that of hainline et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , michalowski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and caputi ( 2013 ) .",
    "the slope of the power - law emission varies depending on the type of agn and/or star formation activity that is the source of the emission .",
    "nearby agns of type-1 have slopes @xmath46 ( edelson & malkan 1986 ; neugebauer et al . 1987 ) and",
    "local seyfert 2 galaxies are characterized by a steeper continuum sed with @xmath47 ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1997 ) . obscured starburst galaxies will have a near- to mid - infrared slope that is similar to that of type-2 agns .",
    "the average mid - infrared slope for smgs determined from spitzer irs data is @xmath48 ( menndez - delmestre et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the latter sample contains smgs similar to the ones discussed here , and we will assume @xmath49 .",
    "a steeper slope would have a minimal impact on the observed fluxes .",
    "the slope could , however , be shallower . when extrapolated to 24@xmath0 m",
    ", the power - law continuum flux should not exceed the observed 24@xmath0 m flux .",
    "we will therefore use the 24@xmath0 m flux to constrain the slope of the power - law continuum , keeping in mind that for some redshifts the 24@xmath0 m flux may get contribution from pah features . constraining the value of @xmath50 leads to a power - law flat enough to subtract more than the observed emission at short wavelengths .",
    "this may be an artifact of extending the power - law into restframe uv wavelengths .",
    "we therefore impose an arbitrary limit to the subtraction of the continuum to only be applied to fluxes at restframe @xmath51 . except for",
    "the cases of a very flat power - law ( @xmath52 ) this limitation does not affect the outcome of the fitting and subtraction process .    in order to assess the stability of the best fit sed with respect to photometric uncertainties , we did a monte carlo simulation where the photometric values are allowed to vary stochastically within their nominal errors .",
    "the flux errors are assumed to normally distributed and uncorrelated ( see wiklind et al .",
    "2008 for a more detailed description of the procedure ) .",
    "we generate @xmath7 photometric data sets for each galaxy .",
    "bands with non - detections are still treated as upper limits .",
    "we then determine the best - fit parameters for each realization of the photometric data in the same manner as described above .",
    "the resulting distribution of the best - fit values for each parameter represents the probability distribution for this particular parameter and allows an estimate of the confidence of the various solutions with respect to the photometric values and uncertainties .",
    "the outcome from the monte carlo simulations is often a well - behaved ( e.g. close to gaussian ) distribution of values for the parameters ( in particular photometric redshift and stellar mass ) .",
    "there are , however , cases where the distribution is strongly non - gaussian and where the solution ` flips ' between very different parameter values where the solutions can have equal weight in terms of their @xmath53 values",
    ". this behavior can be due to aliasing between the lyman and balmer breaks ( e.g. dahlen et al .",
    "2013 ) .    for each solution of a photometric redshift",

    "gives a probability distribution that takes the stability of the solutions into consideration .",
    "we combine the @xmath55 s by taking the median value for each redshift bin @xmath30 . since the resulting @xmath55 can still exhibit multiple peaks , we assigned the peak value as the most probable photometric redshift .",
    "the photometric redshifts obtained in the sed fitting process with this code has been tested together with 11 other codes ( see dahlen et al . 2013 ) and found to give results consistent with both a spectroscopic comparison sample and the other codes .",
    "we measure the cas ( concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness ) parameters of the smg counterparts using hst / wfc3 f160w images .",

    "our estimates of the stellar masses for the high - mass smgs are smaller than that of the galaxies believed to be the final descendants , giant elliptical galaxies , and are thus consistent with continued build - up of stellar mass through gas infall and/or merging .",

    "the two bright regions seen in the f435w filter are either absent or very weak in the wfc3 f160w filter showing that these are young star forming regions with little dust obscuration , while the main component of the galaxy either contains an older stellar population and/or is more obscured . in this case",
    "the sed parameters are biased towards a younger and less massive stellar component than what would have been derived without the uv component .",
    "less 18 seems to be the only case in the present sample where there is a uv component that is not seen at longer wavelengths .",
    "the high metallicities of the smgs in our sample imply a prolonged star formation activity and are in accord with the older ages of the stars found through the sed fitting .",
    "there are , however , degeneracies between metallicity , age and dust extinction . if the ages are overestimated , it requires either the metallicity to be even higher or the dust extinction to be more severe in order for the stellar templates to fit the observed fluxes . since both the implied metallicities and extinction values are already very high for the present smg sample , it is difficult to include a significantly younger stellar population and still achieve a good fit to the observed data .",
    "this suggests that the young stars are likely to be heavily obscured and their contribution to the observed fluxes are small .",
    "one of the main questions regarding smgs is if they are the result of the merging of two gas - rich galaxies , with the end result being a giant elliptical galaxy ( e.g. blain et al . 2002 ) , or if the star formation activity is fueled through some other mean . in the merging scenario one would expect the smg counterparts to show the presence of close neighbors and/or tidal features .    the smgs presented here have some properties similar to local ulirgs : large dust and gas - masses , a high star formation rate and a large far - infrared luminosity ( sect .",

    "this makes the smgs different from local ulirgs , which are almost exclusively major mergers ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",

    "the sed fit of the neighbor , both with and without the irac fluxes , suggests that it is situated at a completely different redshift and , hence , not physically related to the designated counterpart of less 10 . nevertheless , we did a sed fit combining the fluxes for the two galaxies .",

    "this type of isolated far - infrared luminous , dusty , gas rich and massively star forming galaxies seen at high redshift is not present in the local universe , but is consistent with models showing that high - z smgs are fueled by both smooth inflows and major mergers , depending on the observed intensity if the star formation activity .    comparing the morphological parameters of the smgs with a sample of galaxies at the same redshift and with similar stellar masses",
    "shows that the smgs are among the most asymmetric galaxies in the sample .",
    "apart from the merging systems , the asymmetry can be caused by a clumpy light distribution , clearly seen in three of the isolated galaxies .",
    "asymmetry can also be caused by a patchy dust distribution , although this is not directly inferred from the present data .    in most cases",
    "the center of the submm emission , as derived from the alma data , is directly associated with the restframe optical emission , taking the positional uncertainties into consideration , but for a few of the smgs the submm emission is offset from the stellar component by @xmath54 kpc .",
    "the smgs with larger offsets include 2 of the merger systems and one isolated smg . in the latter case",
    ", it can not be excluded that the submm emission originates from a background galaxy . in general , despite the high angular resolution provided by hst and alma , the definition of the optical counterpart can remain elusive and great care has to be applied when comparing properties such as star formation rate , stellar mass and age of the smg and the optical counterpart .    sed fitting to the smgs provide their photometric redshift , stellar mass , extinction , metallicity and star formation history .",
    "the redshifts of the smgs range from z@xmath168 to z@xmath169 .",
    "the sample contains four smgs with spectroscopic redshifts ( including the highest redshift source at z@xmath169 ) .",
    "two out of ten smgs are located at z@xmath24 .",
    "the median stellar mass is @xmath170m@xmath4 , lower than early estimates of the characteristic stellar mass of smgs .",
    "the age of the stellar populations is typically @xmath50.7@xmath621 gyr .",
    "this is well in excess of the expected length of the smg phase and suggests a complex star formation history involving previous star formation epochs .",
    "the metallicity as well as the dust extinction is already large for the smgs in the sample , making it difficult to explain the old ages with degeneracies among the fitted parameters .",
    "the smgs can be divided into two groups in terms of their stellar masses .",
    "one high - mass group with stellar masses @xmath171m@xmath4 showing a remarkably small dispersion , and one low - mass group with stellar masses 2 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the high - mass group .",
    "both groups have similar far - infrared / submm properties .",
    "it is possible that the low - mass smg counterparts represent an earlier stage of the smg phase and stellar mass will rapidly increase with time .",
    "the two galaxies with the smallest stellar masses also have the largest contribution from a mid - ir power - law continuum .",
    "the small stellar mass is , however , not caused by the removal of a mid - ir power - law as the optical through near - infrared fluxes are lower than for the high - mass smg counterparts .",
    "the low mass counterparts will not be able to become the high mass smg counterparts without additional infall of gas , and with episodic star formation spread out over several @xmath165 years .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the submm emission is not associated with the designated counterparts , but originates in a background source , which remains completely invisible at optical / nir wavelengths .",
    "star formation rates as well as dust and gas masses are inferred from the submm emission .",
    "it is found that the smgs constitutes a homogenous group in terms of their gas and dust properties , without showing the dichotomy seen in the stellar masses . except for the two low mass galaxies less 10 and less 34 , for which the baryonic mass appears to be dominated by molecular gas ,",
    "the molecular gas fraction is found to be @xmath528% .",
    "if the star formation rates , derived from model results , are correct , the typical gas consumption time scale for the smgs is short , only @xmath172myr , and unless the gas is replenished through accretion , the smgs can add @xmath173m@xmath4 of stars during the smg phase , leading to a final stellar mass of @xmath174m@xmath4 for the smg descendants .",

    "<S> the high angular resolution of the alma imaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the candels multiband dataset . </S>",
    "<S> the candels data provide deep photometric data from uv through near - infrared wavelengths . using synthetic spectral energy distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we derive photometric redshifts , stellar masses , extinction , ages , and the star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift range is z@xmath11.65 - 4.76 , with two of the galaxies located at z@xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> two smg counterparts have stellar masses 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than the rest . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining smg counterparts have stellar masses around @xmath3m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar population in the smgs is typically older than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase , suggesting that the star formation history of submillimeter galaxies is more complex than a single burst . </S>",
    "<S> non - parametric morphology indices suggest that the smg counterparts are among the most asymmetric systems compared with galaxies of the same stellar mass and redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the hst images shows that 3 of the smgs are associated with on - going mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining counterparts are isolated . </S>",
    "<S> estimating the dust and molecular gas mass from the submm fluxes , and comparing with our stellar masses shows that the gas mass fraction of smgs is @xmath528% and that the final stellar mass is likely to be @xmath6m@xmath4 . </S>"
