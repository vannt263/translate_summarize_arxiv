    "neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns - lmxbs ) are systems in which a low - magnetic - field neutron star accretes matter from a low - mass companion star through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "they display a wide range of x - ray spectral and variability properties , both as a class and as individual sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "based on their correlated x - ray spectral and rapid variability behavior , ns - lmxbs are commonly divided into two subclasses , the so - called z sources and the atoll sources @xcite , named after the shapes they trace out in x - ray color - color ( cd ) and hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) .",
    "the z sources have luminosities close to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath00.51@xmath1  or more ) , whereas atoll sources have luminosities in the range @xmath00.010.5@xmath1 .",
    "an example of the variety in shapes that is observed in the cd / hid tracks of the z and atoll subclasses is shown in figure [ fig : overview ] .",
    "the z source tracks typically show three branches , which from top to bottom are called the horizontal branch , the normal branch , and the flaring branch .",
    "based on the presence and orientation of these branches , the z sources can be further divided into the ` cyg - like ' z sources ( cyg x-2 , gx 51 , and gx 340 + 0 ) and the ` sco - like ' z sources ( sco x-1 , gx 17 + 2 , and gx 349 + 2 ) , with the former showing ` z'-shaped tracks in the hid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]a ) and the latter more ` @xmath2'-shaped tracks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]b , c ; see also @xcite ( hereafter h07 ) )",
    ". the atoll sources can show ` z'-shaped tracks as well ( fig.[fig : overview]g ) , although the individual branches are thought to have a different physical nature than the z source branches @xcite .",
    "the branches of the z - shaped atoll tracks are called , from top to bottom ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]g ) , the extreme island state , the island state , and the lower and upper banana branches ; these branches are also frequently referred to as the hard , transitional / intermediate , and soft states , respectively .",
    "the low - luminosity atolls are typically found in the ( extreme ) island state , whereas the high - luminosity ones tend to be found mainly on the ( upper ) banana branch ( fig .  [ fig : overview]d ) .",
    "in addition to motion along atoll or z branches , some sources also show changes in the shape and location of their tracks in the cd and hid , which is often referred to as secular motion .",
    "examples of this can be seen in figure [ fig : overview ] , with the horizontal branch of gx 17 + 2 and the upper - banana branches of gx 9 + 9 and 4u 173544 being traced out at varying intensity levels . much stronger secular motion can be found in the z source cyg x-2 @xcite , where it occasionally results in switches between cyg - like and sco - like z source behavior ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we note that transitions between the atoll ( extreme ) island state and the banana branches , and vice versa , often show strong hysteresis in hids , resulting in jumps between those branches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .",
    "[ fig : overview]f , g ) .",
    "it is not clear if and how this behavior is related to the secular motion .",
    "in addition to differences in x - ray luminositiy and cd / hid tracks , the ns - lmxbs subclasses also show differences in x - ray spectral and variability properties @xcite , radio behavior @xcite , as well as in the rate at which they show type i ( thermonuclear ) x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "this disparity in the properties between the subclasses was a long - standing problem in the understanding of the accretion processes in ns - lmxbs . while differences in the mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) could explain some of the variety in observed properties ( e.g. , in x - ray luminosity and bursting behavior ) , it was unclear if one could link the wide variety in cd / hid tracks , rapid variability , and broadband spectral properties through changes in @xmath3  alone .",
    "additional parameters have been proposed to explain some of the observed differences , not only between z and atoll subclasses , but also between the cyg - like and sco - like z sources : magnetic field strength and viewing angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "testing for the necessity of such additional parameters is complicated by the fact that none of the classical z sources has been observed to venture into the atoll luminosity range ( and vice versa ) . until recently only two sources were suspected to have made a transition between z - like and atoll - like behavior : cir x-1 and xte j1806246 (= 2s 1803245 ) .",
    "cir x-1 was found to show z - like properties at high luminosities @xcite and atoll - like properties at low luminosities @xcite .",
    "xte j1806246 showed some characteristics of z sources near the peak of its outburst , which reached @xmath0@xmath1   ( other bright ns - lmxb transients typically only reach @xmath00.5@xmath1 ) , and atoll properties at lower luminosities @xcite . while these two examples suggested that a single source can show atoll / z source characteristics depending on luminosity , and lent some credence to the belief that the ns - lmxb subclasses are entirely the result of differences in @xmath3 , the actual evolution from z tracks to atoll tracks had never been observed .",
    "significant progress on the issue of ns - lmxb subclasses was gained following the outburst of xte j1701462 , a transient ns - lmxb that was discovered in january 2006 @xcite and remained in outburst for @xmath019 months .",
    "initial observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ revealed that xte j1701462  was the first transient ns - lmxb to show all of the z source characteristics in x - rays ( h07 ) .",
    "the radio properties of the source were consistent with those of the z sources as well @xcite .",
    "observations of type i x - ray bursts with radius expansion , near the end of the outburst , put the source at a distance of 8.8@xmath41.3 kpc and indicate that during the early phase of the outburst the source had super - eddington luminosities @xcite . after the early phase of the outburst the source made a transition from cyg - like to sco - like z source behavior as the source intensity dropped by a factor of 1.5 ( h07 ) , and observations near the end of the outburst , in july 2007 , showed the source evolving from sco - like z source behavior to atoll source behavior @xcite .",
    "a full spectral analysis of the entire outburst was performed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter lrh09 ) , who confirm that at the lowest luminosities the spectral behavior of xte j1701462  is consistent with that observed for the two atoll source transients aql x-1 and 4u 160852 @xcite .",
    "xte j1701462   is the first source in which the evolution from z to atoll source has been observed in detail , and",
    "its behavior strongly suggests that different levels of @xmath3  are indeed sufficient to explain the different ns - lmxb subclasses .",
    "the outburst of xte j1701462  also allows for a study of the evolution of the x - ray properties along cd / hid tracks within the context of the different ns - lmxb subclasses .",
    "this may shed new light on the nature of the z and atoll branches , whether some or all are unique to each class , and , most importantly , what drives the motion along them .",
    "as far as atoll sources are concerned , past observations of transient ns - lmxbs have suggested that the evolution along atoll source cd / hid tracks is mainly driven by variations in @xmath3  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increasing from the extreme island state to the upper banana branch .",
    "however , the aforementioned hysteresis in spectral state transitions @xcite and parallel tracks observed in hids ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) hint at a more complex relation between @xmath3  and spectral state in atoll sources @xcite , not unlike what is suggested by the spectral evolution seen in transient black - hole x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there is ambiguity in some of these discussions about the definition of @xmath3 .",
    "some authors implicity define @xmath3  as the mass transfer rate from the companion to the compact object roche lobe , while others take the mass flow rate through the inner disk or the accretion rate onto the neutron star surface as the more relevant definition .",
    "others explicitly distinguish various @xmath3  components . in the presence of the various proposed flows in the accretion / ejection process , such as disk and equatorial boundary layer flows ,",
    "spherical inflows , magnetically dominated polar flows , possible disk winds and jets , clearly this is a complex issue to which we shall return in  [ sec : discussion ] .    interpreting the evolution along the z source tracks",
    "has been more difficult , owing to the fact that motion along the z source tracks corresponds to relatively small ( less than a factor of @xmath02 ) and non - monotonic intensity variations . for z sources",
    "it was suggested that @xmath3  increases from the horizontal branch to the flaring branch @xcite , although other scenarios have been put forward as well : e.g. , @xmath3  changing in the opposite direction @xcite , or @xmath3  not changing at all @xcite .",
    "based on their spectral analysis of the z tracks , lrh09 suggest that motion along the z tracks may occur at a nearly constant @xmath3 , with the branches being the result of different instabilities in the near-@xmath1  accretion flow .",
    "more detailed analyses of the data presented in this work , dealing with different aspects of xte j1701462 , can be found in a number of other papers : spectral analysis ( lrh09 ) , type - i x - ray bursts @xcite , khz qpos @xcite , broad - band variability ( aresu et al .  2010 , in prep . ) , and the rapid decay into quiescence @xcite . here ,",
    "we present an overview of the outburst of xte j1701462  that focuses on aspects of the evolution of xte j1701462  in which the change from z source to atoll source is most clearly seen : the cd / hid tracks , high - frequency qpos , and broad - band variability . in particular",
    ", we find that selections of data groups based on low - energy count rate allow for a more detailed study of the evolution of the cd / hid tracks than in h07 and lrh09 .",
    "this also permits a more precise comparison of the observed tracks for xte j1701462  with those found in the various ns - lmxb sub - classes . in  [ sec : data ] we summarize our data set and analysis techniques .",
    "our results are presented in  [ sec : results ] and in  [ sec : discussion ] these results are interpreted and discussed within the framework of various scenarios for the role of @xmath3  in driving the evolution between ns - lmxb subclasses and along the cd / hid tracks of ns - lmxbs .",
    "we analyzed all 865 pointed _ rxte _",
    "@xcite observations of xte j1701462  made between 2006 january 19 ( mjd 53754 ) and 2007 aug 29 ( mjd 54341 ) .",
    "five of them were discarded from further analysis because proportional counter unit 2 ( pcu2 ) was not working or because the length of usable data intervals was too short ( @xmath5256s ) for our variability analysis .",
    "the remaining 860 observations had a total combined exposure time of @xmath02.73 ms .",
    "for our analysis we only made use of data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we followed the same analysis steps as described in h07 , the only difference being that in addition to background corrections , the standard-2 data used for the light curves and cds / hids in  [ sec : lc - cd ] were also corrected for dead time .",
    "all count rates and colors given in the text and used in the figures are for pcu2 only ; for our power spectral analysis we made use of all active pcus .",
    "dates will be referred to as days since 2006 january 19 ( mjd 53754 ) .",
    "in figure [ fig : lc ] we plot _ rxte_/pca light curves of xte j1701462  in two energy bands : @xmath022.9 kev and @xmath09.418.1 kev , corresponding to standard-2 channels 13 and 2040 , respectively .",
    "the two light curves have a strikingly different appearance . except for the first 30 days of the outburst and occasional short drops in intensity between days 30 and 130 ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc]a ) , the low - energy light curve shows little short - term variability .",
    "smooth long - term modulations with periods of @xmath02050 days are present , until the source starts its descent into quiescence .",
    "the high - energy light curve , on the other hand , shows strong short - term flaring , which , as we discuss later , corresponds mostly to motion along the z source flaring branch .",
    "this flaring starts to weaken around the time at which the long - term low - energy modulations end , and it abruptly subsides when the decay at low energies accelerates ( day @xmath0550 ) . after day @xmath0560 , the count rates reach a very low , but non - zero , level of @xmath02 ctss@xmath6 per pcu ( full energy band ) .",
    "this residual emission can be attributed to diffuse galactic emission @xcite , but has not been subtracted from our data .",
    "the times of the three type i x - ray bursts that were detected near the end of the outburst @xcite are indicated by the short vertical lines in figure [ fig : lc ] .    as shown by h07 and lrh09 ,",
    "xte j1701462  displays strong secular changes in its cd and hid . creating a single cd",
    "/ hid for the entire outburst results in a complicated set of overlapping tracks with varying shapes ( see , e.g. , figure 6 in lrh09 ) .",
    "time - based selections , such as the ones made by h07 and lrh09 , also encounter strong secular motion associated with the 2050 day modulations , which causes the shape and position of the tracks to change on a time scale of a few days .",
    "fortunately , we have found that the low - energy count rate ( 22.9 kev ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc]a ) appears to be a fairly good tracer of the secular changes . for most of the outburst",
    ", the count rate in this band changes very little as the source traces out a particular z track ( although it does change along the atoll track we observed at the end of the outburst ) .",
    "furthermore , the low - energy count rate can be used to make separate cds and hids based on count rate intervals selected over most of the outburst .",
    "eleven low - energy count rate intervals were defined to group the cd / hid data points ; the maximum values of these intervals are shown as horizontal lines on the right - hand side of figure [ fig : lc]a . although the goal of these selections is to follow the secular evolution of the cd / hid tracks , there are two cases where changes in the low - energy count rate were mainly the result of motion along the cd / hid track .",
    "the first case concerns the period before day 29 , during the cyg - like z source stage of the outburst , when the source shows large intensity swings in the low energy band , associated with motion along the z. for this period we manually selected data to create two sets of cds / hids ( bringing the number of cd / hid selections to a total of thirteen ) ; the first period consists of data from days 14.023.0 , corresponding to the highest observed count rates , and the second combines data from days 014.0 and 23.029.0 .",
    "the second case where we experienced difficulties with the low - energy countrate selections consists of several occasions when the source enters the horizontal branch _ after _ day 29 .",
    "these instances are marked in red in figure [ fig : lc ] and many are clearly visible as drops in count rate near the maxima of the long - term modulations , as the result of which they end up in a lower count rate selection . to correct for this , these data points were grouped with their neighbouring non - horizontal branch observations ( typically one count rate level higher ) .",
    "twelve of the thirteen cds and hids are shown in figures [ fig : cd ] and [ fig : hid ] , respectively , in order of decreasing low - energy count rate .",
    "the average _ total _ count rate of the tracks decreases ( monotonically ) in the same direction as well .",
    "the twelve cds and hids will be referred to as selections a - l throughout the remainder of the paper . except for observations with low - energy count rates below 0.4 ctss@xmath6 ( i.e. , the thirteenth count rate interval ) , which have data with large errors bars , these selections represent our entire _ rxte _  data set of xte j1701462 .",
    "the count rate intervals used for each cd / hid are shown near the bottom of each panel , except for selections a and b , which were based on manual selections and had peak low - energy count rates of @xmath0100165 ctss@xmath6 .",
    "the total amount of time in each selection is shown as well .",
    "the horizontal branch observations marked with red data points in the light curves in figure [ fig : lc ] are shown in red in figure [ fig : cd ] as well .",
    "compared to the cds shown in lrh09 , which were based on broad time selections , the set of cds shown in figure [ fig : cd ] reveals a more detailed evolution of the cd tracks .",
    "we note that the ordering of the panels in figures [ fig : cd ] and [ fig : hid ] does not reflect the evolution of the source as a function of time ; as can be seen in figure [ fig : lc]a , xte j1701462  moved back and forth between different selections ( c  h ) for most of the outburst .",
    "while our low - energy count rate intervals result in relatively narrow cd tracks , there is still considerable secular motion within some of the hid tracks , making it harder to follow the evolution of these tracks than in the cds . for this reason we created subset hids from narrower count rate selections within selections d  k , which are shown in red in figure [ fig : hid ] .",
    "significant evolution can be seen in the shape of the cd / hid tracks .",
    "it has already been reported that the cd / hid tracks of xte j1701462  evolved from cyg - like z tracks , to sco - like z tracks , and finally into atoll - like tracks ( h07 , * ? ? ? * lrh09 ) , which can clearly be seen in figures [ fig : cd ] and [ fig : hid ] .",
    "typical z and atoll branches have been marked in a few of the panels of figure [ fig : cd ] . in the following",
    "we take a more in - depth look at the evolution of the cd / hid tracks and also compare the cd / hid tracks of xte j1701462  to those found in other ns - lmxbs .",
    "to put the evolution of the cd / hid tracks of xte j1701462  into a broader context , we compare the various cd / hid tracks observed in xte j1701462  with those seen in other ns - lmxbs . for this comparison",
    "we mainly refer to work that is based on _",
    "rxte_/pca data , as comparison with data from other satellites is complicated by differences in energy bands and instrument responses .",

    "moreover , in gx 51 and gx 340 + 0 the count rate increases when they move onto the flaring branch ( at least up to the ` dipping ' flaring branch ) , whereas the count rate decreases strongly on the flaring branch in selections a and b. such dramatic drops in intensity on the flaring branch have only been seen in cyg x-2 during its high luminosity state .",

    "what follows is a brief overview of the most significant aspects in the evolution of the cd / hid tracks and branches .    the horizontal branch in the high - intensity and cyg - like selections a and b shows large intensity swings that only results in minor color changes .",
    "selections a and b are also the only two selections to show an extension to the horizontal branch that previously has been referred to as the horizontal branch ` upturn ' ( h07 , lrh09 ) . in the cd",
    "this upturn appears to be more of a separate branch than in the hid , similar to what is seen in gx 5 - 1 and in the _ exosat _ data of cyg x-2 @xcite .",
    "the horizontal branch is not observed in selection c , probably due to the short total exposure time . in the cds of selections",
    "d - f the orientation of the horizontal branch is rotated in a clockwise direction with respect to selections a and b , while the intensity swings have become less pronounced . the upturn is no longer present in these selections , and the horizontal branch itself is no longer visible in selection g.    the normal branch gradually becomes shorter in the cds and hids from selection a to h , while it rotates slightly in a counter - clockwise direction . as in the case of the horizontal branch",
    ", the shortening of the normal branch in the hid means that the intensity swings become less pronounced .",
    "the normal branch is only marginally detected in selection i. as was already pointed out by h07 , the vertex between the normal and flaring branches moved along a more or less straight line in the cd during the first part of the outburst , as the result of the secular changes .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : cd ] , where we have represented the path of the vertex with a dashed line , this also appears to be true for the remainder of the z source phase of the outburst .",
    "lrh09 showed that this vertex also followed a straight line in their hid . with our color definition",
    "( i.e. , chosen energy bands ) the path followed by the vertex in our hid shows some deviations from a straight line ( especially in the three highest count rate selections ) , but it is still rather close .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : hid ] represents the approximate path of the vertex ; it is a straight line , but it appears curved because of the logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis .",
    "the flaring branch undergoes large changes in both the cd and hid and is crucial in linking z and atoll source behavior . in selections a and b motion onto the flaring branch corresponds to drops in the intensity , and in the hid",
    "the flaring branch appears to be an extension of the normal branch . in the cd of selection",
    "a the flaring branch points downward , but it rotates in a counter - clockwise direction in the lower count rate selections . starting in selection c , motion onto the flaring branch corresponds to count rate increases , which become more pronounced in selections e and f. this flaring eventually starts to become weaker ( see also the high - energy light curve in figure [ fig : lc]b ) , but it remains present through selection k. while selections j and k can be classified as atoll - like (  [ sec : comparison ] ) , it is important to note that the flaring that has long been regarded as being characteristic of the sco - like z sources is still present in these lower count rate intervals . in the framework of atoll sources , the branches traced out as a result of this flaring would be referred to as the atoll upper - banana branch , but as figures [ fig : lc ] , [ fig : cd ] , and [ fig : hid ] show , there is no sharp transition between z and atoll behavior . to better describe the rapid evolution during the last phase of the outburst and",

    "points on the upper - banana branch of the atoll in the cd were colored red ; from the hid and light curve it can be seen that these upper - banana branch data points correspond to the last few flares that were observed in xte j1701462  ( compare also with figs .  [",
    "fig : lc]b and [ fig : hid ] ) .",
    "this is the first time that the z source flaring branch has been observed to evolve into the atoll source upper banana branch and it confirms earlier suspicions @xcite that the two branches might be one and the same phenomenon .",
    "the lower banana branch starts to form around the time of the last flares in selections j and k. as the total count rate drops by a factor of @xmath03 from selection k to selection l , the source moves away from the diagonal line followed by ( the secular motion of ) the normal / flaring branch vertex in selections a to i ( dashed lines in fig .

    "it is followed by the extreme - island state , in which the hard color becomes more or less constant ( although poorly constrained because of the low count rates ) .",

    "the count 22.9 kev rate initially goes down rapidly , which is linked to the rapid cyg - like to sco - like transition ; later it goes up and down superimposed on the gradual decay , and this is associated with the source moving back and forth between subclasses .",
    "we interpret the 22.9 kev count rate as a proxy for the mass accretion rate component @xmath3 , possibly that from outer disk to the inner parts of the accretion flow , that determines subclass .",

    "the fact that the only three detections of type i x - ray bursts were made in the atoll phase of the outburst is in line with the fact that atoll sources are more prolific bursters than z sources @xcite , and further supports our identification of the final phase of the outburst as atoll - like . @xcite",

    "moreover , except for sources that suffer from high internal absorption ( i.e. , dipping and/or eclipsing sources ) , we are not aware of sources that show cd / hid tracks that are wildly different from the ones seen in xte j1701462 .",
    "this seems to suggest that the evolution of the tracks seen in xte j1701462  is representative of the entire class of ns - lmxbs , which we will further explore in an upcoming paper ( fridriksson et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . ) .",
    "the gradual transition from sco - like z to atoll behavior observed in xte j1701462  argues against a sharply defined boundary between these two ns - lmxb subclasses .",
    "in particular , the flaring that is apparent in the high - energy light curves of xte j1701462  persists across the z / atoll periods of the outburst , as it is responsible for both the z source flaring branch _ and _ the atoll source upper banana branch .",
    "this flaring rapidly becomes weaker in the atoll phase , where it eventually subsides around a luminosity of @xmath00.15@xmath1  (  [ sec : evolution ] ; luminosity taken from lrh09 ) .",
    "in addition to the disappearance of the flaring , there are two additional points in the evolution of xte j1701462  at which significant changes occur ; one is the transition from cyg - like to sco - like z behavior around @xmath1 , and the other is the switch between thermal- and non - thermal - dominated spectra ( lower banana / island state transition ) around 0.02@xmath1  ( lrh09 ) .",
    "while these points could serve as ` natural ' boundaries between different types of ns - lmxb subclasses , there are a number of persistent ns - lmxbs that regularly cross one or more of these boundaries , so their usefulness for ( re-)defining ns - lmxb subclasses is therefore somewhat limited .    as already mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] , the disparity in the properties of the z and atoll subclasses has been a long - standing problem : are differences in mass accretion rate alone sufficient to explain the differences in the phenomenology of the various subclasses , or are additional parameters needed ?",
    "differences in the neutron - star magnetic field have been suggested to be ( partially ) responsible for the differences between z and atoll sources @xcite and between cyg - like and sco - like z sources @xcite .",
    "diamagnetic screening by accreted matter @xcite appears to be the only feasible way to affect ( i.e. reduce ) the external magnetic field of a neutron star on a short time scale .",
    "it can not explain the existence of two classes of z sources in terms of different magnetic field strengths , since fields in these sources should be completely buried as the result of their near - eddington accretion rates . explaining the z to atoll transition is problematic as well .",
    "@xcite suggested that atoll sources have a higher magnetic field than z sources and to explain the observed z to atoll transition , the underlying magnetic field needs to emerge again .",
    "however , the time scale on which this is expected to happen is much longer ( 1001000 yr ) than the observed time scale for the transition from z to atoll in xte j1701462 .",
    "we therefore conclude that magnetic field strength is probably not responsible for the nsxbs subclasses .",
    "differences in viewing angle have been proposed to explain the existence of two types of z sources , cyg - like and sco - like ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "changes in the binary inclination are not expected on the time scale of weeks to months , so these can be ruled out as a source for the observed transitions between subclasses in xte j1701462 .",
    "however , a tilted precessing disk , such as thought to be present in , e.g. , cyg x-2 @xcite , can lead to changes in the viewing geometry on a time scale of weeks to months . combined with the effects of anisotropies and/or varying amounts of obscuration",
    "this could lead to changes in the morphology of cd / hid tracks and branches .",
    "however , such a model would require a complex evolution of the viewing angle to account for the observed sequence ( in time ) of the various sub - classes .",
    "moreover , it can not account for the systematic disappearance of the various z source branches as is observed during the transition from z to atoll .",
    "we conclude that viewing angle is probably also not responsible for the nsxb subclasses .",
    "we note that parameters such as neutron star mass and spin frequency should not change substantially during an outburst , as the amount of matter that is accreted is negligible in comparison to the neutron star mass .    given the above , and taking also into consideration the transient nature of xte j1701462 , we conclude that transitions between the ns - lmxb subclasses in xte j1701462  are probably entirely driven by changes in @xmath3 .",
    "although we can not completely rule out that the persistent z and atoll sources differ in , e.g. , neutron star mass / spin / magnetic field , or viewing angle , our results indicate that these parameters are relatively unimportant to the phenomenology of xte j1701462 , and by extension , to that of the z and atoll sources .",
    "such parameters may , however , explain some of the differences between tracks in the cd / hids of sources with similar @xmath3 .",
    "the discussion of the role of the various possible inflow / outflow components of the accretion process in determining ns - lmxb subclasses and motion along the cd / hid tracks is of course hampered by the lack of reliable independent measures of the relevant inflow / outflow rates , so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions , even from the rich phenomenology observed in xte j1701462 .",
    "however , as we discussed above , for most of the outburst of xte j1701462  the low - energy count rate appears to be a fairly good tracer of the @xmath3  that determines the changes in the cd / hid tracks .",
    "it is plausible that this @xmath3  scales monotonically with some overall representative average pcu2 ( @xmath0260 kev ) count rate level of the cd / hid tracks and their average bolometric luminosities ( lrh09 ) . under certain assumptions",
    "this would imply that cyg - like z source behavior corresponds to the highest overall energy release and perhaps @xmath3  values , followed by sco - like z source behavior and then atoll source behavior .",
    "the above also implies that the horizontal branch and its upturn are phenomena related to the highest @xmath3  values , although , as we discuss below , this does not necessarily mean that along a single z track these parts of the track represent the highest values of the accretion rate relevant to motion along the z.      the above interpretation in which an @xmath3  level determines the type of cd / hid track of ns lmxbs has implications for proposed models for the role of mass flow rates in motion ( i.e. spectral evolution ) along the z tracks .",
    "such a picture is obviously problematic for models in which the same @xmath3  level that determines the type of cd / hid also directly determines the position along the z , with this @xmath3  either increasing monotonically from the horizontal to the flaring branch @xcite , as is still often assumed , or with @xmath3  changing in the opposite direction , as was recently proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out that the accretion rate through some part of the inner accretion flow changes monotonically along the z.    a suggested solution in which changes in a mass flow rate can explain both the changes in the type of the cd / hid tracks as well as motion along the z track was discussed in h07 .",
    "their solution was based on a model by @xcite for the so - called ` parallel tracks ' phenomenon in ns - lmxbs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for further information on this ) , which assumes that there exists both a prompt and a filtered response to changes in the mass accretion rate @xmath3@xmath15 through the inner edge of the accretion disk . for a detailed discussion of the filtered response scenario and how it relates to motion along the z we refer to h07 , but we point out an opportunity and a problem here .",
    "the model predicts that branches would be preferentially suppressed if there is a prolonged monotonic decay in @xmath16 , which is somewhat reminiscent of the systematic disappearance of the z source horizontal and normal branches .",
    "however , the observed long term modulation in 22.9 kev flux is not monotonic , and if it can be identified with @xmath16  it should alternatingly suppress the horizontal and the flaring branch , which is not observed .",
    "an alternative scenario , in which motion along the z track is not governed by @xmath3 , was suggested by @xcite . in such a scenario",
    "the parameter(s ) responsible for spectral and variability properties , e.g. , the inner disk radius , varies ( vary ) independently from @xmath3 .",
    "the spectral fits by lrh09 suggest that motion along the horizontal branch and the sco - like flaring branch is consistent with occurring at a nearly constant @xmath3 , although this is not as clear for the normal branch and cyg - like flaring branch . in any case , the spectral fits suggest that @xmath3  variations along individual z tracks are very small .",
    "based on this , lrh09 suggest that the different z branches may be the result of various instabilities in the accretion flow , which could be related to an increase in the radiation pressure in different parts of the flow ( inner disk , boundary layer ) .",
    "this scenario avoids the difficulties of @xmath3  having to explain both gradual changes in the shape of the z tracks and motion along the z track at the same time .",
    "the observations of xte j1701462  require that the occurrence of the assumed ( and unknown ) instabilities themselves depends on the @xmath3  level ( i.e. , the instabilities resulting in the horizontal and normal branches only being present at the highest @xmath3 ) , but the proposed scenario provides no explanation for the systematic suppression of horizontal and normal branches as 22.9 kev count rate drops .",
    "the above discussion has mostly focused on the role of @xmath3  in the z source tracks . as already mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] , motion along atoll tracks appears to be mostly the result of changes in @xmath3 .",
    "the spectral fits by lrh09 support this . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to point to the atoll lower - banana branch in the hid of xte j1701462 , which appears to be a continuation of the presumably @xmath3  driven secular motion observed in the z - like phase of the outburst .",
    "however , the presence of hysteresis in the state transitions @xcite and the phenomenon of parallel tracks @xcite observed in other atoll ns - lmxbs suggest that a time averaged response to changes in @xmath3  might be involved as well @xcite .",
    "the luminosity range over which khz qpos are detected in xte j1701462  spans a factor of @xmath01520 , which is wider than seen in any other ns - lmxb @xcite .",
    "however , there is a fairly large gap in luminosity in which no khz qpos are detected , corresponding to selections g  k . in selections g and",
    "h the source shows sco - like z behavior , but is missing the horizontal and upper normal branches , where most of the khz qpo detections in the sco - like z sources are made ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the behavior of xte j1701462  in selections i  k is similar to that of the bright atoll sources gx 9 + 9 , gx 9 + 1 , and gx 3 + 1 , for which no khz qpos have been reported either ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "surprisingly , we did not detect khz qpos in the cyg - like z selections , despite the fact that all three persistent cyg - like z sources have shown khz qpos @xcite . as pointed out in  [ sec : comparison ] , however , selections a and b also show some differences from the cyg - like z sources in terms of cd / hid structure .",
    "selection c is missing its horizontal branch , on which most khz qpo detections were made in the cyg - like z sources .",
    "finally , the fact that the z - source - like and atoll - source - like khz qpos in xte j1701462  are well separated in luminosity and have distinct properties ( such as q - value and rms amplitudes ) suggests that they might be the result of different excitation mechanisms , not only in xte j1701462 but also in other z and atoll sources .",
    "quasi - periodic long - term variability has been observed in numerous lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the long - term modulations seen in the low - energy light curve of xte j1701462  are closely related to the gradual changes in the cd / hid tracks of the source , and we therefore suggest that they are the result of changes in @xmath3 .",
    "they are only seen at intermediate luminosities ( not at the peak of the outburst or during the decay ) . to study the time dependence of the long - term modulations we created a dynamical power spectrum of the long - term low - energy light curve (",
    "see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by combining lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite of 75-day intervals , with the start dates of the intervals shifting by five days .",
    "the resulting dynamic power spectrum reveals that the period of the long - term modulations varies between @xmath02050 days .",
    "given the strong variations in their period , the long - term variations are probably not the result of orbital modulations .",
    "we also note that the sharp dips that are present near the maxima of the first few cycles are not related to the absorption events that are often seen in high - inclination lmxbs ; here they are the result of spectral changes associated with the source entering the horizontal branch .",
    "the lack of a known orbital period for xte j1701462  complicates the interpretation of the long - term modulations , although , given the brightness and duration of the outburst , the orbital period of xte j1701462  is likely to be on the order of days or longer ( h07 ) .",
    "accretion disk precession as the result of radiation - induced warping has been suggested as a source for long - term modulation in some lmxbs @xcite , although such modulations are usually discussed in terms of changes in viewing angle or obscuration ( which we rule out as a source of subclass transitions in xte j1701462- see  [ sec : nature ] ) .",
    "although not explicitly discussed in these works , a precessing warped disc could perhaps also result in actual modulations in @xmath3 , as the result of varying torques from the secondary .",
    "two ns lmxbs have shown modulations that may be relevant to the discussion of the long - term variations in xte j1701462 .",
    "@xcite report on modulations with a period of @xmath040 days in the ns lmxb 4u 163653 .",
    "these modulations are accompanied by transitions between the island state and lower banana branch ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are therefore likely the result of modulations in @xmath3 .",
    "similar to xte j1701462 , the modulations in 4u 163653 were not present at every luminosity level ; they only appeared after the long - term average luminosity of the source had shown a decrease .",
    "@xcite argue that such a decrease could lower the irradiation of the outer accretion disc , resulting in a drop in its temperature and possibly bringing it into a regime of unstable accretion that results in limit cycle behavior .",
    "based on the length and luminosity of its outburst , xte j1701462  is expected to have an orbital period on the order of days or more ( h07 ) , which is longer than 4u 163653 ( 3.8 hrs ) .",
    "presumably , it therefore also has a larger accretion disc , which means that the onset of such an instability could already occur at a higher luminosity , in line with what we observe for xte j1701462 .",
    "the long - term modulations in cyg x-2 @xcite are accompanied by strong changes between various types of z tracks @xcite , similar to what we observe in xte j1701462 .",
    "although the modulations in cyg x-2 appear to be less regular than in xte j1701462 , @xcite find that the lengths of the modulations cycles in cyg x-2 are consistent with being integer multiples ( 114 ) of the 9.843 day orbital period of the system @xcite .",
    "the outburst of xte j1701462  has revealed in great detail the evolution of a low - magnetic field ns - lmxb from near- or super - eddington rates all the way down to quiescence .",
    "most interestingly , xte j1701462  was observed to transform from a cyg - like z source to a sco - like z source at high luminosities , and from sco - like z to atoll source at low luminosties .",
    "a brief comparison with other ns - lmxbs suggests that the behavior observed in xte j1701462  is representative of the entire class of low - magnetic field ns - lmxbs .",
    "we conclude that these transformations between ns - lmxb subclasses are the result of changes in a mass accretion rate component @xmath3  ( which for most of the outburst is measured by the 22.9 kev count rate ) and argue that differences in neutron star spin / mass / magnetic field or viewing angle are of minor importance to the z / atoll phenomenology .",
    "the evolution observed within the z source phase of the outburst shows a surprising evolution of the z source tracks , with the horizontal , normal , and flaring branches disappearing one - by - one as @xmath3  appears to decrease .",
    "this is at odds with scenarios in which the same @xmath3  component increases or decreases monotonically from the horizontal to the flaring branch .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath3  responsible for the subclasses does not vary significantly along the z tracks , while it does along atoll tracks . motion along z tracks may instead be the result of instabilities , whose presence _ does _ depend on @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we report on an analysis of rxte data of the transient neutron star low - mass x - ray binary ( ns - lmxb ) xte j1701 - 462 , obtained during its 2006 - 2007 outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray properties of the source changed between those of various types of ns - lmxb subclasses . at high luminosities </S>",
    "<S> the source switched between two types of z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from z source to atoll source behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions between subclasses primarily manifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in x - ray color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams , but they are accompanied by changes in the khz quasi - periodic oscillations , broad - band variability , burst behavior , and/or x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the low - energy x - ray flux is a good parameter to track the gradual evolution of the tracks in color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams , allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail than before and relate the observed properties to other ns - lmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that during the transition from z to atoll , characteristic behavior known as the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of a weakening z source flaring branch , thereby blurring the line between the two subclasses . </S>",
    "<S> our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behavior observed in ns - lxmbs with different luminosities can be linked through changes in a single variable parameter , namely the mass accretion rate , without the need for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewing angle . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectral changes observed in ns lmxbs and suggest that , contrary to what is often assumed , the position along the color - color tracks of z sources is not determined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate . </S>"
