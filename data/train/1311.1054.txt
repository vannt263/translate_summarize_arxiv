    "triply charged oxygen ion ( o iv ) belongs to the boron isoelectronic sequence , its ground state configuration is 2s@xmath3 2p @xmath3p@xmath4 .",
    "the boron like ions are widely observed in a variety of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "many researchers have been done a lot of calculations for many parameters of o iv due to its importance in astrophysical plasma .",
    "@xcite calculated energy levels , radiative rates ( a values ) and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( gamma ) which are obtained from the electron impact collision strength ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite presented a solar coronal spectrum recorded by the extreme uv spectrometer sumer on the solar and heliospheric observatory .",
    "the detected o iv lines covered the wavelength range 500 - 1610  .",
    "the studied range contains the 2s@xmath3 2p @xmath3p@xmath4 -2s 2p@xmath3 @xmath6p intercombination transitions . @xcite",
    "obtained a high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of rr tel at medium resolution with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to test available atomic data for the intercombination transitions in o iv ( multiplet : uv 0.01 ) .",
    "@xcite observed the far - ultraviolet spectrum of the cygnus loop supernova remnant using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope aboard the astro-1 space shuttle .",
    "similarly , @xcite have been detected lines of o iv in late - type stars within the wavelength range of 910 - 1180  .",
    "@xcite studied emission lines of o iv in ir range from active galactic nuclei and @xcite observed them in the solar transition region .",
    "@xcite generated theoretical uv and extreme - uv emission line ratio for o iv and presented their strong versatility for diagnostics of electron temperature and electron density for astrophysical plasmas .",
    "extreme - ultraviolet lines emission arising from radiative transition probabilities and electron collision cross - sections in b - like ions were calculated by @xcite .",
    "using semiclassical approach , @xcite calculated electron- , proton- , and he iii - impact line widths and shifts for 5 multiplets of o iv .",
    "the widths , shifts and fitting coefficients data are in the database stark - b @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the non - equilibrium ionization effects on the line ratio of o iv .    in this work , we will study the influence of the atomic data on the emission line ratio i(1407.1 )/i(1401.1  ) .",
    "in this work , energy levels and oscillator strengths are calculated with the hartree - fock relativistic ( hfr ) approach using cowan code @xcite and an atomic model including the 13-configurations : 2s@xmath3 2p , 2s 2p@xmath3 , 2p@xmath7 , 2s@xmath3 3s , 2s@xmath3 3p , 2s@xmath3 3d , 2s@xmath3 4s , 2s@xmath3 4p , 2s@xmath3 4d , 2s@xmath3 4f , 2s 2p 3s , 2s 2p 3p and 2s 2p 3d .",
    "the obtained energy level data are compared in table 1 with those of nist @xcite , grasp2 @xcite ( using 219 levels ) and mchf @xcite .    the spontaneous emission radiative rate ( the so - called einstein s a - coefficient ) , @xmath8 is related with the absorption oscillator strength @xmath9 for the transition @xmath10 by the standard relation :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the transition energy between states @xmath13 and @xmath14 in rydberg units , @xmath15 is the fine structure constant and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the statistical weight factors of the initial and final states respectively .",
    "the transition probability in s@xmath18 is then :    @xmath19    with @xmath20 = 2.4191 @xmath21 @xmath22 is the atomic unit of time .    in table 2 , we have compared our values of log(@xmath23 ) and transition probability @xmath24s@xmath25 with the values taken from nist database @xcite and results from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "observed wavelengths are from @xcite .",
    "the excitation rate coefficient in @xmath26s@xmath18 can be expressed by the effective collision strength as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the effective collision strength related to the collision strength @xmath29 by :    @xmath30    the excitation rate coefficient @xmath31 can also be written as a function of the cross - section :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the threshold velocity and @xmath34 is the maxwellian velocity distribution function for electrons .    the semiclassical cross - section @xmath35 can be expressed by an integral over the impact parameter @xmath36 of the transition probability @xmath37 as    @xmath38    @xmath39 is the debye radius and @xmath40 is the minimum cut - off radius ( see @xcite , and @xcite for neutrals ) .",
    "in a steady state regime , we can write that :    @xmath41 \\\\",
    "% \\end{array } % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the number of ions per unit of volume for the energy level @xmath13 , @xmath31 is the electron collisional rate for transferring ions from level @xmath13 to level @xmath14 , and @xmath44 is the collisional rate for transferring ions from level @xmath14 to level @xmath13 . in fact , since the local incident radiation is very weak , absorption and induced emission rates are completely negligible compared to collisional rates .",
    "so , for transferring ions from level @xmath13 to level @xmath14 ( or from level @xmath14 to level @xmath13 ) by radiative processes , only spontaneous emission rates @xmath45 ( or @xmath8 ) are to be taken into account .    solving the above set of equations , we obtain the relative populations @xmath46 for any two levels .",
    "the normalization is obtained by the constraint @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ion density per unit volume .",
    "the local emissivity in the line studied ( in units of energy , per unit of volume , per unit of time , and per steradian ) for a transition from state @xmath14 to state @xmath13 is given by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the planck constant , and @xmath51 the frequency of the transition .",
    "in  mode 1 \" of @xcite , the observed intensity ratio of two lines is equal to the relevant line emissivity ratio .",
    "this is currently assumed in uv coronal studies , and justified when the two lines are formed in the same region of the plasma , and in addition if the emissivities vary slowly in the regions of emission . as @xcite",
    ", we will assume that it is the case for the considered o iv lines .",
    "@xcite studied the line ratio i(1407.3 )/i(1401.1  ) versus electron density for constant electron temperatures .",
    "they used the @xcite energy values in their calculations .",
    "the radiative transition probabilities are taken from different sources cited in their paper and from @xcite for the excitation rates .    in our present work ,",
    "we have used our own calculated energies and oscillator strengths ( hfr calculations ) that give more self - consistent data . for the collision strengths",
    ", we have interpolated linearly the 3 collision strengths given by @xcite for the energies 2.8 , 4.2 and 5.6 ry",
    ".    then our atomic energy levels , oscillator strengths and interpolation of the collision strengths have been introduced in the statistical equilibrium code of @xcite that we have modified to give the intensities calculated both as photons emitted and as energy emitted versus electron density for a given electron temperature .",
    "we have not taken into account the collisions with protons .",
    "in fact , our purpose is to study the effect on the behavior of the line ratio using different atomic data from different sources .",
    "putting different energy levels from different sources have not changed the behavior of the curve but when different oscillator strengths have been used , there is a change .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the line ratio that we obtain when using the oscillator strengths from @xcite ( solid curve ) and when putting our hfr data ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the difference is increasing with the electron density to reach 14% for @xmath52 .",
    "we generally used our own energy levels and oscillator strengths for calculating stark widths and shifts of spectral lines in our previous articles . in the present work ,",
    "we have introduced cross sections , which are a part of the stark impact width in the statistical equilibrium in a plasma to determine line ratio that can be an important diagnostic for studying plasma .",
    "we have tested the influence of using different sources of atomic and collisional data .",
    "we have used a powerful method to calculate the line ratio i(1407.3 )/i(1401.1  ) by introducing homogenous atomic and collisional data that are mostly calculated by us .",
    "tests for other lines and for other ions will be done as well as the study of the influence of different parameters ( atomic collisional data and parameters of the plasma ) .",
