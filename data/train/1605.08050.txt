    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is known to generate multi - wavelength radiation by mass accretion onto a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in its central engine .",
    "an important element of the central engine is the standard accretion disk ( e.g. , shakura & suynaev 1973 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; machida 2000 ) , which is expected to form at the eddington ratio of @xmath111 ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1995 ) , and converts appreciable fraction of the gravitational energy release of the accreting matter into optically - thick radiation .",
    "a part of the radiation has been observed as  big blue bump \" seen in optical spectra from agns that have disk radiation stronger than jet emission , like seyfert galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , elvis et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the central engine requires another element that boosts up these low - energy photons into the observed x - ray signals .",
    "this is usually attributed to some sort of hot maxwellian electrons , or `` corona '' , which compton - upscatter the seed photons into broadband x - ray photons .",
    "however , the configuration of such corona is still under big debates , in contrast to the well - understood standard accretion disk .",
    "some x - ray studies led to an argument that a compact corona is located on a rotation axis of the accretion disk like a `` lamppost '' , producing an extremely relativistically - broadened reflection component by illuminating the inner accretion disk ( e.g. , miniutti & fabian 2004 ; dauser et al .",
    "others argue that an extended corona is present at the inner edge of an accretion disk , sometimes affected by partially - covering absorptions of ionized matters ( e.g. , miller et al . 2008 ; miyakawa et al .",
    "2012 ) . to settle the scenario of the comptonizing corona , we need to focus on primary x - ray spectra and their flux variability .",
    "according to x - ray studies of agns , several kinds of primary x - ray signals with distinct spectral and timing properties were reported .",
    "a flat primary spectrum , which is reproduced by a single power - law ( pl ) continuum with the photon index of @xmath12 , dominates in x - rays from relatively low eddington - ratio agns ( e.g. , terashima et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a steep primary continuum , which can be explained by a pl model with @xmath13 , is dominant in x - rays from highly - accreting agns like narrow - line type 1 seyferts ( e.g. , laor et al .",
    "1994 ; boller et al .",
    "recently , noda et al . ( 2011a , 2013a , and 2014 ) revealed that both these flat and steep primary continua are simultaneously present in the x - ray emission from multiple seyfert galaxies .",
    "the presence of these different primary x - rays may represent presence of several distinct types of coronae with different electron temperatures and optical depths .",
    "furthermore , in order to explain a soft x - ray excess structure at a low energy band below @xmath14 kev , a soft thermal comtonization continuum has been suggested , invoking yet another corona ( e.g. , mehdipour et al .",
    "2011 ; noda et al .",
    "2011b , 2013b ; jin et al .",
    "the reality of this third corona , however , needs further examination , because the soft excess may alternatively be modeled in terms of relativistically - smeared ionized reflection ( e.g. , fabian et al . 2004 ) or absorption by disk winds ( e.g. , cierlinski & done 2004 ) .",

    "recently , studies of reverberation between different x - ray bands revealed that soft x - rays and fe - k@xmath7 emission lines have positive time lags , by hundreds seconds , against hard x - rays , with an implication that some reprocessing materials are present near the hard x - ray emitters ( e.g. , uttley et al .",
    "2014 ) . likewise ,",
    "x - ray and optical / ultraviolet ( uv ) correlations are useful to investigate coronal geometries around an accretion disk .",
    "because seed photons for the inverse comptonization process are presumably provided via the optical / uv disk black body , variations in these low - energy bands can precede that of x - rays with a lag of @xmath29days ( e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "when fluctuations of the mass accretion rate propagate inward from the accretion disk to the corona , the optical emission is also expected to precede x - rays , but on a viscous or thermalizing time scale which may be much longer than days ( e.g. , uttley & casella 2014 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the disk should be illuminated by the x - rays , so that x - ray variations can cause optical flux changes , producing delays of @xmath29days in the opposite sense ( e.g. , krolik et al . 1991 ) . in order to distinguish these cases , and to better understand the geometry of the coronae and accretion disk",
    ", we need to measure the sign and length of the optical vs. x - ray time lag , and quantify the strength of their correlations .",
    "so far , a large amount of effort has been invested on coordinated x - ray and optical / uv observations of a number of agns .",
    "however , we are far from achieving a unified view . for example , seyfert galaxies including ngc 5548 ( uttley et al . 2003 ; suganuma et al . 2006 ; mchardy et al . 2014 ) , ngc 3783 ( arevalo et al . 2009 ) , and mrk 79 ( breedt et al . 2000 ) exhibited relatively strong correlations with optical lags by several days , while those including ark 564 ( gaskell 2006 ) and ngc 3516 ( maoz et al .",
    "2002 ) showed much poorer correlations .",
    "one possible cause of this variety , we speculate , is that the different x - ray primary continua have different correlations to the optical / uv signals , and the previous coordinated observations mixed up the effects from these multiple x - ray components . to overcome this difficulty , simultaneous observations of agns should be conducted , under a condition wherein the different x - ray components can be clearly identified and separated .    to derive the geometrical information from the multi - wavelength correlations",
    ", we performed an x - ray and optical simultaneous monitoring during 20132014 , by utilizing _",
    "( mitsuda et al . 2007 ) and 5 japanese ground - based telescopes .",
    "the target of this campaign is the bright type 1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc 3516 .",
    "it has a redshift of @xmath30 which corresponds to a distance of @xmath31 mpc @xmath32 cm .",
    "its smbh is estimated to have a mass of @xmath33 ( denney et al .",
    "2010 ) , which yields the schwarzschild radius of @xmath34 cm .",
    "the column density of the galactic interstellar absorption toward ngc 3516 is @xmath35 @xmath5 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , and the optical galactic extinction is @xmath36 mag ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database based on schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) .",
    "although ngc 3516 was previously reported , by maoz et al . ( 2002 ) , to exhibit a poor x - ray and optical correlation , the result will change if we properly decompose its x - ray continuum using the technique of noda et al .",
    "( 2011b , 2013b ) , because ngc 3516 is one of the prototypical objects to which this method has been successfully applied ( noda et al . 2013 ) .",
    "unless otherwise stated , errors shown in tables and figures in the present paper refer 1@xmath37 errors .",
    "the x - ray monitoring observations of ngc 3516 were performed in the _ suzaku _ ao-8 cycle during 20132014 .",
    "specifically , ngc 3516 was observed with _",
    "suzaku _ five times from 2013 april 10 to may 29 , with intervals of @xmath382 weeks .",

    "the data of the xis and hxd - pin were processed via the software version 2.4 . in the xis analysis",
    ", we added the data of xis0 and xis3 , and utilized it as fi data , while we did not use xis1 due to its higher background .",

    "the hxd data were prepared by the same way as that of the xis . in the hxd analysis ,",

    "the optical photometric monitoring observations of ngc 3516 were performed by using the charge - coupled device ( ccd ) cameras installed at the pirka , mitsume , kiso shcmidt , nayuta , and kanata telescopes , of which major parameters are summarized in table [ tab : optobs ] .",
    "simultaneous monitoring observations were performed at the same 7 epochs as the x - ray observations by _ suzaku_. in addition , from 2013 january to 2014 april , these telescopes densely monitored the source even without the simultaneous x - ray coverage , with a typical intervals of @xmath44  day . in the present paper ,",
    "we present the @xmath1- and the @xmath20-bands photometric data , because the optical continuum emission of agns is generally bluer than that of the host galaxy , thus ensuring better sensitivity to the agn signals .",
    "the images were reduced using iraf following the standard procedures of image reduction for ccd detectors .",
    "figure [ fig : xis_lc ] shows light curves in the 23 kev and 310 kev bands in all the 7 epochs . while we can see gradual flux changes , the source did not show short - term variations , on time scales of @xmath29hours , that were observed by _ xmm - newton _ in 2006 ( mehdipour et al .",
    "the 23 kev light curves are clearly synchronized with that in the 310 kev band .",
    "the highest flux was obtained in epoch 4 , while the lowest in epoch 7 , with a peak to peak variation amplitude reaching a factor of @xmath40 . to quantify the flux variability , we made , in figure [ fig : xccp ] , a count - count plot between count rates in the 23 kev and 33.5 kev bands , where these objects generally exhibit rather high variability ( noda et al .",
    "2013a ) . the count - count plot of ngc 3516 derived in 2009 october ( noda et al .",
    "2013c ) is also shown for reference , after correcting the data for a pointing position difference and long - term changes in the detector response .",
    "surprisingly , all the data points in 20132014 line up with those in 2009 , thus defining an almost linear correlation between the two bands .",
    "this means that the variable component in those energy bands observed in 20132014 has nearly the same spectral shape to that detected in 2009 .    in energy bands higher than 3.5 kev , a reflection component with a prominent fe - k@xmath7 emission line at @xmath45 kev",
    "is expected to become more dominant than in energies below 3.5 kev .",
    "therefore , this variable component should be separated from the reflection via spectral fitting .",
    "although the reflection component is considered almost stationary within a week ( noda et al .",
    "2013b ) , it can vary on timescales of months , because a broad line region and/or a dusty torus , where the reflection emission possibly originates , are known to locate at several tens ",

    "although @xmath102 slightly varied , the low - energy shapes of the time - averaged spectra were not so strongly affected ( see figure [ fig : xspectra ] ) .",

    "the largest flux change of the hard pl emission in 210 kev is @xmath115 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in difference , and a factor of @xmath116 between epoch 4 and 7 .    for further information about the agn activity in ngc 3516",
    ", we also performed the spectral analysis including the energy band below 2 kev .",
    "for this purpose we selected epoch 7 , where the agn was faintest .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ fig : lowenespec ] , the spectrum on this occasion exhibits a prominent soft x - ray excess at @xmath117 kev , which is much less prominent in the other epochs . in order to examine",
    "if the soft excess structure originates from the agn activity , we fitted the 0.510 kev spectrum at epoch 7 by two contrasting models ; ( a ) ` wabs * ( cutoffpl + pexmon ) + apec ` and ( b ) ` wabs * ( cutoffpl + pexmon + kdblur * reflionx ) ` . in model ( a ) , the soft excess is explained by ` apec ` ( smith et al . 2001 ) which represents thin - thermal plasma emission from the host galaxy , while in model ( b ) by a ` kdblur * reflionx ` model ( laor 1991 ; ross & fabian 2005 ) which describes relativistically - smeared reflection continuum . as a result ,",
    "the fit with model ( a ) became successful with @xmath118 ( figure [ fig : lowenespec]a ) , in which the soft excess , apparently involving emission lines , is reproduced by the plasma emission model . on the other hand , the fits with model ( b ) was unsuccessful with @xmath119 , mainly due to lack of the emission lines at @xmath120 kev and a convex data shape in the 25 kev band ( figure [ fig : lowenespec]b ) .",
    "therefore , the spectrum below 2 kev is dominated by the host galaxy emission , at least in epoch 7 .",
    "this justifies us to limit the spectral studies to the energies above @xmath121 kev .",
    "of course , the agn emission , when bright , probably dominates down to @xmath122 kev , but is strongly affected by ionized - absorption features at @xmath123 kev , as shown in figure [ fig : lowenespec](a ) .      according to changes of the atmospheric seeing during an observation , the flux of an agn within an aperture changes differently from that of the host galaxy , leading to a significant uncertainty in measuring the flux variation of a faint agn hosted by a bright galaxy . to minimize such uncertainty in the photometry of the ngc 3516 nucleus , we therefore performed difference image photometry ( dip ; crotts 1992 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 ) .",
    "as presented in figure [ fig : ngc3516_b_mint_6x6arcmin_log.ps ] for example , a reference image was created by stacking many images obtained at the same night with good seeing condition .",
    "then , we matched the position , the photometric intensity , and the point - spread function ( psf ) of the reference image to those of each individual image and subtracted the former from the latter .",
    "two nearby field stars , located at ( ra , dec ) @xmath124 ( 11:06:28.51 , + 72:35:46.2 ) and ( 11:07:00.41 , + 72:33:33.3 ) , were used as the reference to match the photometric intensity and the psf . the iraf _ psfmatch _ task was used for matching the psfs .",
    "after that , for each individual image , the residual flux at the center of the galaxy was measured relative to the two nearby reference stars , with a circular aperture of @xmath125full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf in diameter .",
    "finally , the residual flux data at the same observing night were averaged to obtain the flux difference of the ngc 3516 nucleus at that epoch with respect to the reference image .",
    "the photometric error was estimated from the ensemble scatter of the dip fluxes and the number of the images obtained at the same night .",
    "these procedures were applied to the data set of each telescope , individually .    because the observing epochs of the reference images used in the dip analysis depend on the telescopes , there can be systematic offsets between them .",
    "systematic differences in the scaling factor among them are also possible because of the differences in the filter color term . to match the offset and the scaling factor among the four telescopes , we therefore performed a linear regression analysis to their @xmath1-band flux data sets of the same observing nights .",
    "an example , between two telescopes , is presented in figure [ fig : kwfc_mint_ff.ps ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath110 of the linear regression was much larger than unity when only the photometric errors were incorporated . because this suggests the presence of some systematic errors , we added an error @xmath126 to the photometric errors in quadrature , and regarded it as the systematic error of the photometry . by requiring the reduced @xmath110 to become unity , @xmath127 mjy was obtained .",

    "the larger relative scatters of the @xmath20-band data points are caused by the small telescope size and the large pixel scale of the camera ( mitsume ) by which the data were obtained .",

    "the x - ray data of epoch 15 and the optical data of mjd @xmath154@xmath155 were selected for the ccf analysis , because the most remarkable flux variations were present in those epochs , and also because the @xmath1-band light curve data were sampled densely ( figure [ fig : xolc ] and [ fig : xolc1 - 5 ] ) .",

    "the uncertainty of @xmath161 is estimated using the model - independent monte carlo method of flux randomization and random subset sampling ( fr / rss ) introduced by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2004 ) .",
    "the fr method modifies the observed fluxes in each realization randomly within the errors assigned to the individual data points , and the rss method randomly extracts the same number of data points from the observed light curve allowing for multiple extraction .",

    "rxte _ and the israeli _ wise _ telescope in 19972002 , no significant correlations were derived between x - ray and @xmath1-band flux variations , giving a cross correlation coefficient of @xmath202 ( maoz et al .",
    "in contrast , we succeeded in detecting a significant correlation between them with a high cross correlation coefficient of @xmath203 .",
    "what is responsible for the clear difference ?",
    "maoz et al . (",
    "2002 ) argued that the lack of correlation might be due to absorption changes that are independent of the primary x - ray variations .",
    "however , the 210 kev flux varied during their monitoring by a factor of @xmath204 in peak to peak . such a large change would be hardly explained by the so - far recored variations in the column density of optically - thick neutral absorbers ( turner et al .",
    "we hence suggest alternatively that the dominant x - ray variable component changed between the two monitoring campaigns .",
    "noda et al .",
    "( 2013 ) discovered that the x - ray emission of ngc 3516 comprises at least two different primary continua with distinct spectral shape and flux variability ; a flat ( @xmath2051.7 ) and steep ( @xmath206 ) spectral continua , which we hereafter call the hard and gradually - varying primary component ( hgpc ) , and the soft and rapidly - varying primary component ( srpc ) , respectively .",
    "noda et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed that luminosities of the hgpc and srpc were comparable in a bright state in 2005 , when the absorption - corrected 210 kev total flux was @xmath207 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the 2009 suzaku observation caught ngc 3516 in a faint state with @xmath208 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 , wherein the variation was carried solely by a @xmath209 pl which can be identified with the hgpc .",
    "thus , there is a certain threshold in between these two flux values , say , at @xmath210 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 ; above @xmath211 the hgpc and srpc coexist , whereas only the hgpc remains below @xmath211 .",
    "these two primary continua have also been identified in another seyfert ngc 3227 ( noda et al .",
    "2014 ) : their luminosity - dependent behavior was found to be very similar to that observed from ngc 3516 .",
    "namely , the hgpc was always present , whereas the srpc appeared when the source was brighter than a certain threshold , to become co - existent with the other .    in the present _ suzaku",
    "_ observations , the absorption - corrected 210 kev flux of ngc 3516 was in the range @xmath212 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 , i.e. , always below the suggested @xmath211 . furthermore , the 245 kev spectrum of the main variable pl was flat with @xmath111 , and the ccp distributions are smoothly connected to those in 2009 ( figure [ fig : xccp ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that ngc 3516 was in the faint phase , with the hgpc dominating just as in the 2009 observation . on the other hand , during the 19972002 monitoring by maoz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the averaged 210 kev flux was @xmath213 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 which is higher than @xmath211 , indicating that ngc 3516 was mostly in the bright phase .",
    "if the srpc has a significantly poorer correlation with the optical than the hgpc does , the correlation between the total x - ray flux and the optical should become worse when ngc 3516 is in the bright phase .",
    "thus , the difference between maoz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and ours may be explained by presuming that the hgpc is well correlated with the optical while the srpc is not .    to generalize the above conclusion , we collected cross correlation coefficients ( cccs ) from peak values of the ccf in previous simultaneous observations of various seyferts . as a result",
    ", sources with high @xmath214 ratios were found to have relatively low cccs ; mcg6 - 30 - 15 with @xmath215 has @xmath216 ( lira et al .",
    "2015 ) , ngc 4051 with @xmath217 has @xmath218 ( breedt et al .",
    "2009 ) , and mr 2251 - 178 with @xmath215 has @xmath219 ( arevalo et al .",
    "in contrast , sources with low @xmath214 ratios possibly have high cccs ; ngc 6814 with @xmath220 has @xmath221 ( troyer et al .",
    "2015 ) ; and ngc 3516 in the present study has @xmath222 wherein @xmath223 is indicated by the value of 0.00612 ( vasudevan & fabian 2009 ) , obtained in 2001 when ngc 3516 showed @xmath224 close to the second highest among ours .",
    "therefore , we speculate that x - ray  optical correlation in seyfert galaxies becomes commonly worse when the eddington ratio gets higher , because the srpc start dominating .",
    "according to figure 12(b ) and related descriptions in noda et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the srpc may originate from patchy coronae heated by magnetic process on the surface of a disk ( e.g. , reynolds & nowak 2003 ) . if covering fraction of the patchy coronae against the disk is small , the srpc generated in the coronae can be related to just small areas of the disk , making x - ray and optical variations independent .",
    "another possible origin of the srpc is a faulty jet at the accretion axis of the smbh ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "if the jet emission region is located far away from the accretion disk as suggested by noda et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , connection between the srpc and the disk optical emission may become weaker , making their correlation poorer . in any case",
    ", the emergence and disappearance of these srpc - generating regions are likely to be more localized effects than those responsible for the hard vs. soft state transitions seen in black - hole binaries , because the agn state changes considered here take place on time scales of weeks to years , which are much shorter than would be expected ( e.g. , several ten thousand years ) if the typical state - transition time scales , @xmath29days , are scaled to the mass ratios .",
    "the measured optical lag of @xmath9 days strongly supports the x - ray reprocessing model ( e.g. , krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; cackett et al .",
    "2007 ) ; optical brightening occurred , at least in the present case , through irradiation by the increased hard x - ray intensity .",
    "this process is energetically feasible , because the 210 kev x - ray flux increase by @xmath225 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 is comparable to the @xmath1-band flux increase by @xmath226 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the optical lag time in ngc 3516 obtained here is similar to those of a few days observed from other seyfert galaxies , including ngc 5548 ( e.g. , suganuma et al .",
    "2006 ; mchardy et al . 2014 ; edelson et al .",

    "2009 ) , ngc 4051 ( breedt et al . 2010 ) , and ngc 6418 ( troyer et al . 2015 ) .",
    "therefore , the suggested mechanism , i.e. , the x - ray reprocessing , can be operating commonly among these seyfert galaxies .",
    "let us , then , investigate whether or not the derived optical lag can be explained by the most commonly adopted x - ray reprocessing model ( e.g. , cackett et al .",
    "2007 ) , which assumes that an optically - thick geometrically - thin standard accretion disk continues down to the innermost last - stable circular orbit ( isco ) , located at @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath229 the black - hole mass , and is illuminated by a lamppost - type x - ray source proximate to the black hole . at radii @xmath230",

    "the x - ray flux variation that arose close to the black hole will propagate to a radius @xmath234 , and will increase the emissivity there .",
    "let us define a wavelength @xmath235 in such a way that the continuum emission at this radius is peaked at @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "although the wien s displacement law for a blackbody radiation in @xmath238 gives @xmath239 , we here set @xmath240 , according to the detailed calculations of the disk response to continuum emission by cackett et al .",

    "first of all , it indicates an unrealistic  super - eddington \" condition .",
    "even putting aside this issue , it means a factor of @xmath251 discrepancy against the likely value of @xmath252 (   4.2 ) , which characterizes the ngc 3516 nucleus during the present observations .",
    "the difficulty can be more directly stated : by summing up the blackbody contributions from various disk annuli , the continuum spectrum from the accretion disk under consideration can be calculated as @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the disk inclination ( collier et al . 1999 ; cackett et al .",
    "thus , the measured delay predicts very bright optical emission , arising from the inner part of the accretion disk . in other words ,",
    "the smbh would have to be accreting with a very high rate , in order for its accretion disk to emit the @xmath1-band light from such a large distance as @xmath159 light days .",
    "equation ( 4 ) means a two - orders - of - magnitude contradiction to the present optical data , that the peak - to - peak flux variation in the @xmath1 band was @xmath130 mjy , and the minimum @xmath1-band flux during the observation would be less than that .",
    "inversely , if we started from the assumption of @xmath255 ",
    "@xmath256 , the @xmath1-band lag predicted by eq.(3 ) would become @xmath257 times smaller than was measured .",

    "( 2014 ) , typical seyfert galaxies including ngc 5548 , ngc 4051 , and mrk 335 yielded @xmath157 that are a few times larger than those expected from their estimated @xmath249 . according to mogan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the accretion disk sizes of gravitationally lensed quasars are larger , by a factor of @xmath204 , than those expected from @xmath249 , just like in the seyfert galaxies .",
    "these subtle but systematic contradictions between the disk size and @xmath249 have also been well known in the x - ray reprocessing scenario ( e.g. , collier et al .",
    "1999 , cackett et al .",
    "recently , troyer et al . (",
    "2015 ) reported that ngc 6814 exhibited @xmath157 which is @xmath276 times larger than that predicted from the estimated @xmath249 . in the present case of ngc  3516 , the measured vs. predicted difference in the optical delay amounts to a factor of @xmath277 , which is considerably larger than those of ngc 5548 , ngc 4051 , and mrk 335 .",
    "these systematic discrepancies imply that the lamppost - type x - ray irradiation geometry shown in figure [ fig : model](a ) has a common problem , which is considered to become more prominent towards lower luminosities , considering that ngc 3516 and ngc 6814 have both relatively low values of @xmath249 .",
    "thus , we need to revise the geometrical assumptions , in order to make @xmath157 and @xmath249 consistent in low eddington - ratio seyfert galaxies .      what kind of geometry of the corona and the accretion disk can reconcile @xmath249 and @xmath157 from the present study ?",
    "the contradiction in the lamppost - type x - ray reprocessing model , revealed in  4.3.1 , arises mainly because the observed luminosity is too low for the size of the accretion disk determined by the observed time lag .",
    "conversely , the measured @xmath278 days is too large to be explained by the standard scenario , given the very low luminosity . in this respect",
    ", it has been very essential that the present observations caught the object at a very faint state not only in x - rays but also in the optical band ( see the final paragraph in  3.2 ) .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath279 inconsistency can not be solved even if considering an anisotropically - irradiating lamppost corona ( dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) that would make the x - ray flux we observe much lower than that illuminating accretion disk . hence , we need to consider other geometries of the corona and the accretion disk that can reconcile @xmath249 and @xmath157 from the present study .",
    "one possible variant of the lamppost - type scenario is to place the x - ray source at a large height from the smbh , to achieve @xmath280 light days . in this geometry ,",
    "x - ray flux variations can still precede that in the optical .",
    "furthermore , the inner part of the accretion disk can be made rather cool , because @xmath232 can be reduced and @xmath281 gets much smaller than that with the assumption of @xmath265 .",
    "these would make the black body flux low enough to be consistent with the observed optical faintness .",
    "such a lamppost - type corona with @xmath282 was suggested to form at the base of a jet moving away from a smbh with relativistic speeds ( e.g. , lohfink et al .",
    "2013 ; wilkins & gallo 2015 ) .",
    "however , the value of @xmath280 light days , or @xmath283 , which is required to explain the present results , is orders of magnitude larger than invoked in the previous studies",
    ". it would be highly unrealistic to assume that such an emission region forms at a height of @xmath283 in this radio - quiet object , and that the region radiates essentially the _ entire primary x - ray emission _ (  3.1 ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emission mechanism from such a region is problematic .",
    "as observed from bl - lac objects , synchrotron radiation would give an x - ray spectral slope of @xmath284 ( e.g. , tanihata et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is much steeper than we observed ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "comptonization of soft photons from the accretion disk would produce _ x - ray delays _ , contrary to the observed optical delay . in short ,",
    "this variant scenario fails to explain the present results .",
    "as we noted repeatedly , the x - ray reprocessing model which has so far been considered ( figure [ fig : model]a ) assumes the optically - thick accretion disk to extend down to near the isco .",
    "however , it has long been known theoretically ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1995 ) that a decreased luminosity , e.g. , to @xmath285 , causes inner regions of such a disk to make a transition into an optically - thin and geometrically - thick hot flow .",
    "this will lead to a configuration shown in figure [ fig : model](b ) ; the disk is truncated at a radius much larger than the isco , and the accretion flow inside that radius may form a radiatively inefficient accretion flow , or riaf ( e.g. , yuan & narayan 2014 ) . such bimodal behavior of accretion disks has been firmly verified through extensive observations of black - hole binaries ( e.g. , done et al .",
    "the truncated disk picture has also been investigated by many authors , both observationally and theoretically , to explain low - luminosity agns ( e.g. ho 2008 ; taam et al .",
    "2012 ; nemmen et al . 2014 ; and references therein ) .",
    "it is hence much more natural to try to explain the present results based on the geometry of figure [ fig : model](b ) .",
    "referring to figure [ fig : model](b ) , let us then consider an accretion disk that is truncated at a radius @xmath286 light days ( or @xmath251 times there schwarzschild radii ) from the smbh .",
    "let us also assume that the accreting matter inside this radius forms a riaf region , where the illuminating hard x - ray photons are produced via comptonization ( noda et al . 2013a , 2014 ; makishima et al .",
    "2008 ; yamada et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in such a hot riaf region , the electron density and temperature are theoretically predicted to increase inwards towards the smbh ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas the seed photon flux for inverse comptonization obviously increases towards positions closer to the disk .",
    "hence , the x - ray emissivity are considered to become maximum at a location in between the smbh and the inner disk edge .",
    "then , the optical delay of @xmath287 days can be explained simply as the light travel time from the x - ray brightest regions to the inner disk edge .",
    "of course , this scenario requires a relatively low inclination , in order not to produce large differences in the light travel time to us , from the near side and far side of the disk ; ngc 3516 may satisfy the condition , because of a relatively low inclination value of @xmath288 ( wu & han et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the truncated - disk picture can naturally explain , at the same time , the optical faintness , because the large amount of continuum radiation originating in the inner part of the accretion disk is no longer present .",
    "the @xmath1-band to x - ray flux ratio of ngc 3516 in these epochs is @xmath289 .",
    "it is much lower than that of the composite spectrum for radio - quiet quasars ( @xmath290 ; shang et al .",
    "2011 ) , but is consistent with those of the composite and model spectra for low - luminosity agns ( ho 2008 ; nemmen et al . 2014 ) . to be quantitative ,",
    "let us assume , in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath291 erg s@xmath4 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 light days , and @xmath294 .",
    "then , the illuminating x - ray flux at a distance of 2.0 light days from the x - ray - bright region is calculated as @xmath295 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 during the peak of the flux variation .",
    "it predicts the disk temperature at the inner radius to be @xmath296k wherein @xmath1-band photons can be produced on the wien side , even when the viscous heating is ignored in eq .",
    "( 8) . incidentally , the disk temperature would increase by a factor of @xmath297 if the disk extended down to the isco .    as another merit of the truncated - disk scenario ,",
    "the gradual x - ray variations without any intraday changes can be explained as well by the large volume of the riaf region .",
    "in addition , the observed hard x - ray spectrum with @xmath298 can be naturally explained as arising from the hot riaf region via thermal comptonization , as theoretically predicted ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , and observed from black - hole binaries ( e.g. , makishima et al .",
    "moreover , as shown in figure [ fig : lowenespec ] , the soft x - ray band at epoch 7 was dominated by the galactic thin - thermal plasma emission , and no relativistically - smeared spectral components were required , also supporting that the standard accretion disk did not continue down to the isco .",
    "this scenario may be able to solve the @xmath157 vs. @xmath249 conflict in the other low-@xmath249 seyferts as well , including ngc 6814 in particular ( troyer et al .",
    "we hence prefer the picture of the truncated disk and riaf shown in figure [ fig : model](b ) .    how does our model compare with other attempts on the same subject ?",
    "recently , gardner & done ( 2016 ) proposed a model , that a geometrically - thick region , called the soft - excess region , is present at the inner edge of an accretion disk , and completely hides the hard x - ray corona .",
    "far - ultraviolet photons , arising from the soft - excess region by the x - ray illumination , are reprocessed by optically - thick clouds distributing above the accretion disk , and produce optical variations .",
    "this model is different from ours in that x - rays from the corona can not directly reach the accretion disk , and the optical variation is mainly due to the clouds rather than the disk .",
    "presumably , our ngc 3516 results can not be explained by the model of gardner & done ( 2016 ) , because the 0.52 kev spectrum at epoch 7 is explained adequately by the galactic emission , without any strong soft excess resulting from the agn activity .",
    "therefore , we prefer our model ( figure [ fig : model]b ) to theirs .    for some quasars",
    ", it is claimed that the accretion disks , as measured by the uv - optical microlensing observations , are generally several times larger than those predicted by the standard accretion disk model ( e.g. , morgan et al .",
    "these measurements are thought to be observing the unexpectedly large disk size like those revealed by the x - ray - to - optical continuum reverberation mapping for nearby seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , edelson et al .",
    "2015 , mchardy et al .",
    "dexter & agol ( 2011 ) suggested that the large disk size of quasars from microlensing is due to stochastic and strong local temperature fluctuations on the effective temperature profile of the standard accretion disk .",
    "their inhomogeneous disk model is designed to enhance the flux contribution from outer disk radii , and thus make the disk half - light radius larger than the predictions of the standard accretion disk .",
    "however , their model , which does not consider the x - ray emission and attributes all uv  optical variability to the assumed temperature fluctuations , can not explain the strong x - ray vs. optical correlations observed in ngc 3516 and other seyfert galaxies .",
    "furthermore , kokubo ( 2015 ) showed that the disk model in dexter & agol ( 2011 ) can not explain , either , the tight inter - band correlations often observed in the optical light curves of quasars .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss about the model any further .    for further refinement of the truncated - disk model , and its demarcation from the large-@xmath264 model , correlations and time lags among different optical bands , including @xmath299 ,",
    "@xmath17 , and @xmath242 bands become important ( e.g. , kokubo et al .",
    "2014 ; edelson et al . 2015 ; fausnaugh et al .",
    "2015 ; kokubo 2015 ) . these will be discussed in elsewhere .",
    "the present coordinated x - ray and optical observations of ngc 3516 found the object in a very faint state in both wavelengths .",
    "a tightly correlated intensity change lasting for @xmath300 days was detected , wherein the optical @xmath1-band variation showed a clear delay by @xmath159 days behind that of the x - ray continuum which is described by a power - law model with @xmath298 .",
    "this optical lag indicates the effect of x - ray reprocessing , but the delay can not be reconciled with the @xmath1-band faintness , as long as we consider the standard reprocessing scenario which invokes a standard accretion disk irradiated by a lamppost - type x - ray source . instead , the observed results can be consistently explained assuming that the disk is truncated at @xmath283 , and turns into a riaf where the illuminating hard x - rays are produced via thermal comptonization .",

    "<S> from 2013 april to 2014 april , we performed an x - ray and optical simultaneous monitoring of the type 1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc  3516 . </S>",
    "<S> it employed _ suzaku _ , and 5 japanese ground - based telescopes , the pirka , kiso schmidt , nayuta , mitsume , and the kanata telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the _ suzaku _ </S>",
    "<S> observations were conducted seven times with various intervals ranging from days , weeks , to months , with an exposure of @xmath0  ksec each . </S>",
    "<S> the optical @xmath1-band observations not only covered those of _ suzaku _ almost simultaneously , but also followed the source as frequently as possible . as a result , ngc  3516 was found in its faint phase with the 210 kev flux of @xmath2@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the 245 kev x - ray spectra were composed of a dominant variable hard power - law continuum with a photon index of @xmath6 , and a non - relativistic reflection component with a prominent fe - k@xmath7 emission line . </S>",
    "<S> producing the @xmath1-band light curve by differential image photometry , we found that the @xmath1-band flux changed by @xmath8  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath5 , which is comparable to the x - ray variation , and detected a significant flux correlation between the hard power - law component in x - rays and the @xmath1-band radiation , for the first time in ngc  3516 . by examining their correlation </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the x - ray flux preceded that of @xmath1 band by @xmath9  days ( @xmath10 error ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this result supports the x - ray reprocessing model , the derived lag is too large to be explained by the standard view which assumes a `` lamppost''-type x - ray illuminator located near a standard accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> our results are better explained by assuming a hot accretion flow and a truncated disk . </S>"
