    "half the interstellar medium in late type spiral galaxies is in molecular gas clouds , and about 90% by number of the atoms within these clouds are tied up in the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "stars form within molecular clouds , and the pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 are important coolants enabling cloud collapse .",
    "the cooling radiation from these lines is also important to the formation of the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) themselves . despite its abundance and importance ,",
    "very little is known about cool h@xmath0 on galactic scales .",
    "this is because h@xmath0 has no dipole moment , so that dipole radiation from its low - lying rotational energy levels is forbidden .",
    "the low lying levels instead radiatively decay by emitting relatively weak quadrupole ( @xmath5j = 2 ) radiation .",
    "therefore the pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 are challenging to observe .",
    "three of the low lying lines : the s(1 ) ( 17.0@xmath6 m ) , s(2 ) ( 12.3@xmath6 m ) , and the s(4 ) ( 8.0@xmath6 m ) lines are transmitted through the earth s atmosphere , and have been detected from regions as diverse as supernovae remnants @xcite , photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) associated with ob star formation sites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and disks enveloping young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , detection of the lowest lying s(0 ) ( 28.2@xmath6 m ) line , and detection of these lines from cool molecular clouds in external galaxies awaited the advent of the short wavelength spectrometers ( sws ) on the infrared space observatory ( iso , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a few years later , the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) of the spitzer space telescope became available and the detection of these lines from a wide variety of external galaxies became routine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath0 exists in two varieties : para ( nuclear spins anti - aligned ) and ortho ( spins aligned ) . the relative ortho - to - para ( @xmath7 )",
    "abundances reflect the local gas temperature since proton exchange reactions with h@xmath8 , h and h@xmath9 are effective in thermalizing the @xmath7 ratio ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at high temperatures",
    "( t@xmath10200 k ) the o / p ratio is set by the ratio of statistical weights at 3:1 . since there is no radiative coupling between the ortho and para species , when analyzing radiative transitions they can be treated as independent molecules . the lowest lying transitions for the para species are : j=2 - 0 ( s(0 ) , 28.2@xmath6 m ) , and 4 - 2 ( s(2 ) , 12.3@xmath6 m ) , and for the ortho species : j=3 - 1 ( s(1 ) , 17.0@xmath6 m ) , and j=5 - 3 ( s(3 ) , 9.7@xmath6 m ) . with their very small einstein a coefficients the h@xmath0 level populations",
    "are easily thermalized at molecular cloud densities , and the emitted lines are nearly always optically thin .",
    "therefore , the line intensities trace the column density of the emitting level , and since the line emitting levels are thermalized and lie hundreds of degrees above the ground state ( larger than typical molecular gas temperatures ) , the line ratios within a species should reflect the gas temperature , t@xmath11 .",
    "for example , the s(2)/s(0 ) line ratio gets larger by a factor of 150 as t@xmath11 goes from 70 to 100 k. the para j=2 level lies just 510 k above the ground so it can be emitted by cool ( t@xmath12 k ) molecular gas and is an important coolant for molecular clouds in , for example , the early stages of collapse into protostars ( t@xmath4100 k , n@xmath13100@xmath14 ) .",
    "are the rotational lines of h@xmath0 detectable from normal star forming galaxies , and if so , is the emitting gas important ?",
    "work with the iso - sws demonstrated that the answer to both questions is an emphatic yes . large scale s(0 ) and s(1 ) line emission is reported both from the face - on sc galaxy ngc 6946 @xcite , and the edge on sb galaxy ngc891 @xcite .",
    "the strong emission indicates surprisingly large masses of warm molecular gas .",
    "spitzer irs studies confirm that strong h@xmath0 rotational line emission and large masses of warm molecular gas are common in a wide variety of galaxies including nuclei of starburst galaxies @xcite and ulirgs @xcite , in disk of galaxies @xcite , extragalactic regions such as stephan s quintet @xcite , as well as tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "is a nearby ( d = 9.5 mpc @xcite ) sb galaxy that is presented to us nearly edge - on and is thought to be a close milky way analogue . since an edge - on galaxy presents the largest column densities to our telescopes , and the h@xmath0 rotational lines are optically thin , ngc891 provides the best opportunity to study warm h@xmath0 in the outer reaches of galaxies . with the iso - sws",
    ", @xcite detected the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines at eight positions along the plane of ngc891 .",
    "the lines were surprisingly strong even in the outer regions of the stellar disk .",
    "assuming @xmath7 = 3 they find warm ( t@xmath15130 to 230 k ) molecular cloud component pervades the galactic disk with a total mass comparable to both the atomic hi and the cold molecular gas as traced through its co emission : m@xmath16 @xmath17m@xmath18 @xmath4 m@xmath19 .",
    "it would be a surprise if half the molecular ism in the galaxy is warm , and it is a challenge to provide a heating mechanism for this gas .",
    "furthermore , based on a drop in the s(1)/s(0 ) line intensity ratio at radii greater than 8 kpc , @xcite argue for an additional cool ( t@xmath20 90 k ) component which becomes dominant at large radii . with @xmath7 @xmath42 to 3 , the cooler component is massive : m@xmath21 @xmath4 5 - 15 @xmath22 m@xmath19 in the outer disk .",
    "the cool molecular gas mass is so large that it can be a substantial fraction of the `` dark matter '' required to drive the rotation curve out to the edge of the opitical disk of ngc891 .",
    "this is particularly intriguing due to theoretical work that suggests a large fraction of the `` dark '' baryonic matter in galaxies may be in co free h@xmath0 clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the detection of a massive cooler component , if proven correct , is a very significant result .",
    "these results need verification so we have repeated the observations of the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines along the plane of ngc891 using the more sensitive spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope @xcite . in addition , the important s(2 ) line is included in the large instantaneous bandwidth of the spitzer irs .",
    "the addition of the s(2 ) line mapping provides a key element in tracing the gas excitation .",
    "the galaxy was observed on 2004 august 7 as part of the irsguaranteed time ( gt ) program with the two high resolution ( r@xmath4600 ) modules , short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) .",
    "we also obtained supplemental , deep integrations in selected positions through a spitzer cycle 4 open time ( ot ) program with pid 40877 .",
    "for all observations , the sh slits covers the 9.7 - 19.5@xmath6 m range and it is 4.7@xmath23 in size , while lh covers the 18.8 - 37.2@xmath6 m range and its size is 11.1@xmath24 .",
    "the width of each slit was designed so that it is equal to the first airy ring of an unresolved point source at their short wavelength ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we obtained spectra for a total of 27 positions symmetrically sampled around the nucleus of the galaxy at a uniform spacing of 30@xmath25 ( 1.53 kpc ) with a position angle of 23 degree along the galactic plane of ngc891 .",
    "six positions off the galactic plane to the northwest were also included to search for possible extended h@xmath26 emission .",
    "for each pointing , the on - source integration time was 60 and 28 secs for sh and lh respectively .",
    "in addition two off positions to the northeast and northwest away from the galaxy , which were used for background subtraction , were also obtained with twice the integration time .",
    "the irs pointings are indicated in figure 1 with circles of 25@xmath27 in diameter , slightly larger than the length of the lh slit .",
    "the enumeration of the pointings follows the notation of table 1 , which provides the ra and dec of each pointing along with its distance in arcsec along the disk of the galaxy from the central pointing ( id=1 ) . within the ot program",
    ", we obtained on - source integration times of 750 and 900 seconds for 9 positions ( positions 1,6,8,10,12,20,22,24 and 26 in the notation of figure 1 ) and 5 positions ( positions 1,6,8,20,22 ) in sh and lh respectively .",
    "we also re - observed the off possitions for background subtraction .",
    "given the fact that irs has no moving parts and that the long axis of the sh slit is perpendicular to that of the lh slit , we could not modify at will the orientation of the irs slits on the sky .",
    "the slit orientation is determined by the ecliptic coordinates of the science target and the time of observations . by properly selecting the time of the observations",
    ", we were able to ensure that for the sh observations , which contain the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines , the sh slit was placed with the long axis perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the lh observations , which trace the s(0 ) line , were obtained at the same time , with the lh slit placed with the long axis along the plane of the galaxy , since the two slits are perpendicular .",
    "the data were processed by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline version 17.2 .",
    "as it is discussed in detail in the irs manual , for each pointing , two observations are made by placing the target on two nod positions along the slit .",
    "the 128@xmath22128 pixel detectors are read with @xmath28 successive non destructive reads before the final n - th read which also resets the array .",
    "for our observations n=16 for sh and 8 for lh .",
    "the ssc pipeline starts with the 128@xmath29 sh data cubes and converts them to a 128@xmath30 two - dimensional image after linearization correction , subtraction of darks , cosmic - ray removal , stray light and flat field correction .",
    "each image , called basic calibrated data ( bcd ) contains the ten echelle orders of the sh and lh slits respectively .",
    "our analysis started from these bcd files . at each pointing , we subtracted the dedicated off - source background image in order to remove the sky emission from our slit .",
    "then , the two dimensional images were cleaned with the irsclean package to remove the bad pixels as well as to correct the so called  rogue \" pixels .",
    "these are pixels whose values depend not only on the photons they collect , but also on the total number of photons hitting the whole 128@xmath30 array , in a nonlinear manner finally , the cleaned images were used to extract the spectra using the full slit extraction method of the irs data analysis package smart @xcite .",
    "the outputs from smart produced one spectrum at each nod position , and thene the two nod position spectra are combined .",
    "the data from the edge pixels within each echelle order were manually cleaned by truncating a few pixels at the beginning and end of each order and when there was inconsistency , the blue end of the order was preferred .",
    "no scaling was needed between the adjacent grating orders within the same module .",
    "the final errors include both statistical and systematic effects , and we report them in table 1 .",
    "the overall absolute spectrophotometric uncertainty of irs is 5% , so that spectrophotometric uncertainty is small compared with the signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra .",
    "table 1 lists the observed line fluxes and upper limits at all positions , while the locations on the galaxy where these spectra were obtained superposed on an 8@xmath6 m spitzer / irac image of the galaxy , are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "we also plot in figure 2 the spectra around the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , and ( s3 ) h@xmath26 lines from locations where at least one line has been detected .",
    "both the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are clearly detected at 17 of the positions along the galactic plane .",
    "figure 3a plots the line intensity distributions along the plane of galaxy .",
    "the lines have fairly uniform intensities in the inner galaxy , with some enhancement at the nucleus , beginning to fall off at 6.1 kpc ne and 4.6 kpc sw of the nucleus to values below our detection threshold at regions beyond 13.8 kpc ne and sw of the nucleus .",
    "the s(2 ) line was only detected in 11 positions , all within 10 kpc of the nucleus , but this is very likely a sensitivity issue .",
    "the detection limit is similar for all three lines , but the s(2 ) is typically 4 times fainter than the s(0 ) line and 1.7 times fainter than the s(1 ) line .",
    "therefore , its distribution could well be nearly identical to the lower j lines .",
    "the line intensity ratios are also fairly constant across the galaxy , with the exception of enhanced s(1 ) line emission at the nucleus .",
    "we do not detect h@xmath0 line emission off the plane of the galaxy .",
    "however , our integration time is rather modest , so perhaps this is not too surprising : @xcite obtained substantially deeper integrations ( nearly 6.5 hours , or 400 times longer than ours ) at two positions 1 kpc off the disk , where they clearly detected the s(1 ) line .",
    "based on these results @xcite estimate the scale height of the s(1 ) line emission is @xmath48.4 to 9.9 \" ( 390 - 490 pc , based on a distance of 9.5 mpc ) . correcting their results for the expected extinction of the lines by dust , they estimate that the intrinsic width of the warm molecular gas is @xmath44.8 to 5.7@xmath25 ( 220 to 260 pc ) .",
    "it is important to compare our spitzer irs results to those from the iso sws study reported in @xcite .",
    "howevever both the iso and spitzer maps are sparsely sampled , and neither was obtained with a large enough beam to detect all of the extra - planar emission if it is as extensive as the results of @xcite suggest .",
    "we first correct for the missing extra - planar emission , by assuming the apparent ( exponential ) scale height for the h@xmath0 line emission is the average of @xcite s values : 9.1@xmath31 .",
    "we took spitzer lh ( s(0 ) line ) data with the slit width extending @xmath325.55@xmath31 perpendicular to the plane , and sh ( s1 ) and s(2 ) line data with the long axis of the slit expending @xmath325.65@xmath31 perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "for these cases , we calculate that 45% and 46% of the line flux ( integrated perpendicular to the plane ) is detected within our lh and sh beams respectively .",
    "the ( rectangular ) iso beams were 20@xmath33 and 14@xmath34 for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines respectively , and these beams were tilted so that the long axis of the rectangle traced the plane of ngc 891 @xcite . for these cases , and again comparing against an assumed scale height of 9.1@xmath31 and integrated perpendicular to the plane , we calculate that 45% and 53% of the line flux was detected by the iso sws spectrometer .",
    "we apply these extra - planar corrections to both data sets for proper comparisons .",
    "we also must correct for flux not detected along the plane of the galaxy , since neither ours , nor the iso data sets are fully sampled .",
    "the iso sws slit along the plane of the galaxy ( point - to - point , along the diagonal ) was 34@xmath31 and 24@xmath31 for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines respectively . since",
    "the spitzer data are only sampled every 30@xmath27 , we must interpolate between spizer samplings to properly compare with the iso data . for both the s(0 ) and s(1 ) data sets , we interpolate linearly between the spitzer sampled regions , then integrate within a region covering the angular extent of the iso beam along the plane .",
    "this should be a good estimator for most of the galaxy , especially for the s(0 ) line , where the iso and spitzer beam sizes are nearly the same .",
    "a possible exception is the nucleus in the s(1 ) line , where the relatively much smaller spitzer beam may emphasize any strong central peak .",
    "figure 3b illustrates the comparison between spitzer and iso observations including all the effects described above . for the inner ( r @xmath35 7 kpc ) galaxy our spitzer line fluxes are about a factor 1.55 and 1.85 larger than those of iso in the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines respectively , but the spitzer s(1)/s(0 ) line ratio is not much different than the iso s(1)/s(0 ) ratio .",
    "therefore , we derive similar excitation temperatures for the inner galaxy as those presented in @xcite(see section 4.1.1 below ) .    however , in the outer galaxy ( r @xmath36 7 kpc ) the s(1)/s(0 ) line ratios diverge .",
    "the spitzer s(1 ) line flux does not fall off nearly as rapidly as that measured by iso , so that the spitzer / iso ratio grows to @xmath4 2.57 in the outer regions .",
    "in addition , the spitzer s(0 ) line flux falls off more rapidly in the outer galaxy than does the iso s(0 ) line flux , so that spitzer / iso ratio gets smaller , to @xmath4 0.81 in the outer regions .",
    "therefore , unlike our spitzer results , where the s(1)/s(0 ) line ratio is nearly constant over the disk , the iso results show a marked decrease in the s(1)/s(0 ) ratio for the 3 regions sampled at r @xmath36 7 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "it is this change in line ratios for the outer regions that led @xcite to invoke a second , cool gas contributor to the observed s(0 ) line emission .",
    "beam size is not the source of this discrepancy : since the iso beam has its diagonal along the plane of the galaxy , it was equally sensitive to extraplaner emission as the spitzer beam .",
    "furthermore , it is not just the added s(0 ) line flux in the outer disk , but it is also the dearth of s(1 ) line radiation in the outer disk reported in the iso observations that changes the observed s(1)/s(0 ) line ratio , hence the derived gas excitation .",
    "the nearly constant line ratios revealed by the spitzer observations are consistent with warm molecular gas , with near uniform excitation conditions over the galaxy - there is no evidence for an additional cool gas component .",
    "furthermore , as we will show below , this warm molecular gas component is far less massive ( @xmath3513% ) than the cold h@xmath26 emitting molecular component ( @xmath37 m@xmath2 ) invoked by @xcite .      to begin an analysis of mid - ir line emission from the edge - on galaxy ngc891 , we need to first make corrections for the non - negligible extinction in the lines due to dust along the line of sight .",
    "the h@xmath0 line emission is likely to be highly correlated with that of the co(1 - 0 ) line which is tightly confined to the plane of the galaxy , so that to make a good extinction correction , we need high spatial resolution proxies .",
    "fortunately , there exist high resolution images of ngc891 in the two primary tracers of the neutral ism  the hi 21 cm line which traces atomic hydrogen , and the co(1 - 0 ) line which traces cold molecular hydrogen .",
    "we calculate the total column density in the molecular gas and atomic gas components within our spitzer beams as a function of distance along the plane of the galaxy as follows .    for the co(1 - 0 ) distribution",
    ", we use the data contained in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained with a 2.3@xmath27 beam , but are plotted in their figure 2 by integrating the emission perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , then refering it to a 1@xmath27 strip along the plane . to compare with our data ,",
    "we therefore re - expand their strip to follow an exponential fall - off perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy with the local co(1 - 0 ) scale height ( also given in figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the observed scale height ( given as full - width - at - half - maximum ) varies and corresponds to a 1/e scale height ranging from about 2.9@xmath27 at the nucleus to @xmath4 4.3@xmath27 in the outer regions . for regions just exterior ( further removed from the nucleus along the galactic plane ) to those explored by @xcite ( r@xmath10200@xmath27 )",
    "we have added in the iram 30 m telescope ( 20@xmath27 beam ) observations of @xcite , scaled assuming the line emission follows the 4.3@xmath27 scale height observed in the outer galaxy by @xcite .",
    "we used a co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity to h@xmath0 column density conversion factor of x = @xmath38 @xmath39/(k km s@xmath40 ) as for the solar neighborhood @xcite @xmath39/(k km s@xmath40 ) , then the extinction corrected luminosities of the h@xmath0 lines go up 10% , and the overall calculated warm ( h@xmath0 line emitting ) to cold ( co(1 - 0 ) line emitting ) molecular mass fraction goes down to 11% from 16% ( see section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "the derived physical parameters of the gas , and its excitation mechanisms do not change significantly . ] , and derived an expected hydrogenic column density within 1@xmath27 strips parallel to the galactic plane with an exponential fall - off as given in @xcite .",
    "the hi column density is taken from the 21 cm line map of @xcite with a 7@xmath27 beam .",
    "since the scale height of the hi emission is relatively large ( @xmath4 6@xmath27 , @xcite , we estimate the hi column density within our spizer beams by direct inspection of the hi maps . note",
    "that since the hi column is a small fraction of the h@xmath0 column ( as traced by co ) in the the regions of the galaxy where extinction is important ( within @xmath4 5 kpc of the nucleus , see figure 4a ) , a more detailed model of the hi distribution is not warranted .",
    "the total neutral gas mass is nearly equally divided into molecular ( @xmath41 m@xmath2 , scoville et al .",
    "1993 ) , using x = @xmath38 @xmath39/(k km s@xmath40 ) , and atomic ( @xmath42 m@xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) components .",
    "we plot the calculated column density of hydrogen nuclei derived from the co and hi observations , smoothed to our s(0 ) beam size along the plane of the galaxy in figure 4a .",
    "the column plotted only includes mass within our spitzer beam which extends @xmath32 5.55@xmath27 perpendicular to the galactic plane : the mass missed at high galactic latitude is not included in this plot . the total column density of hydrogen nuclei within our beam peaks at @xmath43 @xmath39 at the nucleus and is above @xmath44 @xmath39 from -10 to + 10 kpc along the galactic plane .",
    "such large columns lead to sizable extinction even for the s(0 ) line at 28@xmath6 m . to find the extinction ,",
    "we take the column density of hydrogen nuclie as traced by the co distribution ( modeled as an exponential fall - off ) and the observed hi distribution within our beam to calculate the expected extinction as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "the extinction calculation is broken up into 1@xmath27 strips parallel to the plane .",
    "for each strip , we first find a@xmath45 , and then we calculate the local extinction correction , c(@xmath46 ) as defined below .",
    "we then average these extinction corrections within our beam to get an estimate for the total correction that must be applied to the observed h@xmath26 line emission .",
    "extinction is estimated using the `` galactic '' dust model of @xcite for which a(28@xmath6m)/n(h ) @xmath47 mag@xmath48 , a(17@xmath6m)/n(h ) @xmath4 a(12@xmath6m)/n(h ) @xmath49 mag@xmath48 , and make the correction for the higher gas to dust mass ratio observed in ngc891 ( 260 , see * ? ? ?",

    "we assumed a `` mixed '' extinction scenario , where the dust is mixed with the warm h@xmath0 gas , and for which the extinction correction , c(@xmath46 ) is given by c(@xmath46 ) = @xmath50(1 - e@xmath51)@xmath40 . at the nucleus",
    "we derive a ( beam averaged ) extinction correction for the s(0 ) line of c(28@xmath6m)@xmath41.38 , and for the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines c(12@xmath6 m ) , c(17@xmath6m)@xmath41.71 . the extinction correction as a function of offset from the nucleus",
    "is plotted in figure 4b .",
    "the correction is significant for much of the inner ( r < 5 kpc ) galaxy , and larger for the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines , so that the extinction correction will change the line ratios .",
    "the line fluxes change only gradually over the plane of the galaxy , and the slits likely enclose nearly all of the flux perpendicular to the plane .",
    "therefore , to find the total line luminosity , we simply integrate the line fluxes along the plane of the galaxy , interpolating in a linear manner between samplings .",
    "for both the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , this amounts to integrating the observations and multiplying by the ratio of the sampling interval to the beam size along the plane : 30/22.3 = 1.35 and 30/4.7 = 6.38 for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines respectively .",
    "the total line fluxes so obtained are f(s(0 ) ) @xmath52 w m@xmath53 , and f(s(1 ) ) @xmath54 w m@xmath53 . at a distance of 9.5 mpc ,",

    "the s(2 ) line is not as well sampled as the s(1 ) line due to sensitivity limits , but assuming the s(2)/s(1 ) line ratio for the detected positions ( @xmath4 0.59 ) is the same throughout the galaxy , the s(2 ) line luminosity would be @xmath57 l@xmath2 .",

    "the @xmath61 low j molecular hydrogen lines are therefore @xmath4 1.5 times as bright relative to the tir continuum when compared to the sample of 57 normal galaxies surveyed by @xcite who find a typical ratio near @xmath62 with a scatter of about a factor of two .",
    "correction for extinction before integrating along the plane ( factors of 1.16 , 1.32 , and 1.32 for the s(0 ) , s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines respectively , section 3.3 , above ) , which is bound to be more important for the edge - on ngc891 than for the typically less inclined galaxies in the @xcite sample , the total h@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath63 l@xmath2 or @xmath64 of the tir luminosity , or @xmath4 twice the typical values found in @xcite .    the question of line flux at high scale heights missed by the spitzer beam is more difficult to quantify . if the scale height derived by @xcite applies the flux we observe is roughly equal to that we miss at scale heights greater than that of our beam ( @xmath4 5.6@xmath27 ) .",
    "the missed ( high z ) emission summed over the three lines is in this case therefore @xmath58 l@xmath2 .",
    "the high - z emission would suffer very little extinction , so the the total luminosity in all three lines would be @xmath65 l@xmath2 in the case of a 9.1@xmath27 @xcite scale height . another estimate is presented by presuming the h@xmath26 scale height is the same as that of the co(1 - 0 ) line . since the co scale height is observed along the entire galactic plane , this is the correction we prefer .",
    "for this case , the flux exterior to our beam ( without extinction correction ) is just 16@xmath66 of the flux within our beam ( before extinction correction ) so that the total luminosity in all three lines is @xmath67 l@xmath2 .",
    "correcting for both extinction and extra - planar emission , the h@xmath0 luminosity is therefore @xmath68 to @xmath69 of the tir luminosity .",
    "to derive the physical properties of the emitting gas , we need to compute ratios between lines measured within different apertures . inspecting figure 3 ,",
    "it is clear that for the most part , the flux in the three lines changes gradually at the scale of lh slit length ( 22.3@xmath27 ) along the plane of the galaxy .",

    "the allowed values for g and n for this pdr plus shocks solution are shaded blue in figure 10 ( right ) .",
    "clearly there is now a large region of overlap between the pdr solution for the fir lines , and that for the h@xmath26 lines .",
    "this solution space is centered at about g@xmath460 @xmath32 40 , n@xmath4 5 + 5/-3 @xmath134 @xmath14 ( figure 10 , center ) .",
    "the revised filling factors are reasonably self - consistent with @xmath139 @xmath4 1.9 , and @xmath143 @xmath4 2.8 . with v@xmath147 25",
    "km s@xmath40 , there is significant cooling in other molecular hydrogen lines : the s(3 ) and s(4 ) lines are predicted to be 4@xmath47 and 4 times brighter respectively than the s(2 ) line .",
    "the total luminosity in the molecular hydrogen lines from the shocked gas would be very large : l@xmath148 l@xmath2 .",
    "for a 25 km s@xmath40 c - shock , the common cooling lines of [ oi ] and co are more than 100 and 15 times less important energetically than those of h@xmath0 , and h@xmath0o is predicted to have a total cooling @xmath4 that of h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a similar analyis of the region centered on the north - east ring has a solution centered on modestly enhanced excitation , g@xmath14980 , n@xmath150 @xmath14 , and requires somewhat higher area filling factors @xmath139 @xmath4 2.7 , and @xmath143 @xmath4 3.6 to account for the enhanced [ oi ] 63 @xmath6 m line emission there .",
    "leaving aside the question of the h@xmath0 excitation , we can assess the contribution of mechanical energy dissipation to the h@xmath0 emission , from the point of view of energetics .",
    "is the dissipation rate of the interstellar medium turbulent kinetic large enough to provide a significant contribution to the h@xmath0 emission ?",
    "various groups have discussed the dissipation of turbulence using numerical magneto - hydrodynamic simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . as in @xcite",
    ", one can rearrange equation ( 7 ) from @xcite to parameterize the energy released by the dissipation of turbulence per unit mass in terms of the dispersion of the turbulent velocity , v@xmath151 , and the scale length of energy injection , @xmath152 :    @xmath153    the default values for v@xmath151 and @xmath152 correspond to the upper end of the line width - size relation for giant molecular clouds in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we invoke shocks to account for 80% of the s(2 ) luminosity , and 25% of the s(1 ) line luminosity . by dividing the sum of these line",
    "luminosiites @xmath154 , by the molecular mass @xmath155 , derived from the co(1 - 0 ) luminosity , we obtain @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , the expected turbulent dissipation rate is greater than the luminosites of the lines , so that a significant contribution from turbulent energy dissipation is likely .    in summary ,",
    "the observed h@xmath26 line emission from ngc 891 is well fit by a model that combines a low excitation pdr ( g @xmath4 60 , n@xmath45@xmath157 10@xmath116 @xmath14 ) with dissipation of turbulent energy within molecular clouds .",
    "the ( adjusted ) [ oi ] ( 63 and 146 @xmath6 m ) and [ cii ] 158 @xmath6 m fine structure line fluxes , ( half ) of the observed fir continuum flux , the h@xmath26 s(0 ) line flux and 70@xmath66 of the s(1 ) line flux arise from the pdr component , while the h@xmath26 s(2 ) line and 30@xmath66 of the s(1 ) line flux arise from gas heated by turbulent dissipation .",
    "it is interesting to note that based on observations of the h@xmath0 lines along a line of sight within the milky way galaxy , @xcite reached much the same conclusion : the s(0 ) line emission may be accounted for by uv heated h@xmath0 in the diffuse interstellar medium and low excitation pdrs , but the uv emission can not be the unique energy source , because their pdr models fall short of the observed s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines by large factors ( @xmath42 - 10 ) .",
    "as we outline here , they propose that the s(1 ) and s(2 ) h@xmath0 line emission is powered by the localized dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , albeit in a low density gas ( n@xmath158 ) within the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the presence of a diffuse component of h@xmath0 line emission has been confirmed by additional galactic observations @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that the solutions presented here are by no means unique .",
    "on galactic scales there will certainly be a range of pdrs along the line of sight with varying degrees of excitation , that could mimic the observed line ratios , perhaps negating the need to invoke shocks .",
    "furthermore , a single parameter shock model is also simplistic : there will very likely be a superposition of shocks of various parameters only any given line of sight .",
    "what we present here is intended to be only a representative solution .",
    "we have mapped the distribution of the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , and s(2 ) pure rotational lines of h@xmath26 along the plane of the edge - on galaxy ngc891 .",
    "the lines are remarkably bright . after making an extinction correction ,",
    "the total line flux from the three transitions is @xmath159 l@xmath2 or @xmath40.09% of the tir luminosity of the galaxy . unlike the iso results that suggest a change in the s(1)/s(0 ) line intensity ratio in the outer regions of the galaxy",
    ", we find the line ratios are nearly constant along the plane of the galaxy indicating uniform excitation of the gas . in particular , there is no reason to invoke a massive cold component of the molecular gas in the outer galaxy as the iso results appear to require . through analytical modeling",
    ", we find the bulk of the mass traced in its h@xmath0 line emission has an excitation temperature near 125 k. this `` warm '' molecular component is a substantial fraction of the total molecular gas mass : about 10 to 15% in the inner ( 3 kpc ne @xmath35 r @xmath35 6 kpc sw ) galaxy rising to more than 30% in the outer regions .",
    "integrated over the galaxy , m@xmath16 @xmath4 16% m@xmath18 .",
    "we compare our h@xmath0 observations with detailed pdr models to show that the observed line intensities and ratios are consistent with high density ( n@xmath160 @xmath14 ) molecular clouds exposed to moderate far - uv fields ( g@xmath4200 - 400 ) .",
    "we refine our pdr modeling by using available iso [ oi ] and [ cii ] data , which indicate smaller far - uv fields ( g@xmath45 - 300 ) , and lower gas densities ( n@xmath161 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the solutions spaces for the h@xmath0 and fir line pdrs do not overlap , but a reasonably close solution is obtained for g@xmath4 200 , and a large ( factor of ten ) density gradient between the fir emitting gas and the h@xmath0 emitting gas",
    ". this solution may be possible if the clouds are externally illuminated , but the high field invoked by this solution is in contradiction to the more modest far - uv fields ( g@xmath162 ) one would expect by comparing the observed h@xmath0 line luminosity to that of the 7.7 @xmath6 m pah features .",
    "a consistent solution is obtained within a two component model .",
    "the first component is a low excitation pdr , with g @xmath4 60 , and the second component is heated by the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "we find a very good fit for the h@xmath0 and fir lines and continuum if all the observed s(0 ) line emission arises from the pdr component , and 80@xmath66 of the s(2 ) line arises from the turbulent component .",
    "the s(1 ) line emission is split 70% into the pdr component , and 30% into the turbulent component .",
    "this solution is only representative of a range of solutions that could be obtained by allowing more pdr and/or shock components with different excitation parameters .",
    "this is the first analysis of the h@xmath0 rotational line emission from a galaxy together with the fir lines and continuum in the context of pdr models .",
    "a complication with this modeling is the relatively large beams and modest sensitivies of the iso spectrometers for detection of the fir lines .",
    "these issues will become much less important in the near future with the arrival of fir data from the 3 m class stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) and the herschel space telescope spectrometers and photometers .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for many inciteful comments that led to a much improved version of this manuscript .",
