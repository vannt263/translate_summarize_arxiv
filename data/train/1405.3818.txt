    "our current microscopic understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei is based on two main approaches : using the nuclear shell model , on the one hand , and the energy density functional ( edf ) method , on the other hand .",
    "the real start of application of edf method to nuclear systems can be traced back to the early 1970s when vautherin and brink @xcite revived the effective skyrme interaction @xcite and proposed a local edf for nuclear systems . since then , a vast number of articles dealing with a skyrme - type edf have appeared , and this trend will certainly continue for the years to come .",
    "the main reason for this success is that the skyrme edf is a local functional , thus leading to local self - consistent mean fields .",
    "even the coulomb part of the skyrme edf was made local through the slater approximation for the exchange coulomb contribution @xcite .",
    "the validity of the slater approximation in skyrme edf calculations of atomic nuclei has been discussed in the literature @xcite , and it was found to be accurate at the level of a few percent throughout the mass table with better results for medium and heavy nuclei .    in the late 1980s a new type of edf became also very popular , namely the so - called relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach , which is essentially a relativistic hartree model with a no - sea assumption .",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon interactions were mediated by meson exchanges with adjusted coupling strengths . from walecka s toy model of the early 1970s",
    "@xcite it evolved into a sophisticated hartree - type description of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "later on , it was extended into a relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) version to take into account the effects of nuclear pairing . for the sake of numerical simplicity all exchange ( fock ) terms",
    "were dropped , their effects being hopefully taken care of by readjusting appropriately the meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the rmf and rhb approaches are generally quite successful @xcite and they are currently as widely applied as the non - relativistic skyrme - type edf approach",
    ". however , one aspect has been so far overlooked : the coulomb exchange effects are absent from the rmf description , although it is well known that they are non - negligible , especially in lighter systems ( the asymptotic behaviour of the coulomb mean field in a nucleus having @xmath0 protons is @xmath1 , but it is @xmath2 if only the hartree mean field is considered ) . in this contribution , we recall that a relativistic version of the slater approximation is at hand , based on a local density approximation ( lda ) for the coulomb exchange energy @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to a set of rmf - type equations where the coulomb part of the self - consistent mean field is a sum of a direct ( local ) coulomb potential , and an exchange coulomb potential which is also local .    the relativistic slater approximation for the coulomb exchange field would be very useful for the newly developed covariant point - coupling models @xcite where meson - nucleon vertices are assumed of the contact type .",
    "then , all nuclear and coulomb mean fields would contain exchange contributions and still remain local . in the rest of this short note",
    ", we will recall the main expressions which enable one to calculate the coulomb exchange energy and potential using the relativistic lda ( rlda ) , and then we comment on the first applications @xcite carried out recently with this method .",
    "in the non - relativistic mean field treatment of a finite nucleus having nucleonic densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 the hartree - fock ( hf ) single - particle wave functions for protons are solutions of schrdinger - type equations containing a coulomb mean field @xmath5 .",
    "this coulomb potential has a direct ( hartree ) component @xmath6 which is local , and an exchange ( fock ) non - local component @xmath7 .",
    "the lda consists in approximating the coulomb exchange energy density at point @xmath8 of the inhomogeneous system by that of a homogeneous system having a proton density value equal to @xmath4 .",
    "since the single - particle wave functions in a homogeneous medium are plane waves , the coulomb exchange energy per unit volume can be expressed in the simple form @xcite : @xmath9 under the lda assumption , the coulomb exchange energy of the finite system would then be @xmath10 this is the so - called slater approximation @xcite routinely employed in many self - consistent , non - relativistic mean field studies @xcite .",
    "it leads to a local potential representing the exchange ( fock ) coulomb potential : @xmath11    in the relativistic case , the coulomb energy is expressed again in terms of the proton density : @xmath12 and proton current : @xmath13 where ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are the dirac matrices , the @xmath16 are four - component spinors and the @xmath17 are occupation probabilities .",
    "the summations run only over the proton states belonging to the positive energy spectrum ( the no - sea approximation @xcite ) .",
    "then , the relativistic expressions for the direct and exchange coulomb energies are @xmath18}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are the single - particle energies .    in the relativistic homogeneous nuclear matter , the @xmath21 are plane wave solutions of the dirac equation , and the time - like and space - like components of @xmath22 per unit volume , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , can be related to the non - relativistic energies @xmath25 of eq .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) through @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 being the proton mass , whereas @xmath29 and @xmath30 are analytical functions of @xmath31@xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the coulomb exchange energy increase with the density , and they are substantial in atomic nuclei . on the other hand , it is sufficient to evaluate them by expanding @xmath32 and @xmath30 up to order @xmath33 . to that order , the coulomb exchange energy is @xmath34}\\,,\\ ] ] while the corresponding contribution to the single - particle potential for protons reads @xmath35",
    "recently , the rlda method for treating coulomb exchange effects was checked by comparing it with the full treatment of coulomb exchange in the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations @xcite .",
    "several isotopic chains were studied .",
    "coulomb exchange energies in pb isotopes calculated in rhfb approach with pka1 model @xcite ( black squares ) .",
    "the lda results calculated with the same proton density distributions @xmath36 but using the non - relativistic expression ( [ eqb ] ) ( resp . , relativistic expression ( [ eqk ] ) ) are shown by the nrlda ( resp .",
    ", rlda ) curves .",
    "the lower panel shows the percentage errors relative to the exact exchange energies.,width=302 ]    as an example of application , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the coulomb exchange energies @xmath37 calculated for the chain of pb isotopes .",
    "we have performed self - consistent rhfb calculations of these nuclei , and then extracted the values of @xmath37 corresponding to three choices : full rhfb ( labeled `` exact '' in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , non - relativistic lda ( nrlda , eq .  ( [ eqb ] ) ) , and relativistic lda ( rlda , eq .  ( [ eqk ] ) ) .",
    "these results show that ignoring completely the coulomb exchange energies introduces an error of several tens of mev which would have to be compensated artificially by readjusting the meson - nucleon couplings . on the other hand ,",
    "the very simple rlda expression shown in eq.(10 ) for the coulomb exchange energies in the @xmath38 isotopes is accurate at the level of about @xmath39  mev .",
    "thus , it would be an interesting improvement for models belonging to the rmf category to incorporate the coulomb exchange effects by the rlda method when adjusting the meson - nucleon couplings of the rmf lagrangians .",
    "all the self - consistent potentials ( including the exchange coulomb potential ) entering the dirac equations of the rmf would still remain local , but a major part of the coulomb exchange effects would be described by the local potential @xmath40 .",
    "there are presently attempts to construct effective lagrangians with point - coupling interaction vertices .",
    "such models can describe nuclear systems within a relativistic hartree - bogoliubov framework , and they can be generalized to rhfb form .",
    "the point - coupling assumption leads to local , self - consistent nuclear potentials and makes the dirac equations easier to solve numerically . for the coulomb interaction ,",
    "it is of course unreasonable to assume the point - coupling and a good strategy would be to handle fully the direct coulomb interaction while the exchange coulomb effects would be described by the @xmath40 potential , similarly to what is done with skyrme effective interactions .",
    "another observation that one can deduce from the comparison of the relativistic results of ref .",
    "@xcite with the study of non - relativistic slater approximation carried out by titin - schnaider and quentin @xcite using a skyrme - type edf is that the rlda method seems to give more accurate coulomb exchange energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath41@xmath42 region was explored , and it turned out that the non - relativistic slater approximation overestimates the coulomb exchange energies by @xmath43@xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative error due to the rlda is always less than @xmath45 ( and could be of either sign ) over a wide range of nuclides from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "thus , one has now a simple and efficient way to incorporate into rmf - type calculations , or more generally into rhfb models with point - coupling vertices , most of the effects due to coulomb exchange interactions among protons inside a nucleus .",
