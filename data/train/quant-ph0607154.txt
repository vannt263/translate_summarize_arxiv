    "many non - hermitian hamiltonians @xmath1 are known to possess real discrete spectra , e.g. @xcite , which make them potential candidates for physical systems . unlike as for hermitian hamiltonians @xmath2 , the conventional inner products of the corresponding wavefunctions are usually indefinite and the central problem in this context is to construct meaningful inner products serving to formulate a consistent quantum theory . besides from compensating wrong signs by hand @xcite , there are essentially three different , albeit in many cases equivalent , ways to achieve this : i ) by employing bi - orthonormal eigenstates @xcite , ii ) by constructing the so - called c - operator bender:2002vv , bender:2004sa or iii ) by restricting to pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians @xmath1 and constructing their hermitian counterparts @xmath2 related to @xmath1 by a similarity transformation @xmath3 most , weigert @xmath4 see also @xcite for an earlier discussion of these issues . in many respects",
    "the last possibility is the most direct and straightforward approach on which we will almost exclusively concentrate here .",
    "the natural starting point is usually a given non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 for which one needs to construct @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently one may formulate all relevant physical questions for the non - hermitian system in terms of the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics associated to the hermitian system .",
    "thus a key task in this approach is to find @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately this is only possible in some exceptional cases in an exact manner and otherwise one has to resort to perturbation theory .",
    "building on earlier work @xcite , we found in @xcite the closed expressions @xmath7}\\frac{g^{2n}(-1)^{n}e_{n}}{% 4^{n}(2n)!}c_{q}^{(2n)}(h_{0}),\\quad h = h_{0}-\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{[\\frac{\\ell + 1}{2}]}\\frac{g^{2n-1}\\kappa _ { 2n-1}}{(2n-1)!}c_{q}^{(2n-1)}(h_{0 } ) , \\label{hhh}\\ ] ] which are related according to ( [ sim ] ) perturbatively .",

    "has the condition @xmath16 for some finite integer @xmath17 the expressions ( [ hhh ] ) are exact and otherwise they are just correct up to the stated order in the coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 are euler s numbers and the @xmath20 may be constructed from them @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that , in practice , the above - stated procedure may lead to rather cumbersome relations involving commutators .",
    "this fact poses a major problem for determining closed formulae for specific isospectral pairs of hamiltonians , or for carrying out perturbative computations up to higher orders .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to propose a practical scheme for overcoming this difficulty .",
    "we elaborate further on a recent proposal by scholtz and geyer @xcite to solve ( [ sim ] ) by means of moyal products instead of computing commutators .",
    "the central idea is to exploit isomorphic relations between commutator relations and real valued functions multiplied by moyal products , which correspond to differential equations .",
    "we shall demonstrate that this approach is rather practical and allows to compute pairs of isospectral hamiltonians @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "moyal products are applied in a wide field of research , such as non - commutative(nc ) m - theory @xcite , nc - string theory seiberg:1999vs , nc - integrable field theories dimakis:1999nq , grisaru:2003gt , cabrera - carnero:2002wq , lechtenfeld:2004qh , etc . the key idea is to transfer the noncommutative nature of some operators to real valued functions .",
    "technically one may set up such an isomorphism in various different ways . in the present context of studying non - hermitian hamiltonians such possibilities",
    "have been exploited in @xcite .",
    "the authors defined the moyal product of real valued functions depending on the variables @xmath9 and @xmath23 as   @xmath24the classical , more widespread and symmetrical definition is , see e.g. moyal , fairlie:1998rf , carroll @xmath25or exchange the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath23 in ( [ mo1 ] ) .",
    "in order to achieve a proper isomorphism between the operator expressions and those computed with moyal products one requires different types of prescriptions to translate real valued functions into operator valued expressions .",
    "products computed with definition ( [ mo1 ] ) must be viewed as ordered products in which all @xmath26-operators are moved to the left of all @xmath27-operators . in expressions computed with definition ( [ mo2 ] ) on the other hand one should replace each monomial",
    "@xmath28 or @xmath29 by the totally symmetric polynomial @xmath30 in the @xmath31 operators @xmath32 and @xmath14 operators @xmath27@xmath33here @xmath34 indicates the sum over the entire permutation group .",
    "the simplest example to illustrate this is @xmath35=4i\\hat{p}\\hat{x}-2~~\\cong ~~x^{2}\\ast p^{2}-p^{2}\\ast x^{2}=4ipx-2~~\\cong ~~x^{2}\\star p^{2}-p^{2}\\star x^{2}=4ipx.\\]]we use here the standard canonical commutation relation @xmath36=i$ ] and throughout the paper we employ atomic units @xmath37 .",
    "we observe that the @xmath38-product yields the correct operator expression upon replacing @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41-product on the other hand corresponds to the correct commutation relations for @xmath42 .",
    "the defining relation ( [ mo2 ] ) is slightly more complicated than ( [ mo1 ] ) , but it is more symmetrical and leads therefore to cancellations of various terms as one can easily convince oneself . loosely speaking , it has the advantage that it incorporates already more of the noncommutative nature of @xmath27 and @xmath26 from the very beginning . as we shall see below ,",
    "this is the reason why it leads to simpler differential equations for the quantities we wish to determine .",
    "these statements are also supported by comparing the equations resulting from ( [ mo2 ] ) and ( [ mo1 ] ) for all examples calculated up to now with this method @xcite , definition ( [ mo1 ] ) yields @xmath43whereas ( [ mo2 ] ) gives the simpler form @xmath44 .",
    "let us now briefly discuss in general how we proceed to construct @xmath2 from a given @xmath1 by first solving ( [ sim ] ) for @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the explicit knowledge of @xmath5 is vital , since once it is known one may control the entire quantum mechanical formalism , such as inner products , observables , time evolution , etc .",
    "however , in general one can not compute @xmath45 exactly and has to rely on perturbative methods bender:2004sa , mostafazadeh:2004qh , ca in which one has to solve the commutator relations occurring in ( [ hhh ] ) order by order .",
    "this is a very cumbersome procedure and up - to - now it has only been carried out for few cases to lowest order . here",
    "we present a simple and more efficient scheme which leads to the exact determination of @xmath5 by employing moyal products .",
    "we build on suggestions of @xcite , but as a starting point we use instead of the definition ( [ mo1 ] ) the definition ( [ mo2 ] ) and write the second equation in ( [ sim ] ) isomorphically as @xmath46with definition ( [ mo2 ] ) this will then lead to a differential equation in @xmath6 , whose order depends on the degree of @xmath9 and @xmath23 in @xmath1 . in most cases",
    "this equation can not be solved exactly and under these circumstances we assume a perturbative expansion for @xmath6 in the coupling constant @xmath18 , which was introduced in ( [ h ] ) @xmath47combining ( [ he ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) then leads to a differential equation , which involves the functions @xmath48 in a recursive manner and can therefore be solved order by order",
    ". ultimately we aim at exact expressions , which yield @xmath6 to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "having then solved various differential equations , we naturally expect some ambiguities in the general solutions , which mirror the possibility of different boundary conditions .",
    "we would like to stress that this is not a drawback , which is only present when using moyal products , but it is rather a reflection of a general feature of perturbation theory .",
    "the same kind of ambiguity occurs in the perturbative approach based on commutators . in that context",
    "one may only fix the operator corresponding to the @xmath49 up to any operator which commutes with the hermitian part of @xmath1 , that is @xmath50 .",
    "this means that , in ( [ hhh ] ) , the expressions are insensitive to any replacement @xmath51 with @xmath52=0 $ ] . a further type of ambiguity , which is always present irrespective of an exact or perturbative treatment , is a multiplication of @xmath6 by operators which commute with @xmath1 , i.e. we could re - define @xmath53 for any @xmath54 , which satisfies @xmath55=0 $ ] .",
    "we may fix these ambiguities by invoking a further property of @xmath5 . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "assuming a dependence on the coupling constant @xmath18 of the form @xmath56will guarantee the pseudo - hermiticity relations ( [ sim ] ) .",
    "therefore we require next @xmath57which may be solved systematically order by order when we already know the expansion ( [ 3 ] ) up to the ambiguities . note that ( [ et ] ) is automatically satisfied if we take @xmath58 and @xmath59 as assumed in many cases on the grounds of pt - invariance @xcite .",
    "having determined @xmath60 the transformation @xmath5 is subsequently computed easily order by order from @xmath61when assuming a further power series expansion @xmath62finally , having obtained an explicit expression for @xmath5 , we may compute the hermitian counterpart to @xmath1 from ( [ sim ] ) as @xmath63according to the above arguments , i.e. the second equation in ( [ hg ] ) , we should find an expression of the general form @xmath64let us now illustrate the above with two explicit examples , by starting with one for which the differential equation may be solved exactly and thereafter complicating it to a case which requires perturbation theory .",
    "as a straightforward example we consider the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath66 which results from @xmath67 when using @xmath68 as transformation , @xmath69 and the introduction of the coupling constant @xmath18 to separate off the non - hermitian part @xcite .",
    "the exact similarity transformation @xmath5 for this hamiltonian was recently constructed by jones and mateo @xcite using perturbation theory in terms of commutators in the spirit of equation ( hhh ) .",
    "see also @xcite for further reasoning on how the hamiltonian ( aq ) can be used to make sense of the @xmath70-potential despite its unappealing property of being unbounded from below .    in order to illustrate the method",
    "let us see how to determine @xmath5 by using moyal products .",
    "first we notice that we wish to treat @xmath71 as a real valued function and we therefore have to replace the anti - commutator with the appropriate moyal products . when using definition ( [ mo2 ] ) we have to replace @xmath72 by @xmath73 and the differential equation ( [ he ] ) for the hamiltonian ( [ aq ] ) reads @xmath74 as a comparison we also present the differential equation resulting from ( [ he ] ) when using the @xmath38-product instead of the @xmath41-product . when converting the operator valued hamiltonians into a function , we have to pay attention to the fact that @xmath75 .",
    "thus  in @xmath1 we replace @xmath76 by @xmath77 @xmath78 , whereas in @xmath79 we substitute @xmath80 by @xmath81 @xmath82 , which is of course not the same as converting first the anti - commutator with a subsequent conjugation .",
    "the resulting differential equation reads @xmath83 obviously , equation ( [ d2 ] ) is more complicated than ( [ d1 ] ) , which illustrates our assertion that the @xmath41-product is more advantageous than the @xmath38-product .",
    "ultimately they should lead , however , to the same result .",
    "indeed , each line in ( [ d1 ] ) as well as ( [ d2 ] ) vanishes separately for @xmath84 which , when compensating a slight difference in convention , is precisely the same expression as found in @xcite . to find @xmath85 from @xmath86 by means of ( [ ee ] ) is trivial in this case as we just have to take the square root , i.e. @xmath87 . using ( [ hk ] ) thereafter we find the hermitian counterpart of @xmath1@xmath88 when setting the artificially introduced parameter @xmath18 to @xmath89 , we recover precisely the expression found in @xcite @xmath90 in @xcite also the interesting massive case @xmath91 has been discussed",
    "the transformation from the @xmath92-variable to the @xmath9-variable will add in ( [ aq ] ) a term @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting similarity transformation is then @xmath94 and the hermitian counterpart reads @xmath95 which for @xmath96 reduces precisely to the expression reported in @xcite .",
    "let us next embark on an example for which the differential equation ( d1 ) can not be solved exactly .",
    "the prototype example for the study of non - hermitian hamiltonian systems is the harmonic oscillator perturbed with a complex cubic potential @xmath97it was the discovery @xcite that this hamiltonian possesses a positive real discrete spectrum , which led to the current interest in this subject .",
    "this hamiltonian is obviously non - hermitian , but pt - invariant and pseudo - hermitian @xcite .",
    "the latter property means that the relations ( [ sim ] ) hold . for the hamiltonian ( [ qcube ] ) the conjugation relation ( [ he ] ) translates into the differential equation )",
    "yields @xmath98 ] @xmath99using the expansion ( [ ee ] ) we find the recursive equation @xmath100notice the occurrence of the aforementioned ambiguities .",
    "it is easy to see that we may add to @xmath49 any arbitrary function @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "this type of ambiguity just reflects the fact that in the perturbative formulation in terms of operators we may add to @xmath15 any function of @xmath102 .",
    "we write @xmath103 $ ] and determine first the functions @xmath104 which also obey ( [ ccc ] ) .    taking as the initial condition @xmath105 ,",
    "we find order by order    @xmath106    this can be expanded effortlessly to higher orders , but we will not report these functions here . next we demand the dependence on the coupling constant @xmath18 to be of the form ( [ et ] ) in order to fix the ambiguities . since we may add to @xmath107 any arbitrary function @xmath108\\,$ ] , due to the recursive equation ( [ ccc ] ) this function will produce descendents at higher level in @xmath48 for @xmath109 .",
    "thus we have the general form @xmath110.\\]]we can now use this function and achieve that ( [ et ] ) is satisfied order by order .",
    "explicitly , @xmath111=\\tilde{c}_{2}(x , p)+% \\frac{8}{9}h_{0}^{3}-4h_{0}.\\end{aligned}\\]]as we note , indeed the additional function just depends on @xmath112 . in a similar fashion we can compute the higher order functions @xmath113we observed that always @xmath114=0 $ ] . making next the ansatz ( [ eet ] ) , we compute the @xmath115 by reading off the corresponding powers in the expression ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "we find order by order @xmath116finally , having obtained an explicit expression for the @xmath5 , we may compute the hermitian counterpart to @xmath1 from ( [ hk ] ) .",
    "we find order by order @xmath117where we have already converted from real valued functions to operators .",
    "notice that @xmath118 is of the form ( [ hh ] ) and as we expect all terms @xmath119 , such that indeed the second relation in ( [ hg ] ) holds .",
    "up to @xmath120 our results agree precisely with hj .",
    "higher orders do not seem to appear in the literature .",
    "we have shown that moyal products can be used as a very powerful tool to compute the similarity transformation @xmath5 relating a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 to its hermitian counterpart @xmath2 . as concrete examples , we have applied such products to a situation for which @xmath5 can be calculated exactly , namely the non - hermitian @xmath121 potential , and to a case for which it can only be computed perturbatively , that is the harmonic oscillator with a complex cubic perturbation . in the latter case",
    ", we profited considerably from the fact that the moyal products involve only real - valued functions , instead of commutators , and lead to differential equations which can be solved recursively .",
    "relation ( [ et ] ) was crucial to fix the ambiguities , which result from operators which commute with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath112 .    in a more general context , this is a far less cumbersome procedure than those involving commutators , and allows one to evaluate isospectral pseudo - hermitian ",
    "hermitian pairs perturbatively up to a very high order .",
