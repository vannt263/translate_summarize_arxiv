    "the introduction of a positive cosmological constant in the einstein equations of general relativity gives rise to a wide variety of new interesting solution spacetimes , in particular , spacetimes containing both `` black hole '' and `` cosmological '' regions .",
    "as in the case of black - hole spacetimes with vanishing cosmological constant , the stability of these spacetimes as solutions to the einstein equations is a fundamental open problem of gravitational physics . yet",
    "even the simplest questions concerning the behaviour of linear waves on such spacetime backgrounds today remain unanswered . in this paper",
    ", we initiate in the above context the mathematical study of decay for solutions to the linear wave equation .",
    "the simplest family of black - hole spacetimes with positive cosmological constant is the so - called _ schwarzschild - de sitter _ family .",
    "if the cosmological constant @xmath2 is considered fixed , this is a @xmath3-parameter family of solutions @xmath4 to the _ einstein vacuum equations _",

    "mass_. we shall consider only the non - extremal black - hole case , corresponding to parameter values @xmath7    as with the schwarzschild family , the first manifestation of the schwarzschild - de sitter family of solutions was an expression for the metric in local coordinates , in this case first published in 1918 by kottler  @xcite , and independently by weyl  @xcite , in the form @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the standard metric on the unit @xmath10-sphere . the global structure of maximal spherically symmetric vacuum extensions of such metrics was only understood much later  @xcite based on the methods of formal penrose diagrams introduced by b.  carter . in fact , maximally extended spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes @xmath4 with various different topologies can be constructed , all of which equally well merit the name `` schwarzschild - de sitter with parameter @xmath6 and cosmological constant @xmath11 '' .",
    "such solutions @xmath4 all share the property that the universal cover @xmath12 of the @xmath10-dimensional lorentzian quotient @xmath13 consists of an infinite chain of regions as depicted in the penrose diagram below : @xmath14 the results of this paper do not depend on the topology , and for definiteness , one may assume in what follows that the name `` schwarzschild de - sitter '' and the notation @xmath4 refer to the spacetime with quotient precisely the universal cover depicted above .",

    "the statement of theorem  [ gendata ] should be compared with the results of our previous  @xcite concerning the wave equation on a schwarzschild exterior .",

    "this leads us to try to exploit compatible currents . in this section",
    ", we will describe this general approach , and the natural relation of the currents we will define with various geometric and analytical aspects of the problem at hand .      for quasilinear hyperbolic systems ( like @xmath17 ) in @xmath144 dimensions ,",
    "all known techniques for studying the global dynamics are based on @xmath57 estimates . in the lagrangian case ,",
    "the origin of such estimates can be understood geometrically in terms of _ compatible currents _ ( see christodoulou  @xcite ) .",
    "these are @xmath3-forms @xmath145 such that at each point @xmath146 , both @xmath145 and the divergence @xmath147 depend only on the @xmath3-jet of @xmath1 .",
    "an important class of these are the currents @xmath148 obtained by contracting the energy momentum tensor @xmath149 with an arbitrary vector field @xmath150 .",
    "see section  [ ccsec ] for a discussion in the context of the linear wave equations @xmath0 studied here .",
    "all estimates in this paper are obtained by exploiting the integral identities @xmath151 corresponding to compatible currents of the form @xmath148 and straightforward modifications thereof @xmath152 , where the vector fields @xmath153 are directly related to the geometry of the problem , and the region @xmath154 is suitably chosen .      the timelike hypersurface @xmath156 is known as the _ photon sphere_. this has the ominous property of being spanned by null geodesics . if additional regularity is not imposed , then it is clear by a geometric optics approximation that solutions of the wave equation can concentrate their energy along such geodesics for arbitrary long times , and one can thus not achieve a quantitative bound for the rate of decay in terms of initial energy alone . in particular , @xmath95 can not hold for @xmath157 if @xmath158 is replaced by @xmath159 .",
    "it is truly remarkable that this obstruction arising from geometrical optics is captured , and quantified , by a current @xmath145 associated to a vector field @xmath153 of the form @xmath160 for a well - chosen function @xmath161 .",
    "the story is not entirely straightforward , however .",
    "the desired current is in fact not precisely of the form @xmath148 , but a modification thereof , to be denoted @xmath162 , which is associated in a well defined way to a collection of vector fields @xmath163 .",
    "the current is defined by summing over currents @xmath164 which act on individual spherical harmonics @xmath63 .",
    "the current @xmath165 yields a nonnegative @xmath166 , modulo an error term supported near the horizons . in a first approximation , we may pretend that in fact @xmath167 , but degenerates ( in regular coordinates ) near the horizon .",
    "the identity @xmath168 can then be used as an estimate for its left hand side , in view of the fact that its right hand side will in fact be bounded by the flux of @xmath169 , for the killing field @xmath170 , which is conserved .",
    "the role of the photon sphere will be exemplified by the degeneration at @xmath156 of the quantity controlled by this spacetime integral .    in order to obtain decay results from the above",
    ", one would have to gain information about the quantity estimating the boundary terms ",
    "namely @xmath171 , from the control of spacetime integral .",
    "the difficulty for this is that the spacetime integral estimates one obtains degenerate at the photon sphere @xmath156 and at the horizons .",
    "this does not allow one to control @xmath172 there .",
    "the problem at the photon sphere is cured by applying the estimate also to angular derivatives .",
    "it is here that the argument `` loses '' an angular derivative .",
    "it is this loss that leads to the form of decay proven in @xmath95 .",
    "the problem on the horizon , on the other hand , turns out to be illusionary .",
    "the horizon is in fact a very favourable place for estimating the solution ! for this , we will need to consider the `` local observer '' vector fields @xmath173 , @xmath174 , to be described in the next section .      the heuristic mechanism ensuring decay near the horizons has been understood for many years , and is known as the _ red shift effect_. this is typically described in the language of geometric optics .",
    "if two observers @xmath177 and @xmath178 cross the event horizon at advanced times @xmath179 , and @xmath177 sends a signal to @xmath178 at a certain frequency , as he ( @xmath177 ) measures it , then the frequency at which @xmath178 receives it is exponentially damped in the quantity @xmath180 .",
    "it turns out that this exponential damping property can be captured by the integral identities @xmath168 corresponding to the currents @xmath181 and @xmath182 associated to vector fields @xmath173 , @xmath183 , defined in section  [ ysec ] .",
    "these vector fields are supported near the horizons @xmath119 , @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "the estimates @xmath168 corresponding to the currents @xmath181 , @xmath182 fulfill the double role of ( a ) correcting for the error region where @xmath184 by dominating this term near the horizon by @xmath185 and ( b ) controlling the spacetime integrated energy measured by local observers near the horizon . the choice of @xmath173 , @xmath183 is delicate , because there is an `` error region '' where @xmath186 , which must be controlled with the help of the currents of the previous section .",
    "the use of the currents corresponding to @xmath187 , @xmath173 and @xmath183 are thus strongly coupled .      to see the above arguments in context ,",
    "the reader may wish to compare with our previous  @xcite , where versions of the currents @xmath155 , @xmath175 are also employed .",
    "the relation of our arguments with the physical mechanisms at play are in fact much clearer in the present paper , than in  @xcite .",
    "this is due on the one hand to the absence here of the morawetz - type vector field ( denoted @xmath188 in  @xcite ) , and , on the other hand , to the relative simplicity here in the construction of the current @xmath155 .",
    "we give here some comments on these points .",
    "the morawetz vector field employed in  @xcite is a highly unnatural quantity at the horizon from the geometric point of view . on the other hand , in view of its weights",
    ", it somewhat magically captures a polynomial ( as opposed to the proper exponential ) version of the red shift .",
    "the pointwise decay rates achieved via @xmath188 at the horizon are worse than the decay rates away from the horizon , but sufficient if one is only interested in the behaviour of the solution away from the horizon .",
    "( see also  @xcite . ) in our  @xcite , uniform decay rates up to the horizon were indeed obtained with the help of @xmath175 . but these estimates could be obtained _ a posteriori_. from the point of view of the non - linear stability problem , this decoupling appears to be an exceptional feature .",
    "it is in this sense that the scheme proposed in the present paper is perhaps more naturally connected to the geometry of general black holes .    the second point to be made here",
    "concerns the construction of @xmath155 . in  @xcite ,",
    "positivity of the analogue of what we denote here @xmath166 relied on an unmotivated recentring and rescaling of the derivatives of the functions @xmath189 which obscured perhaps the fundamental connection with the photon sphere . here",
    ", this connection appears much more clear .",
    "of course , this is at the expense of having to bound @xmath190 from @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "this should in no way be thought of as a disadvantage .",
    "the red - shift effect has a lot to offer . it should be used and not obscured .",
    "as noted above , the study of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to @xmath0 on both schwarzschild and schwarzschild - de sitter backgrounds has a long tradition in the physics literature . in the schwarzschild case , the pioneering heuristic study is due to price  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite . for the schwarzschild - de sitter case ,",
    "there is numerical work of brady et al  @xcite , the subsequent  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the above studies are based entirely upon decomposition of @xmath1 into spherical harmonics .",
    "the results of these heuristics or numerics are typically presented in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the tail : @xmath193 for schwarzschild , where @xmath194 is fixed in the first formula , @xmath195 in the second , and @xmath196 in the third , and @xmath197 for schwarzschild - de sitter and @xmath140 , where @xmath198 is fixed in the first formula , and @xmath195 in the second , and @xmath199 in the third .    at first glance ,",
    "statements @xmath200 may appear stronger than what is actually proven in theorem  [ second ] . as quantitative statements of decay , however , statements @xmath201 and @xmath200 are in fact much weaker than what has now been mathematically proven , here and in  @xcite . for , rewriting ,",
    "in particular , the first formula of @xmath200 as @xmath202 depends on , indeed , if there is any bound on @xmath203 provided by some norm of initial data , and if so , what is the behaviour as @xmath204 .",
    "this does not concern a mathematical pathology , but is intimately connected with the physical effect caused by the photon sphere . indeed , a geometric optics approximation shows easily that if @xmath205 is to hold and if @xmath203 is to depend , say , on the initial energy of the spherical harmonic , then @xmath206 as @xmath207 .",
    "_ it is the rate of this divergence that would then determine the decay rate ( if any ) for @xmath1 .",

    "our  @xcite gives an alternative proof not relying on the discrete symmetries of the maximal development .",
