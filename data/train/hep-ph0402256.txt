    "the physics of high energy proton / deuteron  nucleus collisions has acquired new vigor with on - going experiments on deuteron - gold collisions at center of mass energies per nucleon of @xmath2  gev being conducted at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "first results from these experiments have already been submitted for publication and presented at conferences  @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) will study proton - nucleus collisions with center of mass energies per nucleon of @xmath3 tev  @xcite . when one considers this important increase in the energy range for these collisions , it is interesting to examine how results from lower energy proton - nucleus collisions are modified both qualitatively and quantitatively as one goes to higher energies .    at very high energies , or small @xmath1 values ,",
    "the relevant parton densities in the proton and in nuclei grow very rapidly .",
    "if these densities are sufficiently large , the parton distributions may saturate ,  @xcite leading to a qualitatively different behavior of the distributions .",
    "saturation will occur sooner in nuclei than in protons because the large number of nucleons give rise to an enhanced parton density in the transverse plane by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions therefore , for a wide energy range , provide an attractive physical environment wherein the proton probe may be considered as a dilute parton gas with properties that are believed to be well understood while the nucleus exists in a novel , saturated high density state . this latter state has been called a color glass condensate ( cgc ) and its distinctive features have been extensively explored  @xcite .    in this work , we will formulate a description of high energy proton - nucleus collisions within the cgc framework . in this framework ,",
    "the proton and the nucleus are effectively described as static random sources of color charge on the light - cone . the leading contribution to particle production",
    "is obtained by calculating the classical yang - mills field created by these sources and then averaging over a random distribution .",
    "thus on is led to solve the yang - mills equations in the presence of two number densities of color charges , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively for the proton and the nucleus , localized on the light - cone  .",
    "one has @xmath7=j^\\nu\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 operators calculated in this classical background field have to be averaged over weight functionals @xmath9 and @xmath10  representing the distribution of the densities of color charges in the proton and nucleus respectively .",

    "this averaging procedure is essential in order to restore gauge invariance since @xmath12 $ ] is computed in a particular gauge .",
    "the arguments @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the scale in @xmath1 separating the large @xmath1 static sources from the small @xmath1 dynamical fields .",
    "it is also through @xmath9 and @xmath10 that quantum effects , due to evolution with @xmath1 of the light - cone wave functions of the target and projectile , are incorporated .",
    "the functionals @xmath9 and @xmath10 obey a wilson renormalization group equation ( often called the jimwlk equation  @xcite ) , which governs their evolution with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this equation reduces to the well - known bfkl equation in the low density or large transverse momentum limit . in this paper",
    ", we will explicitly show that the physical quantities relevant for proton - nucleus collisions can be related to correlators of wilson lines , the quantum evolution of which can be studied thanks to the jimwlk equation .",
    "the first part of this work , on gluon production in pa collisions , will be presented in this paper .",
    "the second part , on quark production , will start from the solution of the yang - mills equations obtained in the present paper and will be discussed in an accompanying paper  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ym - derivation ] , we show how the yang - mills equations can be truncated systematically in order to obtain a coupled set of equations for the gauge fields to first order in the proton source density @xmath15 and to all orders in the nuclear source density @xmath16 .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as the parton densities in the proton remains small : this is of course the case at moderate collision energies , but also at very high collision energies albeit in a more restricted kinematical domain ( not too far away from the fragmentation region of the proton ) .",
    "gauge invariance is preserved , by construction , in this truncation .",
    "we explore the structure of these truncated equations and introduce a convenient diagrammatic expression for the gauge fields .",
    "the equations are solved explicitly in section [ sec : ym - solution ] .",
    "we obtain a compact expression for the gauge fields in terms of two distinct wilson lines whose coefficients are shown to be simply related to the well known effective lipatov vertex  @xcite .",
    "classical gluon production is discussed in section [ sec : glue - prod ] .",
    "it is shown explicitly how the results can be written in a @xmath0-factorized form as the product of two @xmath0-dependent distributions times a factor proportional to the square of the lipatov vertex .",
    "the results obtained in this fashion are compared to the results of dumitru and mclerran @xcite in fock - schwinger gauge and are shown to be identical . in section [ sec : cronin ] , we show how the cronin effect arises in simple models with and without quantum evolution of the color charge densities .",

    ", we find interesting ramifications for our understanding of the physics from both d - au and au - au experiments at rhic as well as for the future heavy ion experiments at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "various technical details are included in appendices a and b. finally , we comment on the relation of results in our approach to the glauber multiple scattering formalism . since this is somewhat outside the main thrust of this paper , we discuss it in a self - contained fashion in appendix [ sec : glauber ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] and set the stage for the results on quark production to be presented in @xcite .    before we proceed further",
    ", we should point out that several results on gluon production in this paper are not new .",
    "they were first derived , in covariant gauge , by kovchegov and mueller  @xcite and subsequently refined in later papers  @xcite .",

    "( we should also mention the work of braun in a somewhat different approach  @xcite . ) our derivation , albeit also in covariant gauge , follows a different tack from the feynman diagram technique of kovchegov and mueller .",

    "[ eq : sources ] .",
    "the expressions for the gauge fields are derived explicitly and one observes how the lipatov vertex arises in this approach .",
    "we also show , for the first time , the exact equivalence between the approach of kovchegov and mueller with that of dumitru and mclerran .",
    "our results for the gauge fields are new and will be useful in deriving the result for quark production , which will be discussed in  @xcite ( henceforth referred to as paper ii ) .",
    "our discussion of the cronin effect is also , in part , known from previous work by us and other authors  @xcite .",
    "our results in the `` super - saturated '' limit are new and help clarify the interpretation of the rhic data . the fact that one recovers the glauber multiple scattering picture in the case where the correlations of the color sources are gaussian",

    "one first solves the classical yang - mills equations in the presence of the light - cone sources @xmath15 and @xmath16 , next one computes the observable of interest in this classical field , and finally one averages over the sources @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for proton - nucleus collisions ,",
    "one requires the solution of the gauge field to lowest order in the source density @xmath15 of the proton and to all orders in the nuclear source density @xmath16 .",
