    "the spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at high energies ( @xmath33 kev ) provide important information on the physics of the nuclear region .",
    "unfortunately , the limited sensitivity of current and past x  ray missions has usually restricted the investigation to bright agns .",
    "little is known about the hard x  ray properties of low luminosity agns .",
    "this problem concerns particularly seyfert 2s , since they are generally weaker than their type 1 counterparts . yet , the hard x  ray properties of type 2 seyferts are most interesting , since they provide important information on the obscuration affecting this class of objects .",
    "several observational data indicate that type 2 seyfert nuclei suffer significant obscuration along our line of sight .",
    "the nature of the obscuring medium is matter of debate .",
    "the unified model ( antonucci @xcite ) ascribes the obscuration of sy2 nuclei to a gaseous pc - scale circumnuclear torus . according to this model sy1s and sy2s",
    "would be identical physical objects , while the orientation of the line of sight with respect to the torus would be responsible for the obscuration of the blr and of the nuclear engine ( x  uv source ) in type 2 seyferts .",
    "hard x  ray spectra are probably the best observational tool to directly measure the absorption affecting sy2 nuclei .",
    "indeed , sy2 spectra in the 210 kev range show evidence for a power law component similar to that observed in sy1s ( photon index @xmath4 1.7 ) and a cutoff due to photoelectric absorption .",
    "the latter indicates absorbing column densities between @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath2 ( e.g. awaki @xcite , ueno et al .",
    "@xcite , smith & done @xcite , turner et al .",
    "@xcite ) , often ascribed to the obscuring torus .    in some sources",
    "the absorbing column density is so high ( n@xmath7@xmath2 ) that it is optically thick to compton scattering . in this case",
    "the direct component is completely absorbed in the 210 kev range .",
    "however , the nuclear radiation can be compton reflected by cold material surrounding the x  ray source ( possibly the same torus responsible for the obscuration ) or scattered by free electrons in a highly ionized warm gas .",
    "if these media extend outside the absorbing torus , then signatures of the x  ray nuclear activity are observable via the reflected / scattered continuum .",
    "also , the cold reflecting medium produces a fluorescence iron line at 6.4 kev , while he and h  like iron in the warm scattering medium should emit lines at 6.7 and 6.96 kev .",
    "since the direct continuum is completely suppressed in compton thick sources , these iron lines are characterized by equivalent widths ( @xmath8 kev ) larger than in sy1s or in compton thin sy2s . until a few years ago",
    "ngc1068 was the only compton thick source known .",
    "a few more sources of this class have been discovered recently ( see matt @xcite for a review ) .    as anticipated above , sy2s in early spectroscopic studies",
    "were mostly selected from former all  sky x  ray surveys , hence these studies were generally biased for x  ray bright objects .",
    "very likely , this selection criterion resulted in a bias in favor of low n@xmath9 sy2s .",
    "later on , hard x  ray spectroscopic studies ( mostly by means of asca ) probed fainter samples of agns ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "however , many of the sy2s observed by asca were selected amongst sources known to show broad lines in polarized light ( awaki et al .",
    "this selection criterion might introduce a bias for low n@xmath9 as well .",
    "heisler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the detectability of polarized broad lines is related to the obscuration of the nuclear region .",
    "summarizing , former x  ray spectroscopic surveys were seriously biased against heavily obscured sy2s and , therefore , they are not suitable to study the real distribution of the absorbing column densities n@xmath9 .",
    "the knowledge of the distribution of n@xmath9 in sy2s is important to understand the nature of their obscuring medium , which has implications for the unified model .",
    "also , the distribution of n@xmath9 is relevant to the synthesis of the x  ray background .",
    "indeed , obscured agns are thought to contribute to most of the high energy ( @xmath3 2 kev ) extragalactic background ( comastri et al .",
    "@xcite , madau et al .",
    "we have undertaken a program of observations with bepposax , the italian  dutch x  ray satellite , aimed at studying the hard x  ray properties of weak sy2s and at assessing the `` real '' distribution of their absorbing column densities .",
    "as described in the next section , bepposax is an excellent tool to pursue this goal , since it combines high sensitivity ( required to observe weak agns ) and a wide spectral coverage ( 0.1300 kev , required to identify and disentangle various spectral components ) .",
    "sy2s suitable for this study were drawn out of maiolino & rieke s ( @xcite ) sample .",
    "this sample is extracted from the revised shapley - ames ( rsa ) catalog of galaxies ( that is limited to magnitude @xmath10 , sandage & tammann @xcite ) , and seyfert galaxies are selected according to their optical lines . as discussed in maiolino & rieke ,",
    "this sample is much less biased than others , both in terms of luminosity of the seyfert nuclei and in terms of properties of their host galaxies . out of the 54 sy2s in the maiolino & rieke sample 22",
    "have already been observed by asca .",
    "we selected 8 of the remaining 32 sy2s , based on their [ oiii]5007 ( narrow ) line flux : to maximize the chances of detection we chose the sources showing the highest [ oiii ] flux .",
    "maiolino & rieke also show that , although the [ oiii ] line is emitted on scales much larger than the putative pc - scale torus , the [ oiii ] is not a completely isotropic indicator of the nuclear luminosity , for the host galaxy disk might obscure part of the nlr .",
    "however , once the [ oiii ] flux is corrected for the extinction deduced from the balmer decrement , it should provide an indication of the nuclear activity that is independent of the pc - scale obscuration due to the torus . as a consequence , although our [ oiii]-based selection criterion might introduce a bias in our sample for _ intrinsically _ luminous sources , it avoids biases against highly obscured sy2 nuclei , thus overcoming limitations of former surveys .",

    "we report and discuss results of bepposax observations for all of the 8 seyfert 2s in our [ oiii ] selected sample .",

    "we rebinned the spectra to have a minimum of 10 counts per channel ( source @xmath19 background ) , so that statistics can be treated in the poissonian limit and the energy resolution is not affected significantly .",
    "we did not detect short term variability in any of our sources .",
    "however , the signal  to  noise is too low to provide stringent constraints since these sources are weak and the integration times relatively short .",
    "we used three models to fit the observed continuum .",
    "1 .   transmission model ( compton thin ) .",
    "it consists of a power law ( similar to that observed in sy1s ) transmitted through an absorbing cold medium .",
    "2 .   warm scattering model ( compton thick ) .",
    "this model assumes that the primary power law is completely absorbed along our line of sight by a medium that is thick to compton scattering .",
    "however , the primary radiation is scattered into our line of sight by a warm , highly ionized gas located outside the absorbing medium . as a consequence ,",
    "this model consists of a power law with no absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "3 .   cold reflection model ( compton thick ) . as in model 2 , here the primary radiation",
    "is completely absorbed along our line of sight by compton thick material .",
    "however , in this model the primary radiation is compton reflected into our line of sight by a cold , neutral material in the circumnuclear region , possibly identified with the same torus responsible for the obscuration . in this case , the spectral model consists of the `` hump '' characteristic of the cold reflection . in the 210 kev range ,",
    "the continuum is much flatter than the primary radiation .    since the sources in our sample are weak , several of our spectra have low signal  to  noise ratio in the continuum .",
    "therefore , we reduced to the minimum possible the number of free parameters .",
    "in particular , we froze the photon index @xmath20 of the continuum to 1.7 in all models .",
    "this is the average photon index in sy1 galaxies and it is thought to arise from a primary power law with photon index 1.9 flattened , in the 2 - 20 kev range , by a cold reflection component due to reprocessing by the accretion disk ( nandra & pounds @xcite ; nandra et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    however , to allow for a comparison with other studies in the literature where @xmath20 is a free parameter , in the appendix we also report results of transmission model fits with this additional degree of freedom .    in most cases",
    "the extrapolation of the continuum model fitted at high energies ( @xmath21 kev ) falls short of accounting for the emission in the soft x ",
    "ray range ( @xmath22 kev ) .",
    "therefore , we also introduced a black body component ( kt @xmath23 a few 0.1 kev ) to account for this `` soft excess '' .",
    "the black body is just an analitical form that fits nicely the spectrum below @xmath24 kev , but it does not necessary reflect the real nature of this flux ; this will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ disc_soft ] .",
    "however , only data above 3 kev were used to statistically discriminate between the transmission , warm scattering and cold reflection models , so that the @xmath25 were little affected by the soft excess .    in all models",
    ", galactic photoelectric absorption is included .",
    "the hard x  ray spectrum of seyfert galaxies is usually characterized by a fluorescent line at 6.4 kev produced by low ionization iron ( i.e. iron with no vacancies in the l  shell , and then less ionized than fe xvii ) . also , in some cases ( e.g. ngc 1068 , ueno et al .",
    "@xcite ) recombination / resonant emission from he  like ( 6.7 kev ) and h  like iron ( 6.96 kev ) is observed .",
    "our fit includes an unresolved gaussian , whose central energy is left free , to account for the iron line . in some cases there",
    "are indications that the iron line is resolved ; in these cases we tried to fit the line with two gaussians centered at 6.4 + 6.7 kev ( neutral and he  like iron ) or at 6.4 + 6.96 kev ( neutral and h  like iron ) .",
    "the two - components fit was considered significant only if the @xmath25 probability improved at a confidence level of at least 90% .    the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fluorescence 6.4 kev fe k@xmath26 line provides useful information to constrain the column density that absorbs the continuum and , in some cases , to distinguish between the compton thick and the compton thin cases .",
    "this fluorescence line is thought to arise from the accretion disk ( lightman & white @xcite ; fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ) and , possibly , from the torus as well ( ghisellini et al .",

    "cold absorbing column densities n@xmath28@xmath2 do not change significantly the observed ew(fe k@xmath26 ) , since the photoelectric cutoff occurs at energies lower than 6 kev .",
    "the presence of an absorbing medium with n@xmath29 depresses the continuum beneath the iron lines and , if the line is produced by material more extended than the obscuring medium , the ew increases .",
    "moreover , line photons are produced in the absorber itself , whose ew may be significant provided that the covering factor is large enough .",
    "ew(fe k@xmath26 ) @xmath30 1 kev is characteristic of purely reflected / scattered spectra and , therefore , indicates complete absorption of the primary radiation , and then is used to identify compton thick candidates . interpreting ew(fe k@xmath26 ) @xmath3 1kev with a compton thin , low absorption model would require an iron gas abundance several times higher than the cosmic value ( e.g. matt et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the k@xmath26 lines from he and h  like iron ( 6.7 and 6.96 kev",
    "respectively ) are emitted from highly ionized gas .",
    "their ew with respect to the scattered component can be as high as a few kev ( matt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while , if the primary radiation is visible , they are likely to be diluted to invisibility . therefore ,",
    "detection of lines with ew(fe@xmath31 ) @xmath32 1 kev is a clue that the primary radiation is heavily absorbed , i.e. n@xmath7@xmath2 .",
    "however , determining the properties of the obscuring material and of the scattering medium from the ew of these high ionization lines presents more uncertainties than the 6.4 kev line .",
    "indeed , the intensity of the he and h lines depends non linearly from the optical thickness of the scattering gas .",
    "also , starburst activity can increase the intensity of these lines . on the other hand cases where the 6.76.96 kev lines dominate",

    "various authors have also used other methods to determine the nuclear absorption along our line of sight and , specifically , to distinguish between compton thin and compton thick sources . by assuming the unified model correct , the ratio between the hard x  ray luminosity and an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic luminosity should provide indications on the amount of absorption affecting the nuclear x  ray source .",

    "( in prep . ) , where the spectra of several sy2s ( including the ones in this paper ) are collected and analyzed .",
    "in compton thick seyferts the nuclear continuum can be observed only when scattered by a warm , highly ionized mirror , or compton reflected by a cold neutral medium ( possibly the molecular torus ) . since",
    "our survey has significantly enlarged the number of known compton thick sy2s , it is now possible to statistically assess the relative importance of the cold versus warm scattering in this class of objects .    by merging our sample with compton thick sources previously reported in the literature",

    "the apparent overabundance of cold reflection dominated compton thick sources must probably be ascribed to the low efficiency of the free electron scattering process .",
    "indeed , in the latter case the fraction of scattered light is given by    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the free electron column density and @xmath123 is the solid angle subtended by the warm mirror .",
    "the average opening angle of the light cones in sy2s is @xmath124 ( maiolino & rieke @xcite ) . if we assume that the warm mirror in sy2s is the analogous of the warm absorber observed in sy1s , then @xmath125@xmath2 ( reynolds @xcite ) .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] this implies that the scattering efficiency of the warm mirror is only @xmath126 , i.e. significantly lower than the typical efficiencies observed in compton thick sources",

    "those ( few ) compton thick objects whose spectrum shows evidence for a warm scattered component could either be characterized by an anomalously high column density of the warm mirror , or the compton reflected component could be significantly absorbed along our line of sight ; the latter case might occur if the putative torus is edge  on .",
    "most of the objects in our sample show an emission below @xmath24 kev in excess of the extrapolation of the high energy spectrum . such soft x ",
    "ray excesses are commonly observed in type 2 seyferts and have been studied by several authors .",
    "this component is usually not observed in type 1 seyferts , presumably because the low absorption affecting them makes their flat power law component overwhelming .",
    "the nature of the soft excess in type 2 seyferts is not clear yet .",
    "there are two possible origins : 1 ) thermal emission from hot gas in the narrow line region , or 2 ) emission associated to starburst activity in the host galaxy ( x  ray binaries , supernova remnants , starburst driven superwinds ) .",
    "the possibility that the observed soft excess is due to the primary agn radiation scattered by a warm medium is not favored based on energy budget arguments ( wilson & elvis @xcite ) .    our data are not well suited to study the emission below 3 kev , since at low energies other satellites ( rosat , asca ) are much more sensitive .",
    "however , the wide spectral coverage of our bepposax data enables us to determine what fraction of the soft x ",
    "ray emission is contributed by the flat agn component extrapolated to low energies , and what fraction , instead , is actually due to an extra component .",

    "<S> we present observations in the 0.1100 kev spectral band of 8 seyfert 2 galaxies , obtained by means of bepposax . </S>",
    "<S> these sources were selected according to their [ oiii ] optical emission line flux , to avoid biases against obscuration on the pc scale . </S>",
    "<S> all sources were detected . </S>",
    "<S> all of them are weak x  ray emitters , and most of them are characterized by prominent iron lines at 6.47 kev ( ew@xmath0 ev ) and by a flat continuum , indicative of heavy obscuration along our line of sight ( n@xmath1 @xmath2 in most cases ) . these results </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) provide further evidence in favor of the unified scenario , and 2 ) indicate that the average obscuration of type 2 agns is very likely much higher than deduced by former x  ray surveys . </S>",
