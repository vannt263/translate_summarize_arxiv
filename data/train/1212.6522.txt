    "we observed slightly steeper spectrum than kz - spectrum slope . in the area",
    "@xmath76 the spectrum can be approximated by @xmath77 .",
    "this deviation from pure kz - slope @xmath78 can be explained by the influence of wave breaking and white capping effects  @xcite .",
    "the spectra are presented in figures  [ figure9],[figure10 ] .",
    "the spectral lines in this series of experiments were still narrow for @xmath80 . in the area of significant damping @xmath81 we observed intensive formation of slave ( bond ) harmonics ( see figures  [ figure12]-[figure16 ] ) .                in the last series of experiments we completely eliminated low - frequency dissipation @xmath82 .",
    "in this case we observed formation of intensive inverse cascade leading to creation of the condensate at @xmath83 .",
    "the spectrum in the area of inverse cascade was the same as in the previous series of experiments , while in the area of direct cascade we observed the phillips spectrum @xmath84 instead of a weak - turbulent kz - spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the spectra are presented in figures  [ figure17],[figure18 ] .        in order to check that spectrum slope is not changing any more ,",
    "long time calculation was performed on a smaller grid , which showed motion of the condensate position by one wave - number grid step without any significant influence on the inverse cascade region .",
    "the average steepness was essentially higher than in the previous experiments reaching its `` limiting value '' @xmath85 ( see figure  [ figure19 ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that the difference with the previous case , which looks quite small in absolute value ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , is really quite strong , because the dissipation rate depends strongly on the average steepness in this range of values  @xcite as well as probability of white capping grows pretty fast  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the steepness of the condensate was quite moderate @xmath88 ( it is worth to note , that average steepness getting significant contribution from small scales , quite far from the spectral peak , which means that often used definition of the average steepness through the product of mean amplitude and wave - number of spectral peak can deviate significantly from the geometrical definition through the average slope of the surface ) .",
    "however modulation of the short waves by long waves caused intensive micro - breaking of waves which forms the phillips spectrum ( the process described qualitatively in  @xcite ) .",
    "the most interesting and important question is about the shapes of spectral lines in the area of phillips spectrum .",
    "they are presented in figures  [ figure20]-[figure24 ] . for this experiment we analysed the longest time series which resulted in higher frequency resolution . after obtaining the frequency spectrum we used moving averaging in order",
    "to get rid of noise .",
    "one can see that in the most interesting area @xmath76 the spectral lines are still narrow while essentially `` contaminated '' by the slave harmonics .",
    "the maxima of the spectral peaks are shifted to the high - frequency area according to the theoretically predicted nonlinear frequency shift . in the area of shorter waves @xmath89 the spectrum is a chaotic mixture of leading and slave harmonics .",
    "we believe that our experiments make possible a `` marriage of heaven and hell '' in spirit of william blake .",
    "both outstanding scientists  o.phillips and k.hasselmann are right .",
    "if the local steepness @xmath0 is small ( @xmath90 ) the hasselmann kinetic equation is valid without any augmentation by any additional dissipation terms . for @xmath0 significantly higher than @xmath91 , in the area of very short waves the kinetic equation is not applicable in its `` pure '' form .",
    "it is impossible to separate `` leading '' and `` slave '' harmonics in this area .",
    "this part of the ocean spectrum can not be described analytically by the use of perturbative methods .",
    "nevertheless , the phillips spectrum in this area is still applicable .",
    "the only theoretical reason for this statement is dimensional considerations supported by experimental data . at the same time",
    "we claim that there is a `` grey area '' , which is especially interesting , because it is containing most of energy and generate most of steepness , where micro - breaking have equal foot with weakly nonlinear resonant waves interaction .",
    "spectra in this area could be described by an `` augmented '' hasselmann equation , including an additional term describing dissipation energy due to wave - breaking .",
    "similar additional `` dissipation terms '' @xmath92 are widely used in well developed operational wave forecasting models .",
    "but they are introduced `` out of the blue '' and not supported neither by theoretical consideration nor by experimental observations . moreover , it is not clear _ a priori _ that one can use the hasselmann kinetic equation in a situation where wave - breaking events are frequent enough .",
    "we hope that our experiments showed that this is possible .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition of applicability of the hasselmann equation is narrowness of the spectral line . in the present article",
    "we assert that in the `` grey area '' with a frequency range in one half of the decade the frequency spectra of harmonics are still narrow lines .",
    "it means that the hasselmann equation is applicable there .",
    "of course it must be augmented by a proper dissipative term .",
    "the existing and widely used dissipative terms hardly can be correct .",
    "they do not satisfy to the minimal requirement  the hasselmann equation in the presence of this term has to have the phillips spectrum as an exact solution .",
    "hence , the urgent problem is a construction of a `` really good '' dissipative term .",
    "one possible and hopefully plausible variant was recently offered by  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the dissipation term on the average steepness was recently measured directly from the numerical experiment , the preliminary results can be found in  @xcite . in our next paper",
    "we shall analyse what information about possible shape of the dissipative term can be extracted from massive numerical experiments .",

    "<S> we investigate applicability of the hasselmann kinetic equation to the spectrum of surface gravity waves at different levels of nonlinearity in the system , which is measured as average steepness . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that even in the case of relatively high average steepness , when phillips spectrum is present in the system , the spectral lines are still very narrow , at least in the region of direct cascade spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to state that even in the case of phillips spectrum the kinetic equation can be applied to the description of the ensembles of ocean waves .    </S>",
    "<S> two really seminal papers were published in the area of physical oceanography about half a century ago . </S>",
    "<S> we mean the article by  @xcite and the work of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both of them were concentrated on the same problem : what is going on with ocean waves growing under influence of wind ?    </S>",
    "<S> o.phillips suggested that this growth is arrested by wave - breaking , in other words by formation of `` white caps '' ( or `` white horses '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> wave breaking is the main mechanism of energy dissipation . in `` white caps '' mechanical energy of waves transforms to turbulence on small scales , then to heat . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strongly nonlinear phenomenon which can not be studied by perturbative methods . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical theory of wave breaking is not developed yet . </S>",
    "<S> the phillips assumption on predomination of wave - breaking effects made him possible to offer , on the base of dimensional considerations , the universal energy spectrum of wind driven waves , so called phillips spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> k.hasselmann developed a completely different theory . </S>",
    "<S> he noticed that a typical ensemble of ocean waves hoards a small parameter  </S>",
    "<S> average steepness ( slope ) of the surface @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one can define it , for instance , as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the shape of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this definition has the most clear geometrical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> another definition estimates it as average amplitude @xmath3 of the waves multiplied by wave - vector of the spectral peak @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this definition is easy to use for experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> later we shall consider another definition , which involves spectral distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> all these definitions give very close values of the average steepness . </S>",
    "<S> typically @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact allows to assume that the wind - driven sea is a community of weakly interacting waves , which can be described statistically by the use of expansion in powers of average steepness @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a tedious procedure because one have to expand up to order @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however k.hasselmann coped with this hard work and derived his famous hasselmann kinetic equation for squared wave amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> then it was found that hasselmann equation has exact stationary solutions ( kolmogorov - zakharov or kz spectra )  @xcite decaying at high frequency region slower than phillips spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a question arises which theory is more correct ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is given by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> numerous measurements made in lakes and ocean showed that the real spectrum is a combination of weak - turbulent kz spectra and the phillips spectrum . if @xmath7 is spectrum peak frequency , in the energy containing range @xmath8 kz spectra are realized , while the phillips spectrum predominates in the high - frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has the following explanation . </S>",
    "<S> wave turbulence in the wind driven sea is a mixture of weak and strong turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this is a question of phase correlation . </S>",
    "<S> weakly nonlinear interaction provides correlation of waves phases on large scales  hundreds of characteristic wavelengths . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the wave breaking and white capping is the localized phenomenon . as a result looking at the wind driven sea one observes formation of short living localized wave breaking events embedded into homogeneous weakly nonlinear background .    similar situation , coexistence of weak turbulence and localized coherent structures , is typical for wave turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> it takes place , for instance , in nonlinear optics  @xcite where optical turbulence coexists with self - focusing or in isotropic plasma where weak langmuir turbulence coexists with langmuir collapses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar phenomena were observed recently in numerical simulations for gravity waves  @xcite . in all these situations </S>",
    "<S> the usual course of action is to augment corresponding kinetic equations of weak turbulence by introduction of an additional term , describing dissipation of energy in the coherent structures ( corresponding to white capping onsets )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question is it still reasonable to use kinetic equation as an adequate model of waves interaction in the presence of coherent structures ?    in this paper we give positive answer to this question . to do this </S>",
    "<S> we perform massive numerical simulation of primordial dynamical equations describing potential flow of euler equations of ideal fluid with a free surface . in our numerical experiments we studied fourier spectra of space - time correlation function of normal canonical variables describing the surface dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our goal was to determine the `` shape of the line '' , i.e. frequency spectra of certain spatial fourier harmonics . according to the theory of weak turbulence </S>",
    "<S> these spectra must be narrow and concentrated near the frequency given by the dispersion relation for waves of small amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the following important result  in a broad range of wave numbers the spectra remain narrow even in the presence of wave - breaking events , when the spatial spectrum obeys the phillips law . </S>",
    "<S> this result opens a door to construction of a properly justified dissipation term which can be used thereafter in wave prediction operational models . </S>"
