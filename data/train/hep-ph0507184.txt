    "to study processes involving heavy quarkonia , such as decay and production mechanisms , in field theory , all the information needed can be parameterised by vertex functions , which describe the coupling of the bound state to its constituents and contain the information about the size of the bound state , the amplitude of probability for given quark configurations and the normalisation of the bound - state wave functions .    in a parallel work  @xcite , we have have considered production processes of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at hadron colliders .",
    "we relied on a phenomenological approach with vertex functions , and after restoration of gauge invariance , we have reached an interesting agreement with production cross sections and polarisation measurements by cdf  @xcite and phenix  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath4 ,",
    "we have used the leptonic decay width to fix the normalisation of these vertex functions .",
    "this procedure has appeared as robust and reliable for 1s states  @xcite and is explained in the following . however in the case of radially excited states , an important feature has emerged from calculations : the decay width , and thus the normalisation , are strongly dependent on the position of the node appearing in the vertex function .",
    "this ambiguity in the determination of the decay width might also exist for hadronic decays , such as @xmath5 , and is perhaps closely related to the @xmath0 puzzle .",
    "our approach to build the quarkonium vertex functions does not rely on the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite ( bse ) , usually used to constrain the properties of vertex functions ; for example , to relate the mass of the bound state to the mass of its constituent quarks . indeed , besides problems with gauge invariance , all predictions coming from bse are realised within euclidean space ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) and we have shown that the continuation to minkowski space can be problematic  @xcite .    we have therefore chosen to describe the quarkonia by a phenomenological vertex function and decided to remain in minkowski space , at variance with other phenomenological models ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the price to pay for not using bse is an additional uncertainty due to the functional dependence of the vertex .",
    "fortunately , it can be cancelled if one fixes the normalisation from the study of the leptonic decay width , which is our main concern here .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) that other dirac structures than @xmath6 for vector bound state are suppressed by one order of magnitude in the case of light mesons , and that this suppression is increased for the @xmath7 meson .",
    "therefore their effect is expected to be even more negligible in heavy quarkonia .    as a consequence ,",
    "the following phenomenological ansatz for the vector meson vertex , inspired by spin - projection operators , is likely to be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "it reads : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the total momentum of the bound state , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the relative one , @xmath12 as drawn on fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_vertex_phenoa ] .",
    "this ansatz amounts to multiplying the _ point _ vertex ( corresponding to a structureless particle ) by a function , @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 , which is called the 3-point vertex function , can be chosen in different ways .",
    "two simple anstze are commonly used in the context of bse .",
    "we consider both .",
    "they correspond to two extreme choices at large distances : a dipolar form which decreases gently with its argument , and a gaussian form : @xmath15 both with a free size parameter @xmath16 . as @xmath13 in principle",
    "depends on @xmath11 and @xmath9 , we may shift the variable and use @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 which has the advantage of reducing to @xmath19 in the rest frame of the bound state .",
    "we refer to it as the _ vertex function with shifted argument_. in the latter cases , we have in that frame ,    @xmath20      as is well - known , the number of nodes in the wave function , in whatever space , increases with the principal quantum number @xmath21 .",
    "this simple feature can be used to differentiate between @xmath22 and @xmath23 states .",
    "we thus have simply to determine the position of the node of the wave function in momentum space .",
    "to what concerns the vertex function , working in the meson rest frame , the node comes through a prefactor , @xmath24 , which multiplies the vertex function for the @xmath22 state .",
    "explicitly , @xmath25 , for a node @xmath26 , reads @xmath27    in order to determine the node position in momentum space , we can use two methods .",
    "the first is to fix @xmath26 from its known value in position space , _",
    "e.g. _  from potential studies , and to fourier - transform the vertex function . in the case of a gaussian form ,",
    "this can be carried out analytically .",
    "the second method is to impose the following relation and @xmath23 wave functions . ] between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 vertex functions : @xmath28 the two methods give compatible results .",
    "the width in terms of the decay amplitude @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the two - particle phase space  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is obtained as usual through feynman rules , for which we use our vertex function at the meson - quark - antiquark vertex . at leading order",
    ", the square of the amplitude is obtained from the cut - diagram drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_diag_1 ] .    in terms of the sub - amplitudes @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_diag_1 ] , we have : @xmath35 where the factor @xmath36 results from the sum over polarisations of the meson and the factor @xmath37 accounts for the averaging on these initial polarisations .      to what concerns the sub - amplitude @xmath38 , from the feynman rules , and after integration on the two - particle phase space , we have @xmath39=(ie)^2 \\frac{2\\pi}{3 } m^2\\underbrace{\\left[g^{\\rho\\rho'}-   \\frac{p^\\rho p^{\\rho'}}{m^2}\\right]}_{\\delta^{\\rho\\rho'}}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for @xmath32 , from the feynman rules and using the vertex functions discussed above , we have ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : decay_diag_1a ] ) @xmath40 @xmath41 is the heavy quark charge , @xmath42 comes for the fermionic loop , @xmath43 is the colour factor .",
    "we can easily motivate our choice of the argument of the vertex function , beside its simple relation with that of wave functions .",
    "its main virtue is to regularise the integration in all spatial directions . in the meson rest frame , the @xmath44 integral",
    "can be done by standard residue techniques , and the remaining @xmath45 integral is guaranteed to converge .",
    "if one uses @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 as an argument , it is possible to show that along the light cone , one obtains logarithmic divergences , which would presumably need to be renormalised . besides",
    ", the @xmath44 integral then also becomes dependent on the singularity structure of the vertex function .",
    "these two reasons make us prefer the shifted vertex in our calculation .",
    "a notable simplification can be obtained by guessing the tensorial form of @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , current conservation ( gauge invariance ) for the photon can be expressed as :    @xmath48 it is equivalent to @xmath49 the coefficient @xmath50 being @xmath51 since @xmath52 .",
    "this assumption can be easily verified in the bound - state rest frame @xmath53 for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : gi_amunu ] ) reduces to @xmath54 .",
    "we shall check this at the end of this calculation .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to compute the following quantity , where we set @xmath55 and define @xmath56 , @xmath57    let us first integrate on @xmath58 by residues . defining @xmath59 , we determine the position of the pole on @xmath58 ( still in the bound - state rest frame ) as @xmath60    to calculate the integral on @xmath58 , we choose the contour as drawn in fig .  [ fig : k0_plane ] .",
    "two poles @xmath61 and @xmath62 are located in the upper half - plane and the two others in the lower half - plane .",
    "we shall therefore have two residues to consider .",
    "the contribution of the contour @xmath63 vanishes as @xmath64 tends to @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66\\\\ & = \\frac{-3e_q}{\\pi^3 } \\int_0^\\infty k^2 dk \\gamma(-k^2)\\frac{2i\\pi}{4me } \\underbrace{\\left[-\\frac{2em+2m^2}{e+\\frac{m}{2}}+\\frac{2em+2m^2}{e-\\frac{m}{2}}\\right ] } _ { \\frac{m(4e^2 + 2m^2)}{e^2-\\frac{m^2}{4}}}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the procedure is correct only if the poles of the upper - plane are on the left side and those of the lower - plane are on the right .",
    "this crossing would first occur between the points @xmath62 and @xmath67 . solving for @xmath68",
    ", we have : @xmath69 the crossing is therefore impossible when @xmath70 . therefore , to get a coherent description of all charmonia ( resp .",
    "bottomonia ) below the open charm ( resp .",
    "beauty ) threshold , we shall set the quark mass high enough to avoid crossing for all of these .",
    "this sets @xmath71 to 1.87 gev ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 to 5.28 gev ( @xmath74 ) . considering the variety of results obtained from potential models",
    ", this seems to be a sensible choice .",
    "putting it all together , we get @xmath75 one is left with the integration on @xmath76 for which we define the integral @xmath77 depending on the vertex function whose normalisation is pulled off , @xmath78 @xmath77 is a function of @xmath16 through the vertex function @xmath79 and is not in general computable analytically . in the following",
    "we shall leave it as is and express @xmath32 as : @xmath80    finally , to what concerns the sub - amplitude @xmath81 , we simply have @xmath82      now that all quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomp_ampl_inv_decay ] ) are determined , we can combine them .",
    "hence , we obtain satisfies @xmath83 and @xmath84 . ] : @xmath85    the leptonic decay width eventually reads from  eq .",
    "( [ eq : lept_width ] ) : @xmath86      the value of @xmath87 is in practice obtained by replacing @xmath88 by its measured value , @xmath41 by @xmath89 for @xmath90 quark and @xmath91 for @xmath92 quark and , finally , by introducing the value obtained for @xmath77 for the chosen value of @xmath16 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +     +    we have chosen the range of size of the mesons , or @xmath16 , following bse studies  @xcite and other phenomenological models  @xcite , where the commonly accepted values for the @xmath1 are from around @xmath94 to @xmath95 gev , and for the @xmath4 from around @xmath96 to @xmath97 gev . for illustration , we put in  tab .",
    "[ tab : res_norm_meth2 ] several values of @xmath16 obtained with bse  @xcite , accompanied with the vertex - function normalisation .      to what concerns the @xmath2 , we give the results for @xmath16=1.8 gev , @xmath100 gev and a gaussian vertex function ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : normalisation_psip_290305 ] ) .",
    "the normalisation @xmath101 diverges for @xmath102 gev .",
    "this comes from the cancellation of the leptonic decay width for this value of @xmath26 .",
    "this cancellation can be traced back to the integrand of @xmath77 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) ) , which we note @xmath103 ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : didk ] ) .",
    "the cancellation of the positive contribution by the negative one therefore occurs in this case for @xmath104 gev .    the constraint for the node position  eq .",
    "( [ eq : ortho_1s_2s ] ) gives @xmath105 gev for these values of @xmath16 and @xmath71 .",
    "for this value of @xmath26 , the normalisation @xmath101 is 16.36 .",
    "this was the value that we have retained for the numerical applications of  @xcite .",
    "in the case of the hadronic decay @xmath5 , we expect it to proceed via an off - shell @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psip_rho_pi ] ) .",
    "the integral @xmath77 involving the @xmath2 vertex function will be slightly different and might be , for the same value of @xmath26 , drastically suppressed .    we can therefore expect a severe suppression of the decay amplitude compared to the nodeless , _",
    "@xmath1 , case .",
    "this suppression could in turn explains the @xmath0 puzzle , namely that the measured ratio @xmath107 is not of the order of 15 % ( expected from the leptonic decays ) but rather smaller than 1% .",
    "we have explained our approach to describe on a phenomenological basis the internal dynamics of heavy quarkonia in the context of a feynman - diagram calculation .",
    "we have also provided a way to represent the distinct features of @xmath23 states , like the @xmath2 .",
    "we have seen that a simple but robust constraint on the vertex functions for @xmath22-states could be achieved by imposing that their normalisation reproduces the leptonic decay width , through a simple leading order calculation .",
    "an interesting simplification can be also obtained by shifting the argument of the vertex function , namely the relative momentum of the quark inside the quarkonium , into a quantity that reduce to the tri - dimensional relative momentum in the meson rest frame .",
    "this enable us to work out analytically , for whatever vertex function , the integration on @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the leptonic decay width was very dependent on the node position , which , incidentally , is not a completely constrained parameter .",
    "this induces the same effects on the normalisation ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : normalisation_psip_290305 ] ) .",
    "this has consequences on production processes where our approach to describe internal dynamics of heavy quarkonia can be applied ( see  @xcite )",
    ". it should be interesting to see whether this happens for other excited states .",
    "finally , we suggest that this feature typical of radially excited states could be the awaited explanation for the longtstanding @xmath0 puzzle .    this work is supported by a iisn ( interuniversity institute of nuclear science , belgium ) research fellowship and has been done in collaboration with j.r .",
