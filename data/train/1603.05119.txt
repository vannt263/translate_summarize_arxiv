    "in 1958 , kautz  @xcite observed that the vertices of an induced path in a hypercube can be used as code words in gray codes detecting single - bit errors .",
    "applications of such codes date back to the 19th century , where they were used in telegraphy .",
    "they are nowadays used in many areas of mathematics , computer science and engineering , such as error correction in digital communication , disk sector encoding , clock domain crossing , computer network topologies and in the design of genetic algorithms , just to name a few ; we refer to drapela  @xcite for background information .",
    "the effectiveness of a gray code depends on its length .",
    "hence , the central research question is :    _ how can we find a longest induced path in a hypercube ?",
    "_    kautz coined the name `` snake - in - the - box '' for this problem .",
    "the snake - in - the - box problem has been extensively studied in the literature , just as its variant `` coil - in - the - box '' , where the goal is to determine a longest induced cycle instead of a path .",
    "as we shall discuss , the lengths of a longest snake and a longest coil are not known for any hypercube of dimension larger than  8 .",
    "the problem of finding a longest induced path is np - hard even for bipartite graphs  @xcite , but its complexity for hypercubes is still unknown . as exhaustive search is too time consuming , a variety of computational and mathematical techniques have been used to find lower bounds for these problems .",
    "see drapela  @xcite for details on these techniques .    in this note",
    "the main aim is to show three new lower bounds for snake - in - the - box and four new lower bounds for coil - in - the - box .",
    "we do this in section  [ s - new ] after first giving the required terminology in section  [ s - terminology ] .",
    "examples meeting our lower bounds are presented in the appendix .",
    "our methods are based on the stochastic beam search method , which is a general heuristic search method that was recently used by meyerson et al .",
    "@xcite to improve lower bounds for both snake - in - the - box and coil - in - the - box .",
    "we will explain our modifications to their algorithm in full detail in a future paper .",
    "a graph @xmath3 is an _ induced subgraph _ of another graph @xmath4 if @xmath3 can be obtained from  @xmath4 by a sequence of vertex deletions . for @xmath5 , the _ path _",
    "@xmath6 on @xmath7 vertices is the graph with vertices @xmath8 and edges @xmath9 .",
    "the _ cycle _ @xmath10 is the graph obtained from @xmath6 by adding the edge @xmath11 .",
    "we say that @xmath6 and @xmath10 are of _ length _ @xmath12 and @xmath7 , respectively . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube @xmath14 is the graph that contains @xmath15 vertices , each of which is represented by a binary vector of length @xmath0 , such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their binary vectors differ by exactly one bit .",
    "snake _ is an induced subgraph of @xmath14 that is a path , and a _ coil _ is an induced subgraph of @xmath14 that is a cycle .",
    "the snake - in - the - box problem is that of finding a longest snake in @xmath14 for a given integer  @xmath0 and the coil - in - the - box problem is that of finding a longest coil in @xmath14 for a given integer  @xmath0 .",
    "both problems have also been investigated for other graph classes ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "besides snakes and coils , a number of variants and generalizations , such as symmetric coils  @xcite ( also known as doubled coils ) , @xmath16-snakes and @xmath16-coils  @xcite , and single - track circuit codes  @xcite have been studied . however , in this section we will only focus on the original notions of snakes and coils and we restrict our overview to exact or lower bounds for snake - in - the - box and coil - in - the - box for hypercubes of small dimensions , that is , we will consider @xmath0-dimensional hypercubes for @xmath17 .",
    "we refer to , for example ,  @xcite for upper bounds for these two problems .    for @xmath18 , both snake - in - the - box and coil - in - the - box have been solved exactly :    * for @xmath19 , kautz  @xcite determined a longest coil . using exhaustive search ,",
    "davies  @xcite found a longest snake for @xmath20 and a longest coil for @xmath21 . * for @xmath22 , potter ,",
    "robinson , miller and kochut  @xcite used a genetic algorithm to find a longest snake and kochut  @xcite used exhaustive search to find a longest coil . * for @xmath23 , stergrd and pettersson used canonical augmentation to find a longest snake  @xcite and a longest coil  @xcite .    for @xmath24 ,",
    "only lower bounds for the length of a longest snake or coil are known .",
    "these lower bounds have been improved over the years and the state of the art results are as follows :    * for @xmath25 , wynn  @xcite proved that the length of a longest snake and coil is at least 190 and 188 , respectively . * for @xmath26 ,",
    "kinny  @xcite showed that a longest snake has length at least  370 and meyerson et al .",

    "the results of abbott and katchalski  @xcite from 1991 are still unbeaten .",
    "the same authors also showed a general lower bound by showing that for each @xmath30 , a longest coil has length at least @xmath31 .",
    "we refer to table  [ t - survey ] for an overview of the currently best lower bounds on the length of a longest snake or coil for every @xmath17 .",

    "note that the lower bounds on the provided snakes for @xmath34 are deduced from the lower bound on the length of a longest coil .",
