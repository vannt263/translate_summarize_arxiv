    "it is well established that hybrid metallic structures can sustain a non - vanishing supercurrent even if they contain a non - superconducting region located in - between two superconducting reservoirs .",
    "the physical reason for that is transparent : cooper pairs passing through this region can maintain their macroscopic quantum coherence and , hence , their ability to carry a non - dissipative current through the whole structure .",
    "this is the celebrated dc josephson effect which was initially predicted for superconducting tunnel junctions @xcite and later investigated in other types of superconducting weak links , such as , e.g. , quantum point contacts @xcite and superconductor - normal - metal - superconductor ( @xmath0 ) junctions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to tunnel junctions containing insulating barriers with typical thicknesses of few angstroms , in @xmath0 systems at sufficiently low temperatures appreciable supercurrent can flow even through a normal layer as thick as few microns .",
    "the latter feature is generic in both limits of ballistic @xcite and diffusive @xcite metals irrespective of the quality of @xmath2-interfaces ranging from poor @xcite to perfect @xcite .",
    "quantitative agreement between theory and experiment was demonstrated in diffusive @xmath0 junctions with ideal @xcite and non - ideal @xcite @xmath2-interfaces .",
    "for a comprehensive coverage of this and other issues related to dc josephson effect in different types of superconducting weak links we refer the reader to the review papers @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that all the above results apply provided the effect of electron - electron interactions remains weak and can be neglected .",
    "however , the situation may be different in sufficiently small superconducting junctions in which case coulomb effects can play an important role and need to be taken into account . in the case of tunnel barriers between superconductors",
    "coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling results in a large number of qualitatively new features which have been studied in a great detail @xcite . with increasing barrier transmission coulomb effects",
    "remain qualitatively the same though decrease in magnitude and eventually vanish in the limit of fully open barriers between superconducing electrodes @xcite .",
    "one can also consider the effect of coulomb interaction on the josephson current in more complicated superconducting weak links , such as , e.g. , diffusive @xmath0 junctions with low transmission @xmath2-interfaces .",
    "for instance , the authors @xcite addressed this problem within the so - called capacitance model assuming that coulomb interaction merely occurs across tunnel barriers at inter - metallic interfaces .",
    "they demonstrated that coulomb effects result in effective reduction of the josepson current through the system .    in this work",
    "we will argue that electron - electron interactions also provide an alternative mechanism of the supercurrent suppression not directly related to coulomb blockade .",
    "it is _ quantum dephasing of cooper pairs _ which yields exponential reduction of the josephson current in sufficiently long diffusive @xmath0 junctions even in the zero temperature limit .",
    "note that previously various aspects of the effect of electron - electron interactions on dissipative ( andreev ) currents in @xmath2 hybrid structures were studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , interaction - induced quantum dephasing in such structures was addressed both phenomenologically @xcite and microscopically @xcite demonstrating that at sufficiently low temperatures this effect may strongly modify the andreev conductance of @xmath2 systems provided the size of the normal metal becomes comparable with ( or bigger than ) the fundamental scale of dephasing length @xmath1 which is set by interactions and stays finite down to zero temperature .",
    "although the effect of quantum dephasing of cooper pairs by electron - electron interactions @xcite is to a large extent similar to that previously investigated for normal electrons @xcite within the framework of the so - called weak localization problem , there are also important differences between these effects in @xmath2 structures and normal metals .",
    "they are caused , e.g. , by the different spin structure of the propagators describing cooper pairs and single electrons in such systems @xcite as well as by some other features .",
    "hence , it is not possible to directly adapt the results @xcite to superconducting hybrids in which case a separate analysis is required .",
    "this analysis will be developed below for the josephson current flowing across diffusive @xmath0 junctions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our theoretical approach based on the real time ( keldysh ) version of the nonlinear @xmath3-model . in section 3",
    "this approach is employed for the analysis of the dc josephson current in diffusive @xmath0 structures in the presence of electron - electron interactions .",
    "the effect of interaction - induced cooper pair dephasing on the supercurrent is addressed in section 4 .",
