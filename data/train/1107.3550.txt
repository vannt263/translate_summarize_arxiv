    ", it has been shown recently that there are only _ three _ independent cosmological solutions which produce a scale invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations on an attractor background  @xcite , assuming vacuum initial conditions .",
    "see  @xcite@xmath0@xcite for related work .",
    "the most well  known of these solutions is of course inflation  @xcite , which relies on exponential expansion of the background with @xmath5 .",
    "more recently , the adiabatic ekpyrotic  @xcite scenario has been proposed , in which a scale invariant spectrum is produced by a rapidly evolving equation of state @xmath6 on a slowly contracting background . the third solution can be viewed as a variant of adiabatic ekpyrosis , where curvature perturbations are again sourced by a rapidly changing equation of state , but this time on a slowly expanding background  @xcite . at the level of the two - point function , these three scenarios yield indistinguishable power spectra .",
    "however , the degeneracy is broken at the three  point level .",
    "the non  inflationary solutions have strongly scale dependent non ",
    "gaussianities  @xcite , which can be traced to the rapid growth of the equation of state parameter . in these models , @xmath7 grows rapidly at small scales and perturbative control is lost when @xmath8 .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by suitably modifying the potential so that @xmath1 becomes much smaller on small scales .",
    "but this in turn restricts the range of scale invariant and gaussian modes to about 5 decades ( @xmath9 ) or @xmath10 e - folds in @xmath11space @xcite . as a result , with @xmath4 and attractor background ,",
    "inflation is the unique single field mechanism capable of producing many decades of scale invariant and gaussian perturbations .",
    "( of course , as a theory of the early universe inflation must still surmount some foundational issues , such as the measure problem and low - entropy initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "here we leave aside these critical questions and note that inflation , viewed as a mechanism for generating density perturbations , remains weakly  coupled over a large range of modes . )    in this paper we generalize the analysis to the case of time - varying sound speed , @xmath12 , as obtained , for instance , with non - canonical scalar fields . with einstein gravity plus a single degree of freedom ,",
    "the sound speed is the only remaining knob at our disposal . as shown in  @xcite , allowing for @xmath12 greatly broadens the realm of allowed cosmologies that yield a scale invariant power spectrum . in particular , any cosmology with constant equation of state can be made scale invariant by suitably choosing the evolution of the sound speed . in this work",
    "we show that non - gaussianities impose stringent constraints on the allowed cosmologies .",
    "our analysis is very general and applies to _ arbitrary _ time - dependent @xmath13 and @xmath12 , with the only restriction that the null energy condition be satisfied : @xmath14 .",
    "we begin by reviewing how the time  dependence of the sound speed results in an effective cosmological background for the curvature perturbation , as was first shown in  @xcite . in this effective background , which depends both on the evolution of the scale factor and the sound speed , @xmath1 propagates at the speed of light .",
    "we derive a consistency equation that the scale factor and the sound speed must satisfy in order to have scale invariance at the two  point level . in the spirit of @xcite ,",
    "given an evolution for the scale factor , solving this equation gives a suitable evolution for the sound speed for which @xmath1 has a scale invariant two  point function on an attractor background .",
    "this shows that a time  dependent sound speed vastly increases the degeneracy at the two  point level .    as in the canonical case ,",
    "this degeneracy is generically broken by the three  point function .",
    "in particular , if the three  point function is strongly scale  dependent , we generically expect the theory to become strongly coupled either in the infrared ( ir ) or in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . to avoid such perturbative breakdown , we demand that certain contributions to the three  point function be scale invariant .",
    "this turns out to be extremely restrictive : we show that slow ",
    "roll inflation is the _",
    "unique _ cosmology with this property .",
    "conversely , if the three  point function is not scale invariant , then non  gaussianities will increase rapidly with scale , resulting in a finite range ( @xmath15 modes ) of perturbations consistent with observations , as in the canonical case .",
    "this is a remarkable fact ; it is extremely surprising , in light of the vast degeneracy afforded by a variable sound speed , that slow ",
    "roll inflation should be the unique possibility .",
    "there is , navely , a way to avoid our argument ; since all the vertices in the cubic action are proportional to @xmath16 , it may be possible to have a strongly scale dependent three ",
    "point function while remaining weakly  coupled by taking @xmath17 .",
    "there has recently been much interesting work done related to this idea .",
    "a concrete example of this limit is given by the scenario considered in  @xcite@xmath0@xcite , based on earlier ideas in  @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "in these scenarios , the sound speed is assumed @xmath18 in the very early universe and decreases in time .",
    "it should be noted that theories with superluminal propagation can not be uv completed by a theory with an analytic s ",
    "matrix , for example local quantum field theory or perturbative string theory  @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of generality , we remain agnostic about the nature of any uv completion of the theories we consider .",
    "we review the particular superluminal mechanism where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant and show that such cosmologies are also tightly constrained by strong coupling considerations . again in these cases , only a finite range of scale invariant modes can be generated without hitting strong coupling . in order to understand this constraint , recall that the @xmath1 power spectrum is given by p_~o()~10 ^ -10  .",
    "it is immediately clear that at early times , when @xmath17 , there is a tension between keeping @xmath21 and maintaining the observed amplitude for density perturbations . for @xmath22 ,",
    "this keeps us from taking @xmath23 to be too large , which bounds the range of scale invariant modes to about 8 decades ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this tension may be alleviated by taking @xmath19 to be exponentially large , but this causes the amplitude of non  gaussianities to grow . because @xmath23 is decreasing in time , demanding that the theory remain weakly coupled imposes a bound of about 12 decades ( @xmath25 ) on mode production . though this range is significantly larger than the @xmath26 viable modes in the canonical case , we still have to account for the coincidence that these overlap with the observable window .",
    "our results have some overlap with that of baumann _ et al . _",

    "however , our analysis is much more general  in the variable sound speed case , baumann _ et al _ considered only sub ",

    "in contrast , we allow _ arbitrary _ evolution for @xmath19 and @xmath23  including the superluminal regime  in section [ threepoint ] and analyze in detail the constant @xmath19 superluminal scenarios in section [ loophole ] .",
    "we begin by considering how a varying sound speed affects the classification of scale invariance at the two  point level recently undertaken in @xcite .",

    "( note that when @xmath33 , the variable @xmath34 measures the size of the sound horizon . ) additionally , we define qz =  . in terms of these new variables , the quadratic @xmath1 action takes the familiar form s_2=m_pl^2d^3xdy",
    "q^2  , where primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "the virtue of this change of variables is manifest  @xmath1 now propagates luminally , but in _ effective _ cosmological background defined both by the scale factor and the sound speed .",
    "the mode functions of the canonically normalized field , @xmath35 , obey the familiar - looking equation of motion v_k+(k^2-)v_k=0  .",
    "[ mode ] this has exactly the same form as the corresponding equation in the canonical case , but with @xmath36 replacing @xmath37 , a manifestation of the curvature perturbation evolving in an effective geometry .",
    "assuming the usual adiabatic vacuum , it is well known that ( [ mode ] ) will yield a scale invariant spectrum of perturbations provided that =  .",
    "[ qeq ] note that modes freeze out when @xmath38 , which corresponds to sound - horizon crossing in the constant @xmath23 case , hence we take @xmath39 .",
    "the solution for the mode functions is then v_k(y ) = ( 1-)e^iky  , [ vk ] which describes a scale invariant spectrum , @xmath40 , in the limit @xmath41",
    ".    equation ( [ qeq ] ) has two solutions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but only the former describes a background which is a dynamical attractor . to see this , note that in the long wavelength ( @xmath44 ) limit we have the following expression for the power spectrum of the solution ( [ vk ] ) p_= k^3_k^2 ~  , which is indeed independent of @xmath11 . when @xmath45 , @xmath46 outside the horizon , indicating perturbative stability  @xcite .",
    "the other solution @xmath43 , however , implies that @xmath1 grows outside the horizon , @xmath47 , signaling that the background is unstable .",
    "since we are interested in attractor backgrounds , we henceforth ignore the @xmath43 solution .",
    "recalling the definition of @xmath36 , the condition for scale invariance in an attractor background may therefore be succinctly expressed as q^2==  , [ inv ] where @xmath48 is an arbitrary ( positive ) constant .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath49 and @xmath19 are not independent degrees of freedom , but are related by @xmath50 .",
    "changing time variables to @xmath34 , this relation becomes = = ( )   . using the condition  ( [ inv ] ) for scale invariance",
    ", we can rewrite this to obtain the master equation a()=  .",
    "[ diffeq ] this equation ensures a scale invariant spectrum on an attractor background .",
    "as noted in @xcite , in the case where @xmath33 , this equation may be recast as a particular instance of the generalized emden  fowler equation .    for completeness",
    ", we review the results of @xcite . in the case of constant sound speed ( without loss of generality",
    ", we may take @xmath4 ) , there are three distinct scale invariant solutions :    * _ inflation _ is a solution where the scale factor grows as @xmath51 and the equation of state parameter is constant @xmath52 @xcite . to check that this is in fact scale invariant",
    ", we note that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 because @xmath23 is constant . * _ adiabatic ekpyrosis _ is a solution where the equation of state parameter varies rapidly , @xmath55 , while the background remains nearly static , @xmath56 .",
    "again , we can check that this gives a scale invariant spectrum @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , this corresponds to two distinct solutions , one where the background is slowly _ contracting _ @xcite and one where the background is slowly _ expanding _",
    "it is important to note that in these scenarios modes freeze out on sub ",
    "hubble scales and are subsequently pushed outside the horizon during a contracting ekpyrotic phase with constant @xmath58 .",
    "returning to the general case , given any evolution for @xmath49 we can find an evolution of @xmath23 that will make the spectrum of perturbations scale invariant by solving ( [ diffeq ] ) .",
    "alternatively , specifying a relation between the evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath49 is sufficient to determine the evolution . as a result",
    ", we see that there is an enormous amount of degeneracy at the two  point level .",
    "an excellent illustration of this degeneracy is the case of cosmologies with constant @xmath19 . with constant @xmath23 , as reviewed above inflation is the only solution that has constant @xmath19 .",
    "but for more general sound speed , there is a power - law evolution for @xmath23 that yields a scale invariant spectrum for arbitrary positive values of @xmath19 . indeed ,",
    "constancy of @xmath19 and @xmath59 is sufficient to deduce the scaling solutions a~(-y)^  ,  c_s~(-y)^  .",
    "[ acspowerlaw ] inserting these expressions into ( [ diffeq ] ) , we find that the solution is scale invariant for @xmath60 , in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianities offer a powerful tool for differentiating between the different cosmologies with degenerate power spectra .",
    "since the precise form of the cubic action depends the underlying physics , we must choose to parameterize the microphysics in some way .",
    "a convenient and quite general choice is to consider a non ",
    "canonical scalar field @xmath61 , described by a @xmath62 lagrangian s = d^4 x  , [ action ] where @xmath63 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the energy density and sound speed are related to the choice of @xmath64 by  @xcite = 2xp_,x - p ;   c^2_s=  .",
    "the cubic action for @xmath1 is derived in @xcite . making the transformation to the sound horizon time variable @xmath32",

    "although we focus on a particular class of microphysical models , namely @xmath62 theories , the model  dependence of the action is encoded only in @xmath67 .",
    "all other vertices in the cubic action are functions of the scale factor and the sound speed .",
    "for example , for a dbi action , the @xmath68 term in ( [ s3pt ] ) vanishes identically  @xcite .",
    "since the form of this first term will not be material to our arguments , our analysis even at the cubic level is rather general , but there may be some potential model ",
    "dependent effects from the @xmath68 vertex which we have not considered .    to estimate non  gaussianities , a useful approximation is the _ horizon  crossing approximation _ , whereby @xmath69 is estimated by f_nl~._ky=1  .",
    "[ fnl ] here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are terms in the quadratic and cubic lagrangians , respectively . since temporal and spatial gradients are comparable at horizon crossing ( @xmath72 ) , we may trade them freely in  ( [ fnl ] ) .",
    "the horizon - crossing approximation generally offers a good estimate of @xmath69 since modes are in their ground state at early times  when they are far inside the horizon  and become constant outside the horizon .",
    "we therefore expect non - gaussianities to peak around horizon crossing .",
    "contributions peak at late times , well after horizon crossing  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1 goes to a constant outside the horizon , the rapid growth of the vertex , @xmath73 , overwhelms the suppression from @xmath1 derivatives becoming small .",
    "thus , the horizon - crossing approximation is a conservative estimate of non - gaussianities . ]    at a classical level , perturbations are highly non - gaussian for @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75 , and classical perturbation theory breaks down . at a quantum level , the right hand side of  ( [ fnl ] ) also offers an estimate for the magnitude of loop corrections to the two - point function  @xcite .",
    "thus , classical and quantum perturbation theory break down , and the theory becomes strongly coupled , whenever ~1  , or @xmath8 .",
    "this is the same strong coupling criterion used in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath69 is strongly scale dependent , then the growth of non - gaussianities will generically lead to a breakdown of perturbation theory either in the ir or in the uv .",
    "( as mentioned earlier , an exceptional case is the limit @xmath17 , which will be treated separately in section  [ loophole ] . )",
    "this expectation is borne out by the analysis of the canonical case  @xcite . to avoid strong coupling , therefore , we demand that @xmath69 be approximately scale invariant .    amongst the terms in the cubic action",
    "is the vertex s_3",
    "d^3xdy     .",
    "[ s3particular ] evaluating this vertex at horizon  crossing , we find that its non - gaussian contribution is f_nl^^3 ~._k y=1 ~()^2 .",
    "[ fnleps3 ] substituting the condition  ( [ inv ] ) for scale invariance at the two  point level , @xmath76 , this reduces to f_nl^^3 ~_k y=1  .",
    "now , in order for the full three  point function to be scale invariant , a necessary condition is that the contribution from this vertex be scale invariant , barring miraculous cancellations .",
    "this implies that the scale factor must be growing as a ~  , [ yinf ] which corresponds to an effective de sitter geometry .",
    "remarkably , simply demanding scale invariance of the two- and three - point correlation functions , without any consideration of the independent dynamics of @xmath49 and @xmath23 , has led us to focus on backgrounds that are effectively de sitter , albeit in terms of the @xmath34 variable .",
    "thus the question becomes  is it possible to have inflation without inflation ? by this , we mean , is there an evolution where the modes see an effective de sitter space in terms of the @xmath34 variable but for which the true geometry is far from de sitter ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer appears to be no , as we now argue .",
    "with @xmath77 ,  ( [ inv ] ) immediately implies that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is an arbitrary ( positive ) constant .",
    "this is all we need to solve  ( [ diffeq ] ) , with the result c_s(y ) =  ;  ( y ) =  ; [ zero ] where @xmath80 .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath23 start out infinite and decrease rapidly to zero . by construction ,",
    "this solution is scale invariant at the two  point level and the aforementioned three ",
    "point vertex is also scale invariant . at first sight",
    ", we might expect that this solution is far from de sitter because @xmath58 initially .",
    "however , because @xmath19 is decreasing so rapidly , by the time @xmath81 ; @xmath19 is already less than unity , indicating an inflationary spacetime . as such",
    ", this solution is only a small deformation away from the de sitter geometry , specifically only about one e",
    " fold of evolution is non  inflationary .",
    "it is worth noting that while the particular vertex  ( [ s3particular ] ) we have considered yields a time - independent ( and therefore scale invariant ) non - gaussian contribution once  ( [ yinf ] ) is imposed , some of the other vertices vary logarithmically with @xmath34 , such as the @xmath82 vertex .",
    "but this slow growth as a function of scale is of course acceptable from the viewpoint of avoiding large non  gaussianities and the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "the analysis thus far strongly suggests that if we want scale invariance at the level of the three - point function , we are forced to consider an evolution that is very close to de sitter  that is , the cosmological background must inflate .",
    "the intuition for this statement is that every term in the cubic action is multiplied by powers of @xmath19 . in the case of slow - roll inflation ,",
    "we take @xmath83 and therefore get a nearly gaussian spectrum .",
    "note that there is another factor common to every term , namely @xmath16 .",
    "one might therefore suspect that a nearly gaussian spectrum could also result from taking @xmath17 , even with a strongly scale dependent @xmath69 .",
    "this will be treated separately in section  [ loophole ] , where we will show that other considerations should greatly constrain this case as well .",
    "one may wonder whether the assumption of scale invariant three - point function is not too stringent .",
    "a possible loophole would be to have non - gaussianities peak in the ir , where the onset of strong coupling would lie on unobservably large scales .",
    "however it is clear from the above analysis that this would require a scale factor that expands more rapidly than @xmath84 , which is super  inflationary in terms of the @xmath34 variable .",
    "we have studied this case by generalizing the above analysis to power - law dependencies for @xmath69 , and found that inflation ( in terms of cosmic time ) remains the only solution .",
    "given the above arguments , it seems as though it is impossible to have small non - gaussianities over a broad range of modes without invoking a period of inflation .",
    "however , there is an illuminating exceptional case which we now treat separately . as we noted in passing earlier",
    ", every term in the cubic action has a factor of @xmath16 multiplying it . in analogy with slow ",
    "roll inflation , we may imagine controlling the size of the three - point function by making this factor very small , corresponding to superluminal @xmath23 . in principle , this should allow for the production of modes with an extremely gaussian spectrum over a broad range in @xmath11space  @xcite . in practice , however , we will find that only a finite range of scale invariant and gaussian modes can be generated by such mechanisms .",
    "superluminal scenarios have been proposed recently  @xcite@xmath0@xcite , building on previous work on decaying sound speed cosmologies  @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "these models take advantage of having an extremely large speed of sound at early times which suppresses non  gaussianities on large scales . by virtue of the fact that the sound horizon at early times is much larger than the co  moving hubble radius ,",
    "the horizon problem is addressed .",
    "the large sound speed decays as time goes on , causing the co  moving sound horizon to shrink in time .",
    "see fig .",

    ", the range of modes accessible to observations can be highly gaussian by having @xmath17 , which amounts to making the coefficient in  ( [ fnlcsgg1 ] ) very small .",

    "indeed , the power spectrum in the constant @xmath19 case is given by  @xcite p_=_k|y| = 1 = ( ky_1)^  , [ pcsgg1 ] which confirms the statement made earlier that exact scale invariance requires @xmath60 .",

    ", any cosmological background can in principle yield a scale invariant spectrum , provided that the sound speed evolves in a suitable way . to avoid strong coupling we have argued that the three - point function should generically also be nearly scale invariant . by demanding that a particular contribution to @xmath69 be scale invariant , we have found that inflation remains the unique solution .",
    "consequently , non  inflationary solutions have strongly scale  dependent non  gaussianities , and therefore the range of modes consistent with observations is subject to a bound similar to the canonical case .",
    "one exceptional case is the limit of superluminal sound speed , which has attracted considerable attention recently  @xcite@xmath0@xcite . for concreteness ,",
    "we have focused on superluminal scenarios where both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant in time . in this case , non - gaussianities are strongly scale dependent , but strong coupling is navely avoided by making @xmath17 . while this does alleviate the constraints , we have shown that the combined requirements of sub  planckian hubble parameter and controlled non - gaussianities imply a bound of at most @xmath105 modes ( or 28 e - folds ) with nearly scale invariant and gaussian statistics . this bound is weaker than in the canonical case , but is nevertheless quite restrictive . although we have not considered it in detail here , we expect arguments similar to those in section [ loophole ] to bound mode production in more general superluminal scenarios .",
    "we conclude that , under the assumptions of single degree freedom , attractor background and adiabatic vacuum initial conditions , inflation is the only mechanism capable of generating suitable perturbations over a wide range of scales .",
    "alternative mechanisms must inevitably rely either on an instability of the background , non - vacuum initial state , and/or multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "_ note added : _ as this paper was being completed , reference @xcite appeared , which reaches conclusions similar to ours using different arguments .",
    "specifically , the authors find that that in order to produce more than 7 e  folds of scale invariant modes in a monotonically expanding universe without inflation  barring super ",
    "planckian energy densities  a superluminal speed of sound must be invoked . however , this result relies on the assumption of an expanding background , while our arguments do not require this constraint .    _",

    "<S> only inflation remains weakly coupled over a wide range of modes , while the other scenarios can produce at most 12 e - folds of scale invariant and gaussian modes . in this paper , we investigate how allowing the speed of sound of fluctuations to evolve in time affects this classification . while in the presence of a variable sound speed there are many more scenarios which are scale invariant at the level of the two - point function , they generically suffer from strong coupling problems similar to those in the canonical case . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , an exceptional case with superluminal sound speed , which suppresses non - gaussianities and somewhat alleviates strong coupling issues . </S>",
