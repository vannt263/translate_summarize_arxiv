    "this process is potentially sensitive to new physics signals and , as it gives rise to same sign dilepton final states , it is also a background to new physics scenarios . to distinguish potential signatures of physics beyond the standard model from the effect of higher order corrections , precise theoretical predictions are essential .",
    "although the qcd corrections to the integrated cross sections were found to be relatively small , their effect on several distributions is appreciable . when nlo qcd corrections are taken into account , the residual scale uncertainties are at the 2.5% level .",
