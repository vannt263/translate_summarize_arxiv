    "the idea that our 4-dimensional universe might be a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional space - time has attracted much attention over the last several years .",
    "randall and sundrum ( rs ) models@xcite are the most important . according to the brane world scenario ,",
    "the physical fields in our 4-dimensional space - time are confined to the three brane , while gravity can freely propagate in the bulk space - time .",
    "we assume a friedmann metric for 4-dimensional spacetime embedded in the bulk 5- dimensional space with a cosmological constant @xmath0 .    the friedmann equation on the rsii brane is,@xcite    @xmath1    with    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant on the brane , @xmath4 is the brane tension , @xmath5 is energy density of ordinary cosmological matter on the brane , k is the curvature index , and the term with c ( a constant ) is the dark radiation term.@xcite cosmology constrains the amount of dark radiation to be at most 10 percent of the energy density in photons.@xcite in the following we will assume ads bulk spacetime , and @xmath6 ,   and @xmath7    in rsii model the important change in friedmann s equation compared to the usual four dimensional form is the appearance of a term proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "it tells us that if the matter energy density is much larger than the brane tension , i.e. @xmath9 , the expansion rate h is proportional @xmath8 . only in the limit where the brane tension is much larger than the matter energy density",

    "this equation is used to describe an adiabatic evolution of a closed system with a comoving volume @xmath13 .",

    "the heat received by the system is due to the change of the number of particles . in our cosmological context",

    "it has been shown based on the supernova data that matter creation alone does not drive cosmic acceleration.@xcite our motivation is the following : the modified friedmann equation on rsii brane world shows that there is transition for the universe evolution between an early high energy regime characterized by the behavior @xmath43 and a late low energy regime characterized by the standard evolution @xmath44 .@xcite the matter creation process due to its negative pressure can be the cause of this transition .",
