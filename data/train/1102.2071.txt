    "a large ion collider experiment ( alice )  @xcite is a general - purpose heavy - ion experiment which has been designed to study the physics of the strongly interacting matter in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the alice experiment is the only experiment at the lhc devoted to heavy - ion physics to study the nature of the quark matter under the conditions of extreme temperature ( @xmath3 0.3 gev ) and high energy density ( @xmath4 10 gev/@xmath5 ) .    the complicated structure of nuclear matter at low temperatures , where it is composed of a multitude of hadronic particles , baryons and mesons , is expected to give way at high temperatures to a plasma of weakly interacting quarks and gluons , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a thermalized system where the properties of the system are governed by the quark and gluon degrees of freedom is called the qgp  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks ( charm and beauty ) are produced in the first stages of the relativistic collisions and then they coexist with the surrounding medium due to their long life - time  @xcite .",
    "transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) and rapidity ( @xmath7 ) distributions and quarkonia  @xcite production rates are the significant probes which will allow for probing the properties of the medium",
    ".    the lhc will allow us to probe the parton distribution functions of the nucleon and in the case of pa and aa collisions , also their modifications in the nucleus , at very low values of momentum fraction ( bjorken @xmath8 ) .",
    "due to its lower mass , charm allows us to probe in lower @xmath8 than beauty .",
    "the capabilities to measure charm and beauty particles in the forward rapidity region ( @xmath9 ) using the muon spectrometer  @xcite gives access to the regime of @xmath10 .",
    "the alice muon spectrometer physics program is focussed on the measurement of heavy - flavor production in pp , pa and aa collisions at lhc energies .",
    "heavy - quark production measurements in pp collisions at lhc energies provide the necessary baseline for the study of medium effects in aa collisions along with the test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in an unexplored energy regime much higher than the rhic energies  @xcite . the strong interaction with the high density",
    "qcd matter results in an energy - loss  @xcite whose effects were already seen in rhic results  @xcite , but further analyses are required to understand the details of underlying mechanism .",
    "also the production mechanisms of the various theoretical models  @xcite needs to be tested and the relevant observables ( from the experience in @xmath11 collisions at tevatron energies  @xcite ) are quarkonia cross - sections and @xmath6 distributions .    the data taking in the alice experiment started from 2009 with pp collisions at the lhc at @xmath2 = 900 gev and from march 2010 at @xmath2 = 7 tev .",
    "data for pb - pb collisions at @xmath12 = 2.76 tev were successfully taken from november 7 to december 6 , 2010 .",
    "in the framework of the alice physics program  @xcite , the goal of the muon spectrometer of alice is the study of quarkonia production , open heavy flavor production and vector meson properties via the muonic decay channel . for heavy - ion collisions the dependence with the collision centrality and with the reaction plane",
    "will also be studied .",
    "the spectrometer acceptance covers the forward ( lhc - clockwise stream with respect to the interaction point ) pseudo - rapidity domain of -4.0 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 -2.5 ( small angles between @xmath13 and @xmath14 relative to the beam direction ) .",
    "the resonances can be detected down to zero transverse momentum .",
    "the muon spectrometer is comprised of absorbers to filter the background , a 10 plane tracking chamber system before , inside and after the magnet , a muon filter ( iron wall ) and a set of trigger chambers .",
    "1 shows the layout of the alice muon spectrometer . outside the l3 magnet",
    "there is a large warm dipole magnet with a 3 t@xmath15 m field integral .",
    "absorbers reduce the initial flux of primary hadrons from nucleus - nucleus collisions by a factor of 100 , and they reduce the low energy particles flow produced in secondary interactions ( mainly low energy electrons ) . the thick front absorber ( @xmath16 ) is the most critical component and it has been designed for minimizing the invariant mass resolution deterioration of the spectrometer due to straggling and multi - scattering . the spectrometer is also shielded throughout its length by a dense absorber tube surrounding the beam pipe . a second absorber and four planes of resistive plate detectors are used for muon identification and triggering .",
    "the front absorber and the muon filter wall stop muons upto 4 gev / c .",
    "this makes the detection of muons with a momentum smaller than 4 gev / c impossible .",
    "a total of ten tracking chambers grouped in five stations define the muon trajectories .",
    "the tracking stations are multi - wire proportional chambers with segmented cathode plane ( cathode pad chambers , cpc ) .",
    "each station is made of two chamber planes and each chamber has two cpcs which are both read via front - end electronics , in order to have a two - dimensional hit information .",
    "the detection planes are quadrant structure for stations 1 and 2 and slat structure for stations 3 to 5 .",
    "cpcs have been chosen because they can be equipped with high granularity read - out and reach the required resolution .",
    "the tracking chambers  @xcite must satisfy two main requirements : to have a spatial resolution of about 100 @xmath17 m needed for bending ( @xmath18 ) plane of the muon trajectory to achieve the required mass resolution and to have the capability to operate , with a good efficiency , in high particle multiplicity environment .",
    "two tracking stations are located in front of the dipole magnet , another one is located inside , and two more stations sit behind the magnet .    the front - end electronics  @xcite is based for all the tracking stations on a 64 channels board ( manu ) including four charge amplifier chips ( manas ) , adcs and a readout chip allowing zero suppression ( marc ) .",
    "about 17,000 manu boards are necessary to read the million channels .",
    "the data are transferred from the manu to the concentrator readout cluster unit system ( crocus ) .",
    "twenty crocus are needed for the five stations .",
    "the main tasks of the crocus are to concentrate the data from a half detection plane and send it to the data acquisition ( daq ) , to perform the calibration of the manu and to dispatch the trigger signal from the central trigger processor .",
    "the trigger system of the muon spectrometer consists in four planes of resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) detectors operated in streamer mode .",
    "a total of 21,000 resistive plate chamber front - end channels and fast - decision electronics , covering an area of 140 m@xmath19 are arranged in two stations one metre apart from each other and placed behind the muon filter .",
    "it is designed to identify the ( muon ) tracks , in a large background environment , to provide a fast trigger signal .",
    "most of the muons emitted in the decays of the quarkonia resonances have a transverse momentum @xmath6 larger than that of the background muons from pion and kaon decays .",
    "a cut on the transverse momentum of the muons is done by the trigger to reject the background and to select the interesting events , containing at least a pair of opposite - sign muons with a high @xmath6 .",
    "from the front - end electronics the signals are send to the trigger electronics , based on programmable circuits , working at 40 mhz . according to simulations ,",
    "the total dimuon trigger rate is expected not to exceed 1 khz for all colliding systems .",
    "such a rate complies with daq and hlt ( high level trigger ) requirements .",
    "all the detectors were installed and commissioning started at the beginning of 2007 in the cavern with the testing of all the functionalities : hv , lv , cooling , gas , electronic noise , pedestals and stability in time .",
    "next , the detectors ready for the first alice cosmic runs were integrated in the global daq with a trigger given by scintillators placed horizontally on the top of the l3 magnet . the first cosmic tracks in the muon spectrometer",
    "were observed in the tracking stations 1 and 2 and the trigger rpcs during february 2008 when the muon trigger was added to the general alice trigger . during 2010 , alice collected data in pp collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev , where all the five stations of the muon spectrometer participated with a tracking efficiency of @xmath20 94@xmath21 . achieving a stable configuration with daq and triggers , the muon spectrometer recorded their crucial magnetic - field off run in may 2010 , for the alignment of the detector - elements .",
    "this has further enhanced the quarkonia measurements by a large scale which is now close to what is expected from simulations .",
    "the data sample for the muon spectrometer comprises of minimum bias ( mb ) events and events with at least one triggered muon . the main trigger selection was a mb one which is defined by the inclusion of at least a signal in either of the two scintillator hodoscopes , the v0 detectors , positioned in the forward and backward regions of the alice experiment , or in the pixel barrel detector .",
    "this trigger selects events with at least one charged particle in eight units of pseudorapidity and is sensitive to about 95@xmath21 of the pp inelastic cross section  @xcite . a second trigger selection ( @xmath17-mb )",
    "requests , in addition to the minimum - bias condition , at least one particle which has been detected in the muon spectrometer , having a @xmath6 larger than the trigger threshold ( 0.5 gev / c ) .",
    "the results that we present are obtained from data recorded during the initial 2 - 3 months of pp collisions at @xmath2=7 tev with an average luminosity kept at ( 0.6 - 1.2)@xmath22 in order to control the collision pile - up rate in the alice experiment .",

    "this is based on a realistic description of the detectors response .",
    "accounting for the small uncertainties in the mc description of the set - up , the position of the j/@xmath24 mass pole along with the width of the crystal ball function are kept as free parameters in the invariant mass fit . due to the small statistics , the @xmath24(2s ) parameters",
