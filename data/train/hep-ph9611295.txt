    "the various channels of the bremsstrahlung conversion , including the production of the @xmath20 pairs , pions and dileptons are considered with emphasize to their observable signals .",

    ". from   one can calculate the energy flux of the vector field at a large distance from the collision region  @xcite .",

    "the spectral function describing the deviation from the on  mass  shell may be written as ( m)=. to calculate the distribution of virtual mesons in their 4momentum @xmath31 we use the formulae  @xcite = ( m ) s(p ) , where @xmath32 . in the limit",

    "it is interesting that the bremsstrahlung component of pion yield becomes comparable with pion production in incoherent hadron ",

    "4 shows the distributions over invariant masses of particles produced in different channels of bremsstrahlung conversion in the case of a central au+au collision at the sps energy .",
    "note that the mass spectrum of e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs created by the bremsstrahlung mechanism has a strong peak at invariant masses below the @xmath0 meson mass . on the other hand ,",
    "attempts to explain the low mass dilepton yield by the conventional incoherent mechanisms ( e.g. due to the @xmath85 processes ) strongly underestimate the observable data  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have shown that the coherent bremsstrahlung of the vector meson field may be an important source of particle production already at the sps bombarding energies .",
    "the observable signals of this mechanism may be the two  hump structure of pion and antibaryon rapidity spectra as well as the enhanced yield of low mass dileptons .",
    "the sharp energy and a  dependence of pion , dilepton and antibaryon excitation functions can be also a signature of the considered mechanism .",
