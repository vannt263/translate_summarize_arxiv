    "the problem of determining the effective conductivity of a classical inhomogeneous medium  @xcite is an old one , but a comprehensive theory of the magnetotransport in such systems is still far from complete .",
    "moreover , much of the early work on inhomogeneous conductors concentrates on the zero - magnetic - field case since this is analogous to calculating the polarization of a random dielectric @xcite . for the classical problem to be appropriate , the mean free path of the charge carriers must be much less than the typical length scale of the disorder so that ohm s law is obeyed locally in space : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the current density , @xmath2 is the electric field and @xmath3 is the resistivity tensor . in the case of a simple conductor that possesses a single charge carrier and isotropic inhomogeneities , the resistivity tensor acquires the following form in a magnetic field @xmath4 : @xmath5 it is clear that this tensor is characterised by just two parameters : the carrier mobility @xmath6 ( since the dimensionless variable @xmath7 ) and the scalar resistivity @xmath8 . while more complex , anisotropic resistivity tensors have also been considered in the inhomogeneous conductor problem  @xcite , this paper shall be solely concerned with eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .    for inhomogeneous conductors ,",
    "the effective resistivity @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 specifies an average over volume . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the magnetoresistance @xmath12/\\rho_{\\mathrm{eff}}(0)$ ] is trivially zero , for arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "however , in general , the magnetoresistance strongly depends on whether it is transverse or longitudinal , i.e.  whether the magnetic field is perpendicular or parallel to the current .",
    "furthermore , any nonzero transverse magnetoresistance must be an even function of field due to the rotational symmetry about the current axis .",
    "thus , @xmath13 in the low field limit , which is usually defined to be @xmath14 , but the crossover from the low - field to high - field regime is not always obvious in disordered systems , as will be discussed later .",
    "some recent experiments  @xcite on the doped silver chalcogenides , ag@xmath15se and ag@xmath15te , have added impetus to the investigation of this problem .",
    "both silver chalcogenides exhibit a positive , transverse magnetoresistance that is a linear function of magnetic field throughout the temperature range @xmath16k to @xmath17k , with no signs of saturation up to fields of 60t@xcite .",
    "in particular , the linearity continues down deep into the low - field regime @xmath14 .",
    "such behaviour is not what is seen in conventional semiconductors , where the resistance increases quadratically with increasing magnetic field at low fields and , except in very special circumstances , eventually saturates at fields typically of order 1 t @xcite , corresponding to @xmath18 . since the silver chalcogenides are non - magnetic compounds , the origin of the large magnetoresistance is unclear , although a quantum theory based on the partial population of one landau magnetic band has been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , the large range in temperature over which the phenomenon occurs suggests that one should examine large magnetoresistances resulting from classical effects , namely the case where the semiconductor is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "the theoretical study of classically disordered conductors may be divided into two separate classes : media consisting of two or more distinct phases , separated by sharp boundaries , and systems that possess continuously variable fluctuations in the conductivity . in the first class ,",
    "solutions for a non - zero magnetic field have been derived for an isotropic medium with a low volume fraction @xmath19 of insulating spherical inclusions @xcite , and they give a positive linear magnetoresistance in the high field limit @xmath20 , but the increase of the magnetoresistance @xmath21 with field is small , being proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "an effective medium method has been used to extend this solution to higher volume fractions @xcite , but this result is approximate and it is still only applicable to high fields @xmath23 .",
    "the class of systems with continuously varying conductivity fluctuations has only been studied for weak , short - range disorder @xcite .",
    "using an advection - diffusion analogy , the effective magnetoresistance is determined to be @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where the disorder width @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the main limitation of the current literature is that it is generally restricted to media that only deviate slightly from homogeneity , so the increase in magnetoresistance is small and anomalous behaviour only occurs at very high magnetic fields . whilst there is an exact solution for the effective magnetoresistance in two dimensions that yields a linear magnetoresistance , it is restricted to the special case of a two - component media with equal proportions of each phase @xcite .",
    "however , this does lend credence to the hypothesis that classical disorder is the cause of the anomalous magnetoresistance of the silver chalcogenides .    in order to attack the problem of strong inhomogeneities",
    ", we previously introduced a two - dimensional random resistor network model @xcite .",
    "we used it to show that classical disorder is a possible cause of the anomalous magnetoresistance of the silver chalcogenides , and we raised the possibility of using the networks to construct magnetic field sensors that operate on principles similar to extraordinary magnetoresistance ( emr ) devices @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the galvanomagnetic properties of the random resistor network model in detail .",
    "this model allows one to study the magnetoresistance of an inhomogeneous semiconductor across the whole magnetic field range for a variety of disorder . by considering voltages and current paths within the network , as well as network magnetoresistances ,",
    "we demonstrate that our resistor network is also capable of simulating macroscopic media with complicated boundaries .",
    "we use this result to include contact effects between resistors within the network .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section  [ model ] describes the random resistor network model and derives expressions for the network magnetoresistance and hall resistance . in sec .  [ small ] , we use the insight gained from studying the characteristics of small networks to ascertain the symmetries of the network magnetoresistance and , thus , determine the condition for which the magnetoresistance is non - saturating .",

    "we tackle the inhomogeneous conductor problem by discretizing the medium into a random resistor network and analysing it numerically .",
    "standard resistor networks , where the network unit is taken to be a two - terminal homogeneous resistor , are inadequate for simulating current flow in a magnetic field , since it does not allow the current to flow perpendicular to the voltage drop across a resistor .",

    "this is sufficient for simulating a transverse magnetoresistance , but not a longitudinal one since this requires a three - dimensional network .",
    "networks with multi - terminal elements have also been used to study percolating media in a magnetic field @xcite but , unlike our model , the elements were restricted to being either insulators or conductors of a set conductivity .    in principle",

    "in addition , the anomalous hall coefficient in fig .  [ hall ] qualitatively matches calculations for the response of simple hall devices constructed from homogeneous materials with a square geometry  @xcite like that in fig .",
    "[ beffect ] . there , a geometrical correction factor is used to describe the diminution of the hall voltage due to finite size effects , and this factor is dependent on the ratio of the electrode width @xmath195 with respect to the length @xmath196 of the hall device , i.e.  the ratio @xmath69 of an infinite uniform resistor network .",
    "it is important to stress that _ random _ resistor networks correspond to an entirely different class of system from the homogeneous conductor : the infinite random resistor network represents an inhomogeneous material , while a uniform network may only be regarded as inhomogeneous when the system size is finite . comparing figs .  [ urvisual](a ) and ( b ) , we see that the current paths are highly inhomogeneous and filamentary within the random network unlike the uniform case .",
    "the voltage landscape is also nontrivial and the current paths create loops within the random system .",
    "therefore , the magnetoresistance should be non - zero deep within the random network , away from the boundaries .",
    "we can strengthen this claim by considering the voltage correlation function : @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the voltage at position @xmath199 in the network , @xmath200 denotes vectors oriented in the @xmath187-direction , and @xmath201 represents an average over @xmath199 . taking the radii of the disks to be 1 ( arbitrary units ) , we should note that @xmath202 in an @xmath130 network , since this corresponds to measuring the potential difference across the whole network .",
    "networks of varying disorder .",
    "note that the cases with @xmath203 correspond to @xmath204 , since @xmath205 .",
    "for random networks , the function has been averaged over 100 samples.,width=264 ]    figure  [ vxcorr ] plots the voltage correlation function at large magnetic field of @xmath164 networks for four different cases of disorder . when the network is uniform",
    ", we see that the slope of @xmath206 suddenly increases for large @xmath200 , which implies that the voltage drops within the network are smaller than those close to the boundary .",
    "this demonstrates that much of the magnetoresistance of the network is confined to the boundaries , as expected .",
    "in contrast , as we increase the disorder in the network , the behaviour of @xmath206 tends to a straight line , indicating that the linear magnetoresistance is spread across the whole of the network and is not just a boundary effect .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that maximum insensitivity to the boundary is achieved when @xmath207 , which could imply that the magnetoresistance is largest when electrons and holes are present in equal proportions , as has been measured in experiment  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations by guttal and stroud  @xcite on two - dimensional , two - phase media further support these observations .",
    "they prove that the magnetoresistance of their inhomogeneous conductor is linear when @xmath208 , but it can saturate when @xmath209 , like in experiment .",
    "in addition to studies of random media , there is also interest in understanding classical macroscopic media with complex geometries , because of possible geometrical effects in magnetoresistance and hall measurements .",
    "geometric enhancements of the magnetoresistance are already the basis of sensitive emr magnetic - field sensors  @xcite . in general",
    ", it is difficult to analytically calculate the magnetotransport of macroscopic media with complicated boundaries , because the calculation involves solving differential equations for the currents / voltages where the boundary conditions contain derivatives that are oblique to the boundary surfaces  @xcite .",
    "thus , standard mathematical techniques , such as separation of variables , will typically fail in these problems , although the application of conformal mappings in two dimensions has proved successful in dealing with simple geometries  @xcite .",
    "however , one can , in principle , use infinite uniform networks to simulate two - dimensional , macroscopic , composite conductors , in a manner analogous to the finite - element modelling of emr devices  @xcite .",
    "moreover , current perturbations at the connections between disks can be disregarded entirely in these networks if we choose the terminals to have the same resistivity as the disks .",
    "boundaries within the macroscopic system still present a potential problem since they involve disks of differing resistivity connected together .",
    "but , at fixed magnetic field , the magnitude of these contact effects will tend to zero as the granularity of the network goes to zero ( @xmath210 ) , provided the number of elements with contact effects scales slower than the total number of elements .",
    "this is certainly true for one - dimensional boundaries within a two - dimensional homogeneous medium , since the number of boundary elements in the network scales like @xmath84 while the total number of elements scales like @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to note that the homogeneous conductor constructed from the infinite uniform network will possess a mobility @xmath211 and resistivity @xmath212 that is different from those of the elements that generate the network .",
    "generally , these effective network parameters will depend on the geometry of the element as well as the connections between elements .",
    "for the situation where there is no resistance between the elements , the effective quantities can be determined from the resistivity and hall coefficient of a single element .",
    "therefore , using eq .",

    "[ beffect ] has resistance : @xmath216 where @xmath217",

    "[ mr_nm ] demonstrate that the resistance is approximately given by the expression : @xmath227 thus , in the limit where @xmath210 , we have resistance @xmath228 this becomes independent of network dimensions as @xmath229 , like previous studies of two - terminal devices have predicted  @xcite , but the high - field magnetoresistance is @xmath230 since @xmath231 .",
    "the insights gained in the previous section can be used to analyse contact effects between elements in the network .",
    "we previously assumed a uniform current injection into the disk terminals , but this is generally difficult to achieve when @xmath20 .",
    "the assumption of uniform current is only valid for all fields when the hall resistance @xmath232 and thickness @xmath37 is identical for each element . to assess the ramifications of current perturbations at the disk terminals , we consider the simple case of ideal metal bridges connecting the disks .",
    "our numerical simulations show that current distortions are restricted to the vicinity of the perfectly conducting electrode , while other calculations  @xcite demonstrate that the lengthscale of the current distortion is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath233 , it is legitimate to replace the bridge with a two - terminal resistor possessing a field - dependent resistance . using our results for a homogeneous conductor with boundaries",
    ", we determine the contact resistance between disks @xmath234 and @xmath144 to be @xmath235 where we take @xmath236 to obtain the correct low - field and high - field limits .",
    "the contact resistance can not be eliminated from our network model by reducing the terminal width @xmath33 , because the disk impedance coefficients associated with field in eq .",
    "( [ z_disk ] ) are independent of @xmath33 like @xmath237 , even though the disk resistance tends to infinity as @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , in the case of the infinite uniform network at large fields , the contact resistance @xmath238 is equal to the network resistance @xmath239 without metallic bridges for _ all _ @xmath233 . from simulations of random square networks that include this contact resistance , we find that the size of the network magnetoresistance is increased by up to 100% or more , depending on the network disorder , but the major results are qualitatively unchanged : the variation in magnetoresistance decreases with increasing network size like in fig .",
    "[ scale ] , the average magnetoresistance is linearly dependent on field , and the crossover point is determined by the mobility distribution , as in fig .  [ rand ] .",
    "one important consequence of these contact resistances is that the bulk magnetoresistance is always non - saturating and linear , plus the network s sensitivity to the network boundaries is reduced . for example , an infinite uniform square network with metal bridges will possess a non - zero bulk magnetoresistance of @xmath240 due to the contacts , and we find that this accounts for about 70% of a two - terminal measurement of the network s magnetoresistance .",
    "note that contacts of perfectly - conducting wires represent an extreme limit where the contact effects are greatest .",
    "a potentially richer case is where the wires are replaced by interfaces between elements . here , the magnitude of each contact resistance in a random network ranges from eq .",
    "( [ conmr ] ) right down to zero , when neighbouring elements have the same hall resistance and thickness .",
    "thus , we can expect to recover bulk magnetoresistances , similar to those displayed in fig .",
    "[ vxcorr ] , that sensitively depend on network disorder .",
    "the situation is further complicated when we consider three - dimensional effects at the connections between resistors .",
    "an interesting example is where the disk resistivity @xmath36 and mobility @xmath6 are constant within the network , but @xmath57 is varied by altering the disk thickness @xmath37 .",
    "calculations by bruls et al .",
    "@xcite that involve mapping sample thickness variations onto a two - dimensional problem , have shown that sharp changes in thicknesses , like those at the interfaces between resistors , will have resistance @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "thus , the contact resistance still has a linear field dependence at large fields , but the size of the effect is reduced so that the assumption of uniform current injection is now valid for @xmath245",
    ". a thorough analysis of these more complex contact effects will be the subject of future work .",
    "in this paper we have modelled an inhomogeneous conductor using a two - dimensional random resistor network that consists of _ four_-terminal resistors in order to take account of the hall component .",
    "we have shown that the network impedance matrix @xmath58 becomes an odd , antisymmetric matrix at large magnetic field , so that the high - field behaviour of the magnetoresistance is determined by the zero eigenvalue of @xmath58 .",
    "we find that a non - saturating magnetoresistance can be obtained in networks as small as @xmath78 , where a plurality of current paths is allowed within the network , while large networks typically possess a linear magnetoresistance .",
    "this is in contrast to emr devices that exhibit an extremely large but saturating magnetoresistance  @xcite .    by considering large square networks ,",
    "we have demonstrated that uniform networks in the limit of infinite size are equivalent to homogeneous conductors and the observed linear magnetoresistance in this system results from boundary effects at the macroscopic electrodes . as such ,",
    "they can be used to model macroscopic media with complex boundaries . however ,",
    "large random networks model strongly inhomogeneous semiconductors and their magnetoresistance is not simply a boundary effect .",
    "they correctly reproduce the anomalous magnetoresistance of the silver chalcogenides : non - saturating behaviour with a linearity that continues down to low fields for large mobility disorder .",
    "moreover , the magnetoresistance may be large when the hall resistance is zero , like in experiment .",
    "the advantage of such a phenomenological model of positive , non - saturating magnetoresistance is that it is potentially relevant to a whole range of materials .",
    "already , similar magnetoresistances have been observed in metallic vo@xmath246 thin films  @xcite , micro - sized co@xmath247-c@xmath248 composites  @xcite and lasb@xmath249 crystals  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional electron gases also show a mysterious linear magnetoresistance  @xcite and classical disorder has been cited as a possible cause  @xcite .",
    "a major limitation of our random resistor network model is that it is restricted to two dimensions and , thus , can not describe longitudinal magnetoresistance .",
    "it is also known that weakly disordered systems with continuous fluctuations in the conductivity possess magnetoresistances that depend on the dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we must extend our resistor network model to three dimensions in order to fully simulate an inhomogeneous semiconductor .",
    "however , we anticipate that our two - dimensional resistor networks will motivate experiments on the magnetotransport of systems with controlled disorder and on high - field magnetic sensors",
    ".    finally , it would be interesting to explore the magnetothermopower of our resistor networks .",
    "a giant magnetothermopower is associated with ag@xmath250te samples  @xcite and its origin may also lie in classical disorder , because experiments on composite semiconductor - metal structures demonstrate that the magnetothermopower can be geometrically enhanced  @xcite .",
