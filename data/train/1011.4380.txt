    "the magnetic field in the quiet sun internetwork has been subject to an intense debate over the years .",

    "the magnetic field vector was retrieved from the stokes vector using the vfisv ( very fast inversion of the stokes vector ; borrero et al .",
    "2010 ) inversion code .",
    "we employ a parametrized atmospheric model that contains a magnetic and a non - magnetic atmosphere next to each other .",
    "the magnetic atmosphere is characterized by the following parameters : magnetic field strength @xmath19 , inclination of the magnetic field with respect to the observer @xmath20 , azimuthal angle of the magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the observer @xmath21 , line - of - sight velocity @xmath22 , damping parameter @xmath23 , ratio of the absorption coefficient between the line - core and the line - continuum @xmath24 , doppler - width @xmath25 , source function at the observer s location @xmath26 , and the gradient of the source function with optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "the non - magnetic atmosphere has one single parameter : fractional area of the pixel filled with non - magnetic plasma ( aka non - magnetic _ nm _ filling factor ) @xmath28 . using initial values for these parameters",
    ", vfisv obtains the theoretical stokes vector @xmath29 as :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the polarized contribution of the magnetized atmosphere , which is obtained by solving the radiative transfer equation under the assumptions of the milne - eddington ( m - e ) approximation .",
    "@xmath32 corresponds to the non - magnetic contribution , which is thus unpolarized ( @xmath33 : see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the total theoretical stokes vector @xmath34 is then compared with the observed one using a merit function @xmath35 , and by means of a non - linear least - squares - fitting algorithm ( levenberg - marquardt method ; press et al .",
    "1986 ) we iterate our initial 10 free parameters until a minimum in @xmath35 is reached . as an example , figures 1 and 2 show the resulting magnetic field strength ( from the inversion ) for maps a and b.      in order to compare with os07b , we have adopted for our inversions a treatment of the non - magnetic atmosphere that similar to theirs : a different @xmath36 profile is used in the inversion of each pixel in the map and therefore only the first component of the stokes vector @xmath36 ( total intensity ) remains . ] .",
    "@xmath36 is obtained for each pixel by averaging only the intensity profiles @xmath9 ( polarization not included ) from the neighboring pixels in a 1 \" square around the inverted one .",
    "this method attempts to mimic a narrow spectrograph s point spread function .",
    "os07b interprets the need for a non - magnetic component as the reduction in the amplitude of the polarization signals ( reduction @xmath37 $ ] ) cause by diffraction .",
    "danilovic et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ascribes it as being caused by a small defocus in the sp instrument .",
    "another feature of our inversions is that we do not consider the free parameter @xmath28 ( eq .  1 ) , but rather we use a different variable @xmath38 , where :    @xmath39    since @xmath28 varies from 0 ( pixel fully filled with the magnetic atmosphere ) to 1 ( pixel fully filled with non - magnetized plasma ) , @xmath40 varies ( through eq .",
    "2 ) between @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for employing @xmath38 instead of @xmath28 is to prevent the inversion from reaching a local minimum in the @xmath35-hypersurface where @xmath28 is either 0 or 1 , resulting in an unrealistic number of pixels harboring these two values .",
    "the use of @xmath38 is supported by the fact that @xmath35 improves on average by about 10 % when using it instead of @xmath28 ( see 5th and 6th columns in table 1 ) .    due to our treatment of the non - magnetic atmosphere some caution",
    "should be exercised when speaking about field strengths in this work . in our modeling of the stokes parameters ( eq .",
    "1 ) we assume that the light we observe at each pixel has a polarized contribution from the pixel itself , plus a non - polarized contribution from the surrounding pixels . from this point of view",
    "we can not talk about intrinsic field strengths but rather about mean field strength inside the resolution element .",
    "an alternative interpretation of eq .",
    "1 assumes that inside the resolution element there are two kinds of atmospheres : a magnetized one and an non - magnetized one , where the magnetized one possesses only _",
    "one _ magnetic field . from this point of view",
    "it is possible to refer to @xmath19 as the intrinsic field strength .",
    "however , hinode / sp s resolution is not sufficient to fully resolve all magnetic structures in the quiet sun",
    ". therefore our treatment oversimplifies the problem , as we are assuming that the magnetic field is constant inside the magnetized atmosphere . in this respect , @xmath19 should be interpreted as the mean field strength in the magnetized atmosphere .",
    "this implies that both interpretations of eq .  1",
    ", despite being different from a physical point of view , are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "because of this , in the following we will refer to the magnetic field as @xmath42 , in order to indicate its averaged nature .",
    "it is important to mention that the results presented in this paper , in particular those in section 5 , do not depend on the scheme employed to characterize the stray - light . as a matter of fact",
    ", the same results are obtained if we consder a global that is common for all inverted pixels , and that is obtained as an average of all pixels , in the fov , where the polarization signals are below the noise level ] stray - light profile , or even if it is completely neglected .",
    "one limitation of the vfisv inversion code is that it only allows to analyze the data from one spectral line at a time .",
    "hinode / sp records the full stokes vector for the line pair at 6301.5  and 6302.5  across 112 spectral positions . from these two lines the obvious choice , due to its larger sensitivity to magnetic fields ( larger land factor ; see sect .",
    "2 ) , is 6302.5 .",
    "therefore vfisv only makes use of 50 spectral points around the second spectral line .",
    "this results in an obvious loss of information , that will yield slightly larger errors in the determination of our model parameters ( sect .  3 ; see also orozco surez et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in order to make sure that this shortcoming is not critical for our study we have repeated the inversions of map a , using the helix++ inversion code ( lagg et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 ) , which allows to consider both spectral lines simultaneously .",
    "the resulting histograms for velocity @xmath22 , magnetic field strength @xmath42 , inclination @xmath20 , etcetera , are very similar to those obtained from the 1-line inversions using vfisv ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this makes us confident that our results are not affected by the fact that only one spectral line is being employed , or at least not to the point of invalidating our results .",
    "we will return to this point in section 5 .",
    "in figures 3a , 4a and 5a we present histograms for the number of pixels whose unsigned polarization signals ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) have peak values @xmath45 times larger than or equal to the noise level in each map .",
    "this is will be referred to as snr : signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the vertical lines in these figures indicate the different snr - thresholds that we have considered in our analysis : 3 , 4.5 and 6 .",
    "for instance , the vertical dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "3a corresponds to snr @xmath46 .",
    "this means that all pixels in map a , where _ at least one _ of the polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath10 ) possesses a snr @xmath47 , are included in the histograms of the remaining panels and represented also by the dashed - dotted line .",
    "likewise for snr @xmath48 ( solid lines ) and snr @xmath49 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the rest of the panels in figs .",
    "3 - 5 show the normalized histograms for the magnetic field strength @xmath42 ( * b*-panels ) , magnetic field inclination with respect to the observer @xmath20 ( * c*-panels ) , and the magnetic filling factor @xmath50 ( * d*-panels ) , which is interpreted as the fractional area of the pixel filled with magnetized plasma .",
    "the normalization is done to ensure that the total area under each histogram equals to 1 . in all these histograms",
    "we have avoided network regions by leaving out of the analysis those pixels where the mean field strength in the resolution element is larger than 750 gauss .",
    "note that in all * a*-panels in figs .  3 - 5 the histograms for the circular and linear polarization peak at snr @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to photon noise .",
    "the probability that photon noise produces a signal , at a given wavelength position , that it is above 3@xmath52 is only 0.3 % .",
    "however , we must take into account that we are taking the peak value for all 112 ( in circular polarization or stokes @xmath10 ) or 224 ( in linear polarization or stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; see sect .",
    "3.2 ) , and therefore it is almost guaranteed that at every observed spatial pixel , photon noise will yield a polarization signal that is larger or equal than 3@xmath52 .",
    "since all considered maps are close to disk center , we can interpret the retrieved inclination with respect to the observer , @xmath20 , as the inclination with respect to the normal direction to the solar surface .",
    "a value of @xmath53 indicates a vertical ( pointing upwards or downwards , respectively ) magnetic field , whereas a value of @xmath4 indicates a magnetic field that is contained in the solar surface .",
    "the resulting histograms are rather similar in all three ( a , b and c ) maps . for all snr - thresholds",
    "considered , the distributions of the average magnetic field strength @xmath42 , magnetic field inclination @xmath20 , and magnetic filling factor @xmath54 , peak at around 50 - 100 gauss , 80 - 100 degrees and 20 - 30 % , respectively .",
    "these results involve the existence of rather weak and horizontal fields in the internetwork , occupying about 20% of the resolution element at every pixel .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the results presented in os07a and os07b . in particular , our retrieved histograms for map a ( fig .",
    "3 ) using a snr - threshold of 4.5 are very similar to those in figs .  3 and 4 in os07a and fig .",
    "7 in os07b .    )",
    "is indicated by the solid line , while the linear polarization ( @xmath44 ) is shown in dashed . panel-*b * : histogram for the magnetic field strength @xmath42 . panel-*c * : histogram for the inclination of the magnetic field vector @xmath20 . panel-*d * : histogram for the magnetic filling factor @xmath54 . in the last three panels ,",
    "the dashed lines display the histograms obtained from those pixels where any of three polarization profiles has a snr @xmath47 , whereas solid and dashed lines represent snr @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "these thresholds are also indicated with vertical lines in panel a. this figure corresponds to map a , where the characteristic noise level is @xmath56.,width=340 ]    .,width=340 ]    .,width=340 ]    a closer look to fig .",
    "3 - 5 reveals a couple of trends .",
    "the first one involves histograms for the same map ( noise - level @xmath52 fixed ) obtained with different signal - to - noise thresholds .",
    "here we observe that increasing the snr - threshold yields histograms for the magnetic field strength and magnetic filling - factor that shift towards higher values .",
    "in addition , the central peak at @xmath4 in the histogram for the inclination becomes less pronounced and almost disappears .",
    "still , the magnetic field still remains rather horizontal : @xmath57\\deg$ ] .",
    "one can interpret this trend in terms of the zeeman effect in the weak - field regime , through which the amplitude of the polarization signals is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "from this point of view , imposing larger snr - thresholds in the polarization immediately selects stronger fields .",
    "the histograms for @xmath20 ( inclination ) and @xmath54 ( magnetic filling - factor ) indicate that these stronger magnetic fields tend to be more vertical and to occupy a larger fraction of the resolution element .",
    "the second observed trend in the retrieved histograms is related to the map - to - map differences or , equivalently , to the noise level @xmath58 in the four components of the stokes vector . comparing figures",
    "3,4 and 5 reveals that the histogram of the magnetic field strength shifts towards lower values from map a ( @xmath59 ) to map c ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "again , this behavior can be explained as a consequence of being able to detect smaller polarization signals , hence weaker magnetic fields , when the noise is reduced .",
    "in addition , the disappearance of the peak at @xmath4 for large snr - thresholds is much less pronounced in map c than in maps a or b. an explanation for this will be offered in section 6 .",
    "figure 6 shows histograms for the longitudinal component of the magnetic field @xmath61 , and the transverse component of the magnetic field @xmath62 for the three analyzed maps : a ( top panels ) , b ( middle panels ) and c ( bottom panels ) . @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be identified with the projection of the magnetic field vector on the vertical direction to the solar surface and the projection of the magnetic field over the solar surface , respectively . because the retrieved magnetic fields are rather inclined ( @xmath65 ) , the horizontal component of the magnetic field @xmath64 is larger than the vertical component @xmath63 .",
    "we have calculated the center - of - gravity ( cog ) of the histograms for @xmath63 and @xmath64 in fig .  6 and plotted them as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio in figure 7 .",
    "if we take as a reference the results obtained from considering only those pixels whose polarization levels are 4.5 times above the noise level : snr@xmath66 , we then see that the cog of @xmath64 ( dashed lines ) is located at around 122.0 gauss for the map a ( @xmath59 ; crosses ) , and it decreases to 87.4 gauss when the noise level is @xmath8 ( map c ; diamonds ) .",
    "differences are even larger if we consider the peak - value ( instead of the cog ) in the histograms : 90.6 gauss in map a , and 57.1 gauss in map c. meanwhile , the cog values in the histogram of @xmath63 ( solid lines ) only decreases from 21.6 ( map a ; crosses ) to 11.9 gauss ( map c ; diamonds ) .",
    "similar trends are observed for other signal - to - noise thresholds .",
    "this indicates that both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are responsible for the decrease in the cog and peak value of @xmath42 when the noise level is reduced ( figs  .3b-5b ) , with @xmath67 being the main contributor",
    ".    figs .",
    "6 and 7 indicate that the cog and peak values in the histograms for @xmath63 and @xmath64 become smaller as the noise level decreases . in the light of this result ,",
    "is it possible that , the current noise levels in the polarization signals ( in all three maps considered ) is responsible for the large values of @xmath64 , and therefore for the peak at @xmath4 in the histograms for the inclinations ? and if so : is it conceivable that , given a low enough level of noise in the polarization signals , the detection thresholds for @xmath63 and @xmath64 would be similar , thereby opening the possibility for the detection of non - horizontal magnetic fields ? in the following",
    "we will address these two questions .",
    "in order to study the effect that the photon noise has on the retrieval of the inclination of the magnetic field vector in the quiet sun , we have performed the following monte - carlo - like test : we first produce a large number of synthetic profiles ( 1024@xmath132047 ) where we assume that the magnetic field is always vertical .",
    "half of the synthetic profiles posses @xmath68 , while the other half have @xmath69 .",
    "the rest of the milne - eddington parameters needed for the synthesis : @xmath70 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath28 etcetera ( see sect .",
    "3 ) are taken from the results of the inversion of map a. this is done in order to employ kinematic and thermodynamic parameters that are representative of the quiet sun .",
    "the only exception is the magnetic field strength @xmath42 : for the synthesis we assume @xmath42 to be equal to the vertical component of the field as obtained from the inversion of map a : @xmath71 .",
    "note that since @xmath72 this ensures that the vertical component of the magnetic field in this test is equal to the vertical component of the magnetic field from map a : @xmath73 .",
    "we then proceed to add noise at different levels and we employ the vfisv code ( see sect .  3 ) to invert the stokes profiles of 6302.5  allowing all atmospheric parameters , including the inclination @xmath20 , to vary freely .",
    "finally , we compare the original distributions for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with the retrieved ones . in our tests",
    "we have employed four different levels of noise : @xmath56 ( as in map a ) , @xmath77 ( as in map b ) , @xmath8 ( as in map c ) and finally , as an example of extremely high signal - to - noise observations , @xmath78 .",
    "all numbers are expressed in units of the continuum intensity in the quiet sun . as in section 4",
    ", our analysis considers only those profiles where the signal - to - noise ratio in _ at least one _ of the polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath10 ) is equal or larger than 3 , 4.5 and 6 .",

    "note that a more realistic estimation of the original @xmath79 is obtained by taken a lower snr - threshold since , as already mentioned in sect .",
    "4 , large snr - thresholds tend to retain only the stronger magnetic fields . this explains why the blue curves fail to obtain the correct distribution of vertical magnetic fields . only for the extreme case of @xmath80 choosing different snr - thresholds yields the correct distribution of @xmath79 .",
    "it is important to notice that the behavior of the curves in fig .",
    "8 closely resembles those in fig .",
    "6 for different snr - thresholds obtained form the inversion of hinode / sp data at different noise levels .",

    "it can be seen that , despite having an original distribution of magnetic fields which was purely vertical , the retrieved horizontal component of the magnetic field @xmath67 is much larger than the vertical component of the magnetic field @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "the only exception to this is the case where @xmath80 , in which case the values of @xmath67 and @xmath79 are of the same order .",
    "an important feature of figs .  8 and 9 , which shows a strong resemblance with what we have seen in the real data ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , is that the cog of the histograms ( indicated by the vertical - dashed color lines ) shifts towards lower values when the noise decreases .",
    "this happens for both @xmath79 and @xmath67 .",
    "as it can be expected from these results , the retrieved inclination is mostly horizontal .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 10 , where the histograms for the inclination of the magnetic field peak at around @xmath2 .",
    "this happens in spite of having started with vertical fields , whose distribution is represented in fig .",
    "10 by the two vertical black arrows at @xmath83 .",
    "the fact that we have obtained horizontal fields out of purely vertical ones is due to the sole effect of the photon noise .",

    "this was already seen from the inversions of real data : figs .",
    "however , this simulation fails to reproduce the fact that the observed drop at @xmath2 is less pronounced for smaller noise levels .",
    "the tests presented in this section demonstrate that it is possible to deduce the existence of horizontal fields from purely vertical ones due to the sole effect of photon noise .",
    "photon noise is also responsible for an overestimation in @xmath64 and therefore also in @xmath42 .",
    "these effects occur for noise levels as low as @xmath88 .",

    "finally it is important to mention a couple of consistency checks that have been carried out .",
    "the first one was performed in order to study if our results are biased as a consequence of the inability of the vfisv inversion code to invert both 6301.5  and 6302.5  spectral lines ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) , we have repeated our monte - carlo experiments using the sir inversion code ( ruiz cobo & del toro iniesta 1992 ) and inverting both spectral lines simultaneously . due to sir s",
    "limited speed we have run the experiment with only 5000 profiles , but this is sufficient to confirm the results presented throughout this section . the second consistency check is to repeat these experiments in the absence of photon noise . with this test",
    "we have confirmed that vertical magnetic fields are actually retrieved ( initial @xmath81-dirac distributions ) , and to test the convergence algorithm of the inversion code .",
    "in the inversion of observed hinode / sp data ( sect .",
    "4 ) we have applied a selection criteria that considers in the analysis all those pixels where _ any _ of the polarization signals ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath10 ) are above a certain signal - to - noise ratio . this is the same criteria applied in the analysis of simulated data in sect .  5 and also in os07a and os07b .    a very important consequence to be drawn from sect .",
    "5 is that the distributions for the magnetic field vector obtained from the inversion of the simulated data , are not trustworthy as long as stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dominated by noise .",
    "this was clearly the case in the inversion of the simulated data in that section since there it had been assumed that the magnetic field was vertical .",
    "it is therefore critical to study whether the aforementioned criteria , when applied to hinode / sp data , select pixels where the linear polarization profiles ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are above the noise or , on the contrary , where @xmath10 is the only stokes parameter above the noise . for the simulated data in sect .  5",
    ", the latter was certainly the case since the signals in @xmath6 and @xmath7 were due only to photon noise .",
    "what about the observations from hinode / sp employed in sect .  4 ?    in figure 11",
    "we show the percentage of pixels ( with respect to the total number of pixels in each hinode / sp map ) as a function of the snr - threshold applied . the three maps with different noise levels considered in sect .",
    "4 are indicated by the different symbols : crosses ( map a : @xmath59 ) , squares ( map b : @xmath89 ) , and diamonds ( map c : @xmath90 ) .",
    "here we have applied two different criteria .",
    "the first one is the same as in sect .  4 and 5 :",
    "a pixel is taken into account if _ any _ of three polarization profiles ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath10 ) has a given signal - to - noise ratio ( solid lines ) .",
    "the second one considers only those pixels were either @xmath6 or @xmath7 posses a certain signal - to - noise ratio ( dashed lines ) .",
    "taking as a reference a snr - threshold of 4.5 ( same as in os07a ) we find that 30.2 % of the pixels contained in map a posses at least _ one _ of polarization signal that is above this threshold .",
    "however , if we restrict our analysis to @xmath6 or @xmath7 only , we realize that only 3.4 % of the pixels fulfill this criteria .",
    "this implies that the vast majority of the pixels analyzed have linear polarization profiles that are dominated by noise and thus , as demonstrated in sect .  5",
    ", this automatically results into horizontal fields ( see fig .",
    "consequently , the peak at @xmath5 g and @xmath4 in fig .  3 in this work and also in fig .  3 in os07a",
    "is not real but due to noise .    in map c , with a much lower noise level than map a , up to 80.0 % of the pixels posses signals where at least one of the polarization profiles is above 4.5 times the noise level .",
    "however , the number drops to 31.6 % if we consider only @xmath6 or @xmath7 . as a consequence , only @xmath91 of the peaks at @xmath92 g and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "5 is real , with the remaining @xmath93 being due to noise .",
    "this explains why in map a the peak at @xmath2 disappears for large snr - thresholds : it is mostly noise ( fig .",
    "3c ) , while remaining in map c ( fig .  5c ) : part of the peak there is actually real .",
    "what is then the inclination and strength of the magnetic field vector in the pixels where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not above the noise level ?",
    "this represents 97 % of all pixels included in the analysis of fig .",
    "3 ( map a ) and about 70 % of all pixels included in the analysis of fig .  5 ( map c ) . as demonstrated in sect .",
    "5 it is possible that they are vertical @xmath94 with a field strength of @xmath95 g. however , as long as @xmath64 remains below our detection threshold this is only speculation .    in order to improve the reliability of the histograms for the magnetic field vector it is possible to repeat the analysis in sect .  4 but employing only those pixels where the linear polarization signals ( stokes @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) are 4.5 times above the noise level .",
    "in this case we still obtain the central peak at @xmath4 and @xmath96 g in all three maps considered .",
    "this was to be expected because , @xmath6 and @xmath7 signals sufficiently above the noise implies the existence of highly inclined magnetic fields ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is so because in the weak - field regime , the linear polarization is a second order effect ( landi deglinnocenti , 1992 ) in the magnetic field as compared to the circular polarization .",
    "used in the synthesis of the simulated data ( black ) .",
    "the retrieved distributions from the inversion are indicated by the color lines : snr @xmath47 ( red ) , snr @xmath48 ( green ) and snr @xmath49 ( blue ) .",
    "the cog of the retrieved histograms are indicated by the vertical dashed lines .",
    "each panel shows the results for different levels of noise : @xmath85 ( as in observed map a ; upper - left ) , @xmath86 ( as in observed map b ; upper - right ) , @xmath87 ( as in observed map c ; lower - left ) , and finally @xmath97.,width=340 ]    .",
    "the vertical black arrow indicates the original distribution employed to produce the synthetic stokes profiles : it s a @xmath81-dirac centered at 0 because the synthetic profiles were obtained assuming that the magnetic field is longitudinal / vertical ( @xmath98 ) and therefore @xmath99 .",
    "note however , that the effect of the noise induces the inversion code to retrieve large values for the transverse component of the magnetic field ( blue and red lines).,width=340 ]    .",
    "the vertical black arrows indicates the original distribution employed to produce the synthetic stokes profiles : it s a double @xmath81-dirac centered at 0@xmath100 and 180@xmath100 because the synthetic profiles were obtained assuming that the magnetic field is longitudinal / vertical .",
    "note however , that the effect of the noise induces the inversion code to retrieve highly inclined magnetic fields ( color lines).,width=340 ]    however , it is important to clarify that histograms obtained applying the selection criteria to the linear polarization would only contain a minority of internetwork pixels , leaving out many of them ( up to 90 % of internetwork pixels in map a or up to 70 % of pixels in map c ) whose inclination is unknown .",
    "our tests show that in order to correctly infer the inclination of those pixels where only stokes @xmath10 is above the signal , a noise level better than @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) is needed .    according to fig .",
    "11 one might think that , even though only 3.4 % of the pixels in map a and 31.6 % in map c , posses a signal - to - noise larger or equal to 4.5 , these numbers grow up to 69.6 % and 85.9 % respectively if a snr - threshold of 3 is considered .",
    "however , as explained in sect .  4 , snr @xmath47 is not sufficient to reliably infer the magnetic field vector because photon noise produces signals that are above 3 times the noise level in most of the pixels .",
    "in this paper we have studied the distribution of the magnetic field vector ( strength @xmath42 and inclination with respect to the vertical direction @xmath20 ) in internetwork regions with data from the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) on - board the japanese satellite hinode .",
    "we have selected three different maps recorded at disk center with different integration times , and therefore different noise levels . in all three cases , the retrieved inclination of the magnetic field peaks at @xmath4 , in agreement with previous results ( orozco surez et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "in addition , we have found that the distribution of vertical / longitudinal fields ( @xmath61 ) and horizontal / transverse fields ( @xmath102 ) shift towards smaller values when we analyze data with lower levels of photon noise . in spite of this decrease , the relation @xmath103 holds , which explains why all analyzed maps yield histograms for the inclination with a clear peak at @xmath4 .    ,",
    "@xmath7 or @xmath10 ) , whereas in dashed lines it is plotted the number of pixels when considering only the linear polarization ( stokes @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "symbols indicate each of the three maps employed : crosses ( map a ; @xmath85 ) , squares ( map b ; @xmath86 , and diamonds ( map c ; @xmath87.,width=340 ]    to understand this result we have carried out a monte - carlo - like simulation in which we produce a large number of synthetic profiles assuming vertical fields ( @xmath83 ) and , after adding photon noise at different levels , we invert the synthetic stokes profiles to investigate whether the original distributions ( @xmath81-dirac functions ) can be recovered .",
    "these tests show that , peaks at @xmath4 ( horizontal fields ) are obtained for noise levels as low as @xmath87 even though in the synthesis we had used only vertical ones .",
    "this means that the histograms for the inclination obtained with real data are contaminated to a large extent by the effect of the photon noise , which makes vertical and horizontal fields indistinguishable .",
    "to what extent the histograms are contaminated depends on the selection criteria employed to select pixels that enter in the analysis . if we select pixels where the signal - to - noise ratio in any of the polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath10 ) is above 4.5 , the contamination can be as large as 70 - 95% ( depending on the noise level ) .",
    "this renders the inferred distributions for the magnetic field inclination and transverse component of the magnetic field , meaningless .",
    "this is the approach followed in orozco surez et al .",
    "( 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "other authors such as lites et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and kobel ( 2009 ) impose a larger threshold for stokes @xmath10 ( snr @xmath49 ) than for stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( snr @xmath104 ) , which can partially avoid the contamination .",
    "a better approach is to analyze only those pixels where the linear polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) have a signal - to - noise ratio larger than or equal to 4.5 .",
    "this strategy has the advantage that the inclination of the magnetic field can be properly retrieved by the inversion of the radiative transfer equation applied to the observed stokes profiles .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by asensio ramos ( 2009 ) .",
    "the main shortcoming of this selection procedure is that it considers only small regions within the internetwork : 5 - 30 % ( depending on the noise level ) , leaving out large portions where the inclinations is not determined .",
    "we conclude therefore that the real distribution of inclinations in the quiet sun internetwork remains unknown .",
    "a proper inference can only be carried out with noise level that are beyond the current capabilities of modern spectropolarimeters .",
    "workarounds can be found by introducing temporal averages , but the required integration time exceeds the lifetime of granulation .",
    "it is therefore not clear what is being represented by histograms obtained with averages spanning several minutes .",
    "the importance of the photon noise has been already acknowledged by asensio ramos ( 2009 ) and stenflo ( 2010 ) . in the latter work ,",
    "results are interpreted in terms of an isotropic distribution of magnetic fields .",
    "however , these works do not analyze low - noise data , thus missing the contribution from pixels with strong @xmath6 and @xmath7 signals : up to 30 % of the total amount of pixels .",
    "the question is therefore whether an isotropic distribution of fields can explain these regions of truly horizontal fields .",
    "asensio ramos ( 2009 ; see also martnez gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ) also conclude that the distribution of magnetic fields is quasi - isotropic , however , whereas the latter refers to pixels where the polarization signal is above the noise level , the former infers a quasi - isotropic distribution only for those pixels whose polarization signal is below the noise .",
    "our work differs from these ones in that in our case we can explain many features of the resulting histograms for the inclination employing only vertical fields . in the future we intent to adress the possibility of isotropism in more detail .",
