    "the broad absorption lines ( bals ) , which appear in the uv spectra of @xmath2 quasars ( e.g. , tolea et al . 2002 ; reichard et al . 2003a ; hewett & foltz 2003 ) , are characterized by prominent broad and blueshifted absorption troughs due to ions of a wide range species from feii , mgii to ovi .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that bal region is present in all quasars but with covering factor much less than unit .",
    "the dichotomy of bal quasars and non - bal quasars is interpreted as an orientation effect .",
    "for instance , murray et al . (",
    "1995 ) suggested that bals present themselves in a minority of the quasar population when the line of sight passes through the accretion disk wind nearly at the equatorial plane .",
    "a detail study shows that such a scenario is also consistent with the continuum polarization and x - ray absorption in bal quasars ( wang , wang & wang 2005 ) .",
    "elvis ( 2000 ) appealed to a funnel - shaped thin shell outflow that arises from the accretion disk to explain various observational properties of quasars , including bals which are interpreted as `` normal '' quasars when the wind is viewed end - on .",
    "both orientation models require a rather large incline angle of @xmath3 for bal quasars .",
    "the determination of the inclination of the accretion disk in bal quasars is vital to understand the geometry of the bal outflow .",
    "the axis defined by relativistic radio jets , which is likely aligned with that of the accretion disk ( wills et al .",
    "1999 ) , can be used to infer the inclination angle of the accretion disk .",
    "becker et al . ( 2000 ) found that the 29 bal quasars discovered in the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) exhibit compact radio morphologies ( @xmath4 unresolved at @xmath5 resolution ) and show wide scatter in the radio spectral index ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 sources , @xmath9 ) . according to the unification model of radio - loud agns ( cf .",
    "urry & padovani 1995 ) , core - dominated flat - spectrum radio sources are those viewed close to the radio jet axis , while lobe - dominated steep - spectrum radio sources appear to be present at larger viewing angles .",
    "the radio morphology and spectra of fbqs bal quasars indicate that the orientation of bal quasars can be both face - on and edge - on , contrary to the simple unification model introduced above .",
    "however , their radio spectral indexes , derived from non - simultaneous observations , might be biased by radio variations . in addition , most first detected bal qsos are only radio - intermediate , for which it is unknown if the unification model based on radio - loud agn ( i.e. , core - dominated flat - spectrum radio sources are face - on ) still applies .",
    "also the size of radio - intermediate sources might be much smaller , such as the radio intermediate quasar iii zw 2 ( brunthaler et al . 2005 ) , thus observations with much higher spatial resolution is required to confirm its compactness .",
    "jiang & wang ( 2003 ) acquired high resolution vlbi images of three bal quasars at 1.6  ghz .",
    "they found one source is resolved into asymmetric two - sided structure and a bright central component at @xmath10 mas resolution .",
    "this morphology mimics a compact steep spectral ( css ) source , but its size is much smaller than the typical value for a css source . the other two sources remain unresolved at this resolution , indicating that they are viewed face - on .",
    "the radio flux variability , which is sometimes a better indicator of jet orientation than the radio morphology ( at a limited resolution and sensitivity ) and the spectral slope ( often based on non - simultaneous observations ) , has not hitherto been adequately explored .",
    "becker et al . ( 2000 ) commented that 5 bal quasars in their sample appear to be variable at 1.4 ghz , but no further concern was given . in this paper",
    "we use two - epoch observations at the same frequency of 1.4 ghz by first ( the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey , becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and nvss ( the nrao vla sky survey , condon et al . 1998 ) to study the radio variability of the bal quasars observed by sdss ( the sloan digital sky survey , york et al .",
    "we identify 6 ( probably another two ) bal quasars with radio variation with a few 10 percent .",
    "calculations based on the radio variations imply that these sources should be viewed face - on with inclination angles less than 20@xmath11 .",
    "this confirms the existence of polar bal outflows , opposite to the unification model for bal quasars . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath12= 70 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "our jumping - off point is the sdss quasar catalog ( the 3rd edition , schneider et al . 2005 , hereafter s05c for the catalog ) .",
    "its sky coverage is @xmath16 , which accounts for more than 2/5 of @xmath17 planed by sdss .",
    "s05c consists of the 46,420 quasars with @xmath18band absolute magnitudes @xmath19 and positional uncertainties @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , optically unresolved objects brighter than @xmath21 with first counterpart within @xmath22 are observed , which we are more interested in .    using the naro very large array in its b configuration , the first survey began in 1993",
    "was designed to explore the faint radio sky down to a limit of @xmath23 mjy with a resolution of @xmath24 fwhm . its sky coverage is mostly superposed with that of sdss .",
    "the first radio catalog was presented in white et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with a positional accuracy of @xmath25 ( with 90% confidence level ) . by matching the sc05 and the first catalog , we find 3,757 quasars in s05c with first counterparts within @xmath22 .",
    "considering the average source density of @xmath26 in the first survey , we expect only @xmath27 of these matches to be spurious .",
    "we note that the above cutoff is biased against quasars with extended radio morphologies , e.g. , lobe - dominated quasars .",
    "however , missing this kind of radio variable sources based on the data presently available ( see  2.2 ) and this does not influence our main results .",
    "after all , only @xmath28 lobe - dominated radio sources will be lost ( ivezic et al . 2002 ; lu et al . in preparation ) , and such sources only accounts for @xmath29 in a well - defined variable sample of de vries et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "nvss , using the vla in its more compact d and dnc configurations , was carried out between @xmath30 at the same frequency as first .",
    "nvss covers all the sky area of first , but with a higher survey limit of @xmath31 mjy and a lower resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "the positional uncertainties are estimated to be varying from @xmath33 for bright sources with flux density @xmath34 15 mjy to @xmath35 at the survey limit . with a typical background noise of 0.45 mjy ( about 3 times higher than that of first )",
    ", we expect that the nvss survey be able to detect all of the first sources with flux density @xmath36 mjy , provided that the radio sources do not variate .",
    "we first select quasars in s05c with redshift @xmath34 0.5 so that the mgii absorption trough ( or other bluer troughs ) , if presents , falls within the wavelength coverage of the sdss spectrograph ( @xmath37 ) . out of these quasars ,",
    "1,877 have first counterparts within @xmath22 and peak flux density @xmath38 5 mjy as measured by first .",
    "then the first images of all these 1,877 objects are visually inspected and classified into three categories : 1 ) compact radio sources , 2 ) marginally resolved radio sources , and 3 ) radio sources with complex morphology .",
    "the first category includes 1,482 radio point sources unresolved at the first resolution ( 79.0% ) .",
    "the second category includes 200 radio sources ( 10.7% ) , which often show core plus elongated ( jet - like ) structure , or a core embedded in weak diffuse emission .",
    "the third category includes 193 radio sources ( 10.7% ) , out of which 168 sources exhibit fanaroff - riley ii morphology ( fr - ii , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "we search for nvss counterparts for the quasars in all of the three categories within a @xmath39 matching radius ( @xmath40 of the nvss positional error at the survey limit ) .",
    "nvss counterparts are found for 1,838 of the 1,877 quasars within a @xmath39 with a false rate of less than 1% .",
    "two possibilities may lead unfindable of the 39 quasars as nvss counterparts within such a matching radius : 1 ) the flux falls below the nvss limit resulting from variability ; 2 ) the apparent centroid of the source is largely shifted due to contamination either by bright lobe(s ) or by nearby unrelated bright source(s ) .",
    "we compare the nvss and first images to distinguish between the two and find that all of the 39 cases are due to confusion effects .",
    "in fact , 21 of the 39 quasars show fr - ii morphology .",
    "these 39 quasars are excluded in our further analysis .",
    "this result indicates that care must be taken to compare the fluxes obtained during the two surveys .    as noted by de vries et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the flux densities between first and nvss are not directly comparable since the radio sources that are not resolved by nvss may be resolved by first . in this case",
    ", the peak flux is smaller than the integrated flux density .",
    "we define the variability ratio ( vr ) for each quasar as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the peak flux density measured by first and the integrated flux density measured by nvss .",
    "our variability ratio is conservative for selecting variable sources which are brighter in the first images .",
    "we estimate the significance of radio flux variability as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the nvss integrated flux uncertainty , and @xmath46 the first peak flux uncertainty .",
    "objects with @xmath47 and @xmath48 are taken as candidates radio variable quasars .",
    "this yields 154 candidate variable sources .",
    "we plot in figure [ f1 ] ( left panel ) variability ratio vr against the peak flux density measured by first @xmath42 .",
    "the apparent dependence of vr on @xmath42 is due to the combination of two facts , the dependence of measurement error on flux density and the confusion effects in the nvss .",
    "the latter complication also induces the obvious asymmetric distribute of these sources around @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , all but three ( sdss j160953.42 + 433411.5 , sdss j101754.85 + 470529.3 , and sdss j164928.87 + 304652.4 ) of radio sources that are well resolved by first have @xmath50 . a more symmetric distribution can be found if only point radio sources and marginally resolved radio sources ( symbols in blue and red color ) are considered .",
    "isolated compact sources located well below @xmath51 are likely radio variable quasars .",
    "but new observations with higher resolution are needed to confirm this .",
    "out of the three quasars with complex radio morphology and @xmath52 ( all are fr - ii quasars ) , sdss j160953.42 + 433411.5 has @xmath53 and @xmath54 , fulfilling our selection criteria .",
    "after careful examination of its first and nvss image , we find confusion effects in nvss are serious in this source and exclude it from our sample .",
    "out of rest 153 candidates , 151 are point radio sources and 2 are marginally resolved .",
    "their nvss and first images are all visually examined for possible contamination by unrelated nearby bright sources , and one of them , sdss j111344.84 - 004411.6 , is removed for this reason .",
    "in addition , sdss j094420.44 + 613550.1 is eliminated from the sample because the nvss pipeline gives a wrong flux density for this object . at last",
    ", we end up with a sample of 151 candidate radio variable quasars . using the first integrated flux density and the sdss psf magnitudes",
    ", we calculate the radio - loudness ( rl ) of these quasars , defined as the k - corrected ratio of the 5 ghz radio flux to the near ultraviolet flux at 2 500  , @xmath55 .",
    "a power law slope of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is assumed for radio emission since their radio spectra are likely flat ( wang et al . 2005 ) , and the sdss colors are used for the optical - uv emission .",

    "only a few quasars have been found to show    hei absorption lines ( e.g. , anderson 1974 ; arav et al . 2001 ; hall et    al .",
    "the origin of radio variability can be either extrinsic or intrinsic .",
    "the most familiar mechanism of extrinsic variability of radio sources is refractive interstellar scintillation ( iss , e.g. , blandford , narayan , & romani 1986 ) .",
    "however , the variability amplitudes induced by iss is seldom larger than @xmath82 .",
    "considering the fact that all the 6 bal quasars and the two bal candidates we selected show radio variation with amplitude @xmath34 @xmath83 ( figure [ f1 ] and table [ t1 ] ) , it is reasonable to believe that the radio variabilities of these bal quasars are intrinsic to the radio sources .",
    "marscher & gear ( 1985 ) suggested that shocks propagating along the radio jets can induce flux variability .",
    "amplitude of variability can be largely amplified by relativistic beaming effect if the radio jets are viewed nearly face - on .",
    "a lower limit of the brightness temperature can be inferred as follows ( krolik 1999 ) , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the variable part of the radio power computed from the difference between the first and nvss fluxes , @xmath86 the time interval in the source rest frame between two observations , and @xmath87 the boltzmann constant .",
    "we present @xmath88 for the 6 bal quasars and the 2 candidates in table [ t1 ] .",
    "we find that the brightness temperatures of all 8 radio sources are much larger than the inverse compton limit of @xmath89 k ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "such extremely large brightness temperatures strongly suggest the presence of relativistic jet beaming toward the observer .",
    "if the intrinsic brightness temperature of the radio sources is less than the inverse compton limit , we can set a lower limit on their doppler factor , @xmath90 , and hence an upper limit of the inclination angle , @xmath91\\beta^{-1}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the lorentz factor of the jets .",

    "1999 ) instead of the inverse compton value of @xmath89 k is adopted as the maximum intrinsic brightness temperature , the inclination angle of our sample of bal quasars should all be less than @xmath96 .",
    "therefore polar bal outflows must be present in these radio variable quasars , contrary to the simple unification models of bal and non - bal quasars , which hypothesize bal quasars are normal quasars seen nearly edge - on .",
    "similar to most first detected sdss bal quasars ( menou et al .",

    "371853.7 is the only exceptionally very radio - loud bal quasar in our sample .",
    "we note , however , its spectrum is significantly reddened with @xmath99 . correcting for this intrinsic extinction would place the quasar in the radio - intermediate range with @xmath100 .",
    "since the radio emission is likely boosted greatly by the relativistic motion of the jet as indicated by its large brightness temperature , most of these sources would be intrinsically radio - weak or at most radio - intermediate .",

    "<S> using the radio observations by first and nvss , we build a sample of 151 radio variable quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss dr3 ) . </S>",

    "<S> such large amplitudes of the variations imply brightness temperatures much higher than the inverse compton limits ( 10@xmath0 k ) in all the bal quasars , suggesting the presence of relativistic jets beaming toward the observer . </S>",
    "<S> the angle between the outflow and the jet is constrained to be less than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such bal quasars with polar outflows are beyond the simple unification models of bal quasars and non - bal quasars , which hypothesize that bal quasars are normal quasars seen nearly edge - on . </S>"
