    "solid helium , the well - known example of a quantum solid , continues to be a subject of interest to theorists and experimentalists alike .",
    "it is characterized by large zero - point motion and significant short - range correlation of its atoms .",
    "these effects make the theoretical description of the solid very difficult .",
    "the self - consistent phonon ( scp ) method,@xcite which has been developed over the years to treat this problem , takes into account the high anharmonicity and short - range correlations in order to calculate the dynamical properties of solid helium .",
    "the predictions of the scp agree well with experiment in the fcc and hcp solid phases . in the low - density bcc phase , the agreement between the theory and experiment is less satisfactory , in particular regarding the transverse phonons along the [ 110 ] direction.@xcite the scp theory is a variational perturbative theory , and is implemented at zero - temperature.@xcite as a complementary approach to the scp , numerical simulations have been performed over the years .",
    "boninsegni and ceperley@xcite used path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) to calculate the phonon spectrum of liquid @xmath0he at finite temperature .",
    "galli and reatto @xcite used the shadow wave function approach to obtain the spectra of longitudinal phonons in hcp and bcc @xmath0he at zero temperature .",
    "recently , interest in the properties of quantum solids has been revived , following reports indicating the possible existence of a `` supersolid '' in the hcp phase@xcite .",
    "in addition , an optic - like excitation branch was recently discovered in the bcc phase by markovich et al ,  @xcite ( in a mono - atomic cubic solid , one should observe only 3 acoustic phonon branches ) .",
    "these results indicate that the physics of solid helium is not yet entirely understood .",
    "al.@xcite proposed that the new excitation branch is a result of the coupling of transverse phonons to additional degrees of freedom , unique to a quantum solid .    in order to reexamine some of these issues using an alternative approach",
    ", we decided to study the excitations in bcc solid helium @xmath0he , by performing quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations at a finite temperature .",
    "we use path integral monte carlo ( pimc)@xcite , which is a non - perturbative numerical method , that allows , in principle , simulations of quantum systems without any assumptions beyond the schr@xmath2dinger equation .",
    "the two body interatomic he - he potential @xcite is the only input for the pimc simulations . in our study",
    "the universal path integral ( upi ) code of ceperley@xcite was adapted to calculate the phonon branches at finite temperature .",
    "the novel features of our study include the calculation of the transverse phonon branches of bcc @xmath0he at a finite temperature of 1.6 k where this phase is stable .",
    "transverse phonons are of particular interest due to their possible relation with the new optic - like excitation@xcite . for longitudinal phonons ,",
    "we observe a difference between dispersion relations resulting from the single - phonon part of dynamic structure factor and the total structure factor .",
    "this difference becomes significant at large wavevectors .",
    "finally , we repeated our calculations of the longitudinal phonon spectra in the presence of point defects and evaluate the formation energy of a vacancy at a constant density and at a constant volume .",
    "we describe details of our simulations in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of our calculations , and summarize them in sec .",
    "the pimc method used in our simulations is based on the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals .",
    "it has been described in detail by ceperley  @xcite .",
    "the method involves mapping of the quantum system of particles onto a classical model of interacting `` ring polymers '' , whose elements , `` beads '' or `` time - slices '' , are connected by `` springs '' .",
    "the method provides a direct statistical evaluation of quantum canonical averages .",
    "in addition to static properties of the system , dynamical properties can be also extracted from pimc simulations.@xcite    the object of this study is the phonon spectrum , which can be extracted from the dynamic structure factor , @xmath3 .",
    "we would like to express @xmath3 in terms of phonon operators  @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath3 in terms of density fluctuations is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the momentum and energy ( we take @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the fourier transform of the density of the solid , and @xmath9 is the number density .",
    "@xmath3 is usually expressed in terms of phonons , by writing @xmath3 as a sum of terms involving the excitation of a single phonon , @xmath10 , a pair of phonons , @xmath11 and higher order terms which also include interference between different terms .",
    "@xcite in most of our simulations we calculated the @xmath12 term .",
    "some calculations of @xmath3 were also performed , and will be discussed below .",
    "taking the instantaneous position @xmath13 of atom @xmath14 as the lattice point @xmath15 plus a displacement @xmath16 , we rewrite @xmath17 in terms of these displacements . the one - phonon contribution",
    "is then given by  @xcite @xmath18[{\\bf q } { \\bf u}(l,0 ) ]   \\right>,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the debye - waller factor .",
    "the displacement @xmath20 can be expressed using the phonon operators @xmath21  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phonon wave - vector , @xmath24 is the phonon branch index , and @xmath25 are polarization vectors , chosen along the directions [ 001],[011 ] and [ 111 ] .",
    "using @xmath26 , the one - phonon term @xmath27 for a specific phonon branch is rewritten as  @xcite @xmath28 ^ 2 e^{i\\omega t}dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the delta function , and @xmath30 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "we use @xmath31 , which lies inside the first brillouin zone and parallel to one of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the intermediate scattering function .",
    "we can not directly follow the dynamics of helium atoms in real time using the quantum monte carlo method .",
    "however , we can extract information about the dynamics by means of the analytical continuation of @xmath37 to the complex plane  @xcite @xmath38 . using imaginary - time ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the intermediate scattering function , and @xmath41 .    in our simulations , we sampled the displacement @xmath42 for each `` time - slice '' @xmath43 of the @xmath14-th atom represented by a `` ring polymer '' , and calculated @xmath44 by performing spatial fourier transformation @xmath45 using ( [ ag ] ) , @xmath46 is obtained as a quantum canonical average of the product of the phonon operator @xmath47 in equilibrium .    in order to calculate @xmath48 from eq.([upi ] ) , we need to perform an inverse laplace transformation . performing",
    "this inversion is a difficult numerical problem ,  @xcite because of the inherent statistical uncertainty of noisy pimc data",
    ". the noise rules out an unambiguous reconstruction of the @xmath48 .",
    "the best route to circumvent this problem is to apply the maximum entropy ( maxent )  @xcite method that makes the laplace inversion better conditioned .",
    "the maxent method yields a dynamic scattering function , @xmath48 which satisfies eq .",
    "( 7 ) and at the same time maximizes the conditional probability imposed by our knowledge of the system .",
    "this can be done if some properties of @xmath49 are known .",
    "for example , the dynamic scattering factor is a non - negative function , and has certain asymptotic behavior at small and large @xmath50 . in the maxent method",
    "the probability to observe of a given dynamic scattering function is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability to observe @xmath53 for given set of sampled @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the likelihood , @xmath56 is a parameter and @xmath57 is the entropy  @xcite . to simplify our notation",
    ", we use @xmath58 below to denote by the one - phonon dynamic structure @xmath48 for a given @xmath59 and @xmath24 , and omit the explicit dependence on @xmath59 and @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , we replace @xmath60 by @xmath61 . the likelihood @xmath55 is given by @xmath62 where the kernel @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 the covariance matrix , @xmath65 , describes the correlation between the different time slices @xmath43 for a given atom ( `` ring '' polymer ) .",
    "this matrix is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is obtained as an average over all atoms at a given time slice @xmath43 .",
    "because @xmath68 is periodic as one goes around the polymer@xcite , the summation on @xmath43 is done for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the total number of time - slices in a `` polymer ring '' .",
    "the entropy term @xmath71 is added to @xmath55 in order to make the reconstruction procedure better conditioned@xcite .",
    "we remark here that in some qmc simulations only the diagonal elements of @xmath72 are taken into account  @xcite , but here we use all the elements , because the @xmath67 at different @xmath43 are correlated with each other .    although @xmath55 measures how closely any form of @xmath58 approximates the solution of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , one can not determine @xmath58 reliably from pimc using @xmath55 alone.@xcite to make this determination , one needs to add the entropy term @xmath71 to @xmath55 in ( 9 ) to make the reconstruction procedure better conditioned .",
    "the entropy term is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 includes our prior knowledge about the properties of @xmath58 , examples of which were given above .",
    "the simplest choice of @xmath58 is the flat model , in which @xmath74=const for a selected range of frequencies and zero otherwise .",
    "we took a cutoff frequency corresponding to an energy of 100k .",
    "this flat model is used as an input for most of our simulations .",
    "in addition , we used a `` self - consistent '' model where the output of a previous maxent reconstruction is used as input for the next maxent reconstruction in an iterative fashion  @xcite the flat model is taken for the initial iteration .",
    "finally , we also tried @xmath74 with gaussian and lorentzian shape , with peaks given by the scp theory and experiment .",
    "as explained below , the outcome is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath74 provided the pimc data are of good quality .",
    "finally , we discuss the parameter @xmath56 in ( 9 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this parameter controls the relative weight of the pimc data vs. the entropy term in the determination of @xmath75 .",
    "there are different strategies to obtain @xmath56 . in our simulations",
    "we used both the `` classical '' maxent method  @xcite and random walk sampling.@xcite the `` classical '' maxent method picks the best value of @xmath56 , while random walk sampling calculates a distribution of @xmath56 , @xmath76 .",
    "next , for each value of @xmath56 we calculate @xmath58 .",
    "the final @xmath58 is obtained as a weighted average over @xmath56 .",
    "we found that when the collected pimc data is of good quality , the distribution @xmath76 becomes sharply peaked and symmetric , and the phonon spectra obtained by means of `` classical '' maxent and random walk are almost the same .",
    "good quality data are characterized by an absence of correlation between sequential pimc steps and by small statistical errors .",
    "the maxent method assumes that the distribution of the sampled @xmath77 is gaussian.@xcite we re - block@xcite the sampled values of @xmath61 in order to reduce the correlations and to make the distribution as close as possible to a gaussian , with zero third ( skewness ) and fourth ( kurtosis ) moments .",
    "the criterion determining the minimum number of sampled data points comes from the properties of the covariance matrix @xmath65 .",
    "if there are not enough blocks of data the covariance matrix becomes pathological.@xcite therefore , the number of blocks must be larger than the number of time slices in a `` ring''polymer . in our simulations , each atom is represented by a `` ring''polymer with 64 time slices .",
    "we collected at least 300 blocks in each simulation run .",
    "we found that at least 10000 data points were required in order to obtain the 300 blocks .",
    "each simulation run took about two weeks of 12 pentium iii pcs running in parallel .",
    "statistical errors were estimated by running the pimc simulations 10 times , with different initial conditions in each case .",
    "after each run , @xmath78 was extracted using the maxent method .",
    "the phonon energy for a given @xmath79 was then calculated by averaging the positions of the peak of @xmath78 over the set of the simulation runs .",
    "the error bars of each point shown in the figures below represent the standard deviation .",
    "( color online ) longitudinal component of the dynamic structure factor , @xmath78 , for q = 0.83 r.l.u . along the [ 100 ] direction : single phonon contribution ( circles , red online ) , and total structure factor ( squares , black online ) .",
    "the lines are a guide to the eye . ]    in the simulations we used samples containing between 128 and 432 atoms .",
    "this allowed us to calculate @xmath78 for values of @xmath80 between 0.17 and 1 in relative lattice units ( r.l.u.= 2@xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the lattice parameter ) .",
    "the number density was set to @xmath83 and the temperature was @xmath84 .",
    "a perfect bcc lattice was chosen as the initial configuration .",
    "the effects of bose statistics are not taken into account in our simulation , which is a reasonable approximation for the solid phase .",
