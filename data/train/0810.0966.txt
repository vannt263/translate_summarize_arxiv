    "the laplacian @xmath11 is symmetric and all its eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "the first eigenvalue is always @xmath15 .",
    "the second smallest eigenvalue , denoted by @xmath16 in the following , has become quite popular and is called the _ algebraic connectivity _ of @xmath4 by @xcite .",
    "it allows some conclusions about the connectedness of the graph .",
    "a graph @xmath4 is connected if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 is a lower bound for the vertex and edge connectivities of @xmath4 .",
    "hence properties of the algebraic connectivity has been investigated in the literature . in particular",
    "many upper and lower bounds have been shown .",
    "we refer to the recent survey by @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "other authors have ordered trees by their algebraic connectivity @xcite or characterize extremal graphs , i.e. , graphs that have minimal algebraic connectivity among all graph within particular graph class .",
    "@xcite assume that _ graphs with small values of @xmath16 tend to be elongated graphs of large diameter with bridges .",
    "_ for example , for trees on @xmath3 vertices with a fixed diameter the algebraic connectivity is minimized for paths with stars of ( almost ) equal size attached to both ends , see @xcite .",

    "@xcite used the agx - system which raised the conjecture that the connected graphs @xmath18 with minimal algebraic connectivity are all so called @xmath19-path - complete graphs .    in this note",

    "we call a degree sequence for a tree a _ tree sequence_. we show that such a tree is a _ caterpillar _ ,",
    "i.e. , a tree in which the removal of all pendant vertices ( vertices of degree 1 ) gives a path . for further characterization",
    "we use a result of @xcite about eigenvectors of the second smallest eigenvalue which are called _ fiedler vectors _ : the subgraph induced by non - positive vertices of any fiedler vector ( i.e. , vertices with non - positive valuation ) and the subgraph induced non - negative vertices are both connected .",
    "such connected subgraphs are called _ weak nodal domains _ @xcite ( in analogy to eigenfunctions of the laplace - beltrami operator on manifolds @xcite ) , or _ perron components _ @xcite .",
    "the two nodal domains of a fiedler vector of a tree are either separated by an edge ( _ characteristic edge _ ) or there is a single vertex ( _ characteristic vertex _ ) where the fiedler vector vanishes @xcite . on each of these nodal domains",

    "it is an open problem how the degree sequence @xmath24 has to be partitioned for the two nodal domains to obtain a tree with minimum algebraic connectivity .",
    "we ran some computational experiments but could not detect any general pattern .",
    "for the proof of this theorem we use the concept of _ geometric nodal domains _ and _ dirichlet matrix _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "this concept is described in sect .",

    "we then can use perturbation of trees to obtain results for the first dirichlet eigenvalue for each of the two nodal domains of the fiedler vector ( sect .",

    "our approach is related to the concept of _ perron components _ and _ `` bottleneck '' matrix _ introduced in @xcite .",
