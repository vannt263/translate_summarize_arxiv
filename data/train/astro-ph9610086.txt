    "like variations in refractive index , the changes in spacetime metric produced by gravitational waves alter optical path lengths .",
    "light propagation through gravitational waves preserves sources surface brightness and total intensity , to first order in the wave amplitude ( @xcite ) ; but it can produce oscillations in apparent position , at the period of the gravitational wave ( @xcite ) . over time intervals",
    "much shorter then a gravitational wave period , these deflections cause a characteristic pattern of apparent motions in the plane of the sky ( in astronomical parlance , proper motions ) ( @xcite ) . in this letter",
    "we set stringent upper limits on the energy density of such waves , using measurements of the proper motions of quasars .",
    "although detected only indirectly to date , most cosmologists believe gravitational waves are commonplace .",
    "very low - frequency gravitational waves arise naturally in inflationary cosmologies ( @xcite ) and dominate the mass - energy of the universe in some of them(@xcite ) .",
    "other possible sources of such a background include phase transitions in the early universe , networks of cosmic strings , and collisions of bubbles ( @xcite ) .",
    "various observations set direct or indirect observational constraints on the spectrum of low - frequency gravitational radiation .",
    "these constraints are often expressed in terms of @xmath2 , the ratio of the mass - energy density of the gravitational waves to that required to close the universe .",
    "some observational constraints are sensitive to a narrow range of frequencies , and are best expressed in terms of the logarithmic derivative @xmath3 evaluated at some frequency @xmath4 .",
    "timing of pulsars sets observational limits for periods as great as the span of observations ( @xcite ) . for the extremely stable millisecond",
    "pulsars the limit corresponds to @xmath5 , at frequency @xmath6  hz ( @xcite ) . after taking into account",
    "the energy carried away by gravitational waves and the effects of galactocentric acceleration , orbital periods of binary pulsars are sensitive to gravitational waves with periods as great as the light travel time from the pulser .",
    "current limits from such data sets a limit of @xmath7 for @xmath8  hz , and of @xmath9 for @xmath10  hz ( @xcite ) . here , the normalized hubble constant is @xmath11 .",
    "these measurements are sensitive to gravitational waves with periods as great as the light travel time from the pulsar .",
    "a cosmological background of gravitational waves at the epoch of recombination can produce anisotropies of the cosmic background radiation ( @xcite ) . for gravitational - wave spectra typical of inflation , the anisotropy detected by cobe yields a limit of @xmath12 , with sensitivity of the measurement concentrated near @xmath13  gpc , or @xmath14  hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "few constraints have been set in the frequecy range @xmath15  hz linder ( 1988b ) found that a gravitational - wave background in this frequency range would affect the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , but robust calculations would require knowledge of the `` true '' correlation function , observable only in the absence of such a background .",
    "in contrast to these techniques , proper motions of extragalactic radio sources are sensitive to waves of arbitrarily long wavelength , and are independent of the spectrum and source of gravitational - wave radiation . under the assumption that the spectrum of gravitational waves is stochastic , the squared proper motion of distant sources , suitably averaged over the sky , is proportional to the energy density of the waves , at frequencies from the inverse of the period of observation to the hubble time .    in a previous paper(@xcite ) we discuss the pattern of apparent proper motions of distant radio sources , produced by a gravitational wave .",
    "we use the assumption that the wavelength is short compared to the distance to the source , and the adiabatic approximation that the wavelength is less than the hubble length ; however , because the observed effect is local to the earth , these assumptions can probably be relaxed without much change in the result .",
    "the best present measurements of proper motions attain accuracies of a few microarcseconds ( @xmath16as ) per year ( @xcite ) corresponding to observational limits on the energy density of gravitational waves of about that required to close the universe .",
    "very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measures positions of radio sources by measuring the difference in arrival times of their signals at antennas in different geographical locations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the interferometrist assumes that the observations are made in a locally minkowski reference frame ( allowing for the orbital acceleration of the earth and the general - relativistic light - bending of the sun and planets ) , and so interprets these observations in the gaussian normal reference frame .",
    "the delay @xmath17 between arrival times measures the projection of the unit vector pointing toward the source onto the spacelike baseline vector that connects the antennas .",
    "measurement of the delay for many sources on several baselines allows solution for both source positions and lengths and orientations of the baselines .",
    "pyne et al . ( 1996 ) describe the effect of a gravitational wave on a vlb interferometer : the wave produces variations in delay @xmath17 , which are interpreted as variations in source position .",
    "a gravitational wave traveling toward @xmath18 , with the `` @xmath19 '' polarization , produces metric perturbations @xmath20 in the background coordinate reference frame , where @xmath21 is the dimensionless strain of the wave , @xmath22 is its angular frequency , and @xmath23 is time . in the interferometrist s gaussian normal frame , the observed proper motion @xmath24 of a radio source at position @xmath25 will be : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 measures angle from @xmath18 , the direction of propagation of the wave , and @xmath28 measures azimuthal angle around it , from the @xmath29-axis ; the associated unit vectors on the sky are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "proper time in the gaussian normal frame is @xmath32 .",
    "we take @xmath21 to be real , and allow the origin of time @xmath32 to express the phase of the wave .",
    "1 shows the pattern of proper motions that this gravitational wave produces .",
    "the properties of this pattern of proper motions are not simple under rotation or superposition .",
    "however , the transverse vector spherical harmonics @xmath33 form an orthonormal basis for vector fields on a sphere , with well - understood behavior under rotation and superposition . expanded in such harmonics , eq .  ( [ pattern ] ) takes the form : @xmath34\\\\ \\label{tvshexp } & & -{{\\sqrt{70\\pi}}\\over{60 } } \\bigl[{\\bf y}^{\\rm",

    "these fall into 2 categories , with one family , commonly denoted `` poloidal '' , `` potential '' , or `` electric '' pointing down the gradients of scalar spherical harmonics ; and the other , known as `` toroidal '' , `` stream '' , or `` magnetic '' pointing perpendicular to their gradients .",
    "we denote these categories as `` e '' and `` m '' , respectively ( @xcite ) , with the notation @xmath35 meaning `` e or m '' .",
    "note that our @xmath36 is the @xmath37 of jackson ( 1975 ) .",
    "the normalization condition is : @xmath38 here @xmath39 denotes an average over the sky .    because the @xmath40 form an orthonormal basis for vector fields on a sphere , they can represent proper motions due to a single wave , or any spectrum of waves .",
    "we use the expansion @xmath41",
    "\\label{defas}\\ ] ] to define the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 in terms of the proper motion @xmath24 , observed over a small fraction of a gravitational wave period .",
    "the @xmath44 must satisfy ( @xcite ) : @xmath45 because @xmath24 is real .",
    "the squared proper motion averaged over the sky is related to the energy density of the wave @xmath46 by @xmath47 here @xmath48 includes an average over many wave periods , as well as over the sky .",
    "expansion of the mean square proper motion in vector spherical harmonics shows that 5/6 of the mean square motion resides in the @xmath49 harmonics : @xmath50 because the summed , squared moduli of the @xmath44 remain constant under rotation for for each @xmath51 , and for @xmath52 and @xmath53 harmonics separately , eq .  ( [ 562nd ] ) holds for a gravitational wave propagating in any direction with any polarization .",
    "if the phases , amplitudes and directions of the many superposed waves in the spectrum are random at the earth , as is to be expected for a cosmological background of gravitational waves , the random - phase approximation shows that eqs .",
    "( [ nutgw ] ) and ( [ 562nd ] ) will hold statistically , if @xmath54 is replaced by the integral @xmath55 , and if the average of the squared proper motion over time and sky is replaced by an average over an ensemble of gravitational - wave spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath56 is the spectral density of the square of the dimensionless strain .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ 562nd ] ) shows that 5/6 of the mean square proper motion due to the low - frequency gravitational wave background appears in second - order transverse spherical harmonics , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 harmonics contribute equally .",
    "we can express the energy density in such a stochastic background of gravitational waves as @xmath57 , its ratio to the closure density of the universe , @xmath58 ; and we can relate @xmath57 to proper motion in second - order transverse harmonics : @xmath59 we seek to measure the @xmath60 and to thus measure , or set limits on , @xmath57 .",
    "we searched for the pattern expected for gravitational waves in proper motions of extragalactic radio sources .",
    "we estimated second - order spherical harmonics from a proper - motion solution using the us naval observatory comprehensive database of vlbi observations .",
    "this contains most of the suitable astrometric and geodetic observations of extragalactic radio sources made with the mark iii and compatible vlbi systems@xcite .",
    "eubanks and matsakis @xcite describe the data analysis in detail ; here we present a brief overview .",
    "the database comprises 1,469,793 observations of delay @xmath17 and its time derivative @xmath61 with different baselines and sources .",
    "the observations were made between 3 august 1979 and 13 february 1996 , with more than 70% after 1990 .",
    "proper motions were determined for the 499 sources observed at more than 1 epoch . in fitting for the coefficients of transverse spherical harmonics we used the 323 sources known to be extragalactic by their measured redshifts .",
    "their mean redshift is 1.22 .",
    "reduction of this data to source positions and proper motions follows standard procedures for astrometric and geodetic vlbi data ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we removed the best models for earth orientation , tidal deformation , and location within the solar system ; atmospheric propagation ; and solar - system effects of general and special relativity ; before fitting for proper motion .",
    "simultaneous observations at 2 frequencies allowed calibration of the propagation delay through the ionosphere .",
    "the solutions for proper motions also included @xmath62 `` nuisance '' parameters , including those describing positions of sources and stations ; clock behavior at different stations ; optical path length though the atmosphere in a vertical direction and its horizontal gradients ; unmodeled motions of the earth , including variations in rotation , polar motion , nutation , and precession ; and gravitational deflection of light by the sun @xcite .",
    "these nuisance parameters are chosen to have little covariance with source and station positions , and thus to proper motions .",
    "after the fit , the weighted root - mean - square of the scatters of the residuals in delay and in delay rate were 31 ps and 93  fs  s@xmath63 , respectively .",
    "effects of source structure and variations in atmospheric path length are among the expected systematic errors .",
    "the sources are highly energetic neighborhoods of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the well - known motions of jets from such sources can mimic proper motion , particularly in cases where the stationary core component is weak or absent ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such motions are expected to be many @xmath64 , but should not be correlated over the sky , so that they increase noise in the measurements but do not bias lower - order transverse spherical harmonics .",
    "atmospheric path length is removed via models incorporating contemporaneous meteorological data , and the residual path length and its horizontal gradients are parametrized and estimated directly from the vlbi solution . remaining atmospheric delay errors might show angular dependences that could mimic those expected for gravitational waves .",
    "we then fit transverse spherical harmonics to the measured proper motions .",
    "the fit minimized @xmath65 , the summed , squared differences of proper motions and the motions modeled by eqs .",
    "( [ defas ] ) and ( [ realcond ] ) .",
    "these differences were weighted by the expected errors , given by the standard errors from the fit to delay and delay rate , scaled by a factor of 1.35 , and with an assumed error added in quadrature ( in each component of proper motion ) of 30  @xmath66 .",
    "this reweighting serves to make the @xmath65 per degree of freedom about 1 , as expected ; it accounts , in particular , for effects of variations in source structure .",
    "comparison of fits to subsets of the data suggested this scaling and addition in quadrature .",
    "fits to subsets of the data did not change the fitted values significantly , although the standard errors increased .",
    "the fit included coefficients for @xmath67 transverse spherical harmonics , as well as the @xmath49 harmonics characteristic of gravitational waves .",
    "the @xmath53 @xmath67 harmonics correspond to a rotation , of no physical significance , as it is not separable from the earth s rotation ; the @xmath52 @xmath67 harmonics correspond to acceleration not included in models used for data reduction .",
    "this acceleration is an interesting cosmological parameter : it is sensitive to the galactocentric acceleration of the solar system , as well as any acceleration of the milky way relative to distant quasars .",
    "the measured values of the coefficients of second - order transverse spherical harmonics are statistically indistinguishable from noise .",
    "the residual @xmath65 to the fit was 717 , distributed among 627 degrees of freedom .",
    "table 1 summarizes results of the fit , and fig .",
    "1 shows the results for the @xmath49 harmonics in graphical form .",
    "the fitted coefficients are combinations of @xmath44 that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ realcond ] ) to produce real motions .",
    "the mild migration of sources away from the ecliptic in fig .",
    "1 may reflect effects of the sun on atmospheric propagation .",
    "a particular value of @xmath57 corresponds to an ensemble of possible gravitational - wave spectra and coefficients @xmath60 .",
    "( [ omegaa2 ] ) relates @xmath57 to the mean over the ensemble of the summed , squared coefficients .",
    "the measurement errors given in the last column of table 1 also contribute to the measured @xmath60 .",
    "we take these contributions into account to find the value of @xmath57 that yields summed , squared coefficients less than those we observe for only 5% of gravitational spectra , and adopt this as our upper limit .",
    "this procedure includes effects of sample or cosmic variance . with 95% confidence , we find that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "this limit holds for a stochastic spectrum of gravitational waves integrated over all frequencies less than half the inverse of the 10-yr span of the observations , or about @xmath70  hz .",
    "considerable improvement in this limit should be possible over the next decade .",
    "the measurement accuracy for proper motions is proportional to the duration of observations to the 3/2 power .",
    "because most data were acquired in the last 5 to 10 years , an additional decade of observing should improve the bound on @xmath57 by a factor of 3 to 8 .",
    "moreover , we can reduce effects of source structure by choosing additional sources with little structure , from among the thousands observable astrometrically with the very long baseline array ; and by using models derived from images of the sources to correct for effects of structure directly .",
    "together these improvements may be expected to reduce the formal errors of measurements of @xmath57 by a factor of 10 to 100 , within the next 10 years .",
