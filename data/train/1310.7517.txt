    "by measuring the distortions of background galaxy shapes by foreground masses ( galaxies , galaxy clusters , and large - scale structures ) , weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) surveys probe the mass density fluctuations throughout the cosmic span ( see recent reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "wl observations , in conjunction with cosmological simulations , can be used to place precise constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "recent wl surveys , such as cosmos @xcite and cfhtlens @xcite , have measured the shear power spectrum and have already placed useful constraints on @xmath5 ( the matter density of the universe ) , @xmath7 ( the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum on a scale of 8@xmath12 comoving mpc ) , and @xmath6 ( the dark energy equation of state ) .",
    "because of the statistical nature of wl surveys , it is important to have an unbiased sample of source galaxies , fairly sampling the foreground density fluctuations across the sky . in this paper",
    ", we investigate possible sources of bias in flux - limited surveys , arising from a preferential selection of source galaxies in patches of the sky with high magnification , as well as by the dilution in the source galaxy surface density in such regions ( known as magnification bias ; hereafter mb ) .",
    "mb has been studied extensively in the past for its impact on galaxy  quasar and galaxy  galaxy correlation functions in 2d @xcite , and in 3d @xcite , and on the statistics of the lyman-@xmath13 forest @xcite . an additional size bias ( hereafter sb )",
    "can be present in surveys in which the selection of the source galaxies depends on their angular sizes .",
    "if not accounted for , these biases represent a systematic error for cosmological measurements . in the context of wl ,",
    "the impact of mb and sb have been studied for the power spectrum @xcite and for high peaks caused by individual nfw halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that ignoring mb and sb in the shear power spectrum can cause @xmath14 deviations in cosmological parameter estimation for a detf  @xcite stage iii experiment , such as the dark energy survey .",
    "future wl surveys with larger sky coverage and/or deeper observations , such as those by planned by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and euclid , will have significantly better statistical sensitivity , and therefore can be more severely impacted by these biases .    in this paper",
    ", we first show that mb is indeed significant for the power spectrum , extending earlier results  @xcite to explicitly compute the biases on cosmological parameters .",
    "we then focus on the impact of mb on peak counts .",
    "lensing peaks were first considered as a cosmological probe in early ray - tracing simulations a decade ago @xcite .",
    "peak counts have received increasing attention in recent years @xcite as a way to access cosmological information from the strong non - gaussianities in the lensing fields . in particular , these studies have shown that the number and height - distribution of peaks have high cosmological sensitivity , and can improve cosmological constraints by a factor of @xmath15two , compared to using the power spectrum alone .",
    "peak counts are a simple and robust statistic , defined by recording local maxima in a 2d shear or convergence ( @xmath16 ) map , smoothed by suitable filters . ref .",
    "@xcite investigated the physical origin of the individual @xmath16 peaks , by tracing their contributing light rays back in time across their n - body simulation boxes .",
    "they found that high peaks ( with amplitudes @xmath17 3.5@xmath18 , where @xmath18 is the r.m.s .",
    "of the convergence  @xmath16 ) are typically created by individual massive halos .",
    "it has been shown that mb increases the signal - to - noise and therefore the total number of such peaks  @xcite . by comparison , low peaks ( @xmath19 )",
    "are typically caused by a combination of ( cosmology - independent ) shape noise and a ( cosmology - dependent ) constellation of 48 lower - mass halos .",
    "these halos have masses of a few @xmath20 , and are offset by @xmath15arcmin from the line of sight to the center of the peak .",
    "the low peaks are especially promising , as they carry the majority of cosmological information , and are relatively insensitive to baryonic cooling that affect the halo cores @xcite .",
    "we therefore extend the earlier results of @xcite for high peaks , where increases in both the peak heights and number of high peaks were seen , to the low peaks , and to explicitly compute the biases on cosmological parameters .    to study the impact of mb",
    ", we build a simple numerical model to derive cosmological parameters ( and their error bars ) using either the power spectrum or peak counts measured in our simulations .",
    "we then apply magnification bias to a set of `` true '' convergence maps ( which faithfully represent the projected dark matter distribution in a fiducial flat @xmath21cdm cosmology ) to create mock `` biased '' maps , mimicking an observed dataset . for each of these `` biased '' datasets ,",
    "we find the best - fit set of the three cosmological parameters ( @xmath22 and @xmath7 ) , using the `` true '' maps for the model fitting .",
    "finally , we quantify the difference between the inferred cosmology and the true fiducial cosmology , as a function of the strength and sign of the magnification and size bias ( determined by the slope of the galaxy luminosity function and the galaxy size distribution ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in   [ mb ] , we introduce the formalism of magnification bias , and discuss its principal ingredient , the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we then describe our computation methods in",
    "  [ methodology ] , including the convergence maps created with our ray - tracing n - body simulations , computing the power spectra and the peak distributions from these maps , determining the cosmology - dependence of these quantities , and finally applying biases to the maps to create mock observations .",
    "we present our main results in   [ results ] , where we fit the mock data , and show that mb and sb will indeed alter the derived cosmological parameters by many @xmath8 . finally , in   [ summary ] , we summarize our conclusions and the implications of this work .",
    "gravitational lensing causes a bias by modulating the apparent surface density of galaxies on the sky , through two competing effects  @xcite .",
    "first , lensing can magnify ( or demagnify ) individual source galaxies in the background , increasing ( or decreasing ) their total flux . in a flux - limited wl surveys ,",
    "some otherwise excluded faint galaxies can therefore make it into ( or drop out of ) the sample because of this ( de)magnification .",
    "second , a similar ( de)magnification applies to the patch of the sky around the galaxy , geometrically diluting ( or enhancing ) the apparent surface density of galaxies in this region .",
    "these two effects counteract each other , and the net bias depends on the slope of the intrinsic ( unlensed ) galaxy luminosity function at the survey flux limit .",
    "in addition to these effects , lensing can increase ( or decrease ) the apparent angular size of spatially resolved individual galaxies .",
    "if either the survey selection , or a derived statistic such as wl shear , depends on the apparent size , then this can introduce an additional size bias .      to quantify the effect of mb , we follow the discussion in appendix a of @xcite . including the effect of lensing on both the flux and on the geometrical surface density",
    ", we have the relation @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the observed ( lensed ) galaxy number density at position @xmath25 , as viewed by the observer , @xmath26 is the intrinsic ( unlensed ) galaxy number density , @xmath27 is the slope of the cumulative number counts evaluated at @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the convergence .",
    "this equation assumes the weak lensing limit ( @xmath30 ) , neglects the correspondingly small difference @xmath31 between lensed and unlensed directions on the sky , and also assumes that galaxy number density fluctuations @xmath32 on the angular scales of interest are small , as well . under these assumptions ,",
    "the above equation is valid to first order in @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . finally , if we assume a survey with a sharp magnitude cut - off at @xmath28 :    @xmath35      the magnitude of mb depends on the galaxy luminosity function through the logarithmic slope @xmath27 .",
    "observed luminosity functions are well described by a schechter function @xcite , @xmath36^{\\alpha+1 } \\\\   & \\times&\\exp \\left [ -10^{-0.4(m - m^{\\star})}\\right ] dm \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the number density of galaxies with magnitude between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a characteristic number density ( in mpc@xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 is a characteristic magnitude .",

    "we note that in order to measure the shape of the galaxies , it is necessary to adopt a brighter magnitude than for the point sources . for surveys",
    "where the magnitude limit was available only for point sources , we adopted a one magnitude brighter value for @xmath28 .",
    "for simplicity , for broad multi - band filters ( r+i+z ) , we have calculated @xmath27 using the central i band .",
    "table  [ tab : relevant s ] shows that surveys with @xmath50 have @xmath51 , assuming a mean redshift @xmath44 . while the effect of mb almost disappears ( @xmath52 ) for galaxies at @xmath53 .",

    "we will show in   [ results ] that mb will significantly affect the power spectrum and the peak counts at this value .",
    ".[tab : relevant s ] magnitude limits and corresponding @xmath27 ( number count slope ) at @xmath44 and 1.0 for current and future wl surveys . for surveys",
    "in which only the point source magnitude limit was available ( marked by a `` * '' ) , we reduced @xmath28 by 1 magnitude to represent an extended source magnitude cut . in the broad multi - band ( r+i+z )",
    ", we calculated @xmath27 for the central i band . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also attempted to use a spline interpolation , using all three data - points for each parameter to describe the cosmology - dependence .",
    "this enables us to utilize all 7 cosmologies simultaneously , but we lose the advantage of the analytical method to obtain the best - fits ( eq .  [ analytical dp ] ) .",
    "we used the numerical method to find the best - fits with spline interpolation , and found mean biases similar to those from linear interpolations .",
    "however , the error ellipses from spline interpolation were considerably smaller , and suspiciously coincident with our simulated range of model parameters .",
    "this is likely due to the spline tails that curve dramatically outside our parameter region , and hence artificially force the fit to stay within our simulated range of model parameters for each map . to solve this issue",
    ", we will need to have a larger grid of simulation parameters , which will also help us understand the dependence of peak counts on cosmology more accurately .",
    "\\(ii ) we used convergence maps only at a single redshift .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the effect of mb depends weakly on @xmath54 . at low redshift",
    ", @xmath27 is mainly dependent on the slope of this power - law tail , and mb will have similar level of impact for all galaxies . for galaxies at higher redshift , @xmath28 , when redshifted to the rest frame of the galaxy , moves closer to the exponential part of the luminosity function , so we expect @xmath27 to increase to a larger value .",
    "a redshift - dependent correction to mb that folds in the correct @xmath54-distribution of high-@xmath54 galaxies will eventually be necessary .",
    "\\(iii ) we ignored all instrumental and measurement errors . in reality , the point spread function ( psf ) deconvolution and the measurement of galaxy shapes accurately is a difficult task , and has received thorough discussions ( e.g.@xcite ) . ref .",
    "@xcite used simulated shear maps with realistic galaxy properties and has taken into account distortions from both the atmosphere and optical errors expected for lsst .",
    "they have shown that , though peak significance is reduced , the addition of these errors does not significantly degrade the cosmological constraints , compared to considering shape noise only . while our basic conclusion , that mb is significant , likely remains valid in the presence of such errors , the detailed modeling of mb will need to incorporate these additional sources of error .",
    "\\(iv ) in this paper , we choose to work with convergence maps , as they are computationally simpler . using galaxies with sizes larger than the psf , the convergence field",
    "can potentially be inferred by combining galaxy size and flux measurements , as lensing modifies these two quantities by different factors of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , in the weak lensing limit @xcite . in current practice ,",
    "reduced shear maps are obtained by measuring the shapes of individual galaxies .",
    "the observer can deduce the aperture mass ( @xmath60 ) , a smoothed form of convergence , by applying a convolution over tangential components of shear @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that both shear and convergence statistics give similar constraints when compared at the same scale , but once again , the impact of lensing bias should be modeled directly on the shear field .",
    "\\(v ) although wl surveys may implement a sharp flux cut , the size bias is likely to be more complicated , with an effective weighting on galaxies that depends monotonically on their size , but in a gradual fashion , rather than a step function . in the idealized case of a sharp size cut ,",
    "our analysis remains applicable , with a suitable re - interpretation of @xmath61 as a stand - in for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the logarithmic slope of the size distribution ( at the size cut ) . in this simplified case ,",
    "the bias induced by the size cut is likely larger than the one induced by the flux cut .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that , for a survey with magnitude cut @xmath64 and size cut @xmath65 , the impact of mb becomes positive and @xmath66 , which is equivalent to our cases with @xmath67 . from fig .",
    "[ err_ells ] , we see the derived parameters remain many @xmath8 away from the true parameters , but in the opposite direction . this demonstrates that size cut is likely to be important , and also that it is necessary in future work to investigate the effects of size bias in more detail .",
    "\\(vi ) we have tested the impact of mb on three parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . when additional cosmological parameters are considered ( e.g. @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , the impact of mb",
    "may be more severe , since a combination involving the new parameters could mimic the mb better . in order to test this , we need to run more n - body simulations with other parameters varying to build a more complete cosmological model .     the derived cosmological parameters and marginalized error for each parameter as a function of the number of bins , using peak counts .",
    "the error sizes have been scaled to lsst s sky coverage of 20,000 deg@xmath72 .",
    "the error sizes tend to decrease with larger number of bins .",
    "the results for @xmath73 bins are unreliable due to the limited number of realizations in our simulation suite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   the derived cosmological parameters and marginalized error for each parameter as a function of the number of bins , using peak counts .",

    "the results for @xmath73 bins are unreliable due to the limited number of realizations in our simulation suite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    \\(vii ) optimizing the number of bins has not been the focus of this work .",
    "however , the choice of the number of bins has an effect on the error sizes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ err_bins ] , for peak counts , the values of derived parameters and marginalized errors only converge at @xmath74 bins .",
    "once the number of bins exceeds this value , we see a roughly constant plateau extending to @xmath73 bins ( beyond which the results become unreliable , due to having too few realizations of maps and the sample covariance matrix becoming singular near 1000 bins ) .",
    "therefore , we chose to use 200 bins in this work .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effect of magnification bias on peak statistics , using convergence maps from ray - tracing n - body simulations . using maps in a suite of simulations",
    ", we can predict the convergence power spectrum or peak count distribution as a function of @xmath22 , and @xmath7 . using this tool",
    ", we found the biases in cosmological parameters , when convergence maps in the fiducial cosmology , modified by magnification bias , were used to find the best - fit cosmology , without taking mb into account in the fits .",
    "near the flux limit of future wl survey , such as lsst , the galaxy number counts have a logarithmic slope of @xmath51 .",
    "this causes a bias in the inferred value of @xmath6 by @xmath75 and of @xmath76 by @xmath77 when using the power spectrum , and by @xmath78 for @xmath6 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 when using peak counts .",
    "these results are scaled to wl observations expected from lsst . however , for recent surveys , such as cosmos and cfhtlens , the deviations are generally negligible ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ) , due to their smaller sky coverage .",
    "we conclude that it is necessary that cosmological simulations consider mb effects , when they are used to match observations .",
    "we have found that @xmath6 inferred from the power spectrum is less impacted by mb , but peak count is a less biased method to infer @xmath9 .",
    "future work on magnification biases should incorporate the many improvements we have emphasized that are necessary , including ( i ) the redshift - dependence of the bias , ( ii ) the impact on shear maps with realistic measurement errors and the peak statistics derived from these maps , ( iii ) more complex biases induced by the size - dependent measurement errors cut on galaxies , and ( iv ) additionally , the potential of using magnification bias and size bias as a signal to tighten the constraints on convergence field @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that lensing biases can be mitigated by combining the power spectrum and the peak counts , which produce biases in very different directions in cosmological parameter space .",
