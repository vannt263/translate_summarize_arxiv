    "small metal particles have long been known to exhibit resonant excitations known as `` particle '' or `` surface '' plasmons .",
    "such particles , if they have dimensions small compared to the wavelength of light , can exhibit sharp optical absorption peaks , which are typically in the near - infrared or the visible .",
    "these absorption peaks play an important role in the optical response of suspensions of metal particles in a dielectric host@xcite , and have been the subject of a large amount of study , both experimental and theoretical .    because of recent advances in sample preparation ,",
    "it has become possible to study _ ordered _ arrays of such particles@xcite . for chains of metallic particles ,",
    "the coupling between the plasmons comes mainly from the electric field produced by the dipole moment of one nanoparticle , which induces dipole moments on the neighboring nanoparticles .",
    "the dispersion relations for both transverse ( @xmath0 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath1 ) plasmonic waves can then be calculated in the so - called quasistatic approximation@xcite , in which the curl of the electric field is neglected .",
    "this approximation is reasonable when the particles are separated by a distance small compared to the wavelength of radiation .",
    "while this approximation neglects some significant coupling between the plasmonic waves and free photons@xcite , it gives satisfactory results over most of the brillouin zone .    in this paper , we first review the dispersion relations of propagating plasmonic waves in a liquid crystalline host , as originally calculated by pike and stroud @xcite .",
    "we also outline an extension of this approach to treat the dispersion relations in the presence of an external magnetic field . for the case of no magnetic field",
    ", we briefly show how the dispersion relations for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves are modified when the metallic chain is immersed in a liquid crystal host .",
    "we consider two types of such hosts : a nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) and a cholesteric liquid crystal ( clc ) .",
    "an nlc is characterized by a uniaxially anisotropic dielectric tensor .",
    "a unit vector parallel to the symmetry axis of this tensor is known as the director .",
    "a clc can be viewed as a nematic in which the director rotates about an axis perpendicular to the plane ( the `` twist axis '' ) with a characteristic pitch angle .",
    "we note that much of the notation and derivations used in this paper follow those originally presented in pike and stroud  @xcite . using a simple approximation outlined below ,",
    "we show that for the nlc case , both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 waves are modified when the director of the liquid crystal is either parallel to or perpendicular to the metallic chain . for the perpendicular case ,",
    "the two @xmath0 branches are split into two non - degenerate linearly polarized branches . for the clc",
    "we show that , while the @xmath0 branches once again split into two non - degenerate branches , the resulting waves are elliptically polarized , and are described by dispersion relations dependent on the characteristic pitch angle .    after this brief discussion",
    ", we outline the extension of the calculations for the clc host to include the effects of an external magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we suggest that such a field may lead to a method of creating a one - way waveguide composed of a linear chain of metallic particles .",
    "proposals for one - way wave guides are extensive , including proposals for one - way waveguides at the interface between two materials @xcite and along chains of ellipsoidal particles arranged in a spiral configuration@xcite .",
    "our proposal for a one - way waveguide differs from these both in the use of a chain of spherical metallic particles and in the possibility of tuning the dispersion relations via an applied magnetic field .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recap the formalism which allows us to approximately calculate the dispersion relations for @xmath1 and @xmath0 waves in the presence of a liquid crystal host . in section iii , we modify the formalism to include an external magnetic field , in section iv we provide numerical examples , and we follow these by a brief concluding discussion in section v.",
    "we consider a chain of identical metal nanoparticles , each a sphere of radius @xmath3 , arranged in a one - dimensional periodic lattice along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the @xmath5 particle is assumed centered at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "let us assume that the quasistatic approximation is valid , that is , the electric field is curl free ; this case is approximately applicable when both the radius of the particles and the distance between them are small compared the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that other corrections to this approximation exists , such as radiative corrections outlined by weber and ford@xcite .",
    "we first consider how the plasmon dispersion relations are modified when the particle chain is immersed in an anisotropic dielectric , under the influence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the host medium has a dielectric tensor ( @xmath8 ) , with principal dielectric constants @xmath9 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . the medium inside the metallic particles is assumed to have a dielectric tensor @xmath11 with principal diagonal components given by @xmath12 and off diagonal elements given by @xmath13 .",

    "as can be seen , both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 dispersion relations are significantly altered when the host is a nematic liquid crystal rather than an isotropic dielectric ; in particular , the widths of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands are changed .",
    "when the director is perpendicular to the chain axis , the two @xmath0 branches are split when the host is an nlc , whereas they are degenerate for an isotropic host , or an nlc host with director parallel to the chain .",
    "next , we turn to the case of a chain of metal particles immersed in a cholesteric liquid cystal .",

    "instead , each of these two branches has a polarization vector which rotates as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we have not attempted to plot this in the figure .",
    "the present calculations and formalism leave out several effects which may be at least quantitatively important . first , in our numerical calculations , but not in the formalism",
    ", we have omitted all dipolar couplings beyond the nearest neighbors .",
    "inclusion of further neighbors will quantitatively alter the dispersion relations in all cases considered , but these effects should not be very large , as is already suggested by the early calculations in brongersma et al@xcite for an isotropic host .",
    "another possible effect will appear when @xmath134 is significantly greater than @xmath135 , namely , the emergence of quadrupolar and higher quasistatic bands which will mix with the dipolar band and change its shape@xcite . even for @xmath136 the plasmon dispersion relations will still be altered by an nlc or clc host in the manner described here .",
    "the present treatment also omits radiative damping which may be important at certain wave vectors and at long wavelengths@xcite .",
    "we have not extended the present approach to include such radiative effects but do expect that they will provide only a quantitative change , and not qualitatively change the effects we have described .    from the point of view of applications ,",
    "the use of a liquid - crystalline host is appealing because liquid crystals are significantly affected by an applied electric field .",
    "for example , the director of an nlc tends to align with the applied electric field .",
    "thus , the dispersion relations of the propagating plasmonic waves could be , in principle , controlled by such an applied electric field .",
    "this control could be quite useful , for example , in developing filters for propagating plasmonic waves .",
    "the application of an external magnetic field along with an external electric field would allow one to tune the frequency range where only one wave direction is allowed to propagate , this has potential applications in optical relay systems , optical filters , and as a filter for backscattering waves .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the dispersion relations for plasmonic waves propagating along a chain of closely spaced nanoparticles of drude metal are strongly affected by external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "when under the influence of only an electric field we find that for both materials , the dispersion relations are affected .",
    "if the host is a uniaxially anisotropic dielectric ( such as an nlc ) , the dispersion relations of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are significantly modified , compared to those of an isotropic host , and if the director axis of the nlc is perpendicular to the chain , the two degenerate transverse branches are split . if the host is a clc , with rotation axis parallel to the chain , we find that the @xmath0 modes are again split into nondegenerate bands , whose dispersion relations now depend on the pitch angle @xmath55 . however , in contrast to the nlc case , the two @xmath0 branches are no longer linearly polarized .",
    "these effects suggest that the propagation of such plasmonic waves can be tuned , by subjecting the liquid crystal to a suitable electric field , so as to change the frequency band where wave propagation can occur , or the polarization of these waves .",
    "this control may be valuable in developing devices using plasmonic waves in future optical circuit design . under the influence of an external magnetic field",
