    "if the dark matter ( dm ) of the universe is made of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) their accumulation inside stars may lead to observable effects that depend on the unknown characteristics of the dark particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dm parameter space can be constrained using this approach , in particular in the case of models of dm particles that do not annihilate in stellar interiors .",
    "a good example is asymmetric dm @xcite , a dm model motivated to explain the similar cosmic abundance of dark and baryonic matter and that naturally predicts a dm mass of the order of the few gev ( see for instance the recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "+ a fraction of the wimps in the galactic halo may scatter with nucleons of the stellar plasma and become gravitationally captured by stars  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this process increases with the stellar density ( among other factors ) , so compact stars can be in principle strongly influenced  @xcite .",
    "the destruction of neutron stars by black hole formation in their interior has been predicted , and limits on the properties of asymmetric dm have been derived using this approach  @xcite .",
    "+ in the case of the sun and solar - type stars , the conduction of dm particles in the stellar interior acts as a new energy transport mechanism , cooling the center of the stars  @xcite .",
    "the impact on the properties of these stars tends to be less significant than for compact stars , but on the other hand the physics of the interior of solar - type stars is much better known and observations are much more precise , in particular with the complementary diagnostic of the solar interior provided by solar neutrino measurements  @xcite and helioseismology  @xcite . + in these proceedings we report the study of the impact of asymmetric dm on stars with masses similar to that of the sun  @xcite , stars embedded in halos of dm with a density equal to that estimated for the solar neighbourhood , @xmath2gev @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we focus on stars whose acoustic oscillations have already been precisely identified",
    ". the characteristics of these stars are shown in table  [ tab - starchars ] .",
    "our approach is motivated mainly by the following reasons : i ) stars with lower masses are more strongly influenced by dm , ii ) stars with a small convective core ( 1.1 - 1.3  m@xmath0 stars ) can have their dominant energy transport mechanisms altered due to dm , and iii ) asteroseismology ( the study of the stellar oscillations ) is a technique sensitive to properties of the stellar cores , where the dm impact occurs .",
