    "over the last decades , the energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions between interaction systems have raised a great deal of interest in relativistic quantum mechanics as well as in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the exact solution of the wave equations ( relativistic or non - relativistic ) are very important since the wave function contains all the necessary information regarding the quantum system under consideration .",
    "analytical methods such as the supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite and the nikiforov - uvarov method ( nu ) @xcite have been used to solve the wave equations exactly or quasi - exactly for non zero angular momentum quantum number ( @xmath3 ) by means of a given potential .",
    "the radial schrdinger equation for the hulthn potential is solved exactly by using several techniques @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "for the case @xmath5 , the effective hulthn potential can not be solved exactly , but a number of methods have been used to find the bound state energy eigenvalues numerically @xcite and quasi - analytically such as the variational @xcite , perturbation @xcite , shifted @xmath2 expansion @xcite , nu @xcite and susy @xcite methods .",
    "the hulthn potential @xcite is one of the important short - range potentials in physics and it potential has been applied to a number of areas such as nuclear and particle physics , atomic physics , condensed matter and chemical physics ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting and important to solve the non - relativistic radial schrdinger equation for this potential for @xmath5 , since it has been extensively used to describe the bound and the continuum states of the interaction systems . recently , an alternative method , called as the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) , has been developed by ifti _",
    "@xcite for solving second - order homogeneous linear differential equations and it has been applied to solve the non - relativistic radial schrdinger equation or the relativistic dirac equation .    in this paper , we aim to solve the hulthn potential to obtain the energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for any @xmath0 states .",
    "in the next section , aim is introduced .",
    "then , in section [ apply1 ] , the schrdinger equation is solved by using aim for the hulthn potential for any @xmath0 states and our aim results are given in comparison with the results of the numerical integration @xcite , the variational @xcite , the shifted @xmath2 expansion @xcite and the susy @xcite methods . finally , section [ conclude ] is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "aim is briefly outlined here and the details can be found in references @xcite .",
    "aim is proposed to solve the second - order differential equations of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the variables , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are sufficiently differentiable .",

    ", the radial schrdinger equation is converted to the form of equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "then , s@xmath19 and @xmath10 are determined and s@xmath20 and @xmath21 parameters are calculated by the recurrence relations given by equation  ( [ iter ] ) .    the termination condition of the method in equation ( [ termination ] ) can be arranged as    @xmath22    the energy eigenvalues are obtained from the roots of the equation ( [ quantization ] ) if the problem is exactly solvable .",
    "if not , for a specific @xmath23 principal quantum number , we choose a suitable @xmath24 point , determined generally as the maximum value of the asymptotic wave function or the minimum value of the potential @xcite , and the approximate energy eigenvalues are obtained from the roots of this equation for sufficiently great values of @xmath12 with iteration .      in this study , we seek the exact solution of the radial schrdinger equation for which the relevant second order homogenous linear differential equation takes the following general form @xcite , @xmath25 if this equation is compared to equation ( [ diff ] ) , it entails the following expressions @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants and @xmath29 can be determined from the condition ( [ termination ] ) for @xmath30 and @xmath31=-1,0,1,2,3 , ... as follows : @xmath32 hence , these formule are easily generalized as , @xmath33 the exact eigenfunctions can be derived from the following generator : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath23 represents the radial quantum number and @xmath12 shows the iteration number . for exactly solvable potentials ,",
    "the radial quantum number @xmath23 is equal to the iteration number @xmath12 and the eigenfunctions are obtained directly from equation ( [ generator1 ] ) . for nontrivial potentials that have no exact solutions ,",
    "@xmath12 is always greater than @xmath23 in these numerical solutions and the approximate energy eigenvalues are obtained from the roots of equation ( [ quantization ] ) for sufficiently great values of @xmath12 with iteration .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath36 given by equation ( [ termination ] ) is equal to zero for the ground state .",
    "therefore , using equation ( [ termination ] ) with ( [ snln ] ) in equation ( [ generator1 ] ) , the eigenfunctions are obtained as follows ,    @xmath37    finally , the following general formula for the exact solutions @xmath38 is obtained as , @xmath39    it is important to note that square integrable one in @xmath40 is this total wave function which is the asymptotic form of the wave function times @xmath38 given by equation ( [ generator1 ] ) . here ,",
    "@xmath41=@xmath42 = @xmath43 @xmath44 = @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 are known as the pochhammer symbol and the gauss hypergeometric function , respectively .",
    "the motion of a particle with the mass @xmath48 in the spherically symmetric potential is described in the spherical coordinates by the following schrdinger equation :    @xmath49+v(r ) \\right)\\psi_{nl m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)=e\\psi_{nl m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\label{sch}\\ ] ]    defining @xmath50 , we obtain the radial part of the schrdinger equation : @xmath51r_{nl}(r)=0 \\label{radialr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is sometimes convenient to define @xmath52 and the effective potential as follows @xmath53 since @xmath54 the radial schrdinger equation @xcite given by equation ( [ radialr ] ) follows that @xmath55u_{nl}(r)=0 \\label{factorschrodinger}\\ ] ]    the hulthn potential @xcite is given by    @xmath56    where z and @xmath57 are respectively the atomic number and the screening parameter , determining the range for the hulthn potential .",
    "the hulthn potential behaves like the coulomb potential near the origin @xmath58 , but in the asymptotic region @xmath59 , the hulthn potential decreases exponentially , so its capacity for bound states is smaller than the coulomb potential .",
    "however , for small values of the screening parameter @xmath57 , the hulthn potential becomes the coulomb potential given by @xmath60 .",
    "the effective hulthn potential is    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is known as the centrifugal term .",
    "this effective potential can not be solved analytically for @xmath5 because of the centrifugal term .",
    "therefore , we must use an approximation for the centrifugal term similar to other authors @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", @xmath63 is used for the centrifugal term . as",
    "shown in figure [ eigenpot ] , this approximation is only valid for small @xmath64 and it breaks down in the high - screening region . for small @xmath64 , @xmath65 is very well approximated to @xmath66 and the schrdinger equation for this approximate potential is solvable analytically .",
    "so , the effective potential becomes    @xmath67    instead of solving the radial schrdinger equation for the effective hulthn potential @xmath66 given by equation ( [ veff ] ) , we now solve the radial schrdinger equation for the new effective potential @xmath65 given by equation ( [ veff1 ] ) . inserting this new effective potential into equation ( [ factorschrodinger ] ) and using the following _ ansatzs _ in order to make the differential equation more compact @xmath68 the radial schrdinger equation takes the following form : @xmath69 u_{nl}(x)=0\\ ] ]",
    "if we rewrite equation ( [ radyal ] ) by using a new variable of the form @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71u_{nl}(z)=0\\ ] ] in order to solve this equation with aim , we should transform this equation to the form of equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "therefore , the reasonable physical wave function we propose is as follows @xmath72 if we insert this wave function into equation ( [ trans ] ) , we have the second - order homogeneous linear differential equations as in the following form @xmath73 \\frac{df_{nl}(z)}{dz}+\\left[\\frac{(2\\varepsilon+l+2)l+2\\varepsilon-\\beta^{2}+1}{z(1-z ) } \\right]f_{nl}(z)\\ ] ] which is now amenable to an aim solution . by comparing this equation with equation ( [ diff ] )",
    ", we can write the @xmath74 and @xmath75 values and by means of equation ( [ iter ] ) , we may calculate @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this gives : @xmath78 combining these results with the quantization condition given by equation ( [ quantization ] ) yields @xmath79 when the above expressions are generalized , the eigenvalues turn out as @xmath80 using equation ( [ ansatz ] ) , we obtain the energy eigenvalues e@xmath81 , @xmath82^{2 } \\hspace{1cm}\\ ] ] in the atomic units @xmath83 and for z = 1 , equation ( [ energyeigenvalues ] ) turns out to be @xmath84^{2 } \\hspace{1cm}\\ ] ]    in order to test the accuracy of equation ( [ eigenvaluesatomic ] ) , we calculate the energy eigenvalues for @xmath85 , any @xmath23 and @xmath0 quantum numbers and several values of the screening parameter .",
    "aim results are compared with the results of the numerical integration @xcite , the variational @xcite , the shifted @xmath2 expansion @xcite and the susy @xcite methods in table [ table1 ] and table [ table2 ] . as it can be seen from the results presented in these tables , the aim results are in good agrement with the results of the other methods for the small @xmath57 values . for large @xmath57 values , there are differences between our results and the results of others .",
    "this difference is due to the @xmath65 potential , which we have used to approximate the @xmath66 potential .",
    "as it is seen from figure [ eigenpot ] , for large @xmath64 values , the discrepancy becomes apparent between our @xmath65 and the true @xmath66 potentials .",
    "this gives rise to the differences for the eigenvalues presented in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] at large @xmath57 values .",
    "now , as indicated in section [ aim ] , we can determine the corresponding wave functions by using equation ( [ efson ] ) .",
    "when we compare equation ( [ compare1 ] ) and equation ( [ aimschr ] ) , we find @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "so , we can easily find the solution for @xmath92 , for the energy eigenvalue equation ( [ energyeigenvalues ] ) by using equation ( [ efson ] ) .",
    "@xmath93 thus , we can write the total radial wave function as below , @xmath94 where @xmath31 is the normalization constant .",
    "we have shown an alternative method to obtain the energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the hulthn potential within the framework of the asymptotic iteration method for any @xmath0 states .",
    "we have calculated the energy eigenvalues for the hulthn potential with @xmath85 and several values of the screening parameter .",
    "the wave functions are physical and energy eigenvalues are in good agreement with the results obtained by other methods . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "aim results have been compared with the results of the numerical integration @xcite , the variational @xcite , the shifted @xmath2 expansion @xcite and the susy @xcite methods in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] . for small @xmath57 values ,",
    "aim results are in good agreement with the results of the other methods , but in the high screening region , the agreement is poor .",
    "the reason is simply that when the @xmath64 increases in the high screening region , the agreement between @xmath66 and @xmath65 potentials decreases as shown in figure [ eigenpot ] . this problem could be solved by making a better approximation of the centrifugal term .",
    "it should be pointed out that the asymptotic iteration method gives the eigenvalues directly by transforming the radial schrdinger equation into a form of @xmath95 = @xmath96 .",
    "the wave functions are easily constructed by iterating the values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the asymptotic iteration method results in exact analytical solutions if there is and provides the closed - forms for the energy eigenvalues as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions . where there is no such a solution , the energy eigenvalues are obtained by using an iterative approach @xcite . as it is presented , aim puts no constraint on the potential parameter values involved and it is easy to implement .",
    "the results are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes .",
