    "signal loss is dominated by ( linear ) `` spreading '' of the electromagnetic field and by absorption occurring at each interaction ( `` bounce '' ) with the walls .",
    "the first simple model we use in this paper neglects absorption effects , and models signal loss from spreading by simply terminating the motion of the ball after it has travelled a certain large distance .",
    "the second model only takes into account signal loss from absorption , and completely neglects spreading ; here the motion is terminated after the ball has bounced a certain number of times .",
    "we remark that the distribution of free path lengths is very well studied in the context of the lorentz gas  here a point particle interacts with hard spherical obstacles , either placed randomly , or regularly on euclidean lattices ; recently quasicrystal configurations have also been studied ( cf . @xcite . )",
