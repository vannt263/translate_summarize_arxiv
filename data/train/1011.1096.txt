    "the decay @xmath0 , which is governed by qcd penguins and has a doubly cabibbo - suppressed tree contribution in the standard model ( sm ) , has a very interesting physics potential for @xmath7-decay experiments at hadron colliders .",

    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and certain hadronic parameters @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this @xmath1-spin strategy with respect to the conventional @xmath8 flavour - symmetry strategies is twofold :    * no additional dynamical assumptions have to be made ( such as the neglect of particular topologies ) , which could be spoiled by large rescattering effects ; * electroweak penguins , which are not invariant under the isospin symmetry because of the different up- and down - quark charges , are automatically included .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed discussion of the status of the extraction of @xmath3 coming from the first measurement of the @xmath0 branching ratio at the tevatron was given , addressing also tests of the @xmath1-spin symmetry .",
    "in the current paper , we have a fresh look at the determination of @xmath3 both in view of updated information on the @xmath0 branching ratio and in view of updated information on the relevant @xmath1-spin - breaking form - factor ratio .",
    "the main focus of this paper , however , is to point out the usefulness of measurements of the @xmath0 channel s effective lifetime @xmath9 and mixing - induced cp asymmetry for probing new physics ( np ) in @xmath4@xmath5 mixing .",
    "this analysis provides target ranges for these observables for improved measurements at the tevatron and the lhcb experiment at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) and complements nicely analyses of cp - violating effects in the angular distributions of the decay products of @xmath10\\phi[\\to k^+k^-]$ ] @xcite . with respect to an analysis of various @xmath0 correlations",
    "performed almost a decade ago @xcite , we now obtain a significantly sharper picture .",
    "the cdf and 0 collaborations have used @xmath6 measurements to obtain the first direct results for the cp - violating @xmath4@xmath5 mixing phase @xmath11 . in the sm",
    "this quantity is fixed in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xcite by @xmath12 but could be enhanced significantly through np effects .",

    "as we will show in the current paper , the @xmath0 channel offers an excellent alternative probe for such effects , thereby nicely complementing the @xmath6 analysis and allowing us also to resolve a twofold discrete ambiguity for the extracted value of @xmath11 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : gam ] , we discuss the picture for @xmath3 arising from the current data . in section  [",
    "sec : lifetime ] , we calculate the effective lifetime @xmath9 and study its correlation with the cp - violating @xmath4@xmath5 mixing phase .",
    "a similar analysis is performed for the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of @xmath0 in section  [ sec : acpmix ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": gam - optimal ] , we discuss and illustrate the optimal determination of @xmath3 using the cp asymmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",

    "if we apply the @xmath1-spin symmetry , we obtain the relations @xcite @xmath25 as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these relations are not affected by factorizable @xmath1-spin - breaking corrections , i.e.  the relevant form factors and decay constants cancel .",
    "this feature holds also for chirally enhanced contributions to the transition amplitudes .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath1-spin symmetry also implies @xmath26 . here ,",
    "however , the corresponding decay constants and form factors do not cancel , so that we obtain the following result in the factorization approximation : @xmath27 using the updated qcd light - cone sum rule calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath28 which is consistent within the errors with the numerical value of @xmath29 obtained previously by the authors of ref .",

    "the @xmath0 decay is now well established and the heavy flavour averaging group ( hfag ) gives the following average for its branching ratio @xcite : @xmath30 which is a combination of measurements by cdf @xcite at the tevatron and by belle @xcite at kekb runs at the @xmath31 resonance . a major source of uncertainty for the branching ratio measurement of any @xmath32 decay is the ratio @xmath33 of fragmentation functions @xmath34 describing the probability that a @xmath35 quark will hadronize as a @xmath36 meson . using a newly proposed strategy @xcite ,",

    "this feature is reflected by the averages appearing in the literature : hfag gives @xmath58 , whereas the particle data group ( pdg ) quote the same central value with a larger error of 0.17 @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the final observable that is offered by the @xmath0 channel is its mixing - induced cp asymmetry , which takes the following form @xcite : @xmath59.\\ ] ] the structure of this expression is very similar to ( [ adg - bskk ] ) , i.e.  the strong phase enters only as @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , we can use the formulae given in the previous section to perform an analysis of @xmath61 that is analogous to that of @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath64 allows us to resolve the twofold ambiguity for the value of @xmath11 resulting from the analyses of @xmath66 . in particular , we can then also distinguish between the sm case with @xmath68 and a np scenario with @xmath69 , both leading to small cp violation in @xmath66 .",

    "@xcite . already with an integrated luminosity of @xmath72 at the 7 tev run of the lhc",
    ", a statistical sensitivity for @xmath64 of 0.11 can be obtained at this experiment @xcite .",

    ", the major application of the @xmath0 decay will be the determination of @xmath3 . the key improvement with respect to the discussion in section  [ sec : gam ] will be made possible by the measurement of both @xmath76 and @xmath64 @xcite ( the expected lhcb statistical sensitivity for @xmath76 is 0.15 for already @xmath72 @xcite ) .",
    "we can then convert the corresponding values into a contour in the @xmath3@xmath77 plane that is theoretically clean , in analogy to the @xmath3@xmath78 contour following from the cp - violating observables of the @xmath39 channel shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , and , in order to guide the eye , we have also included the central value of the contour fixed through @xmath82 and @xmath85 .",

    "we obtain a value of @xmath86 , which is very competitive with other direct determinations of this angle .",
    "moreover , our result is in excellent agreement with the fits for the unitarity triangle , thereby excluding large np effects at the decay amplitude level",
    ".    a particularly interesting first observable of the @xmath0 decay to be measured at lhcb will be its effective lifetime @xmath9 .",
    "we have calculated this observable as a function of the @xmath4@xmath5 mixing phase and arrive at a picture that is remarkably stable both with respect to the current errors of the relevant input quantities and with respect to possible @xmath1-spin - breaking effects .",
    "moreover , we have shown that @xmath9 offers an interesting alternative tool to get evidence for a sizeable np value of @xmath11 , thereby complementing the analyses of cp violation in @xmath6 .",
    "the next newly measured observable to enter the stage should be the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of @xmath0 , which is correlated with @xmath65 in an interesting way .",
    "this correlation is again remarkably stable with respect to the errors of the input quantities and possible @xmath1-spin - breaking corrections . even for moderate values of @xmath11 , @xmath64 deviates significantly from its sm value and therefore provides another sensitive probe for cp - violating np effects in @xmath4@xmath5 mixing .",
    "the measurement of @xmath64 will then also allow us to determine @xmath11 unambiguously and , in particular , to distinguish the sm case with @xmath68 from a np scenario with @xmath87 , both leading to small cp violation in @xmath6 .",
    "finally , once the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath0 is also accurately measured , we can optimize the extraction of the angle @xmath3 of the unitarity triangle , which will be the major application of the @xmath0 , @xmath2 system at lhcb in the long run .",
    "moreover , we can then also perform internal checks of the @xmath1-spin symmetry assumption . the picture following from the current data points towards a stable and favourable situation with respect to possible @xmath1-spin - breaking effects .",
