    "understanding of plasma dynamics is an important and attractive issue in plasma physics .",
    "while research of plasma dynamics on fully ionized plasma has been developed in the past century as well as on weakly ionized plasma , recognition of common feature of dynamics observed in partially ionized plasmas becomes a current topic .",
    "partially ionized plasma is defined as a plasma of intermediate degree of ionization between fully ionized plasma and weakly ionized plasma .",
    "the ionization degree of partially ionized plasma is typically of the order of ten percent , where adequate neutral particles and ions ( and also electrons ) coexist and interact with each other .",
    "interesting phenomena related to plasma dynamics in partially ionized plasmas have been observed ; for example , flow reversal has been observed in the scrape off layer of magnetically confined plasmas,@xcite ion upflow in ionospheric plasma .",
    "spatial dependence of the ionization degree@xcite and the role of neutral particle itself are considered to be keys of these phenomena .",
    "we have observed another phenomenon related to plasma dynamics in a laboratory plasma with partially ionized condition .",
    "the phenomenon is spontaneous formation of a tripolar vortex .",
    "the tripolar vortex consists of an elliptic center vortex and two bean - shaped satellites , which have opposite signs of polarity of rotation to that of the center vortex , and remains stationary in time during the whole discharge period .",
    "recently , tripolar vortices were observed in the ocean ( the bay of biscay ) and in a rotating ordinary fluid to be self - organized from a complex initial condition,@xcite and from a forced initial conditions.@xcite these results suggest that the tripolar vortex is a basic coherent structure in rotating fluids@xcite or fluids subjected to the coriolis force .",
    "a plasma in a magnetic field is equivalent to those fluids because the lorentz force has the same effect as the coriolis force , and hence it might be possible to occur a tripolar vortex in a plasma.@xcite    in this paper , the experimental observation of a tripolar vortex in a magnetized partially ionized plasma is presented .",
    "a remarkable characteristic is that the tripolar vortex always appears with a deep density depression of neutral particles and is confined in its valley .",
    "the flow velocity measurements revealed that each vortex rotates in the anti-@xmath1 direction , suggesting that there exists an effective radial force acting on the ions , which overcomes the radial electric field .",
    "we propose that the charge - exchange collisions between the ions and neutrals may produce the effective force through the net momentum transfer .",
    "when there is a strong inhomogeneity in the neutral density profile and the charge - exchange collision is dominant , a directed momentum of the flow of neutrals is brought into the ions by the charge - exchange collision , producing an effective force through the net momentum transfer .",
    "it is shown that the effective force may dominate the ambipolar electric field and drive the anti-@xmath1 vortical motion of ions . the tripolar vortex observed in the present experiments",
    "is considered to be a neutral - induced tripolar vortex .",
    "the existence of neutral particles usually causes a dissipative effect , in which a dissipative instability@xcite and a modification of the mode pattern take place.@xcite it is worth pointing out that the existence of neutral particles may change the ion dynamics qualitatively . in sec .",

    "the detailed structure of the dlp and its validity for measuring the ion flow velocity is given in ref .",
    "the flow velocity component at a certain angle @xmath11 with respect to the reference axis , @xmath12 , is obtained by measuring two ion saturation currents , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and by using the following relation:@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath11 is the angle between the normal of electrode of the dlp and the reference axis , and @xmath16 is the ion sound speed .",

    "as seen in the figure , the peak position of the potential ( @xmath54 ) coincides with that of ion density , and its profile is convex around the density peak , and concave near the center axis .",
    "this means that the expected @xmath1 rotations due to this potential profile are counterclockwise for the satellite vortices , and clockwise for the core vortex , which are apparently opposite to the experimental observations .",
