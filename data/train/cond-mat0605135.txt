    "the effect of inelastic losses on fast electrons has long been of theoretical and experimental interest @xcite , and continues to be an area of active development @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of such losses depend on the dielectric response of a material over a broad spectrum .",
    "moreover , calculations of losses at low energies are particularly sensitive to the excitation spectrum of a material .",
    "while first - principles approaches have been developed for calculations of losses at low energies , i.e. , up to a few tens of ev @xcite , these methods are computationally intensive and may be difficult to implement .",
    "thus detailed calculations of inelastic losses have generally been limited to semi - empirical approaches @xcite , based on experimental optical data . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental data over a sufficiently broad spectrum are not readily available for many materials of interest .    in an effort to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we present here a first - principles , real - space approach for general calculations of inelastic losses .",
    "the approach is applicable to both periodic and aperiodic condensed matter systems throughout the periodic table .",
    "our calculations are based on _ ab initio _ calculations of the complex dielectric function @xmath0 in the long - wavelength limit , together with extensions to finite momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xmath1 are carried out using an all electron , real - space green s function ( rsgf ) formalism as implemented in a generalization of the feff8 code @xcite for full - spectrum calculations of optical constants .",
    "we focus in this paper on several physical quantities which characterize the inelastic interactions of a fast probe electron , a photo - electron , or other charged particle in condensed matter .",
    "these include the inelastic mean - free - path ( imfp ) and the collision stopping - power ( csp ) .",
    "each of these quantities depends on the complex dielectric function @xmath1 through the loss function for a given material @xmath2 = \\epsilon_2(\\omega)/[\\epsilon_1(\\omega)^2+\\epsilon_2(\\omega)^2]$ ] , which is calculated here up to x - ray energies",
    ". the loss function is directly related to the optical oscillator strength ( oos ) . from the oos we obtain values of the mean excitation energy @xmath3 which characterizes the distribution of excitations ( e.g. , plasmons , particle - hole excitations , etc . ) .",
    "recently a comprehensive relativistic treatment of inelastic losses and scattering within the first born approximation has been developed by fernndez - varea _",
    "et al . _",
    "their semi - empirical approach requires experimental optical data as input , and is referred to here as the optical data model ( odm ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage that calculations of quantities such as the csp are reduced to a single quadrature . to facilitate precise comparisons ,",
    "we have used their formulation for our csp calculations , except for the substitution of our _ ab initio _ dielectric function .",
    "our approach is therefore referred to as the  _ ab initio _ data model \" ( adm ) .",
    "we have also compared imfps calculated using both the adm and a one - particle _ self - energy _ approach .",
    "formally the imfp and the csp are related to energy moments of the differential cross - section ( dcs ) for inelastic collisions @xmath4/@xmath5 of a fast probe electron ( or other charged particle ) of initial kinetic energy @xmath6 with energy loss @xmath7 .",

    "we consider cubic materials which we approximate as isotropic , i.e. , in which the dielectric function depends only on the magnitude of the momentum transfer @xmath20 .",
