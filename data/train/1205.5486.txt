    "determining the mechanism that heats the solar upper atmosphere is one of the central goals in observing the solar corona .",
    "coronal heating theories predict short bursts of energy @xcite ; these energy releases are often called `` nanoflares , '' though they are not necessarily caused by small - scale magnetic reconnection events ( i.e. parker s nanoflares ; @xcite ) . one interpretation of this type of heating has been discussed in a series of papers by cargill and klimchuk @xcite .",
    "they describe nanoflare heating as a single short - lived heating event that occurs _ infrequently _ on an elemental strand in the corona ; the density and temperature of the plasma associated with the strand then evolve without any additional heating events .",
    "( we adopt the definition of `` strand '' as a fundamental flux tube in the corona and `` loop '' as an observed coronal structure .",
    "a loop may be formed of a single strand , which would imply the corona is being resolved , or many , sub - resolution strands . )",
    "the evolution and other properties of warm euv loops have been shown to be consistent with the cargill and klimchuk nanoflare model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these loops ,",
    "the nanoflares occur within a narrow heating envelope ( a so - called `` short nanoflare storm , '' @xcite ) on a few sub - resolution strands , then the strands , and apparent loop , evolve .    in the core of active regions , however , the average apex intensity @xcite , footpoint intensity @xcite , and doppler and non - thermal velocities @xcite are often found to be steady ( with variations of @xmath0% ) over several hours of observation , prompting some to suggest that the heating in active region cores is effectively steady , i.e. , heating events occur _ frequently _ on a single strand in the corona @xcite .",
    "@xcite has instead suggested that these loops are heated by `` long nanoflare storms '' , i.e. the loops are bundles of many strands and each strand is heated at a different time . after a single heating event",
    ", the plasma along the strand is allowed to cool completely with no additional heating events on the strand . at any given time in a loop s evolution ,",
    "it is composed of strands in all the different stages of the heating and cooling cycle so the dynamic properties of the plasma are `` averaged out '' in the observed loop . for this heating scenario ,",
    "the observed loops would have some of the same properties as a frequently heated loop , such as steady intensity and velocity .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to test whether the emission measure distribution predicted by the long nanoflare storm model is consistent with the observed emission measure distributions in active region cores .",
    "we first calculate the expected temperature and density evolution for nine representative strands with a range of lengths and heating rates typical to active region cores using a one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "we complete the simulations twice , once with a radiative loss function consistent with photospheric abundances and once with a radiative loss function consistent with coronal abundances .",
    "we then predict the expected emission measure distribution of the loop by assuming the loop is composed of a bundle of strands that are each in a slightly different stage of the temperature and plasma evolution ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "we characterize the `` cool '' ( 6.0 @xmath1 log t @xmath1 log t@xmath2 ) emission measure distribution of each loop by assuming it can be represented by @xmath3 and finding @xmath4 .    for the photospheric radiative loss function , we find @xmath5 for all simulated loops . for the coronal radiative loss function , we find @xmath6 for all simulated loops .",
    "finally , we sum the emission measure distributions for all loops to approximate a potential emission measure distribution of an active region core where many loops may be along the line - of - sight .",
    "we find the summed distributions have @xmath7 for photospheric abundances and @xmath8 for coronal abundances .",
    "we compare these results to two recent analyses of active region cores , which had @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the long nanoflare storm scenario predicts @xmath10 times more 1mk emission than is actually observed in the core of these active regions .",
    "the long nanoflare storm also predicts more high temperature ( @xmath11mk ) emission than observed , but the observations are not well constrained at those temperatures @xcite . through this research",
    ", we have determined that the expected index , @xmath4 , is sensitive to the abundances in the active region cores , with coronal abundances predicting larger values of @xmath4 than photospheric abundances .",
    "we hypothesize that if the abundances in the active region core were `` super - coronal '' the long nanoflare storm simulation could reproduce the observed emission measure distribution .",
    "in this section , we discuss the one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of nine representative strands .",
    "we consider three half - lengths ( excluding the model chromosphere ) of 25 mm , 50 mm and 100 mm .",
    "we assume the strands are semi - circular , perpendicular to the solar surface , and symmetric ( only the half loop solution is solved ) .",
    "we parameterize the spatial and temporal dependence of the energy deposition as @xmath12 where @xmath13 designates the location of the peak of the heating function , @xmath14 is the spatial width of the heating function , and @xmath15 determines the maximum amplitude of the heating function . because symmetry is assumed , there will be two heating locations , one along each loop leg .",
    "the function g(t ) is chosen to be a simple triangular pulse , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the duration of the impulsive heating .",
    "the uniform background heating , @xmath18 , consistent with @xmath19mk , is always applied , so the density and temperature will eventually return to a steady - state equilibrium .    in our simulations , the duration ( @xmath20s ) , width ( @xmath21 mm ) , and heating location",
    "( @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the half - length ) of the impulsive heating function is the same for each simulation .",
    "we vary the magnitude of the heating , @xmath24 , to achieve a specific equilibrium temperature ( see @xcite ) of 4 , 5 , or 6mk based on the photospheric radiative loss function .",
    "the equilibrium temperature in an impulsive heating solution is the temperature at which the density , temperature , and loop length all agree with steady - state conditions .",
    "it is approximately the temperature at which the cooling switches from being dominated by conduction to being dominated by radiation .",
    "this is also approximately when the density of the solution peaks .",
    "the values of @xmath15 are given in column 3 of table  [ tab : simulation ] .",
    "these same heating magnitudes are applied to the simulations using coronal abundances .    for each of the lengths , equilibrium temperatures , and radiative loss functions ( 18 individual simulations ) , we solve the hydrodynamic loop equations with the naval research laboratory solar flux tube model ( nrl_solftm ) .",
    "we adopt many of the same assumptions that were used in previous simulations with this code , and we refer the reader to earlier papers for additional details of this numerical code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative loss functions used in the simulations are based on the atomic physics calculations with ionization equilibrium described by @xcite and the abundances of @xcite for photospheric abundances and @xcite for coronal abundances .",
    "we compute average temperature and density evolution by averaging over the top 50% of the coronal part of the strand where @xmath25k . as an example",
    ", the evolution of the 25 mm half - length strand with a heating magnitude , @xmath15 , of 7.5 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 is shown in figure  [ fig : tn ] .",
    "this example has an equilibrium temperature of 4mk .",
    "the left panel shows the average temperature as a function of time and the right panel shows the average density as a function of time for both photospheric and coronal abundances . as the nanoflare is turned on , the average temperature rises rapidly .",
    "similarly , the density begins to increase as chromospheric material fills the strand .",
    "as the heating event ends , first the temperature and then the density begin to decrease .",
    "the peak density is higher and the cooling time longer for the photospheric solution compared to the coronal solution .    above we",
    "have described how the temperature and density evolution of representative strands were calculated . here",
    "we discuss the method to combine these strands to determine properties of both individual loops and an active region core .",
    "first we assume that a loop is formed of many strands , with a single strand in each stage of the temperature and density evolution , similar to @xcite . in practical terms , this assumption implies a loop contains one strand for each time step of the simulation .",
    "for instance , in the photospheric solution shown in figure  [ fig : tn ] , the strand evolves for 2100s before returning to equilibrium conditions .",
    "the code writes the solution every 10s .",
    "the consequent loop , then , is formed of 210 strands , with each strand having an average temperature and density associated with a specific time step of the simulation .",
    "the emission measure distribution of the loop is then determined by sorting the emission measures of the contributing strands into temperature bins .",
    "the emission measure for each strand is calculated from @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average electron density of the strand and @xmath30 is the depth of the strand ; this emission measure is placed in the bin containing the average temperature of the strand at that time step .",
    "the resulting emission measure distributions for each loop length , equilibrium temperature , and radiative loss assumptions are shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] .",
    "the dotted vertical lines in figure [ fig : dem ] mark the temperatures corresponding to the peak of the emission measure distributions ; these peak temperatures are listed in table  [ tab : simulation ] . for each length and equilibrium temperature ,",
    "the photospheric solutions are shown in blue and the coronal solutions are shown in red .",
    "we scale the emission measure distributions so that the peak in the em curve is @xmath31@xmath32 .    from log t = 6.0 to the temperature of the peak of the emission measure distribution",
    ", the emission measure distribution can be approximated as @xmath3 .",
    "we determine @xmath4 by fitting the log of the emission measure distribution as a function of log of temperature with a linear regression routine .",
    "these fits are shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] and the values of @xmath4 are given in table  [ tab : simulation ] .",
    "for photospheric abundances , @xmath4 ranges from 1.6 to 2.0 and for coronal abundances",
    "@xmath4 range from 2.0 to 2.3 .",
    "in general , longer , hotter strands have larger @xmath4s .",
    "the coronal solutions have larger values of @xmath4 than the photospheric solutions .    in the core of an active region , many loops are along the line - of - sight . to approximate the emission measure distribution for an active region core , we simply sum the emission measure distributions for either the photospheric or coronal abundances for all loops shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] ; these emission measure distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : sum ] .",
    "we have normalized the emission measure distributions to @xmath33 @xmath32 for ease of comparison .",
    "we also compute the @xmath4 for the summed solutions and we find @xmath7 for photospheric abundances and @xmath8 for coronal abundances .",
    "these @xmath4 represent an emission measure weighted average @xmath4 of the individual loops .",
    "this implies that when an active region core is formed of many loops , the emission measure distribution of the core can never have an @xmath4 smaller or larger than the minimum and maximum @xmath4 for each constituent loop . for comparison ,",
    "we show two emission measure distributions from observations ; we discuss these in detail in the following section .",
