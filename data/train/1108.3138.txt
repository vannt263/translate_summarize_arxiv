    "the aim of this paper is to draw attention to the possibility of resolving several problems of dynamo theory for solar activity by combining diamagnetic turbulent pumping and a nonlocal @xmath0-effect in a solar dynamo model .    in the absence of reliable data on magnetic fields in the deep solar interior , modeling the solar dynamo",
    "remains a controversial issue ( for a recent review , see ) .",
    "consensus has developed that the dynamo is driven by two basic effects .",
    "the @xmath4-effect of nonuniform rotation produces a strong toroidal field from a poloidal one and the @xmath0-effect of cyclonic motion @xcite regenerates the poloidal field .",
    "already the first models of an @xmath5-dynamo produced oscillatory solutions resembling the solar cycle @xcite . if discrepancies between computed and observed parameters within two orders of magnitude are tolerable , these pioneering models are quite satisfactory .",
    "a closer agreement is difficult and may even seem impossible to obtain in view of the basic physics of the dynamo process and decades - long practice of dynamo simulations",
    ".    already noticed that turbulent magnetic diffusivity should be reduced much below the standard mixing - length value of @xmath6@xmath2s@xmath3 in order to reproduce the observed period of the solar cycle .",
    "the time of diffusive decay of a magnetic field can be estimated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the depth of the convection zone .",
    "a cyclic dynamo has to regenerate fields in a shorter time in order to overpower the diffusive decay , so that @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the period of the magnetic cycle ) .",
    "the observed period can be reproduced with a diffusivity value much smaller than @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 , this case , however , is difficult to justify . eddy viscosity or thermal diffusivity below @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 can not be a correct parameterization for solar convection because with such small eddy diffusion the external layers of the sun are still unstable @xcite .",
    "the assumption of small magnetic diffusion needs to explain why the same turbulent mixing transports momentum and heat much more efficiently than a magnetic field .",
    "theories of turbulent transport coefficients do not support the assumption of large magnetic prandtl number .",
    "direct numerical simulations of also give this number of the order of unity .",
    "observations show a clear predominance of the equator - antisymmetric ( dipolar ) component in the global magnetic field of the sun @xcite .",
    "the symmetric part is relatively small and does not show an 11-year cycle .",
    "the critical dynamo numbers for the excitation of the global modes of these two types of symmetry are usually very close together .",
    "the threshold dynamo number for the antisymmetric modes may be relatively small , leading to the preference for this type of symmetry , but the situation can usually be changed to the preference for the symmetric modes by small variations of parameters in a dynamo model . in other words ,",
    "the equatorial symmetry is unstable to small changes in the design of dynamo models .",
    "another problem is related to the ratio of toroidal- to poloidal - field amplitudes .",
    "the ratio is not smaller than a thousand if the poloidal field is estimated by its polar value and the toroidal field - by the field strength in sunspots .",
    "solar differential rotation of about 30% can produce in the 11 years of the solar cycle a toroidal field that is at most 40 times stronger than the poloidal filed .",
    "strong radial gradient of rotation in the tachocline does not change this estimation because the radial field should be as much weaker there compared to the meridional field as the radial shear is larger than the latitudinal shear ( except for in cases of the relic field penetrating from the radiation zone , or the field having a structure with multiple latitudinal belts , both cases present new problems ) .",
    "another problem of the so - called catastrophic quenching of the @xmath0-effect ( gruzinov and diamond , 1994 ; ) is not directly related to observations but is internal for theory .",
    "it can be outlined as follows .",
    "the large - scale fields generated by @xmath0-effect dynamos are helical . as the magnetic helicity is conserved , small - scale magnetic fields attain helicity equal in amount and opposite in sign to that of large - scale fields .",
    "helical small - scale fields produce their own magnetic @xmath0-effect that counteracts the @xmath0-effect of whatever origin so that the total @xmath0-effect strongly diminishes .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that the catastrophic quenching is alleviated in a solar dynamo model that combines a nonlocal @xmath0-effect and diamagnetic pumping of large - scale fields by turbulent convection . in this new publication",
    "it is shown that with this model other above - mentioned problems also fade .",
    "the diamagnetic pumping , which will be discussed in the next section , concentrates the magnetic field at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the turbulent diffusion in this region is small . as a result",
    ", the solar cycle period can be reproduced .",
    "the poloidal field in the near - base region is much stronger than on the surface and sufficiently strong for the differential rotation to generate kilogauss toroidal fields over a solar cycle .",
    "the critical dynamo number for dipolar dynamo modes is considerably smaller compared to quadrupolar modes , so that the model always results in a global field of dipolar parity .",
    "however , the model still has difficulties in reproducing time - latitude diagrams of solar magnetism .",
    "we include the meridional flow and vary the latitudinal profile of the @xmath0-effect to reproduce observational butterfly diagrams .",
    "diamagnetic pumping of large - scale fields was predicted theoretically long time ago @xcite but is scarcely known in the dynamo community and is usually ignored in dynamo models ( see , however , rdiger and brandenburg , 1995 ; ; guerrero and de gouveia dal pino , 2008 ) .",
    "the nature of diamagnetic pumping is well illustrated by the case of inhomogeneous 2d turbulence with the fluctuating velocity @xmath11 uniform along a direction defined , say , by the unit vector @xmath12 and inhomogeneous in the direction perpendicular to @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for this case , found that the mean electromotive force , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is a fluctuating magnetic field ) , can be written as @xmath17 if the large - scale field @xmath18 is also perpendicular to @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "this means that the large - scale field is transported with the effective velocity @xmath21 the diamagnetic pumping expels the field from the regions of relatively high turbulence intensity .",
    "however , for the case of the mean field parallel to the direction @xmath19 , the mean electromotive force reads @xmath22 and there is no diamagnetic pumping .",
    "the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath12-direction , @xmath23 , behaves like a scalar field .",
    "the diamagnetic pumping , therefore , is related to the vectorial nature of magnetic fields , and there is no counterpart of diamagnetic pumping for scalar fields .",
    "the pumping effect can be interpreted as follows ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "imagine that there is a background field perpendicular to both the direction @xmath19 and the gradient of turbulence intensity .",
    "if the turbulent motion displaces a flux tube of such a field as the one on the left in figure  [ f1 ] , _ i.e. _ , in the direction of decreasing turbulence intensity , the left boundary of the tube is on average moving slower than the right boundary .",
    "the tube is compressed , and the field strength in the displaced region increases .",
    "similarly , displacement to the right decreases the field strength in the displaced region .",
    "turbulent mixing produces on average the field transport in the direction of decreasing turbulent intensity , _",
    "i.e. _ , turbulent conducting fluids behave diamagnetic .    in the 3d case ,",
    "the expression for the effective velocity of diamagnetic transport changes to @xcite @xmath24 the diamagnetic pumping can be very efficient near the bottom of the convection zone where the intensity of turbulent convection changes sharply with depth @xcite .",
    "doubts have been expressed concerning the efficiency of the pumping in a nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "however , turbulent diamagnetism was recently detected in laboratory experiments with liquid sodium @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations also show downward pumping of large - scale fields near the base of convectively unstable layers ( tobias _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; ; zigler and rdiger , 2003 ) .",
    "whether the simulations indeed show the turbulent diamagnetism is not perfectly clear . their results were interpreted in terms of the drobyshevski and yuferev ( 1974 ) effect of topological pumping (; dorch and nordlund , 2001 ) .",
    "anyway , the diamagnetic and topological pumpings are of the same sense ( downward ) near the base of the convection zone .",
    "we apply the equation([4 ] ) for the effective transport velocity in our dynamo model .",
    "it may be noted that turbulent diffusion and pumping are both reduced by rotation and/or a magnetic field . and observed the rotational quenching effect in numerical simulations .",
    "an analytical theory of turbulent transport predicts that though the turbulent diffusion and pumping are modified , the relation ( [ 4 ] ) between their isotropic parts survives under the influence of rotation or a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "our dynamo model is based on the mean - field induction equation @xmath25 the large - scale flow is a superposition of rotation and meridional circulation , @xmath26 where the usual spherical coordinates are used , @xmath4 is the characteristic value of angular velocity , @xmath27 is the normalized frequency of differential rotation , @xmath28 is the meridional flow stream function , @xmath29 is density , and @xmath30 is the azimuthal unit vector .    the mean electromotive force is written as @xmath31 where the first term on the right stands for both turbulent diffusion and the diamagnetic pumping of equation([4 ] ) .",
    "the second term accounts for the @xmath0-effect in its nonlocal formulation @xcite @xmath32 the local @xmath0-effect is subject to the catastrophic quenching mechanism ( brandenburg and subramanian , 2005 ) while the nonlocal @xmath0-effect is not ( kitchatinov and olemskoy , 2011a ) , and for this reason it may be dominating in the dynamo process . another possibility to avoid the catastrophic quenching is to invoke sufficiently efficient fluxes of magnetic helicity ( guerrero , chatterjee , and brandenburg , 2010 ) .",
    "similar to the mean flow of equation([6 ] ) , the magnetic field can be written as a superposition of its toroidal and poloidal parts , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the poloidal field potential .    here",
    "we introduce normalized variables . the time is measured in units of @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the characteristic value of the eddy diffusivity .",

    "the normalized equation for the toroidal field reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dynamo number and @xmath47 is the magnetic reynolds number for the meridional flow .",
    "the @xmath5-approximation is applied to neglect the alpha - effect in the toroidal field equation ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this equation describes the toroidal - field production by differential rotation , its advection by the meridional flow , diamagnetic pumping , and turbulent diffusion .",
    "the poloidal - field equation with nonlocal @xmath0-effect is written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the radius of the inner boundary .",
    "the integration in this equation is only in the radius with the upper limit @xmath50 .",
    "this qualitatively reflects the fact that the nonlocal @xmath0-effect at some point @xmath50 is contributed by the buoyant magnetic loops rising from deeper layers ( @xmath51 ) and that buoyant velocities are almost vertical .",
    "our dynamo equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) are very similar to those in our previous publication @xcite , but now we include meridional flow and neglect the ( local ) magnetic @xmath0-effect which was shown to be insignificant when nonlocal @xmath0-effect is allowed for .",
    "our boundary conditions assume a perfect conductor beneath the inner boundary of radius @xmath49 and pseudo - vacuum conditions on the top , @xmath52 the bottom boundary in our model is at @xmath53 .    the initial - value problem for the dynamo equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) was solved numerically by the grid - point method and explicit time - stepping .",

    "was prescribed as follows , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the error function and @xmath61 in the denominator of the first equation accounts for the usual algebraic quenching of the @xmath0-effect .",

    "<S> a combination of diamagnetic pumping and a nonlocal @xmath0-effect of the babcock - leighton type in a solar dynamo model helps to reproduce observations of solar magnetic activity . </S>",

    "<S> the simulated global fields are antisymmetric about the equator and the toroidal - to - poloidal field ratio is about a thousand . </S>",
    "<S> the time - latitude diagrams of magnetic fields in the model without meridional flow , however , differ from observations . only when the meridional flow is included and the @xmath0-effect profile peaking at mid latitudes is applied , can the observational butterfly diagrams be reproduced . </S>"
