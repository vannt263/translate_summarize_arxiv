    "an accurate description of the inner crust , assuming that it is a perfect crystal , should rely on the band theory of solids  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we briefly review this theory in the context of neutron star crust and discuss the w - s approximation in this framework .      according to the floquet - bloch theorem ,",
    "the single particle quantum states are given by modulated plane waves @xmath7 where the functions @xmath8 have the full periodicity of the lattice .",
    "each single particle quantum state is thus labeled by a discrete index @xmath9 and by a wave vector @xmath10 .",
    "the energy spectrum is therefore formed of a series of sheets or `` bands '' in @xmath10-space .",
    "the bloch states ( [ bloch_states ] ) are completely determined by the knowledge of the functions @xmath8 inside a w - s cell of the lattice , whose shape is imposed by the symmetry of the crystal .",
    "the cell , centered around one nuclear cluster , is electrically neutral and therefore contains as many electrons as protons .",
    "the effects of the ion lattice on the electrons , which give rise to complicated band structures in ordinary terrestrial matter are negligible in the inner crust of a neutron star due to the very high densities  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the neutron band effects due to nuclear inhomogeneities can not be ignored .    in the present study , we consider the outermost layers of the inner crust where pairing effects are negligible  @xcite . in the hartree - fock approximation with skyrme forces which we shall consider in the following , the occupied nucleon single particle wave functions are obtained by solving the self - consistent equations ( @xmath11 for neutrons and protons respectively ) @xmath12 where the single particle hamiltonian is defined by @xmath13 the effective masses @xmath14 , mean fields @xmath15 and spin - orbit terms @xmath16 being functionals of the single particle wave functions .",
    "these equations have to be solved inside the w - s cell with the boundary conditions imposed by the floquet - bloch theorem @xmath17 where @xmath18 is any lattice vector .",
    "this means in particular that the wavefunction between two opposite faces of the cell has a phase shift @xmath19 where @xmath18 is the corresponding lattice vector .",
    "the single particle energies are periodic in the reciprocal lattice whose vectors @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is any integer ) @xmath23 consequently only the values of @xmath10 inside the first brillouin zone ( _ i.e. _ w - s cell of the reciprocal lattice ) are relevant .",
    "equivalently , equations ( [ hf ] ) can be written directly for the @xmath24 functions in the decomposition ( [ bloch_states ] ) which leads to @xmath25 where the @xmath10-dependent hamiltonian @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 and the velocity operator @xmath28 is defined by the commutator @xmath29   \\ , .\\ ] ]    the band theory takes into account all the symmetries of the system",
    ". however equations ( [ hf ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bloch_boundary ] ) are numerically very complicated to solve .",
    "the approximation introduced a long time ago by wigner and seitz in the study of metallic sodium  @xcite has been widely applied in the context of neutron star crust , as described below .",
    "the spherical w - s approximation is a computationally very efficient method with the advantage of reducing the 3d partial differential eqs .",
    "( [ hf ] ) to ordinary differential radial equations .",
    "this approximation is twofold .",
    "first of all , the hamiltonian @xmath26 in equation ( [ red_hf ] ) is neglected .",
    "consequently the wave functions and the energies are independent of @xmath10 and approximated by the solutions at @xmath30 .",
    "only the band index @xmath9 remains .",
    "secondly , the w - s polyhedron is replaced by a sphere of equal volume .",
    "the equations are then usually solved with the dirichlet - neumann mixed boundary conditions which yield a nearly constant neutron density outside the cluster .",
    "the w - s approximation turns out to be very good if the boundary conditions play a minor role .",
    "for instance , bound states whose associated wave functions are vanishingly small outside the clusters are very well treated provided that the spatial extent of these states is smaller than the lattice spacing .",
    "this condition is fulfilled almost everywhere in the crust except in the bottom layers where the clusters nearly touch .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the validity of the w - s approximation for the outermost layers of the inner crust where the bound neutron states are not altered by the boundary conditions .",
    "let us emphasize that in the w - s approximation , the nuclear clusters are supposed to be spherical while in the full band theory , no assumption is made about their shape .",
    "for the low densities of interest in this study , the nuclear clusters can still be considered as spherical .",
    "it should mentioned that in a recent development of the w - s approximation  @xcite , the w - s cell is replaced by a cube with strictly periodic boundary conditions .",
    "possible deformations of the nuclear clusters are thus included but at the price of unphysical boundary conditions because the w - s cell of the body centered cubic lattice is a truncated octahedron and not a cube ( the cube being the w - s cell of the simple cubic lattice ) .",
    "this is the reason why we still consider the spherical w - s approximation closer to the physical situation than the cubic one at low density .",
    "the comparison between the band theory and the w - s approximation gives an estimate of the contribution ( [ hk ] ) of the @xmath31-dependent hamiltonian @xmath32 and incidentally on the effects of the boundary conditions .",
    "we have considered the shallow layers of the crust at the average baryon density @xmath33 g/@xmath34 formed of a crystal made of zirconium like clusters ( @xmath35 ) with @xmath36 neutrons ( bound and unbound ) per lattice site@xcite . in the following we shall refer to such cluster as @xmath0zr . under such conditions , only unbound neutrons are sensitive to the boundary conditions and the nuclear clusters are spherical .    for the comparison",
    ", we first solve the self - consistent hartree - fock equations in coordinate space , considering the w - s approximation .",
    "the effective force used is the same as in references  @xcite , namely the skyrme interaction sly4  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] , we show the neutron and proton densities calculated in the spherical w - s cell with @xmath0zr .",
    "the size of the box is @xmath37 fm .",
    "the cell exhibits a very large and diffuse neutron skin , which is typical of those systems  @xcite .",
    "a small but non - zero neutron density is present at large radius generating a non - zero mean field potential .",
    "asymptotically , this potential is equal to -0.05 mev .",
    "all the states with energy larger than -0.05 mev are therefore unbound or `` free '' .",
    "we found that among the 160 neutrons per lattice site , 70 are unbound .",
    "the effective mass @xmath38 and the mean field potential @xmath39 obtained for the spherical cell are used to construct an effective schrdinger equation for band theory calculations . as the spin - orbit splitting is weak for most of the states",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , we set the spin - orbit potential @xmath40 to zero . in order to study the effects of the boundary conditions ,",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved with no further iterations by imposing the bloch boundary conditions  ( [ bloch_boundary ] ) and using the linearized augmented plane wave method ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the coordinate space is divided in two regions : a spherical region around the cluster plus an interstitial region . in the latter region , the wave functions are expanded on a plane wave basis in order to fulfill the bloch boundary conditions . the lattice spacing is determined by requiring that the volume of the w - s sphere is equal to the volume of the exact w - s cell of the crystal , assumed to be a body centered cubic lattice@xcite .    in the following , we compare the single particle wave functions and energy spectra of the unbound neutrons .      as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ ws_app ] , the wave functions of the bound states are nearly independent of the boundary conditions . as a consequence , we expect that the band theory and the w - s approximation provide identical bound states .",
    "since the unbound states are orthogonal to the bound states , the w - s approximation and the band theory are expected to yield similar unbound wavefunctions inside the nuclear clusters .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculation of the density distribution of the unbound neutrons ( whose single particle energies exceed @xmath41 mev as discussed previously ) shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : densf ] , obtained with the band theory and the w - s approximation . for the comparison",
    ", the density @xmath42 obtained from the band theory , has been averaged over the solid angle around one lattice site as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radial distance from the lattice site .",
    "similar density oscillations are obtained in both calculations in the vicinity of the nuclear cluster for @xmath45 fm as expected .",
    "qualitative differences in the neutron density are however observed in the interstitial regions outside clusters due to different boundary conditions .",
    "the unbound neutron density distribution is nearly flat in the band theory while it is more fluctuating in the w - s approximation .",
    "the bloch wavefunctions outside the clusters are similar to plane waves ( thus giving a constant density ) which can not be properly described in the w - s approximation owing to the expansion of the wavefunctions into only a few spherical harmonics .",
    "an analysis of the contribution of each single particle wave function to the unbound neutron density in the w - s approximation reveals that the oscillations at small radius are mainly coming from p - states , such as 3p@xmath46 or 3p@xmath47 whereas at larger radii ( @xmath48 fm ) only a few larger @xmath49 states , mainly d - f - g - h states , are contributing to the free neutron density .    as a result ,",
    "the w - s approximation predicts a different number of neutrons outside the cluster than in the band theory .",
    "since the total number of free neutrons should be the same in both calculations , the difference in the density profile at large radius implies a larger difference in magnitude at small radius .",
    "this is more clearly seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : densfint ] , by plotting the integrated number @xmath50 of free neutrons inside the w - s cell at radius r , defined by @xmath51 @xmath52 being the local density of _ unbound _ neutrons .",
    "the figure shows that the w - s approximation underestimates the number @xmath53 of free neutrons inside the region of radius @xmath54 around the cluster and consequently overestimates the number @xmath55 of free neutrons outside . for both calculations ,",
    "the number of free neutrons in the cell is @xmath56 .",
    "quantitatively taking @xmath57 fm , the difference between the two calculations is about @xmath58 which is rather small .",
    "this first comparison shows that the single particle wave functions of unbound neutrons are qualitatively well reproduced by the w - s approximation inside the nuclear clusters .",
    "the main differences in the wavefunctions between the two calculations are found in the interstitial region due to the different boundary conditions .",
    "however this has a rather small effect on the ground state properties of the neutron gas , like the neutron density distribution .",
    "more generally the w - s approximation can be expected to be a good approximation to the full band theory for evaluating the matrix elements of any operator taking vanishing values outside the cluster region .",
    "[ fig : band_spectrum ] and [ fig : spectrum ] show the energy spectrum of the unbound neutrons obtained in the band theory and in the w - s approximation , respectively . it should be noted from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] that the spin - orbit splitting is very weak for d , f , g and h states ( as predicted by negele&vautherin  @xcite ) but not for p states .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spin - orbit splitting is proportional to the convolution of the density gradient together with the wave functions .",
    "the density gradient is localized in the central cluster while the d , f , g and h states are mostly in the external region . for those states ,",
    "the convolution leads to a weak splitting .    since in band theory ,",
    "the energies depend also on the wavevector @xmath10 , only the energy bands along some specific symmetry directions in @xmath10-space are displayed .",
    "the energy spectrum obtained with the w - s approximation is comparable to the one obtained in the band theory for the symmetry point @xmath59 corresponding to the center @xmath30 of the first brillouin zone ( w - s cell of the reciprocal lattice ) . the correspondence is not exact and the differences come from the spherical approximation . as a result ,",
    "the w - s approximation predicts less states but with larger degeneracies than the band theory at the symmetry point @xmath59 .",
    "the figures show clearly another important difference between the band theory and the w - s approximation : in the former case the energy spectrum is continuous while in the latter case it is discrete .    a relevant quantity to compare the energy spectra is the level density , which plays a pivotal role when calculating dynamical processes .",
    "it is defined by @xmath60 where the integral is taken over the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .    using the @xmath61 function to integrate out one of the variables",
    ", the level density becomes @xmath62 where the integral is taken over the surface of constant energy @xmath63 in @xmath10-space .",
    "expression ( [ level_density2 ] ) shows that the level density is a probe of the topology of constant energy surfaces in @xmath10-space .",
    "we have extracted the level density from band theory by using the gilat - raubenheimer method as in reference  @xcite .    in the w - s approximation",
    "the level density reduces to a discrete sum @xmath64    in fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] , we show the level density predicted by the band theory for the unbound single particle levels . as expected the figure shows that the energy spectrum in the band theory is continuous and has a complex fine structure .",
    "the spectrum exhibits a quasi band gap of about 30 kev slightly around 90 kev .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the w - s approximation for which the energy levels are discrete and separated by about 100 kev . in other words , the w - s approximation overestimates the neutron shell effects .",
    "the global energy dependence of the level density follows the behavior of the free fermi gas , @xmath65 where @xmath66 mev is the energy at the bottom of the valence band .",
    "the agreement between the two curves is very good for energies close to @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the fermi surface is nearly spherical at low energies as confirmed by the calculations shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : const_surf1 ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fermi wavelength of the unbound neutrons is much larger at low energies than the lattice spacing . as a consequence",
    "the effect of bragg diffraction is negligible .",
    "it can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] that distortions of the fermi surface from the spherical shape happens at energies larger than 0 .",
    "the first kink around the zero of energy is a characteristic van hove singularity ( as a result of the vanishing of the gradient @xmath68 at some @xmath10 points in the expression ( [ level_density2 ] ) , also visible on fig .",
    "[ fig : band_spectrum ] ) and indicates a topological transition of the fermi surface .",
    "this occurs when the fermi sphere touches the faces of the first brillouin zone . for a body centered cubic lattice",
    ", the transition takes place when the radius of the sphere is equal to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lattice spacing . above the first kink ,",
    "the fermi surface becomes non spherical with the appearance of necks close to the brillouin zone faces as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : const_surf2 ] .",
    "the fermi surface undergoes further topological changes as it crosses bragg planes ( higher brillouin zones ) as revealed by the singularities in the level density .",
    "the actual fermi surface ( associated with the 160 neutrons per cell ) has a very complicated shape with 11 branches ( associated with the 11 bands which cross the fermi level ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stateint ] , we show the integrated number of single particle levels which are below a given energy e @xmath71 the w - s approximation exhibits a stair steps structure due to the discretization of the states . as already noticed , the energy levels are discrete and highly degenerate , due to the imposed spherical symmetry around the cluster . in contrast , in the band theory the spherical symmetry is partly broken due to the translational symmetry of the crystal lattice .",
    "the energy levels thus broaden into bands , with a low residual degeneracy ( at most 6 at each @xmath10 point for cubic crystals , counting the spin degeneracy  @xcite ) , which overlap so that the energy spectrum is continuous .    in conclusion , for processes which involve transfered energies above the characteristic level spacing around the fermi energy , the differences between the w - s approximation and the full band theory are expected to be small .",
    "for instance , it is typically the case for neutrino response function  @xcite or thermal effects before the star cools completely down .",
    "however at lower energies , as pertaining for instance the effective neutron mass relevant for fluid dynamics  @xcite , the full band theory is required .",
    "the level spacing can be roughly evaluated from the quantity @xmath72 . from the top to the bottom layers of the crust ,",
    "the characteristic level spacing varies from about 100  kev to 200  kev , which corresponds to temperatures of the order of @xmath73  k. such temperatures are found in young neutron stars less than a few hundred years after their birth  @xcite .",
    "the w - s approximation is therefore well suited for describing the hot dense matter ( except for the high density layers where the spherical approximation may be too restrictive ) in young neutron stars and in the collapsing core of massive stars during supernova explosions  @xcite .",
    "this discussion however does not take into account pairing effects , which are negligible in the outermost layers of the crust considered in this work but are expected to be important in denser and deeper layers  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a recent study has shown that the pairing properties of the unbound neutrons are strongly sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions in the w - s approximation , especially in the bottom layers of the crust  @xcite .",
    "in this article , a comparison has been done between the full band theory and the w - s approximation which has been widely applied in studies of neutron star crust .",
    "the external layers of the inner crust at a baryon density @xmath74 g/@xmath34 composed of zirconium like clusters @xmath0zr have been considered . since the bound nucleons are not much affected by the boundary conditions , we have focused on the unbound neutrons .",
    "we have shown that the ground state properties such as the unbound neutron density distribution , are rather well reproduced by the w - s approximation , while the dynamical properties depend on the process of interest or the energy exchanged .",
    "it should also be noticed that depending on the quantities of interest , the free neutron model for the unbound neutrons could be a good first approximation . in the future",
    ", it could be interesting to explore an intermediate scheme which goes beyond the wigner - seitz approximation and remains simpler to implement in numerical calculations than the full band theory .",
    "the energy spectrum is continuous in the full band theory with no energy gaps while the w - s approximation yields a discrete spectrum thereby overestimating neutron shell effects .",
    "the w - s approximation can therefore be applied whenever the processes under considerations involve energies larger than the level spacing induced by the discretization , which in the present case is of order @xmath75 kev . in particular , the w - s approximation is well suited for describing the hot ( @xmath76 k ) dense matter in the inner crust of young neutron stars and in the collapsing core of massive stars during supernovae explosions .",
    "however low temperature transport processes such as the effective neutron mass relating the momentum to the velocity and giving rise to entrainment effects , require a fine knowledge of the energy spectrum around the fermi level ( _ i.e. _ the fermi surface ) which can not be reproduced by the w - s approximation .",
    "since the lattice spacing is predicted to decrease with increasing depth , becoming comparable to the size of the nuclear clusters and to the fermi wave length of the free neutrons at the bottom of the crust , the validity of the w - s approximation should be carefully investigated in the denser layers of the crust , especially concerning pairing effects .",
    "besides , the assumption of spherical symmetry in the w - s approximation is probably too restrictive near the crust - core interface where the clusters are expected to be strongly deformed  @xcite .",
