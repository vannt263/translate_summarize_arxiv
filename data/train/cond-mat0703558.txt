    "<S> we report a study of edge magnetoplasmons in a partially - screened system of electrons on a helium surface . </S>",
    "<S> we compare experimental results with theories of the frequency , damping , and penetration - depth dependence on magnetic field , temperature - dependent damping , and the dependence of the frequency on screening . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly the dependence of frequency on the edge density profile . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency and screening are in qualitative agreement with the theory of fetter at small fields , and the frequencies agree with theory in the limit of zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency and linewidths in intermediate and large fields exhibit the features of the qualitative predictions of volkov and mikhailov , but differ numerically . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from theory for a finite sample occur at smaller fields . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of frequency on the density profile is stronger than predicted by these authors , and the penetration - depth variation with field confirms their prediction for small fields .    </S>",
