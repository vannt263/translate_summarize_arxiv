    "-5 mm    dynamical systems as a discipline was born in henri poincar s famous treatise of the three body problem .",
    "in retrospect arguably one can view as his most remarkable discovery of the _",
    "homoclinic phenomenon_. stable and unstable manifolds of a fixed point or periodic point may intersect at a _ homoclinic point _ thereby producing a very complicated dynamic behavior  what we now often call chaotic .    in my opinion in the development of theory of dynamical systems  like in the development of all good mathematics ",
    "one can clearly see two stages .",
    "the first stage is the understanding of concrete examples and the second stage is generalization .",
    "a large part of the second encompasses the introduction of the right concepts which makes the arguments in the concrete examples into a theory .",
    "one such development starts with the two famous papers by m.  l.  cartwright and j.  littlewood `` on non - linear differential equations of the second order i and ii '' , which was among the first to treat nonlinear differential equations in depth .",
    "littlewood was astonished by the difficulties that arose in studying these model problems and called the second of these papers `` the monster '' .",
    "s.  smale gives in `` finding a horseshoe on the beaches of rio '' an entertaining account of how he was lead to his now ubiquitous horseshoe model for chaotic dynamics .",
    "in fact in his first paper in dynamical systems he made the conjecture that `` chaotic dynamics does not exist '' but received a letter from n.  levinson with a paper clarifying the previous work by cartwright and littlewood and which effectively contained a counterexample to smale s conjecture .",
    "levinson s paper contained extensive calculations which smale found difficult follow and this lead him to construct a model with minimal complexity but still with the main features of levinson s ode model .",
    "starting from the horseshoe model , smale and his group at berkeley started to develop the theory of uniformly hyperbolic or axiom a dynamical systems in the seventies .",
    "one central concept in this theory is that of an axiom a attractor for a diffeomorphism @xmath0 of a manifold @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an invariant set for a diffeomorphism of a manifold @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is said to be a _",
    "hyperbolic set _ for @xmath0 if there is a continuous splitting of the tangent bundle of @xmath1 restricted to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which is invariant under the derivative map @xmath4 : @xmath5 ; @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ; and for which there are constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for all @xmath12 and there is a uniform lower bound for the angle between stable and unstable manifolds : @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath2 is called an _ attractor _ ( in the sense of conley ) if there is a neighborhood @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this attractor is _ topologically transitive _ if there is @xmath17 with dense orbit in @xmath2 .",
    "if moreover @xmath18 is uniformly hyperbolic @xmath2 is an _ axiom a attractor_.    the ergodic theory of axiom a attractors was developed by sinai , ruelle and bowen in the 1970 . in particular for an axiom a attractor they constructed",
    "so called srb - measures : measures with absolutely continuous conditional measures on unstable manifolds .",
    "this measures @xmath19 are also _ physical measures _ in the sense of ruelle since for @xmath20 in a set of initial points of positive riemannian measure the birkhoff sums @xmath21 .",
    "in fact for a topologically transitive axiom a attractor @xmath19 is unique and the birkhoff sums converges for a.e .",
    "@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the _ basin of attraction _ @xmath24 .",
    "although the axiom a theory is quite satisfactory and complete it is not applicable to very many concrete dynamical systems .",
    "there is a general theory of ergodic theory of smooth dynamical systems due to among others pesin , katok , ledrappier and others but concrete examples were lacking . around",
    "1980 the theory of chaotic one - dimensional maps was started .",
    "m.  misiurewicz studied multimodal maps @xmath0 of the interval , whose critical set or set of turning points , @xmath25 , has the property that for all @xmath26 and all @xmath27 , @xmath28 and proved existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures .",
    "then collet and eckmann @xcite proved abundance , i.e. positive lebesgue measure , of aperiodic behavior for a family of unimodal maps of the interval and , jakobson in @xcite proved abundance of existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures for the quadratic family . a new proof of jakobson s theorem was then given by lennart carleson and myself in @xcite and the methods from this paper were later used by us in @xcite to prove aperiodic , chaotic behavior for a class of hnon maps , which are small perturbations of quadratic maps .",
    "the methods of @xcite have turned out to be useful for several other dynamical systems and the corresponding ergodic theory has been developed .",
    "there have been other accounts of this development , in particular by my collaborators lai - sang young ( see e.g. @xcite ) and marcelo viana ( see e.g. the proceedings of icm98 @xcite ) .",
    "-5 mm    in 1978 , m.  hnon proposed as a model for non - linear two - dimensional dynamical systems the map @xmath29 he chose the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 and proved that @xmath32 has an attractor in the sense of conley .",
    "he also verified numerically that this hnon map has sensitive dependence on initial conditions and produced his well - known computer pictures of the attractor .",
    "hnon proposed that this dynamical system should have a `` strange attractor '' and that it should be more eligible to analysis than the ubiquitous lorenz system .    in principle",
    "most initial points could be attracted to a long periodic cycle . in view of the famous result of s.  newhouse , @xcite , periodic attractors are topologically generic , so it was not at all a priori clear that the attractor seen by hnon was not a long stable periodic orbit .",
    "however lennart carleson and i , @xcite , managed to prove that what hnon conjectured was true  not for the parameters @xmath33 that hnon studied  but for small @xmath34 .",
    "in fact we managed to prove the following result :    * theorem 1 .",
    "*    _ there is a constant @xmath35 such that for all @xmath36 , @xmath37 there is a set @xmath38 of parameters @xmath39 , such that its one - dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath40 and such that for all @xmath41 , @xmath32 , has the following properties _    1 .",
    "there is an open set @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the unstable manifold of the fixed point @xmath46 of @xmath0 in the first quadrant .",
    "there is a point @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is dense on @xmath2 , and there is @xmath9 such that @xmath49 .    hence @xmath2 is a topological transitive attractor with sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "an immediate consequence of fubinis theorem is that the `` good parameter set '' @xmath50 is ( a cantor set ) of positive two - dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "the first part of the theorem is easy to prove and the result is true for an open set of parameters , i.e. for a small rectangle close to @xmath51 and @xmath52 contained in @xmath53 .",
    "the system is dissipative since @xmath54 . in this case",
    "applying an argument of palis and takens , @xcite , it follows that a region that is enclosed by pieces of stable and unstable manifolds of the same fixed point @xmath46 is attracted to the unstable manifold @xmath55 . with some additional arguments one can see that also a neighborhood of the closure of the unstable manifold is attracted .",
    "however the attractor could a priori be a proper subset of @xmath56 .    the second part of the theorem is only true for parameters @xmath57 .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of the second part of the theorem is the identification of a _",
    "critical set _",
    "@xmath25 for these hnon attractors .",
    "the set @xmath25 is countable and located on @xmath45 but it is natural to expect that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath58 is positive .    for each @xmath59",
    "the following holds : ( i ) @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the tangent vector of the unstable manifold at @xmath20 ; ( ii ) trough each @xmath59 there is a local unstable manifold @xmath62 , tangent to @xmath45 .",
    "the proof of the theorem is a huge induction in time @xmath63 .",
    "successively preliminary critical points or sets , _ precritical points _ , are defined on higher and higher _ generations _ of the unstable manifold .",
    "we roughly say that @xmath64 is of generation @xmath65 if @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the horizontal segment of the local unstable manifold @xmath45 through the fixed point .    in analogy with the methods from the one - dimensional case of @xcite parameters",
    "are chosen so that inductively @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the set of precritical points of generation @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a suitably chosen numerical constant .",
    "moreover a further parameter selection is made so that , informally speaking , too deep returns close to the critical set do not occur too often . the estimate of the measure of the set , deleted because of this condition , is made by a large deviation argument .",

    "@xmath84 as @xmath79 , where @xmath85 is the normal distribution function @xmath86 .    the methods used to prove this theorem involved the definition of a return set @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a set of approximately horizontal long unstable manifolds @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a set of approximately vertical stable manifolds @xmath91 , indexed , say , by an arclength coordinate of its intersection with one of the unstable manifolds of @xmath88 . a dynamical tower construction was made and a markov extension ( markov partition on the tower ) was constructed",
    "one of the key estimates concerns the distribution of the return time @xmath92 for @xmath93 , which is defined as the time the image a partition element @xmath94 returns to the base of the tower .",

    "in particular she managed to prove exponential decay of correlation for dissipative billiards ( @xcite ) .    _ the metric basin problem . _",
    "a natural question that arises in connection with theorem 2 is for which set of initial points @xmath20 the birkhoff sums @xmath101 converge weak-@xmath78 to the srb - measure @xmath19 .",
    "as previously mentioned from the smooth ergodic theory it only follows that this is true for a set of initial points of positive two - dimensional lebesgue measure .    in @xcite ,",
    "marcelo viana and i were able to complete the picture : in fact almost all points of the topological basin are generic for the srb - measure and the basin is foliated by stable manifolds .",

    "they managed to carry out the same program as in theorem 1 for these class of maps , which they called _ hnon - like maps _ , and managed to prove prevalence of strange attractors , i.e. that there is a set of positive measure of parameters @xmath39 so that @xmath110 exhibits a strange attractor .",
    "mora&viana used a one - parameter family of maps @xmath111 , @xmath112 , such that @xmath113 has a homoclinic tangency and proved that there is a positive measure set of parameters @xmath19 and a neighborhood @xmath114 such that @xmath115 has a hnon - like strange attractor .",
    "this is done following palis&takens @xcite , by proving that there is a linear change of variables and in the parameters @xmath116 so that @xmath117 , where @xmath81 satisfies the appropriate estimates of the hnon - like maps .",
    "note that the consequence of this is not the existence of a global attractor as in theorem 1 but the existence of a local attractor close to the homoclinic tangency .",
    "( a homoclinic tangency does really occur close to hnon s classical parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 : this was proved by fornaess and gavasto , @xcite . )    _ saddle node bifurcations . _",
    "another case where methods based on those in @xcite turned out to be useful is the case of saddle node bifurcations treated by diaz , rocha and viana in @xcite . in that paper",
    "they show that when unfolding a one - parameter family with a critical saddle node cycle hnon like strange attractors appear with positive density at the bifurcation value .",
    "moreover they prove that in an open class of such families the strange attractors are of global type .",
    "this work was continued by m.j .",
    "costa @xcite , @xcite , who proved that global strange attractors also appear when destroying a hyperbolic set ( horseshoe ) by collapsing it with a periodic attractor .",
    "_ viana s dynamical systems with multiple expanding directions_. in @xcite , m.  viana studied the dynamical system @xmath118 given by the the following skew product @xmath119 , where @xmath120 .",

    "also considers skew products of hnon maps driven by circle endomorphisms .",
    "an important difference with the situation in this paper compared to earlier work in the area is that the exponential approach rate condition of an orbit relative to the critical set is no longer satisfied .",
    "instead this is replaced by a statistical property : very deep and very frequent returns to the critical region is very unlikely .",
    "the argument is based on an extension of the large deviation argument from @xcite .",

    "_ motivated by the study of unfolding of saddle - focus connections for flows in three dimensions pacifico , rovella and viana , @xcite , studied parameterized families of one - dimensional maps with infinitely many critical points .",
    "they prove that for a positive lebesgue measure set of parameter values the map is transitive and almost all orbits have positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work on flows , by viana , luzatto , pumario , rodrguez and others , where techniques from @xcite have played an important role . for a survey of these and related results",
    "i refer to @xcite .    in a different direction",

    "young , @xcite , carry out a theory of attractors which generalize the hnon maps in a different direction .",
    "they consider maps of a two - dimensional manifold of the form @xmath128 .",
    "this class clearly differs from the hnon - like maps of mora&viana .",
    "in particular the theory applies to perturbations of certain one - dimensional multimodal maps , with a transversality condition in the parameter dependence .",
    "the techniques are analogous to these in @xcite but more information on the geometric structure , in particular of the critical set , is achieved .",
    "most previous results are obtained in this setting but also new results , e.g. on some similar dynamical systems and on topological entropy .",
    "-5 mm    a natural question is how the statistical properties of a dynamical system with chaotic behavior behaves when it is perturbed randomly by some small noise at each iterate . here",
    "we will mainly consider independent additive noise and assume that the underlying ambient space @xmath1 is either a subset of euclidean space or a torus but cases of more general manifolds and more general perturbations can also be considered ( for this see several papers and books by y.  kiefer ) .",
    "let @xmath129 and suppose that @xmath130 , @xmath131 , are independent identically distributed random variables with an absolutely continuous probability density supported in a small ball @xmath132 around the origin and consider the markov chain @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 .",
    "then there is a stationary transition probability @xmath135 and also at least some stationary measure @xmath136 satisfying the fixed point equation @xmath137 .",

    "now such results have also been obtained for the non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems described above . in the case of the quadratic interval maps of @xcite , l.s .",
    "young and i proved in @xcite , under suitable assumptions on the density of the perturbations , that @xmath138 is unique and @xmath140 weak-@xmath78 , as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "v.  baladi and m.  viana , @xcite , managed to improve this to prove that the density of @xmath138 , @xmath143 , converges to @xmath80 in @xmath144-norm .",
    "m.  viana and i have recently proved results on weak-@xmath78 stochastic stability for the hnon maps of @xcite and the hnon - like maps of @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for a recent paper on decay of correlation for _ random skew products _ of quadratic maps see baladi&benedicks&maume - deschampes @xcite .",
    "-5 mm      the general belief is that at least for some parameters @xmath146 there is at least one ergodic component of positive lebesgue measure with positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "nothing is however rigorously known in spite of intensive work by many people .",
    "one of the most interesting results by duarte @xcite goes in the opposite direction : for a residual set of parameters @xmath146 the closure of the elliptic points can have hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to 2 .",
    "one important difference between the standard map and the hnon maps for the good parameters is that `` the critical set '' in the hnon case is rather small .",
    "it has a hierarchical structure and conjecturally the hausdorff dimension of its closure should be @xmath147 .",
    "the critical set for the standard map ( if possible to define ) should have hausdorff - dimension @xmath148 .      on natural class of problem is to consider are _ skew products _ of viana s type , where the parameters are driven by more general maps .",
    "one possible choice is to let the driving map be a non - uniformly hyperbolic quadratic map , either a misiurewicz map or more generally the class of quadratic maps of @xcite , @xcite",
    ". a more difficult project would be to study the case when driving map is a circle rotation .    _ the general picture for dissipative hnon maps_. it is a natural question to consider what happens for other parameters than the ones considered in @xcite .",
    "one possible scenario is outlined in the following questions , which are much related to j.  palis conjectures , @xcite , in the @xmath149-generic setting .",
    "if this is true the newhouse phenomenon of infinitely coexisting sinks and colli s situation @xcite of infinitely many coexisting hnon - like strange attractors would only appear for a lebesgue zero set of parameters @xmath150 ?",
    "this result if true would correspond to the real fatou conjecture proved fairly recently by graczyk&swiatek , @xcite , and lyubich @xcite .",
    "a positive answer to question 1 would correspond to lyubich s result that almost all points in the quadratic family is either regular or stochastic , @xcite .    as can be seen from the above dynamical systems is a beautiful mixture of topology and analysis . to the hard analysis of cartwright , littlewood and levinson ,",
    "smale was able to provide a topological counterpart .",
    "recently again more analytical methods have played an important role .",
