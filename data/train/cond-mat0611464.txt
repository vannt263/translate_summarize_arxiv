    "one of the most prominent quantum phenomena in mesoscopic physics is the effect of conductance quantization .",
    "the conductance of a quantum point contact measured as a function of an applied gate voltage exhibits plateaus at integer multiples of the conductance quantum , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron charge and @xmath2 is planck s constant @xcite .",
    "these steps are well understood in terms of non - interacting electrons @xcite . but",
    "experimental conductance curves frequently show an additional plateau - like feature below the first conductance step at a value around @xmath3 .",
    "this so - called _  0.7 anomaly \" _ was first investigated experimentally by thomas _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who particularly looked at the magnetic field- and temperature dependence of the additional plateau .",
    "they found that the 0.7-feature develops smoothly into the zeeman spin - split plateau at @xmath4 by applying a parallel in - plane magnetic field .",
    "that is why those authors related this anomaly to the spin degree of freedom of the electrons .",
    "they conjectured the presence of spin polarization in quasi one - dimensional junctions .",
    "in addition , thomas and coworkers revealed that the 0.7 plateau becomes more pronounced if the temperature is increased .    since those first measurements there has been much experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite effort to explain the origin of this effect .",
    "however , a complete understanding is still missing .",
    "experiments show a zero - bias peak in the differential conductance typical for the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence can be characterized by a single parameter which was interpreted as the kondo temperature . in a recent experiment @xcite a static spin polarization",
    "was measured , which contradicts the kondo interpretation .",
    "shot noise measurements @xcite could show that two differently transmitting channels contribute to transport .",
    "theoretical studies of this phenomenon are , on the one hand , based on calculations using density functional theory ( dft ) , @xcite . in an early publication wang and berggren showed how coulomb interaction can split the energy levels of up- and down electrons in a quasi one - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "they used dft calculations with hartree- and exchange potentials in local density approximation .",
    "their findings were confirmed by more sophisticated calculations which include exchange - correlation potentials and take into account realistic gate potentials @xcite .",
    "the observed difference of the up- and down energy levels gives rise to spin dependent transmissions which manifest themselves in a 0.7 feature in the total conductance .",
    "however , to our knowledge there are no dft results showing the correct temperature dependence .    besides dft calculations , there are various theoretical models describing different aspects of the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "some models are based on the presence of spin - splitting @xcite , assuming a density dependent separation of the up- and down energy levels from the beginning .",
    "these models can qualitatively reproduce the correct magnetic field and temperature dependence of the 0.7 structure and are also suitable to describe shot noise @xcite . in a complementary approach",
    "the 0.7 anomaly is related to the kondo effect @xcite by treating the quantum point contact as an interacting two - level system for the different spins .",
    "qualitatively , this approach also leads to the observed temperature and magnetic field behavior of the 0.7 feature @xcite .",
    "very recently , also shot noise was calculated within this model showing agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , interaction with phonons is used to explain the unusual temperature dependence @xcite .    in this work we present a comparatively simplified approach to the problem , which is based on the non - equilibrium green function technique where the interaction is incorporated at the hartree - fock level .",
    "we shall , furthermore , approximate the screened coulomb interaction between the electrons by a repulsive contact potential . the fact that we can , within this approach , reproduce all relevant features of the 0.7 anomaly at temperatures close to zero , including the recently observed modification of the shot noise factor @xcite , supports arguments in favor of the spin - splitting mechanism @xcite ( in line with experimental evidence provided in ref .",

    "we discuss the zero field case and show results concerning shot noise and finite temperatures . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss transport of fermionic atoms through a constriction .",
    "the appendix consists of a part about determining the strength of the interaction constant and other model parameters in an ideal two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "another part contains a detailed description of how to extend the recursive green function algorithm to non - equilibrium processes .",
    "we describe a two - dimensional electron system with an additional in - plane confinement potential @xmath5 that defines the geometry of the quantum point contact .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field @xmath6 oriented towards the transport direction gives rise to a zeeman term only . for moderate magnetic fields the orbital contribution vanishes with the choice @xmath7 for the vector potential and @xmath8 for the location of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "therefore , the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the effective mass and @xmath11 is the spin quantum number .",

    "the thomas - fermi screening length is of the order @xmath19 and the width of a typical constriction is roughly @xmath20 , see appendix [ app : screening ] .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that our model gives an accurate description of the interaction .",

    "we find that @xmath21 gives a realistic order of magnitude for the interaction strength .    to calculate the transport properties of the system we use the keldysh green function approach @xcite .",
    "this approach is very general as it allows to treat interactions and to include finite temperatures and bias voltages .",

    "we take into account the first order of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the corresponding retarded self - energy is usually written as a sum of the hartree and fock self - energies , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and has the form @xcite @xmath26 in general , the hartree self - energy is local , and it involves a sum over all spin directions , whereas the fock self - energy is non - local and depends only on the lesser green function of the same spin orientation .",
    "however , in our case of delta - interactions , eq .  ( [ h_int ] ) , both the hartree and the fock contribution are local .",
    "@xmath25 exactly compensates the @xmath27-term of the spin sum in @xmath24 , and we easily obtain for the total interaction self - energy @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the density of electrons with spin @xmath30 .",
    "the hamilton operator of the interacting system , @xmath31 , is a sum of the non - interacting hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and the interaction self - energy ( [ int_self_energy ] ) , which acts like an additional local potential .",
    "this potential is different for the different spin directions : a spin - up electron encounters a potential which is proportional to the density of spin - down electrons , and vice versa .",
    "hence , there is a repulsive interaction only between particles with opposite spin directions .",
    "therefore , any small imbalance between the density of up- and down electrons is increased by this kind of interaction .    to solve the transport problem we discretize the spatial coordinates .",
    "the derivatives in the hamiltonian are then written as finite differences , and the hamilton operator is represented by a block - diagonal matrix @xcite .",

    "however , it is possible to implement a recursive algorithm that calculates the green function of single slices of the scattering region and couples the slices via a dyson equation .",
    "the details of this algorithm are explained in appendix [ app : rec_alg ] .",
    "the recursive scheme scales with the third power of the width and only linearly with the length of the system .",
    "thereby it is much more efficient than a direct matrix inversion .    from the retarded green function we get the lesser function using the kinetic equation @xmath46 where the advanced green function is obtained by hermitian conjugation , @xmath47^{\\dagger}$ ] .",
    "the lesser self - energy is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the fermi - dirac function .",

    "we find that for a small coupling constant @xmath57 the up- and down contribution @xmath58 and @xmath59 differ from each other .",
    "this difference is not due to the zeeman shift , as the zeeman energy is approximately two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "it is caused by the effective repulsive interaction between electrons with different spin orientations .",
    "if the interaction strength is increased the up- and down contributions split more and more .",
    "additionally , a small shoulder develops in the curve for the total conductance at values between @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the conductance quantum .",

    "[ fig : splitting ] show that the energy levels @xmath71 are located around @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "they are very weakly split by the zeeman energy .",
    "with increasing @xmath38 the levels rise in energy as the constriction is populated with electrons and then start to split distinctly , as soon as the chemical potential is comparable with the energy levels @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that due to the zeeman splitting the down - level is populated already at a lower chemical potential causing an imbalance between the density of spin - up and spin - down carriers in the constriction .",
    "the repulsive interaction between opposite spins tends to increase any imbalance .",
    "a small excess of down electrons repels up electrons from the constriction , which results in a larger excess of down particles .",
    "the spin - splitting vanishes when the chemical potential is well above both energy levels . in the range of the chemical potential where the up- and down energy levels are split , also the up- and down contribution to",
    "the conductance differs , as shown in fig .",

    "the transverse modes are broadened with a width of the order of @xmath75 , as can be seen in the conductance curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : g_dep ] .",
    "therefore , our results seem to confirm the assumption of the spin - splitting models , that the energy levels start to split as soon as the chemical potential crosses the up- and down energy levels .",
    "additionally , we observe a  pinning \" of the upper energy level to the chemical potential within a substantial range of @xmath38 , that means @xmath76 evolves parallel to the chemical potential @xmath38 right after the splitting .",
    "the presence of this level pinning is essential in the spin - splitting models in order to get a 0.7-plateau . in our calculations",
    "the plateau also appears in the range where level pinning is present .",
    "the shape of the conductance curves is influenced by the magnetic field .",
    "[ fig : bdep ] shows that the 0.7 plateau evolves from a small shoulder at @xmath77 to a wide plateau at @xmath78 as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "this is in agreement with experiments @xcite . in the high - field limit",
    "zeeman splitting is the dominant effect .",
    "the energy levels of the different spins are separated by the zeeman energy which causes a plateau at @xmath79 even in the case of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the reason is that spin - down electrons contribute to transport at chemical potentials @xmath80 , whereas for spin - up electrons @xmath81 has to be fulfilled . for strong magnetic fields",
    "the effect of electron - electron interaction is only to broaden the zeeman spin - split plateau at one half of the conductance quantum .    for a more quantitative comparison between our results and experimental data",
    "it is useful to re - scale our quantities and give the magnetic fields in units of tesla .",
    "therefore , we have to associate an energy value with @xmath54 . if we insert the approximate width @xmath82 of a quantum point contact from eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) we get @xmath83 the maximum field applied in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdep ] then corresponds to @xmath84 where we used @xmath85 for bulk gaas and a density of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this magnetic field value is lower than in experiments where fields of about @xmath87 are necessary to get a plateau at @xmath79 @xcite .      for the previous calculations we always applied a finite magnetic field .",
    "due to this field the energy levels of the electrons with different spins were separated so that the down state can be populated at smaller chemical potentials than the up state .",
    "that is the reason why up electrons are repelled from entering the constriction , as down electrons are already present at a lower chemical potential .",
    "so the repulsive interaction between particles with opposite spins leads to an enhancement of an initially small asymmetry between the density of up- and down electrons in the constriction .",
    "however , in the case of zero magnetic field the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) together with the interaction self - energy ( [ int_self_energy ] ) is strictly symmetric with respect to spin - up and spin - down .",
    "therefore , the resulting conductance curves also have to show the same symmetry .",
    "the result for @xmath88 and @xmath89 is displayed as the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerofield ] .",
    "as expected the contributions of the up- and down electrons exactly coincide and the total conductance has no additional features below the first step .",
    "we can investigate the stability of the symmetric solution by slightly disturbing the symmetry of the system .",
    "for each point calculated we start with a small magnetic field @xmath90 . during the first four steps of the self consistency loop we turn off the magnetic field according to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of the iteration step . after four steps we set the magnetic field exactly to zero and",
    "continue iterating until the results are converged . in that way we obtain an asymmetric solution for the spin - up and spin - down contributions .",
    "in contrast to the finite field results depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : g_dep ] , here the splitting sets in abruptly at a chemical potential @xmath93 . in the range where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are different a shoulder appears in the total conductance @xmath94 .",
    "those points where the spin - splitting is absent coincide with the points for @xmath88 .",
    "so the symmetric solution with @xmath95 is unstable and we find a 0.7 anomaly even in the case of zero magnetic field .    in our case",
    "the down - contribution to the conductance dominates when we apply a positive magnetic field . with a negative field the different spin directions would change their roles . in reality",
    "the asymmetry between spin - up and spin - down may be caused by residual magnetic fields or temporal current fluctuations .",
    "also magnetic impurities , as well as nuclear spins and dynamic nuclear polarization might play a role in breaking the up- and down - symmetry .",
    "our numerical results show that a very weak asymmetry is sufficient to get spin - splitting .",
    "we obtained spin - split results for zeeman energies down to @xmath96 , corresponding to a magnetic field strength of about @xmath97 .      in recent experiments shot noise was measured in quantum point contacts exhibiting a 0.7 anomaly @xcite . in the framework of landauer - bttiker theory the shot noise power @xmath98 in a two - terminal device is given by @xcite @xmath99 here , @xmath100 is the fermi distribution function of the left / right contact .",

    "whereas the conductance is proportional to the total transmission , @xmath109 , the noise factor in the single mode case is @xmath110 . only in the case of non - interacting particles where @xmath111",

    "they find a suppression of noise around the anomalous conductance plateau .",
    "that gives experimental evidence that near the 0.7 feature electrons are transported by two channels with different transmissions , as also stated in @xcite .",
    "this agrees with our results for @xmath58 and @xmath59 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_dep ] . for conductance values between 0 and 1 the experimentalists find an asymmetric dome shape for the noise factor evolving into a symmetric double - dome structure by applying a magnetic field .",

    "in contrast to the model results in @xcite where the maximum of the right dome is stationary it first rises slightly in our model and then drops down again for @xmath117 . however , for very strong magnetic fields , @xmath118 , ( @xmath119 ) , the noise factor is symmetric with two maxima at @xmath120 .",

    ", however , the temperature affects only the computation of the conductance whereas the spin - splitting is assumed to be temperature independent . in our calculation",
    "the temperature also enters in the computation of the density , eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) , as @xmath123 is truncated around the fermi level plus several @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the densities and thus the interaction potentials depend on the temperature which results in a temperature dependent spin - splitting .",

    "finite temperatures lead to a smearing of the conductance and a 0.7 structure is found for temperatures smaller than the spin - gap , @xmath127 @xcite . in our model the energy levels exhibit a broadening due to the geometry of the system even at zero temperature , @xmath128 .",
    "the broadening is of the order @xmath75 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g_dep ] ) , larger than the level splitting ( see fig .  [",

    "hence , allowing for finite temperatures the broadening is further enhanced which leads to a decrease of the 0.7 plateau .",
    "the presented model describes transport of locally interacting electrons . in hartree - fock approximation",
    "only electrons with different spins are interacting repulsively .",
    "this suggests a very intuitive physical picture : if the scattering region is predominantly occupied by one spin species , electrons with opposite spin are repelled from the constriction .",
    "so this kind of interaction favors an asymmetric population of the quantum point contact . despite its simplicity",
    "the model is adequate to qualitatively explain different aspects of the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "we see how interaction can cause an asymmetry between the spin - up and spin - down transmission resulting in a shoulder in the total transmission .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the 0.7 feature is well reproduced and we find an instability phenomenon in the zero field case leading to spontaneous spin polarization .",
    "our model also accounts for shot noise suppression at the 0.7 plateau .",
    "going beyond hartree - fock one expects that spin - splitting is weakened or even vanishing in the strict one - dimensional case .",
    "however , it was shown by exact methods that hubbard chain models can have a ferromagnetic ground state if one is not restricted to exactly one - dimensional systems @xcite , in accordance with the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "so in our system which is based on a two - dimensional description a spin polarized ground state is possible .",
    "because the assumption of a delta - like interaction potential might be too crude for the junction in the 2deg , we also performed calculations with coulomb interaction and full exchange . for the conductance curves we found similar results as for delta interaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coulomb ] for different coupling strengths .",

    "so the effect of spin - splitting remains robust even in the limit without screening . in the case of coulomb interaction",

    "we therefore can conclude that the repulsive interaction between electrons with opposite spin causes spin - splitting even in the case of long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "our approach can not reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the plateau structure @xcite , which is also the case for dft calculations @xcite .",
    "this admits two possible interpretations : on the one hand , kondo - type correlations could be responsible for the temperature - induced enhancement of the 0.7 feature .",
    "this mechanism was theoretically suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimentally supported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but still awaits ultimate confirmation by _ ab initio _ calculations that are able to take into account such correlations and do not involve any tunable parameter .",
    "it was , on the other hand , suggested @xcite that _ phonons _ could be at the origin of this effect .      to discriminate between these two complementary interpretations",

    "would be required in order to trap both spin species of the fermionic atom",
    ". a quasi two - dimensional configuration could , for instance , be realized by a rather strong one - dimensional _ optical lattice _ which creates a sequence of disk - like confinement geometries for the atoms , and a matter - wave guide with a constriction could be induced by additional laser beams that are focused onto the disk within which the atoms are confined .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective interaction constant @xmath18 that characterizes the contact potential ( [ h_int ] ) would , in the case of two - dimensional ultracold fermions , be given by @xmath136 here , @xmath10 is the mass of the atom , @xmath137 denotes the frequency of the harmonic confinement in the transverse direction ( i.e. , along the `` third '' dimension ) , @xmath138 is the corresponding oscillator length , @xmath50 denotes the total energy of the collision process between two atoms in the center - of - mass frame , and @xmath139 represents the @xmath92-wave scattering length between two atoms with opposite spin .",
    "both length scales , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , can be manipulated , via feshbach tuning ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as through the intensity of the optical lattice .",
    "it would therefore be possible to realize configurations for which the effective interaction strength @xmath18 is of the order of the values that were discussed in section [ sec : results ] .    to measure the atomic 0.7 anomaly",
    ", we propose to prepare the fermionic atoms in a large double - well trap that is optically created within the two - dimensional confinement geometry , and let them escape from one well to the other through a small `` bottleneck '' corresponding to the constriction of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterer ] . counting the number of atoms that are transported across the bottleneck within a finite time scale",
    "should give rise to a _",
    "current _ of atoms close to the fermi level .",
    "this current can be directly translated into an `` atomic conductance '' in a similar way as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which would also display a step - like behavior when the height of the constriction is lowered by optical techniques .",
    "magnetic fields can again be used to break the symmetry between spin - up and spin - down fermions , and the temperature could possibly be controlled by letting the fermionic cloud interact with a gas or condensate of bosonic atoms ( e.g. , by preparing a mixture of @xmath135li and @xmath141li atoms ) .",
    "as phonons are clearly absent in this setup , any observed feature in the 0.7 anomaly that is not reproducible by mean - field approaches would necessarily be due to ( kondo - type ) correlations .    in short summary",
    ", is should be possible to realize transport experiments with ultracold fermionic atoms where the 0.7 anomaly in the conductance would be observed .",
    "we expect that such experiments would provide new insight into the central mechanism that underlies this phenomenon .",
    "we thank milena grifoni , tobias paul and michael wimmer for helpful discussions and we acknowledge support by the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ within the research training group grk 638 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath18 is the main parameter of our model .",
    "it has to be sufficiently high in order to get an observable effect of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "here we want to estimate an upper limit of the interaction strength using an exponentially screened coulomb potential .    in a homogeneous 2deg the screening length @xmath142 in thomas - fermi approximation",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the average dielectric constant of the two materials on both sides of the 2deg .",
    "for a gaas / algaas interface we find @xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath131 was used . to compare the screening length with the width of the constriction , we have to estimate the typical dimensions of a point contact .",
    "the lithographic width is of the order of several hundred nanometers , but the electrons are confined by the electrostatic potential due to the gates .",
    "the effective width of the constriction is then controlled by the gate voltage . from experiments",
    "we know the typical density of carriers @xmath147 which is related to the chemical potential @xmath148 .",
    "when the first channel opens the effective width can be estimated by equating the chemical potential with the energy of the first sub - band @xmath149 for a parabolic confinement .",
    "the width of the confinement potential at this energy is @xmath150 , which gives @xmath151 so we find that the effective width of a quantum point contact is of the order @xmath152 . inside the constriction",
    "the density is expected to be lower than in the homogeneous 2deg , so the effective width will be larger than the above estimated value .    for @xmath153-interaction the coupling constant",
    "is given by the spatial integral over the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "so we calculate the corresponding quantity for a screened coulomb potential @xmath154 inserting the screening length , eq .",
    "( [ scr_length ] ) , we find @xmath155 this is just a rough estimation as several aspects are neglected .",
    "first , in thomas - fermi approximation the screening length in two dimensions is independent of the electron density .",
    "but beyond this approximation one finds an increasing screening length as the charge density goes to zero @xcite .",
    "this reflects that screening is less efficient if the particle density is too small .",
    "second , screening in two dimensions is not as strong as in three - dimensional systems .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the screened potential is not exponential , but it follows an @xmath156 law @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting coupling constant does not differ dramatically from the one obtained by exponential screening . both facts would give rise to an even higher upper limit of the coupling strength .",
    "the recursive green function algorithm is widely used for calculating electronic properties of two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "the basic idea is to build up the full green function slice by slice instead of evaluating it in one step .",
    "thus , the dimensions of the matrices that have to be inverted are strongly reduced . if the green function @xmath157 of a semi - infinite region and an adjacent _ isolated _ slice is known , it is possible to calculate the green function @xmath94 of the _ coupled _ system using dyson s equation @xmath158 ( for this derivation we omit the spin index @xmath30 and the superscript @xmath159 for the retarded functions ) .",
    "here , @xmath160 denotes the hopping matrix between the two adjacent slices .",
    "the green function of a semi - infinite lead can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "so it is possible to start with an isolated lead and then add slice by slice until the opposite lead is reached .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recursive ] . after coupling that lead to the rest of the system one has obtained the green function of the complete system at the surface of one lead .",
    "this green function contains all information to calculate the current through the system .",
    "the above described procedure is explained for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we are interested also in the electronic density which is determined by the lesser function @xmath23 , the above explained algorithm is not sufficient . here",
    "we present an extension to the usual recursive green function method which allows us to calculate the retarded green function between the two leads as well as the lesser green function ( see also ref .",
    "the condition to apply this algorithm is that all relevant self - energies are diagonal so that the effective hamiltonian that has to be inverted , eq .",
    "( [ greenfunction ] ) , keeps its block - diagonal structure .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for the hartree self - energy and also for the fock self - energy in our case of delta interaction . in the general case of full coulomb interaction the fock self - energy",
    "is not diagonal , see eq .",
    "( [ selfenergies ] ) , so the presented method can not be used .",
    "we first show how to add one single slice to a semi - infinite region . in the following we use the notation @xmath161 for the green function of an isolated slice @xmath162 , and @xmath163 for the green function of the right / left semi - infinite region starting at slice @xmath162 .",
    "the full green function of the complete ( infinite ) system is denoted by @xmath94 ( without superscripts ) . in order to couple the green function @xmath161 of the isolated slice @xmath162 to the green function @xmath164 that covers all lattice sites to the right of @xmath165 , we use the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) , @xmath166 as @xmath164 has no matrix elements with slice @xmath162 , the terms @xmath167 vanish and we get @xmath168 noting that @xmath161 has only non - zero matrix elements with slice @xmath162 we get the constraint @xmath169 . as the coupling matrix @xmath160 acts only between adjacent slices and has no overlap with other slices @xmath170",
