    "a large body of empirical evidence as well as theoretical experience has been accumulated in treating two - dimensional digital data owing to the large amount of data requiring treatment in practical contexts .",
    "we approach the problem from the opposite direction .",
    "our departure point , rather than a set of specific @xmath6 data , are properties of new special functions in @xmath7 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this presents certain advantages and disadvantages , some of which are listed in the concluding remarks .",
    "the most important distinction is undoubtedly the possibility to carry out any analysis of lattice data in the fourier space rather than in the data space .    in this paper ,",
    "common cosine transforms in one and two dimensions @xcite are based on the symmetric group @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "our approach to @xmath6 problems is built on group @xmath10 and on its affine extension .",
    "the special functions differ essentially from the product of trigonometric functions each depending on a single variable extending in mutually orthogonal directions in the case of @xmath9 .",
    "we start with the properties of the special functions of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to take advantage of the fact that , when working in @xmath6 , many specific properties of functions can be expressed explicitly and more detailed questions can be answered than in the case of the general dimension @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider two families of symmetric and antisymmetric special functions of two real variables",
    ". they can be viewed as generalizations of the common exponential and cosine functions of one variable .    for each family ,",
    "we study : ( i ) the orthogonality of the functions on a lattice of chosen density within an appropriate finite region of the real euclidean space @xmath12 , and the corresponding finite fourier expansions of digital data functions sampled on such lattices .",
    "( ii ) the interpolation technique of the digital data used for the expansions into a continuous differentiable function .",
    "interpolation quality is assessed as a function of the density of the lattice .",
    "cosine transforms of types i , ii , iii , and iv @xcite can be generalized by situating the points of the sampling grid in a general position within the orthogonality region .",
    "it is important to point out those versions of the formalism by which the undesirable gibbs effect can be avoided @xcite .",
    "the definition of the symmetric and antisymmetric exponential functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 is analogous to the definition of so called @xmath15 and @xmath16functions , where instead of the symmetric group @xmath11 , the weyl group @xmath17 of some compact semisimple lie groups is used  @xcite .",
    "so called @xmath18functions  @xcite which are based on even subgroup of the weyl group @xmath17 are analogous to alternating exponential functions  @xcite . in some cases",
    ", a direct relation between these two concepts can be found  @xcite .",
    "the coincidences of the orbit functions are due to the known isomorphism of the symmetric group @xmath11 and the weyl group of the lie group @xmath19 , and of the alternating subgroup of @xmath11 and the even subgroup of the weyl group .    in section  2 ,",
    "the antisymmetric and symmetric 2-dimensional functions are defined respectively as @xmath20 determinants and permanents @xcite of exponential functions of one variable .",
    "properties of the antisymmetric functions ( determinants ) are considered first , namely their continuous and discrete orthogonality , the discrete fourier transforms , and others .",
    "an exposition of analogous properties of the symmetric functions ( permanents ) follows .",
    "examples of real and imaginary parts of the functions are shown in fig .  1 and 2 .",
    "section  3 is devoted to @xmath6 interpolation by symmetric and antisymmetric exponential functions .",
    "general @xmath6 interpolations are recalled , followed by a detailed study of interpolation by antisymmetric functions .",
    "examples of the interpolation of the model function in fig .  3 are shown in fig .  4 for several densities of the sampling grid .",
    "interpolation properties of the symmetric exponential function follow .",
    "examples of the interpolation of the same model function are shown in fig .",
    "interpolation errors are summarized in table  1 .",
    "section  4 parallels sec ,  2 and 3 , except that the exponential functions are replaced by @xmath20 antisymmetric ( determinants ) and symmetric ( permanents ) of cosine functions .",
    "examples of antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions are shown respectively in fig .  6 and 8 ;",
    "interpolation examples can be found in fig .  7 and 9 .",
    "interpolation quality in the above examples is compared in table  1 .",
    "the difference between the model function and its interpolations is integrated over the whole orthogonality region .",
    "the last example deals with known undesirable effect of fourier interpolation , referred to as the gibbs effect @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the gibbs effect is absent in two versions of our @xmath6 cosine transforms , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the last section contains various related comments and remarks .",

    "the analog of the gibbs phenomenon appears in fourier interpolating functions  @xcite .",
    "since the ( anti)symmetric and periodic extensions of continuous functions on @xmath38 may generate discontinuities of the resulting functions on the borders of @xmath38 , the gibbs phenomenon is in general to be expected for the interpolating functions * @xmath303 : on the borders @xmath241 , @xmath240 and @xmath50 * @xmath304 : on the borders @xmath241 , @xmath240 * @xmath310 and @xmath305 : on the border @xmath50 .",

    "an analogous presentation of the properties of the transforms built on sine functions would be of interest .",
    "none of the six families of special functions considered in the paper correspond to the well known cosine or sine transforms @xcite , where one dimensional transforms are used simultaneously in two mutually orthogonal directions .",
