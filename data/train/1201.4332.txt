    "a _ hadamard matrix _ @xmath3 of order @xmath4 is an @xmath5 matrix with elements @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a hadamard matrix is said to be normalized if it has its first row and column all @xmath8 .",
    "we can always normalize a hadamard matrix by multiplying rows and columns by @xmath9 .",
    "these matrices must have order 1 , 2 or a multiple of 4 .",
    "it is conjectured that hadamard matrices exist for every @xmath10 .",
    "although no proof of this fact is known , there is much evidence about its validity ( see @xcite and the references there cited ) .",
    "two hadamard matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called _ equivalent _ ( or hadamard equivalent , or @xmath3-equivalent ) if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of row and/or column interchanges and row and/or column negations .",
    "the question of classifying hadamard matrices of order @xmath13 remains unanswered and only partial results are known @xcite .    problems involving hadamard matrices sound very easy , but they are notoriously difficult to solve . one interesting open problem , among others , is the question of the largest pivot encountered during the process of gaussian elimination ( ge ) with complete pivoting for an @xmath5 hadamard matrix @xmath3 ( the so called `` growth factor '' for @xmath3 ) . traditionally , backward error analysis for gaussian elimination ( ge ) , see e.g. @xcite , on a matrix @xmath14 $ ] is expressed in terms of the _ growth factor _",
    "@xmath15 which involves all the elements @xmath16 , that occur during the elimination for a choice of pivoting strategy given .",
    "matrices with the property where no row and column exchanges are needed during ge with complete pivoting are called _ completely pivoted _ ( cp ) or feasible . in other words , at each step of the elimination the element of largest magnitude ( the `` pivot '' , denoted by @xmath17 ) is located at the top left position of every appearing submatrix during the process .",
    "if @xmath18 denotes the absolute value of @xmath19 principal minor of @xmath20 , then mathematically @xmath20 being cp means ( or is equivalent to ) that for each @xmath21 , we have that @xmath18 is greater than or equal to the absolute value of any other @xmath19 determinant that includes the first @xmath22 rows and columns .",
    "this is not necessarily the maximum @xmath19 minor of @xmath20 , but only the maximum @xmath19 minor of @xmath20 when its first @xmath22 rows and columns are fixed .    for a cp matrix @xmath20",
    "we have @xmath23 if a matrix is not initially cp , by applying row and column operations with complete pivoting we can always bring it in cp form .",
    "the following lemma gives a useful relation between pivots and minors .",
    "@xcite let @xmath20 be a cp matrix .",
    "the magnitude of the pivots which appear after application of ge operations to @xmath20 is given by @xmath24    in 1969 , cryer @xcite conjectured that if @xmath20 is a real @xmath5 matrix such that @xmath25 then @xmath26 , with equality iff @xmath20 is a hadamard matrix . in 1991",
    "gould @xcite proved that the first part of the conjecture is not true .",
    "he found matrices with growth bigger than their orders .",
    "thus , the following remains open :    * conjecture*(cryer ) the growth of a hadamard matrix is its order .",
    "this conjecture has only been proven for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "great difficulty arises in the study of this problem because @xmath3-equivalence operations do not preserve pivots , i.e. the @xmath3-equivalent matrices do not necessarily have the same pivot pattern . for instance , for @xmath29 there are 34 pivot patterns although there are only 5 equivalence classes of hadamard matrices for this order .",
    "furthermore , many pivot patterns can be observed by permuting the rows and columns of any 20 by 20 hadamard matrix and there are just 3 inequivalent matrices .",
    "however , the existence of d - optimal designs ( and other specific submatrices with concrete determinants ) that exist embedded in a hadamard matrix have provided some clues on the pivot patterns ( see @xcite ) .    a _ d - optimal design of order @xmath4 _ is an @xmath30-matrix having maximal determinant . here and throughout this paper , for convenience , whenever a determinant or minor is mentioned , we mean its absolute value .",
    "the question of finding the determinant of a d - optimal design of order @xmath4 is an old one which remains unanswered in general .    in 1893",
    "hadamard proved in @xcite that for every @xmath31-matrix @xmath32 , @xmath33    we recall that the original interest in hadamard matrices stemmed from the fact that these matrices are the only ones that satisfy equality in ( [ det0 ] ) .",
    "this has led to further study and tighter bounds for the maximal determinant for all @xmath31-matrices of order @xmath34 have been found ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath35 , ehlich in @xcite and independently wojtas in @xcite proved that @xmath36 in order for equality to hold , it is required that there exists a @xmath31-matrix @xmath32 of order @xmath4 such that @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 . here , as usual",
    ", @xmath39 denotes the identity matrix of order @xmath4 , and @xmath40 denotes the @xmath5 matrix all of whose entries are equal to one . in these circumstances , it may be proven that , in addition , @xmath41 is the sum of two squares , a condition which is believed to be sufficient ( order 138 is the lowest for which the question has not been settled yet , @xcite ) .    in the early 90s ,",
    "a surprising link between homological algebra and hadamard matrices @xcite led to the study of cocyclic hadamard matrices @xcite .",
    "hadamard matrices of many types are revealed to be ( equivalent to ) cocyclic matrices @xcite . among them , sylvester hadamard matrices , williamson hadamard matrices , ito hadamard matrices and paley hadamard matrices .",
    "furthermore , the cocyclic construction is the most uniform construction technique for hadamard matrices currently known , and cocyclic hadamard matrices may consequently provide a uniform approach to the famous hadamard conjecture .",
    "the main advantages of the cocyclic framework concerning @xmath1 by @xmath1 hadamard matrices may be summarized in the following facts :    * the test to decide whether a cocyclic matrix is hadamard runs in @xmath42 time , better than the @xmath43 algorithm for usual ( not necessarily cocyclic ) matrices . *",
    "the search space is reduced to the set of cocyclic matrices over a given group ( that is , @xmath44 matrices , provided that a basis for cocycles over @xmath45 consists of @xmath46 generators ) , instead of the whole set of @xmath47 matrices of order @xmath1 with entries in @xmath48 .    in @xcite",
    "was shown that the cocyclic technique can certainly be extended to handle the maximal determinant problem at least when @xmath49 . more concretely , the study focused on cocyclic matrices over the dihedral group of @xmath0 elements with @xmath2 odd .",
    "based on exhaustive and heuristic searches , three algorithms for constructing cocyclic matrices with large determinants were provided .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in embedding ( cocyclic ) submatrices of orders @xmath0 with large determinants in certain cocyclic hadamard matrices of orders @xmath1 .",
    "if these determinants attain the largest possible value , we are embedding d - optimal designs . also , we discuss the relation between the existence of these submatrices and the growth factor for these hadamard matrices .    in section 2 , an algebraic formalism",
    "( in terms of cocycles ) to describe two combinatorial operations on a matrix ( eliminate and add certain rows and columns ) is provided . as a consequence of this formalism",
    "a method arises for embedding ( cocyclic ) submatrices of orders @xmath0 with large determinants in certain cocyclic hadamard matrices of orders @xmath1 . in section 3 , we connect the existence of specific matrices embedded in cocyclic hadamard matrices of order 20 with the values of the pivots that appear when we perform gaussian elimination with complete pivoting on them .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and future work .    * notation . * throughout this paper we use @xmath50 for @xmath9 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "we write @xmath3 for a hadamard matrix and @xmath53 for a d - optimal design of order @xmath54 .",
    "the notation @xmath55 means @xmath53 is embedded in @xmath3 .",
    "assume throughout that @xmath56 is a multiplicative group , not necessarily abelian .",
    "functions @xmath57 which satisfy @xmath58 are called ( binary ) cocycles ( over @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "a cocycle is a coboundary @xmath59 if it is derived from a set mapping @xmath60 by @xmath61    a cocycle @xmath62 is naturally displayed as _ a cocyclic matrix ( or @xmath45-matrix ) _ @xmath63 ; that is , the entry in the @xmath64th position of the cocyclic matrix is @xmath65 , for all @xmath66 .",
    "a cocycle @xmath62 is _ normalized _ if @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "the cocyclic matrix coming from a normalized cocycle is called _ normalized _ as well .",
    "each unnormalized cocycle @xmath62 determines a normalized one @xmath69 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , we may reduce , without loss of generality , to the case of normalized cocycles .    the set of cocycles forms an abelian group @xmath70 under pointwise multiplication , and the coboundaries form a subgroup @xmath71 .",
    "a basis @xmath72 for cocycles over @xmath45 consists of some elementary coboundaries @xmath73 and some representative cocycles , so that every cocyclic matrix admits a unique representation as a hadamard ( pointwise ) product @xmath74 , in terms of some coboundary matrices @xmath75 and a matrix @xmath76 formed from representative cocycles .",
