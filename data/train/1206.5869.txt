    "we would like to have a measurement of the decay chain @xmath6 in which the @xmath7 meson cascading from the @xmath8 is not detected .",
    "it is proposed to measure the missing @xmath7 4-momentum using the measurement of the @xmath9 direction and two mass constraints ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) . the @xmath9 direction is determined from the reconstructed positions of the @xmath12 interaction and the @xmath9 decay vertices .",
    "measured uncertainties on these quantities can be included in a fit with the two mass constraints",
    ".    there could be 2 solutions for the signal and a study based on simulated events may help to choose one of these possibilities .",
    "the amount of background candidates can be decreased using the fit @xmath13 probability .    for signal events ,",
    "as the @xmath8 has a very small intrinsic width , one expects to observe a peak in the @xmath14 mass distribution having a width which depends mainly on the accuracy of tracking capabilities .",
    "the proposed analysis is based on the same charged particles final state which was already measured in lhcb for the channel : @xmath15 .",
    "few selection criteria have to be removed to allow for the missing @xmath7 meson and in particular the condition on the similarity between the directions defined by the two vertices and by the @xmath16 momentum .    analyzing 336 @xmath17 integrated luminosity ,",
    "lhcb has measured @xcite about 6000 @xmath18 decays .",
    "the number of @xmath19 reconstructed events can be estimated by comparing the corresponding branching fractions for the two decay channels .    from @xmath20 symmetry and factorization",
    ", we can simply identify the branching fraction of @xmath21 with the one of the neutral @xmath0 into charged @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the phase space is also very close to the one in the non strange case . in view of the other uncertainties",
    ", we can safely disregard any @xmath20 effect .",
    "this means from the measured case , the one of @xmath24 , @xmath25 where we average the results of belle and babar for the non - strange decays ( babar is presently not published ) .",
    "this value agrees with the theoretical expectation using the heavy quark limit [ @xmath26 , c.f .",
    "( [ nl0plus ] ) ] .",
    "however , using the experimental value for the non - strange decays together with the @xmath20 light flavor symmetry is likely to be better than the result derived in the heavy quark limit and assuming exact factorization .    to assess the soundness of the @xmath20 assumption , let us consider the decays to @xmath27 .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has measured : @xmath28 in this expression we have added in quadrature the different uncertainties quoted in the publication .",
    "the value agrees well , as expected , with the corresponding measurement for the @xmath29 meson . @xmath30    analyzing an integrated luminosity of 1@xmath31",
    ", the lhcb collaboration can thus expect to reconstruct : @xmath32 with the @xmath33 meson reconstructed in the @xmath34 decay channel .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 corresponds to the efficiency of the additional cuts which have to be applied to select the events .",
    "a very few hundred of events are expected and the signal visibility will thus depend mainly on the mass resolution for the @xmath14 system and on the combinatorial background level .    * *",
    "we propose an experimental study of the @xmath36 decays that would provide us with an important verification of the observations made in the corresponding non - strange modes .",
    "furthermore it would allow us to elucidate the problem of small value of @xmath37 .",
    "if a really unexpected value for @xmath38 is found , this could mean that    * either we are mistaken in the theoretical evaluation of @xmath37 , which would be very surprising in view of good consistency of several approaches , or the @xmath39 corrections are exceedingly large in the @xmath40 case , * or the narrow @xmath41-states situated below the @xmath42 thresholds are not the  @xmath43 \" states with @xmath40 ( ree ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "both these possibilities do not seem plausible to us .",
    "the remaining uncertainty on the theoretical side could be significantly reduced by the lattice study of the @xmath44 transition form factors at finite heavy quark masses .",
    "if the expected rate is confirmed , that would set beyond doubt the theoretical estimates of small values for @xmath37 and it would confirm the assignment of the @xmath41 states . a strong suspicion would be confirmed against the semileptonic measurements or identifications of resonances performed in the non - strange case .      even if the answer of the proposed experiment is in agreement with theoretical expectations made by adopting the  @xmath43 \" assignment to the @xmath45 states",
    ", it will still not give us the full explanation to the problems observed in the non - strange case .",
    "the problems encountered on the experimental side , especially in semileptonic non - strange decays , remain to be understood : the origin of the discrepancy between belle and babar ; why so large apparent rates for decay to @xmath46 ?",
    "a theoretical explanation for the large number of events in the non - strange semileptonic decay is missing .",
    "the observed excess of events in @xmath47 ( around @xmath48 ) and in @xmath49 , that in our opinion are not the lowest @xmath40 or @xmath50 states , needs an explanation .",
    "such events should have their counterpart in non - leptonic decays . to test an excess in the @xmath51 channel",
    ", a study of the decay @xmath52 at lhcb would be very welcome .",
    "to the first radial excitation of the @xmath53 within the same approach as for the orbital excitations above  @xcite , in the heavy quark limit , we find a very small number with respect to the decay to the ground states , @xmath54 .",
    "this is because the corresponding isgur - wise function is very small , reaching its maximum at @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "such a small number agrees with the findings made by using lattice qcd at @xmath57 close to @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the non - leptonic decay should then also be small .",
    "this seems to discard the radial excitation interpretation of the remaining events . ]",
