    "the @xmath0 annihilation at low energies , below 3 gev , is the main source of information on the properties of the light vector mesons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and their excited states",
    ". other important application of the @xmath0 annihilation is calculation of the hadronic contribution into the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xmath4 and the running electromagnetic constant .",
    "the difference between the measured value of @xmath5  @xcite and recent standard model calculations  @xcite varies from 3.2 to 3.4 sigma .",
    "currently the hadronic leading - order contribution into @xmath5 is dominant source of uncertainty of the standard model @xmath5 prediction .",
    "it is evaluated using experimental data on @xmath0 annihilation via dispersion integral @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ratio of the total cross section of the @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons to the @xmath8 cross section , and @xmath9 is the kernel function decreasing monotonically as approximately @xmath10 .",
    "due to such @xmath11-dependence of @xmath9 the main contribution into @xmath4 comes from the low energy region .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows the contributions of the different @xmath0 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "the new software trigger , improvement in the offline background filter , and more accurate calculation of the luminosity were introduced , leading to decrease of systematic error .",
    "a bias in the evaluation on the trigger correction for the published analysis of 2001 data was found which affects at the low @xmath12 mass region .",
    "the 0.7% decrease of the predicted cross section for bhabha scattering used for normalization , also was found . the updated 2001 @xmath13 cross section and the preliminary 2002 cross section",

    "the decay reveals itself as interference pattern in the cross section energy dependence .",
    "the process was studied in the two final states : @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in both modes",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the relative interference amplitude were measured .",
    "the obtained interference parameters and @xmath22 branching fraction agree with the results of the previous snd measurement  @xcite but have better accuracy . from the ratio of the @xmath20 cross sections measured in the two different final states , the ratio of the @xmath2 branching fractions was obtained : @xmath25 .",
    "the kloe result has accuracy better than the world average value ( @xmath26 ) and differs from it by 2 standard deviations .",
