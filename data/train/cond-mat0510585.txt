    "the study of radiation - induced defects in carbon nanostructures have become considerably important since the recent experimental results of room - temperature magnetic ordering in proton - irradiated graphite , which exclude metal impurities@xcite , as well as the observation of ferromagnetism in pressure - induced polymerized fullerenes @xcite .",
    "magnetic ordering in defective graphite and fullerenes have been also predicted theoretically@xcite , suggesting the possibility to realize nanoscale magnets with potential applications in spintronics and biocompatible magnetic materials . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetism in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) appears to be more complex than graphite and fullerenes owing the curvature , chirality and different electronic characteristics of the tubes .",
    "single - walled cnts , which are typically 10    in diameter , can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the way that a graphene sheet is rolled up , which is characterized by the chiral indices ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "metallic tubes occur if @xmath2 is divisible by 3 , otherwise the tubes are semiconducting @xcite .",
    "tubes with indices ( @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath4 ) are termed @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , which is related to the arrangement of carbon atoms around the tube .",
    "experimental knowledge concerning defect - induced magnetism in cnts is still lacking .",
    "the difficult to measure magnetic ordering in nanotube samples resides in the presence of metal catalysts which are necessary to produce single - walled tubes .",
    "theoretical investigations on open ended zigzag nanotubes are found to exhibit energetically favorable ferromagnetic spin configurations which are associated to unsaturated dangling bonds at zigzag edges@xcite .",
    "single vacancies in small - diameters cnts , ranging from 4 to 8   , have been recently addressed by first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "although relative high concentrations of vacancy or small supercell sizes containing a vacancy have been considered in this work , it shows that only metallic nanotubes with a single vacancy in their ground state equilibrium geometries would exhibit ferromagnetism .",
    "the calculations were performed in the framework of the spin - polarized density functional theory @xcite , using a basis set of strictly - localized numerical pseudoatomic orbitals as implemented in the siesta code @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy is calculated within the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "standard norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite in their separable form @xcite are used to describe the electron - ion interaction .",
    "we use a double-@xmath7 singly - polarized basis set .",
    "we study the vacancies in both armchair and zigzag cnts with different diameters .",
    "the armchair cnts have chiral indices of ( 6,6 ) and ( 8,8 ) , whereas the zigzag ones have indices of ( 10,0 ) and ( 14,0 ) . for the ( 6,6 ) and ( 10,0 ) cnts",
    "which have diameters of about 8   , we use unit cells containing 120 atoms . for the ( 8,8 ) and ( 14,0 ) cnts with diameters of about 11   , the supercells contain 160 and 168 atoms , respectively . for both 8 and 11",
    "diameter cnts the supercell has a length of @xmath8   .",
    "this means that we are calculating one defect every 13    of cnt length . for the brillouin zone sampling we use six _",
    "k _ points along the cnt axis @xcite . to ensure negligible interaction between tubes we imposed a vacuum region of 12   . with the above supercells , the distance between vacancy images along the tube axis is about 13   .",
    "this means that we are simulating a cnt with a linear concentration of defects with one defect every 13    of cnt length .",
    "a longer supercell with length of @xmath9    are also consider to study the effect a lower defect density in the cnt electronic structure . to do that we use ( 6,6 ) and ( 10,0 ) nanotubes in supercell containing up to 240 atoms and the @xmath10 point for the bz sampling .",
    "the positions of all atoms in the nanotubes were relaxed using the conjugated gradient algorithm until the force components become smaller than 0.05  ev/@xmath11 .",
    "figures  1(a ) and 1(b ) show respectively the equilibrium geometries of the ( 6,6 ) and ( 10,0 ) cnts containing the monovacancy ( hereafter referred to as ( 6,6)+1v and ( 10,0)+1v ) .",

    "we also find metastable configurations for ( 6,6)+1v and ( 10,0)+1v , 10.5 and 12.1  mev / atom higher in energy that their respective ground state ( gs ) geometries . in these configurations",
    "the pentagon structure plus the twofold coordinated c atom are also found but rotated clockwise about @xmath12 with respect to the equilibrium geometries .",
    "a third metastable structure is found for ( 10,0)+1v , which is 17.2  mev / atom higher in energy than the gs geometry . here",
    ", the c atoms neighboring to the vacancy do not form bond , remaining twofold coordinated .",
    "this geometry is known as @xmath13 ( three dangling bonds ) structure .",

    "the metastable geometries of ( 8,8)+1v and ( 14,0)+1v are 7.3 and 6.7  mev / atom higher in energy that the respective gs geometries .",
    "the smaller energy difference with respect to the 8    diameter cnts is attributed to a decrease in the strain energy due to the lower curvature of the ( 14,0 ) and ( 8,8 ) tubes .",
    "thus , extrapolating to higher - diameter tubes , we can infer that the metastable geometries would tend to disappear .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath13 metastable structure of ( 10,0)+1v is not found in ( 14,0)+1v , suggesting that the @xmath13 geometry exits due to the higher strain in the ( 10,0 ) tube , hindering further relaxations .",

    "the above suggests a minor influence between images vacancies for supercell with lengths up to @xmath2213   . for the vacancy in cnts of 11    of diameter",

    "the lower - energy structures of ( 6,6)+1v and ( 10,0)+1v have magnetic moments of 0.82 and 0.32  @xmath0 , respectively , whereas for the metastable configuration the magnetic moment are closer to 1  @xmath0 . clearly , the magnetism is due to the under - coordinated c atom which has a localized unpaired spin , as shown in fig .  2 .",

    "the isosurfaces correspond to a charge of 0.015 @xmath23/@xmath24.,width=264 ]    however , as a c atom with a dangling bond has a magnetic moment of 1  @xmath0 , the lower magnetic moments found in ( 6,6)+1v and ( 10,0)+1v are due to a redistribution of charge around the defect .",
    "this can be checked by looking at the equilibrium distance between the c atoms that form the pentagon structure , shown in table  i. as longer this distance is , larger is the magnetic moment .",
    "this means that once a vacancy is created , two of the three dangling bonds containing a spin rehybridize forming the pentagon structure .",
    "the weakness of this bond depend on the curvature strain of the tube .",
    "an extreme case occurs in the @xmath13 configuration of ( 10,0)+1v . here",
    "no bond between the under - coordinated c atoms is formed , resulting in three dangling bonds with magnetic moment of 1.4  @xmath0 .",
    "considering lower concentration of vacancies , that is doubling the supercell length , we find that magnetic moments on ( 6,6)+1v and ( 10,0)+1v are 0.63 and 0.49  @xmath0 , respectively . thus , the magnetic moment tend to stabilize approximately around the average value 0.6  @xmath0 for more diluted monovacancy concentrations .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the tubes with higher diameters where the magnetic moment on ( 8,8)+1v and ( 14,0)+1v are 0.77 and 0.53  @xmath0 , respectively . this stabilization appears to be related to a decrease in the strain energy on the tube surface .",
