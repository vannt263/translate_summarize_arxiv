    "@xcite quantum gates are the key components for quantum information processing in an analogue to the classical gates for classical information processing",
    ". to design deterministic quantum gates , three types of interactions can be exploited , i.e. , photon - photon interactions , @xcite spin - spin interactions , @xcite and photon - spin interactions .",
    "@xcite although photons do not interact directly with each other intrinsically , photon - photon indirect interactions mediated by cavity qed have been demonstrated but are by definition non - linear phenomena . for high photon - photon gate fidelity",
    "it is thus necessary to carefully control the shapeof the overlapping photon wavepackets to be top hat profiles .",
    "direct spin - spin interactions suffer from short range distance . among the three types of interactions , the photon - spin interactions via optical transitions are the strongest and",
    "can be easily configured to mediate photon - photon and spin - spin ( indirect ) interactions for making various quantum gates with high speed .    exploiting the cavity - qed enhanced photon - spin interactions , in our previous work we proposed two types of photon - spin entangling gates consisting of a single charged qd in an optical micro- or nano - cavity for both quantum and classical information processing with high speed ( tens to hundreds ghz ) as well as for spin memory with heralded feature and unity efficiency .",
    "@xcite the two types of photon - spin entangling gates are based on the giant optical faraday rotation(gfr ) and giant optical circular birefringence(gcb ) , which are induced by the single qd - confined spin in the cavity .",
    "gfr and gcb are manifested as large differences in the phase or amplitude of reflection / transmission coefficients between two circular polarizations of the input photons .",
    "both phenomena can be regarded as the macroscopic imprint of the optical spin selection rules of the charged excitons in qds .",
    "however , in our previous work , the concepts of gfr and gcb were introduced in the weak - excitation approximation where the input field is in the low - power limit , and they can be regarded as the optical linear effects being independent of input power . in this work ,",
    "we investigate how gfr and gcb can be extended from the weak excitation approximation to the semiclassical approximation where the qd saturation effects induced by the input field are taken into account .",
    "an analytical method in the semiclassical approximation is adopted in comparison with the numerical calculations by the quantum optics toolbox .",
    "@xcite    we find that the semiclassical approximation can be used not only in the low- and high- power regime , but also in a non - saturation window around the cavity resonance in the strong coupling regime at intermediate powers where the high cavity reflectivity leads to a higher saturation threshold .",
    "this higher saturation threshold leads to the retention of the linear effects into the intermediate power regime around the cavity resonance . at frequencies close to the dressed state resonances ,",
    "however , gfr and gcb become power dependent at lower powers and saturates earlier .",
    "similar low power saturation occurs in the purcell regime where there is no dressed state splitting .",
    "the quantum gates based on the phase shifts(gfr ) or reflection / transmission(gcb ) around the cavity resonance are thus much less vulnerable to input power fluctuations .",
