    "a quark - gluon deconfinement phenomenological order parameter was first introduced in the vector channel , and in the framework of thermal qcd sum rules in @xcite .",
    "it is given by the squared energy threshold , @xmath1 , for the onset of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in the hadronic spectral function .",
    "in general , around @xmath2 , the resonances in the spectrum , in any channel , will be either no longer present or will become very broad . when the temperature approaches the critical value for deconfinement , @xmath3 , one would expect hadrons to disappear from the spectral function , leading to a description based entirely on pqcd .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath1 in the vector channel is a decreasing function of the temperature , together with the coupling of the @xmath4-meson to the vector current .",
    "this analysis , however , was performed only in the zero - width approximation .",
    "resonance broadening was proposed in @xcite-@xcite , and subsequently confirmed in other applications @xcite , as an important phenomenological information for the deconfinement transition .",
    "qcd sum rules in the axial - vector channel , @xcite , established a link between deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration at finite temperature .",
    "this discussion was improved later in @xcite , and recently updated and extended also to finite density in @xcite .",
    "these analyses indicate that the temperature at which @xmath1 vanishes is very close to that at which the quark condensate vanishes .",
    "the results suggest that both phase transitions take place at roughly the same temperature .",
    "the analyses of @xcite , @xcite-@xcite made use of the finite energy qcd sum rule ( fesr ) of the lowest dimension ( @xmath5 ) in the axial - vector channel , assuming full saturation of the hadronic spectral function by the pion pole .",
    "this assumption is not justified if one were to consider the next two fesr of dimension @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , already at @xmath8 one finds that the values of the condensates of dimension @xmath6 and @xmath7 that follow from the second and third fesr are barely consistent with results obtained from experimental data @xcite .",
    "this suggests the presence of additional hadronic contributions .",
    "in fact , the data in this channel include also the @xmath0 resonance .    using the first three fesr , we will reconsider the light - quark axial - vector channel using a hadronic spectral function involving the pion pole as well as the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "we will obtain information on the temperature behavior of the @xmath0 coupling and hadronic width .",
    "the results show that @xmath1 vanishes at a critical temperature some 10% below that for chiral - symmetry restoration .",
    "this difference is not relevant within the accuracy of the method .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling initially increases with increasing @xmath9 up to @xmath10 , and then decreases sharply up to @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the hadronic width of the @xmath0 remains constant up to @xmath11 , increasing sharply thereafter .",
    "these behaviours are consistent with a quark - gluon deconfinement scenario .",
    "we consider the correlator of light - quark axial - vector currents @xmath13 & = & -g_{\\mu\\nu}\\ , \\pi_1(q^2 ) + q_\\mu q_\\nu\\ , \\pi_0(q^2 )   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the ( charged ) axial - vector current , and @xmath15 is the four - momentum carried by the current .",
    "concentrating on e.g. @xmath16 and invoking the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances , one has @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a renormalization scale , the wilson coefficients @xmath21 depend on the lorentz indexes and quantum numbers of the currents , and on the local gauge invariant operators @xmath22 built from the quark and gluon fields .",
    "the wilson coefficients are calculable in pqcd .",
    "the unit operator above has dimension @xmath23 and @xmath24 stands for the purely perturbative contribution .",
    "the dimension @xmath6 term , a renormalization group invariant quantity , is given by @xmath25 where the second term is negligible in comparison with the gluon condensate .",
    "the leading power correction of dimension @xmath7 is the four - quark condensate . in the vacuum saturation approximation",
    "it becomes @xmath26 having a mild dependence on the renormalization scale .",
    "this approximation has no theoretical justification .",
    "hence , there is no reliable way of estimating corrections , which appear to be rather large from comparisons between eq .",
    "( [ c6 ] ) and determinations from data @xcite .",
    "this poses no problem for the finite temperature analysis , where eq.([c6 ] ) is only used to normalize results at @xmath8 , and one is interested in the behavior of ratios .",
    "cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy @xmath27-plane , leads us to the fesr ( at leading order in pqcd ) @xmath28 & - &   \\frac{s_0^n}{n } \\left[1+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\alpha_s)\\right ] \\ ; ( n=1,2,\\cdots ) .\\label{fesr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the normalization of the correlator in pqcd is @xmath29\\;. \\label{norm}\\ ] ] at @xmath8 the radiative corrections above are known up to five - loop order , i.e. @xmath30 , in pqcd .",
    "higher dimensional condensates are poorly known @xcite and will not be considered here .    in the hadronic sector",
    "the spectral function involves the pion pole followed by the @xmath0 resonance @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xcite is the pion decay constant and the pion mass has been neglected .",
    "we have made a fit to the aleph data @xcite ( at t=0 ) ; for details , see @xcite .",
    "this fit together with the aleph data is shown in fig.1 up to @xmath33 ( the fesr determine @xmath34 ) .",
    "the pion decay constant is related to the quark condensate through the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath35 chiral corrections to this relation are at the 5% level @xcite . at finite temperature deviations are negligible except very close to the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "+ the first three fesr can now be used to determine the pqcd threshold @xmath36 , and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 condensates .",
    "these results will be used to normalize all finite temperature results .",
    "the value of @xmath36 obtained by saturating the hadronic spectral function with only the pion pole , and to leading order in pqcd , is @xmath37 , as in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this value increases to @xmath38 once the @xmath0 contribution is taken into account , and becomes @xmath39 with pqcd to five - loop order .",
    "the extension of the qcd sum rule method to finite temperature implies a @xmath9-dependence in the ope , as well as in the hadronic parameters .",
    "the wilson coefficients and the vacuum condensates become temperature dependent .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath41 now depends on two scales , the ordinary qcd scale @xmath42 associated with the momentum transfer , and the critical temperature scale @xmath3 associated with temperature .",
    "this poses no problems in the asymptotic freedom region and at very high temperatures , @xmath43 , where pqcd can be applied .",
    "however , the qcd sum rule method approaches @xmath3 from below , so that the presence of this second scale is problematic .",
    "no satisfactory solution to this problem exists , so that analyses must be carried out at leading order in pqcd . at this order in pqcd",
    "there are two thermal corrections to eq.([norm ] ) . in the time - like region ( @xmath44 )",
    ", we have the annihilation term which in the static limit ( @xmath45 ) is @xmath46\\;.\\ ] ] in the space - like region we have the scattering term , which is associated to a cut centered at the origin on the real axis in the complex energy @xmath47-plane of width @xmath48 @xcite . in the static limit this is given by @xmath49 & = & \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\ ; t^2 \\ , \\delta(\\omega^2)\\ ; , \\label{st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the fermi thermal function , and the chiral limit was assumed .",
    "these perturbative results are valid for @xmath51 at the one - loop level in qcd , so that temperature effects develop smoothly from their @xmath8 values .",
    "non - perturbative contributions will be added later in the framework of the ope .    in the hadronic sector and at finite temperature ,",
    "masses , couplings , and widths become @xmath9-dependent .",
    "hadronically stable particles , e.g. the pion , with @xmath52 develop a width",
    ". the important parameters signaling deconfinement are the hadronic width and coupling , but not the mass .",
    "a vanishing mass at @xmath53 would not signal deconfinement , unless the width diverges at such a temperature .",
    "but then the value of the mass becomes irrelevant .",
    "this is actually what qcd sum rule analyses show @xcite .",
    "a notable exception are the scalar , pseudoscalar , and vector charm - anti - charm states which survive beyond @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the temperature behavior of the quark condensate , equivalently @xmath54 , was obtained , in the chiral limit , in the framework of the schwinger - dyson equation @xcite , and for finite quark masses from a fit to lattice qcd results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath55 . in this temperature region",
    "the quark condensate in the chiral limit is essentially the same as that for finite quark masses .",

    "the fesr have solutions for the three parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , up to @xmath64 , a temperature at which @xmath1 reaches its minimum .",
    "an inspection of eq.([fesrt1 ] ) shows that disregarding the @xmath0 contribution , @xmath1 would vanish at a lower critical temperature than @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) . making the rough approximation of neglecting the thermal factor @xmath67 in the second term on the r.h.s . of eq.([fesrt1 ] ) leads to @xmath68 .",

    "the behavior of the width is shown in fig.[figure5 ] , and that of the coupling in fig.[figure6 ] .",
