    "the study of @xmath0-jet production at high energies is of great interest to test the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the presence of a heavy @xmath0 quark ( @xmath2 , @xmath3  asymptotic scale parameter of qcd ) guarantees a large momentum transfer that keeps the strong - coupling constant small @xmath4 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the modulus of the @xmath0-quark transverse momentum @xmath5 , so that it is justified to work in massless approximation and to assume beauty to be an active flavor in the proton .",

    ", the contributions to the production cross section from subprocesses involving @xmath1-channel exchanges of partons ( gluons and quarks ) may become dominant .",
    "then , the off - shell properties of the incoming partons can no longer be neglected , and @xmath1-channel partons become reggeized . they can be described in quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) approach  @xcite , based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons ( @xmath9 )  @xcite and quarks ( @xmath10 )  @xcite . in qmrk ,",
    "the particles ( multi - regge ) or groups of particles ( quasi - multi - regge ) produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity . for the inclusive @xmath0-jet production",
    ", this implies that a single @xmath0 quark is produced in the central region of rapidity , while other particles , including a @xmath11 quark , are produced at large rapidities . in the case of @xmath12 pair and @xmath13",
    "associated production in the central rapidity region , we also assume that there are no other particles in this region , so that these particles are considered as quasi - multi - regge pairs . in the presented work we continue our investigation and acknowledge the results obtained in refs.@xcite@xcite .",

    "using the effective vertex of the concerned transition given by @xcite , the squared amplitude of concerning subprocess is found to be @xmath18  @xcite .    at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the qmrk approach ,",
    "the main contribution to inclusive @xmath0-quark production arises from the partonic subprocess @xmath19 , where the @xmath0 and @xmath11 quarks are produced close in rapidity .",
    "the contributions due to the other nlo processes , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are suppressed because , in the small-@xmath23 region , the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the reggeized gluon greatly exceeds the relevant reggeized quark pdfs .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , the preliminary cdf data @xcite are compared with our predictions obtained in the qmrk approach . the contributions due to lo and nlo subprocesses are shown separately . since the lower bound of the @xmath26 integration is zero , we allow for the @xmath0-quark mass to be finite , @xmath27  gev .",

    "it nicely agrees with the cdf data throughout the entire @xmath30 range .",
    "the data measured by the cdf collaboration on inclusive @xmath31-dijet production cross section @xcite come as distributions in transverse energy @xmath32 of the leading - jet ( jet with the maximal transverse energy ) , the dijet invariant mass @xmath33 , and the azimuthal separation angle @xmath34 . they are compared with our qmrk predictions including the contributions from subprocesses @xmath24 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , in fig .

    "the second mechanism of prompt photon production is the fragmentation of the produced partons into photons , which can be described by the perturbative fragmentation functions  @xcite . in this case",
