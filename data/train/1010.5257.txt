    "one of the many stellar overdensities detected in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data is the so - called `` anticenter stream '' ( acs ) unveiled by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g06 ) using matched - filter star counts .",
    "the acs feature is seen as a well - defined swath of stellar excess near the galactic anticenter at moderately low latitudes 18@xmath11 35@xmath1 ( at roughly constant right ascension , @xmath12 125@xmath1 ) , spanning the full @xmath1065@xmath1 declination coverage of the sdss database in this region . discovered distinct , well - separated narrow `` tributaries '' or sub - streams within the broad acs stream ; these tributaries are thought to be dynamically distinct components among the remnants of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "* hereafter gcm08 ) measured radial velocities in two fields along the acs , and identified the radial velocity signature of the stream . the relatively large measured velocity dispersion for the northernmost of the two fields ( acs - b ;",
    "@xmath13 km s@xmath4 ) is consistent with the dispersion for a tidal remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy , but may also result from the sampling of more than one of the apparent cold sub - streams within the broader acs . for the second field ,",
    "acs - c , about 23@xmath1 south of acs - b , found a dispersion of only @xmath105 km s@xmath4 , suggesting that their data in this field sample only one of the kinematically cold `` tributaries '' making up the larger system .",
    "the mean velocities in each field , combined with sdss / usno - b proper motions and the locations of stream overdensities , were used by to fit an orbit and show that the acs corresponds to debris lost from an object on a low - inclination , nearly circular , prograde orbit .",
    "this orbit succeeds in reproducing not only the broad swath cut by the acs stream in the sdss footprint , but also suggests that the `` eastern banded structure '' ( ebs ) pointed out by at ( @xmath14 , @xmath15)@xmath16 is associated with the acs as debris from a subsequent ( or prior ) orbital wrap of the same system .",
    "the stellar overdensity in this region of the sdss database was identified by @xcite as being associated with the monoceros ( mon ) ring , a set of features first reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that seem to form a low - latitude ringlike structure over a large area near the galactic anticenter .",
    "however , once the smoothly - varying background has been removed the anticenter stream appears to be a separate narrow stream structure , rather than a part of the much larger monoceros feature .",
    "nevertheless , because many detected overdensities in this region of sky have been attributed to monoceros , we will compare our acs findings to existing monoceros data .",
    "based on its narrow radial extent and low velocity dispersion , @xcite argued that mon was the remnant of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite followed up with photometric detections spanning @xmath10100@xmath1 , and suggested that the apparent ring was a result of flaring or warping of the galactic disk .",
    "evidence of a rather thin radial extent based on main - sequence width @xcite as well as apparent separation from the edge of the galactic disk @xcite favor an accretion origin for the ring .",
    "these facts were taken by @xcite along with their measured radial velocity trend with longitude to be consistent with a dynamically young tidal stream on a clearly non - circular orbit ( though with low eccentricity ) .",
    "low - latitude , torus - like features are produced by accretion of satellites on nearly - circular orbits roughly coplanar with the galactic disk in @xmath17 cdm simulations @xcite , and are also visible in the extragalactic systems imaged by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted that a few galactic globular clusters may be associated with the monoceros ring in both position and radial velocity  a point that was further developed by @xcite to include 11 old open clusters that are also near the monoceros plane .",
    "@xcite have continued to map the extent and stellar populations of the ring , and have detected overdensities both above and below the galactic plane , ruling out a warp or flare of the disk as the origin of the feature .",
    "however , recent simulations @xcite have shown that interactions of massive subhalos with the galactic disk can form ringlike features that result from excitation of thin / thick disk stars . on the other hand , recent high - resolution abundance analysis by @xcite has shown that monoceros stars have chemical abundance patterns similar to those of milky way dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) and unlike stars from the outer milky way disk ( chou et al . , _ in prep . _ ) , bolstering the case for a tidal origin for mon . further detailed chemodynamical studies of stream stars are clearly needed to assess the origin of this feature and its possible association with the acs .",
    "monoceros has been modeled as debris from a tidally disrupting dwarf galaxy by both @xcite and @xcite , both of whose models were constrained so that the progenitor reproduces the putative canis major dwarf galaxy ( which was discovered by @xcite ; but cf .",
    "@xcite for alternative explanations of this apparent stellar overdensity ) .",
    "the @xcite models incorporated all detections of suspected monoceros debris known at the time , and reproduced the known structure with a disrupting dwarf galaxy on a low - inclination , nearly - circular prograde orbit .",
    "subsequent mapping of the extent and stellar populations of the ring have yet to be incorporated into the models , and to date only a few kinematical constraints have been derived ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the only proper motion results for monoceros debris , measured by @xcite in sa 71 , produced an orbit in agreement with the @xcite determination .",
    "this sa 71 study illustrated the difficulty of studying low - latitude features ",
    "large numbers of accurate proper motions supplemented by radial velocities were necessary to distinguish the kinematical signature of mon from the overlapping kinematics of galactic populations .      here , we present a follow - up to the study , supplementing the radial velocities from that previous work with substantially more measurements from wiyn+hydra spectroscopy as well as accurate proper motions in one of the fields studied there .",
    "this field , acs - c , was originally selected because it coincides with sa 76 , one region from the deep proper motion study in kapteyn s selected areas ( sas ) by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cd06 ) . from the newly - obtained spectra ,",
    "additional likely radial velocity members of the acs are identified and used to derive the mean absolute proper motion ( and thus 3-d kinematics ) of stream stars along this line of sight .",
    "this represents one of the most precise absolute proper motions yet derived for a milky way stellar tidal stream .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows :  2 gives an overview of the proper motion and spectroscopic data for sa 76 and their handling , including details of both the astrometric and spectroscopic data reduction .",
    "the selection of anticenter stream members is detailed in  3 .",
    "initially , candidates were selected based on broad radial velocity criteria . additional culling of the sample was performed based on reduced proper motions . in  4 , we present metallicities for stars selected to be acs members , comparing our results to the expected [ fe / h ] distribution of foreground stellar populations selected from the besanon galaxy model .",
    "section 5 discusses the measured kinematics based on our final sample of anticenter stream debris candidates .",
    "the mean radial velocity and absolute proper motions yield a low - inclination , nearly - circular orbit for acs debris in sa 76 .",
    "the mean 3-d space motion we find for sa 76 acs candidates is oriented at a @xmath18 angle to the prominently visible anticenter stream .",
    "some possible explanations for this are discussed in  6  we believe that the motions we have measured represent a kinematically distinct substream from within the more extensive acs system .",
    "finally , we compare our results to known characteristics of the monoceros ring in  7 .",
    "from the available data , the acs appears to be unrelated to monoceros , but this remains unclear .",

    "three overlapping fields from poss - i were used , each including one red ( 103a - d + rp2444 ) and one blue ( 103a - o , no filter ) plate .",

    "the uncertainty in the correction to absolute proper motions is between 0.41 and 0.45 mas  yr@xmath4 in each dimension for both the east and west fields .",

    "good seeing ( @xmath41 ) and clear skies on both the december 2007 and november 2008 observing runs allowed observation of the majority of faint targets within the selection . typically 60 - 70 targets were placed on hydra fibers , with the remaining 15 - 20 fibers placed on blank sky regions to allow for accurate sky subtraction .",

    "these rv standard spectra were first cross - correlated against each other using the iraf tool fxcor to determine the accuracy of the velocities and remove any outliers ( i.e. those that yield unreasonable cross - correlation results due to some defect , such as a poorly - removed cosmic ray ) . measured velocities of the rv standards typically agreed with published iau standard values to within 1 - 2 km s@xmath4 .",

    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : vhel_hist ] shows measured heliocentric radial velocities for all 224 stars in the sa 76 sample .",

    "serves to smooth over finite sampling statistics from within each model population and reduce the noise in the predicted distributions . for comparison to our measured rvs",
    ", we overlay in figure  [ fig : vhel_hist ] ( as a filled histogram ) an rv distribution taken from the combined realizations of the besanon galaxy model , scaled to match the total number of stars observed .",
    "the model distribution was limited to the magnitude and color ranges of our target selection ( 0.2@xmath350.6 and 18.5@xmath34 20.0 ) to sample the same foreground / background populations ( we note that this is the same comparison done by , but with additional measured rvs ) .",
    "the peak and dispersion of the observed rvs match the model distribution fairly well , but with an additional peak prominently visible at @xmath4790 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this peak has already been identified by gcm08 ( though using far fewer rv measurements ) as being due to acs stream stars .",
    "acs candidates are initially selected using all stars with 65@xmath48125 km  s@xmath4 ( to ensure that all possible stream members are included )  a total of 87 stars . stars within this rv selection",
    "are shown as solid triangles in the right - hand panels of figures  [ fig : cmd_targetselect ] and [ fig : vpd_targetselect ] .",
    "many of the stars thus selected are concentrated along the apparent main sequence of the acs population in the sdss cmd , and are also more tightly clumped in the vpd than the general galactic populations .",
    "because the acs velocity peak overlaps the galactic distribution , however , a selection of acs candidates based solely on rvs will contain some contamination from foreground ( and background ) milky way stars .",
    "initially , we remove all stars having proper motions @xmath49 mas  yr@xmath4 in either dimension .",
    "such proper motions imply extremely large ( @xmath50 500 km  s@xmath4 ) tangential velocities if these stars are at distances @xmath1010 kpc .",
    "thus most of the stars removed on this basis are nearby , high proper - motion milky way disk stars .",
    "examination of the remaining sample of stars in a cmd ( right panel of figure  [ fig : cmd_targetselect ] ) shows no obvious collection of bright ( @xmath51 ) stars with a narrowly - defined rgb locus representing an evolved counterpart to the well - defined msto .",
    "therefore , to distentangle co - moving stream members from foreground / background milky way stars , we turn to the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ) . reduced proper motion , first used extensively by luyten ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is defined as @xmath52 log @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is apparent magnitude in a given bandpass ( we will use sdss @xmath55 magnitudes hereafter ) , and @xmath56 is the total proper motion in arcsec yr@xmath4 . because the tangential velocity @xmath57 ( km  s@xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is in pc and @xmath56 in arcsec yr@xmath4 ) , the reduced proper motion @xmath60 is analogous to an absolute magnitude for stars of a common motion , and virtually independent of distance . substituting terms and using the definition of absolute @xmath55 magnitude , one finds that @xmath61 log @xmath62 . since we know the expected color - magnitude locus for a given population , the reduced proper motion diagram ( @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 ) can be used to identify objects with similar tangential velocities .",
    "the rpmd for all objects measured on at least five plates ( to ensure well - measured proper motions ) is shown in figure  [ fig : gr_rpmd ] .",
    "the left panel shows all well - measured objects . in the right panel , all spectroscopic targets are depicted with open ( grey ) squares , with solid symbols representing stars within the initial rv selection .",
    "stars in the rv - selected sample with red ( 0.5 @xmath65 0.9 ) colors and having reduced proper motion inconsistent with that expected for the acs main sequence and giant branch were first removed from the sample ; these are depicted as filled green triangles in figure  [ fig : gr_rpmd ] .",
    "it is apparent in this plot that the remaining rv - selected candidates separate into two groupings that resemble msto features at blue ( 0.2@xmath350.5 ) colors at reduced proper motions of 11 @xmath66 12.5 and 12.5 @xmath66 14.5 .",
    "these groups were separated into a `` lower '' ( shown as solid blue squares in figures  [ fig : gr_rpmd ] and [ fig : vpd_rpmdsel ] ) and an `` upper '' ( filled red diamonds ) rpmd sample , and examined to see whether there are two populations at distinct @xmath67 within our rv selection . the upper rpmd sample is tightly clumped in the proper motion vector point diagram ( figure  [ fig : vpd_rpmdsel ] , red filled squares ) , while the lower rpmd sample shows considerable scatter inconsistent with a common - motion stellar population at 10 kpc .",
    "because of the wide dispersion in their proper motions , we surmise that the lower rpmd sample is neither acs debris nor any comoving , spatially localized structure ; we thus remove all of these stars from the sample of acs candidates .    among this sample ( red filled diamonds in figure  [ fig : vpd_rpmdsel ] )",
    "there remain some outliers well outside the proper motion clump .",
    "these were examined to assess their membership in the stream .",
    "proper motions in equatorial coordinates are shown for the entire rv - selected sample as a function of @xmath55 magnitude and @xmath68 color in figure  [ fig : mu_gmag_gr_targetselect ] . if the brightest , reddest stars in the initial sample selection are red giants or subgiants associated with the acs , they should have tightly clumped proper motions at the same mean pm as the msto stars ( especially when one considers that the brighter stars should have more precise proper motion measurements ) .",
    "the contrary is true , however  bright , red stars exhibit much _ more _ scatter in both proper motion dimensions than the tightly - clumped faint main sequence stars . because this work is focused on measuring the mean motion of the stream , and not necessarily identifying every possible member , and because no obvious rgb population of the acs is seen , all stars with @xmath51 were removed from the final set of pm candidates . to retain only well - measured stars , those stars measured on fewer than five of the 15 plates",
    "were also culled from the sample , leaving a total of 31 rather secure acs members , based on all available information .",
    "these are confined to a thin , well - defined msto in the cmd of figure  [ fig : full_cmd ] ( left panel ) , which corresponds to the obvious main sequence visible in the right panel .",
    "this panel shows all stars from sdss dr7 in this field of view , with two isochrones from @xcite for old ( 10 gyr ) , metal - poor ( [ fe / h]=-0.9 and [ fe / h]=-1.3 ; chosen to be close to the median metallicities found for acs members in  4 ) populations at 10 kpc , the distance we adopt for the acs .",
    "the isochrones were also corrected for the mean reddening @xmath19 @xcite in the sa 76 field .",
    "these ridgelines follow the clear overdensity of faint , blue stars , as well as passing through the msto locus defined by the final sample of identified acs members .",
    "the acs members also clump tightly in the proper motion vpd ( figure  [ fig : vpd_members ] ) , as expected for a distant , co - moving stellar population .",
    "stellar parameters are estimated for all spectroscopic targets using a software pipeline developed by author jlc and others in the university of virginia stellar populations research group for this purpose .",
    "this pipeline uses fits to the distribution of [ fe / h ] as a function of low - resolution lick fe , mg , and h@xmath39 indices from the library of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the spectra of @xcite ) to determine individual stellar metallicities .",
    "details about the code , which is called ez_spam ( easy stellar parameters and metallicities ) , will be found in a forthcoming paper ( carlin et  al .",
    "2010 , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "measured metallicities for all stars observed in sa 76 are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : feh_hist ] .",
    "the expected distribution ( scaled to match the number of observed stars ) from the besanon galaxy model for stars with similar color and magnitude distribution as our targets is shown for comparison ( as we did for the rv sample ) .",
    "the distributions match quite well on visual inspection , and a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test finds a 79% probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population ( we note that this would likely be higher if a number of these stars were not acs members ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : feh_hist ] shows [ fe / h ] for only the 31 stars identified as acs members ( dashed histogram ) , again overlaying the scaled besanon distribution ( dot - dashed lines ) for corresponding selection criteria .",
    "the median metallicity of the acs members is [ fe / h ] = -0.81 , but with significant scatter .",
    "the median for the model is [ fe / h ] = -0.91 , and the k - s test for these two samples suggests a 47% probability that the acs members are drawn from the same population as the model distribution .",
    "however , only 9 of these 31 spectra have @xmath69 20 , so most of these measurements of [ fe / h ] should be regarded with some skepticism . the 9 stars with well - measured metallicities ( seen as a solid , filled histogram in fig .",

    "again , the spread in metallicity is rather broad , as is seen in many dsph systems , where there are often multiple epochs of star formation .    the apparent agreement between metallicities of the overall acs member sample with the besanon predictions ( if real ; see the caveat regarding low @xmath42 of most of these spectra in the previous paragraph ) could arise for several reasons .",
    "it may be that the acs `` members '' are actually a sample of thick disk and/or halo stars ( noting that , at @xmath2=26.4@xmath1 , or @xmath71 kpc at a distance of 10 kpc , near the galactic anticenter , the line of sight toward sa 76 is not sampling many thin disk msto stars at faint magnitudes ) , and thus agree with the [ fe / h ] expected for smooth galactic populations because they are drawn from exactly those populations .",
    "from the five realizations of the besanon model used for comparison , we find that a total of 214@xmath913 stars are expected within the color - magnitude selection initially applied ( 0.2@xmath350.6 and 18.5@xmath34 20.0 ) .",
    "of these , only 4@xmath92 are thin - disk stars , with the rest made up of thick disk and halo populations . in sa 76 ,",
    "we find 271 stars within the same selection criteria ( in a region of equal area to that of the model ) , a significant ( @xmath72 ) excess over the number of stars expected from the starcount models of smooth galactic populations that contribute to the besanon model .",
    "moreover , the acs shows a well - defined narrow main sequence in the sdss cmd of figure  [ fig : full_cmd ] ( or , more clearly , in fig .",
    "3 of ) indicative of a limited radial extent , unlike the smoother and more broadly distributed stellar populations that may arise if the acs results from a warp or flare of the galactic disk or a flyby encounter with a massive perturber @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if the line of sight intersected a warped or flared mw disk , it is unlikely that we would find the clear spatial separation of the narrow acs stream from the galactic thin / thick disks seen in ( see also our figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] below ) .",
    "it is thus unlikely that the acs sample consists primarily of the nominal mw stellar populations .",
    "the second ( and more likely ) possibility is that the acs stars are metal - poor remnants of a disrupted dsph , and thus resemble the metal - poor mw halo ( thought to be comprised mostly of stars from tidally disrupted dsphs and globular clusters ; e.g. , @xcite ) in the same magnitude and color ranges .",
    "discrimination between these two scenarios could be provided by high - resolution spectroscopic abundance analysis , wherein unique abundance patterns may be able to distinguish differences between the populations .",
    "from the final selected acs candidates , kinematical properties of the acs in sa 76 were estimated using a maximum likelihood method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a systemic heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath73 km s@xmath4 was derived for the acs component , with an intrinsic dispersion @xmath74 km s@xmath4 . a gaussian centered at this velocity , with fwhm matching the measured dispersion , and encompassing the total number of acs candidates is overplotted as a dotted curve on the rv histogram in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : vhel_hist ] .",
    "the sum of this gaussian distribution and the scaled , binned besanon model distribution ( filled histogram ) is plotted as the dot - dashed histogram , which reproduces the observed velocities remarkably well .",
    "this confirms our interpretation of the @xmath1097 km s@xmath4 peak , which is not expected among smooth galactic populations , as being due to kinematically cold substructure .",
    "the measured @xmath75 agrees with the measurement ( @xmath76 km s@xmath4 ) of at the 1.6@xmath77 level ( though we remind the reader that those same data are also included in our sample here ) , but we derive a dispersion more than twice the @xmath78 km s@xmath4 found by .",
    "this may mean that underestimated the intrinsic dispersion of the acs from their limited data set , or it may be that sampled one of the cold `` tributaries '' found by to make up the larger anticenter stream .",
    "in this latter scenario , the superposition of multiple cold populations ( whether from tributaries or multiple orbital wraps ) would lead to an overall larger measured dispersion . whichever of these is the case , our measured @xmath79 km s@xmath4 is typical of a tidal stream from a disrupted dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; further high - resolution study of large numbers of stars would be necessary to explore the possibility of multiple stream tributaries within this field of view .",
    "we also note that the @xmath80 km s@xmath4 dispersion we measure in sa 76 is consistent with result @xmath81 km s@xmath4 ) found by for acs debris @xmath82 from sa 76 in their field `` acs - b '' at @xmath83 .",

    "the clear narrow peak among radial velocities of these candidates confirms that we are indeed sampling members of a co - moving population among these candidates .",
    "because the stream traces such a distinct swath across the sky , we expect the tangential motions of stars within the identified velocity peak in sa 76 to follow this stream .",
    "the fact that the 3-d space velocity of the acs candidates is directed at a @xmath1030-degree angle to the visible stream led us to explore the possibility that there was a systematic error in our proper motion measurements .",

    "our measurement for candidate acs debris stars is lower than both this prediction and the expected proper motions of milky way populations along this line of sight .",
    "thus the misalignment of our measured pm from the expected stream motion can not be due to contamination of our sample by foreground milky way stars , which would actually bring our measurements _ closer _ to the expected stream motion .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the besanon - predicted total proper motion , @xmath148 = 2.68 mas yr@xmath4 , is nearly twice that of the proper motion we measured ( @xmath149 = 1.43 mas yr@xmath4 ) for acs debris  a difference of @xmath150 .",

    "based on all of the above arguments , we conclude that the difference between the orientation of the 3-d space motion we measure for purported acs debris and the expected direction of motion is not due to systematic errors in the proper motions , but is a real kinematical difference .",

    "their figure 2 shows total starcounts as a function of right ascension in slices at constant declination across the stream .",
    "it is clear from that figure that there are at least 3 main components , and probably a number of other sub - streams making up the anticenter stream complex .",
    "thus , in order to measure the bulk motion and derive an orbit for the stream progenitor , it may be necessary to disentangle these tributaries and assess the contributions of residual motion about a common center of mass ( i.e. the progenitor dwarf galaxy ) that the separate components may have shared .",
    "the measured motion of acs candidates in sa 76 ( represented as a vector by the cyan arrow in figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] ) appears to follow the western substream studied by , which loops outward to the west and separates from the main ( or `` central '' ) stream component to the north of sa 76 in figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] .",
    "the orientation of our derived acs motion from sa 76 stars may represent the peculiar motion of this substream about the orbital center of the stream progenitor .",
    "figure  [ fig : starcounts_weststream ] depicts the same starcount map , but zoomed to the region near sa 76 . on this figure ,",
    "we have traced a possible course of the western substream , which is guided in part by the peaks identified by in profiles of starcounts taken across the stream at positions of constant declination .",
    "this is simply shown as a guide to the reader to illustrate our suggestion that the sa 76 kinematics may reflect the motion of the western tributary .",
    "note also that the open box denoting the position of sa 76 in figure  [ fig : starcounts_weststream ] is in a region of lower stream density ( white in the figure ) on the periphery of the acs .    as mentioned previously , the total 3-d space velocity we measured ( @xmath167 km s@xmath4 ) differs by only 47 km s@xmath4 from the best - fit acs model motion of at the position of sa 76 ( @xmath168 km s@xmath4 ) . in testing the possibility that pal 12 was previously associated with the sagittarius dsph , @xcite calculated an escape velocity of @xmath1040 km s@xmath4 for a globular cluster bound to a sgr - like 10@xmath169 m@xmath170 satellite .",
    "thus the relative velocities are consistent with components such as globular clusters or other distinct kinematical overdensities within the progenitor .",
    "furthermore , the angle between these 3-d velocity vectors is only @xmath171 .",
    "this fact taken together with the similarity of the space velocities suggests that the orbits , though oriented in slightly different directions , may be associated , with their slight misalignment a remnant of peculiar motions about the center of mass of the progenitor system .",
    "moreover , the integrals of motion for both orbits are similar : the total angular momenta ( per unit mass ) for the two orbits agree within @xmath10 20 - 25% , and their orbital energies differ by @xmath1010 - 15% .",
    "this is suggests of similar orbits for the main acs stream and the motion we have measured in sa 76 , in spite of the misalignment with the visible stream .",
    "it may be that the acs represents the remnant of a progenitor satellite that originally had its own satellites orbiting within its gravitational potential , similar to the globular clusters associated with the sgr dsph ( e.g. @xcite ) or the fornax dsph ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that this richly substructured stream complex is the result of an infalling group of associated satellites that fell into the milky way together , as in , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the low - inclination , nearly - circular orbit derived for the acs suggests that one may expect debris from multiple wraps of the best - fit orbit ( or two separate sub - systems ) to be present in sa 76 , perhaps with distinct radial velocity signatures .",
    "debris from the subsequent wrap of the orbit in passes through the acs locus at a distance of @xmath1015 kpc ( though at a declination 10 - 20@xmath1 north of sa 76 ) .",
    "we will consider this as a reasonable distance for debris from a second orbital wrap .",
    "a difference of 3 - 5 kpc in distance corresponds to an offset of @xmath172 0.6 - 1.0 magnitudes in the cmd .",
    "it is unlikely that these two overlapping stellar populations can be separated ( while also separating stream members from galactic contamination ) without accurate rvs from medium - to - high resolution spectra for _ all _ stars at the faint end of our survey .",
    "there is the hint of a concentration of stars blueward of the obvious acs main sequence , but below the acs turnoff ( at @xmath173 ) in the cmd of figure  [ fig : full_cmd ] ( left panel ) , suggestive of a second msto .",
    "however , this occurs near the magnitude limit of the proper motion survey , and we are unable to explore the possibility of a second population with the data in hand .",
    "we do note that the apparent scatter in proper motions for bright ( @xmath17418.5 ) stars ( candidate acs red giants ) discussed in section 3 could arise from the superposition of multiple rgbs . if this is the case , it would also explain the lack of a narrowly defined rgb among brighter stars with acs - like rvs , suggesting that the large pm scatter in rgb - like stars is a reflection of true differences in pms of different populations .",
    "the presence of multiple wraps of stellar debris in sa 76 could also explain the large metallicity spread seen in figure  [ fig : feh_hist ] .",
    "many dsphs are known to have radial gradients in [ fe / h ] , and , as shown by @xcite for the sagittarius tidal tails , the preferential stripping of outer populations from dsphs gives rise to metallicity gradients along the debris streams .",
    "if the acs arises from such a scenario , the superposition of two populations from multiple orbital wraps ( thus having different mean metallicities ) in sa 76 could then produce a broader metallicity distribution than expected from a single population .",
    "though the reason our measured kinematics in sa 76 are not oriented along the visible anticenter stream remains unclear , we have ruled out systematic proper motion errors and sagittarius tidal debris as the origin of the misalignment .",
    "the space velocity we have measured for acs candidates in sa 76 is similar to that of the orbital fit , is directed along a visible substream , and has motion relative to the main stream similar to what is seen for globular clusters that orbit other local group dwarf galaxies ( either intact or disrupted ) .",
    "based on these properties , we argue that our measurements reflect the motion of a tributary of the main acs system .",
    "this substream may be the remnant of either a globular cluster or companion dwarf galaxy that was bound to the larger system that was the acs progenitor .",
    "there have been numerous studies of stellar systems in the anticenter and outer galactic disk region all purporting to be monoceros ( also known as `` gass '' ) debris @xcite . in this section",
    ", we attempt to sort out the many detections and determine ( based on our measured kinematics ) whether the distinct acs feature is related to mon .",
    "the many purported mon detections within the western sdss footprint are highlighted as various colored symbols in the starcount map of figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] . from this figure",
    ", it is clear that mon , as reported in previous work , would be a large feature spanning much of the low - latitude sky near the galactic anticenter .",
    "the acs , on the other hand , was eventually revealed to be a narrow , well - defined stellar stream ( with even narrower substreams ) by .",
    "a few of the claimed mon detections appear to be spatially coincident with the acs ( e.g. the points from @xcite , one of the @xcite fields , the @xcite point , and a handful of the m giants from @xcite ) , while the majority of the remaining mon candidates are at lower latitudes than the acs .",
    "it is possible that the two systems are associated , but if they are distinct systems , some of the stars and overdensities previously associated with mon may actually be members of the anticenter stream .",
    "accurate kinematical and stellar abundance study of large numbers of stars in this region ( preferably covering a contiguous area ) may make it possible to determine whether these are associated features of the same disruption event , a spatial coincidence of unrelated systems , or confusion of not well discriminated early studies of structures near the galactic antienter . in this section",
    ", we compare the properties of monoceros and the acs to explore their possible association .",
    "the abundance spread for claimed monoceros detections is not fully understood , with a variety of conflicting results making this feature difficult to understand .",
    "one of the earliest studies of monoceros @xcite estimated [ fe / h ] = -1.6 @xmath9 0.3 from sdss spectra of msto f stars , while @xcite found a much higher [ fe / h ] = -0.4 @xmath9 0.3 for 2mass - selected m giants . from these two results alone , it is obvious that if the various mon overdensities derive from a single structure , then there must have been a significant metallicity spread within the mon progenitor .",
    "@xcite derive [ fe / h ] = -0.95 for monoceros based on photometric metallicites of thousands of f- and g - type dwarfs near the galactic anticenter from the sdss database , and also show that this metallicity is quite distinct from the mw halo and disk in this direction ( see their figure 18 ) .",
    "our result for the acs is generally rather similar to these results for monoceros , in that we find a predominantly metal - poor population , but with broad scatter .",
    "additional work on a / f - type stars by @xcite found @xmath175[fe / h]@xmath132 = -1.37 , with scatter of @xmath100.5 dex  both their mean metallicity and the spread of measurements are comparable to what we have found for the acs from stars of similar spectral type .",
    "the stars in this @xcite study are located in two sdss plates that are on or near the obvious acs feature in figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] ( where @xcite fields are shown as open red circles ) .",
    "the population identified as mon debris in the southernmost of these fields ( plates 1149/1154 , at ( @xmath176 ) had measured radial velocity of 88 km s@xmath4 , which is consistent with the rv for the acs orbit derived by at that position .",
    "thus , though @xcite have claimed these to be monoceros stars , it is likely that their study is sampling acs debris from the same populations we are studying in sa 76 .    finally , we note that @xcite show that many m giants ( selected from @xcite ) in their high - resolution spectroscopic study near the anticenter have [ fe / h]@xmath10 -0.9 ( as expected from @xcite ) , with a tail extending to higher metallicities ( confirming the results of @xcite ) .",
    "this work shows that these mon m giants have @xmath14 and s - process elemental abundance trends similar to those of m giants in the sagittarius tidal tails , as well as other dsphs .",
    "while this suggests a dwarf galaxy origin for the monoceros stars , it can not definitively rule out that mon is the result of a `` puffing up '' of the disk due to an encounter , since the outer disk itself may be formed hierarchically from merger events .",
    "the similarity of the rather narrow anticenter stream ( which is likely the result of a dsph disruption ) to the much more broadly distributed monoceros feature could be because the acs is the coherent remnant of a larger disruption event that produced the entire mon `` ring '' .",
    "alternatively , it may simply be that spatial coincidence has led to the conflation of two distinct structures , and that confusion leads to acs members `` contaminating '' determinations of mon properties",
    ".      predicted galactocentric radial velocities as a function of galactic longitude are shown in figure  [ fig : lv_compare ] for our derived orbit of sa 76 acs debris ( top panel ) , with the best - fit orbits from ( acs ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mon ) in the lower two panels .",
    "a similar plot in figure  [ fig : lb_compare ] shows the spatial distribution of the acs and monoceros orbits in galactic coordinates .",
    "comparison data from the literature are shown in both figures using the same colors and symbols as in figure  [ fig : starcounts_orbit ] for claimed monoceros detections near our sa 76 field .",
    "the large filled square representing our measured velocity for acs debris at the position of sa 76 is slightly outside the hatched region in figure  [ fig : lv_compare ] , which represents an object in a circular orbit with velocity of 220 km s@xmath4 at r@xmath100 = 18 kpc , with a dispersion of 30 km s@xmath4 ( similar to @xcite ; note that , assuming a flat mw rotation curve , this velocity and dispersion are thin disk - like ) .",
    "our newly derived orbit is the only one of the three shown that exhibits significantly non - circular motion ( i.e. extends well outside the hatched region ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lv_compare ] .",
    "the orbit derived by @xcite for monoceros predicts a velocity in sa 76 that is similar to what we have measured , but can not reproduce the spatial distribution of the acs , as noted in .",
    "we note , however , that our orbit derived from kinematics in sa 76 also fails to reproduce the swath of acs debris ( the grey `` bar '' in figure  [ fig : lb_compare ] ) that spans the entire declination range of the western sdss footprint .",
    "our derived orbit traverses slightly higher galactic latitudes in figure  [ fig : lb_compare ] than the other two models , but is qualitatively quite similar to the result of , which suggests that our current study is measuring distinct `` tributaries '' or successive orbital wraps of the same stream system modeled in .",
    "the orbit also reproduces many of the known detections of mon debris in both velocity and position , but further detailed study incorporating all acs and mon data would be necessary to verify an association of the acs with the monoceros ring .    with 3-d kinematics , we can assess the similarity of the orbits derived by various studies by examining the integrals of motion .",
    "as discussed in  6 , the mean motion we have measured in sa 76 corresponds to an angular momentum ( per unit mass ) of @xmath177 kpc km s@xmath4 , placing the sa 76 acs debris on a prograde orbit .",
    "this differs by only @xmath178 from the @xmath179 kpc km s@xmath4 predicted by the acs orbit along the sa 76 line of sight .",
    "@xcite measured three - dimensional stellar kinematics from an overdensity of purported monoceros debris in sa 71 and found @xmath180 kpc km s@xmath4 , which agrees with the acs results within the uncertainties .",
    "the orbit derived from our kinematics in sa 76 produces a radial velocity near the @xcite measurement for sa 71 at @xmath181 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lv_compare ] ) , and also passes near the spatial location of sa 71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lb_compare ] ) , so it is possible that the debris in these two fields originated from the same progenitor .",
    "@xcite studied kinematics near the anticenter using thousands of stars from the sdss database at galactocentric distances @xmath182 kpc , and found an excess of stars with very little vertical ( i.e. , along galactic latitude , perpendicular to the disk ) motion and rotation velocities faster than the local standard of rest ( lsr ) rotation by @xmath183 km s@xmath4 . at a distance of 15 kpc , this results in @xmath184 kpc km s@xmath4 , which is also similar to the angular momenta from both the acs results and the mon debris in sa 71 .",
    "we note , though , that in our result , the orbit , and the sa 71 measurement @xcite , the rotation component of the motion lags the lsr , while @xcite find mon to be _",
    "faster _ than the lsr by @xmath185 km s@xmath4 . ultimately , while all of these measurements are finding similar orbital angular momenta , there is still insufficient discriminating power in the results to assess whether the acs and mon share a common origin .",
    "it is important to remind the reader that the derived orbit we have shown was integrated in a spherical milky way halo .",
    "the best fits for monoceros from @xcite require an oblate dark matter halo ( i.e. @xmath186 1 , where @xmath187 is the ratio of minor axis to the major axis of the potential ) to reproduce the observed characteristics of the detections assumed to be part of the monoceros system at the time .",
    "the difference in halo potentials used may be the source of at least some of the discrepancy between their model and our derived orbits in figures  [ fig : lv_compare ] and [ fig : lb_compare ] .",
    "constraints on the halo flattening based on the sagittarius dsph tidal stream have variously argued that the halo is prolate ( @xmath188 1 ; @xcite ) , nearly spherical ( @xmath189 0 ; @xcite ) , or slightly oblate",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite were able to simultaneously reproduce most observed characteristics of the sagittarius stream by modeling the halo as triaxial , thus reconciling the prior seemingly conflicting results , wherein a prolate halo was required to match radial velocities of leading debris , while an oblate halo was needed to get the correct positions along the leading arm .",
    "further constraints on the mw halo shape can be derived by modeling the precession of other tidal streams , and once the acs and monoceros systems are well understood , they might be used to trace the low - latitude dark matter structure of the milky way . however , for this work we chose simply to use a spherical halo model to assess the general qualitative structure of the orbit implied by the 3-d velocity we have measured .",
    "a more comprehensive study utilizing all extant data for the acs and mon features ( which also would require sorting out which data to include for each system ) and varying halo parameters is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we simply note here that changing the halo shape ( and other parameters , such as the rotation speed at the solar circle , or the distance of the sun from the galactic center ) would alter the exact characteristics of the orbit shown in figures  [ fig : orbit_xyz ] , [ fig : lv_compare ] , and [ fig : lb_compare ] , but not the general structure of a low - latitude , ring - like feature .",
    "we have found that the 3-d kinematics of sa 76 stars selected to be anticenter stream members produce unexpected results  the orbit derived from the measured motions does not follow the obvious stream ( and the orbit fit to it by ) from the sdss database , but rather is inclined to it by @xmath1030@xmath1 .",
    "this makes it difficult to reach conclusions about the global structure of the acs based on our measurements  we are unable to confirm or rule out an association of the acs with the many monoceros stream detections or to speculate on a possible progenitor for the system .",
    "we do conclude , however , that our findings can best be explained if the acs debris in sa 76 is part of one of the apparently kinematically cold substreams or tributaries found by @xcite to make up the larger acs stream .",
    "in fact , the measured motions of sa 76 acs debris and the acs orbit of @xcite suggest that the substreams may be the remnants of two ( or more ) satellites that fell into ( and were disrupted by ) the milky way together",
    ". more detailed photometric and chemodynamical studies of the acs are necessary to explore this possibility . in addition , the association of the eastern banded structure with the acs could possibly be confirmed by studies extending beyond the @xmath190 limit of the sdss footprint .",
