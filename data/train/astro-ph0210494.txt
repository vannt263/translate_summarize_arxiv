    "the statistics of strong gravitational lensing has repeatedly been advertised and used as a probe of cosmology ( e.g. , turner , ostriker & gott 1984 , hinshaw and krauss 1987 , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 , krauss and white 1992 , kochanek 1995 , 1996 , cooray , quashnock & miller 1999 , chiba & yoshii 1999 , cheng & krauss 1999 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of lensing counts to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the energy densities in matter and the vacuum component relative to the critical , comes mostly from a volume effect : higher @xmath4 implies bigger comoving volume for a fixed redshift , leading to the higher optical depth for lensing . using knowledge about the luminosity function of galaxies and their density profiles ,",
    "many authors have used lensing statistics to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , fukugita and turner ( 1991 ) first constrained the vacuum energy density to be less than about 90% of the critical energy density ( @xmath5 ) at 95% confidence level ( hereafter cl ) .",
    "subsequently this was followed by kochanek ( 1995 , 1996 ) , who claimed an upper limit on the vacuum energy density ( @xmath6 at 95% cl ) .",
    "krauss and white ( 1992 ) and later chiba and yoshii ( 1999 ) and cheng and krauss ( 1999 ) used a different choice of galaxy parameters and demonstrated that a flat vacuum - energy - dominated universe could be favored .",
    "similar analyses have been performed by i m et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , cooray , quashnock & miller ( 1999 ) , waga & miceli ( 1999 ) , and all typically favor the @xmath7cdm cosmology .",
    "cheng and krauss ( 1999 , 2001 ) also explored how uncertainties in the choice of galaxy parameters could result in vastly different constraints on cosmology , although they argued for a choice that ultimately favored a flat , vacuum - energy - dominated cosmology .",
    "it has also recently been argued that strong - lensing statistics from ongoing surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) might impose interesting constraints on the equation - of - state ratio of dark energy @xmath8 ( cooray & huterer 1999 ) ; constraints on @xmath8 from lensing have already been claimed by sarbu , rusin & ma ( 2001 ) who used the statistics of the  jvas / class survey to obtain @xmath9 .",
    "similar results have been obtained very recently by chae et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    given the notoriously poor statistics of strong lensing surveys thus far ",
    "the total number of gravitational lenses is of order fifty , and the largest homogeneous survey ( which we use in this work ) , jvas / class , currently has a total of only 17 events combined with the existing galactic luminosity function uncertainties , it is not clear how seriously one should take any constraints on cosmology derived from strong lensing statistics . to constrain cosmological parameters using lensing statistics",
    "one has to deal with the strong dependence of the results on the lens profile , the density dispersion of galactic dark matter , the number density of galaxies as a function of redshift , and observational effects due to magnification bias and the selection function of the survey .    in this work ,",
    "we exploit this sensitivity to reverse the traditional methodology .",
    "since lensing statistics are , on the whole , much more sensitive to astrophysical than cosmological parameters , we wish to utilize existing surveys to probe the properties of lensing galaxies rather than cosmology .",
    "we are aided in this effort at this time because independent probes of cosmological parameters have recently converged rather tightly on a single cosmological model : a flat dark energy dominated universe with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . as these parameters currently seem",
    "to be more tightly constrained that the galaxy parameters described above , now seems an opportune time to use cosmology to constrain astrophysics , rather than vice versa !",
    "some efforts along these lines have already been explored , as new and better lensing data , especially the jvas / class survey , have appeared . in particular , several investigations have been undertaken to constrain the nature of galaxy clustering in the cdm paradigm .",
    "keeton ( 2001 ) used the statistics of jvas / class lenses to indicate that cdm galaxies are too concentrated to agree with the lensing statistics , while keeton & madau ( 2001 ) used the absence of wide - separation lenses in the class survey to impose an upper bound on the concentration of dark matter halos .",
    "takahashi & chiba ( 2001 ) consider lensing by both singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) and navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile galaxies , and find that the lack of observed large - angle separation lenses indicates that the density profile is not too steep ( @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ) .",
    "oguri , taruya & suto ( 2001 ) obtained a similar result by using the statistics of tangential and radial arcs .",
    "conversely , rusin & ma ( 2001 ) use the absence of detectable odd images to set a constraint on the surface density of lensing galaxies , and conclude that lenses can not have profiles much shallower than an sis ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "wyithe et al . ( 2001 ) and li & ostriker ( 2002 ) considered lensing by objects with both sis and generalized nfw ( gnfw ) density profiles .",
    "they computed optical depths , image separations and magnification biases .",
    "in particular , li & ostriker , extending the earlier work of keeton ( 1998 ) and porciani & madau ( 2000 ) argued that , in order to explain the large number of observed small - separation lenses and the lack of large - separation events ( compared to predicted distributions for lensing by clusters ) , the favored galaxy cluster profile seems to be the combination of sis ( when @xmath15 ) and nfw ( when @xmath16 ) .",
    "here we carry out a related analysis , with the aim of constraining the nature of individual galaxies rather than clusters .",
    "for this purpose we shall assume the `` concordance '' values for the cosmological parameters ( e.g. krauss 2000 ) : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath3 and @xmath20 are energy densities in matter and dark energy relative to critical , @xmath8 is the equation of state ratio of dark energy , and @xmath21 .",
    "we will show that our results are extremely weakly dependent on the assumed cosmology ( in particular , knowledge of @xmath3 ) .",
    "although more than 60 multiply imaged quasars and radio sources are known , they come from different observations with different sensitivities and selection functions , which makes an accurate computation of the expected number of lenses very difficult . therefore , it is imperative to have data from a single well - understood survey with information on the source population . in this work we use the most complete homogeneous sample of lenses provided by the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; myers et al .",
    "2002 , browne et al .",
    "2002 ) , which extended the earlier jodrell - very large array astrometric survey ( jvas ; patnaik et al .",
    "1992a , king et al . 1999 ) .",
    "class is using the very large array to image radio sources with the flux density of between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; candidate lensing events are followed up by multi - element radio - linked interferometer network ( merlin ) and the nrao very large baseline array ( vlbi ) .",
    "so far a total of about 16,000 sources were imaged by jvas / class , with 22 confirmed lensing events . of these , a subset of 8958 sources with 13 lenses forms a well - defined subsample suitable for statistical analysis ( browne et al .",
    "2002 ) , and we use this subsample in our work .",
    "table 1 , essentially identical to table 3 in browne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , shows the lenses from the statistically controlled subsample .",
    "we have added information about the identity of the lens , in particular whether it is a spiral galaxy , an elliptical , or formed by more than one galaxy ( chae 2002 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is well known that elliptical galaxies dominate the optical depth for strong lensing by individual galaxies ( e.g. kochanek 1993b ) , and as a result we concentrate on constraining their parameters here .",
    "this effort is somewhat complicated by the fact that only six of the class lenses are clearly identified as ellipticals and one as a spiral , while in other cases the identity of the lens is uncertain ; see table 1 . furthermore , three events are due to more than one lens galaxy .",
    "it is crucial to choose a subset of class lenses that includes elliptical galaxies only .",
    "it is clear that the number of ellipticals is between 6 and 12 , and that confirmed ellipticals outnumber spirals in ratio 6:1 .",
    "the most likely value of the number of ellipticals is therefore somewhere near 11 . to compute the measured number of lenses",
    ", we chose marginalize over the range between 6 and 12 , with the gaussian weighting centered at 11 and variance of @xmath24 .",
    "however , as we later discuss , the results are extremely insensitive to the exact choice of weighting ; the reason is that the statistics are much more sensitive to the parameters we wish to constrain , the velocity dispersion and density profile of elliptical galaxies .",
    "for the angular separation test , we use only the four _ single _ elliptical lenses ( b0712 + 472 , b1422 + 231 , b1933 + 503 , b2319 + 051 ) . to test the robustness of this test",
    ", we alternatively assume that all unidentified galaxies are ellipticals as well , and use a total of 9 _ single _ non - spiral lenses ( the four above , plus b0445 + 123 , b0631 + 519 , b0850 + 054 , b1152 + 199 and b2045 + 265 ) . as discussed later on , our results are insensitive to the exact choice of this subset .",
    "we wish to utilize three different observables to obtain our constraints : the overall optical depth @xmath25 to a source at redshift @xmath26 , the differential optical depth as a function of angular separation , and the differential optical depth as a function of lens redshift .",
    "unfortunately , the last of these tests is uncertain due to possible incompleteness of the survey : higher - redshift lenses are more difficult to measure due to their lower fluxes ; while the source redshifts are more easily measurable for objects very far away ( mainly quasars ) and very close ( mainly galaxies ) , and not ones at intermediate distances .",
    "because of these uncertainties , and because the redshift test does not add much to our constraints , we decide not to use the redshift - distribution test is independent of galaxy parameters , and we used it to check that constraint on @xmath3 and @xmath8 is consistent with the adopted cosmological model @xmath27 , @xmath18 . ]",
    "we are therefore left with two tests , the total optical depth ( @xmath25-test ) and angular separation ( @xmath28-test ) .",
    "the former test gives stronger constraints in both sis and gnfw cases .",
    "the latter test , in the sis case , is independent of @xmath26 as long as @xmath29 ; henceforth , the knowledge of @xmath26 is not necessary and all single ellipticals ( chosen as explained above ) can be used for this test . in the gnfw case",
    "the knowledge of @xmath26 is required for this test , and when it is not available we use the mean redshift of the measured sources , @xmath30 .",
    "( we have checked that the results change negligibly if , instead of @xmath30 , we use the histogram of the source distribution from marlow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which is centered at @xmath31 and has long tails . )",
    "finally , we use the maximum lens separation @xmath32 as an estimator of the angular separation @xmath33 .",
    "although this estimator has been widely used in the literature due to the fact that @xmath32 are readily available , we warn that the angle corresponding to the average image radius fitted to a lens model , for example , would be a better estimator . nevertheless , we do not expect that using @xmath34 will significantly bias the results , given the limited current statistics .",
    "moreover , since higher @xmath35 roughly corresponds to larger angular separations , our results may only be biased to _ higher _ @xmath35 , strengthening our conclusion that this parameter is smaller than previously quoted in the literature .    in order to compute the _ expected _ optical depth for any given model , it is crucial to know the redshifts of source quasars and galaxies .",
    "the redshift distribution of jvas / class source objects has been discussed in marlow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who spectroscopically followed up 42 sources at william herschel telescope .",
    "most of these sources are quasars ; with a significant admixture of galaxies at @xmath36 .",
    "the mean redshift of this subsample is @xmath37 with an rms spread of 0.95 . in this work",
    "we use the full histogram distribution of the observed subsample of sources ( fig .  2 in marlow et al .",
    "2000 ) , and assume that the redshift distribution of the subsample gives a good representation of the overall redshift distribution .",
    "one has to be cautious , however , since the lensed sources come from a fainter population than the ones in marlow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and may be at different redshifts . the validity of this assumption has been examined by chae ( 2002 ) , who reviews existing observations and finds that the redshift distribution is expected not to change much at lower flux densities , corresponding to lensed sources .",
    "finally , we will need to know a few other details regarding the class sample .",
    "the survey is complete at image separations @xmath38 ( helbig 2000 , myers et al .",
    "all confirmed jvas / class lenses have image separations @xmath39",
    ". the distribution of sources as a function of the total flux density @xmath40 is well described by the power law    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the number of sources observed in flux density interval @xmath43 . for jvas / class , @xmath44 ( rusin & tegmark 2001 ) .",
    "there is good evidence that the density profiles of dark halos on cluster scales depend on the halo mass ( keeton 1998 , wyithe et al .",
    "2001 , li and ostriker 2002 ) . for the less massive halos ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "sis profiles are found to be adequate , while for large - mass halos ( @xmath46 ) nfw profiles provides a good fit .",
    "this result is also expected from semianalytic models , which show that objects smaller than @xmath47 are subject to baryonic cooling , whereby baryons collapse to the center thereby enormously increasing the central density and lensing cross - section , and converting the shallow nfw profiles into the steep sis ( rix et al .",
    "1997 , kochanek & white 2001 , keeton 2001 ) .",
    "galaxy clusters tend to lead to large lens separations and/or extended arcs and arclets .",
    "since    @xmath48    ( li & ostriker 2002 ) where all quantities except @xmath49 are evaluated at @xmath50 , we see that @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath51 . if we are interested in primarily lensing by individual galaxies rather than clusters , we should concentrate on image separations substantially smaller than this value . in class ,",
    "all lensing events have separations smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the class lenses are due to individual galaxies and not clusters .",
    "furthermore , we assume smooth , spherically symmetric density profiles .",
    "this assumption is widely used , and supported by the findings that the subclumps do not greatly affect the total optical depth for lensing ( flores , maller & primack 1996 ) and that asphericity of density profiles affects mostly the ratio of quads to doubles and not the optical depth ( rusin & tegmark 2001 ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to constrain the galaxy velocity dispersion _ assuming _ the sis profile .",
    "the sis profile has repeatedly been used in the past to constrain cosmological parameters , assuming the schechter function parameters and the galaxy velocity dispersion to be known .",
    "we would like to reverse this process and see whether the previously - used @xmath35 is still favored now that we have good knowledge of cosmological parameters .",
    "second , we would like to constrain the density profile of elliptical galaxies . as argued above",
    ", only the inner parts of lens galaxies ( a few tens of kiloparsecs from the center ) are responsible for class events . moreover , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : gnfw ] , there is good evidence that cores of galaxies are small and can safely be ignored .",
    "therefore , it seems justified to adopt @xmath13 and try to constrain @xmath53 .",
    "we do this via the generalized navarro - frenk - white profile , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : gnfw ] .",
    "since we are interested in elliptical galaxies , we adopt the schechter luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) which has repeatedly been shown to be a good fit to the measurements    @xmath54    there has been much discussion as to what values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 best describe the actual luminosity function .",
    "typically , it is argued that @xmath57 for all galaxies , of which @xmath58 are ellipticals ( postman & geller , 1984 ) , so that @xmath59 ; further , @xmath60 with fairly large uncertainties .",
    "recently the sdss ( blanton et al . 2001 ) claimed a more accurate determination of the local ( @xmath61 ) luminosity function ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "to relate the luminosities to velocity dispersions , we use the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 )    @xmath64    where it is typically assumed that @xmath65 for the sis profile .",
    "our principal goal is to determine the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath66 and @xmath35 .",
    "the optical depth for a lens at redshift @xmath67 due to a particular source at @xmath26 is given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the comoving number density of lenses , @xmath70 is their luminosity , @xmath71 is their cross - section for lensing , and @xmath72 is the magnification bias , describing the fact that lensed galaxies will be magnified , and therefore seen more easily , and therefore are enhanced in any flux limited survey . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt_depth ] ) we have allowed for a general redshift and luminosity dependence of the number density , cross - section and magnification . for redshift - independent ( as we first assume ) @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath66 , @xmath73 depends only on @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , assuming that class lenses are described by an sis profile and the radio luminosity function is a power law , @xmath74 is simply a constant ( see below ) .",
    "the density profile for the sis is given by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "this distribution produces an image separation of @xmath77 , where the einstein radius @xmath78 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the angular diameter distances between the lens and source , and observer and source respectively . the cross - section for lensing is therefore    @xmath81    we only consider angular separations greater than some minimum value @xmath82 , since the resolution limit of class is @xmath83 , and multiple images with smaller separation angles than @xmath82 will not be resolved .",
    "the correspondence between the luminosity and angular separation for an sis lens is    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the speed of light , so that @xmath82 corresponds to some @xmath86 as the lower limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt_depth ] ) .",
    "we also need to compute the magnification bias .",
    "it is given by    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the source luminosity function and @xmath89 the distribution of total magnifications .",
    "for the power - law luminosity function of class ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : dnds ] ) ) and the distributions of magnifications for sis lenses ( @xmath90 ) , the bias simplifies to ( sarbu , rusin & ma 2001 )    @xmath91    finally , we will be interested in the quantity @xmath28 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath92    & = & \\int_0^{z_s } { dd_l\\over dz}(z_l)\\ , dz_l\\,(1+z_l)^3    { d\\phi\\over dl}(l , z_l)\\ , \\times \\\\[0.1 cm ]   & & \\sigma_{\\rm sis}(l , z_l , z_s)\\ ,   b(l , z_l , z_s)\\times\\left.{d\\l\\over d\\theta}\\right|_{\\theta_1}\\nonumber ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the correspondence between @xmath70 and @xmath33 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_vs_theta ] ) note also that we have allowed , in these formulas , for a general dependence of the luminosity function , @xmath70 , on @xmath67 , which we shall consider later in this paper .      to illustrate the dependence of our observables ( @xmath25 and @xmath28 ) upon the parameters , we assume for a moment the following fiducial values : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for purposes of this illustration",
    "we have also assumed all sources to be at a fixed redshift , chosen to be @xmath97 .",
    "the dependence of lensing statistics on the galaxy parameters and various degeneracies between these parameters have been investigated extensively in the literature ( see e.g. kochanek 1993a , 1993b ) ; here we present a brief overview .",
    "the variation of the total optical depth @xmath25 around this fiducial model can easily be computed to be    @xmath98    perhaps not surprisingly , the strongest dependence is on the velocity dispersion , which strongly affects the lensing cross - section , as well as the luminosity function .",
    "@xmath55 enters linearly , and is degenerate with other factors , for example the magnification bias which is also a pure constant in the sis case .",
    "note , however , the much weaker dependence upon the cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "this reinforces the notion , independent of observational uncertainties , that lensing constraints might most effectively be used to constrain galaxy profile and luminosity function parameters , in particular @xmath35 , rather than cosmological parameters .",
    "[ fig : sis_depend ] shows the dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath99 on @xmath35 .",
    "as expected , @xmath25 is a strongly increasing function of @xmath35 , while @xmath99 favors higher angular splittings with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "as we shall describe , the fact that we only compare theory with observation for @xmath100 ( the angular resolution of the survey ) allows the likelihood function for angular splitting to be consistent with that for optical depth , which favors models with low @xmath35 .",
    "we briefly comment on the dependence on other parameters .",
    "assuming @xmath101 , only @xmath25 depends on this quantity ( we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolving ] that this is essentially true even if @xmath55 is redshift - dependent ) .",
    "since @xmath25 scales directly with @xmath55 , the presence of other parameters implies that constraints on @xmath55 will be very weak .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that , in the sis case , @xmath25 only depends on the combination @xmath102 ( this is slightly spoiled by the fact that the luminosity integral starts at @xmath103 ) .",
    "we found that even trying to constrain this combination gives weak constraints  from either @xmath25 or @xmath28 test .",
    "the only parameter that we are able to significantly constrain is @xmath35 .",
    "as we have mentioned there are several ways to use statistics of strong gravitational lensing . the total number of lenses  predicted vs. observed  is an obvious and most commonly used statistics which provides information about the integrated optical depth for lensing .",
    "the angular splitting and redshift distribution of lenses are the other statistical observables , and in this work we use the former .",
    "we choose not to use the redshift distribution due to selection effects that are presumed to be significant in this test .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that the redshift distribution , if included , adds results consistent with the other two constraints .    the probability of the total optical depth can be computed using the poisson distribution ( e.g.  kochanek 1993b )    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the number of adopted lenses in the class survey , @xmath106 is the number of galaxies predicted by the model , and @xmath107 is the computed optical depth given the schechter function and cosmological parameters .",
    "this formula gives the correct likelihood for any value of @xmath25 .",
    "recall that our determination of @xmath25 was based on the marlow et al .",

    "finally , the joint likelihood for the redshift and angular distribution of galaxies , which takes into account correlations between these two observables , is given by    @xmath112    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we do not quote results from this test due to uncertainties regarding the redshift completeness .",
    "we do illustrate the constraints it gives in the gnfw case to demonstrate that including this result would not change our conclusions .",
    "the total likelihood we use is    @xmath113    and it depends on cosmological parameters , as well as the schechter function parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath66 and @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : depend ] ) suggests that , for the sis profile , by far the strongest dependence amongst the various lensing statistics is on the velocity dispersion @xmath35 .",
    "we determine the likelihood of @xmath35 by marginalizing over the other parameters :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 refers to any combination of the likelihood functions discussed above .",
    "+    as mentioned above , the strong dependence of the optical depth on the velocity dispersion @xmath35 implies that we might hope to get an interesting constraint on @xmath35 despite the relatively poor lensing statistics and degeneracies between lensing parameters .",

    "these ranges are conservative , allowing the full spread of values reported in various recent measurements .",
    "we also made sure to use intervals that are _ symmetric _ around the traditionally favored values , although it turns out that the exact choice of intervals affects the results very weakly .",
    "for example , the sdss , from its commissioning data ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicates that @xmath62 and @xmath119 , while the two degree field survey from their preliminary sample of 45000 galaxies ( cross et al .",
    "2001 ) gives @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; both of these quote the _ total _",
    "luminosity function .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , on the other hand , isolated early type galaxies from the k - band luminosity function , obtaining @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "finally , there are direct , independent constraints on the faber - jackson slope @xmath66 from the lens data ; for example , rusin et al .  (",
    "2002 ) find @xmath124 for early - type galaxies .",
    "[ fig : sis_constr ] shows the 68% and 95% cl constraints from the @xmath25 and @xmath28 tests ( top panels ) , as well as the constraints from the two tests combined ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these constraints correspond to solid curves in the three panels ; for comparison , the dashed line in the first panel we show the effect of fixing @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath66 to their `` fiducial '' values , while the dashed lines in the top right and bottom panel indicate the effect of including the galaxies that are not identified as ellipticals in the angular separation test .",
    "first of all , note that the two independent tests are in remarkable agreement , and that both constrain @xmath35 quite strongly .",
    "the @xmath25 test gives @xmath125 ( at the 95% cl ) , while the @xmath28 test gives @xmath126 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath28 results are roughly independent of the subsample of ellipticals we use , although the results are less tight in the baseline case when only the four `` secure '' ellipticals are used ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : sis_constr ] .",
    "the two tests combined give @xmath127 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "therefore , the overall favored value of @xmath35 is actually smaller than the fiducial value of @xmath128 that has often been used to set constraints on cosmological parameters ( kochanek 1995 , 1996 , falco , kochanek & muoz 1998 , waga & miceli 1999 , cooray , quashnock & miller 1999 ) , and , not surprisingly , is in agreement with the value used in studies that tended to favor non - zero @xmath7 ( cheng and krauss , 1999 , chiba and yoshii 1999 ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath129 has also been obtained using the direct observations of early - type lens galaxies ( e.g. koopmans & treu 2002 get @xmath130 ) .",

    "we choose the same ranges for @xmath56 , @xmath66 and @xmath55 as in the sis case ( see sec .  [",

    "remarkably , we find that interesting constraints on @xmath53 are possible despite marginalizing over this large parameter space .",

    "the resulting constraints on the inner slope of the density profile are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnfw_constr ] .",
    "first , note that the total optical depth and angular separation tests ( top panels ) are in good agreement .",
    "the two tests together , when the likelihood function is marginalized over other parameters , yield the constraint @xmath194 at the 68% cl and @xmath2 at the 95% cl ( bottom left panel ) . as in the sis case , these results are insensitive to the exact ranges allowed for the luminosity function parameters .",
    "moreover , we have checked that the angular separation test is insensitive to the choice of lens data , i.e. whether we use the 4 single deflectors confirmed to be ellipticals , or all 9 single deflectors that are not identified as spirals . to be conservative",
    ", all results we quote correspond to the former choice and are represented by solid lines in fig .  [ fig : gnfw_constr ] ( for more on this choice , see sec .",

    "we also show the likelihood for the angular and redshift test combined using the _ three _ elliptical lenses with complete redshift and angular separation information ( @xmath195 ; bottom right panel ) , which we did not use in the analysis due to uncertain systematic effects in the selection of lens redshifts .",
    "it is clear that the combined angular and redshift test is consistent with the other tests , and combining it with the @xmath25-test would further strengthen the final constraint on @xmath53 , as shown with the dotted curve in the bottom left panel .",
    "although the favored slope is significantly steeper that the canonical nfw @xmath196 profile , it is expected that the shallow nfw profiles seen in simulations become steeper due to baryonic infall ( e.g. kochanek & white 2001 ) .",
    "the results of our analysis are in excellent agreement with such a scenario .",
    "furthermore , these constraints are in good agreement with direct modelling of the observed lenses ( muoz , kochanek & keeton 2001 , cohn et al.2001 , treu & koopmans 2002 , winn , rusin & kochanek 2002 ) which typically favors a steep , near - isothermal cusp .",
    "finally , the results are insensitive to the exact values of cosmological parameters : for example , marginalizing over the plausible values of the matter density @xmath131 $ ] produces negligible increase of the width of our contours .",
    "we also can constrain the gnfw concentration parameter @xmath145 and the density profile slope @xmath53 jointly . in fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_c0.joint ] we display the n - body determination of the concentration parameter as a function of @xmath53 , and overlay this with our lensing constraint on @xmath156 vs @xmath53 , using the @xmath25-test . for any given @xmath53 , we allow @xmath156 to be a free parameter , and retain the redshift and mass dependence of @xmath145 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_nbody ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the allowed value of @xmath53 reported above coincides with the overlap region between the n - body result and our lensing constraint . note , however , that lensing imposes constraints on the concentration that are independent of n - body results .",
    "in particular , if the galaxies indeed have pure nfw ( @xmath197 ) profile , lensing statistics implies that the concentration parameter @xmath156 has to be greater than 15 , which is in conflict with the results of n - body simulations .",
    "we mentioned previously that one of the great difficulties with using gravitational lensing statistics as a probe is that the parameters that describe the abundance of galaxies can depend on redshift .",
    "( in the gnfw case , the concentration parameter @xmath145 is allowed to vary with redshift , as predicted by numerical simulations . ) to make progress , essentially all authors in the past who wanted to use lensing statistics assumed that these functions were redshift - independent .",
    "in particular , one expects that the number density @xmath55 and the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath35 may be strongly dependent on redshift due to galaxy accretion and mergers ..    direct constraints on the redshift dependence of the luminosity and abundance of galaxies are still crude , made difficult by poor statistics and a variety of systematic effects . even rough agreement between various surveys has not been achieved .",
    "for example , while the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) , the cnoc2 survey ( lin et al . 1999 ) , and the cadis survey ( fried et al .",
    "2001 ) all observe an increase of @xmath55 for early - type galaxies between redshifts of zero and @xmath198 , the autofib survey ( ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) and the numerical simulations by nagamine et al.(2001 ) conclude just the opposite .",
    "it is clear that getting the redshift dependence of number densities and characteristic velocities per spectral type and their various covariances will take some time .",
    "keeton ( 2002 ) has argued that a variation in @xmath55 with @xmath199 can cancel out much of the cosmological sensitivity of lensing statistics .",
    "however , we note that this variation alone is probably unrealistic . at the same time",
    ", mergers and accretion will be expected to cause a variation @xmath35 , which will have the opposite effect of a variation in @xmath55 on lensing statistics , and indeed may overwhelm it . to accurately account for evolution , it is probably best to match onto n - body simulations of the galaxy mass function , which in fact suggest that the number density of galaxies with a specific value of @xmath35 is relatively constant with @xmath199 ( i.e.  bullock et al .",
    "2001b ) .    to estimate the maximal possible effect of evolution ( assuming an evolution in the galaxy number density only ) , we used an sis profile , which simplifies calculations . if one then considers a number density dependence of galaxies as suggested by lin et al .",
    "( 1999 )    @xmath200    one can estimate how the results would change for non - zero values of @xmath201 .",
    "for the @xmath25-test , the change is as expected : for example , for @xmath202 the number density increases by @xmath20360% ( assuming the average lens redshift is @xmath204 ) , which corresponds to the decrease in the favored @xmath35 by @xmath20310% in order to preserve agreement with the measured @xmath25 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : depend ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath99 test , the redshift - dependence of @xmath55 largely cancels out in the numerator and denominator of this quantity .",
    "therefore , as expected , the total optical depth is more sensitive to the redshift dependence of @xmath55 , while the angular distribution of lenses is not .",
    "again , we expect that the actual impact of evolution will be much less severe than that discussed above , because mergers and accretion will tend to produce a variation in @xmath35 with @xmath199 that will cancel the effect of the variation in @xmath55 .",
    "the use of strong gravitational lensing statistics in order to probe cosmology has a long history .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant uncertainty in the predictions of lensing statistics has to do with estimates of galaxy parameters , not cosmological ones . because of the recent revolutions in observational cosmology that have allowed us to pin down the basic cosmological parameters with relatively good accuracy , gravitational lensing statistics now provide us a new opportunity to probe the structure of galaxies and the trends of galaxy evolution .",
    "our results represent a first step in this regard .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite remarkable that , in spite of the paucity of lensing statistics at this time , we obtain non - trivial limits on galaxy properties . it is also significant that these limits are largely independent of cosmological uncertainties . since we are primarily interested here in constraining observational galaxy parameters we used the schechter luminosity function , which gives the number density of galaxies in terms of luminosity , rather than the mass function , which is more relevant for more massive halos associated with clusters ( @xmath46 ) .    assuming the sis density profile , we find that the mean velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies is small , with @xmath205 at 68% cl , consistent with a number of earlier estimates used in lensing analyses ( e.g. chiba & yoshii 1999 , cheng & krauss 2001 ) , but significantly smaller than the  canonical \" value of @xmath206 km / s often quoted in the literature . perhaps more significantly , assuming the generalized nfw density profile with inner slope @xmath207",
    ", we constrain @xmath53 to be in the range @xmath208 at 68% cl .",
    "this is definitely inconsistent with the @xmath197 slope advocated by n - body simulations for the dark matter halos profiles ; fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_c0.joint ] shows that a profile with @xmath197 could produce the observed lensing statistics only with an unreasonably high concentration ( @xmath209 ) . at the same time",
    ", it is a well - known fact that n - body simulations do not include additional physics , e.g. the baryonic infall , that makes the inner profiles of halos and galaxies steeper .",
    "consequently , our result for the density slope is in good agreement with the expectations , as well as with similar analyses ( e.g. keeton 2001 , kochanek & white 2001 , rusin & ma 2001 ) or direct modelling ( cohn et al . 2001 , treu & koopmans 2002 , winn , rusin & kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "the lack of high - separation events ( @xmath210 ) in jvas / class has been used to suggest that there are two populations of halos in the universe ( keeton 1998 , li & ostriker 2002 ) : small - mass galaxy - size halos with possibly steep density profiles ( @xmath211 ) , and large - mass halos with shallow density profiles ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "the former correspond to the elliptical galaxies we are interested in here , and our results confirm that a steep slope seems to be required to explain these events .",
    "there remain some issues that require further exploration . in particular",
    ", the total optical depth produces a likelihood function that tends to suggest a slope that is less steep than that favored by exploring the redshift dependence and angular splitting of lensing events .",
    "this may be an artifact of our limited statistics , but it could also signal the need to consider a more complicated , perhaps two component , galaxy distribution in order to consistently model lensing events .",
    "needless to say , the most significant factor not explicitly taken into account here is a possible redshift evolution of galaxy number density and velocity dispersion .",
    "very little is known observationally about the evolution of these quantities beyond @xmath213 . as we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolving ] , there are reasons to believe that the effects of evolution will not significantly alter the allowed parameter ranges we have determined here .",
    "finally , we note that there is great potential to improve these constraints as better statistics are obtained using current and future observational efforts .",
    "in particular , the deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al . 2002 ) will provide a velocity function for galaxies at redshift @xmath198 , which will allow one to explore the evolution of galaxy parameters with redshift with a much higher sensitivity than currently available .",
