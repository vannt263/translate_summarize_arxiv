    "in the family of the quaternary borocarbides _ r_ni@xmath2b@xmath2c , co - existence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism of the rare earth ions has been found at low temperatures for _ r _ = tm , er , ho , and dy ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of honi@xmath2b@xmath2c ,",
    "the transition temperatures for both ordering phenomena lie in the same temperature region of about 5 to 8  k. hence , this system offers an ideal possibility to study the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "three different magnetic structures have been identified for honi@xmath2b@xmath2c : a commensurate antiferromagnetic one with wave vector @xmath3 , an incommensurate structure with @xmath4 and an incommensurate structure with @xmath5 @xcite . while for flux - grown single crystals only an ordinary superconducting transition has been observed in zero magnetic field",
    ", the low - temperature properties of polycrystalline samples strongly depend on thermal treatment @xcite as well as on their chemical composition within a small but non - negligible homogeneity range @xcite .",
    "pure superconductivity co - existing with antiferromagnetism , re - entrant behaviour , as well as samples in a non - superconducting but magnetically ordered state down to at least 1.5  k have been found @xcite .",
    "the study of different polycrystalline samples can therefore reveal correlations between the complicated set of magnetic structures and the occurrence of superconductivity . in this paper",
    ", we will present results on a sample with pronounced re - entrant behaviour in zero magnetic field .",
    "( b ) and @xmath6 ( a ) and of the intensities of the magnetic reflections @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( d ) , corresponding to the commensurate @xmath10-axis , the incommensurate @xmath10-axis and the incommensurate @xmath11-axis modulated structure , respectively .",
    "the inset ( c ) shows an enlargement of the intensities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "all intensities are normalized by the calculated intensity for the fully magnetically ordered phase with the free ion value of @xmath12 for ho@xmath13 .",
    "the shaded area in ( b ) corresponds to the temperature interval where the @xmath11-incommensurate structure exists . ]",
    "the honi@xmath0@xmath1b@xmath0c sample was prepared by arc - melting stoichiometric amounts of the pure elements on a water - cooled copper hearth under argon atmosphere .",
    "10  at.-%  excess carbon were added to compensate for evaporation losses .",
    "the sample was remelted several times and then annealed for 16  days at 1100@xmath14c to ensure its homogeneity .",
    "phase purity was checked by x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "only minor traces of hob@xmath2c@xmath2 could be detected .",
    "the ac - susceptibility measurements were performed at 22  hz with an ac - amplitude of 0.1  mt .",
    "the neutron powder diffraction experiment was carried out at the multidetector instrument d1b at the ill in grenoble .",
    "the ac - susceptibility measurements can be seen in fig.[ltfarmin]b .",
    "the sample becomes superconducting at 7.1  k , re - enters the normal state below roughly 6.3  k , and finally becomes superconducting again at about 4.3  k. each transition between superconducting and normal state , and vice versa , is accompanied by a loss signal in the quadrature part of the susceptibility @xmath6 ( fig.[ltfarmin]a ) .",
    "the neutron scattering data in fig.[ltfarmin]d show first signs of long range magnetic ordering with the appearance of the two @xmath10-axis modulated structures at about 8  k. their tail exists well above the superconducting transition temperature whereas the @xmath11-axis modulated structure is confined to a very small temperature interval below @xmath15 ( see fig.[ltfarmin]c ) .",
    "this temperature region is highlighted by shading in the susceptibility plot and is exactly where the sample re - enters the normal state .",
    "it indicates that this structure is responsible for the observed pair - breaking which leads to re - entrant behaviour .",
    "this interpretation is in very good agreement with neutron scattering experiments on samples with non - magnetic dilutions on the ho - site @xcite .",
    "however , the normal state persists below the temperature where the @xmath11-incommensurate structure vanishes .",
    "below 5  k , only the @xmath10-commensurate groundstate is observed and superconductivity returns at 4.3  k."
