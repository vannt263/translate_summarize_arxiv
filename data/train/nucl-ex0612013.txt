    "the production of charmonium states in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been investigated since the mid 80s by the na38 collaboration  @xcite , followed in the 90s by na50  @xcite .",
    "the motivation is to search for the phase transition of nuclear matter from its normal state to a deconfined quark - gluon plasma , as predicted to occur , under extreme energy densities or temperatures , by non - perturbative qcd .",
    "in such a deconfined matter , charmonia states , in particular the j/@xmath1 vector - meson , have been predicted to be suppressed by debye colour screening  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the na50 experiment has shown that j/@xmath1 production in pb - pb collisions is significantly suppressed with respect to the expectations derived from the rates measured in proton , oxygen and sulphur - induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is a more loosely bound state than the j/@xmath1 , which opens the possibility that it may dissociate at lower energy densities in connection with critical scenarios , as predicted by recent lattice calculations  @xcite , but also be sensitive to other mechanisms , as absorption in nuclear matter or dissociation by co - moving hadrons .",
    "after the first results on @xmath1 production obtained by experiments na38  @xcite and na50  @xcite , the framework for a general understanding of charmonium dissociation due to critical transitions has recently opened up with new experimental results on j/@xmath1 suppression  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 production reported hereafter , performed with identical analysis procedures as for the j/@xmath1 , should help and internally constrain the various theoretical approaches which try to give a coherent overall picture of charmonium production and suppression .",
    "na50 is a fixed target experiment at the cern - sps optimized for the detection of muon pairs produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the main component of the apparatus is a muon spectrometer made of an air - core toroidal magnet surrounded by two sets of multi - wire proportional chambers and trigger hodoscopes .",
    "an appropriate hadron absorber separates the spectrometer from the target itself , allowing the experiment to run with a high intensity incident beam and a moderate spectrometer illumination .",
    "three independent detectors , located immediately downstream from the target region , measure the centrality of the reactions  a silicon strip multiplicity detector sampling the produced secondary charged particles , a pb - scintillating fibers electromagnetic calorimeter measuring the neutral transverse energy @xmath29 and a very forward hadronic calorimeter ( zero degree calorimeter ) , embedded in the hadron absorber , which essentially measures the energy of the beam spectator nucleons in the collision , @xmath30 .",
    "a beam hodoscope ( bh ) , located 25 m upstream from the target , allows to monitor and identify the incident beam and also provides an accurate time reference for trigger purposes",
    ". a detailed description of the na50 apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "this article is based only on the highest quality data samples collected by the experiment in years 1998 and 2000 when only one single target was used which , moreover , was placed in vacuum in year 2000 .",
    "these features have efficiently solved problems affecting previous data collections such as secondary fragment reinteractions within the target assembly leading to a centrality smearing on one hand and pb - air interactions simulating peripheral pb - pb collisions on the other .",
    "furthermore , the selected data have benefited from an upgraded track reconstruction treatment based on improved software algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the data were collected with a typical beam intensity of 11.4@xmath3110@xmath32 ions / s , over 4.8s bursts every 20s , at 158 gev per nucleon .",
    "the single pb target was 4 mm thick in 2000 ( 3 mm in 1998 ) , equivalent to 10% ( 7% ) of an interaction length .",
    "muon pairs are selected in the rapidity window @xmath33 @xmath34 and with a collins - soper angle @xmath35 , resulting in an acceptance of around 14% . on -",
    "target interactions are selected requiring the proper correlation between hits in the two planes of the multiplicity detector .",
    "this target selection procedure is 88% efficient for @xmath36  gev and 100% efficient for @xmath37  gev .",
    "it allows to unambiguously identify the most peripheral on - target interactions and , therefore , has now been applied to the pb - pb data samples collected both in 1998 and in 2000 .",
    "moreover , muons produced off - target are further excluded by a cut on the transverse distance , in the middle target plane , between the muon track extrapolated from the spectrometer and the beam axis .",
    "parasitic interactions occurring upstream from the target , mostly in the beam hodoscope , are rejected by a bh interaction detector and by anti - halo counters .",
    "multiple piled - up interactions are discarded by a shape analysis of the signal from the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "residual piled - up events are rejected by a 2@xmath38 cut in the @xmath39 correlation  @xcite .",
    "+ the opposite - sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum in the mass region of interest , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] , results from five different contributions  the resonances j/@xmath1 and @xmath0 , as well as the continuum formed by drell - yan , by open charm semi - leptonic decays and by the _",
    "unphysical _ combinatorial background originating mostly from uncorrelated @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays .",
    "in order to disentangle the different contributions and to provide the necessary ingredients for the determination of cross - sections , a monte - carlo simulation technique is used .",
    "it allows to determine both the acceptance of each physical process and the smearing of the corresponding detected muon pairs as they result from the actual experimental detector and selection criteria imposed on the data .",
    "each physical process is separately generated and its corresponding muon pairs are propagated through the detector exactly the way real muons do , which accounts , in particular , for multiple scattering and energy loss in the absorbers and for the limited acceptance of the apparatus .",
    "the resulting smearing is particularly visible in the j/@xmath1 and @xmath0 reconstructed shapes , entirely due to the experimental resolution of the apparatus .",
    "the resonances are generated in rapidity with a gaussian distribution of 0.6 units width .",
    "the transverse momentum used in the simulation follows the parametrization of a thermal distribution , d@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and first order , in the transverse mass , with @xmath44=236 mev .",
    "these parameters were tuned in order to reproduce the experimental spectra of the s - u collision system at 200 gev / c  @xcite and they account very well for pb - pb interactions at 158 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the drell - yan is evaluated with pythia  @xcite , using the grv lo 94  @xcite set of parton density functions , with a minimum 4-momentum transfer and @xmath45 domain as required by the na50 phase space window . at the born level ,",
    "dimuons are produced with zero @xmath46 ; to overcome this inadequate physical picture , a primordial @xmath47 inside the hadrons is considered , according to a gaussian with 0.8 gev / c width .",
    "the @xmath48 mesons are also generated with pythia , at leading order of qcd , using @xmath49 = 1.35 gev / c@xmath50 and a gaussian distributed @xmath47 with 1.0 gev / c width  @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial background , free from any simulation , is completely determined both in shape and in amplitude from the measured like - sign pair distributions according to @xmath51 .",
    "this method holds as long as the spectrometer acceptance does not depend on the muon charge , which is ensured by an appropriate selection of events .",
    "+ after the monte - carlo determination of the muon pair mass shapes of each physical process , their corresponding amplitudes are obtained from a fit to the opposite sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum of the selected events .",
    "the background contribution , already established through the procedure explained above , is fixed .",
    "the @xmath48 contribution , although tiny in the mass range of relevance for the @xmath0 amplitude determination and , moreover , practically uncorrelated with it , is roughly estimated from a separate fit in the dimuon mass range 1.7 - 2.2 gev / c@xmath50 .",
    "for this purpose , the corresponding drell - yan is deduced from the extrapolation of the muon pairs sampled above 4.2 gev / c@xmath50 , a mass region where drell - yan is the only contribution and is , therefore , unambiguously determined .",
    "the @xmath0 , j/@xmath1 and the whole drell yan amplitudes are obtained from a fit in the mass range 2.9 - 7.0 gev / c@xmath50 , with both the combinatorial background and @xmath48 contributions fixed .",
    "the set of parameters which maximize the log - likelihood function is found by the minuit package  @xcite , which also evaluates the function in the neighbourhood of the minimum , thus providing the parameter statistical uncertainties .",
    "one should notice the good @xmath52 of the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "details on the analysis method are given in  @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions implies special care with the data treatment , in particular in what concerns the identification of systematic sources , since this resonance yields a weak signal due both to its small dimuon branching ratio ( @xmath53 = ( 7.3  @xmath54  0.8 )  @xmath31  10@xmath55  @xcite ) and to its large suppression with increasing centrality of the collision .",

    "this absolute number of events must still be corrected for various detector inefficiencies , selection cut losses and acceptances in the na50 phase space window , as detailed in table  [ tab : cor ] .",
    "the main systematical uncertainty contributing to the errors of the acceptance values is the generation model assumed . in particular , if a fermi motion model of the nucleons inside the nucleus is taken into account , the spectrometer acceptance of the resonances changes by @xmath671.5% . in the case of drell - yan ,",

    "the @xmath0 absolute cross - section is affected by a systematic uncertainty of 7% , obtained as the quadratic sum of all uncertainties considered , namely the errors on the absolute normalizations , fit method , spectrometer acceptances and uncertainties associated with the monte - carlo inputs , like parton density functions and @xmath71-quark mass .",
    "the latter , although directly related to drell - yan and open charm theoretical uncertainties , indirectly influence the @xmath0 fitted normalization .",
    "the main contributions to the uncertainty in the @xmath0 yield are the luminosity calculation , 4% , and the chosen pdfs to generate drell - yan , 5.8% , estimated as the numerical change in the result when using cteq4l  @xcite instead of grvlo94",
    ". on the other hand , it has been verified that the more recent grvlo98  @xcite induces a variation of less than 1.5% on the cross - section measurement .",

    "the difference results from the cumulative effects of the new j/@xmath1 experimental line shape  @xcite and the higher number of tracks reconstructed .",
    "although the better description of the resonance tails would lead to a 3.5% smaller cross - section , the new offline software algorithms  @xcite deal much better with the high mwpc occupancy levels induced by the pb - pb interactions and result in a net _ increase _ of the final cross - section value .",

    "the constant behaviour of this ratio from p - be to pb - pb collisions shows that the drell - yan process is proportional to the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the na38/na50 phase space window .",
    "the study of the @xmath0 suppression as a function of centrality is based on 380 and 905 @xmath0 events collected in 1998 and 2000 , respectively , and analyzed as a function of their transverse energy used as the centrality estimator .",
