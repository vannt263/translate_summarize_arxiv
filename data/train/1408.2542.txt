    "for several decades binary transition - metal oxides and related compounds have attracted increasing attention as resistive - switching materials .",
    "these are materials which can be switched between a high- and a low - resistance states and are very promising candidates for the next generation non - volatile resistive random access memory ( rram ) * ? ? ?",
    "the resistive switching in many of these technologically relevant oxides is claimed to be based on the formation and disruption of highly - conductive filaments , through which the current flow is realized * ? ? ?",
    "however , still very little is known about the composition , structure and dimensions of these filaments .",
    "recent low - temperature conductivity and in situ current - voltage measurements confirmed that the conducting filaments in pt / tio@xmath5/pt @xcite , as well as fe - doped srtio@xmath6 @xcite are composed of ti@xmath3o@xmath4 and ti@xmath0o@xmath1 magnli phases and their mixtures .",
    "these compounds belong to the homologous series ti@xmath7o@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of ti oxides with tio@xmath5 and ti@xmath5o@xmath6 as the end members .",
    "structurally they are related with rutile : there are adjacent rutile - like chains of @xmath10 edge - sharing tio@xmath11 octahedra , running parallel to the pseudorutile @xmath12 axis ( see fig.[fig : fig_1 ] ) ; the octahedra at the end of each of the chains share their faces with the next pseudorutile chain . with the exception of ti@xmath5o@xmath6 ,",
    "these compounds posses a triclinic structure and they are mixed - valence compounds with two ti@xmath2 ( 3@xmath13 electronic configuration ) and ( @xmath14 ) ti@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ions per formula unit ( in an ionic picture ) .",
    "several members of this homologous series , as well as the isostructural vanadium magnli phases v@xmath17o@xmath8 , are known to exhibit phase transitions with temperature , at which their conductivity changes drastically ( it is the largest for @xmath18 and 5 and reduces for the members with higher @xmath10 ) .",
    "these transitions were interpreted in terms of the localization of the electrons in the cation sublattice .",
    "indeed , the presence of both ti@xmath2 and ti@xmath15 ions provides several possibilities of charge distribution at cation sites , resulting in various charge - ordered states .",
    "take ti@xmath3o@xmath4 for example , which undergoes two consecutive phase transitions with temperature : a semiconductor - semiconductor transition at 130  k and a semiconductor - metal transition at 150  k @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction studies @xcite on ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single - crystals revealed that at low temperatures ti@xmath2 ions are covalently bonded to form the so - called _ bipolarons _  singlet electron pairs ( ti@xmath2-ti@xmath2 pairs ) . in the low - temperature ( lt ) semiconducting phase",
    "these pairs order so that they occupy alternate pseudorutile chains . in the high - temperaure ( ht )",
    "phase the pairing is believed to be absent and all the ti - cations are in the same oxidation state ti@xmath19 , resulting in further increase of the conductivity and metallic behavior .",
    "the nature of the intermediate temperature ( it ) phase remains rather unclear , however it is commonly believed that the ( semiconductor - semiconductor ) transition from lt to it phase is accompanied with the reordering of the ti@xmath2-ti@xmath2 pairs @xcite .",
    "it was assumed that in the it phase bipolaros distribute in ti - chains with a long - range order that requires a fivefold superstructure ( bipolaron liquid state @xcite ) .",
    "later , the structure of the it phase was revisited and suggested to be more complicated with the presence of bipolarons and a long - range order of ti valences @xcite .",
    "recent photoemission experiments @xcite interpreted the it phase in ti@xmath3o@xmath4 as a highly anomalous state sandwitched between the mixed - valent fermi liquid ( ht phase ) and charge ordered mott - insulating phase ( lt phase ) .",
    "two distinct phase transitions were also observed in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , at 128  k and 139  k , accompanied by the conductivity decrease by a factor of 3 ( ref .  ) ( or 50 according to bartolomew and frankl @xcite ) . while lt and it phases are found to be semiconducting",
    ", the conductivity in the ht phase increases with increasing temperature , which means that this phase is not a true metal and its nature is not clear .",
    "compared to ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , for which a stable charge - ordered state was shown to exist at low temperature , the charge order in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is rather uncertain , since the number of ti ions in the pseudorutile chains is odd , preventing the formation of the ti@xmath2 long - range ordered pairs * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray studies performed by marezio _",
    "et al _ @xcite , did not reveal any localization of charges and/or formation of covalent bonds between the ti@xmath2 cations in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , in order to explain the semiconducting properties of the lt and it phases , which in ti@xmath3o@xmath4 are related with the formation of ti@xmath2-ti@xmath2 pairs , they suggested a microdomain structure of the material with ti@xmath2 mostly present at domain walls , making the detection of the charge localization and ti@xmath2-ti@xmath2 bonds formation by x - ray techniques rather impossible .",
    "the observed epr signal the authors associated with the presence of unpaired ti@xmath2 .",
    "watanabe @xcite has recently studied the structural changes across the phase transitions in magnli phases by means of raman spectroscopy .",
    "he observed two semicondutor - semiconductor transitions , at 137  k and 130  k , and revealed a fine structure of the lt phase , somewhat resembling the it phase of ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "he suggested a considerable disorder for the lt phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and a rather itinerant nature of the 3@xmath20 electrons in the it and ht phases as in the ht phase of ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "the author did not observe any clear tendency as to the nature of the charge ordering in the considered magnli phases and concluded that in the compounds with odd @xmath10 like ti@xmath0o@xmath1 the charge order is unstable .",

    "in contrast to a commonly accepted bipolaronic picture of the metal - insulator transition in these compounds , which is attributed to the strong electron - lattice coupling , the authors proposed their own explanations of the physics behind the phase transitions .",
    "the remarkably enhanced pressure effect on the phase transition temperatures as @xmath10 goes from 6 to 4 the authors explained by a delicate interplay between the electron - lattice coupling and electron correlations . in this respect charge ordering in ti@xmath3o@xmath4 is explained to be due to a dominant electron correlations with a subsequent bipolarons formation by an electron - lattice coupling .",
    "ti@xmath11o@xmath22 , on the contrary , is believed to be a small polaron insulator due to a prevailing electron - lattice coupling .",
    "ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is suggested to be in between these two extreme cases .",
    "the formation of small polarons , localized on one atomic site and randomly distributed over the lattice , explains rather well the unclear charge distribution in higher @xmath10 magnli phases , observed in earlier experimental works @xcite .",
    "the substantial curie contribution , observed in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 at low temperatures @xcite , which can be associated with the presence of upaired localized moments , is also in line with the proposed small polaron picture .",
    "a distinct pressure dependence of the resistivity in the ht phase of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 allowed the authors to assume that the system is just at the crossover region from large to small polarons .",
    "such crossover in the systems with intermediate electron - coupling is often associated with a metal - insulator transition .    as for the magnetic properties ,",
    "ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , as well as ti@xmath3o@xmath4 and ti@xmath11o@xmath22 phases show antiferromagnetic ( afm ) behavior with nel temperature ( @xmath23 ) of about 130  k @xcite . according to magnetic susceptibility measurements in ti@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", there are two transitions which occur at 128 and 138 k , in contrast to ti@xmath3o@xmath4 with only one transition in magnetic susceptibility * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath23 is very close to the phase transition temperature , which allows one to relate the magnetic ordering with the phase transitions observed in this compound . at low temperatures ( @xmath24  k ) the measurements show a curie behavior , while for the 40  k@xmath25128  k the temperature - independent susceptibility might be due to van vleck paramagnetism . susceptibility in the ht phase is clearly temperature independent .",
    "based on the measured molar susceptibility in ti oxides , the effective magnetic moment for ti@xmath0o@xmath1 was calculated to be of 0.245  @xmath26 and it was concluded that a relatively small percentage of the unpaired electrons ( 7.4% ) contributes to the curie - weiss behavior , while a large percentage ( 92.6% ) contributes to its metallic ( free electron gas ) behavior ; the small weiss constant indicates that these spins do not interact strongly @xcite .",
    "although rather well studied experimentally , there is very little known about the mechanism behind the transitions in magnli phases theoretically .",
    "up to today , there are only a few dft calculations on ti@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite , and to our knowledge , they are completely lacking for higher-@xmath10 phases .",
    "therefore , in this work we aimed to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the phase transitions in magnli phases like ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , which , due to its high electrical conductivity and chemical stability , has a promising application not only in electrochemical engineering , but even in medicine as a neural stimulation electrode @xcite . with this aim we performed dft calculations in order to illuminate the changes in its electronic structure on a microscopic level and",
    "establish relations between the structural , electronic and magnetic properties and their implications for conductive phenomena .",
    "we believe that the obtained results will be helpfull in interpreting the physics of resistively switching ti oxides .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of the different phases of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 were studied within the dft , using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite with projector augmented potentials ( paw ) @xcite .",
    "kinetic energy cut - off of 450 ev and @xmath27 @xmath28-points mesh was used for the unit cell of 28 atoms .",
    "the exchange correlation functional was treated within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "gga+@xmath29 approximation in dudarev s approach @xcite with @xmath29 applied to @xmath30 states of ti was used to take into account the electronic correlations .",
    "the structural data for all three phases have been taken from the ref .  .",
    "the structure optimization was performed only for the lt phase with the aim to find the ground state of the system under study . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the spin - orbit coupling in our calculations , and we restrict ourselves to the collinear spins only .",
    "it is known that oxygen deficient rutile tio@xmath31 can be transformed into a magnli phase , when oxygen nonstoichiometry is sufficiently high ( @xmath32 @xcite ) . at such concentrations ,",
    "oxygen vacancies arrange into extended defects , resulting in the shear plane structure ( see fig.[fig : fig_1](c ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the defect states appear in the band gap close to the conduction band minimum , which are occupied by the electrons of ti@xmath2 ions .",
    "numerous studies on tio@xmath31 , including recent hybrid functional calculations @xcite , have reported on the effect of the electronic correlations on the position of these defect states and the distribution of ti@xmath2 ions . for ti@xmath3o@xmath4 or ti@xmath0o@xmath1 with similar peculiarities of the electronic structure , @xmath33 approach or hybrid functionals",
    "were used to correctly account for the correlation effects and were able to reproduce the ground state properties of the phases @xcite .",
    "however , the correlations might be less effective in the phases with larger @xmath10 ( i.e. , with smaller density of 3@xmath20 electrons ) , as it was assumed in ref . based on the observed lack of the systematic trend in charge ordering in different magnli phases .    in order to ilucidate the importance of electron correlations for the charge localization in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , we have peformed calculations within gga+@xmath29 approach , assuming the unit - cell model for the order / disorder of the ti@xmath2 and ti@xmath15 ions . to cover the limits of weak and strong electron interactions ,",

    "a small band gap of about 0.1  ev between the occupied and unoccupied @xmath30 states of ti opens in both spin channels at @xmath39  ev , and it increases up to 0.7  ev at @xmath35  ev ( see tab.[tab : table_1 ] ) .",

    "while the conduction band is mainly contributed by ti @xmath30 states , the valence band originates from the oxygen @xmath44 states ( with a small admixture of ti @xmath30 states due to ti - o bonds formation ) and it is separated from the gap states by an energy interval , which is much larger than the fundamental gap",

    "in summary , we have performed first - principles calculations to study the electronic and magnetic propeties of the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 crystal , which belongs to the homologous series of ti@xmath17o@xmath8 oxides , known as magnli phases . from our results",
    "it is difficult to conclude on which charge distribution is realized in this material at different temperatures , since for all three phases we find several quasidegenerate magnetic solutions .",
    "we therefore assume that the charge order within the cation sublattice in ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is not unique and thus unstable , which makes its experimental detection at finite temperatures difficult .",
    "we suggest that in contrast to ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , the formation of ti@xmath2-ti@xmath2 pairs in this compound is less likely , although not completely impossible , since a bipolaronic state is only slightly higher in energy than the ground state .",
    "our calculations perfomed for all three phases showed that crystal structure changes at the transitions make a minor influence on the electronic structure of the compounds .",
    "although the electronic correlations are important for the stabilization of the insulating ground state , the phase transitions in this compound are related to a greater extent to a reordering of the unpaired spins .",

    ", where the author considered different scenarios for the metal - nonmetal transitions in transition metal oxides and sulfides .",
