    "over the last several years , complementary observations of comets with both single - dish telescopes and interferometric arrays , have shed new light on the abundance , production rate , distribution and formation of molecules in cometary comae .",
    "recently , milam et al .",
    "( 2006 ) employed this method to investigate the origins of cometary formaldehyde ( h@xmath5co ) by comparing observations with both the arizona radio observatory ( aro ) 12 m single - dish telescope and the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array . from this investigation toward comet",
    "c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) , the authors clearly showed that the distribution and abundance of h@xmath5co must be coming from a source other than the comet nucleus .",
    "the extended source of h@xmath5co may be due to an enhanced production of this molecule , ( @xmath34@xmath8 larger ) from grains consisting of silicates and organic material ( milam et al .",
    "2006 ) , or possibly from the photodissociation of a larger parent species such as methanol ( ch@xmath0oh ) ( hudson , moore & cook 2005 ) .",
    "these complementary observations , however , are very difficult to obtain , as most of the molecular observations toward comets are performed using solely single - dish telescopes or interferometric arrays , depending on the telescope available at the time as the comet approaches the inner solar system and perigee .    multiple facility collaborations for cometary observations are necessary if we are to further understand the formation , excitation and distribution of organic cometary material .",
    "recent cometary models of the abundance of organic material suggest oort cloud comets may have had an origin in the giant planet region , where they were thermally and chemically processed , before being ejected into the oort cloud ( weissman 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations comparing long- and short - period comets suggest distinct classes - organic `` rich '' , `` normal '' , and `` depleted '' ( bonev et al .  2008 ; mumma et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the current sample size is too limited to accurately characterize each class of comets .",
    "it should also be noted that many of the comets described as organic `` rich '' have undergone breakup or fragmentation events , thus exposing more internal , unprocessed material than an object just entering the inner solar system ( bonev et al .",
    "so , the question persists , how does the classification of organic `` rich '' , `` normal '' or `` depleted '' hold with regards to comets that are for example , dust rich versus dust poor , having undergone a recent breakup , or bear high abundances of hypervolatile species ?",
    "the organic species examined in this study , methanol ( ch@xmath0oh ) , methyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0cn ) and ethylene glycol ( [ ch@xmath5oh]@xmath5 ) are believed to be parent species directly sublimated off the cometary ices in the nucleus . since the first reported single - dish detections of cometary ch@xmath0oh towards comet brorsen - metcalf ( 1989  o ) and comet austin ( 1989  c1 ) ( colom et al .",
    "1990 ) , ch@xmath0oh remains the most abundant large ( @xmath95 atoms ) organic ( containing a c - atom ) molecule measured in cometary ices . in a recent review by charnley & rodgers ( 2008 )",
    ", ch@xmath0oh has a measured abundance range relative to h@xmath5o between 1 - 4% . however , aperture synthesis observations of cometary ch@xmath0oh are very rare and no high spatial resolution data of this molecule currently exists . similarly , single - dish observations of ch@xmath0cn and ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 also suggest a purely nuclear origin ( biver et al .  2002 , crovisier et al .",
    "ch@xmath0cn , as well as hc@xmath0n , may be parent species that would increase the abundance of the cn radical as well as c@xmath5 in the coma . yet",
    ", current observations do not preclude the possibility of ch@xmath0cn having its own parent species ( bockele - morvan et al .",
    "in addition , the high abundance of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 observed in comet hale - bopp at high spatial resolution also strongly suggests a nuclear origin . to date",
    ", complementary observations of the same transitions of either ch@xmath0cn or ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 with another facility were not available to follow - up on the claimed distribution of these species in the coma and their possible formation pathways .    in this paper , we report on complementary observations of cometary ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0cn and ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 taken with the bima array near hat creek , ca and the aro 12 m telescope on kitt peak , az toward comets c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) and c/2002 t7 ( linear ) . from these observations",
    ", we continued to investigate the abundance , production rate , distribution and formation of molecules in comets by directly comparing the measurements of these organic species with different telescopes .",
    "our data supports the hypothesis that ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0cn and ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 are primarily parent species , generated by direct sublimation of cometary ices contained in the nucleus .",
    "our observations of comet hale - bopp with the bima array constitute one of the earliest detections of cometary ch@xmath0oh with an interferometer .",
    "these measurements were taken using the `` soft '' c configuration of the bima array from 1997 march 24 to april 03 .",
    "data were acquired in the interferometric ( cross - correlation ) mode with nine antennas . the minimum baseline for these observations was @xmath315 m and the maximum baseline was @xmath3139 m. the average resulting full width half power synthesized beam size was @xmath38@xmath7@xmath810@xmath7 for the observations .",
    "the quasar 0102 + 584 was used to calibrate the antenna based gains and the absolute amplitude calibration of this source was based on planetary observations and is accurate to within @xmath320% .",
    "the spectral windows containing the transitions had a bandwidth of 25 mhz and were divided into 256 channels for a spectral resolution of 0.1 mhz per channel .",
    "however , to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in each window , the data were averaged over two channels giving an effective spectral resolution of 0.2 mhz per channel .",
    "all data were first corrected to jpl ephemeris reference orbit 139 .",
    "the data were then combined and imaged using the miriad software package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) . to include all the data from the comet with multiple tracks , the data were inverted in _ u - v _ space .",

    "the accepted route to the formation of ch@xmath0cn in interstellar environments is ch@xmath55 + hcn , a collision complex is formed that equilibrates to ch@xmath0cnh@xmath18 + @xmath58 ( herbst , 1985 ) ; then ch@xmath0cnh@xmath18 combines with an electron to form ch@xmath0cn + h. our observations of ch@xmath0cn show that it is present close to the cometary nucleus , indicating direct sublimation off cometary ices .",
    "however , the excitation of the transitions we observed of ch@xmath0cn takes place at a smaller radii where the density is higher , and this molecule may be present as well at larger radii .",
    "however , the true spatial scale and scale length of ch@xmath0cn needs to be verified by interferometric observations .",
    "finally , the non - detection of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 with the aro 12 m gives insight into the formation of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 as well as the possibility of detecting ch@xmath5ohcho .",
    "if the transition detected by the 30 m is indeed from cometary ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 , in @xmath204.2 , we found the predicted distribution of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 toward comet hale - bopp was calculated to be d@xmath69@xmath7 ( @xmath68500 km ) , again suggesting direct sublimation off cometary ices or an enhanced production in the inner coma .",
    "presumably , as with the formation of ch@xmath0oh and ch@xmath0cn in interstellar environments , ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 would be formed in the ism and then seeded into cometary ices . currently , there is no accepted gas phase interstellar formation mechanism that can lead to the production of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 .",
    "however , there are several formation pathways using surface chemistry which may occur on icy grain mantles .",
    "for example , to form ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 and ch@xmath5ohcho , formaldehyde ( h@xmath5co ) produces ch@xmath5ohcho in an aqueous formose reaction , which can then be hydrogenated to form ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 ( e.g. , see walker 1975 ) .",
    "charnley ( 2001 ) predicts that ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 and ch@xmath5ohcho could be formed by direct hydrogenation reactions , starting from ketene ( ch@xmath5co ) on grain surfaces . finally , hudson & moore ( 2000 ) showed that proton irradiated ch@xmath0oh on icy interstellar grain mantles can lead to the formation of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 .",
    "thus , there appear to be several ways to form and embed ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 into cometary ices .",
    "we presented an interferometric and single dish study of cometary molecules toward comets c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) and c/2002 t7 ( linear ) using the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer at 3 mm and the arizona radio observatory ( aro ) 12 m telescope at 2 mm .",
    "the overall conclusions from our analysis of these data are :    1 .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh hale - bopp data are well fit by an excitation temperature of t@xmath27=105@xmath15 k and a total beam - averaged column density of n@xmath28=@xmath32  @xmath30 .",
    "assuming a nuclear origin for ch@xmath0oh and using a monte carlo model , we find an average ch@xmath0oh production rate from both instruments of @xmath34@xmath31.3@xmath810@xmath35 s@xmath17 or @xmath34/@xmath36@xmath31.3% at @xmath3 1 au .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh aro 12 m linear data centered around 157.26 ghz are best fit by an excitation temperature of t@xmath27=35@xmath15 k and a total beam - averaged column density of n@xmath28=2.2@xmath10.3@xmath59  @xmath30 and thus , a production rate @xmath34@xmath32.0@xmath810@xmath43 s@xmath17 or @xmath34/@xmath36=1.5% at 0.3 au .",
    "3 .   from the combination of the single - dish and aperture synthesis observations of ch@xmath0oh",
    ", we find the distribution of ch@xmath0oh toward comet hale - bopp is well described by a spherical outflow with an increase in column density closer to the cometary nucleus .",
    "the data presented in the array images show no evidence of significant enhanced production of ch@xmath0oh in the extended coma or from jets as any extended emission is completely resolved out by the array .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn 12 m hale - bopp data is best fit by an excitation temperature , t@xmath27=200@xmath110 k and a total beam - averaged column density , n@xmath28=2.6@xmath10.3@xmath60  @xmath30 . assuming a nuclear origin for ch@xmath0cn and using a monte carlo model , we find an average ch@xmath0cn production rate of @xmath42@xmath31.7@xmath810@xmath43 s@xmath17 or @xmath42/@xmath36@xmath30.017% at @xmath3 1 au .",
    "a comparison between the single - dish observations from the aro 12 m and the iram 30 m of ch@xmath0cn suggest that the aro observations are beam diluted .",
    "the excitation of the transitions observed of ch@xmath0cn takes place at a smaller radii where the density is higher and suggest a nuclear origin of ch@xmath0cn .",
    "the non - detection of a previously claimed transition of cometary ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 toward comet hale - bopp with the aro 12 m telescope indicates a compact distribution of emission on the order of @xmath69@xmath7 ( @xmath68500 km ) .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the cometary production of ( ch@xmath5oh)@xmath5 is direct sublimation off cometary ices from the nucleus .",
