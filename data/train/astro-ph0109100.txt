    "3c273 is the most closely observed target for studies of the ly@xmath0 forest at low - redshift .",
    "as shown in table 1 ( next page ) , it has been observed by fuse and each of the hubble spectrographs ",
    "fos , ghrs , and in this past year , the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "it is a cinch for early observation with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) scheduled to be installed on hst in early 2004 .",
    "this interest in 3c273 is for good reason : as the brightest agn at a significant redshift ( z=0.158 ) in the sky , it offers the best opportunity to explore the low - redshift ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "this opportunity was not lost on ray and john bahcall .",
    "in fact , the first major result of hst came from ghrs and fos spectroscopy of 3c  273 : the rate of evolution of absorbers , i.e. the rate at which absorbers of a given column density disappear from view , slows dramatically at @xmath8 ( morris et al .",
    "1991 ; bahcall et al . 1991 ) . the survival of hi - absorbing systems to the present epoch , which was predicted by ray and his colleagues ( bechtold , weymann et al .",
    "1987 ) , is thought to be a consequence of a lower ionizing background at @xmath8 , reflecting a decline in the quasar population after @xmath9 ( dav et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that low@xmath10 and high@xmath10 absorbing systems having the same column density belong to different density / structure regimes .",
    "for example , an absorption feature of a given column density arising in a filament in the low-@xmath10 igm would arise in a relative void at high - redshift .",
    "this puts investigators of the low@xmath10 igm at a disadvantage with respect to our high-@xmath10 colleagues .",
    "we have to pry out weak absorption features to explore physical systems that would produce saturated absorbers at high redshift .",
    "this is why the stis spectrum of 3c  273 is so important .",
    "for the first time , we can measure absorbing systems down to a completeness limit of log@xmath212.3 , thereby probing these weak absorbers that are predicted to be physically equivalent to high - redshift forest absorbers .",
    "the top panel of figure 4 shows the number density distribution , @xmath12(@xmath5)@xmath13 , for both 3c  273 and the simulations .",
    "the turnover in this distribution at low column densities allows a rough estimate of the completeness limit of lines , and is seen to be roughly @xmath14  @xmath15 ; we are working on a more thorough analysis of completeness in this sample . the observed slope for 3c  273",
    ", @xmath16 is slightly steeper than that estimated by penton et al .",
    "( 2000 ; c.f .",
    "shull , this conference ) but is nearly exactly the same as that found by dav and tripp ( table 2 ) .",
    "both our observations and simulations have slopes ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) that are significantly steeper than at @xmath19 ( see table 2 ) . at higher column densities ,",
    "the @xmath12(@xmath5 ) distribution flattens somewhat ( @xmath20 according to shull , this conference ) and comes into basic agreement with the high - redshift slope ( kim et al .",
    "the steeper slope at low column densities indicates that higher column - density lines are evolving away faster than are lower column - density ones , in agreement with findings from the hst quasar absorption - line key project ( weymann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the agreement in amplitude indicates that the ionizing background assumed in the simulations is close to correct ( within the framework of this cosmology and simulation ; see discussion in dav & tripp ) ; it seems to suggest the intensity predicted by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) is roughly correct ( within a factor of a few ) , as suggested by the analysis of dav & tripp .",
