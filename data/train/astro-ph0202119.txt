    "hd  130948 is a triple system discovered by @xcite using the university of hawaii adaptive optics system ( hkpaa ) in the course of an imaging survey of low - mass companions to nearby young stars using the gemini north telescope .",
    "the hd  130948 ( gliese  564 , hr  5534 ) system consists of a g2v primary star and a binary companion at a separation of 263 from the primary .",
    "the binary companions are separated by 0134 , or 2.4  au at a distance of 17.9  pc determined by _",
    "@xcite confirmed the common motion of the members of the triple system with a baseline of 7 months to reject the chance projection of background sources . by using the ao system on the subaru telescope",
    ", we obtained individual spectra of each component to confirm the substellar nature of the faint companions , hd  130948b and c.",
    "the spectroscopic observation was made on ut 2001 may 3 using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; tokunaga et al .",
    "1998 ; kobayashi et al . 2000 ) with the 8.2  m subaru telescope in conjunction with its adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite .",
    "the subaru ao system , which is equipped with a 36-element curvature sensor , is installed at the front end of the telescope cassegrain port .",
    "a medium - resolution grism was used with a 010 slit in the 22 mas camera section of the ircs to provide spectra with a resolving power of 8001000 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "hd 130948a was used as the reference source for the ao system .",
    "the slit was put along the position angle of hd  130948b and c to cover them simultaneously .",
    "the spectra were recorded by nodding the telescope by 1  along the slit to subtract the sky emission .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 1200 s in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "a nearby b8v star hd  164352 was observed as a spectroscopic standard at similar airmass . the standard star is bright enough to give nearly the same ao correction as for hd 130948a .",
    "the spectroscopic flat field was obtained at the end of the night with a halogen lamp .",
    "the seeing was 0405 at 2.2  throughout the observing period .    because of the close proximity and the large difference in luminosity between the primary and companions , the sky background in the spectrum is affected by the gradient in the wing of the point - spread function ( psf ) of the bright primary .",
    "after a pair subtraction of the sky the residual background slope was removed by interpolating the background on both sides of the companion .",
    "we obtained the one - dimensional spectra using the iraf aperture extraction package after flat - fielding and bad - pixel correction .",
    "special attention was paid to the adjustment of the aperture width .",
    "figure [ prof1 ] shows crosscuts of the observed spectrogram in the spatial direction with an overlay of the standard star profile normalized at the peak of each object .",
    "the fwhm of a standard star is as sharp as 01 and 008 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , respectively .",
    "however , the intensity of the first diffraction ring is significant .",
    "the separation between the centroid and the peak of the first diffraction ring for an ideal diffraction - limited image of the 8.2  m circular opening should be 007 and 009 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the angular separation of 013 between hd  130948b and c. consequently , the energy of hd  130948b in the first ring as well as the halo overlaps with hd  130948c .",
    "this may produce similar spectral signatures in both components that may be misleading .",
    "we calculated the contamination expected with the standard star psf .",
    "the flux contamination of c by b within the 3 pixel ( 0067 ) aperture width is 25% and 22% in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , respectively .",
    "the contamination of b by c is @xmath320% .",
    "the extraction aperture width of the standard star is set to the same as that of the objects . to provide the correct weight to the optimal extraction method @xcite , the statistical error in the 2d spectrogram image",
    "is calculated by combining the readout noise and the shot noise from the sky emission and psf spillover from the primary .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed by fitting about 20 emission lines of the argon arc lamp of the subaru telescope calibration unit with a linear function .",
    "the intrinsic stellar lines in the standard star spectra , which are mostly atomic hydrogen lines , were difficult to remove because of their superposition with the telluric absorption lines .",
    "only six of them at 1.588  ( br10 ) , 1.641  ( br8 ) , 1.681  ( br7 ) , 1.737  ( br6 ) , 2.166  ( br@xmath4 ) , and 2.374  ( pf20 ) were fit with a lorentzian profile and subtracted before division . the small discrepancy in the airmass between the standard and the object",
    "was corrected by rescaling the standard star spectra according to beer s law .",
    "rough flux calibration relative to the standard star was made in each band by assuming the intrinsic spectra of a b8v star is represented by a planck function of @xmath5 10700  k @xcite .",
    "to determine the spectral types of hd  130948b and c , we compared the object spectra with template spectra of low - mass stars published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we found none of the template spectra match well with the object spectra .",
    "the continua of the object spectra were too steep to be a low - mass star , though the low - mass nature is apparent in the strong absorption of h@xmath6o at both ends of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "we concluded that the continuum slope was affected by the ao correction .",
    "not only a little offset from a narrow slit , but also slight difference in seeing can result in the variation of the continuum slope because of the sensitive wavelength dependency of the encircled energy on the ao performance ( m. goto et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the variation of the continuum slope from exposure to exposure was sometimes as much as 10% per 0.1  @xmath7 m .",
    "most of the time the difference was well represented by a simple linear function .",
    "because of the uncertainty of the continuum slope , we had to correct the object spectra by multiplying a linear function before comparison with templates .",
    "the strength of h@xmath6o absorption increases with spectral type , and the spectral change between any two spectral types is not a linear function .",
    "in other words , we can not convert the spectrum of an l1 star to an l8 star by just multiplying a linear function .",
    "therefore , in principle , we can determine the spectral type of an object uniquely by matching both the h@xmath6o absorption with a template spectrum , even if we have a linear continuum slope uncertainty .",
    "first , we assumed hd  130948b ( or c ) is a certain spectral type , and estimated how much linear continuum correction is required to best match the object spectrum with the template spectrum of the assumed spectral type .",
    "we calculated the cross - correlation between the object spectrum and the template spectrum as a function of the steepness of the applied linear function correction .",
    "the slope of the function is determined so that the cross - correlation between the corrected object spectrum and the template spectrum is highest .",
    "we repeated this procedure for each spectral type from l1 to l8 .",
    "second , we investigated how well it matched each spectral type from l1 to l8 .",
    "the value of the cross correlation calculated above peaks at l3l5 in the @xmath1 band and at l1l5 in the @xmath2 band . considering the simultaneous match in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands ,",
    "we conclude both hd  130498b and c agree best with the template for l4 @xmath0 1 .",
    "this is consistent with the spectral type of l2 @xmath0 2 determined independently by @xcite .",
    "the final object spectra after correction are shown in figure [ spec1 ] with overlay of the best - matched template spectra , 2massw j0036 + 18 ( l4 ) .",
    "the spectra were binned by 2 pixels along the dispersion direction .",
    "the spectra of hd  130948b and c turn out to be very similar to each other in detail and are almost twins , except that hd  130948b is 0.20.3  mag brighter than c. the deep absorption bandhead of the co molecule at 2.32.4  @xmath7 m is conspicuous .",
    "the presence of absorption lines of ( 2.209  @xmath7 m ) and ( 1.516  @xmath7 m ) supports the idea that these are low mass stars .",
    "the absorption band of ch@xmath8 is not seen .",
    "this is in good agreement with the conclusion that hd  130948b and c are not later than mid l - type stars .",
    "a series of the `` unidentified '' absorption features reported by @xcite at 1.58 , 1.613 , and 1.627  @xmath7 m can be all attributed to the feh molecule @xcite .",
    "lines noted by @xcite and @xcite are marked in the figures .",
    "the range of spectral types derived above corresponds to an effective temperature of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "on the basis of moderate x - ray activity , a fast rotation period ( @xmath10 7.8 days ) , and photospheric lithium abundance , the age of the primary should be 0.6 @xmath0 0.2  gyr @xcite .",
    "on the other hand k. fuhrmann ( 2001 , private communication ) finds that hd  130948a may be a member of the ursa major stream , which has estimated age of 0.3 to 0.65  gyr @xcite .",
    "figure [ bara1 ] is a reproduction of the evolutionary tracks of various low - mass stars of solar metallicity calculated by @xcite .",
    "regardless of the uncertainty in the age determination of the hd  130948 system , the estimated masses for hd  130948b and c are under the sustainable hydrogen burning limit , 0.075  m@xmath11 for solar metallicity , for both companions , and the most likely mass of the object is 0.0400.065  m@xmath11 .",
    "we have presented moderate - resolution near - infrared spectra of the close binary companions recently discovered near hd  130948 .",
    "the general spectral features of the companions , hd  130948b and c , are very similar . based on a direct comparison with template spectra of low - mass stars",
    ", we have determined the spectral type of hd  130948b and c is l4 @xmath0 1 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite , who found a spectral type of l2 @xmath0 2 for the binary companions .",
    "if we take the young age of the primary star ( 0.30.8  gyr ) into account , then hd  130948b and c are binary brown dwarfs .",
    "we thank t. geballe , s. leggett , i. neill reid , and their collaborators for making the template spectra available in machine readable form for use in figure [ spec1 ] .",
    "we also thank i. baraffe and collaborators for making the tabular data available at their ftp site for use in figure [ bara1 ] .",
    "we thank all the staff and crew of the subaru telescope and naoj for their valuable assistance obtaining these data and their continuous support for ircs construction .",
