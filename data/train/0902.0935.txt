    "in this work we consider directional rfs . given a classical , external rf , one can measure the projection of a spin-@xmath8 particle along a specific direction , where the @xmath9 possible outcomes @xmath10 , correspond to the projectors @xmath11 .    without an external rf ,",
    "the experimenter can only measure relational degrees of freedom of the particle and the coherent state @xmath12 .",
    "the task is thus to estimate the relative angle between them using only rotationally invariant operations .",
    "an optimal procedure consists in performing the projective measurement onto the subspaces of total spin @xmath4 of two spins  @xcite , which can take the values @xmath13 . when the outcome @xmath14 of total spin is observed , we associate the spin component @xmath15 along the direction of the bounded rf to the system . in this way",
    "the spin projection measurement relative to a bounded rf simulates the one relative to an unbounded rf .",
    "the projectors associated to subspaces of total spin are @xmath16 these can be expressed in terms of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath17 and are given by @xmath18 . using the asymptotic properties of the clebsch - gordan coefficients",
    "@xcite it can be shown that @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that the relational measurement , with increasingly larger bounded rf , tends to the measurement with unbounded rf .",
    "a more general way to exploit relative degrees of freedom would be to encode information in rotationally invariant subsystems .",
    "for example , three spin-@xmath21 particles possess a two - level invariant subsystem in the subspace of total spin @xmath21 .",
    "thus , one rotationally invariant qubit ( quantum bit ) can be encoded in three physical ones and six spin-@xmath21 particles ( three for alice and three for bob ) would allow perfect violation of bell s inequalities with no need of a rotational rf .",
    "in this work we do not consider such general schemes .",
    "rather , we study the situations in which `` system '' and `` quantum reference frame '' are separated - resembling the conventional situation in experiments in which `` system '' and `` classical reference frame '' are separated .",
    "this will allow us to investigate quantum features of systems as the bounded quantum reference frames approach the classical limit .    in the bell experiment each of the observers chooses between two or more measurement settings , corresponding , for example , to measurements of spin components along different directions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ... in our scenario",
    "this choice corresponds to the use of coherent states @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ... pointing to different directions as rfs . here",
    "@xmath26 is the eigenstate with the maximal eigenvalue of the spin component along the direction @xmath27 .",
    "one possible way to prepare such states is to apply an appropriate rotation to the given coherent state @xmath28 pointing towards @xmath2 axis . since , however , alice and bob are assumed to have no rf , we consider the following operational realization . in",
    "every experimental run a third party ( charlie ) sends to both alice and bob one coherent state for each possible setting , together with the entangled pair to be measured .",
    "each coherent state is prepared along the direction which would be chosen when classical rf were used . having no rf for directions",
    ", alice can not know the angles of the different coherent states , but she can still distinguish between them ( for example , charlie can send them with a short , agreed , time delay ) , then alice can decide which one to use as a rf , allowing the freedom of choice necessary in a bell experiment .    in an alternative implementation , charlie chooses the setting and sends only the corresponding ( one ) coherent state . in this case no additional resources than those actually used are distributed , but the freedom of choice of the two observers is not strictly satisfied .",
    "one could think of more complicated schemes for ensuring that ( e.g. , introducing more agents that share a global rf with charlie , but are space - like separated , such that they can perform the settings choice under locality conditions ) , however , in the present work the focus is not on a strict disproof of local realistic theories , but rather on the ability to measure quantum correlations under the restriction of bounded rf .",
    "it is here assumed that the channel between charlie and the observers is subject to a collective noise , that is to say , all the particles sent to one observer undergo the same unknown rotation ( but a different rotation occurs in different runs and for the different observers ) , this is important since we want to exploit relative degrees of freedom .",
    "such an assumption could be reasonable in some quantum communication schemes .",
    "as a first example we consider a bell experiment on an entangled pair of spin-@xmath0 particles with bounded rfs . we will determine the minimal size for the spin rfs such that the outcomes can still violate bell s inequalities .",
    "we consider the chsh inequality  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the correlation function for the measurement @xmath27 at one laboratory and @xmath31 at the other laboratory . in quantum mechanics , for a given state @xmath32 of the pair , if the first spin is measured along direction @xmath27 and the second along @xmath31 , the correlation function reads @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to the standard bell experiment in which two distant observers possess unbounded rfs , we assume that they can only use their coherent states ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) with respect to which entangled spins can be measured .",
    "how large must @xmath36 and @xmath37 be , such that the chsh inequality is still violated ?",
    "we assume that the pair is in the singlet state @xmath38 .",
    "the two observers can choose between two measurement settings each , the setting being defined by the direction towards which the rf coherent state is pointing . as @xmath39 is a rotationally invariant state , the only relevant parameter in the correlation function is the relative angle between the two pointers .",
    "it is more mathematically convenient ( but operationally equivalent ) to write the state with fixed measurement settings and then to apply a rotation of an angle @xmath40 to one of the particles .",
    "the corresponding rotated singlet state is @xmath41 $ ] . if one measures total spin of the joint system of particle and rf at the two laboratories , the probabilities of the various outcomes are    @xmath42    where @xmath43 .",
    "( i.e. @xmath44 is the probability of finding the two particles aligned along @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , @xmath45 is the probability of finding both anti - aligned , etc ) . to calculate these one needs the coefficients @xmath46 inserting the probabilities in the definition of the correlation function @xmath47 one obtains @xmath48    in the limit of large @xmath36 and @xmath37 , eq .   becomes the familiar expression @xmath49 for the singlet correlation function with unbounded rfs .",
    "note that , differently from the case with classical rfs , we have in an offset term before @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the measurement settings which maximize are for the relative angle @xmath52 in all cases except between @xmath23 and @xmath53 , for which the angle is @xmath54 .",
    "the rf - dependent chsh expression then reads @xmath55 it exceeds the local realistic limit of 2 if @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , for equal rfs , one thus needs at least @xmath57 .",
    "we explore violation of multi - particle bell s inequalities with bounded rfs .",
    "consider @xmath58 spin-@xmath0 particles ( systems @xmath59 ) , that are measured along directions @xmath60 .",
    "each individual measurement can give @xmath61 as result ; a specific outcome is thus labeled by a string @xmath62 , where @xmath63 stands for the @xmath64-th spin detected aligned with @xmath65 , while @xmath66 represents the spin anti - aligned with @xmath65 .",
    "the multiparticle correlation function is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability for the outcomes @xmath69 given the settings @xmath60 .",
    "the mermin inequality is given by @xcite @xmath70            e({\\vec{\\alpha}}_{x_1 } , \\dots\\ , , { \\vec{\\alpha}}_{x_n } ) \\big| \\leq 2^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}.\\ ] ] using unbounded rfs the mermin expression reaches its maximal value of @xmath71 for the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath72 and measurement settings @xmath73 and @xmath74 for every particle .",
    "note that the ratio between maximal quantum and local realistic bound increases exponentially with the number of particles : @xmath75 .",
    "again , we assume now that the @xmath64-th observer , @xmath76 , is given a bounded rf in form of the coherent state @xmath77 .",

    "is measured and the outcome is interpreted as the projection of the particle s spin along the rf s direction . after a somewhat lengthy but straightforward calculation one obtains the correlation function observed to be : @xmath83 \\right .",

    "@xmath85 for @xmath86 , this approaches the value @xmath87 when unbounded rfs are used . in the limit of large number of particles , the mermin expression becomes @xmath88 if all the rfs are of the same size , @xmath89 @xmath90 , the minimal size of rfs that leads to violation is @xmath91 .",
    "one can use , however , even fewer resources if one allows spins of different lengths for rfs .",
    "if one takes @xmath92 spins of size @xmath36 and @xmath93 of size @xmath37 , expression ( [ largemermin ] ) becomes @xmath94 . in this case",
    "the mermin inequality is violated if @xmath95 as both factors are positive , can hold only if at least one of the two is larger than 1 , which is equivalent to @xmath96 .",
    "this implies that some of the rfs must have spin size equal to or larger than @xmath97 .",
    "if the parties have @xmath92 spin-@xmath97 rfs and @xmath98 spin-@xmath21 rfs , the minimal ratio is @xmath99 for seeing violation .",
    "therefore the minimal resources needed is 85% of spin-@xmath97 and 15% of spin-@xmath21 reference frames .",
    "another interesting case is when a fraction of the rfs is unbounded , which is equivalent to taking the limit @xmath100 in the inequality  . for @xmath92 rfs of size @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath93 unbounded rfs , it becomes @xmath101 . for @xmath102 ,",
    "this is satisfied when @xmath103 , which means that when half of the rfs are unbounded and half are as small as spin-@xmath21 , violation of the mermin inequality is still possible .",
    "note that in all cases considered  even when using small quantum rfs  the ratio between the quantum and local realistic bound is still exponential , as can be easily seen by inserting the results found into the expression  .",
    "however , if a single measurement is replaced with a random guess ( corresponding mathematically to @xmath104 ) , the inequality is satisfied .",
    "thus a non - trivial rf is required for every observer in order to see nonclassicality .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that violation of bell s inequalities with entangled systems of arbitrarily large dimension is possible .",
    "this shows that the view that large quantum numbers are associated with the classical limit is , in general , erroneous .",
    "we will show that to observe violations of local realism for large spins it is necessary to use the rfs of size sufficiently large compared to the size of the spins .",
    "the scaling of the two sizes is the issue we are interested in .        with @xmath108 the projectors onto subspaces of the spin component along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the parity measurement takes the value @xmath109 for all even @xmath15 , and @xmath110 for all odd @xmath15 .",
    "when the parity operator is defined with respect to spin projection along some other direction @xmath111 , we will speak about parity measurement @xmath112 along this direction . for alice s measurement along the direction",
    "@xmath111 and bob s along @xmath113 , the correlation function is defined as @xmath114 .",
    "the chsh inequality   is violated for parity measurements in the singlet state for arbitrarily large spins  @xcite .    to consider violation of the inequality with bounded rfs we introduce a coherent state of length @xmath115 for each observer , and replace the projectors @xmath116 in with the povm from eq .  .",
    "when the measurement setting @xmath117 is chosen , the coherent state @xmath118 aligned in that direction is used . in the basis of the spin projection along @xmath2-axis , it reads @xmath119 the rotated povm is given by @xmath120 and the corresponding parity operator by @xmath121 . finally , the rf dependent correlation function reads @xmath122 .",
    "we consider the situation where all the measurement angles are chosen in the same plane ( @xmath123 ) , with the first observer choosing between settings @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the second between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "taking @xmath128 , the chsh inequality reads @xmath129 . for classical reference frames ,",
    "the angle difference which maximizes @xmath130 in the limit of large spin @xmath105 is for @xmath131 , with @xmath132 .",
    "note that the angle difference is inversely proportional to the spin size . in the case of bounded rfs of finite size",
    "@xmath115 it is hard to compute the correlation function analytically , primarily due to the presence of a large number of non - trivial clebsch - gordan coefficients . as such we evaluate it , and the chsh expression , numerically and illustrate the results in fig .",
    "we see that one needs the size of the rfs to scale at least quadratically with the size of entangled spins to observe violation .",
    "needed for violation of the bell inequality for measurements on a pair of entangled spins of size @xmath105 .",
    "the dots are calculated numerically , the line is the extrapolated fit @xmath133 ( see text).,width=302 ]    we now give a heuristic argument to support our numerical findings . consider a coherent state of length @xmath115 pointing in a direction @xmath134 and a measurement of spin projection along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the probability to obtain outcome @xmath15 for the spin @xmath2 component obeys a binomial distribution @xmath135 , where @xmath136 . for large @xmath115",
    "this is approximately a gaussian centered in @xmath137 and with variance @xmath138 .",
    "it can be visualized as an arrow pointing toward @xmath40 with an angle uncertainty @xmath139 . using this as a rf it is impossible to distinguish between directions at angles closer than this amount .",
    "on the other hand , violation of bell s inequalities requires us to measure setting directions at angles that differ at the order of @xmath140 . to achieve this precision one needs @xmath141 , which gives the heuristic bound @xmath142 . fitting our numerical results with a quadratic law we indeed find the formula @xmath133 ( fig .",
    "( for higher order fits we obtain coefficients close to zero for the powers higher than two ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown how a bounded rf limits the ability of entangled systems to exhibit genuine quantum features , as characterized by violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "this can be relevant in situations where , to implement quantum information tasks , only relational degrees of freedom can be exploited ( for example , when the quantum channel is subject to a global noise ) .",
    "we focused on the restrictions derived from the lack of a directional rf , considering other restrictions would impose additional requirements on the resources needed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "quantum behavior is generally not observed in macroscopic systems .",
    "one reason is that an extremely high experimental resolution would be required to observe quantum phenomena , larger than what can be practically reached [ 7 ] .",
    "the quantum nature of any physical ( i.e. finite ) reference frame employed in an experiment gives a fundamental limitation on the maximally achievable resolution .",
    "our results set a lower bound on the resources ( i.e. the strength of quantum reference frames ) needed to obtain the resolution that is necessary for observation of quantum features of a system with a given size .",
    "for example , a small iron magnet can have a magnetic field of around 100 @xmath143 .",
    "suppose that an entangled state of a pair of spins each with size @xmath144 ( @xmath145 is the bohr magneton ) were available and could be sufficiently protected from decoherence .",
    "even in this case , according to our analysis , no violation of local realism is possible unless the rfs correspond to magnetic fields at least of order @xmath146 @xmath143 .",
    "this is much larger than what can be generally found in nature ( but still not impossible to produce ) .",
    "typically , quantum coherence in a system is quickly lost due to its interaction with the environment , but the coherence is preserved in correlations between the system and the environment @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of why we observe classicality of the macroscopic world rather than these quantum correlations is that they have no operational meaning unless a sufficiently strong rf is available ( cf , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but in everyday experience such rfs are not available for systems of the size of the environment .",
    "our analysis suggests that , for directional rfs , at least a quadratic scaling with the size of the system would be required to demonstrate the existence of the quantum correlations .",

    "information about the alignment of the beams containing the particles with respect to the lab would need to be available .",
    "however , typically this information about beam alignment does not contain any information about the particle spins - i.e. the internal degrees of freedom of the two particles .",
