    "the plasma in x - ray emitting clusters of galaxies is composed by hydrogen ( h ) , helium ( he ) and various ionized metals of which iron ( fe ) is the most interesting from the astrophysical point of view owing to its connection to the star formation activity ( e.g. renzini 2003 ) . in an x - ray",
    "emitting plasma with solar abundance , for each atom of hydrogen a number density of @xmath1 ions of he and @xmath2 ions of fe is expected ( as in anders & grevesse 1989 ; for the most recent determinations in grevesse & sauval 1998 and asplund , grevesse & sauval 2005 , @xmath3 ions of he correspond to each atom of h , whereas the number density of fe is @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) .",
    "being the atomic weight @xmath6 of ( h , he , fe ) @xmath7 , the mass fraction on the total is @xmath8 for the hydrogen ( generally labeled as @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 for helium ( called @xmath11 ) and the rest ( @xmath12 ) for heavier elements .",
    "diffusion of helium and other metals can occur in the core regions of the intracluster plasma under the attractive action of the central gravitational potential , enhancing their abundances on time scales comparable to the cluster age .",
    "qin & wu ( 2000 ) and chuzhoy & nusser ( 2003 ) , following the work by fabian & pringle ( 1977 ) , rephaeli ( 1978 ) , abramopoulos et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , gilfanov & syunyaev ( 1984 ) on the sedimentation of elements in clusters , studied the concentration of helium in cores concluding that it can gravitationally settle within a hubble time .",
    "abramopoulos et al . (",
    "1981 ) obtained the same results of qin & wu assuming a global thermal equilibrium and the boltzmann equation , while gilfanov & syunyaev ( 1984 ) applied the diffusion equation to the light elements ( atomic number @xmath13 ) where the changes are more efficient .",
    "therefore , in a h - he plasma , the helium tends to be more centrally peaked than the hydrogen .",
    "more recently , chuzhoy & loeb ( 2004 ) solved the full diffusion equations derived by burgers ( 1969 ) for a multicomponent fluid , finding that the diffusion , if the suppression due to magnetic fields is modest , can alter x - ray properties as the steepening inward of the baryon distribution as well as the spectrum and evolution of stars forming out from helium - rich gas .",
    "however , all these studies assume a gas temperature constant in time and space in evaluating the gravitational acceleration in the cluster core , where instead steep spatial gradients are observed in cool core clusters .    in the present work , we analyze the effects of sedimented elements , he in particular , on the description of the x - ray emitting plasma that is generally assumed with a fixed solar abundance of helium ( as tabulated in , e.g. , anders & grevesse 1989 ; on more recent estimates of the solar chemical composition see , for example , asplund , grevesse & sauval 2005 ) and a relative contribution from metals determined through the equivalent width of the detected emission lines in x - ray spectra .",
    "we model properly the central steepening of the observed gas temperature and density profiles to estimate the gravitation potential in the inner cluster regions where the effect of the gravitational sedimentation is expected to be more relevant . in these regions , we prove that the underestimation of the amount of helium can propagate to inaccurate measurements of the total x - ray emissivity , gas density and metallicity .",
    "spitzer ( 1956 ) presents the physics of fully ionized gases that we adopt in the following discussion . in general ,",
    "the time of equipartition between h and he ( fe ) ions is low when it is compared to the cluster age , whereas the sedimentation time is comparable to it . hereafter , we assume a cosmology @xmath14 that implies an age of the universe of @xmath15 years .",
    "to describe the action of the gravitational acceleration in drifting inward the plasma elements , we consider an intracluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , hereafter nfw ) potential @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "we are interested to measure such potential in the inner regions of a cluster , where a steep gradient in temperature is generally observed .",
    "a model for the gas density profile obtained analytically from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( hee ) with a nfw potential is available in literature ( e.g. makino , sasaki & suto 1998 , ettori & fabian 1999 ) , but it assumes an isothermal gas .",
    "we relax this assumption to accommodate the observed gradients and modify accordingly the model of the gas density profile .",
    "we assume a temperature profile with the functional form @xmath18 that is just the rearranged expression of the equation that allen , schmidt & fabian ( 2001 ) show to be able to reproduce the temperature profiles of relaxed clusters ( see vikhlinin et al .",
    "we use then this model in the hee with a nfw potential to recover a numerical expression of the gas density profile : @xmath19 with @xmath20 .    these functional forms of the temperature and density profiles",
    "are then joint - fitted with a @xmath21 minimization to the deprojected data of centaurus ( sanders et al . 2002 ) , a2199 ( johnstone et al . 2002 ) and a1795 ( ettori et al . 2002 ) . the best - fit results are presented in table  1 and plotted in fig.[fig : nt ] .",
    "a proper fit of the gas density and temperature gradient allows us to define accurately the cluster gravitational acceleration @xmath22 by using the nfw potential in equation  [ eq : nfw ] , @xmath23 with the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obtained as best - fit results of the deprojected gas density and temperature profiles . by using , instead",
    ", the best - fit parameters from an isothermal nfw gas density profile , as generally done for this kind of analysis , one would infer a potential in the inner regions that is larger than the adopted value by a factor of @xmath27 , mainly owing to the assumed higher temperature value that propagates linearly to the gravitational acceleration .",
    "for a boltzmann distribution of particles labeled @xmath28 with density @xmath29 and thermal velocity @xmath30 in a plasma with temperature @xmath31 in hydrostatic equilibrium with a nfw potential @xmath32 , the drift velocity of the heavier ions @xmath33 with respect to @xmath28 is given by ( e.g. spitzer 1956 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coulomb logarithm equals to @xmath36 .",
    "typical velocities of about @xmath33 kpc gyr@xmath37 are expected which can make reasonable the sedimentation of helium in the inner 10 kpc or so .",
    "the time elapsed in drifting from @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the sedimentation time , @xmath40 , that is therefore proportional to @xmath41 .",

    "+    the time required to sediment helium in the inner cluster regions is in the order of few giga - years ( see also chuzhoy & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "owing to the competing drag forces from the protons moving upwards and the helium diffusing inwards , heavier elements can sediment with similar velocity , as discussed in chuzoy & nasser ( 2003 ) .",
    "we conclude that sedimentation of helium is not an efficient process , given the present condition of the cluster plasma .",
    "however , the intracluster medium evolved to a well - defined cool core during its formation history .",
    "we can assume that the gas started originally with a flat temperature distribution equal to the value measured in the outskirts and a gas density profile obtained from the equation  [ eq : ngas ] by fixing @xmath50 and by requiring that the outer pressure remains unchanged as the overall gravitational potential .",
    "while the evolution of a cool core from an initially isothermal plasma is the natural consequence of the radiative processes taking place in the central regions at higher density , there is not yet detailed studies from , e.g. , cosmological simulations of structure formation that discuss the evolution of cool cores owing to the still unknown balance of energetic losses and feedbacks that rules the x - ray emitting plasma in the cluster cores ( for example , the temperature profiles are expected to be flatter and density higher at @xmath51 with respect to the local measurements in ettori et al .",
    "2004 , but burns et al .",
    "2004 suggest an alternative scenario in which cool cores in massive clusters are formed through the merging of subclumps with its own cool core ) .",
    "these assumptions imply that the gas temperature increases in the inner regions by a factor of @xmath52 and the density decreases in the center by about an order of magnitude . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tv_sed ] , these changes in gas temperature and density values cause the sedimentation time to be shorter .",
    "this makes reasonable the scenario in which ( i ) the helium sedimented during the initial collapse and subsequent relaxation of the cluster plasma and ( ii ) it resides nowadays in super - solar abundance in cluster cores .",
    "intracluster plasma emits mainly by x - rays through bremsstrahlung with a typical emissivity , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the cooling function of a plasma with temperature @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the electric charge ( f.e . 1 for h , 2 for he , 24 for fe ) , @xmath57 is the element abundance relative to the solar value and @xmath58 is the density of the species in exam .",
    "it is thus evident that any metal enhancement of its relative abundance with respect to the hydrogen , as occurs when sedimentation is relevant , affect the total x - ray emission .",
    "it is important to note that the x - ray emissivity is generally measured under the assumption that the helium abundance is fixed to the solar value relatively to hydrogen , i.e. @xmath59 . in the extreme case of a plasma composed by pure helium ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with the direct implication that if this plasma is assumed with solar abundance , the total density is overestimated by a factor of 2 .",
    "moreover , the change in the relative abundance of h and he induces variation in the number of electrons and ions present in the plasma @xmath63 where @xmath57 is the element metallicity and @xmath64 is the particle number density according to anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , and affects the measurements of the mean molecular weight , @xmath65 that is generally fixed to a value of @xmath66 appropriate for solar abundance . while @xmath67 and @xmath68 are quite independent of the metal component of the plasma ( e.g. @xmath69 and @xmath70 for a solar abundance , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for a metallicity of @xmath73 for the reference values in anders and grevesse ; note that , on the basis of the compilation in grevesse & sauval , @xmath74 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 , for a solar and @xmath78 times solar abundance , respectively ) , their values are highly sensitive to the variation in the helium abundance : for @xmath79 of , e.g. , 2 and 10 , @xmath80 and @xmath28 , respectively , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    through these quantities ,",
    "several other cluster measured properties are affected , like , e.g. , the cooling time @xmath83 , the gas mass density @xmath84 , the total gravitational mass measured through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , @xmath85 , the gas mass fraction , @xmath86 .",
    "the gas fraction , in particular , increases by a factor from 1.4 to 4.8 for 2 and 10 times the solar abundance of helium , respectively . to quantify the effect of sedimented helium on , e.g. , the cooling time we have first used the model vmekal in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) to estimate the cooling function @xmath87 for a range of gas temperatures , @xmath88 , and he abundances , @xmath79 , in the interval 1 and 10 with respect to the solar chemical compilation in anders & grevesse ( 1989",
    "; see command abund in xspec : @xmath89 ) .",
    "as expected , higher helium abundance induces larger emission and shorter cooling time of the emitting plasma , with a cooling function that raises for , e.g. , a gas at 2 kev and proton density of 0.2 @xmath45 by a factor of 1.2 ( @xmath90 ) and 2.6 ( @xmath91 ) and a cooling time that decreases from @xmath92 years to @xmath93 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath91 ) years . under the assumption that bremsstrahlung dominates ,",
    "@xmath95 which makes evident how the formation of a cool core , with the central gas that becomes progressively higher in density and lower in temperature , reduces significantly any process of sedimentation",
    ".    finally , we have simulated typical thermal spectra of long - time exposed cluster cores with the acis - s configuration on the _ chandra _ x - ray satellite generally adopted to fully exploit the larger collecting area at low energies with respect to acis - i .",
    "we have used the vmekal model in xspec to fake spectra with helium abundance in the range 110 times the solar abundance as in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "then , we have fitted to the simulated data both mekal and vmekal models with fixed solar abundance of helium , leaving only the normalization , the temperature and the metal ( one single parameter in mekal , 9 parameters o , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni in vmekal ) abundance free to vary .",
    "our results , shown in fig .  [ fig : xspec ] , indicate how an unrecognized super - solar abundance of helium causes underestimates of the metal ( iron ) abundance and overestimates of the model normalization owing to the induced increase of the total bremsstrahlung emissivity ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : em ] ) .",
    "we do not measure any relevant variation in the gas temperature and do not find any significant dependence of these trends upon the assumed values of column density , normalization and temperature",
    ". an important implication of these results is that it can potentially explain the drops in metallicity observed through x - ray spectra extracted from the inner ( @xmath96 kpc ) regions of several nearby bright galaxy clusters ( e.g. centaurus , sanders et al . 2002 ; a2199 , johnstone et al .",
    "2002 ; a3581 , johnstone et al .",
    "2005 ; a2204 , sanders et al . 2005 ; note that also a1795 shows a flat , marginally decreasing metal abundance in the inner two bins as shown in ettori et al .",
    "2002 ; see few examples of this inverted gradient in fig .",
    "[ fig : abun ] ) . figure  [ fig : xspec ] shows that an enhancement of a factor of few ( @xmath97 ) in the helium abundance with respect to the assumed solar value in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) is sufficient to explain the observed reduction of 2050 per cent in the metallicity measurements .",
    "we have studied the effects of the sedimentation of helium nuclei on the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters . to this purpose , we have estimated the gravitational acceleration by adopting functional forms for gas density and temperature profiles that have been obtained under the assumption that the plasma is in the hydrostatic equilibrium with a nfw potential .",
    "these functional forms are fitted to the observed deprojected gas density and temperature profiles and the best - fit results are used to model properly in the inner cluster regions the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the observed gas density and temperature values do not allow the metal to settle down in cluster cores over timescales shorter than few @xmath98 years .",
    "on the other hand , by assuming that in the same potential the gas that is now describing a cool core was initially isothermal , the sedimentation times are reduced by 12 order of magnitude within @xmath99 .",
    "the sedimentation of helium can then take place in cluster cores .",
    "even modest enhancement in the helium abundance affects ( i ) the relative number of electron and ions @xmath100 , ( ii ) the atomic mean molecular weight @xmath68 and all the x - ray quantities that depend on these values , such as the emissivity @xmath101 , the gas mass density @xmath102 , the total gravitating mass , @xmath85 , the gas mass fraction , @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we show that if we model a super - solar abundance of helium with the solar value , we underestimate the metal ( iron ) abundance and overestimate the model normalization or emission measure .",
    "for example , with @xmath104 , the measured iron abundance and emission measure are @xmath105 and @xmath106 times the input values , respectively .",
    "therefore , increased helium abundance might explain the drops in metallicity observed in the core of some nearby systems .",
    "other implications of the suspected and plausible super - solar abundance of helium in the cluster cores are : ( i ) the helium - rich gas will then cool out and form helium - rich stars that have a typical lifetime shorter and burn hotter than sun - like objects by an order of magnitude ( chris tout , priv . comm",
    ". ) ; ( ii ) the central elliptical galaxies of cool core clusters might be then overabundant in helium ( see speculation on this expected characteristic in lynden - bell 1967 ) , ( iii ) the central infall of helium induces heating of the surrounding plasma by @xmath107 that can offset the central cooling of about @xmath108 by a negligible amount .",
    "on the other hand , the diffusion of helium can be suppressed by the action of confinement due to reasonable magnetic fields , as recently pointed out from chuzhoy & loeb ( 2004 ) , or limited to the very central region ( @xmath109 kpc ) by the turbulent motion of the plasma .",
