    "the rapidly developing investigations in the area of nanometer - scale systems and its concomitant potential technological applications in real devices have induced considerable interest in the study of electrical transport through small molecules and quantum dots .",
    "in fact , the construction of molecular electronic devices @xcite is among the most exciting areas of investigations in physics , and theoretical guidance is needed for the success of this vast effort .",
    "molecules can change their shape and position relative to the leads as electrons enter or leave the molecule , making the study of these systems very challenging .",
    "moreover , coulomb correlations can not be neglected in small devices . for a conceptual understanding of these complex systems ,",
    "it is imperative to develop models and unbiased many - body methods that rely on a minimal number of assumptions , in order to accurately handle both strong coulombic and electron - phonon couplings .",
    "quantum dots constructed using conventional semiconductor technology also provide an important playground for the analysis of transport properties in nanoscopic systems , and the theoretical challenges in this context are equally important @xcite .",
    "the conductance of small nanoscopic systems can be theoretically estimated using a variety of techniques . among the most popular approaches",
    "are the ab - initio calculations using density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "these one - electron self - consistent methods have been successful in describing various i - v characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , the applicability of these ideas must be carefully scrutinized , as recently remarked by muralidharan _",
    "for example , it is clear that in small molecules charging effects are important , and they effectively act as quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "moreover , techniques that do not take into account the strong correlation between electrons can not capture important effects such as the kondo resonance ( arising from the coupling between localized spins and conduction electrons ) which induces a new channel for transport in a variety of small systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that several bulk materials , such as transition metal oxides , can not be described with ab - initio methods that neglect correlations .",
    "the complexity of their behavior , including potentially useful effects such as large magnetoresistances in mn oxides @xcite , may manifest in nanoscopic systems as well , and the use of strongly correlated materials in nanodevices may lead to interesting applications . to study all these systems ( small molecules , quantum dots , and in general nanodevices that include strongly correlated materials ) , techniques beyond dft must be developed .",
    "a similar challenge occurred before in the study of bulk materials and several years of research have shown that the following two - steps process leads to profound insights .",
    "the first step consists of a simple modeling of the material , typically either deducing the relevant degrees of freedom from atomistic considerations when the states are very localized , or borrowing from band structure calculations to isolate the minimal ingredients needed to capture the essence of the problem .",
    "the second step , the hardest , is solving the resulting model , which is typically of a tight - binding nature with the addition of coulombic and phononic couplings . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the use of numerical techniques provides the most reliable unbiased approach for the approximate investigation of tight - binding - like models with coulombic interactions @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a natural path toward the study of transport in strongly correlated nanoscopic systems can also start with simple models and use computational techniques for their analysis .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to propose a technique that can be used to study transport in systems described by strongly correlated electronic models .",
    "the method to calculate conductances proposed here relies on the successful density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique @xcite . while in principle",
    "this method is applicable only to quasi - one - dimensional models , such a geometry is quite acceptable in several nanoscopic important problems including transport in arrays of quantum dots or using small molecules as bridges between leads .",
    "however , a straightforward application of the original dmrg methodology is not immediately useful to study transport , particularly when arbitrarily large external electric and magnetic fields , with potentially complicated time dependences , are switched on and off at particular times .",
    "nevertheless , progress toward a computational tool for these type of problems has been steady in recent years .",
    "for instance , important numerical methods for dynamical dmrg studies were presented to handle frequency dependent spectral functions @xcite .",
    "more directly focusing on real - time investigations , interesting techniques were proposed @xcite . while useful for many qualitative applications , these methods are in general not as accurate and stable as needed for the detailed study of finite bias transport in complicated nanosystems .",
    "the reason is that the method of ref .",
    "is `` static '' in the sense that the truncated hilbert space found to be optimal at time @xmath0=0 , namely before switching on the external fields , is kept at all times .",
    "this approach breaks down after relatively short times , since extra states are needed for a proper description of transport at finite times .",
    "a further approximation to improve on this first proposal is to enlarge substantially the initial hilbert space so that it remains suitable for properties calculated at finite times @xcite .",
    "this technique has the problem that the number of states grows rapidly with the simulation time and eventually it becomes impractical .",
    "nevertheless , the method has been successfully used to study the propagation of a density excitation in an interacting clean system @xcite .",
    "recently , important developments have led to the `` adaptive '' time - dependent version of the dmrg method , that is efficient over long times and , thus , it is suitable to handle the problems we are focusing on ( for a detailed review see ref . ) . the method to be used here",
    "was developed independently by white and feiguin @xcite and daley _",
    "@xcite , after the idea of how to do time - evolution to a matrix product was introduced by vidal @xcite , and relies on an adaptive optimal hilbert space that follows the state as time grows .",
    "the method is based on a suzuki - trotter break - up of the evolution operator , and as a consequence a trotter truncation error is introduced .",
    "fortunately , this systematic error can be easily estimated and controlled .",
    "the adaptive dmrg numerical method will only be briefly reviewed below since our proposal uses the technique to calculate conductances , but does not modify the method itself .",
    "the reader should consult the original literature @xcite for more details .",
    "it is important to remark that the technique is easy to implement once a ground - state dmrg code is prepared and , moreover , the time - evolution is stable , as shown explicitly in our results and in some previous investigations ( further improvements can be added with the time - step targeting method recently proposed by feiguin and white @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion of our effort documented below is that the adaptive method provides accurate results for the calculation of conductances .",
    "the technique has passed the test of noninteracting electrons , as well as the cases of one and two interacting quantum dots , where a subtle kondo effect occurs .",
    "moreover , the method is not restricted to small biases but it produces reasonable answers at finite bias as well . as a consequence , it has the potential of being the method of choice to study transport under both weak and strong external fields , in small nanostructures of substantial complexity .",
    "multilevel model hamiltonians , possibly inspired by ab - initio calculations , can be used to describe the `` bridge '' between leads .",
    "in addition , the method is particularly transparent since it relies on the straightforward calculation of a current in the presence of a voltage , rather than relying on other indirect linear - response formulas .",
    "of course , the reader must be aware that the method is not of unlimited applicability .",
    "if the molecules or kondo clouds are too long in size , eventually not even dmrg can handle the very long chains needed for a proper description . for completeness , and to assure a balanced description of the technique , one of these difficult cases is also presented in our manuscript .",
    "but often the qualitative physics can be understood by relaxing parameters , thus we expect that even in very complicated cases the propose technique will be helpful , at least at the conceptual level",
    ". other limitations of the present technique is that energy dissipation is not incorporated , and the temperature is restricted to be zero .",
    "improving on these issues is a task left for the near future .",
    "it is important to remark that there are other numerical techniques that can also be used to study transport in strongly correlated nano - systems .",
    "one of them is the numerical renormalization group , that evolved from wilson s original rg ideas .",
    "this technique is quite accurate , as exemplified by some recent calculations @xcite , but it can not be used for arbitrary problems . since",
    "our goal is to try to develop a method that can handle the fairly complex models that will be used in the near future to represent , e.g. , small molecular conductors , this method does not have sufficient flexibility for our purposes . in cases where nrg works",
    ", it should be the method of choice , but this occurs in a small subset of problems in the area of transport across correlated systems .",
    "a second approach relies on the static dmrg method , using a ring geometry and with a current induced by a flux threading the ring @xcite .",
    "a recently proposed third method combines linear response kubo theory with static dmrg and the conductance is calculated based on correlation functions in the ground state @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to find out if the methods of refs .",
    "can reach a similar accuracy as ours for the case of the one and two quantum dots .",
    "a fourth method is the exact diagonalization technique followed by a dyson equation embedding procedure ( ed+de ) @xcite where the interacting region is solved exactly ( including some sites of the leads ) , and then the rest of the leads are taken into account via a dyson self - consistent approach .",
    "the method directly treats bulk systems , contrary to the dmrg technique that is necessarily limited to a large but finite chain , it is flexible and has led to interesting results for difficult cases , such as center - of - mass phonons in molecular conductors , and multilevel systems @xcite .",
    "however , the dyson embedding is somewhat arbitrary and it is difficult to control its accuracy .",
    "it is our intention in the near future to combine the ed+de method with the dmrg approach discussed in this paper , and for the physical problems where these independent techniques give similar results , then the case can be made that a reliable conclusion has been reached .",
    "thus , ed+de and the present method are complementary .",
    "the organization of the manuscript is as follows .",
    "after the present introduction , in section ii , the models are defined and the technique is very briefly described .",
    "section iii contains the important test of noninteracting electrons ( note that although the coulombic coupling is zero , there are different hopping amplitudes at different links ) . here",
    ", the systematic behavior of the method is discussed in detail .",
    "section iv deals with the case of a quantum dot , with a nonzero hubbard coupling .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is comparable to the hoppings , to prevent the kondo cloud from reaching huge sizes that would render the dmrg method useless ( nevertheless , one `` large '' @xmath1 case is studied for completeness , to illustrate the limitations of the method ) .",
    "section v contains the case of two dots , which themselves can be coupled in a `` singlet '' preventing conduction or loosely coupled having individually a kondo effect .",
    "the conclusions in section vi briefly summarize our findings .",
    "in general , the systems studied here consist of a relatively small region where coulomb interactions are present , weakly coupled to two non - interacting leads ( see fig.[schematic ] ) .",
    "the interacting region can represent one or several quantum dots ( qd s ) , a single - molecule conductor , or other nanoscopic regions .",

    ", a brief description of the numerical technique is here provided for completeness .",
    "the basic idea is to incorporate the suzuki - trotter ( st ) decomposition of the time - evolution operator @xcite into the dmrg finite - system algorithm @xcite . the second order st decomposition of the 1d hamiltonian as employed in ref",

    "an operator @xmath44 acting on sites @xmath25 and @xmath45 ( namely , only involving nearest - neighbors ) can be applied to @xmath46 exactly , and re - expressed in the same optimal basis as @xmath47_{l\\alpha_j\\alpha_{j+1 } r } = \\sum_{\\alpha'_j\\alpha'_{j+1 } } a_{\\alpha_j\\alpha_{j+1};\\alpha'_j\\alpha'_{j+1 } } \\psi_{l\\alpha'_j\\alpha'_{j+1 } r}. \\label{operator}\\ ] ] thus , the time evolution operator of the link @xmath25 can be applied exactly on the dmrg step @xmath25 . as a consequence ,",
    "the time evolution is done by applying @xmath48 at dmrg step 1 , @xmath49 at dmrg step 2 , and so on , thus forming the usual left - to - right sweep .",
    "then , applying all the reverse terms in the right - to - left sweep .",
    "a full sweep evolves the system one time step @xmath50 .",
    "the error introduced by the second order decomposition is order @xmath51 in each time step @xcite .",
    "thus , upon evolving the system one time unit ( @xmath52 steps ) , an order @xmath53 error is introduced .",
    "numerically , the influence of this small systematic error is easy to control .",
    "this brief summary gives the reader a rough idea of the technique used here .",
    "details regarding lattice sizes , number of states kept in the dmrg procedure , and influence of other parameters are discussed below .",
    "properties of the method discussed in this paper are exemplified in fig.[exact.l](a ) , where the current at the center of the chain is shown ( divided by the voltage difference ) as a function of time .",
    "the current in this figure is _ exactly _ calculated , not using dmrg , since for non - interacting particles the problem reduces to a single electron problem .",
    "a small bias @xmath34=0.001 will be used , unless otherwise stated .",
    "thus , in this first study the focus will be on trying to reproduce results expected from linear response , but a few results with a finite bias are also included in the manuscript , as discussed below .",
    "returning to fig.[exact.l](a ) , for a bulk system the current would be expected to raise for a small fraction of time , and then reach a steady state .",
    "this indeed occurs even in our finite - size systems .",
    "in fact , the transition from zero current at @xmath0=0 to an approximately time - independent current regime is very fast , and can be barely observed in the scale of fig.[exact.l](a ) .",
    "but the existence of a very flat plateau in the current is clear , and its value will be used to extract the conductance below . note that due to the finite size of the system , the current can not continue in the same steady state at all times .",
    "the hamiltonian is particle number conserving and , as a consequence , the presence of a current implies a population / depopulation of the leads , which can not continue forever .",
    "in fact , once the front of the charge pulse reaches the end of the chain , it bounces back and eventually generates a current of the opposite sign .",
    "this effect will be discussed in more detail later . here",
    ", it is important to remark that in spite of this periodicity present in finite open - end systems , the flat plateaus are clearly defined over an extended period of time for the lattice of 402 sites used , and the value of the conductance can be easily deduced from those individual plateaus , as discussed below .",
    "note that the setup of fig.[schematic ] and the existence of plateaus in the current fig.[exact.l ] are natural in the dmrg / transport context and was observed before @xcite .",
    "our main contribution will be the use of the adaptive dmrg method for the calculations , as shown below .    to further illustrate the propagation of charge in the cluster after the finite bias",
    "is switched on at time @xmath0=0 , in fig.[g.x ] the exact current at different positions @xmath54 is shown , parametric with time . at small times , @xmath0=5 ( in units of @xmath55/@xmath0 ) only the central portion is affected as expected . at time @xmath0=55 , the affected region is much larger , while at @xmath0=105 , the front has reached the ends of the chain and soon after it starts bouncing back . at times",
    "@xmath0=200 and 205 , approximately the initial condition is recovered , and almost everywhere the current to the left and right cancel out nearly exactly . for larger times",
    ", a reverse sign current is created .",
    "note that in our studies there are @xmath56 sources of dissipation , and the current will keep on oscillating forever .",
    "adding inelastic processes is a next major challenge in this context , left for the future .",
    "it is also important to show that the existence of the plateaus is not restricted to very long chains of hundreds of sites , but they are visible on much smaller systems , increasing the chances that the numerical dmrg method can be used even for complicated nanosystems .",
    "figure [ exact.l](b ) contains the current vs. time for a variety of lattice sizes , ranging from 402 to systems as small as 16 sites .",
    "the time width of the plateaus depends on @xmath57 , as expected , but the value of the current at the plateaus is approximately @xmath57 independent even up to systems as small as containing @xmath57=32 sites .",
    "even the @xmath57=16 chain has a periodicity with a first plateau in the current which is also in good agreement with the expected value from larger sizes .",
    "thus , this behavior appears to be robust and the plateaus are also expected to be present for the chains that the dmrg method can handle . that this is the case",
    "can be shown in fig.[dmrg - exact.l ] , where dmrg results for the current vs. time are shown , compared with exact data .",
    "consider first a sufficiently long chain , as shown in ( a ) , such that a sharp plateau is observed in the exact result .",
    "figure [ dmrg - exact.l](a ) shows that increasing the number of states @xmath28 used in the dmrg approximation , a convergence to the exact solution is observed .",
    "in fact , for @xmath28=300 or higher , the dmrg results can not be distinguished from the exact ones .",
    "a similar behavior is found using shorter chains as for the case with @xmath57=64 sites fig.[dmrg - exact.l](b ) , but in this example the plateau can be observed accurately even with a smaller number of states such as @xmath28=200 .",
    "the trend continues for smaller systems ( c , d ) : for @xmath57=32 and 16 , the dmrg method reproduces the exact results with high accuracy using @xmath58100 states .",
    "figure [ exact.g - vg](a ) shows the conductance deduced from the behavior of the current obtained with the dmrg method , versus the gate voltage @xmath13 , for the case of a single `` noninteracting '' quantum dot , namely one having @xmath1=0 .",
    "the hopping amplitude between the dot and the leads is @xmath16=0.4 .",
    "it is expected that the maximum value of the conductance be obtained when the level in the dot is aligned with the fermi level of the leads , and this occurs in our case at @xmath13=0 .",
    "the dmrg results beautifully confirm this expectation . as the gate voltage changes away from 0 ,",
    "the conductance is expected to decrease symmetrically and this is indeed shown in fig.[exact.g - vg](a ) .",
    "in fact , the results at nonzero gate voltage are also in excellent quantitative agreement with the exact results .",
    "all the previous results were obtained for a sufficiently small value of the bias voltage @xmath59@xmath60=0.001 , as already explained .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the results change when larger values of @xmath59@xmath60 are employed .",
    "figure [ exact.g - vg](b ) shows the current for a couple of biases .",
    "the existence of the plateau is clear in both cases , but for @xmath59@xmath60=0.01 , asymmetries between positive and negative bias can be observed , which are not expected in the limit @xmath59@xmath60@xmath610 . as a consequence , the rest of the results discussed below were obtained with @xmath59@xmath60=0.001 , unless otherwise noted . an easy criterion to realize if a sufficiently small bias is used to obtain the linear response limit is to repeat the calculations for the same amplitude of bias , but opposite signs , and see if a noticeable difference is obtained .",
    "the method proposed here also works in the case of a finite bias voltage , namely it is not restricted to the linear response regime . to show that the technique can handle even a large bias , in fig.[dmrg - exact.dv ] results for the current vs. time are shown at the indicated voltages .",
    "it is only at @xmath59@xmath60 as large as 1.0 that small differences are visually observed in the figure , between the dmrg and exact results .",
    "this can be easily fixed increasing slightly the number of states @xmath28 .",
    "thus , overall the method appears to be sufficiently robust to handle arbitrary voltages , showing the generality of the technique here proposed .",
    "nevertheless , further work in the finite bias context will be important to fully test this case , calculating differential conductances and analyzing the regime of very strong bias .    in our investigations ,",
    "the numerical study was also carried out using a `` static '' procedure , where the @xmath0=0 dmrg basis is not expanded with growing time . in this case , the results are obtained by integrating the time - dependent schrdinger equation using the fourth order runge - kutta method , and also using the dmrg ground state as the initial state.@xcite this is to be contrasted with the procedure of refs . where the basis is modified with time .",
    "figure [ methods - comp ] shows the results of both procedures : clearly using an adaptive basis provides superior data , reproducing accurately the exact results . in the static procedure",
    "a similar accuracy is reached only by increasing substantially the number of states , thus missing its economical cpu - time advantages .",
    "the method discussed here also works nicely for the case of two non - interacting qd s , as shown in fig.[2qd.g - vg ] for two different values of the hopping amplitude @xmath23 between the dots . the slight difference between the dmrg and the bulk exact results",
    "can be improved increasing the number of sites .",
    "although not directly related with the method to obtain the conductance of an interacting nano - system discussed in this paper , for completeness we have also studied the local density - of - states which are important to guide the intuition and contrast with other methods and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments as well . in fig.[ldos ] , results for non - interacting quantum dots are shown ( namely , dots where the hubbard repulsion is 0 ) . clearly , both the exact results ( which are shown already in the bulk limit ) and the dmrg results , slightly smeared by shifting , using a small imaginary component @xmath62 , the pole locations in the continued fraction expansion , are in excellent agreement in both cases .",
    "a smaller @xmath62 would have revealed the many @xmath63-functions in the dmrg case obtained using a finite chain with 64 sites .",
    "in the previous sections , the method was introduced and tested for the case of noninteracting @xmath1=0 electrons .",
    "but the main application of the technique is envisioned to occur in the presence of nontrivial coulombic interactions ( and eventually also adding phononic degrees of freedom ) . in this section ,",
    "the case of a nonzero hubbard coupling will be considered , focusing on the special case of one quantum dot .",
    "the hamiltonian used was already discussed in previous sections .",
    "figure [ u.1.0.l ] contains our dmrg results for the current vs. time , for the case of @xmath1=1.0 .",
    "similar values of this coupling were extensively used in previous investigations @xcite , and it is believed to lead to a kondo cloud of a size amenable to numerical investigations ( note that if @xmath1 is very large , the effective @xmath64 between localized and mobile spins is reduced , and it is known that the cloud s size rapidly grows with decreasing @xmath64 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the systematic behavior found in the noninteracting case survives the presence of a coulomb interaction , namely the current develops plateaus that can be used to determine the conductance .",
    "for instance , this effect is clearly present for @xmath57=96 and 128 , although for smaller sizes ( shown for completeness ) the maximum current is 10% to 20% less than expected and one must be cautious with size effects .",
    "the value of the gate voltage is -@xmath1/2 , which in the absence of the kondo effect would locate the system in the conductance `` valley '' ( implying a near zero conductance ) between the coulomb blockade peaks at -@xmath1 and 0 .",
    "the figure shows that the method introduced in this paper is able to reproduce the existence of a kondo effect , since the conductance is actually very close to the ideal limit 2@xmath65/@xmath66 @xcite , rather than being negligible .",
    "this is a highly nontrivial test that the proposed technique has passed .",
    "= 6.5 cm    results for other values of the gate voltage are shown in fig.[average ] . moving away from @xmath13=-@xmath1/2 ,",
    "the current is reduced , as discussed below in more detail .",
    "note that the plateaus contain small oscillations as a function of time.@xcite the procedure followed here to extract the current needed for the calculation of the conductance is to carry out averages over time , as shown in the figure , once the plateau region is reached .",
    "the size of the oscillations give an indication of the errors in the numerical determination of the conductance , for a given lattice size . as @xmath57 and @xmath28 increases , the oscillations tend to disappear .",
    "= 6.5 cm    following the procedure sketched in fig.[average ] , the full conductance vs. @xmath13 was prepared for @xmath1 equal to 1 and 2 .",
    "the results are in fig.[g.n - vg ] .",
    "the shape of the curve is the expected one for the regime considered here : the intermediate values of @xmath1 do not locate our investigation deep in the kondo regime , with sharply defined integer charge at the dot , but more into the mixed - valence region .",
    "this can be deduced from the value of the dot charge vs. @xmath13 , also shown in fig.[g.n - vg ] . with increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "sharper charge steps are formed , but the kondo cloud size increases , as discussed later .",
    "there are cases where the technique gives results that are only qualitatively correct .",
    "while clearly further increases of the number of states and lattice sizes will improve the accuracy , it is important to judge if at least the essence of the physics has been captured by our proposed method . in fig.[g.n - vg.u.4.0 ] , results for @xmath1=4 are shown .",
    "this is a representative of the `` large '' @xmath1 regime , since it must be compared with @xmath16 ( as opposed to @xmath0=1 ) that is only 0.4 in this figure .",
    "another indication that this @xmath1 is large is in fig.[g.n - vg.u.4.0](b ) where a clear sharp quantization of the charge inside the dot is observed . in this large-@xmath1 regime",
    ", the dmrg conductance is shown in ( a ) .",
    "clearly , there is a substantial difference between the friedel sum - rule estimation ( which has the correct `` box '' shape in the gate voltage range -1 and 0 ) and the dmrg numbers .",
    "however , at least the fact that there must be a nonzero conductance at @xmath13=-@xmath1/2 was properly captured by the method .",
    "this example illustrates a case where size effects are important , due to the subtle rapid increase of the kondo cloud with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , the qualitative results were captured , in spite of the fact that to reach a quantitative conclusion much larger sizes must be considered . this case is shown as a cautionary example to the readers , that must be alert of the limitations of the numerical methods . note that while fsr results are excellent , for other arbitrary cases it would be unclear whether the friedel sum - rule method is valid and , as a consequence , not always this procedure can be used .      to carry out the investigations presented thus far in this and the previous section , the number of sites in the leads at left and right of the dot region",
    "have been chosen such that one lead has an @xmath67 number and the other an @xmath68 number of sites ( to refer to this case , the notation used below will be `` odd - qds - even '' ) . while this should be irrelevant for very long chains , in practice this is important for the speed of convergence of the conductance calculations with increasing cluster size .",
    "for example , in the interacting case @xmath1@xmath690 , a kondo or mixed - valence regime is expected where the spin at the dot couples with electrons at the fermi level of the leads .",
    "this formation of the kondo cloud occurs more efficiently on a finite - size lattice if already a zero energy level is available , as it occurs when one of the leads has an odd number of sites . that this improves the rate of convergence with increasing lattice size is shown in fig.[finitesize ] , where the odd-1qd - even case is contrasted to the even-1qd - even case , where in both leads the number of sites is even .",
    "clearly , the odd-1qd - even case approaches the ideal limit 2@xmath65/@xmath66 faster than using leads with an even number of sites , and it is recommended to be used in future investigations .",
    "the figure also shows that eventually with sufficiently large systems , both combinations will reach the same ideal result , as expected . the remaining possibility ( odd-1qd - odd )",
    "was also investigated ( not shown ) . for reasons that remain to be analyzed further , the convergence in this case is not as good as in the odd-1qd - even case . as a consequence ,",
    "empirically it is clear that the combination even - qds - odd is the most optimal to speed up the size convergence of the calculation .",
    "another method to improve the size convergence was tested .",
    "following ref .  , the finite - size effects can be reduced by using `` damped boundary conditions '' ( dbc ) .",
    "the hoppings in the @xmath70 links at the boundaries are reduced using the formulas @xmath71 , where @xmath72@xmath73@xmath74 .",
    "@xmath70 has to be chosen such that the damping occurs far enough from the central region .",
    "figure [ finitesize2 ] shows the finite size scaling using odd - qd - even clusters and the same parameters as in fig.[finitesize ] , both with dbc and the standard open boundary conditions ( obc ) used in the rest of the paper .",
    "the latter indeed improves the convergence . while in the present study",
    ", obc were used in most of the manuscript to keep the simplicity in the presentation and reduce the number of parameters , the use of dbc is recommended for cases where size effects are strong .      to fully confirm that our investigations in the kondo / mixed valence regime have captured the essence of the problem , namely the formation of a kondo cloud with antiferromagnetic coupling between the spins at the leads and the dot , investigations including magnetic fields are necessary . in fig.[g - vg.b ] , it is shown how the the kondo plateau in the conductance evolves with increasing magnetic field . as expected from previous investigations , including results obtained using very different techniques such as the lanczos method followed by a dyson - equation embedding procedure ( ed+de ) @xcite , the conductance broad peak splits with increasing magnetic field @xmath75 . at large @xmath75 ,",
    "two peaks are observed at -@xmath1 and 0 , as it occurs also in the high temperature regime where only coulomb blockade effects are present .",
    "the method discussed in this paper is general , and in principle it can be implemented for a variety of complicated geometries and couplings in the interactive region between the leads .",
    "thus , it is important to confirm that the method will keep its validity going beyond the one quantum dot case . in this section ,",
    "the case of two dots will be studied .",
    "systems with two quantum dots are believed to be understood theoretically and , as a consequence , our numerical data can be contrasted against robust results in the literature .",
    "cases involving more dots @xcite are still not fully understood , and their analysis will be postponed for future investigations . in fig.[2qd ] , the current vs. time is shown for two dots .",
    "the hamiltonian for this case was already defined in previous sections . for a fixed @xmath16 ,",
    "increasing the amplitude of the direct hopping between the dots @xmath23 amounts to isolating the two dots system from the rest . as a consequence ,",
    "the current is expected to decrease , and the method indeed reproduces this effect , as shown in the figure .",
    "the same physics is obtained reducing @xmath16 , at fixed @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , previous studies @xcite have shown that the conductance only depends on @xmath23/@xmath76 , and this has been verified using our method .",
    "the conductance of a system with two dots in series will decrease with increasing @xmath23/@xmath76 ( at large @xmath23/@xmath76 ) due to the decoupling of the two - dots system into a small two - sites molecule , as already discussed .",
    "but this conductance will also be very small at small @xmath23 when the tunneling from one dot to the next is nearly cutoff . as a consequence",
    ", the conductance vs. @xmath23/@xmath76 is known to present a peak at intermediate values . in fig.[g - tpp ] , the slave - boson mean - field technique ( sbmft ) predictions for this case obtained in previous investigations @xcite are shown together with our results .",
    "the agreement is fairly reasonable , providing further support that the method discussed here can handle systems where there are competing tendencies , beyond the one quantum - dot case .",
    "in this manuscript , a method was proposed and tested to calculate the conductance of small ( nanoscale ) strongly correlated systems modeled by tight - binding hamiltonians .",
    "the approach is based on the adaptive time - dependent dmrg method , and it was shown to work properly for non - interacting systems and also in the cases of one and two quantum dots . besides the finite size effects , discussed in the text as well , there are no other severe limitations to handle complex interacting models with arbitrary couplings .",
    "the method is a complement to dft calculations in the nanoscopic context .",
    "further improvements of the technique must consider temperature and inelastic effects .",
    "it is concluded that the semi - quantitative analysis of transport in models of strongly correlated nanosystems appears under reach , and much progress is expected from the application of the technique presented here to realistic hamiltonians for small molecules and arrays of quantum dots . the remarkable cross - fertilization between modeling , simulation , and experiments existing in bulk strongly correlated materials , such as transition - metal oxides , can be repeated in a variety of interesting systems at the nanoscale .",
