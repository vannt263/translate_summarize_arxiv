    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) coulomb plasma is the continuous system of charged particles , plus perhaps a uniformly charged neutralizing background , confined to a plane and interacting via the logarithmic coulomb potential . in this paper , the classical equilibrium statistical mechanics at the ( dimensionless ) inverse temperature @xmath3 is studied .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the simple point - particle coulomb systems : if there are at least two species of charged particles with opposite signs , the coulomb system is stable against the charge collapse for small enough @xmath7 ( in 3d , the collapse point @xmath8 and the stability requires quantum mechanics @xcite ) . going beyond the collapse point needs a short - distance ( e.g. hard core ) regularization of the coulomb interaction .",

    "the bulk thermodynamics , based on the scale invariance of the logarithmic potential , the density derivatives of the free energy , like the pressure , can be obtained exactly in the whole stability range of temperatures @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , the temperature derivatives of the free energy , like the internal energy or the specific heat , are nontrivial statistical quantities which can not be obtained by simple means and they are known only in special cases ( see below ) .",
    "the most studied versions of the coulomb plasma are the one - component plasma ( ocp ) and the symmetric two - component plasma ( tcp ) , or coulomb gas .",
    "the 2d ocp of equally , say unit , charged pointlike particles in a uniform neutralizing background is formally related to the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "no collapse occurs .",
    "there are indications that , around @xmath11 , the fluid system undergoes a phase transition to a 2d wigner crystal @xcite . in a more recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the existence of this transition has been put in doubt .",

    "the large - distance behavior of the bulk charge @xcite and density @xcite correlation functions was derived exactly by exploring the form - factor theory of the equivalent sine - gordon model .",

    "the exact solution involves the complete bulk thermodynamics ( the free energy , the internal energy , the specific heat ) and the large - distance behavior of the particle correlation functions .",
    "it is obtained by mapping the underlying coulomb gas onto a member of 2d toda field theories @xcite , namely the complex bullough - dodd ( cbd ) model @xcite-@xcite with a conformal normalization of the exponential field .",
    "recent results about that integrable field theory , derived by using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( thermodynamics ) and the form - factor method ( correlation functions ) , are applied .",
    "since the calculations in the cbd model are based on special analyticity assumptions , which are not yet rigorously proven , we check the results for the plasma by a small-@xmath3 expansion , using a renormalized mayer expansion in density @xcite , and close to the collapse @xmath4 point , using an electroneutrality sum rule @xcite combined with an independent - pair conjecture made by hauge and hemmer @xcite .",
