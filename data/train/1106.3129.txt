    "* ) is an important aspect of the activity in ebl studies .",
    "the mean free path of @xmath0-rays due to interactions with ebl strongly depends on energy .",
    "therefore the intergalactic absorption leads not only to attenuation of the absolute fluxes , but also to significant changes in the spectral shape of @xmath0-rays .",
    "the proper understanding of this spectral deformation is crucial for the correct interpretation of the vhe data from distant agn .",
    "it is important to note that because of strong doppler boosting of the non - thermal emission ( @xmath3 ) the @xmath0-ray emission from the brightest blazars can remain detectable even after severe intergalactic absorption .",
    "thus the mere attenuation of the @xmath0-ray emission is not enough to derive robust constraints on the ebl models .",
    "the distortion of the initial spectral shape of @xmath0-rays contains more information . since in the effective absorption regime the optical depth @xmath4 , even a slight change of the ebl intensity can lead to a strong change of the energy - dependent spectral deformation factor @xmath5 $ ]",
    "this allows quite meaningful upper limits on the ebl in the relevant energy bands , based on the condition that the intrinsic spectrum of @xmath0-rays should have a decent form , e.g. be not much harder than @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption - corrected vhe spectra of some agn with @xmath1 in some cases appear very hard , even for very a low ebl flux , with a power - law photon index @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) quite close to the hardest conventional value of @xmath9 @xcite . in the case of slightly higher fluxes of the ebl",
    ", the reconstructed spectra would get even harder , with @xmath10 .",
    "although currently there is a general consensus in the community that the ebl intensity should be quite close to the robust lower limits derived from galaxy counts , the possibility of slightly higher fluxes of the ebl can not yet be excluded . in particular , using spitzer data and a profile fitting of the faint fringes of galaxies , @xcite claimed a new fiducial value for the contribution of galaxies to the ebl at @xmath11 of @xmath12 , which exceeds by a factor of @xmath13 the flux of the ebl suggested by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite indicated that for this flux of ebl the initial ( absorption corrected ) vhe spectra of distant blazars 1es  0229 + 200 , 1es  1218 + 30.4 and 1es  1101 - 232 ( located at redshifts @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) would have a photon index @xmath17 .",
    "this result would challenge the conventional models for vhe production in agn .",
    "generally , the x- and @xmath0-ray non - thermal emission of blazars is interpreted as a sum of synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) components of radiation from relativistic electrons , in the framework of the so - called synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) or external compton ( ec ) scenarios . in the case of radiatively efficient models , i.e. assuming a _ radiatively cooled _ particle distribution , the ic spectrum in the thomson limit is expected to be steeper than the power - law distribution with photon index @xmath18 .",
    "this limit does not depend on the electron initial ( injection ) spectrum and can be achieved , for example , in the case of a mono - energetic injection . at higher energies ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum becomes steeper due to the klein - nishina effect .",
    "we note however , that typically the spectra obtained in the frameworks of ssc scenario are steeper , with photon indices @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum with photon index @xmath9 is often referred to as the hardest spectrum allowed by standard blazar models . however , in the expense of radiation efficiency it is possible to produce harder vhe spectra still within the ssc framework , for example assuming a high lower - energy cutoff in the electron spectrum @xcite .",
    "the postulation of such a cutoff in the electron spectrum implies very low efficiency of radiative cooling which , in turn , increases the requirements for the energy in accelerated electrons and at the same time requires very small magnetic fields .",
    "thus , in such scenarios we face a significant ( by orders of magnitude ) deviation from equipartition , @xmath20 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , @xcite have suggested a scenario for the formation of vhe spectra of almost _ arbitrary _ hardness by involving additional absorption of vhe @xmath0-rays interacting with dense radiation fields in the vicinity of the @xmath0-ray production region .",
    "the key element in this scenario is the presence of a dense photon field with a narrow energy distribution or with a sharp low energy cut - off around @xmath21 . in this case , @xmath0-rays are attenuated more effectively at energies @xmath22 than at energies @xmath23 , and therefore , for large optical depths ( @xmath24 ) , the emerging spectrum in the vhe band should gradually harden towards higher energies ( for detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "while the absorption of high energy @xmath0-rays in the inner parts of agn jets is generally possible , or even unavoidable in some cases @xcite , the detailed modeling of this process requires additional assumptions concerning the presence of low - frequency radiation fields , the location and size of the @xmath0-ray production region , the doppler factor of the jet , _ etc .",
    "_ we note that currently there is no observational evidence excluding the photon field properties required by @xcite , also in the case of bl lacs .",
    "remarkably , the internal absorption hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the non - thermal x - ray emission , namely as synchrotron radiation of secondary ( pair - produced ) electrons @xcite , which suggests a possible solution to the problem of low acceleration efficiency in leptonic models of high energy emission of blazars @xcite .    in the original paper ,",
    "@xcite presented a general description of the scenario with calculations of model seds , but the obtained spectra were not compared with available data . in the present paper , we discuss the multiwavelength properties of the radiation in the internal absorption scenario , and apply the model to the data of two distant agn , namely 1es  0229 + 200 ( @xmath14 ) and 3c  66a ( estimated at @xmath25 ) , detected in tev band @xcite . here",

    "@xcite can accommodate the fermi  lat upper limits .",
    "even so , the synchrotron spectrum would not be sufficiently hard to explain the @xmath0-ray spectrum corrected for the higher ebl flux ( model f1.6 ) . in this case",
    "the internal absorption becomes a key requirement to further harden the initial proton synchrotron spectrum ( see fits  1 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:0229 ] , and the corresponding parameters in table  [ table : parameters ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of secondary electron - positron pairs , calculated self - consistently with the hard vhe component , can explain the x - ray flux of 1es  0229 + 200 , with the caveat that the x - ray data are not simultaneous with the tev observations .",
    "a characteristic feature of the secondary synchrotron radiation is its broad spectral extension up to hard x - rays .",
    "this prediction can be tested with hard x - ray instruments like suzaku , or with future missions nustar and astro - h .      for the blazar 3c  66a ,",
    "we have combined the vhe spectrum reported by veritas with the spectrum detected by fermi - lat during the vhe flare , together with the available x - ray / optical data from mdm and swift @xcite .",
    "the observational data are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c66a ] and [ fig:3c66amwl ] .",
    "we have applied the internal absorption scenario as described in section  [ sec : model ] to fit the vhe spectrum , again considering both levels of ebl absorption ( f1.0 and f1.6 ) .    to correct for intergalactic absorption ,",
    "the redshift for the source we adopted is the one most often cited and used in the literature , @xmath25 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the redshift of this source is not yet firmly established , and thus one can not exclude that the source is located closer . in particular , @xcite suggested that the redshift should not exceed @xmath120 .",
    "this conclusion is based on the belief that the initial vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum can not be harder than the gev spectrum measured with fermi  lat . on the other hand ,",
    "if the redshift is indeed @xmath121 , the tev and gev parts look quite different , and not part of a single component . even though",
    ", this does not imply that they must be of different origin .",
    "in fact , our model can explain both components with a single proton population , as parts of the smooth proton synchrotron spectrum which is then deformed by the energy - dependent internal absorption .      in this case",
    "the de - absorbed tev spectrum is rather flat , with photon index @xmath99 , while the he component is characterized by a similar photon index @xmath122 but with at higher flux .",
    "a good agreement between the gev and tev spectra can be achieved assuming a proton energy distribution with power - law index @xmath117 .",
    "a weak internal absorption ( with maximum optical depth of about @xmath123 ) allows modification of the vhe spectrum to the required photon index ( fit  5 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c66a ] ) , while the he part is reproduced by the unmodified synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the synchrotron emission of secondary pairs can explain the x - ray spectrum obtained with swift but not the optical mdm data , which require an additional radiation component .",
    "the physical parameters used in this model may appear quite extreme ( see table  [ table : parameters ] , fit  5 ) .",
    "in particular , the very small value of the doppler factor has been chosen to avoid @xmath0-ray excess above @xmath57  tev , and this consequently leads to a dramatic increase of the required energy budget .",
    "in fact , there is a more natural way to suppress the flux level above @xmath57  tev , namely assuming a less efficient acceleration process . in this way",
    "the doppler factor and b - field may be increased , while the required energy budget will be significantly reduced .",
    "the detail study of this possibility will be discussed elsewhere .      for the high ebl flux a very small photon index of @xmath124 is required .",
    "remarkably , even such an unusual photon spectrum can be explained by internal absorption with a higher target photon temperature and slightly larger optical depth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c66a ] , fit  4 ) . with a certain combination of model parameters ,",
    "the flux of the synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons can match the levels detected in the optical band , as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c66amwl ] , fits  4a and 4b .",
    "for a small production region , the main fraction of the secondary pairs are produced outside the blob .",
    "their radiation is not doppler boosted and , therefore can not be detected . for the pairs produced inside the blob , the secondary synchrotron radiation is doppler boosted and thus it can contribute significantly to the observed fluxes .",
    "we note , however , that for this source we did not succeed to find a combination of parameters which could explain both the optical and x - ray fluxes together , by synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons . since the internal absorption scenario requires a significant attenuation of the vhe radiation over approximately two decades ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:0229 ] and [ fig:3c66amwl ] ) , the secondary synchrotron component has to be at least 4 decades broad ( with additional broadening related to the relativistic motion of the production region ) .",
    "the strong magnetic field required in the proton synchrotron model provides fast cooling of the pairs , thus the radiation spectrum will be featureless , without a cooling break . in the case of a small radius of the production region ,",
    "the effective particle injection in the blob may be rather narrow .",
    "but in this case the flux level would be significantly below the observed flux .",

    "one of the most challenging issues of the physics of tev blazars is the rather hard intrinsic @xmath0-ray spectra of some representatives of this high - energy source population .",
    "actually , the reported spectra themselves are steep , with photon indexes @xmath161 . however , the spectra of vhe @xmath0-rays after being corrected for the energy - dependent intergalactic absorption become very hard , in some cases as hard as @xmath162 , assuming the ebl flux from @xcite .",
    "note however that some other recent models , in particular @xcite , give very similar results .",
    "explanation of such spectra faces serious difficulties within the standard blazar models .",
    "moreover , even a slight increase of the ebl flux at optical and near ir wavelengths compared to the benchmark models ( which , given the significant uncertainties in the derivation of the ebl fluxes , can not be excluded ) results in unusually hard intrinsic spectra with @xmath163 .",
    "in this paper we studied the applicability of the idea of internal absorption of @xmath0-rays produced by highly magnetized blobs as a result of synchrotron radiation of protons .",
    "while the main aspects of the model have been developed and discussed in our previous paper @xcite , in this work we tried to understand whether the model can be applied to specific objects . for this purpose ,",
    "we have chosen two `` difficult '' representatives of this source population , 1es  0229 + 200 and 3c  66a , and allowed the ebl flux to be somewhat higher than the lowest possible fluxes .",
    "in particular , for the ebl level consistent with the lower limit around @xmath164 claimed by @xcite , the intergalactic @xmath0-@xmath0 de - absorption of the vhe flux detected from 3c  66a during a flaring episode results in an extremely hard spectrum , with photon index @xmath165 .",
    "while such a hard spectrum can not fit into any existing vhe @xmath0-ray production model , the scenario of internal absorption of @xmath0-rays produced via synchrotron radiation of protons provides a reasonable explanation of both the hard tev spectrum and the high gev flux observed during the flare .    in the case of 1es  0229 + 200",
    ", the internal absorption scenario calls for an extremely hard proton distribution , which can be provided for example by the  converter mechanism \" @xcite . the synchrotron radiation of secondary electron - positron pairs produced inside the blob results in an additional ( doppler boosted ) radiation component , which can provide a self - consistent interpretation of the non - thermal x - ray emission in both objects . however , since in the framework of the internal absorption scenario the secondary synchrotron component is expected to be quite broad and featureless , we failed to find a set of parameters which explains simultaneously both the optical and x - ray data obtained from 3c66a .",
    "the intrinsic absorption scenario allows a natural explanation of the very hard intrinsic tev spectra at the cost of a large attenuation of the @xmath0-ray flux around 100  gev .",
    "quite remarkably , despite the significant attenuation , this scenario does not enhance too dramatically the required energy budget .",
    "indeed , since the correction for intergalactic absorption requires the initial @xmath0-ray spectra to be very hard to begin with , with a photon index @xmath166 , the energy requirement to reproduce such a spectrum is determined by the highest energy part of the spectrum , which is not affected by internal absorption .",
    "typically , the enhancement of the energy budget introduced by internal absorption does not exceed a factor of 5 , which can be easily compensated by a slightly enhanced doppler boosting of the radiation .",
    "therefore the required intrinsic @xmath0-ray luminosities remain quite modest ( see table  [ table : parameters ] ) . given the very high ( almost 100% ) efficiency of conversion of the proton energy to @xmath0-rays through the synchrotron radiation in the magnetized blob , the suggested scenario can be treated as quite effective .",
    "it is apparent that the interpretation of very hard @xmath0-ray spectra by the internal absorption depends on the `` right '' choice of several model parameters , especially if we want to explain the x - ray data by synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons .",
    "nevertheless , we should note that the level of hardening of the vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum depends , in fact , only on the temperature of the photon field and the optical depth . on the other hand , while the flux ratio of the vhe @xmath0- and x - ray components depends mainly on the size of the production area , the location of the secondary synchrotron peak is sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field , to the photon temperature and the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "finally , we note that certain radiation features of the scenario do not depend on the model parameters at all .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the slope of the @xmath0-ray spectrum at gev energies , and the shape of the x - ray spectrum .    the dependence of the results of radiation properties on several parameters limits , to a certain extent , the predictive power of the suggested model .",
    "this is a consequence of complex environment in blazars where several radiation and absorption processes can proceed simultaneously . in this regard ,",
    "the often used one - zone models with consideration of only synchrotron and ic radiation components produced in the same region , are quite useful for understanding the basic aspects of the problem , but can hardly properly describe the complex scenarios that take place in blazars . in particular , the results of this paper demonstrate that the internal absorption not only can not be _ a priory _ excluded from the consideration , but , in fact , in some cases can be invoked for better explanation of observations of tev @xmath0-ray blazars .                                                                ,",
