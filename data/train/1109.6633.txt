    "the main idea behind the present work was to study the evolution of an initial perturbation on top of the background produced in heavy ion collisions , and to calculate measurable quantities such as the two particle correlations and the fourier coefficients of its expansion .",
    "however , before going into any of the details of our study we would like to start by talking about the background of the topic to be discussed and by giving some motivation for our calculations .",
    "+ when two relativistic heavy ions collide at experiments such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) a new form of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is created .",
    "there is evidence @xcite for the existence of a large elliptic flow -characterized by the fourier coefficient @xmath0- which is in agreement with hydrodynamical simulations , and thus supports the idea that the qgp behaves like a fluid and can be studied using hydrodynamics . for a long time",
    "hydrodynamic studies used smooth initial distributions from which the @xmath0 coefficient could be calculated but which due to symmetry considerations implied that all the odd coefficients in the fourier expansion of the particle distributions were zero .",
    "the work by alver and roland @xcite , where initial fluctuations due to the random positions of the nucleons in the nuclei were included , showed that the @xmath1 coefficient was of crucial importance for understanding the ridge and the double hump structure in two particle correlations . the @xmath1 and other large harmonics",
    "have now been measured experimentally @xcite for a wide range of centralities and this together with the fact that the @xmath0 coefficient is present at even the most central collisions strengthens the importance of the understanding of the initial state and its fluctuations . + in a previous work @xcite we used the glauber model to compute the initial deformations @xmath2 and angles @xmath3 up to @xmath4 , and found that there existed correlations between all odd harmonics , @xmath5 .",
    "we understood these correlations to be evidence for the presence of hot or cold spots ; initial perturbations to the background that will propagate during the dynamical evolution of the matter created in the collision . in this",
    "talk we will discuss the idea of sound propagating from these initial hot spots . the idea was introduced in @xcite and followed up in @xcite and @xcite , and consists mainly in sound circles that propagate from the initial perturbation and expand until freeze - out reaching the `` sound horizon '' radius .",
    "the excess of matter due to these circles would give rise to a particle distribution with two peaks or horns which has also been observed in the calculations done in @xcite . + this talk is mostly based on work done in @xcite , where we studied the evolution of an initial perturbation on top of the flow developed in @xcite by s. gubser and a. yarom .",
    "to simplify our calculations and to gain understanding of the way in which perturbations propagate , and their effects on measurable quantities such as the two particle correlations , we study the case with only one gaussian perturbation on top of the background temperature . using the tools from @xcite the initial state and its hydrodynamical evolution can be described analytically .",
    "it is important to notice that in order to do this we we will need to restrict ourselves to consider only central collisions with conformal matter satisfying @xmath6 and thus with a fixed speed of sound during the whole evolution .",
    "we will also need to limit ourselves to small perturbations since we will be using linearised solutions to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "+ the plan that we will follow in this talk is to start by placing a gaussian shaped initial perturbation on top of the background and allow it to evolve until freeze - out , where using the cooper - frye formula we obtain the particle distribution and from there the two particle correlation and the coefficients of its fourier expansion can be calculated and then compared to experimental data .",
    "in this section we present the evolution of an initial perturbation on top of the background flow but , before going into this , it is necessary to understand the background , so we give a summary of gubser s flow .",
    "let us briefly discuss gubser s flow which was developed in @xcite as a generalization to bjorken flow @xcite and extended in @xcite .",
    "the assumptions made by bjorken are as follows : boost invariance along the beamline , rotation invariance in the azimuthal angle @xmath7 around the beamline and translation invariance in the transverse plane .",
    "the first two of these premises are maintained by gubser , but the third one is modified by a special conformal transformation in order to take into account the finite size and the transverse expansion of the fireball .",
    "the solution can be found for conformal matter with equation of state @xmath8 , which implies a speed of sound @xmath9 . in coordinates",
    "@xmath10 the four - velocity is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 while the energy density corresponds to @xmath13 here @xmath14 is just a normalization constant and @xmath15 , which has units of inverse length , is the parameter that accounts for the finite size of the nucleus and for the radial flow .",
    "when q goes to zero the transverse velocity vanishes and bjorken s solution is recovered .",
    "+ the solution that we have just described can be re - derived if one uses transformation from the @xmath16 coordinates to a new set @xmath17 given by : @xmath18 and re - scales the metric as follows @xmath19 this was done in @xcite by gubser and yarom , and has the advantage that the fluid is now at rest ( the only non - zero component of the four - velocity is @xmath20 ) , so expressed in this new way the solution looks much simpler , and as we will see in the following section it is possible to analytically study perturbations on top of the background that it describes .",
    "the rescaled metric in the new coordinates reads : @xmath21 where , the new time coordinate is @xmath22 and the new radial coordinate is @xmath23 . for the the case with shear viscosity @xmath24",
    "the temperature in the rescaled frame is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization constant , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the hypergeometric function .      in real heavy ion collisions",
    "the fireball is not smooth but it presents fluctuations due to the random positions of the nucleons in the nuclei . in order to take this into account , following the calculations done in @xcite , we studied perturbations on top of gubser s flow .",
    "since we are interested in trying to understand the final two - particle correlations which present long range correlations in rapidity , we study only perturbations that are rapidity independent , this is perturbations in the transverse plane . the temperature and the four - velocity in the rescaled metric can be written as the background plus the perturbation in the form : @xmath29 where the perturbations correspond to @xmath30 by assuming that the perturbations are small , the hydrodynamic equations @xmath31 can be treated keeping only linear terms . by doing",
    "this one obtains a system of coupled first order differential equations , which in the ideal case may be decoupled to generate the following second order differential equation for the temperature perturbation @xmath32 using separation of variables the solution is found to be @xmath33 where the @xmath34 functions are given by combination of associated legendre polynomials times @xmath35 and the @xmath36 are spherical harmonics .",

    "the @xmath41 part of the solution does not change , but the @xmath22-dependent part does and it needs to be solved numerically in this case .",
    "the comparison between the ideal and the viscous case is presented in fig.[compare ] for three different values of l. these plots show the oscillatory behaviour of the solutions , which is more evident for larger l ; what begins as only a perturbation in temperature then becomes a perturbation in velocity and then keeps oscillating between them .",
    "the effect of viscosity can be seen for larger times , and it consists in a damping of the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "this damping is greater for larger l , so in the cases where viscosity is present the larger harmonics are suppressed , as we expected from the discussion in section ii a of @xcite .",
    "+ looking back to eq.[del ] , we see that at any given time @xmath22 the temperature perturbation is given in terms of spherical harmonics of the radial coordinate @xmath23 and the azimuthal coordinate @xmath7 , so we can use the completeness of these functions in order to write any initial condition as a sum of them by calculating the appropriate coefficients . in particular , at an initial time",
    "@xmath42 we used a gaussian perturbation in temperature with width @xmath43 localized at @xmath44 and @xmath45 given by @xmath46 and assumed zero initial perturbation to the velocity . by doing this",
    "we were able to write the temperature perturbation ( in the rescaled frame ) at any given time @xmath22 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the @xmath49 coefficients are calculated by using the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics and the initial conditions .",

    "in this section we present the single particle distribution , the two particle correlation and the power spectrum calculated from the perturbation that evolved on top of the background at freeze - out .      in order to calculate the particle distribution we used the cooper - frye formula @xcite @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 corresponds to the thermal distribution",

    "the shape of the freeze - out surface , and thus the freeze - out time , depends then on the temperature distribution : where the temperature was higher , the freeze - out time will be larger because it will take more time to reach the temperature of the freeze - out . in this way",

    "it is important to notice here that we have taken a qualitative approach ; we are interested in the shapes of the distributions and in the effects of viscosity and initial width of the perturbation , so we used arbitrary units , which is why we have suppressed the labelling of the y axis .",
    "the main features of the distribution are two horns with a dip in the middle which are centred around the initial position of the perturbation . in the ideal case",
    "there appears a bump in the middle of the dip , but it becomes less important when viscosity is included .",
    "other effects of viscosity are to damp and broaden the peaks and smooth out the curves .",
    "the width of the initial gaussian perturbation also affects the final particle distribution ; for a greater initial width the main characteristics of the curves are more pronounced : the maxima are larger and the minimum in the middle is more pronounced , also the width of the peaks is larger .",
    "this is because we kept the initial height of the perturbation and changed the width , so the total energy of the perturbation is larger , making the effects on the final distribution larger as well .",
    "we would now like to qualitatively compare our results to some experimental data . in order to do",

    "it is important to remember that gubser s flow that we use is an idealization , were matter is assumed to be conformal and to satisfy the equation of state @xmath6 , which implies a constant speed of sound @xmath9 throughout the whole evolution .",
    "this does nt happen in real heavy ion collisions , where the speed of sound varies .",
