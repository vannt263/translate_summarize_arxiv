    "fabrication of novel nanostructured spintronics devices and the related experimental studies of spin - dependent electron transport stimulate new theoretical approaches to the physical properties of nanosystems where quantum coherence effects can have a decisive role , in contrast to the mostly quasiclassical framework of the traditional electronics . one important class of such systems concerns spin valves @xcite formed by two ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers separated by a thin non - magnetic ( nm ) spacer .",
    "the magnetization of one of the fm layers ( called pinned layer ) is fixed by the bias from underlying antiferromagnetic ( afm ) layer , while the magnetization of the other fm layer ( free layer ) easily rotates when a small magnetic field is applied .",
    "this significantly affects the in - plane conductance , leading to relatively high mr values , typical for giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite , but the technology still demands further improvements .",
    "one of them consists in the introduction of nano - oxide layers ( nol s ) just above the free layer and inside the pinned layer ( so that the pinning is not disrupted ) @xcite .",
    "such nol - equipped device , the so called specular spin valve ( ssv , fig .",
    "[ spec1]b ) can more than double the gmr ratio of simpler stacks ( fig . [",
    "spec1]a ) .",
    "the increase of mr is believed to arise from the specular reflection of electrons at the fm / nol interfaces .",
    "but , besides the evident effect of carriers confinement , the reduced normal - to - plane scale @xmath1 of magnetic layers ( few nm thickness , controlled within a 1   precision ) might allow for a pronounced quantization of the normal component of quasi - momentum , as already indicated by the recent data on spin - resolved electronic reflection from magnetic nanolayers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the relevant modes at the fermi level for each polarization are dramatically restructured when the mutual polarization of magnetic layers is changed .",
    "all this can qualitatively change the kinetics of spin - dependent transport , compared to the usual diffusive scenario for a quasi - continuous spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the microscopic understanding of electron specular interface reflection is still far from complete , in particular its role in size quantization and coherence of fermi states . here",
    "we propose a theoretical description of these effects , through a properly modified boltzmann kinetic equation , taking into account the formation of transverse - quantized electronic subbands and spin - dependent specular reflection at the interfaces within the simplest tight - binding model , easy enough to advance up to numerical calculations of the mr behavior .",
    "let us begin from a single metal layer , made of @xmath2 atomic planes with simple cubic lattice coordination and hopping integral @xmath3 between nearest neighbors at distance @xmath4 .",
    "the respective electronic spectrum for given spin polarization @xmath5 and planar quasimomentum @xmath6 consists of @xmath2 subbands of the form @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ spec2 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath8 is the 2d dispersion law for a single plane , and in a ferromagnetic metal it is accompanied by the stoner energy shift @xmath9 for minority and majority spins respectively .",
    "the spatial quantization is accounted for by the subband shifts @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) which are the eigenvalues of the @xmath12 secular equation    |    ccccc & t & 0 &  & 0 + t & & t &  & 0 +  &  &  &  &  + 0 &  & t & & t + 0 &  & 0 & t &        to certify the above qualitative considerations , a detailed numerical calculation was done for the particular choice of parameters : @xmath13 ev , @xmath14 ev , @xmath15 ev ( a single - band model for real _ d_-bands of co and cu ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( a simple discrete structure of layers ) , and @xmath18 ev , and @xmath19 ( typical impurity parameters ) .",
    "the fermi velocities ( and their inverse values ) for two characteristic directions in brillouin zone were used to approximate the partial densities of states    @xmath20    ( @xmath21 being the length of respective fermi line , fig .",
    "[ spec4 ] ) , and then @xmath22 . the obtained numerical results for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are illustrated in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , respectively , for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 configurations .",
    "these numerical values lead to @xmath29% of magnetoresistance , that is quite close to the maximum possible mr = 100% in the coherent regime . to compare with , for purely incoherent currents there will be no mr at all in such two - layer system , so that the finite effect only appears from their partial mixing due to scattering at the interfaces @xcite and is estimated phenomenologically as @xmath30 of the above maximum value .    actually , the experimental mr values in specular spin valves @xcite are clearly lower than the above model estimates",
    ". this can be due to a number of important factors , not included into the present simple model ( which therefore should be considered as a certain idealized reference case ) .",
    "first of all , the postulated ideal specularity condition ( supposing the wave function fully confined within the @xmath2-plane system ) can not be exact in reality , and a considerable part of the electronic density can `` escape '' through the nol barriers to adjacent non - magnetic ( or afm ) layers .",
    "this part would act as a parallel conduction channel , mostly unchanged at reorientation of fm electrodes and hence restricting the magnetoresistive effect . also , the used model of rigid stoner shifts of spin subbands in fm electrodes of course overestimates sharpness of the spin - dependent energy barrier between these electrodes , where in fact the band structures are not uniform on scales of few atomic layers .",
    "other restrictive factors are the temperature effect ( by phonons and magnons ) , the roughness in the fm / nm interfaces and the presence of defects as grain boundaries , displacements and distortions in the crystalline structure , which all reduce the coherence of relevant quantum states and so the validity of the landauer formula . at last , the single - band model may be oversimplified , compared to the real hybridized _ s - d _ band structures of transition metals used in various numerical studies of spin - valves @xcite , but it would be rather problematic to keep the analytic description at such detailed level .",
    "nevertheless , a further development within the present model can be done , varying the number @xmath31 of relevant modes and admitting the presence of both spin polarizations among these modes .",
    "a simple single - band tight - binding model was developed to estimate theoretically the maximum possible enhancement of gmr in the system of quantum coherent fm nanolayers , using a specific set of boltzmann equations for spatially quantized and spin - resolved subbands and a landauer - type formula for the spin - dependent conductance .",
    "it is shown that a limit gmr value close to 100% can be reached for a fully coherent ( and fully specular ) ssv nanostructure and the reducing factors for this value in real ssv systems are discussed .",
