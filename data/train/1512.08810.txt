    "when a sunlight photon is absorbed by a light - sensitive molecule ( such as chlorophyll or carotenoid ) in a light - harvesting photosynthetic complex ( lhc ) , the photon energy is stored in the molecule in the form of an exciton , an excited electron state of the molecule .",
    "the exciton then travels very quickly ( some picoseconds ) inside the lhc and reaches the reaction center ( rc ) , where charge separation , and afterwards relatively slow chemical reactions take place @xcite .",
    "both the primary processes of exciton dynamics and charge separation occur in the presence of a protein ( and solvent ) environment at ambient temperature . in the framework of frster s resonance excitation transfer theory @xcite",
    ", the energy transfer is so fast that both fluorescence and recombination ( due to the environment ) can be neglected .    when modeling these primary exciton transfer ( et ) processes , the light - sensitive molecule is usually associated with a geometrically localized site , @xmath0 , having excited electron energy @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the total number of sites , @xmath2 , depends on the photosynthetic system .",
    "for example , @xmath3 in the cp29 lhc which is closely associated with photosystem ii ( psii ) @xcite .",
    "the sites interact via dipole - dipole ( or exchange ) interaction , which is described by matrix elements @xmath4 .",
    "similar to many molecular systems , the simplest unit of this picture is a dimer , which describes the interaction between two ( not necessarily neighboring ) sites .",
    "the dimer is characterized by a donor ( site @xmath0 ) and an acceptor ( site @xmath5 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the difference between the two excited electron energy levels .",
    "the donor and acceptor can be weakly coupled ( @xmath7 ) or they can be strongly coupled ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the dimer is embedded in , and interacting with , a protein - solvent environment .",
    "one then introduces the constants of interaction @xmath9 and @xmath10 characterizing the strength of the interaction between the dimer sites and the environment .",
    "the protein - solvent environment is characterized by its correlation function , which depends on the temperature and some parameters which describe the spectral density ( the ` spectral function ' ) of protein - solvent fluctuations at low and high frequencies . in order to describe different environmental effects",
    ", this correlation function can be taken to vary from a quite standard form @xcite to a rather complicated one @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the dimer is characterized by its @xmath11 time - dependent reduced density matrix , which is obtained from the ` total ' dimer - environment density matrix by averaging over ( tracing out ) the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced dimer dynamics is then formally equivalent to that of an effective spin @xmath12 .",
    "the protein - solvent environment is often modeled by a set of linear quantum oscillators ( bosonic degrees of freedom ) which characterize the dynamics of the protein and solvent atoms . in this",
    " spin - boson \" model , the interaction between the dimer and the environment is usually reduced to the self - consistent ( adiabatic ) renormalization of the dimer  donor \" and  acceptor \" energy levels @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for different approaches .",
    "this so - called  diagonal interaction \" @xcite can be generalized , if needed , to a ",
    "non - diagonal interaction \" @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the diagonal components of the reduced dimer density matrix ( relative to the energy basis ) is characterized by the et rate .",
    "the dynamics of the non - diagonal components of the reduced density matrix is characterized by the decoherence rate .",
    "it describes the evolution of quantum coherent effects which are currently the focus of intense theoretical and experimental studies @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "even the relatively simple spin - boson model has surprisingly many unresolved and rather subtle theoretical issues .",
    "the first one is related to the structure of the dimer electron energy spectrum .",
    "a real dimer based , for example , on two chlorophyll molecules , has many vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this means that the hilbert space of the electron energy spectrum of a dimer is in actual fact very complicated ( not two - dimensional ! ) , with the two - level effective spin @xmath12 system only being a reasonable approximation to reality .",
    "the second issue is related to the protein - solvent environment .",
    "there are many models which describe this environment , but there is no consensus or clear understanding as to which one is the right one @xcite .",
    "the third issue is related to the dimer - environment interaction .",
    "the problem is that the interaction constants @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 are not small ( compared to @xmath4 ) . a standard perturbation theory can therefore not be used .",
    "indeed , the famous marcus formula for the electron transfer rate , @xmath13 , from an initially populated donor has the form , @xmath14 @xcite , where the interaction constant , @xmath15 , appears in the denominators of both the prefactor and in the exponent . in the standard perturbation theory approach ( such as the bloch - redfield theory @xcite ) , the rate is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the marcus rate can not be derived by using a standard perturbative approach .    in this paper , we resolve the third issue mentioned above , i.e. , we develop a theory which allows for strong ( indeed , arbitrary ) values of the interactions .",
    "the donor and the acceptor of the dimer can be localized close to each other ( @xmath17 ) . for a protein - solvent environment",
    "whose correlation length exceeds this distance , it is reasonable to consider the donor and acceptor to be coupled to a single reservoir , a situation which we call the collective reservoir model .",
    "the opposite case , when each dimer site is coupled to its own , independent environment , is called the local reservoirs model .",
    "collective and local interactions were discussed previously in @xcite ( see also references therein ) and in @xcite for stochastic environments .",
    "the advantage of the current work is that our mathematical analysis is rigorous , meaning that any approximation made can be controlled , and conditions of validity of these approximations can be given .",
    "this is especially important because , as mentioned above , standard perturbation approaches can not be used .",
    "the main result of this work is a controlled expansion , for small @xmath4 , of the reduced dimer density matrix , valid for all times @xmath18 and for arbitrary coupling constants @xmath19 and temperatures @xmath20 . from this expansion ,",
    "we derive the rates of the processes of electron ( excitation ) transfer and decoherence .",
    "we show that in certain regimes , those rates coincide with the expressions obtained previously from the usual marcus formula .",
    "we discuss the conditions on the spectral function of the reservoir at low frequencies which lead to long - time quantum coherences .",
    "this issue is of significant interest in recent research on the et dynamics in lhcs , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ descrmodel ]",
    ", we describe the model and give an outline of our main results . in section [ mainresdetsect ] ,",

    "both dimer sites are coupled to the _ same _ , collective , heat bath . in the other one ,",
    "each dimer site is coupled to an _ independent _ , local , heat bath .",

    "these results exhibit a main term in the dynamics and a remainder which is _ controlled for all times @xmath53_. in order to derive the dynamical laws mathematically , we need to impose a regularity condition on the form factors @xmath54 , @xmath55 in , .",
