    "the tontine annuity  which was first promoted as a retirement income vehicle by lorenzo di tonti in the year 1653 ",
    "hasnt benefited from the best publicity over the last three and a half centuries .",
    "although at first tontines were used by british and french governments to finance their wars ( against each other ) , conventional fixed interest bonds ended up superseding them as the preferred method of deficit financing .",
    "private sector insurance companies in the 18th century offered tontine - like products , but they too were superseded by more familiar guaranteed life annuities and pensions .",
    "in fact , by the early 19th century regulators in the u.s . and the u.k .",
    "banned ( a derivative product called ) tontine insurance , although there is some debate over whether the ban actually applies to the tontines envisioned by tonti .",
    "legalities aside , in the words of the well - known financial writer edward chancellor , tontines are _",
    "`` one of the most discredited financial instruments in history . ''",
    "_ we refer the interested reader to the book by milevsky ( 2015 ) in which a slice of the tontine s colorful history is addressed . in this article our focus ( and contribution )",
    "is actuarial as opposed to political or historical .    in its purest financial form",
    "a tontine annuity can be viewed as a perpetual ( i.e. infinite maturity ) bond that is purchased from an issuer by a group of investors who agree to share periodic coupons only amongst survivors . as investors die and leave the tontine pool the coupons or cash flows earned by those who avoid death increase ( super ) exponentially over time . in theory",
    "the last remaining survivor receives all of the coupons until he or she finally dies and the issuer s obligations to make payments are terminated .",
    "one can alternatively think of the tontine annuity as consisting of a portfolio of zero coupon bonds ( zcbs ) with staggered maturities or face values in which the final zcb matures at the maximum possible lifespan of the investors in the pool , e.g. age 125 .",
    "cash flows from maturing zcbs are distributed equally among survivors . from this perspective",
    "the cash - flow pattern can be fined - tuned to any desired profile as long as its present value is equal to the amount invested by the group .",
    "the tontine pool retains longevity risk in the sense that if people live longer than expected their payments are reduced relative to what they might have expected at time zero . like other pooled schemes we will discuss  such as those described in piggott et .",
    "( 2005 ) , stamos ( 2008 ) , or donnelly et .",
    "( 2014 )  with a _ retirement income tontine _ there is no entity guaranteeing fixed payments for life , thus eliminating capital requirements .",
    "we use the term _ retirement income tontine _ to differentiate our scheme from a `` winner take all '' bet in which the payoff is deferred to the last survivor and to remind the reader of the pension - like structure .      over the past few centuries",
    "there has been quite a bit of popular and scholarly criticism leveled against tontine schemes .",
    "overall these concerns can be placed into three broad categories .",
    "the first concern is that tontines themselves are amoral because one immediately benefits from someone s death .",
    "a more refined version of this concern is that they create an incentive for fraud , murder and other criminal activity .",
    "these critics contend that as the size of the tontine pool shrinks the surviving members are incentivized to kill each other to gain a bigger share of the tontine pool .",
    "this colorful perception of the tontine permeates literary fiction and is the subject of many novels , but has no basis in reality .",
    "most historical tontine schemes capped or limited payouts once a small fraction ( say 5 to 10 members ) remained in the pool . despite all the fictional novels there",
    "simply is no documented evidence that the last few survivors of a national tontine ever murdered each other .",
    "in fact , with hundreds of people in the tontine pool the economic benefit from nefariously reducing the pool size is minimal . the ethical concern that investors would benefit directly from death",
    "can be dismissed outright within the actuarial community since that is the foundation of all pension and annuity pricing . as for the concern with fraud",
    ", this indeed was a problem in the 17th and 18th century when documenting life and death was unreliable but can also be dismissed in the 21st century with modern record - keeping systems .",
    "the second concern with tontine annuities relates to economic optimality and cash flow patterns . in lorenzo",
    "s tontine scheme the cash paid to the group remained relatively constant ( i.e. the numerator ) but the number of survivors ( i.e. the denominator ) declined more - than exponentially fast over time , resulting in a rapidly increasing payout to surviving members .",
    "this explosive profile of income is at odds with the economic desire for ( stable ) consumption smoothing .",
    "it is assumed that older retired investors would want a stable or perhaps even declining real cash - flow over time , notwithstanding concerns about health - care expenses and inflation for the elderly . according to these critics",
    "the tontine annuity is nt an optimal economic contract . but",
    "this concern can also be remedied with proper product design .",
    "there is no reason why the cash - flows to the group should be structured to remain constant over time . as mentioned above ,",
    "the zcbs payments to the pool could decline ( faster than ) exponentially at the same rate as ( expected ) mortality .",
    "in fact , this is the essence of milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) . to sum up",
    ", we believe the second objection can be easily overcome .",
    "the third concern is a more - subtle one and has to do with the pooling of cohorts and the age profile of the tontine .",
    "that is the core focus on this paper . if one allows anyone regardless of age to participate equally in the same tontine annuity pool",
    " which we do not  there would be an immediate transfer of wealth from the members who are expected to die early ( i.e. the old ) to those who are expected to live the longest ( i.e. the young ) .",
    "historical tontines  such as the one first issued by the english government in the late 17th century  discriminated against the old in favor of the young .",
    "thus , for example , in the earliest english tontine schemes the nominees on whose life the tontine was contingent ranged in age from a few months to over the age of 50 . in equilibrium everyone should nominate the healthiest possible age ( females age 10 , approximately ) , but that leads to design problems when the nominee and annuitant are not the same person . if indeed one requires homogenous mortality pools to run a non - discriminating tontine scheme then this limits the possible size of the pool and the efficacy of large number diversification .",
    "the 18th century tontine schemes in which investors were placed into small tailored classes  with different payouts based on age  suffered from reduced pooling and risk diversification .",
    "a modern day pension fund trying to implement a tontine payout structure with a predictable cash flow would face the same concern unless it had a very large pool of willing retirees with identical ages and health profiles .    in some sense , we believe this is the most serious criticism against resurrecting retirement income tontines in the context of modern pension schemes .",
    "one would require hundreds of people of exactly the same age retiring on exactly the same day , to reduce the variability of payouts .",
    "in fact , this is one reason why authors such as piggot , valdez and detzel ( 2005 ) or donnelly , guillen and nielsen ( 2014 ) have proposed pooled annuitization schemes or overlays that allow for mixing of different cohorts over multiple generations .",
    "note that we will not wade into a debate over which among the many pooling schemes is _ better .",
    "_ in fact there is quite a bit of overlap between them as we will soon demonstrate .",
    "moreover there will be a tradeoff .",
    "a scheme that squeezes out the highest possible utility for the group may also be more complex to analyze and harder to explain .    in sum , we choose to analyze tontines which offer a design that provides `` good '' utility while remaining sufficiently simple that we can establish a range of qualitative results .",
    "we understand and acknowledge that other designs have their own appeal and role .      as stated above , it is this third criticism leveled against ( retirement income ) tontines that we address in the current paper .",
    "our remedy to this concern is to allow cohorts of different ages ( and mortality ) to mix in the same pool by allocating different participation rates or shares based on their age at the time of purchase .",
    "for example , a 55 year - old allocating @xmath0 to the tontine might be told to pay $ 200 per share and receive 50 shares , while a 75 year - old allocating @xmath2 might pay @xmath140 per share and receive 200 shares .",
    "they would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share would have equal income rights .",
    "now , it might seem rather trivial ( actuarially ) to allocate shares in the tontine based on the age of the investor and the size of their investment .",
    "after all , with an immediate annuity , $ 1 of lifetime income will cost @xmath3 for a 45-year old and @xmath4 for a 75 year - old .",
    "the relative prices of mortality - contingent claims are well understood in the actuarial literature .",
    "but what may not be obvious is that in fact there are situations ( i.e. counter examples ) in which this can not be done in a fair ( or even equitable ) manner , especially when the groups are small . in other words , there are cases in which no mapping or share price will allow groups to be mixed without discrimination .",
    "our objective is to understand when this is ( or is not ) possible .",
    "the need for large pools to diversify risk is linked to the issues addressed in this paper and is a question that has recently been highlighted by donnelly ( 2015 ) as well .",
    "we return to this later .    as far as terminology is concerned , in this paper we are careful to distinguish between a scheme that is _ fair _ and a scheme that is _ equitable _ , which is a somewhat weaker requirement . a retirement income tontine scheme in which there is a possibility of everyone in the pool dying before the maximum age and thus leaving left - overs",
    "can never be made _ fair _ , in the sense of donnelly ( 2015 ) unless it incorporates some form of payment to estates . by the word _",
    "fair _ we mean that the expected present value of income will always be less than the amount contributed or invested into the tontine .",
    "however , a heterogeneous tontine scheme can often ( though not always ) be made _",
    "equitable _ by ensuring that the present value of income ( although less than the amount contributed ) is the same for all participants in the scheme regardless of age .",
    "this scheme will not discriminate against any one cohort although it wo nt be fair .",
    "all of this will be addressed in detail including an analysis of scenarios in which equity is impossible to achieve .",
    "to recap then , in this paper we investigate how to construct a multi - age tontine scheme and determine the proper share prices to charge participants so that it is equitable and does nt discriminate against any age or any group .",
    "the tontine we propose is a closed pool that does not allow anyone to enter ( or obviously exit ) after the initial set - up .",
    "this is one further place we differ from the designs of piggott et .",
    "( 2005 ) , donnelly et .",
    "2014 ) , or ( in the tontine context ) sabin ( 2010 ) .",
    "that is , we advocate closing the group to newcomers , but allow multiple ages and contribution levels within the closed pool .",
    "again , we refrain from arguing that this is better or worse than any other design . that said , our model requires and assumes little ( if any ) _ actuarial discretion _ as time evolves .",
    "the rules are set at time zero and the cash - distribution algorithm is crystal clear .",
    "we believe this design has merit .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ]",
    "we summarize the results of milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) and the economic optimality of tontines in the context of a single homogeneous cohort of subscribers .",
    "indeed , there are many possible payout functions @xmath5 that one can use to construct a tontine scheme  historically the @xmath5 curve was constant , for example 8% per year  and the optimal function depends ( at a minimum ) on the representative investor s coefficient of risk aversion .",
    "a particularly natural payout function arises as the @xmath5 that optimizes logarithmic utility preferences . in this section",
    "we also offer a brief comparison to other pooling schemes . section [ sec : mixing ]",
    "moves from a review of single cohorts to the introduction of multiple cohorts , which is the contribution of the current paper .",
    "it describes in precise terms what is meant by an equitable share price for all participants in a tontine scheme given a particular payout function @xmath5 . in that section",
    "we offer a more precise definition of the notion of fairness and how it differs from equitable .",
    "section [ sec : utility ] returns to the matter of economic optimality .",
    "it is typically impossible to locate a payout function @xmath5 that is optimal for all cohorts , as was possible in the case of a single cohort , even if all participants have the same level of risk aversion .",
    "indeed , the best that one can hope for when mixing cohorts is an equitable scheme and not a uniformly optimal one . in section",
    "[ sec : natural ] we propose that a good selection from among all the possible equitable schemes is one in which the payout function @xmath5 is proportional to the expected number of shares outstanding at any point in the future .",
    "alas , we ca nt yet prove uniqueness for this scheme and leave this as a conjecture .",
    "we do however discuss welfare gains and losses from the scheme and provide some numerical examples .",
    "section [ sec : others ] makes comparisons with other product designs that exist in the literature and discusses conditions under which they overlap .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes and offers some suggestions and avenues for further research .",
    "proofs appear in the appendix ( section [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "in this section we briefly review the _",
    "optimal _ tontine scheme proposed in milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) .",
    "we assume an objective survival function @xmath6 , for an individual aged @xmath7 to survive @xmath8 years .",
    "one purpose of the tontine structure is to insulate the issuer from the risk of a stochastic ( or simply mis - specified ) survival function , but in this paper we assume @xmath6 is given and applies to all individuals .",
    "we intend to address the stochastic case in subsequent work .",
    "we assume that the tontine pays out continuously as opposed to quarterly or monthly .",
    "for ease of exposition we assume a constant risk - free interest rate @xmath9 , though it would be easy to incorporate a term structure .",
    "what makes the tontine a simple and inexpensive product to build and manage is that the payouts are known from the beginning and can be engineered ( without active management ) by a simple portfolio of zcbs .",
    "the basic comparator for a tontine is an annuity in which annuitants each pay $ 1 to the insurer initially and receive in return an income stream of @xmath10 for life .",
    "the constraint on these annuities is that they are fairly priced , in other words that with a sufficiently large client base the initial payments invested at the risk - free rate will fund the called - for payments in perpetuity .",
    "this implies a constraint on the annuity payout function @xmath11 , namely that @xmath12 again , @xmath11 is the payout rate per survivor .",
    "the payout rate per initial dollar invested is @xmath13 .",
    "letting @xmath14 denote the instantaneous utility of consumption , a rational annuitant ( with lifetime @xmath15 ) having no bequest motive will choose a life annuity payout function for which @xmath11 maximizes the discounted lifetime utility : @xmath16=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-rt}{}_tp_x\\ , u(c(t))\\,dt \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is ( also ) the subjective discount rate ( sdr ) , all subject to the constraint .",
    "provided @xmath17 is strictly concave , the following now follows from the euler - lagrange theorem .",
    "optimized life annuities have constant @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "[ thm : annuity ]    this result can be traced back to yaari ( 1965 ) who showed that the optimal ( retirement ) consumption profile is constant ( flat ) and that 100% of wealth is annuitized when there is no bequest motive , subjective discount rates are equal to interest rates and complete annuity markets ( actuarial notes ) are available .      in practice ,",
    "insurance companies funding the life annuity @xmath11 are exposed to both systematic longevity risk ( due to randomness or uncertainty in @xmath6 ) , model risk ( the risk that @xmath6 is mis - specified ) , as well as re - investment or interest rate risk  a static bond portfolio can replicate the tontine payout over the medium term , but not beyond 30 years .",
    "the latter is not our focus here so we will continue to assume that @xmath9 is a given constant for most of what follows .",
    "this brings us to the tontine structure introduced in milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) , in which a predetermined dollar amount is shared among survivors at every @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the rate at which funds are paid out per initial dollar invested , a.k.a .",
    "the tontine payout function .",
    "there is no reason for the tontine payout function to be a constant fixed percentage of the initial dollar invested ( e.g. 4% or 7% ) as it was historically .",
    "getting back to the issue of optimality , we can pose the same question as considered above for annuities : what @xmath5 is best for subscribers ?",
    "the comparison is now between @xmath5 and @xmath13 , where @xmath11 is the optimal annuity payout found above .",
    "suppose there are initially @xmath20 subscribers to the tontine scheme , each depositing a dollar with the tontine sponsor .",
    "let @xmath21 be the random number of live subscribers at time @xmath8 .",
    "consider one of these subscribers .",
    "given that this individual is alive , @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , the number of other ( live ) subscribers at any time @xmath8 is binomially distributed with probability parameter @xmath6 .",
    "as in the yaari ( 1965 ) model , this individual s discounted lifetime utility is @xmath23=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-rt}{}_tp_x \\,e[u\\big(\\frac{n d(t)}{n(t)}\\big)\\mid",
    "\\zeta > t]\\,dt\\\\ & \\qquad=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-rt}{}_tp_x\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } \\binom{n-1}{k}{}_tp_x^k(1-{}_tp_x)^{n-1-k}u\\big(\\frac{nd(t)}{k+1}\\big)\\,dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constraint on the tontine payout function @xmath5 is that the initial deposit of @xmath20 should be sufficient to sustain withdrawals in perpetuity . of course , at some point all subscribers will have died .",
    "so in fact the tontine sponsor will eventually be able to cease making payments , leaving a small remainder or windfall .",
    "this gets to the issue of _ fairness _ , which we revisit in the next section . but this final - death time is not predetermined , so we treat that profit as an unavoidable feature of the tontine .",
    "remember that we do not want to expose the sponsor to any longevity risk .",
    "it is the pool that bears this risk entirely .",
    "our budget or pricing constraint is therefore that @xmath24    so , for example , if @xmath25 is forced to be constant , i.e. a _",
    "flat tontine _ as was typical historically , then the tontine payout function ( rate ) is simply @xmath26 ( or somewhat more if a cap on permissible ages is imposed , replacing the upper bound of integration in by a value less than infinity ) .",
    "the _ optimal _",
    "@xmath5 is in fact far from constant .",
    "milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) find this optimum in some generality .",
    "the following summarizes the conclusion in the case of crra utility @xmath27 for @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) .",
    "set @xmath32    the optimal retirement income tontine structure has @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is chosen to make hold .",
    "[ thm : cohortoptimal ]    for an illustration of the typical such @xmath5 , see figure [ fig03 ] .",
    "tontines are not the only alternative to annuities that have been investigated in the actuarial literature .",
    "two such product designs are the _ group self annuitization scheme _ ( gsa ) of piggott , valdez and detzel ( 2005 ) , and the optimal _ pooled annuity fund _",
    "( paf ) analyzed by stamos ( 2008 ) .",
    "we will describe these designs in section [ sec : others ] .",
    "but for those already familiar with them we make some comparisons now , that may help set the context for our results .",
    "first of all , there is some degree of overlap between the three designs .",
    "in fact , for a homogeneous pool as described above , invested in risk - free assets , it turns out that a gsa agrees with a tontine having payout @xmath35 . following milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) we call this design a _",
    "natural tontine for the age-@xmath7 cohort_. that paper showed that this design is optimal for logarithmic utility ( @xmath31 ) , since @xmath36 .",
    "for heterogeneous pools however , the gsa will not be a tontine at all , since the total payout will be random ( and path dependent ) , rather than deterministic ( which is the defining feature of a tontine ) . in the same context it turns out that the paf which is optimal for logarithmic utility also agrees with a natural tontine . for risk aversion @xmath29 in contrast",
    ", the total paf payout will be path - dependent , so again it is not a tontine . recall that the main defining feature of the tontine is the predictability of cash - flows ( numerator ) distributed to the pool .",
    "we will make these claims precise in section [ sec : others ] , but at this point we will simply content ourselves with table [ table09 ] .",
    "@xmath37 it compares the certainty equivalent of investments in all three products yielding the same utility as $ 100 in an annuity . as must be the case , a ( fairly priced ) annuity provides the highest utility , followed by the paf , then the tontine and then the gsa . moreover the three agree when @xmath31 .",
    "but the principal conclusion is that the three designs yield utilities that are very similar , even with a ( very ) small pool of investors .",
    "if the annuity is not fairly priced , e.g. if capital risk charges are imposed upon an annuity , in the form of a loading factor that protects against systematic mortality risk , then any of the three designs can easily provide higher utility to the consumer than the annuity .",
    "note that in table [ table09 ] we do not include the gsa scheme for @xmath38 or 5 , because in fact it has mean utility @xmath39 once @xmath40 .",
    "this is an artifact of taking an infinite horizon and in the context of a natural tontine is discussed at greater length in section a.3 of the appendix of milevsky and salisbury ( 2015 ) . as indicated there , the disproportionate influence of extreme ages could be circumvented by capping payments at some advanced age such as 110 .",
    "now suppose a retirement income tontine pays out @xmath5 per initial dollar invested , which may ( or may not ) be optimal for people of a given age .",
    "in other words , an inhomogeneous group of individuals subscribe to purchase shares in the tontine .",
    "each subscriber will be entitled to a share of the total funds disbursed in proportion to the number of shares owned , with the sole caveat that the subscriber must be alive at the time of disbursement .",
    "once the list of subscribers is known , together with the dollar value they will invest , they are each quoted a price per share depending on their age and the size of their investment ( and more generally , the ages and investments of all subscribers ) . of course , the price then determines the number of shares they will receive in return for their announced investment .",
    "the issue we wish to address is how to assign prices in an equitable manner which we will take to mean that the expected present value of funds received by the various subscribers ( per initial dollar invested ) are all equal .",
    "the mathematical question becomes whether there exists a collection of share prices that realize this and whether such prices are unique .",
    "let @xmath20 be the number of subscribers . for computational purposes it will sometimes be convenient to group them into @xmath41 homogeneous cohorts ( i.e. with the same age and contribution level ) , though this is not actually a restriction since we could choose to take @xmath42 and deem each cohort to consist of a single individual .",
    "we will use notation that permits grouping , but in many proofs will ( without loss of generality ) take cohorts to consist of single individuals .",
    "for @xmath43 let @xmath44 be the initial age of individuals in the @xmath45th cohort , and let @xmath46 be the number of dollars each of them invests .",
    "let @xmath47 be the size of the @xmath45th cohort , so @xmath48 and the total initial investment is @xmath49",
    ". therefore the total time-@xmath8 payouts occur at rate @xmath50 . for notational convenience ,",
    "we choose to base prices on _ participation rates _",
    "@xmath51 , in other words , @xmath52 is the @xmath45th subscriber s price per share .",
    "let @xmath53 be the number of shares purchased by each individual in the @xmath45th cohort , and let @xmath54 be the total number of shares purchased .",
    "let @xmath55 be the number in the @xmath45th cohort who survive to time @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath5 function satisfies the budget constraint @xmath56 , where @xmath9 is the interest rate .",
    "an individual in the @xmath45th cohort who survives to time @xmath8 will receive payments at a rate of @xmath57 summing this over all subscribers of course gives back a total payout rate of @xmath50 , as long as at least one subscriber survives .",

    "in other words , it is typically impossible to make everyone happy simultaneously .",
    "this is one reason we feel it is reasonable to first fix a tontine structure @xmath5 ( as we have done above ) , and then allow people participate at equitable rates if they so wish .",
    "naturally , this means one of the questions we will need to answer is how significant their utility loss is , when doing so .",

    "this is more complicated than ( as above ) simply fixing a @xmath5 and computing equitable @xmath72 s , but not unduly so ( at least when the number @xmath41 of types is small ) .    the following two tables ( table [ table03 ] for @xmath92 cohorts , table [ table04 ] for @xmath165 ) @xmath166 display such natural and equitable tontines , and",
    "compare them to `` natural '' tontines that would have been chosen if the population had been homogeneous ( but with equitable participation rates ) .",
    "we also compare with the corresponding proportional tontines , though those are not equitable . though the theoretical basis of proportional tontines is not as appealing as that of natural ones , they are simpler to compute , and they do appear to perform reasonably in practice .",
    "we view them as an acceptable alternative if computational resources are not available to work out equitable @xmath51 s and natural @xmath5 s .",
    "note that since these tables normalize @xmath72 to make @xmath167 for some @xmath45 , this means that the proportional tontine has @xmath168 .",

    "equitable @xmath72 s are then computed . in row",
    "a , both @xmath169 and @xmath170 start negative ( @xmath171 ) , meaning that the benefit of the extra participant outweighs the impact of heterogeneity . as the common value of @xmath172 rises , the @xmath121",
    "become positive and defects in the design become more relevant .",
    "in particular , loadings remain strictly positive asymptotically  while the product becomes essentially an annuity , it is not an optimal one . note that the loadings are not actually monotone . adding participants is more beneficial for older ( age 75 ) participants than for younger ( age 65 ) ones .",
    "surprisingly , in the presence of age 65 participants , even the age 75 ones get more benefit from an age-65 design over an age-75 one .",
    "rows labelled `` b '' correspond to a truly natural and equitable design .",
    "rows labelled `` c '' are proportional designs . in most cases , either performs better for both cohorts than the homogeneous designs do .",
    "the problem with the a design is now clear  to be equitable it requires a higher participation rate @xmath173 , which dilutes the benefit of adding individuals to the tontine , and produces utility loss .",
    "in contrast , rows b and c typically show a negative loading ( i.e. a utility gain ) , though with different choices of parameters ( not shown ) this can in fact sometimes not be the case .    comparing b and c ,",
    "it is generally the case that the older cohort prefers a natural design , whereas the younger cohort prefers a proportional design .",
    "the proportional design comes closer to equalizing the utility gains between the cohorts .",
    "the two designs perform similarly asymptotically .",
    "the factor contributing most to their difference is the equitability of @xmath72 rather than the choice of @xmath5  using the proportional @xmath5 but equitable @xmath72 s would turn out to give very similar utilities to the fully natural design",
    ".    table [ table04 ] treats the three - cohort case , comparing the natural and proportional designs with a design that would be natural for the age-65 cohort alone .",
    "now all three designs have very similar effects on utility .",
    "otherwise the table is consistent with empirical observations made above : adding people to the tontine is generally favourable ( despite heterogeneity ) ; and the utility improvement is greater for the older participants . note that the good performance of these designs may in part be a consequence of a balance between ages 60 and 70  asymetric designs ( not shown ) are less consistent .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] shows a simulation of the payouts from a 2-cohort natural and equitable design with @xmath174 members and @xmath175 members .",
    "note that at moderate ages it comes close to achieving a constant and steady payout to each survivor .",
    "there is higher volatility in payments at advanced ages , once the number of survivors in the pool is small .",
    "mitigating that volatility would be a requirement for a practical tontine design .",
    "in fact , we believe this is not hard to achieve , for the following reason : our tontines are designed to be optimal when individuals have no exogenous income . in reality there is typically some exogenous pension income ( eg .",
    "social security ) .",
    "unpublished work by ashraf ( 2015 ) suggests that in the presence of exogenous income , optimal tontines should be designed to taper off and cease payments at advanced ages ( eg by age 100 ) .",
    "if this is done , then by the time the survivor pool is very small , any variability in its size will no longer matter .",
    "natural and equitable tontines appear to exist for a broad range of parameter values ( though not universally  the obstruction raised in section [ sec : mixing ] still remains valid ) .",
    "but we have not yet succeeded in finding necessary and sufficient conditions for existence , or in establishing uniqueness , as in theorem [ thm : existence ] . therefore resolving",
    "the following remains a topic for further research .",

    "there will exist a choice of @xmath65 such that the corresponding natural tontine is equitable .",
    "up to an arbitrary multiplicative constant , there is at most one such @xmath72 .",
    "as indicated earlier , there are a number of other product designs in the actuarial literature that hedge the idiosyncratic component of longevity risk but not the systematic component . in this section",
    "we discuss some of those alternatives .      in the homogeneous setting ,",
    "the optimal paf was derived in stamos ( 2008 ) , and its utility ( or loading in our terminology ) compared to a ( variable ) life annuity was investigated in donnelly et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "we are not aware of work on such optimal paf s in the heterogeneous setting , though an approach like that of this paper ( i.e. fix a payout mechanism and then allocate shares equitably ) could probably be carried out in this context .",
    "paf s in general allow a diversified investment portfolio , but we will consider only risk - free portfolios .",
    "in other words , this section treats paf s invested purely in bonds ( at rate @xmath9 ) with a homogeneous pool of subscribers .",
    "a paf allows the rate @xmath177 at which each individual is paid to vary with @xmath8 , but also with the number of survivors @xmath178 and with the individual s share @xmath179 of total assets under management @xmath180 ( so @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) . for a given risk - aversion coefficient @xmath29 , stamos ( 2008 )",
    "obtains the utility - optimizing payout rates @xmath183 , and shows that they take the form @xmath184 for some function @xmath185 .",
    "the extra flexibility means this provides higher utility than a tontine ( where dependence on @xmath69 and @xmath186 is not allowed , other than indirectly via the initial number @xmath20 of subscribers ) .",
    "table [ table09 ] indeed shows a modest improvement .",
    "it comes at the expense of dealing with a more complex product .",
    "for example , a prospectus would have to provide the full table of @xmath185 s and that complexity may make it harder for subscribers to understand ( and then manage ) the risks associated with the product .",
    "the payout to an individual will no longer be predictable in terms of the current number @xmath187 of survivors , i.e. it will be path - dependent",
    ". a general paf will also require the fund manager to adjust the portfolio in response to the observed mortality experience of the pool , rather than relying on a static bond portfolio .",
    "so there are both advantages and disadvantages to each design .    to compare with our tontines payout @xmath5 , we let @xmath188 denote the total payout rate , per initial dollar invested .",
    "we assume that each individual invests $ 1 initially , so @xmath189 .",
    "an observation , that we have not seen recorded in the literature , is that when @xmath31 ( in the setting described above ) , the total withdrawals from the optimal paf become deterministic . in other words ,",
    "this paf is a tontine ( and therefore must be the natural tontine ) :    assume a homogeneous pool , with assets invested risk - free at rate @xmath9 . assume logarithmic utility .",
    "then the optimal paf has @xmath190 .",

    "simulates both total payouts @xmath5 and @xmath191 , and individual payouts @xmath192 and @xmath193 , for @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and a small pool of size @xmath196 .",
    "the utility improvement from the paf appears to derive from a modest reduction in the volatility of individual payouts . with a larger pool of size @xmath197 , the difference in either total or individual payouts ( not shown )",
    "become negligible , except at quite advanced ages .",
    "@xmath198      the gsa scheme was proposed in piggott , valdez , and detzel ( 2005 ) .",
    "it provides a rule for managing payments from a pool of assets , so does not depend on risk aversion , nor does it attempt to optimize utility . on the other hand , it allows for a heterogeneous pool , and variable asset returns , though as in other sections of this paper , we will focus here on the case of a fixed rate of return @xmath9 .",
    "the general gsa scheme also allows new individuals to join over at times @xmath199 , by valuing each survivor s share of current assets , and then allowing new individuals to buy in at an actuarially fair price .",
    "a similar approach could be used to add this feature to the tontines considered in the current paper , but we do not pursue this idea here .",
    "we will therefore treat only gsas in which all investors buy - in at time 0 .",
    "a gsa scheme works as follows , in discrete time : members of the @xmath45th cohort each contribute @xmath46 at time 0 .",
    "this entitles them to an initial payment matching that an annuity would provide . at later times @xmath200 , everyone s payment",

    "suppose first that all cohorts have the same age @xmath213 , but possibly different initial contributions @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath214 so the above recurrence implies that @xmath215 and @xmath210 are both deterministic ( i.e. tontine - like ) .",
    "we have not seen this conclusion recorded in the literature .",
    "moreover @xmath216 . from a standard actuarial recursion",
    ", this implies that @xmath217 , from which we obtain    assume a pool whose cohorts have the same initial age @xmath213 and contribute @xmath46 at time 0 .",
    "assume that assets are invested risk - free at rate @xmath9 .",
    "then the total gsa payout is @xmath218 , while individual payouts are @xmath219 .",

    "this is consistent with the results of donnelly ( 2015 ) who shows that a gsa scheme is only fair in the homogeneous case .",
    "as noted earlier , to achieve fairness , she has to include payments to estates . in this case , during the final period when anyone is alive , all who die are deemed to receive the remaining assets distributed in the proportions set by the gsa rules .    in the fully heterogeneous case ( variability in both initial ages and initial investments )",
    ", there is no reason that either wealth or total withdrawals should be deterministic . in other words ,",
    "the gsa is no longer tontine - like .",
    "it turns out that the appropriate tontine to compare with in this case is what we have called a proportional tontine . to start with , the gsa payouts ( resp .",
    "proportional tontine payout rates ) are always proportional to the initial payout @xmath222 ( resp",
    ". initial payout rate @xmath223 ) .",
    "in fact , any deviation between the gsa and proportional tontine payouts derives either from the discrete - time formulation of the gsa , or from deviations of the survival counts @xmath55 from their means  it can be shown ( though we will not give details ) that if each @xmath224 agreed with @xmath225 , then in the limit as @xmath220 , the two cash flow streams would agree precisely . more concretely ,",
    "as figure [ fig05 ] shows , the actual payment streams are quite close even for small @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath226      donnelly , guillen and nielsen ( 2014 ) formulate another design , known as an _ annuity overlay fund _ ( aof ) , as a way of pooling individual investment accounts in order to capture mortality credits .",
    "the overlay pays out the assets of individuals who die in a period , in proportion to all who belong to the pool at the beginning of the period ( including those who die ) .",
    "it does so in proportion to both the individual s assets at risk in the pool , and to the individual s hazard rate .",
    "the aof is designed to work with arbitrary investment and withdrawal decisions by participants , so it seeks to achieve actuarial fairness over every period , as opposed to simply over the lifecycle .",
    "this is a very different objective than that of a tontine or annuity , whose goal is providing stable lifetime income .",
    "we should therefore not expect the two designs to behave similarly .",
    "another design is the",
    "_ fair transfer plan _ ( ftp ) of sabin ( 2010 ) . only living participants receive payments .",
    "so ( as in the current paper ) sabin s goal is not actuarial fairness , but rather to ensure that no individual has an advantage over another ( i.e. what we call equitability ) . on the other hand , he requires this to be achieved over every period ( as in donnelly et al ( 2014 ) ) , rather than once over the lifecycle , which means that his design is not comparable to ours .",
    "we note that he does obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an equitable ftp , in his context .",
    "there is a growing interest among practitioners and academics in the optimal design of retirement de - accumulation products that insure against idiosyncratic longevity risk while sharing aggregate exposure within a group . in this paper",
    "we investigated the design of a retirement income tontine scheme that allows individuals with different mortality rates to participate in the same pool . and",
    "while this scheme might not be actuarially _ fair _ , in the sense of donnelly ( 2015 ) , this scheme is _ equitable _ in that the scheme does not discriminate against any particular sub - group and all participants receive the exact same expected present value of benefits . and although alternative designs can sometimes provide somewhat greater utility than a tontine , the retirement income tontine has the advantage of transparency , simplicity and requiring little if any actuarial expertise to operate .",

    "assume condition , which we may restate as @xmath431 condition involves a general collection of subscribers , which we will take to consist of @xmath432 individuals from the @xmath45th group , @xmath433 . stated in this way",
    "it becomes that @xmath434 for every choice of @xmath432 ( other than @xmath435 and @xmath436 ) .",
    "observe that the left hand side of is a concave function of each @xmath437 ( when the others are fixed ) , while the right hand side varies in an affine way .",
    "observe also that is precisely for the extreme points of @xmath438\\times\\cdots\\times[0,n_k]$ ] other than @xmath435 and @xmath436 .",
    "it is easily verified that the same inequality holds at the last two points as well , but with @xmath439 rather than @xmath440 .",
    "this is enough to conclude that the strict inequality holds at all points of @xmath441 other than @xmath435 and @xmath442 , so lemma [ individualexistence ] applies to give an equitable @xmath252 .",
    "motivated by the proof of theorem [ thm : existence ] , we calculate equitable participation rates by successively raising those @xmath51 for which @xmath79 .",
    "we choose a relaxation rate @xmath443 , and cycle through the @xmath45 , raising @xmath51 by @xmath289 as often as possible while preserving the above criterion .",
    "then repeat the process this time raising by @xmath444 , then repeat again raising by @xmath445 , etc . for @xmath165",
    "this appears to converge to 5 digits accuracy , using fewer than 100 evaluations of the vector @xmath446 .",
    "each equitable @xmath447 entry of table [ table04 ] took approximately 4 hours running under r , and involved 100 evaluations of the vector @xmath446 .",
    "each evaluation required computing two integrals , using simpson s rule with 400 time steps .",
    "each time step in turn called for a binomial sum of @xmath448 terms . with @xmath92",
    "the computations are faster ( 25 integrations , with each time step calling for summing @xmath449 terms ) ; for example the equitable @xmath450 entries in table [ table03 ] each ran in just over 3 hours , despite accounting for an order of magnitude more people .",
    "note that our code could easily be optimized to run faster , eg . by using a more efficient integration method , or by starting with coarser time steps and refining them as the iteration proceeds .",
    "for utility computations , we do seem to need the level of accuracy provided by 400 time steps , but the @xmath72 s are less sensitive and could have been found quicker .",
    "let @xmath451 denote the utility an individual derives from a paf .",
    "scale invariance shows that @xmath184 for some function @xmath289 .",

    "@xmath29 , stamos ( 2008 ) derives an hjb equation for an individual s utility @xmath451 .",
    "the same argument applies when @xmath31 and shows ( in our notation ) that @xmath453-(r+\\lambda_{x+t})v(t , k , w ) + \\\\ + \\sup_\\eta \\big[\\log(\\eta w)+wv_w(t , k , w)(r-\\eta)\\big]=0\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath454 ( with a similar equation when @xmath455 , except without the second term .",
    "optimizing over @xmath289 , and substituting our expression for @xmath456 gives that @xmath457 .",
    "therefore @xmath458 , which is independent of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore @xmath459 evolves according to the differential equation @xmath460\\overline{w}_t\\,dt.\\ ] ] it is easily checked that the solution ( with initial condition @xmath461 ) is @xmath462 , from which we conclude that @xmath463 , as required ."
