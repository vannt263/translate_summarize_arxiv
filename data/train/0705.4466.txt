    "the damage spreading method has been widely used to study the critical properties of ising - like systems @xcite as well as to spin glass @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the synchronous monte carlo update of two distinct spin configurations that are evolving from an almost identical initial state @xcite .",
    "since the ising model lacks of an intrinsic dynamic , it has to be chosen a particular one . among others ,",
    "the more frequently used are glauber and heat - bath dynamics .",
    "in contrast to usual statistical monte carlo studies , damage spreading results depends on the used dynamic @xcite . this behavior has been used to evaluate the dynamical exponent @xmath10 of the 2d and 3d ising models with different dynamics @xcite .",
    "also , very recently , it has been shown that damage spreading is a powerful and useful technique for the numerical study of the role of the interfaces between magnetic domains on the propagation of perturbations in magnetic materials @xcite . within this context",
    ", we have reported that the presence of interfaces act as a  catalyst  of the damage in at least two different ways : speeding up the propagation and causing an enhancement of the total damaged area @xcite .",
    "the basic idea for the implementation of the damage spreading method @xcite is to start from an equilibrium configuration of the system at temperature @xmath5 , which is generically called @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , a very small perturbation is applied to that configuration in order to obtain a new one , i.e. the so called perturbed configuration @xmath12 .",
    "usually the perturbed configuration is obtained by flipping a small number of spins of the unperturbed configuration",
    ". then one has to study the time evolution of the perturbation in order to investigate under which conditions such a small perturbation will grow up indefinitely or eventually ( hopefully ) it will vanish and become healed . in order to follow the time evolution of the perturbation",
    "an useful method is to measure the `` hamming distance '' or damage between the unperturbed and the perturbed configurations .",
    "the total damage @xmath13 is defined as the fraction of spins with different orientations , that is    @xmath14\\right| , \\label{eq : dam}\\ ] ]    where the summation runs over the total number of spins n and the index @xmath15 is the label that identifies the spins of the configurations .",
    "starting from a vanishing small perturbation @xmath16 one can expects at least two scenarios , namely : a ) @xmath17 and the perturbation is irrelevant because it become healed and b ) @xmath18 goes to some well defined finite value . in the latter , frequently",
    "undesired case , the perturbation is relevant because it can not be healed out . for further details",
    "see the review @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is propose and study a model for damage spreading with damage healing , which is based in the two dimensional ( @xmath19 ) ising model .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath19 ising magnet undergoes a second - order order - disorder transition when the temperature is raised from a relatively low initial value .",
    "the location of the critical point is know exactly and it is given by the so called onsager critical temperature @xmath20 .",
    "according to previous studies of damage spreading using glauber dynamics it is known that there is a critical damage temperature given by @xmath21 @xcite , such as for @xmath22 the damage spreads out over the whole sample while for @xmath23 the damage becomes healed after some finite time .",
    "consequently , the proposed model , that incorporates a healing probability , is suitable for the study of damage spreading above @xmath24 , as well as to gain insight on the robustness of the damage behavior in the ising model .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii we propose the model and describe the numerical procedure for the simulation of damage spreading .",
    "section iii is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results , while our conclusions are stated in section iv .",
    "the model is based on the @xmath19 ferromagnetic ising model , which for a square lattice of side @xmath25 can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the spin variable , corresponding to the site of coordinates ( i , j ) , that may assume two different values , namely @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the coupling constant of the ferromagnet and the summation of ( [ eq : ham ] ) runs over all the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins .    for the purpose of the simulations ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are always used .",
    "furthermore , we have used the glauber dynamics . in order to implement this dynamic",
    "a randomly selected spin is flipped with probability @xmath31 given by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the difference between the energy of the would - be new configuration and the old configuration , and @xmath34 is the usual boltzmann factor .",
    "the temperature is measured in units of the onsager critical temperature of the @xmath19 ising model .    in order to study",
    "the time evolution of the damage spreading a meaningful definition of the monte carlo time step ( mcs ) is necessary . for this purpose the standard definition",
    "is adopted according to that during one mcs all @xmath35 spins of the sample are flipped once , in the average .    for the practical implementation of equation ( [ eq : dam ] ) , first an equilibrium configuration ( say configuration @xmath36 ) is generated . for this purpose one",
    "starts from an initial configuration with all @xmath37 spins oriented at random .",
    "the application of the glauber dynamics leads to the desired equilibrium configuration after @xmath38mcs .",
    "subsequently , a fully damaged replica @xmath39 of such configuration is created , such as @xmath39 is the mirror image of @xmath36 and consequently @xmath40 . of course ,",
    "due to the spin flip symmetry , the replica configuration is also equilibrated .    in standard damage spreading studies",
    ", the standard monte carlo procedure is then applied to both configurations , where the same sites are randomly selected and the same random numbers are used in both systems in order to perform the updates . for the purpose of the proposed model we first define the healing probability @xmath41 and we used the same method but according the following rules :    \\i ) a sample site of coordinates @xmath42 is selected at random .",
    "then ,    iia ) if @xmath43 , which means that the selected site is not damaged , the glauber dynamics is followed according to the standard procedure @xcite .",
    "however ,    iib ) if @xmath44 , i.e. for a damaged site , a new random number @xmath45 is generated and one proceeds as follows :    iib1 ) if @xmath46 , the damage is healed , so that one sets @xmath47 .",
    "however ,    iib2 . if @xmath48 , the standard dynamics is applied .",
    "according to the defined rules and taking @xmath49 , one has that for @xmath50 , the damage would become healed for all temperatures , while in the limit @xmath1 , the usual damage spreading dynamics in the ising model is recovered .    using the above described procedure , we have followed the time evolution of the damage @xmath51 , which is evaluated according to equation ( [ eq : dam ] ) , for different values of @xmath3 , @xmath52 and the lattice size @xmath53 .",
    "simulations are stopped when the damage is healed , otherwise they are performed up to @xmath54 mcs .",
    "figure 1 shows log - log plots of @xmath51 versus @xmath55 obtained at @xmath56 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that : i ) for @xmath57 the damage becomes healed for finite times and the log - log plots of @xmath51 versus @xmath55 exhibit a downward curvature .",
    "ii ) for @xmath58 the damage quickly propagates and the log - log plots of @xmath51 versus @xmath55 show that the damage reaches a stationary value . finally , just at @xmath59 the damage decays according to a power law .",
    "so , the change of the curvature of the plots shown in figure 1 allows us to identify the critical probability @xmath60 for damage spreading .",
    "the straight line observed in figure 1 for @xmath60 suggests a power - law behavior given by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is an exponent .",
    "the best fit of the data gives @xmath63 .",
    "similar plots obtained for @xmath64 ( not shown here for the sake of space ) exhibit the same behavior as that observed in figure 1 and the typical slope , averaged within the range @xmath65 , is given by @xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath67 figure 1 shows a fast decay of the damage .",
    "as suggested by the study of spreading behavior @xcite , we proposed an exponential decay given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the characteristic time of decay .    in order to check the scaling ansatz given by equation ( [ expodeca ] ) ,",
    "figure 2 shows log - lineal plots of @xmath51 versus @xmath55 obtained for @xmath67 .",
    "the obtained straight lines for the long time behavior allow us to evaluate the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that @xmath69 increases when approaching the critical probability .",
    "furthermore , plots performed at different temperatures ( no shown here for the sake of space ) also exhibit the same behavior , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "again , using the spreading formalism @xcite , the following power - law can be proposed    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the correlation length exponent for damage propagation along the time direction .",
    "figure 3 shows log - log plots of @xmath69 versus @xmath8 obtained at different temperatures .",
    "the typical averaged value resulting from the fits is given by @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our estimations for the exponents , given by @xmath73 and @xmath72 are in agreement with the well known critical exponents of the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) , namely @xmath74 @xcite and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "so , these results strongly suggest that the the proposed model of damage spreading with damage healing belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "this statement is further supported by the fact that the limit @xmath1 corresponds to the well known ising model where the damage spreading transition is known to lie within the dp universality class @xcite .    on the other hand , as follows from figure 1 , for @xmath76 and after a short decay period ( @xmath77 mcs ) , the damage becomes stabilized ( or saturated ) with typical average values @xmath78 that depend on @xmath3 .",
    "this trend has been checked by means of extensive simulations run up to @xmath79 mcs .",
    "furthermore , we have also checked that the stationary values of @xmath78 exhibit negligible finite - size effects for @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath81 in a lineal - lineal plot .",
    "it follows that @xmath78 increases lineally as a function of @xmath81 , and that the slope @xmath82 depends on temperature .",
    "this assumption is valid only in the limit of @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , we propose    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is almost a constant independent of @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) . the slope of the lines can be obtained by fitting the data of figure [ fig4 ] and it is found that @xmath82 also depends lineally with @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) according to    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are also constants .",
    "so , by inserting equation ( [ fdet ] ) into equation ( [ dsat ] ) , one obtains    @xmath89    that gives the full dependence of @xmath78 on both @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the scaling plot suggested by equation ( [ dsatscal ] ) holds acceptably as shown in figure [ fig6 ] .    performing plots of the time evolution of the damage using different values of @xmath3 ( as shown in figure [ fig1 ] ) and changing @xmath5 ,",
    "it is finally possible to evaluate the phase diagram of the model , i.e. a plot of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "it is found that @xmath92 for very large values of @xmath5 , as expected from the definition of the model .",
    "for the asymptotic decay of @xmath90 we propose    @xmath93    where the best fit of the data , within the range @xmath94 , gives @xmath95 for the exponent of equation ( [ fasedia ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for the lattices used in the simulations , the phase diagram exhibits negligible deviations due to finite size effects , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] . on the other hand , close to @xmath96 , it is observed that @xmath90 reaches a maximum value of the order of @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "we have carefully checked that this behavior , which remains to be understood , is not due to the operation of finite size effects .",
    "finally , let us remark that all phase transitions at the critical curve at the border between damage healing and damage spreading , shown in figure [ fig7 ] , belong to the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "based on the fact that in the 2d ising model the damage is not healed above the critical temperature , we proposed a model that introduces a healing probability .",
    "it is found that for @xmath64 the damage becomes healed for critical values of @xmath3 .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is obtained and it is shown that the transitions between states of damage spreading and healing belong to the universality class of directed percolation in @xmath99dimensions .",
    "our results thus support the conjecture that damage spreading transitions are generically in the universality class of directed percolation @xcite , provided the fact that such transitions do not coincide with the critical point of the undamaged system ."
