    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are thought to be important baryonic contributor to the universe ( see @xcite for a review ) . the initial study by @xcite , based on spiral galaxies , found that the central surface brightness of disk galaxies was concentrated on a very narrow range .",
    "subsequently , @xcite pointed out the surface brightness resulted from @xcite may be due to the selection effect and predicted the existence of galaxies fainter than sky background .",
    "indeed , many surveys later have discovered a large number of lsbgs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they span a very wide range in morphology ( ranging from dwarfs and irregulars to giant disk galaxies ) , stellar mass and colors ( 0.3 @xmath6 b - v @xmath6 1.7 ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . considering their metal content ,",
    "most lsbgs present low metallicity ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , although the metallicities of some red lsbgs have been found to be around the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "star formation plays a crucial role in the evolution of lsbgs .",
    "usually , star formation in galaxies could be divided into four different kinds of mode : ( 1 ) instantaneous star formation , typically in interaction / merging event , ( 2 ) normal star formation with relatively higher star formation rate ( sfr ; about 1@xmath45 m@xmath5/yr ) , typically in normal spiral galaxies under gravitational wave density , ( 3 ) continuous star formation under very low sfr in long time - scale , typically in dwarf galaxies @xcite and ( 4 ) episodic(sporadic ) star formation , star formation do not need to be a continuous process under small fluctuation , typically in lsbgs @xcite .",
    "lsbgs are found to have relatively low sfrs , probably an order of magnitude lower than hsbgs @xcite .",
    "previous studies showed that the evolution of lsbgs was much slower than that of their high surface brightness counterparts ( hsbgs ) , and most of their stellar mass was formed by the third star formation mode .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the weak bursts / interaction may still occur in lsbgs in the recent 5 gyrs .",
    "@xcite found that the lsbgs may experience episodic star formation activities along hubble time due to gas infalling .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite both found the star formation mechanism in their sample appeared to be the same as those of hsbgs , and the total stellar mass formation in lsbgs were close to a hubble time , alternatively , it was a normal star formation mode .",
    "all of these results reveal that the star formation activities in lsbgs are still controversial .",

    "kkr 17 has one bright , compact knot , and one extended , faint diffuse region .",
    "this galaxy was firstly discovered by the second palomar sky survey ( poss - slowromancap2@ ) films @xcite , and its redshift was confirmed to be 0.0276 @xcite .",
    "in addition , its hslowromancap1@ flux was measured by using the 100-m radio telescope at effelsberg @xcite .",
    "the arecibo alfalfa survey showed its gas mass was quite high .",
    "based on literature available , kkr 17 is still poorly studied and could be an ideal laboratory to test some of the star formation models .    in this paper , we explored the global properties of kkr 17 , using the multi - wavelength observations from ultraviolet ( uv ) to near - infrared ( nir ) , and mainly focusing on the star formation and stellar population .",
    "the observations and relevant data reduction are presented in 2 .",
    "the main results of our analysis are presented in 3 .",
    "discussions and summary are presented in 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we used the archived far - uv ( fuv ) , near - uv ( nuv ) images from _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) , optical wide - band images ( @xmath19 ) from _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) , mid - infrared 3.4  images from _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) and hi data from _ arecibo legacy fast alfa survey _ ( alfalfa ) .",
    "in addition , we have obtained optical narrow - band images and spectra of kkr 17 by using bao faint object spectrograph and camera ( bfosc ) mounted on 2.16 m telescope at xinglong observatory , national astronomical observatories of chinese academy of science ( naoc ) .",
    "detailed information is given in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the galex mission was launched in 2003 , and it has surveyed all sky simultaneously in two broad - bands . the effective wavelength of fuv instrument is 1516 , and nuv is 2267  @xcite . the field of view ( fov ) of galex is @xmath41.2@xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the optical broadband images ( @xmath19 ) were taken from sdss data archive server @xcite .",
    "the background was subtracted from each image before photometry , and the counts were converted to flux densities and magnitudes .    the new images with narrow - band filters ( centered at redshifted h@xmath0 and [ oslowromancap3@ ] , respectively ) and broad - band filters ( v- and r - bands ) were observed with bfosc on 2.16 m telescope at xinglong observatory , naoc on june 16 2012 .",

    "fortunately , the doublet [ nslowromancap2@ ] lines were very weak in the low metallicity environment , which could contaminate @xmath45% fluxes at most to our narrow - band image and is much less the flux calibration error .",
    "therefore , we neglected the [ nslowromancap2@ ] emission lines in kkr 17 in our analysis .",
    "all standard ccd reductions were performed before astrometric and flux calibrations .",
    "the sdss field stars were used as references for astrometric and flux calibration , and the astrometric calibration accuracy is better than 1  in our images .",

    "we obtained the semi - axis ratio of b / a = 0.92 , the inclination angle of 34.90 degree and the disk scale length of @xmath50 = 7.52 arcsec .",
    "the galactic scale length is equivalent to the linear scale length of 4.20 kpc at this redshift , which was comparable to nearby giant lsbg malin 1 @xcite .",

    "the surface brightness profile of kkr 17 in the @xmath12-band was shown in figure  [ fig : sb ] and the color of @xmath51 was @xmath4 0.15 mag .",
    "the best - fitted single exponential profile indicated that kkr 17 was a bulgeless galaxy .    in order to obtain the central surface brightness , we converted the sdss magnitude to johnson b - band magnitude ( lupton 2005 ) .",

    "the color of a galaxy could reveal its star formation history ( sfh ) , since the older stellar population would have the redder color , and the younger stellar population would have a bluer color .",
    "previous study found the ages of blue lsbgs span a wide range , from young ( 2 gyr ) @xcite to old ( @xmath4 7 gyr ) @xcite , which depends on the physical conditions both in the disk and sfr @xcite .",
    "one of the explanations for these blue lsbgs was that they may be formed by the episodic star formation process ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the episodic star formation process means the stars could form through a discrete process in small perturbation .",
    "the star formation process could carry out both active and quiescent periods in the galaxy and last in a few gyrs .",
    "the global stellar population was contributed by the low sfr , and the bright hslowromancap2@ region was formed by the episodic star formation process .",
    "kkr 17 is classified as very blue lsbg , based on the definition of @xcite ( u - b and b - v colors of kkr 17 were 0.25 and 0.27 , respectively ) .",
    "it had a significant bright hslowromancap2@ region but a faint , diffuse region , which would be a perfect testbed for the theoretical models of lsbgs .",

    "we compared the seds of kkr 17 with the different morphological templates to reveal the stellar population .",
    "we adopted the sed templates of elliptical , late - type spiral galaxies , and low dust extinction starburst galaxies ( reddening e(b - v ) @xmath6 0.1 ) from @xcite , and also took one spectrum of typical low surface brightness galaxy ugca357 @xcite .",
    "we normalized all fluxes of templates and kkr 17 in the central wavelength of i - band filter , which can avoid the strong emission of [ oslowromancap3@ ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the total continuum of kkr 17 seemed to be flatter compared to the ones of late - types and starbursts , and also revealed a hybrid stellar population , which could be the population combination of the spiral sc galaxies and ellipticals .",
    "the hslowromancap2@ knot was a typical young - star - dominated region . however , the stellar populations of diffuse region was quite different from that of hslowromancap2@ knot .",
    "the diffuse region showed a flux jump between nuv and fuv , which is a typical spectral feature for a - type stars @xcite .",
    "thus the diffuse region may be dominated by a - type stars .",

    "we considered both the cases with and without emission lines subtracted .",
    "the integrated ( @xmath53 ) , ( @xmath51 ) colors of entire kkr 17 and diffuse region correspond to ages of @xmath4 600 myr .",
    "in addition , the hslowromancap2@ region is much younger than diffuse region , and the intergrated colors revealed that the age of stellar population of this region was @xmath440 myr .",

    "the flux over the wavelength range of hslowromancap2@ in both sed and stellar synthesis model was similar to the ones of ob stars clusters , which to some extent means the hslowromancap2@ region was undergoing star formation .",
    "however , the existence of large fraction of medium age ( @xmath4 600 myr ) stars in diffuse region may also be seen as the hint of different star formation histories in two regions .",

    "the mass - to - light ratio relation and single near - infrared luminosity can be used as useful estimators for the stellar masses .",
    "all the methods of constraining the stellar mass of galaxies suffers from a uncertainty of a factor of two because of large uncertainty in the contribution fraction by the thermally pulsing asymptotic branch ( tp - agb ) stars in the stellar evolution model .",

    "the value of the mass - to - light ratio properly falls within the reasonable range of imf . @xcite and @xcite derived the m / l , and studied the stellar mass function by combining the near - infrared and optical photometries in normal - galaxies - dominated sample . @xcite suggested the b - band stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m / l@xmath54 ) was around 1.4 for lsbgs . under this assumption ,",
    "the stellar mass was estimated based on the b - band absolute magnitude in @xcite , and the obtained stellar mass for kkr 17 is 1.32 @xmath17 10@xmath27 m@xmath5 by using m / l@xmath54 .    *",

    "the derived stellar mass of kkr 17 with the relation above was 1.22 @xmath17 10@xmath27 m@xmath5 , which is close to previous method .",
    "as we can see , both results showed that the stellar mass of the galaxy was more than 2 times lower than its mass of neutral hydrogen , which indicates that kkr 17 is dominated by neutral hydrogen .",
    "the gas fraction and gas ratio of kkr 17 are @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively , which is a factor of 2 below the average gas fraction ( @xmath62 ) in 40% arecibo alfalfa total sample @xcite .    *",
    "monochromatic 3.4  luminosity : * the monochromatic 3.4  luminosity is a convenient way to estimate stellar mass since it has a less dependence on star formation history and massive stars .",
    "previous studied have found the 3.4 @xmath8 m luminosity could be a stellar mass tracer of galaxies @xcite , and we then used the following conversion method : @xmath63 the stellar mass of kkr 17 was 3.77 @xmath17 10@xmath64 m@xmath5 , which only one - third of the stellar mass derived from the m@xmath54/l .",
    "the stellar masses derived from the optical and near - infrared luminosity are quite different .",

    "the ssfr value is slightly higher to the one for the typical e / s0 galaxies inferred for ir - selected sample  @xcite .",

    "the flux coming from the hslowromancap2@ region takes roughly 43% of total h@xmath0 flux in the h@xmath0 narrow - band image , which was consistent with the results of @xcite .",

    "the total h@xmath0 luminosity of this hslowromancap2@ region was approximately to @xmath70 l(hslowromancap2@ ) = 40.06 erg / s , within the radius of @xmath4 1 kpc .",
    "if the luminosity of a single o7v star in a hslowromancap2@ region is @xmath70 l(hslowromancap2@ ) = 37.0 @xcite , then thousands of o stars may exist in the hslowromancap2@ region , and they contributed @xmath4 50% to h@xmath0 luminosity in kkr 17 , which is consistent with the previous results  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the emission lines of hslowromancap2@ region in kkr 17 showed the star formation processes may be complicated .",

    "the components showed a small velocity difference of @xmath460 km / s identified by [ oslowromancap3@ ] emission lines , and @xmath490 km / s by h@xmath49 emission line . also , the metallicities were slightly different in terms of @xmath75 index , which can be easily obtained as a rough metallicity estimator but with relative large uncertainty .",

    "in contrast , it is noted that the systematic uncertainty is larger , 0.5 dex .",
    "the small differences in the velocity and metallicity of hslowromancap2@ components can be attributed to the internal episodic star formation activities .",
    "in fact , the young stellar clusters ( yscs ) , often found in hsbgs , can generate shocks , which can be used to explain those differences @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the star formation processes in lsbgs are the same as the one in hsbgs .",
    "in addition , the recent research on yscs in hsbgs found that yscs are readily formed in a cluster complex than in an isolated environment @xcite .",
    "the strong stellar wind from clustering massive stars could lead to those differences in yscs .",
    "the shock - accelerated superwind was detected by nearby galaxies m82 and ngc839 @xcite .",
    "however , this was not supported by our spectra , we did not detect any line as the strong shock tracer , i.e. , the [ sii ] lines was weak and the [ nslowromancap2@ ] lines was an upper limit detection .",
    "another explanation is that each component had different origins .",
    "it was possible that the bright hslowromancap2@ region was a dwarf galaxy fell into kkr 17 from a minor merger .",
    "the blue color of hslowromancap2@ region , @xmath78 , is similar to the one for a irregular galaxy @xcite , and its absolute magnitude ( m@xmath79 @xmath4 -15 ) resided at the faint end of luminosity function for the local extreme low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "moreover , the unusual colors of b - v = 0.27 and u - b = 0.21 might also imply the existence of an infalling dwarf galaxy in kkr 17 . the firm conclusion may still need a higher spatial resolution study for yscs in kkr 17 , e.g. , the future ifu spectroscopy .",
    "the lsbgs are usually thought to be evolving slowly across the hubble time compared with their high surface brightness counterparts .",
    "the slow evolution may be connected with the small gas surface density@xcite .",
    "if a lsbgs is lack of neighbors over small and intermediate space scales , the absence of gravitational interaction will be able to keep the gas in a stable situation@xcite .",
    "also the other possibilities for the slow evolution of lsbgs could be due to the large dark matter halo , or low metallicity and dust content , or different imf@xcite .    the blue , gas - rich irregular galaxies , kkr 17 , is located in local void in hercules - aquila direction .",
    "theoretically , it may be far away from interaction in a long time scale , which leads to a low star formation rate .",
    "the previous studies on the sfh of izw 18 showed that the continuously long - time low star formation activity can build up the stellar mass of galaxy @xcite . although the slow star formation process can not be confirmed , we found that the kkr 17 experienced a short - duration star formation roughly 600 myr ago .",
    "@xcite pointed out the lsbgs were fast evolving in recent @xmath41 gyr .",
    "their results are in favor of the episodic star formation scenario @xcite .",
    "the medium - age stellar population of diffuse region in kkr 17 may be dominant by a - type stars , which is consistent with the @xcite s result .    except the star formation process occurred 600 myr ago",
    ", the bright hslowromancap2@ region is currently undergoing the strong star formation in kkr 17 .",
    "the strong emission line features of hslowromancap2@ region indicated the existence of a large fraction of o stars .",
    "the luminosity of hslowromancap2@ region ( l(h@xmath0 ) @xmath80 10@xmath71 erg / s ) was unusually high to a lsbg @xcite .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the star formation in such complicated ysc could be triggered by an external perturbation .",
    "if the perturbation was from an nearby galaxy , we should find the evidence in observations .",
    "however , we do nt found any objects from our fuv - to - nir images .",
    "it is an isolated galaxy without any obvious large galaxies within a angular radius of 8 , which is equivalent to @xmath4250 kpc at its redshift .",
    "based on the discussion above , the multiple components of h@xmath49 and [ oslowromancap3@ ] emission lines may be a clue for the minor merger remnant , or the hslowromancap2@ region was a dwarf galaxy , as discussed in section  4.1 , and experienced a minor merger .",
    "the deep interferometric imaging to kkr 17 with high spatial resolution and velocity dispersion may clean up the confusion , revealing its real star formation activity .",
