    "the importance of topology in different aspects of condensed matter physics has long been known , from topological excitations @xcite through topological order @xcite to topological quantum computing @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the most surprising roles of topology however was the discovery of topological insulators ( tis ) about a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the central idea is that gapped states of non - interacting electrons can be characterised by a topological index @xcite . the original topological index for the integer quantum hall states , the tknn index @xcite has now been extended to all possible dimensions and underlying symmetries of the system in question , leading to a ` periodic table ' of possible topological insulators @xcite .",
    "while the value of the appropriate topological index is a technical way of defining a topological insulator , the defining feature is the presence of edge states ",
    "gapless excitations that live only at the edge of the sample , while the bulk of the system remains gapped .",
    "these edge states also have the feature that they can not be localised by disorder .",
    "they remain conducting  perfectly so in two - dimensional topological states  no matter how rough or disordered the edge is so long as none of the protecting symmetries are broken .",
    "specialising now to two dimensional systems with time reversal symmetry , we have the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect which has a @xmath0 topological index .",
    "typically , this state appears in semiconductors which have band inversion due to strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the inverted band may be viewed as a negative band gap , and the defining topological index can be reduced to the sign of the gap  a positive gap means a normal insulator , while a negative gap is the topological state .",
    "this leads immediately to one of the main questions discussed in this work : _ can one obtain states akin to a topological insulator when the gap is not present in the band structure , but dynamically generated by interactions ? _",
    "it is worthwhile noting that topological superconductors @xcite are one example of such a mechanism occurring  after a mean field decoupling , these reduce to a non - interacting hamiltonian and a classification as before @xcite .",
    "we will discuss other examples which have no local symmetry breaking and no local order parameter , and so they can not be so obviously put into the existing framework .",
    "the role of interactions in topological insulators is currently a vibrant field .",
    "one of the questions often asked is how interactions affect the metallic states at the edge of the topological insulator ",
    "it is well understood now @xcite that interactions destroy the perfect conduction predicted by the non - interacting theory due to inelastic scattering processes . for weak to moderate interactions , this gives a temperature dependent reduction to the conductance , the perfect conductance still being realised at zero temperature .",
    "for strong interactions however , the topological protection may be broken completely , and the edge state may localise . the second question we will be concentrating on in this work is the opposite of this : _ can interactions enhance the topological protection of the state , i.e. make it less sensitive to impurities ? _",
    "we will discuss two models that have recently been proposed that show emergent topological properties as discussed above .",
    "the first is a model of a single ( spinful ) channel quantum wire with ising anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the second is two coupled quantum spin hall helical edge states @xcite . in this case , it is important to note that the @xmath0 topological classification of the quantum spin hall effect means that an even number of coupled edge states ( i.e. two ) are not topologically protected ( in the absence of interactions ) .",
    "the common feature of these two models is that they are each interacting one - dimensional systems with two channels  in the former case , these two channels are the two spin projections ; in the latter , the two distinct helical edge states . the low - energy effective hamiltonian is thus equivalent in both cases .",
    "when the interactions are treated @xcite , the channels rearrange themselves into two independent propagating collective modes  one carrying charge , and the other carrying the remaining degree of freedom ( spin in the former case , relative distribution of charge in the latter ) .",
    "we will describe the conditions under which this charge mode remains gapless , but the other mode acquires a gap . in line with our previous discussion , we will see in both cases that this gap can have two possible signs  one of which is topological and exhibits edge states .",
    "the system is however not an insulator , as there are gapless modes in the charge sector throughout the entire one - dimensional bulk .",
    "the metallic charge sector does not escape the influence of topology however  we show that due to the gap in the spin sector , the charge sector is robust ( or even topologically protected ) against backscattering from impurities in the same way as a single ( topologically protected ) helical edge in the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "this is in strong contrast to conventional wisdom of impurities in a one - dimensional luttinger liquid , whereby the states are localised for all but the strongest attractive interactions @xcite , while even a single impurity drives the conduction to zero for repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the emergent topology therefore manifests itself in two ways  firstly in the presence of edge states in the spin / relative charge sector , and secondly in the protection against backscattering of the gapless charge modes .",
    "we will show at the end that these two properties are related , in that one implies the other .",
    "we will also discuss how to potentially classify the emergent topological phase , which although inspired from the ideas of topological insulators can not be manifestly written as a non - interacting theory .",
    "depicted as a dotted line belongs to the tll phase .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram],scaledwidth=37.0% ]    the first system we want to discuss is a single channel quantum wire .",
    "it is thereby important that the spin - rotation invariance of the electrons in the wire is broken , such that the low energy model of the system contains ising ( easy - axis ) anisotropy in the spin degrees of freedom ; the reason will become clear shortly .",
    "we begin by introducing the low energy model that describes the electrons in the wire .",

    "but since the topological properties are solely determined by the spin sector , the results hold also for the corresponding superconducting phases .",
    "a subtle point , that is often overlooked in the literature is , that the topological sdw phase can only be realized in systems with broken spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "technically , the su(2 ) symmetry in the spin sector manifests itself by the condition that the coupling constants , @xmath45 , are equal and thus the system is either in the tll phase if @xmath46 or in the cdw phase if @xmath47 .",

    "the second system where we see the appearance of emergent topological properties are the edge states of the qsh insulator .",
