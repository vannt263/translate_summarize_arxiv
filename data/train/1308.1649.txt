    "experimental and theoretical study of the photo - nuclear production of strangeness has been performed extensively on the proton but most recently the focus has shifted to the neutron , in order to fully idealize a universal description of the process for all six isospin channels .",
    "a lone neutron target is unrealistic , thus the use of a deuteron as a quasi - free neutron target is the most practical option . at present , there has been experimental investigation of the elementary kaon photoproduction process on a proton target via the @xmath9 reactions that have measured cross sections and some polarization observables at jlab ( clas )  @xcite , spring-8 ( leps )  @xcite , elsa ( saphir )  @xcite , graal  @xcite and mami  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a few collaborations such as those at elsa and mainz  @xcite have used liquid deuterium targets in experiments and have measured neutral kaons in the @xmath10 reactions . prior to the decommissioning in 1999 ,",
    "the saphir group reported on the total and differential cross sections as well as hyperon polarizations in the aforementioned reactions .",
    "their results confirmed that the cross section quickly climbs at 1.1 gev , plateaus and then declines at photon energies close to 1.45 gev .",
    "the published results in 2004 by saphir  @xcite for @xmath11 , were consistent with the previous saphir data  @xcite .",
    "they concluded the presence of sizable resonance contributions to the production of @xmath2 at threshold energies and also for ( @xmath12 ) at approximately 1.45 gev .",
    "additionally , they reported that hyperons , ( @xmath13 ) , were intensively polarized and produced with opposite signs  @xcite . at the time of publication , the clas collaboration contributed the largest data set for these reactions at photon energies of 1.6@xmath142.53 gev and angles of @xmath15 @xmath16 cos@xmath17",
    "@xmath16 0.95 . despite the substantial experimental data sets that have been measured for the @xmath11 reaction with clas and saphir  @xcite they are still not adequate to constrain theoretical models and successfully",
    "predict the cross section of the unmeasured channels , further motivating this study .",
    "the aim of this experiment was placed on neutral particle ( @xmath18 and @xmath2 ) final states at threshold energies .",
    "the production of @xmath2 may occur through two channels , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our experiment was conducted near the production threshold and therefore , it acknowledges that the reaction is significantly less perturbed by higher nucleon resonances , allowing for a simplification in the description of the process and permitting the investigation with less uncertainty .",
    "the first preliminary results on the energy dependence of the integrated cross section for forward angles and the momentum dependent differential cross sections was previously reported  @xcite .",
    "our experimental and analysis method was centered on the angular dependence of @xmath2 photoproduction at photon beam energies ranging from @xmath21 gev , providing an original measurement and a means to augment the current understanding of neutral kaon production .",
    "theoretically , descriptions of the reaction have used different approaches that included the use of various form - factors , as well as nucleon and hyperon resonances .",
    "the data provided here seeks to be used for constructing a credible model with a reduction in the number of uncertain free parameters , while also being capable of extracting information regarding the excitation spectrum .",
    "previous exploration of the @xmath22 and @xmath0h@xmath23p processes measured by the neutral kaon spectrometer ( nks ) and nks2 experimental collaborations yielded encouraging results  @xcite .",
    "the first measured the neutral channel and demonstrated the importance of the @xmath24 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the second reported the first measurement of neutral kaon photo - production on a neutron  @xcite .",
    "as an outcome of the nks experiments , the re - envisioned neutral kaon spectrometer ( nks2 ) was newly designed and constructed at lns in 2004 , replacing the original version .",
    "its main purpose was to investigate the photoproduction process , particularly the production of neutral strange particles via single @xmath25 and @xmath2 observation with an acceptance less biased in the forward region compared with the nks spectrometer .",
    "the results influenced an extension of the proposed measurable physical observables , which directly propelled advances in the spectrometer design .",
    "the nks2 has since then undergone an additional upgrade in order to improve the spectrometers acceptance , chiefly in the forward hemisphere .",
    "the most recent has been the redesign of the inner detector package , by installing an inner hodoscope ( ih ) and a vertex drift chamber ( vdc ) and being renamed as the nks2 + .",
    "a photon beam was generated from a carbon wire radiator ( @xmath26 m ) and was guided through a collimator in order to reduce the beam halo , a sweep magnet , and into the nks2 + , where it was directed to the target located at the center . moving from the inner most position outwards , was the target , which was surrounded by a vertex drift chamber ( vdc ) , and an inner hodoscope , comprised of twenty plastic scintillator segments ( ih ) , which acted as the start signal for time of flight measurements .",
    "these detectors were fully enclosed in a cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) .",
    "all detectors were located between the poles of a dipole magnet with a 680 mm aperture and a 80 cm diameter .",
    "the typical magnetic field was 0.42 tesla at the center position .",
    "the target was inserted from top side of the magnet yoke with the cryostat also located on the top of the yoke .",
    "the target cell shape was cylindrical ( 30 mm length and 50 mm @xmath27 ) .",
    "the cell window , 40 mm @xmath27 in thickness , was made from a polymide film .",
    "the target system , adapted for the nks2 + , was able to control the liquefaction of deuterium and sustain it in a liquid phase . during the experiment , the temperature and pressure of liquid deuterium and the residual gas were monitored and recorded to estimate the density .",
    "the average density of the deuterium target was estimated at 0.172 g/@xmath28 with minor ambiguities .",
    "this corresponded to an approximated average number of deuteron targets of 0.168 @xmath29 .",

    "there was additional experimental time scheduled , but that was unfortunately postponed due to significant damage at elph attributed the tohoku - pacific ocean earthquake of 2011/march/11 .",
    "the energy of the photon beam , created via bremsstrahlung , was determined by measuring the scattered electrons from a carbon wire , by the photon tagging system .",
    "the accepted number of events and photons were 0.64 @xmath31 10@xmath32 and 0.89 @xmath3110@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the main trigger a required coincidence signal between the photon tagging counter ( tagger ) , a two - hit minimum requirement on the ih and oh , along with an absence of a signal from the upstream electron veto ( ev ) . a triggered event ensured that the event originated from a real photon and also that the decay particles passed through the length of the ih , drift chambers ( vdc @xmath34 cdc ) and exited the spectrometer via the oh . we employed only the upstream side of ev in the trigger ; the downstream side was not included in order to avoid the introduction of a bias in the data set .",
    "the following section details the particle identification and event selection used in the analysis .",
    "the normal tagged photon beam rate was about 2 mhz with a trigger rate of roughly 2 khz and a 65% daq efficiency .",
    "the momenta of the detected particles were determined by the cdc and the species was identified by tof measurements , with the ih and oh providing the start and stop timing signals respectively .",
    "the typical tof resolution was about 400 ps , which was more than adequate to successfully separate pions and protons at momenta less than 800 mev / c illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_squared ] . the direct approach to measuring the photoproduction of strangeness is by reconstructing the invariant mass of the produced particles that contain a hyper charge .",
    "a two particle track reconstruction strategy was used in the track analysis of the cdc , which achieved a position resolution between 300 - 400 @xmath35 m over its ten layers .",
    "a selection requirement was placed on the opening angle between reconstructed particle tracks equivalent to @xmath36 @xmath16 cos@xmath37 @xmath16 0.9 in order to reduce the @xmath38 background in the data set .",

    "consequently , a selection outside the target was specified to reject particles originating from the principal reaction vertex .          various cuts , but not limited to , timing , @xmath41 and kinematical requirements were applied to the raw invariant mass to extract a clear @xmath2 peak from the continuum , shown in fig .

    "the spread in the missing mass spectrum distribution is associated with the fermi motion within the deuteron .",
    "the generated missing mass was derived from an inclusive measurement of p@xmath46 , therefore , the distribution has contributions from the @xmath47 and @xmath48 processes .",

    "the differential cross section for the inclusive measurement of @xmath4 can be calculated from experimentally measured variables as : @xmath55    where @xmath56 was the yield of @xmath4 events , @xmath57 was the number of incident photons on the target , and @xmath58 was the number of target neutrons .",

    "the efficiency of the number of hits required to reconstruct a track(@xmath66 ) , was calculated as 98.3% @xmath42 2% .",
    "the uncertainty of the number of photons irradiated on the target which was proportional to the number of recorded scalar hits in tagf ( n@xmath67 ) was straightforwardly found as the square root of the counts @xmath68 .",

    "the disparity in the contribution of each process arises from the resonance content of each model s approach to born term suppression .",
    "sla incorporates hyperon resonances to assist in curbing of large non - physical born term contributions , while the km model only relies on nucleon resonances . in the @xmath72 channel ,",
    "the importance of the @xmath73 parameter is remarkably dissimilar for both models .",
    "previous calculations of the momentum integrated angular cross sections for the sla(r@xmath7 = @xmath74 ) were reported but were based on fits to published nks2 data that was later amended  @xcite , resulting in a newly acquired parameter of sla(r@xmath75 = @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ratio of the photo coupling constants in the @xmath76-channel for the neutral and charged channels are related to the helicity amplitudes , such that @xmath77 transition moments correspond to decay widths of the meson , where quark model calculations assist in restricting the values of the k@xmath78(829 ) meson .",

    "the @xmath73 parameter in the km framework was determined by fitting @xmath80 data .",

    "the spread in the obtained background values for the all approximated approaches was used a good measure of the uncertainty and was considered to contribute to the lion s share of systematic error in the calculated cross section .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties were introduced by the kinematical cuts , in the determination of the number of target deuterons , and incident photons .",
