    ", sgr b2 exhibits the largest submillimeter continuum flux of any astronomical source outside the solar system .",
    "the molecular inventory of the gas in sgr b2 has been extensively studied by means of ground - based radio observations ( e.g.  cummins , thaddeus & linke 1986 ; turner 1989 , 1991 ; sutton et al .  1991 ; nummelin et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",

    "1997 ) and the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ; see neufeld et al .",
    "2000 ) have facilitated the observation of water vapor in sgr b2 .",
    "water is of particular interest because of its central role in the chemistry of interstellar oxygen and its potential importance as a coolant of molecular clouds ( see , for example , neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ; melnick et al .",
    "2000 ; bergin et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in a earlier study of sgr b2",
    ", we used swas to obtain the first high - spectral - resolution ( @xmath9 ) observations of h@xmath4o toward that source . in a previous paper ( neufeld et al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter n00 ) , we reported the detection of water absorption over a wide range of lsr velocities that can be attributed to water vapor in foreground clouds that are not associated with sgr b2 .",
    "we have since extended these observations to map ( incompletely ) a region of size @xmath10 around sgr b2 . in the present paper , we describe these new mapping observations and discuss the abundance of water vapor in the vicinity of sgr b2 itself .",
    "our mapping observations of sagittarius b2 were carried out during the period 1999 march 20 through 2000 september 16 .",
    "they yielded incomplete coverage of a region extending @xmath11 north , south and east and @xmath12 west of sagittarius b2 . in table 1",
    "we list the on - source integration times for each of 19 positions observed , together with the offsets relative to the core of sgr b2 at position @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( j2000 ) . at 550 ghz the swas beam size is @xmath15 and the main beam efficiency is 0.9 ( melnick et al .",
    "all the data were acquired in standard nodded observations ( melnick et al .",
    "2000 ) and were reduced using the standard swas pipeline .",
    "the reference ( nod ) position was located at @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( j2000 ) in a region of devoid of strong co emissionco j=10 was less than 0.5 k at all velocities ] .",
    "the total on - source integration time for these mapping observations was 90.4 hours .    because swas employs double - sideband receivers , the @xmath18co  @xmath19 transition at 550.927 ghz and the h@xmath3o @xmath0 transition at 556.936  ghz are observed simultaneously in the lower and upper sidebands of one receiver ( receiver 2 ) . for the mapping observations , the swas local oscillator ( lo ) setting was chosen to separate the @xmath18co emission from sgr b2 ( at @xmath20 ) from any h@xmath3o emission or absorption at lsr velocities @xmath21 .",
    "for the ( 0,0 ) position , several additional lo settings had previously been used ( see n00 ) to allow the region @xmath22 to be covered as well without contamination by @xmath18co emission from the lower sideband .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the nineteen h@xmath3o spectra obtained from our mapping observations described above . each panel shows a spectrum covering the range @xmath23 .",
    "the vertical dotted line denotes @xmath20 , the systemic velocity of sgr b2 .",
    "the upper horizontal dotted lines indicate the continuum flux level , determined from the spectral regions @xmath24 to @xmath25 and 125 to 145@xmath26 that are devoid of absorbing gas , and the lower horizontal dotted lines indicate the zero flux level , estimated by the method described in  4.1 below . on each panel a pair of numbers , x / y , describe respectively the continuum antenna temperature ( which corresponds to the separation between the two dotted horizontal lines ) , and the antenna temperature ( in k ) at the top of the panel .",
    "the former is also given in table 1 .",
    "the feature at @xmath27 to @xmath28 is a @xmath18co emission feature detected in the lower sideband . in figure 2 , we show the receiver 2 data reduced as appropriate for the @xmath18co line in the lower sideband ; a strong feature at @xmath29 is observed at several positions close to sgr b2 .",
    "we note that the spectra in figure 2 are not perfect mirror images of those shown in figure 1 ; in particular , the @xmath18co features are significantly narrower in the spectra that were reduced as appropriate for the lower sideband ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the swas lo setting is fixed in the rest frame of the spacecraft , which has a motion relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) that varies quite rapidly . in particular , the spacecraft orbits the earth every 97 minutes with an orbital speed of @xmath30 ( and  of course  the earth also orbits the sun . ) in the standard swas pipeline , the necessary doppler corrections are applied to every 2 seconds worth of data , and the sign of the correction is _ opposite _ for the lower and upper sidebands .",
    "thus any spectral line originating in the lower sideband will be smeared out as it appears in figure 1 , while any line from the upper sideband will appear broadened in figure 2 .    although not the primary emphasis of this paper , for completeness we present additional spectra obtained for the @xmath31 fine structure line of atomic carbon .",
    "these spectra , shown in figure 3 , are obtained from receiver 1 ( upper sideband ) on the swas instrument , which performs simultaneous observations of the ci @xmath31 line in a linear polarization orthogonal to that observed with receiver 2 .",
    "there is no evidence for emission or absorption by the 487.249 @xmath32 transition of o@xmath3 , to which receiver 1 is sensitive in its lower sideband .",
    "even a cursory inspection of figure 1 reveals three significant features in the water spectra : ( 1 ) extended absorption , observed at almost every one of the 19 positions , covering the range @xmath33 ; ( 2 ) extended emission , again observed at almost every position , covering the range @xmath34 ; ( 3 ) less - extended absorption , only observed unequivocally at the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 positions , centered at v@xmath40 , the systemic velocity of the sgr b2 cloud .",

    "can be attributed to material lying at a wide range of locations along the line - of - sight between the solar circle and sgr b2 .",
    "the mapping observations presented in figure 1 show clear evidence for absorption at @xmath46 at 18 of the 19 positions observed , implying that both the continuum emission and intervening material have a large angular extent .",
    "the angular extent of the absorbing water vapor at @xmath45 is considerably larger than that of the water vapor at @xmath47 , the systemic velocity of sgr b2 .",
    "the large spatial extent of the water absorption at @xmath46 is further demonstrated by the swas spectrum of water vapor toward sgr a , shown in figure 4 , which clearly exhibits strong absorption in this velocity range .",
    "located at position @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( j2000 ) , sgra is at offset ( 21.8@xmath50 , 37.4@xmath50 ) relative to sgr b2 .",
    "thus the swas observations of the galactic center region show water absorption at @xmath46 covering a region of longest angular dimension 50 arcmin , corresponding to a linear scale of 125 pc for an assumed distance to the galactic center of 8.5 kpc . of course , if the absorbing material lies significantly closer to us than the galactic center , then its linear extent could be smaller than 125 pc .",
    "the presence of strong absorption at @xmath45 allows us to estimate the continuum flux level , a quantity that is not reliably determined by the swas instrument . in particular , the zero flux level in figure 1 and table 1 is established on the assumption that the spectral region @xmath51 5 to 5@xmath26 is subject to complete absorption by water vapor in foreground material along the line - of - sight to sgr b2 .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the facts that ( 1 ) absorption at @xmath52 is observed at almost every position and is well separated from contamination from @xmath18co emission in the lower sideband ; and ( 2 ) the h@xmath44o spectrum of the @xmath53 line at the ( 0.0@xmath50,0.0@xmath50 ) position ( see n00 ; also figure 7 ) implies an optical depth @xmath54 at @xmath45 , corresponding to an h@xmath4o @xmath53 optical depth of several hundred . if the @xmath55 5 to 5@xmath26 spectral region is not subject to complete absorption , then the continuum antenna temperatures quoted are lower limits .",
    "the continuum antenna temperatures obtained by this method can be compared with continuum maps presented by dowell et al .",

    "we have compared these values with those expected for optically - thin dust with an opacity that varies as @xmath57 .",
    "the ratios observed toward the central nine positions are all consistent with dust temperatures of 15  k and above ; the larger values of the 540 @xmath56 m / 350 @xmath56 m flux ratio observed at greater distances from the cloud center suggest that the dust temperature is smaller in the outer parts of the sgr b2 cloud .",

    "the likely presence of continuum emission that is not covered by a significant water column density has implications for the h@xmath44o abundance obtained above . for the water - covered component , the effective line - center to continuum ratio decreases from 0.49 to @xmath103 , and the implied ortho - h@xmath44o abundance increases by a factor of almost @xmath104 from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",

    "we took as adjustable parameters the following : ( 1 ) the fraction , @xmath120 , of the continuum emission covered by the 60.4 and @xmath117 clouds and @xmath117 clouds were paired in this manner  with a common assumed covering factor  and the 66.7 and @xmath119 clouds likewise paired , because the h95 observations suggest that the former pair cover sgr b2(m ) but not sgr b2(n ) , and the latter pair cover sgr b2(n ) but not sgr b2(m ) ] ; ( 2 ) the fraction @xmath121 , of the continuum emission covered by the 66.7 and @xmath119 clouds ; ( 3 ) the strength of the 80  120@xmath122 emission feature at the @xmath81 position in sgr b2 ( with an assumed line centroid and width as derived from the average spectrum shown in figure 5 and discussed in  4.2 ) ; ( 4 ) the h@xmath44o line center optical depths in each of the four absorption components . following c02 ,",
    "the absorption was considered to occur in a  foreground screen \" .    as in  4.3.1 , we assumed an h@xmath4o / h@xmath44o abundance ratio of 250 , and a water ortho - to - para ratio of 3 . in the upper panel of figure 7 ,",
    "the red curve shows our best fit to the h@xmath4o absorption using this model .",
    "because the h@xmath4o lines have optical depths of several hundred and therefore lie on the flattest part of the curve - of - growth , the h@xmath4o spectrum is almost entirely insensitive to the assumed optical depth ; it therefore provides a relatively unambiguous determination of the covering factors @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the red curve represents our best fit to the h@xmath4o spectrum , obtained for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and with a 80  @xmath125 emission feature of peak antenna temperature 0.2  k.    once the covering factors have been determined from the h@xmath4o spectrum , the line - center optical depths can be determined from the h@xmath44o spectrum .",
    "the red curve in the lower panel of figure 7 represents our best fit to the data , obtained with line - center optical depth of 1.3 , 1.0 , 0.8 , and 1.5 respectively for the @xmath116 , 66.7 , 69.0 , and @xmath119 features .",
    "iso observations of the @xmath126 transition of h@xmath4o at 108.073 @xmath56 m yield a further observational constraint upon the material responsible for the water absorption .",
    "a long - wavelength spectrometer fabry - perot spectrum of the source ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2003 ) yields an absorption line equivalent width @xmath127 . using a simple excitation model to estimate the fractional populations of the h@xmath4o rotational states",
    ", we find the observed 108 @xmath56 m equivalent width to be consistent with the best - fit optical depths and covering factors derived from the swas observations ( table 3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the 108 @xmath56 m line lies on the flat part of the curve - of - growth , so the observed equivalent width does not place strong constraints upon the physical conditions in the absorbing material .",
    "the absorbing column densities implied by the h@xmath44o line - center depths are inversely proportional to the difference @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the fraction of ortho - water molecules in the 1@xmath130 rotational state and @xmath131 is the fraction in 1@xmath132 . thus the minimum column density of h@xmath44o is obtained for the assumption @xmath133 , @xmath134 ; these minimum values are tabulated in table 3 . the beam - averaged , minimum total column density  weighted by the continuum antenna temperature  is @xmath135 , a value in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath136 derived previously for the minimum h@xmath44o column density from kao observations by z95 .",
    "the actual column density is larger by a factor @xmath137 .",
    "we have used a statistical equilibrium model for the h@xmath44o level populations to estimate the correction factor @xmath137 . in figure 9 , we plot the values of @xmath129 , @xmath131 and their difference @xmath128 as a function of the radiation field . here",
    "we follow c02 in assuming that the far - infrared continuum radiation originates in a region of radius @xmath138 = 0.8 pc , and determine the h@xmath44o level populations as a function of the  dilution factor \" , @xmath139 .",
    "the spectral shape of the far - infrared continuum source was obtained from pipeline-10 archived iso lws grating spectra and re - processed using the iso spectroscopic analysis package version 2.1 .",
    "the dilution factor is defined such that the solid angle subtended by the far - infrared continuum source is @xmath140 at the location of the absorbing water vapor .",
    "it is related to the distance , @xmath141 , from the center of sgr b2 ( top horizontal axis in figure 9 ) by the expression @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "solid curves in figure 9 show results for the temperature and density favored by c02 for the absorbing material : an h@xmath3 density of @xmath143 and a gas temperature of 700  k. dotted curves show the results obtained for the same assumed temperature but with the density increased by a factor of 10 .",
    "two features of figure 9 are noteworthy .",
    "first , the level populations are not greatly affected by a factor 10 increase in the assumed density .",
    "this behavior is explained by the fact that the gas density is very much smaller than the  critical density \" for the @xmath53 transition ; the excitation of this transition is therefore controlled by the radiation field .",
    "second , the quantity @xmath128 is close to unity unless the absorbing material is located very close to the center of the sgr b2 core . for the distance of 1.15  pc favored by c02 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath144 , the value of @xmath128 is 0.8 and the correction factor @xmath137 is only 1.25 .",
    "significantly smaller values of the distance of the absorbing material from the cloud core are ruled out by the requirement that the absorbing water vapor must lie in front of most of the emitting dust .",
    "we conservatively adopt an upper limit of 1.5 for the correction factor @xmath137 .    using the analysis method of  4.3.2 , where the water absorption is assumed to arise in a foreground cloud of warm , low - density material ,",
    "our estimate of the beam - averaged h@xmath44o column density lies in the range @xmath145 . given by c02 for @xmath146 but agrees with that obtained by comito et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . ]",
    "given an assumed abundance ratio of 250 for h@xmath4o / h@xmath44o , the h@xmath44o column density we derived implies an h@xmath4o column density of @xmath147 .",
    "the total h@xmath3 column density of the warm absorbing gas layer is not well constrained by observations ; if we adopt the estimate of @xmath148 given by flower et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , then the water abundance is a few @xmath2 .    as noted by flower et al.(1995 )  and contrary to the assertion of c02 that there is no discrepancy  the observed water column density lies an order of magnitude below the predictions of shock models for the warm , absorbing gas layer in front of sgr b2 .",
    "recent observations of high oh abundances in sgr b2 ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ) may provide an explanation of the discrepancy between theory and observation . as suggested by goicoechea & cernicharo ,",
    "if the shocked gas is irradiated by strong ultraviolet radiation from a population of hot stars , then photodissociation will reduce the h@xmath3o abundance and increase the oh abundance .",
    "further chemical modeling is needed , however , to determine whether this explanation is either quantitatively plausible or consistent with the large observed abundance of nh@xmath111 in the absorbing gas .",

    "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    in  4.3.1 and  4.3.2 above , we have used two alternative methods to analyse the swas observations of h@xmath4o and h@xmath44o at the @xmath81 position in sgr b2 .",
    "although the first method  in which the water vapor and dust are assumed to be well mixed in the cloud core  yields a fit to the data which is inferior to that of the second method  in which the water vapor is assumed to lie in a foreground gas cloud  the poorer fit can be ascribed to the fact that the assumed velocity structure was far simpler in the first analysis method . on the basis of the swas data alone , therefore , we do not find compelling evidence to favor one picture over the other.o .",
    "they conclude that a significant fraction of the water absorption must take place within warm foreground material . ]    in principle , both the cold core and a warm intervening cloud might contribute to the observed water absorption .",
    "insofar as the water column densities involved add linearly , we may conclude that @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the water column density in the warm foreground material and @xmath151 is the water abundance relative to h@xmath3 in the core .",
