    "the evolution of cooperation is still a major open problem in biological and social sciences @xcite .",
    "after all , why should self - interested individuals incur costs to provide benefits to others ?",
    "this puzzle has been traditionally studied by means of evolutionary game theory , and with remarkable success @xcite .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game @xcite , for example , is the classical setup of a social dilemma .",
    "the population is best off if everybody would cooperate , but the individual does best if it defects , and that regardless of what other choose to do . in classical game theory ,",
    "the nash equilibrium of the prisoner s dilemma game , indeed the rational choice , is thus to defect .",
    "nevertheless , cooperation flourishes in nature , and it is in fact much more common as could be anticipated based on the fundamental darwinian premise that only the fittest survive .",
    "humans , birds , ants , bees , and even different species between one another , all cooperate to a more or less great extent @xcite .",
    "an important step forward in understanding the evolution of cooperation theoretically was to consider spatially structured populations , modeled for example by a square lattice , which has been done first by nowak and may @xcite who discovered network reciprocity .",
    "in spatially structured populations cooperators may survive because of the formation of compact clusters , where in the interior they are protected against the invasion of defectors .",
    "other prominent mechanisms that support the evolution of cooperation include kin selection @xcite , mobility and dilution @xcite , direct and indirect reciprocity @xcite , network reciprocity @xcite , group selection @xcite , and population heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "in particular , research in the realm of statistical physics has shown that properties of the interaction network can have far reaching consequences for the outcome of evolutionary social dilemmas @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) , and moreover , that heterogeneity in general , be it introduced in the form of heterogeneous interaction networks , noisy disturbances to payoffs , or other player - specific properties like the teaching activity or the propensity to acquire new links over time , is a strong facilitator of cooperation @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of a structured population is not always favorable for the evolution of cooperation . if the interaction network links three individuals into a triangle , it may be challenging , or even impossible , to come up with a distribution of strategies that ensures everybody is best off ( even if one assumes away the constrains of the evolutionary competition ) @xcite . in the snowdrift game , anti - coordination of the two competing strategies",
    "is needed for an optimal outcome of the game .",
    "clearly , in a triangle , if one individual cooperates and the other defects , the third player is frustrated because it is impossible to choose a strategy that would work best with both its neighbors .",
    "similarly frustrated setups occur in traditional statistical physics , and have in fact been studied frequently in solid - state physics @xcite . in anti - ferromagnetic systems , for example , spins seek the opposite state of their neighbors , and again , it is clearly impossible to achieve this in a triangle . as noted above , the snowdrift game is in this regard conceptually identical , and thus one can draw on methods of statistical physics and on the knowledge from related systems in solid - state physics to successfully study the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in settings that constitute a social dilemma .    the manifestation of topological frustration in the snowdrift game , however , can depend strongly on how the players update their strategies during the evolutionary process . in the light of recent human experiments",
    "@xcite , we here consider not only the generally used imitation dynamics , but also the so - called logit rule ( also known as myopic dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "the latter can be considered as more innovative , allowing players to choose strategies that are not within their neighborhood if they provide a good response to the strategies of their neighbors .",
    "although the long term evolution in animals is best described by imitation dynamics , humans tend to be more inventive , and thus their behavior aptly described also by innovative dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the impact of the logit rule and of closely related strategy updating protocols on the outcomes of evolutionary games on the square lattice has been studied extensively @xcite , but there the topological frustration is absent .    in what follows ,",
    "we fill this gap by studying the snowdrift game on the triangular lattice , as well as the transition from the square to the triangular lattice , both by means of mean - field approximations and monte carlo simulations .",
    "our main objective is to reveal how an inherent topological frustration affects the evolutionary outcomes .",
    "we observe fascinating honeycomb - like patterns , and we devise an elegant method to determine the level of frustration in an arbitrary interaction network through the stationary level of cooperation . before presenting the main results , we first describe the mathematical model , and we conclude with a discussion of the wider implications of our findings .",
    "in our model , players have only two possible strategies , namely cooperation ( c ) and defection ( d ) , and the game is played in a pairwise manner as defined by the interaction network . during each",
    "pairwise interaction players receive a payoff according to the payoff matrix @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this parametrization is useful as it spans four different classes of games , namely the prisoner s dilemma game ( pd ) , the snowdrift game ( sd ) , the stag - hunt game ( sh ) , and the harmony game ( hg ) @xcite .",
    "after players collect their payoff , they may change their strategies based on a particular strategy updating rule . in this paper",
    ", we consider the logit rule and compare it with the classical imitation rule .",
    "the logit rule is based on the kinetic ising model of magnetism ( also known as glauber dynamics @xcite ) .",
    "the site will change its strategy with probability @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the site current payoff , @xmath7 is the site s payoff if it changed to the opposite strategy , and the states of neighborhood remain unchanged . finally @xmath8 is a parameter that measures the irrationality of players . in the literature @xmath8 is usually set between @xmath9 $ ] to simulate a small , but non - zero , chance of making mistakes @xcite , we set it to be @xmath10 .",
    "mathematically , the model is equivalent to the statistics used in physics to describe the dynamics of spins in a fermi - dirac distribution and is widely used in evolutionary dynamics @xcite . in the context of game theory , this kind of update rule ( also know as myopic best response @xcite )",
    "is regarded as a player asking himself what would be the benefits of changing his strategy ( even when there is no neighbor with different strategy ) .",
    "this means that the logit rule is an innovative dynamic , since new strategies can spontaneously appear .",
    "recently , the logit rule has been the focus of many works @xcite as it leads to very different results compared to imitation models . as we see , this rule is closely related to rational analysis of a situation , instead of the reproduction of the `` fittest '' behavior .",
    "although evolutionary game theory has its bases rooted in biological populations dynamics , recent works shows that the modeling of humans playing games can have more in common with innovative dynamics @xcite .",
    "the imitation rule , or imitation dynamics , is one of the most common update rules in iterated evolutionary game theory @xcite , and is based on the concept of the fittest strategy reproducing to neighboring sites . here",
    "we will use it as a baseline for comparison with our results .",
    "site @xmath11 will update its state by randomly choosing one of its neighbors , @xmath12 , and then comparing their payoff .",
    "site @xmath11 adopts the strategy of @xmath12 with probability @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total payoff of site @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that player @xmath11 can only change its strategy to the ones available in its neighborhood .",
    "this means that new strategies can never appear once extinguished and players never `` explore '' new strategies , which can be interpreted as a non - innovative dynamic .",
    "this model is associated with biological processes , where each strategy is regarded as a specie , and once extinguished it will never re - appear @xcite .",
    "we note that this is not always the case when modeling human interactions , who can change behaviors depending also on other external , and to a large degree unpredictable , factors .",
    "we also note that many works have shown that the strategy updating rule can have profound influence on the evolution of strategies , even changing the impact of the topology of interaction network @xcite .",
    "we make a quick review here to clarify some properties of the triangular lattice .",
    "this topology has an important property : every closed loop is comprised of an even number of steps , which gives rise to frustration phenomena @xcite .",
    "the snowdrift game , which is also known as anti - coordination game since choosing the opposite strategy of the partner is a nash - equilibrium , is strongly affected by network inherent frustration . in square lattices , the logit rule yields a population displaying a very stable checkerboard pattern , as everyone can choose to do the opposite of all neighbors @xcite . in contrast , this spatial ordering is impossible in the triangular lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern ] .",
    "every pair of different strategies will share at least one third neighbor that will be frustrated .",
    "this phenomenon is well explored in magnetic models , where many interesting `` spin - glass '' phenomena can arise @xcite . in spin models we see that the `` minimum energy '' configuration would be similar to the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern ] .",
    "we wish to analyze this situation in evolutionary game dynamics .",
    "one type of player is surrounded by a honeycomb structure of the opposite type , repeated infinitely for a large lattice .",
    "notice that the central site ( blue ) does not have any frustrated connections , while the other type ( red ) is frustrated in half of its connections .",
    "we start showing that , mathematically , the formal relation between anti - coordination games and anti - ferromagnetic systems @xcite is not an identity .",
    "let us consider a matrix for the energy of a single spin in a magnet with coupling constant @xmath16 and an external magnetic field @xmath17 , similar to the payoff matrix  [ paymatrix ] : @xmath18 the spins in the anti - ferromagnet ( @xmath19 ) tend to point in the opposite direction as their neighbors , as in anti - coordination games individuals tend to do the opposite of their neighbors .",
    "however , equating the payoff matrix to the energy matrix ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) and requiring the snowdrift payoff condition ( @xmath24 ) yield @xmath25 which is a mathematical absurd .",
    "there is no combination of parameters that obey both the physical symmetry of magnetic system and the dilemma hierarchy of game theory for a general case . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic system obeys a diagonal symmetry in the matrix , whereas the game theory obeys a linear hierarchy of the parameters in the matrix , both can not be fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "it is important to stress that , although we will see many phenomena in the simulations that are analogous to anti - ferromagnetism , the systems are not formally identical .",
    "let us analyze the logit model using mean - field approximation at nearest - neighbor level @xcite . for simplicity we set @xmath26 in this section .",
    "if @xmath27 , we have the so - called weak prisoner s dilemma .",
    "consider a central site @xmath11 on a lattice .",
    "it interacts only with its four ( square lattice ) or six ( triangular lattice ) nearest neighbors ( @xmath28 neighborhood ) . in this setup ,",
    "we present the master equation for the average fraction of cooperators , @xmath29 ( note that @xmath29 is a function of @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability for the central player to change its strategy to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 different neighborhood configurations where @xmath36 is @xmath37 for the square lattice and @xmath38 for the triangular lattice and @xmath39 is the number of cooperative neighbors for each neighborhood configuration . therefore : @xmath40    here",
    ", @xmath35 are the binomial coefficients and weights the repetitions of identical configurations .",
    "note that while @xmath39 varies in the summation , @xmath36 is fixed for each lattice type . the term @xmath41 weights the probability of such configuration and @xmath42 is the probability , in a specific configuration , that the central site will turn into a cooperator ( @xmath43 ) or a defector ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this probability is the only term that is directly dependent on the update rule chosen ( logit or imitation ) . for the logit rule the focal site changes the state comparing its current payoff ( @xmath6 ) with its future payoff if the state was changed , ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "calculating @xmath46 , for the case where the central site is @xmath34 and changes to @xmath33 , we have : @xmath47    analytically , one of the advantages of the logit model is that the probability does not depend explicitly on the payoffs of the neighborhood @xmath28 .",
    "if the central site is @xmath34 ( @xmath33 ) , the payoff difference , for any configuration , will be : @xmath48 using @xmath49 to simplify , we get : @xmath50    remember that the solution for the master equation of the imitation model can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the master equation for the logit model becomes : @xmath51    this yields a 6th order polynomial that analytically have at least one root in the region @xmath52 .",
    "this is independent of @xmath53 , meaning that at the nearest - neighbor level there exist at least some minimum cooperation level independently of the value of temptation .",
    "the existence of a minimum level of cooperation is an interesting result , agreeing with other approaches on innovative dynamics that found similar results using monte carlo simulations and experiments with humans @xcite .    to obtain the time - independent solution of the master equation we use a 4th order runge - kutta integrator . as in other models ,",
    "the system reaches a stable state after some time . in our model",
    "the behavior of @xmath54 is independent of the initial fraction of cooperation .",
    "this is an important feature , as not every update rule will have a equilibrium state independent of the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_isingnum ] shows the cooperation level for the stable equilibrium ( @xmath55 ) as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "we compare the monte carlo simulation ( further analyzed bellow ) with the numerical solution for the master equation in both topologies .",
    "the mean field approach agrees with the simulation results and , most importantly , both approaches report a basal cooperation level for any @xmath53 .",
    "the mean - field technique is a good approximation to obtain insights and confirm the prediction of other methods .",
    "even so , it does not always returns the same results as in the structured population @xcite , it is only an approximation . in our case , it is interesting to notice that both methodologies ( monte carlo and mean field ) report the minimal level of cooperation that is independent of the value of temptation .",
    "this kind of basal cooperation level was also found in other studies using innovative dynamics , even with different update rules and topologies @xcite .",
    "we use the asynchronous monte carlo procedure to simulate the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "first , a randomly chosen player , @xmath11 , is selected .",
    "the cumulative payoff of @xmath11 and of its nearest neighbors payoffs are calculated .",
    "then player @xmath11 changes its strategy based on the update probability defined in eq .",
    "[ isingeq ] for logit or in eq .",
    "[ imiteq ] for imitation dynamics .",
    "one monte carlo step ( @xmath56 ) consists of this process repeated @xmath57 times , where @xmath58 is the lattice linear size ( here we set @xmath59 ) . for a detailed discussion on monte carlo methods in evolutionary dynamics we suggest refs .",
    "we ran the algorithm until the equilibrium state ( @xmath60 @xmath56 s ) ; then we average over 1000 @xmath56 s for @xmath61 different initial conditions .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions and random , homogeneous initial strategy distribution .",
    "starting with the weak prisoner s dilemma ( @xmath26 ) , we compare the logit with the imitative dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig_comp2d ] shows @xmath29 as a function of @xmath53 . the logit model has a sharp decay in cooperation , almost at the same point where the imitation model has a transition @xcite",
    "this is valid for both square and triangular lattices . also , it is remarkable that for large @xmath53 a minimal global value of cooperation survives , confirming the prediction of our mean field approach .",
    "figure  [ fig_2x2phases ] shows the fraction of cooperation in the entire @xmath62 plane in the imitation and logit models , for both triangular and square lattices .",
    "notice how similar the outcomes are in the hg , pd and sh games .",
    "the difference appears in the snowdrift game .",
    "imitation dynamics yields similar results in both square and triangular lattices , but logit dynamics yields different results . more specifically , while in the logit model on the square lattice there is a flat plateau of @xmath63 cooperation ( deeply studied in @xcite ) , in the triangular lattice there are basically two phases separated by a straight diagonal line ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "notice that on the square lattice the whole sd region is associated with a static checkerboard pattern , corresponding to the nash equilibrium , which is the most efficient way of increasing the population payoff , as previously stressed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that for the logit model , cooperation survives independently of @xmath53 for some range of @xmath65 ( around @xmath66 ) in the pd region .",
    "studying the sd region for triangular lattice in the logit dynamics , we find a plateau of @xmath67 bellow the diagonal line and @xmath68 above it , with minor fluctuations of @xmath69 .",
    "we further refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for the analysis of the square lattice , where such plateau is also found with a single phase ( @xmath70 ) . in principle",
    ", there would be two `` ground states '' exhibiting a honeycomb pattern : a concatenation of cells with a central @xmath34 surrounded by @xmath33 s and a concatenation of cells with a central @xmath33 surrounded by @xmath34 s .",
    "let us consider the first `` ground state '' , where the central site in each cell of the honeycomb configuration is a defector surrounded by 6 cooperators .",
    "each one of these 6 cooperators is shared by 3 distinct cells .",
    "the fraction @xmath29 in an infinite lattice is calculated as the fraction of cooperators in the cell , weighting each site by the number of blocks which share it .",
    "so we have @xmath71 the calculation for the other `` ground state '' is analogous , yielding @xmath72 .",
    "most interestingly , the systems is driven to one of the two `` ground states '' configurations depending on the payoff parameters . to make this point clearer , in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagonal ] we show the fraction of cooperation for parameters along a straight line orthogonal to the line that divides the plateaus observed in the sd region .",
    "we can clearly see the two plateaus and the transition point where the roles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 players are exchanged , as shown in the incept of the patterns .",
    "the logit model seems to drive the system to the maximum attainable global payoff ( related to the minimum energy level ) . to further study this hypothesis",
    ", we quantify the frustration , @xmath73 , defined as the fraction of frustrated links . in sd games the frustrated links are the @xmath74 and @xmath75 pairs .",
    "note that our definition of frustration is a good measurement of the `` homogeneity '' and global spatial structure of the lattice : the frustration is @xmath76 for any homogeneous state , regardless of the cooperation level , and can be zero , for example , in the chess board pattern configuration of cooperators and defectors on square lattices . in both `` ground states '' configuration of the triangular lattice , we can easily show that the frustration is equal to @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_frustphase ] we compare the lattice frustration of logit and imitation rules for the sd region ( frustration is meaningless outside this parameter range ) .",
    "the imitation model maintains a high frustration , around @xmath78 , whereas the logit model maintains a moderate frustration , around @xmath79 , independently of payoff values of @xmath53 or @xmath65 , which is very close to the analytical solution of the honeycomb structure .",
    "note that on triangular lattices the minimum achievable frustration is @xmath77 , as there is an inevitable topological frustration .",
    "also note how frustration quickly rises to almost @xmath76 in the borders of the diagram , where there is full cooperation or full defection .    to further support our claims , we present snapshots of the lattices in dynamic equilibrium on the sd region .",
    "the monte carlo method is of course probabilistic , and accurate results are dependent on sufficiently large averages @xcite .",
    "even so , it is insightful to see the images of the lattice after the system has reached a dynamical equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ fig_2x2snapshot ] shows typical snapshots of logit and imitation update rules for square and triangular lattices .",
    "it is clear the differences in spatial organization exhibited in each model .",
    "we see that in both topologies the imitation update tends to maintain cooperators in clusters whereas the logit model tends to distribute strategies more homogeneously .",
    "specifically , the logit model on square lattice tends to form a checkerboard pattern , a behavior that has been consistently reported in different innovative rules @xcite and is usually attributed to the population re - arranging itself to receive the highest total payoff achievable . for the triangular lattice we can see that the expected frustrated pattern illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_pattern ] indeed emerges .",
    "it is worth mentioning that it is the absence of clustering that makes the mean - field approximation a good one for the logit dynamics .",
    "such phenomena suggests a general behavior exhibited by innovative dynamics that leads to the emergence of specific spatial structures , other than cooperation islands .",
    "we note that , while clustering has a strong effect on everyday cooperative interactions @xcite , the emergence of diluted patterns in our model suggests that some role - separating structure may also emerge in human population , where members have different roles to obtain a higher collective income .",
    "lastly , we analyze the representative microscopic mechanisms that explain how strategy evolution accommodates to topological frustration . in fig .",
    "[ fig_trimicro](a ) we present a local strategy distribution where the central site is highly unlikely to change its strategy that makes the honeycomb configuration very stable .",
    "conceptually similar stable local distribution can be drawn where a defector is surrounded by cooperators",
    ". however , the sites around the central stable site are not fully satisfied because they have some frustrated bonds .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_trimicro](b ) where a frustrated node is in the center . here",
    "the central site has a higher chance to change its strategy depending on the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the threshold value is at the line @xmath64 which agrees perfectly with the border line we observed in fig .  [ fig_2x2phases ] .",
    "the frustrated sites have a pivotal role in the separation of phases illustrated in fig .  [ fig_diagonal ] . for low @xmath53 values , that is for @xmath82 , cooperators fare better than defectors , allowing them to stay in `` frustrated '' sites of the honeycomb configuration .",
    "this results in a large number of cooperators , as every defector will be surrounded by 6 cooperators ( @xmath83 in the infinitely repeated limit ) .",
    "the opposite is also true for @xmath84 , namely , the defectors have a high payoff , allowing them to stay in the frustrated positions of the honeycomb patches . as a result",
    ", a stable cooperator will be surrounded by 6 defectors yielding a relatively low cooperation level ( @xmath85 in the infinite limit ) .",
    "we found that frustration can induce two distinct organized patterns on triangular lattices .",
    "as we noted , square lattice topology can be considered as the opposite extreme case where there is no frustrated bonds between players .",
    "we wonder how these extreme cases can be bridged by an appropriately modified topology where the frustration level can be tuned gradually .",
    "to generate such an intermediate level of inherent frustration we modify the triangular lattice by removing two diagonal connections of each site .",
    "when we alter the originally triangular lattice then the control parameter is the @xmath86 fraction of sites that have their diagonal links removed .",
    "accordingly , @xmath87 corresponds to the triangular lattice while at @xmath88 the resulting topology agrees with the square lattice .",
    "note that the network remains static throughout the evolutionary process and we study how the strategy evolution may change due to the intermediate level of topological frustration .",
    "figure  [ fig_topology ] shows the resulting cooperation level in dependence on the payoff values for differently frustrated topologies as characterized by the value of @xmath86 .",
    "as we start mitigating the maximal frustration by increasing @xmath86 , the steep transition point separating the two plateaus vanishes immediately verifying that the two ordered phases can only be observed when maximal level of frustration is present in the topology .",
    "as we increase @xmath86 further then the resulting @xmath89 function will approximate the @xmath70 plateau only at the @xmath90 limit .",
    "it simply means that the long - range anti - ferromagnetic order of competing strategies disappears immediately when we leave the @xmath88 point and introduce some frustration into the perfectly frustration - free square lattice topology . in between these extreme cases",
    "the shape of the @xmath91 function may inform us about the frustration level of the unknown interaction graph .",
    "in social interactions the `` best response '' is often challenging , especially if the interaction involves a triangle . in general , frustrated situations can arise as a consequence of the type of game played , due to specific interaction topologies , but also because of other external factors .",
    "motivated by this phenomenon , we considered the snowdrift game on a triangular lattice where the topological frustration inhibits the expected optimal anti - coordination of strategies . by means of master - equation approximations and monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have studied the logit strategy updating protocol , the classical imitation dynamics , and we have compared the evolutionary outcomes obtained on the triangular lattice , the square lattice , and on an abridged transition between the two that was achieved by randomly adding links to the next - nearest neighbors of the square lattice .",
    "our principal interest was to reveal how topological frustration influence the strategy ordering in a spatial system .",
    "in stark contrast to the square lattice where anti - coordination ordering can emerge , the frustrated topology of triangular lattice generates two ordered phases in the snowdrift quadrant .",
    "these states are separated by the @xmath64 line . while for low @xmath53 values cooperators occupy @xmath92 of the available sites and the rest is occupied by defectors , their roles are exchanged for high @xmath53 values . in both phases",
    "the system evolves into a state which is reminiscent to a honeycomb - like pattern that helps to minimize the negative consequence of the topological frustration .",
    "we have identified the microscopic mechanisms which compose these patterns , and we have found that such formations are very stable . by comparing them with the outcome of imitation dynamics , we have found that the logit rule allows the whole system to evolve into the least frustrated strategy distribution that is achievable on each lattice , which also provides the highest population payoff .",
    "this state is reached via a strategy distribution where cooperators are less clustered comparing to the patterns constructed by imitation dynamics .",
    "the striking difference between frustration - free ( square ) and frustrated ( triangle ) lattices raises a question on what we shall expect if the interaction graph is disordered and the level of topological frustration is unknown .",
    "what kind of behavior is expected in such a case ? to clarify this ,",
    "we have introduced a method which allowed us to modify the level of topological frustration gradually .",
    "starting from a triangular lattice , we have randomly deleted a fraction of diagonal links , which decreased the frustration between neighboring bonds .",
    "if all diagonal links were deleted , then we arrive at the square lattice .",
    "we found that the two ordered phases in the snowdrift quadrant disappear as we mitigate the frustration level . on the other hand , the well - known anti - ferromagnetic like checkerboard pattern observed on a square lattice , which is valid for the whole scan of the mentioned quadrant of the @xmath62 plane , evaporates immediately as we introduce a tiny frustration into the interaction topology .",
    "these phenomena highlight how frustration can drive individuals to form complex global patterns , and more importantly , how innovative dynamics can drive the system to the best , i.e. , least frustrated , evolutionary outcome .",
    "as the strategy updating rule can drastically alter population dynamics , it is important to study how different protocols deal with frustration and which kind of patterns can spontaneously emerge from the applied dynamic .",
    "this is even more interesting in the light of emergence of complexity as individuals interact .",
    "the studied logit rule model is essential to the emergence of the patterns shown here , and recent research shows the importance of integrating innovative dynamics in game theoretical models , especially since humans seem to use different rules than simply imitating the best when playing evolutionary games @xcite .",
