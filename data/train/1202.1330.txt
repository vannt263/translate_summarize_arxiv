    "the network approach has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure and properties of various complex systems ranging from transport networks to human society@xcite-@xcite . in view of the complexity of the dynamics in these systems ,",
    "considerable simplification is necessary in the numerical and analytical modeling .",
    "a typical example of the approach is the agent - based modeling of ( political or economical ) opinion networks@xcite .",
    "the process of opinion formation has been modeled as a collective dynamics in which the agents update their opinions by local majority or by imitation@xcite .",
    "the agents are located on the nodes of a graph and endowed with a finite number of discrete or continuously variable opinions ( e.g. , two opinions with spin up and spin down)@xcite-@xcite .",
    "both numerical and analytical results showed that the system could reach a total consensus or a state of coexistence of different opinions . in the case of continuous opinions ,",
    "the system can reach a state of polarization or fragmentation with a finite number of groups having different opinions@xcite-@xcite .",
    "interest has grown recently in a new type of network named adaptive network@xcite .",
    "they are characterized by the existence of the feedback loop between the opinion dynamics on the network and the structural dynamics of the network , meaning that the network evolves in time by rewiring the links due to the opinion change of the node , and by modifying opinion due to the topological structure evolution@xcite .",
    "it was observed in the numerical results that , in the case of continuous opinions , there was cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinions , while the adaptability of the topology structure favors the division of these clusters@xcite .",
    "the results obtained with these models are useful for understanding certain universal , global and statistical features of opinion systems .",
    "a possible improvement is to make the models closer to the reality by considering additional dynamical variables involved .",
    "for example , the different opinions are not only the attribute of the social agents , but also the elements of a network apart in which an opinion dynamics ( birth , death , union and division etc . ) can occur and influence the opinion adhesion of the social agents .",
    "similarly , the social agents composing the voter network have also its own dynamics ( rewiring , breaking , and addition of links , change of opinion etc ) which certainly affects the dynamics of the opinion subnetwork .",
    "the social agents are in addition elements of other networks ( cultural , economic , professional , environmental , ecological and so forth ) and constantly adapt their behavior and features to these `` environments '' .",
    "all these subnetworks form the global network of the society which is self - adaptive or self - referential through separate dynamics of the different self- or mutual - adaptive subnetworks .    based on this idea",
    ", we construct a dual model containing two interacting networks , one being composed of a large number of social agents , another one a small number of political parties or social opinions .",
    "the influence of the other social entities and networks such as economy , culture , international situations whose effect is in general a random factor for long term point of view , is simplified as a mean field or the `` temperature '' of a thermostat which can be controlled or changed randomly .",
    "this model is illustrated in figure 1 .",

    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "this dual model includes two subnetworks .",
    "the first one is the network of opinions or political parties .",
    "it initially contains a number @xmath0 of political parties randomly distributed on a one dimensional axis with discrete opinion position @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ( political spectrum ) in the interval from @xmath3 to @xmath0 .",
    "any two political parties , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , can have interaction or correlation such as communication , mutual support , exchange of viewpoints and members , mutual adaptation and so on .",
    "these interactions are simply modeled by a strength @xmath6 given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a parameter characterizing the interaction property .",
    "the distance @xmath9 will be divided by @xmath0 ( total number of parties or the length of @xmath10 axis ) to make the strength independent of the network size .",
    "the magnitude of the strength is evaluated with respect to the extreme left and the extreme right who do not have interaction due to the term @xmath11 .",
    "this is of course a simplified version of the reality ( to quantify the interaction strength ) since the extremists actually do have some relationships depending on their distance .",
    "the interaction may be affected by the social environment . since this environment is `` averaged '' with the temperature @xmath12 of the thermostat , we model its effect on each party @xmath4 in an average way with respect to the opinion mean @xmath13@xcite through an exponential factor in the interaction strength : @xmath14    this is an imitation of the temperature effect in the boltzmann distribution of equilibrium statistical mechanics , so that increasing temperature will enhance the interaction between this party and a given party @xmath5 . clearly , if @xmath15 at an `` equilibrium '' between the system and its environment , no external influence occurs . if @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) , the interaction is more strengthened for larger @xmath18 ( or smaller @xmath18 ) .",
    "put it differently , higher ( or lower ) temperature favors the interaction to the right ( or left ) .",
    "if the political spectrum was symmetrical , e.g. , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , the above effect to the right and left would be symmetrical .",
    "but in this work , taking into account the fact that the left and right wings are not symmetrical in general from political viewpoint , we keep the spectrum positive , i.e. , from 0 to 1 , so that @xmath16 and @xmath21 produce different effects on the left and right",
    ".    one of the essential properties of an opinion or political party is its attractivity .",
    "this property depends on many features such as viewpoint , political strategy or tactics , communication skills , eloquence of the representatives or speakers etc .",
    "this attractive character is represented in our model by the eloquence @xmath22 of a party @xmath4 whose values in the interval [ 1,10 ] are initially distributed randomly to the parties .    the age of an opinion or party is also an important phenomenological factor for its evolution . in this model ,",
    "each party increases its age by one at each step of the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "if two parties merge into one , both are considered dead with a newborn at the same time .",
    "if a party splits into two parties , it is considered dead accompanied by two newborns .",
    "the dynamics in the opinion subnetwork includes merging and splitting in the following way .    1",
    ".   two parties , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , can merge into a new one with a probability proportional to the interaction strength @xmath6 and to the sum of the numbers of their supporters @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the position of the new party is located at @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the eloquence of this new party takes the larger value of the two merged parties .",
    "the age @xmath26 of the newborn is 1 . 2 .",
    "a composite party @xmath27 ( composed of merged parties ) can split into two parties @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a probability given by @xmath28 , meaning that more aged party with larger number of supporters is more possible to split . while one of the party @xmath4 stays in the original position @xmath29 and",
    "keep the majority of the original agent number , the another one @xmath5 takes a new position @xmath30 .",
    "the distance @xmath31 is determined with a positioning probability proportional to the interaction strength @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 with the thermostat effect ) . concerning the number @xmath34 of agents belonging to this new party",
    ", we suppose that it takes @xmath35 of the agents belonging to each party @xmath36 with a probability @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 , where the eloquence of the newborn @xmath39 randomly takes a value between 1 and 10 .",
    "the two new born parties have the age of 1 .",
    "the second subnetwork containing @xmath40 social agents is initially a random graph with an average degree @xmath41 ( erdos - renyi network)@xcite .",
    "this subnetwork is in correlation with the subnetwork of parties through the opinion adhesion of the agents . at @xmath42 ,",
    "this adhesion is given by either a gaussian or a uniform distribution of agents over the political spectrum .    at each time step @xmath43 , with equal probability",
    ", the agent network evolves with three dynamics at the same time :    1 .",
    "an agent belonging to a party @xmath4 is randomly chosen and linked to another agent of a different party @xmath5 with a probability proportional to the interaction strength @xmath6 between the two parties and to the number of agents @xmath34 belonging to the party @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath44 . the first mechanism implies that the interaction between two parties can favor the contact between their supporters .",
    "the second one is a kind of preferential adhesion depending on the number of agent of the considered party .",
    "the link between a pair of randomly chosen agents belonging to different parties @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be broken with a probability inversely proportional to the interaction strength between their respective parties @xmath45 , meaning that the interaction between two parties can contribute to maintain the contact between their supporters .",
    "3 .   a randomly chosen agent can change his opinion ( political adhesion ) from the party @xmath4 to the party @xmath5 with probability given by @xmath46 , where @xmath39 is the eloquence of the party @xmath5 .",
    "this construction of adaptive agent subnetwork is based on the idea that each voter has the possibility to change his opinion under the influence of the opinion attractivity and of what the other agents are doing ( social validation@xcite ) .    when the effect of the thermostat is taken into account",
    ", the interaction strength should be replace by @xmath47 in the above dynamics .    in general ,",
    "the dynamics in the two subnetworks has different time rate or time scale .",
    "we use the time ratio @xmath48 to characterize the temporal difference , i.e. , one time step in the dynamics of opinion network corresponds to @xmath48 time steps in the social agent dynamics .",
    "in the simulation , the size @xmath40 of the agent subnetwork is a constant .",
    "the isolated agents and duplicate links are not allowed , and each agent can only adhere to one party at any time .",
    "the political spectrum is normalized ( devided by @xmath0 ) so that it is independent of the size of the opinion subnetwork .",
    "we used two initial distributions of agents over political spectrum : the normal and the uniform distribution ( figure 2 ) , for the same setting of parameters @xmath49 .",
    "it is observed ( figure 2 ) that the system evolves to a stable distribution of agents over parties with some peaks in the middle range of political spectrum , and this is independent of the initial distribution .",
    "this final normal - like distribution of agents can be explained by the dynamical rules .",
    "the interaction tends to unify the parties whose positions are close and to create new one situated between them .",
    "hence the parties in the middle range of the political spectrum have more chance to merge and to split with the newborns situated around them .",
    "as shown below , the number of the remaining parties decreases in the evolution due to the merging dynamics . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of agents of each party increases mainly in the middle range of the spectrum .    in order to see",
    "if this final state is in accordance with the reality , we carried out an empirical study of the distribution of voters over the different parties in the parliamentary elections mainly in the european countries .",
    "the information about the election ballots and the political spectrum of the party are collected from the website @xcite . the empirical result shown in figure 3 in comparison with the numerical result",
    "is averaged over 11 countries , 159 parties and 186 elections .",
    "the data in figure 3(b ) shows that most voters are located around the middle of the political spectrum and few voters for the positions approaching the two extreme points , which statistically confirms the numerical result of the model . notice that this result is obtained without considering the influence of the thermostat .",
    "let us now turn to the subnetwork of parties .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the number of parties first decreases and then reaches a quasi - stable state with fluctuation .",
    "the inset of figure 4 shows straight lines in log - linear scale , meaning that the evolution of the number of parties approximately has an exponential form .",
    "the relaxation time before reaching the quasi - stable state depends on both the time ratio ( @xmath48 ) and the initial number of political parties .",
    "larger @xmath48 and initial number of parties result in longer relaxation time .",
    "this is reasonable since large @xmath48 slows down the evolution of the opinion subnetwork with respect to the agent subnetwork whose evolution decides the time course of the whole network , and large number of parties need more time to be reduced to the quasi - stable numbers .",
    "the reason for the fluctuation of the number of remaining parties in the quasi - stable state is that the system periodically goes through splitting and merging . in average ,",
    "the fluctuation period increases with increasing @xmath48 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is observed that the time average number @xmath50 of remaining parties depends on the exponent @xmath51 of the interaction strength and on the initial number of parties , where @xmath52 is the number of parties at time @xmath43 .",
    "this is shown in figure 6 .",
    "larger initial number of parties results in larger final number of parties for fixed size of agent subnetwork ( @xmath53 ) , and larger @xmath51 leads to smaller final number of parties .",
    "this later effect is certainly the consequence of the party union enhanced by the interaction strength which is larger for larger @xmath51 at the same distance since the normalized distance is smaller than 1 . in figure 6(b ) , one observes a sharp drop of @xmath50 from around 20 to 2 at about @xmath54 .",
    "the lifetime of the defunct parties is recorded and compared with the empirical data we collected from the website @xcite with @xmath55 defunct parties . in order to compare the time scales of numerical and empirical data ,",
    "we normalized the lifetime by dividing it with the maximum lifetime of each data . it is found ( figure 7 ) that the numbers of the defunct parties are distributed over lifetime in a power - law with an exponent close to 2 , which is similar to the heavy tail of waiting time distribution in human dynamics@xcite .      in order to study the evolution of the topological structure of the agent subnetwork under the influence of the merging / splitting dynamics of the party subnetwork and of the link adding / deleting and opinion change dynamics of the agents",
    ", we studied a quantity called solidarity @xmath56 of a party @xmath4 which is defined for each party as the ratio between the number of links among the agents of this party to the number of links these agents have with the agents of other parties .",
    "it is observed that there are three typical steps in the time evolution of @xmath56 indicating a gradual formation of political community structure and the variation of the community character with the dynamics of the opinion subnetwork . in order to show this ,",
    "the time evolution of the maximum solidarity @xmath57 and average solidarity @xmath58 is drawn in fig.8 .    at @xmath42 ,",
    "the maximum and average solidarity are in the order of @xmath59 . then there is a quick increase of @xmath57 up to a climax of about 3.2 around @xmath60 followed by a steep descent down to about 0.2 .",
    "this culmination ( more or less sharp ) happens later on approximately every 200 steps which corresponds to the time period of the fluctuation of party numbers in the quasi - stable state .",
    "the sharp peaks correspond to the smallest numbers of parties .",
    "in other words , the periods of increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath57 correspond to periods of merging ( splitting ) of the parties .",
    "the behavior of @xmath58 is similar to that of the @xmath57 .",
    "this similarity can be explained as follows .",
    "since most of the parties have very small @xmath56 , and only few parties have very large @xmath57 , the average solidarity is mainly determined by the solidarity of the large parties .    since the initial values of @xmath56 are all about @xmath59 in the random agent subnetwork ( no political influence ) , the increasing @xmath56 up to values much larger than the initial ones means a politicization of the agent subnetwork in the evolution , or a formation of political community .",
    "this politicization is particularly strong in the periods when there are few parties .",
    "it is also found that the average degree @xmath61 of the agent subnetwork is almost a constant during the evolution .",
    "the relative average degree @xmath62 for each party , i.e. , the average degree of the agents belonging to the party @xmath4 divided by the average degree of the whole agent subnetwork , is always close to 1 .",
    "figure 9 shows the time evolution of the maximum relative average degree @xmath63 and of the mean of relative average degree @xmath64 , both of them decrease first and then fluctuate around 1 .",
    "this result indicates that , in average , the total number of links in the system does not change despite the dynamics of link adding / deleting and the formation of political community . in average ,",
    "each agent has more or less the same degree in the evolution .",
    "the above result implies that there is a redistribution of links in the evolution .",
    "initially , the links is uniformly distributed among all agents at any distance and , later on , are redistributed mainly among the agents belonging to the same parties .",
    "this aspect of the community formation can be seen in the evolution of a quantity we called political distance between the linked agents which is defined for a pair of linked agents by the distance between their respective parties .",
    "figure 10 shows the political distance distribution of links at three typical time steps .",
    "the distribution changes from the initial semi - gaussian distribution to the final semi - delta type distribution around zero distance , a strong sign of the politicization of the population or formation of political community .",
    "this result is reasonable if one considers the dynamics of adding / deleting links regulated by the interaction strength between the parties , i.e. , the evolution favors the links between agents having the same opinions .",
    "in addition to the interaction between the agent subnetwork and opinion subnetwork , the influence of the evolution of other social networks plays an important role in opinion formation .",
    "this environmental influence is a kind of external force represented in this dual modeling by the temperature of a thermostat which enters into the interaction strength through the exponential factor @xmath65 in eq.([eq2 ] ) . when the `` temperature '' @xmath12 of the thermostat is larger ( or smaller ) than average opinion , this factor is larger ( or smaller ) than 1 , which yields a larger ( or smaller ) interaction strength for larger @xmath18 position .",
    "figure 11(a ) shows the evolution of average opinion with two different temperatures in comparison with the result without thermostat . the average opinion ( initially at 0.5 ) shifts to the left ( @xmath66 ) when @xmath67 and to the right ( @xmath68 ) when @xmath69",
    "however , it always ends around 0.4 without thermostat .",
    "the maximum average opinion is @xmath70 no matter how high @xmath12 is .",
    "however , at low temperature , the minimum average opinion can be very close to the extreme left .",
    "the thermostat also has influence on the final numbers of parties . as the figure 11(b ) shows , higher @xmath12 leads to larger final number of remaining parties .",
    "as @xmath12 is larger than @xmath71 , the average number of remaining party is @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath53 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath50 is 2 when @xmath12 is below 0.2 .",
    "this result is in accordance with the result in figure 11(a ) , lower temperature @xmath12 leads to a small number of remaining parties located on the left side of the political spectrum .",
    "when the temperature is above 0.2 , in average more than 20 remaining parties are located mainly on the right side of the political spectrum .",
    "the jump of @xmath50 around @xmath76 happens when @xmath15 .",
    "this explanation is in agreement with the effect of the thermostat on the interaction strength mentioned above , i.e. , @xmath16 favors the shift of the parties and agents to the right , while @xmath21 favors their shift to the left . in other words ,",
    "this `` transition of political regime '' from a `` strong democracy '' ( more than 20 remaining parties in average ) to a `` weak democracy '' even a `` dictatorship '' ( 2 remaining parties in average ) is a consequence of the exponential factor of the thermostat of this model .",
    "the small number of parties for @xmath21 can be explained by the large merging probability due to the small distances between the parties squeezed by the low temperature in a small region close to the the extreme left .",
    "the high temperature does not have the same squeezing effect to the right due to the asymmetrical property of temperature mentioned in section ii .",
    "the thermostat does not change sensibly other aspects such as the relaxation time , lifetime distribution and the structure of agent network .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a dual modeling of opinion network .",
    "the model is composed of two interacting subnetworks , each having its own evolution mechanisms . in the opinion subnetwork",
    ", two parties can merge into a new one , and any composite party can split into two parties . in the agent subnetwork , opinion change and link adding / deleting take place .",
    "the above dynamics occurs in a probabilistic way depending on the interaction strength between the political parties , their age , and their attractivity .",
    "the global network is in contact with a thermostat representing the environmental influence on this dual network .",
    "the numerical results of the model for the opinion subnetwork can be summarized as follows . when the thermostat is not taken into account",
    ", the party number decays exponentially from initial number to a quasi - stable regime in which the party number fluctuates quasi - periodically with alternative merging and splitting periods .",
    "the average number of remaining parties is around 20 for initial number @xmath74 and the exponent @xmath77 .",
    "this average number is 2 for @xmath78 .",
    "the lifetime distribution of the parties given by this model was verified with empirical data .",
    "if we call the state of 20 parties a strong democracy regime and the state of 2 or 1 parties a weak democratic or dictatorship regime , there is a transition between these two regimes at about @xmath54 driven by an order parameter @xmath51 which is the exponent in the interaction strength between parties .",
    "this same transition between two political regimes also takes place with temperature of the thermostat when this latter is considered and @xmath77 .",
    "the critical temperature is the average opinion @xmath79 .",
    "another effect of the thermostat is that very low temperature squeezes a very small number of parties ( weak democratic regime or dictatorship ) to the extreme left region , and very high temperature pushes numerous remaining parties to be dispersed in the whole right wings .    on the other hand , for the agent subnetwork ,",
    "when the thermostat is not considered , the system ends in a stable distribution of agents over the political spectrum with majority of the agents in the middle of the spectrum , no matter what is the initial condition .",
    "this is mainly the result of the interaction strength @xmath6 which favors the merging dynamics of the parties close to each in the middle of the political spectrum and the concentration of agents in that region .",
    "this stable distribution is in accordance with empirical data .",
    "another important feature of this model is the time evolution of the politicization of the agents from the initial non political topological structure of the population .",
    "this political community formation and its time fluctuating character are consequences of the merging / splitting dynamics .",
    "the politicization is extremely strong in the periods or regime where there are few remaining parties .",
    "the quantities `` solidarity '' and `` political distance '' are used to characterize the degree of this politicization .",
    "this model is an effort to make more realistic modeling of opinion networks on the basis of the previous agent - based opinion network .",
    "although some general features are new , such as the regime transition , the party s lifetime distribution , solidarity , external influence and so forth , many features are similar to the consensus dynamics of agent - based models . for example , the strong ( weak ) politicization can be seen as a strong ( weak or poly- ) consensus state .",
    "many general features and characteristics of the dynamics are in accordance with empirical data or phenomena of the society .",
    "examples include the party lifetime distribution , voter distribution over parties and the exponential relaxation .",
    "the politicization of the population with quasi - periodical oscillation is also an general phenomena of our society .",
    "all these results can not be purely coincidence and should be the consequence of some realistic dynamical mechanisms included in the model .",
    "the present work used only a very basic interacting dual network modeling .",
    "more realistic improvements are feasible in this approach by further consideration of , for example , more variable in the political spectra as proposed@xcite , more subnetworks , multiple thermostats representing different influences from culture , economy , natural disasters , international environment etc , and more general dependence of the involved probabilities on the various parameters .",
