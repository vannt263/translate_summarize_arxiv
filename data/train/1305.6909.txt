    "nowadays , the diffused innovation policies require frequent survival estimates based on necessarily small samples .",
    "that may happen when the reliability of technological products  continuously improved  must be monitored ; or when the efficacy of always - new chemotherapy must be promptly checked .",
    "in helping statisticians to choose a suitable survival model , careful consideration of the generative mechanisms of the involved random variable ( rv ) plays an important ( often neglected ) role . such consideration can supplement or even prevail over usual model selection procedures , when the observations are extremely few and , consequently , the information about the effective shape of the `` parent '' distribution ( i.e. the population distribution ) is very scarce .    in this context",
    ", the paper provides the mathematical models of three typical generative mechanisms of the inverse weibull ( iw ) rv .",
    "so , the paper helps exploiting the iw model to give correct answers for some specific survival problems , found in biometry and reliability , for which it appears the natural interpretative stochastic model .    doubtless , the iw rv is not widely known and so scarcely identified .",
    "the iw model is referred to by many different names like `` frechet - type '' ( johnson et al .",
    "1995 ) , `` complementary weibull '' ( drapella 1993 ) , `` reciprocal weibull '' ( lu and meeker 1993 ; mudholkar and kollia 1994 ) , and `` inverse weibull '' ( erto 1982 ; erto 1989 ; johnson et al . 1994 ; murthy et al .",
    ". an early study of the iw model is reported in the unprocurable paper ( erto 1989 ) .",
    "however , it seems to be no comprehensive reference in the literature that studies the iw as survival model . this paper tries to do that specifically exploring its peculiar probabilistic and statistical characteristics .",
    "the peculiar heavy right tail of probability density as well as the upside - down bathtub ( ubt ) shaped hazard function of the iw model has been really found in several applications ( nelson 1990 ; rausand and reinertsen 1996 ; gupta et al . 1997 ; gupta et al .",
    "1999 ; jiang et al . 2003 ) .",
    "also the inverse gamma , inverse gaussian , log - normal , log - logistic , and the birnbaum - saunders models show similarly shaped hazard rates ( glen 2011 ; klein and moeschberger 2003 ; lai and xie 2006 ) .",
    "however , a model incorrectly fitted to iw data may lead to very wrong critical prognoses , even despite its good fitting to the empirical distribution .",
    "in fact , especially when few observations are available , the empirical distribution contains scarce information about the shape of the far - right tail , which is the main and unusual feature of the iw distribution .",
    "so , the knowledge of primary generative mechanisms leading to the iw rv can help one not to miss its proper application in some real life peculiar circumstances , analytically shown in the following .",
    "obviously , the inverse of the iw data follows a weibull distribution .",
    "so the parameter estimates of the iw distribution can be easily obtained by applying to its reciprocal data the same standard procedures implemented in packages for the weibull model ( see murthy et al .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the iw rv @xmath0 with scale parameter @xmath1 and shape parameter @xmath2 is : @xmath3 it is skewed and unimodal for @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5th moment of the iw rv is @xmath6 and it exists if @xmath7 then the mean @xmath8 and the variance @xmath9 follows .",
    "the most distinctive applicative feature of the iw model is its heavy right tail . that is highlighted by the _ property n. 1 _ : `` the pdf of the iw model is infinitesimal of lower order than the negative exponential as @xmath10 goes to infinity . '' in fact , the ratio of the iw pdf ( [ eq1 ] ) ( setting @xmath11 , for simplicity ) to the negative exponential function goes to infinity as @xmath10 goes to infinity .    the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath12 , the survival function ( sf ) @xmath13 and the hazard rate ( hr ) @xmath14 are easily derived from ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath15 @xmath16 the hr is infinitesimal as @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "it is unimodal and belongs to the ubt class ( see glaser 1980 ) with only one change point : _ property n. 2 _ : `` the hr of the iw model has a unique global maximum between the mode @xmath17 and the value @xmath18 . ''",
    "the condition of maximum for the iw hr does not lead to a closed - form solution .",
    "however , taking the derivative of the logarithm of the iw hr ( and appropriately arranging the terms ) the necessary condition for the maximum of the hr implies that : @xmath19 the auxiliary functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to the first and second members of this equation , have a unique intersection point . in the first quadrant these two functions are both increasing up to their maximum point , whose abscissa is for both functions equal to @xmath22 and then they are both decreasing and infinitesimal to the same order as @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "moreover , it is possible to verify that @xmath20 is null as @xmath10 goes to 0 , while @xmath23 is null for the iw mode @xmath24 . because of the following inequalities : @xmath25 we derive that the intersection point of the two auxiliary functions , that is the maximum point of the hr , falls between the mode @xmath26 and @xmath18 .    the mean residual life ( @xmath27 , also called the life expectancy of the @xmath28 fraction of items lived longer than @xmath29 is : @xmath30 being @xmath31 the lower incomplete gamma function .    the following _",
    "property n. 3 _ stands : `` the @xmath27 function of the iw model is bathtub - shaped . ''",
    "this property can be deduced from the general results given in gupta and akman ( 1995 ) and is in agreement with the properties of the hr .",
    "so , the iw model belongs to the class of distribution for which the reciprocity of the shape of the hr and @xmath27 functions holds .",
    "specifically , the @xmath27 decreases from the initial value @xmath32 ( as @xmath10 goes to 0 ) to its minimum at the change point @xmath33 and then increases infinitely as @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "being @xmath34 ( e.g. , see lai and xie , 2006 , chap .",
    "4 ) , the change point @xmath33 must solve the equation @xmath35 necessarily .    in practice",
    ", this peculiar @xmath27 shape can be found , for example , in some biometry problems when the longer the patient s survival time from his tumor ablation the better his prognosis .",
    "if @xmath36 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables , the limit distribution for their maximum is the iw distribution ( [ eq2 ] ) ( johnson _ et al . _ 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , for instance , when a disease or failure is related to the maximum value of a critical non - negative variable , this generative mechanism can be considered .",
    "this generative mechanism differs from the following three new ones , since for these the time variable does play an explicit role in their modeling .",
    "let @xmath37 be a system deterioration index that , as such , is a strictly increasing function of the run time @xmath10 .",
    "at every intercept with the vertical line passing through @xmath10 , suppose that the uncertainty about @xmath37 can be reasonably fitted by a weibull pdf , with shape parameter constant and scale parameter @xmath38 , function of @xmath10 , modeled by a generic power law : @xmath39 if a threshold ( maximum , positive ) value allowed for @xmath37 exists , the system has the iw sf .",
    "in fact , consider a weibull random variable @xmath37 with pdf : @xmath40 , \\\\",
    "y\\ge 0,\\quad v,\\;u>0 \\\\    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , the shape parameter , is constant , and @xmath42 , the scale parameter , is the drift function ( [ eq8 ] ) . if @xmath43 is the threshold ( maximum , positive ) value for @xmath37 , then : @xmath44 } .\\ ] ] substituting @xmath45 back into the previous relationship , we obtain : @xmath46.\\ ] ] on putting @xmath47 and @xmath48 the iw sf follows .",
    "this mechanism is found in many technological corrosion phenomena that give rise to failures only when they reach a threshold deepness @xmath49 the mechanism is found also in many biologic degenerative phenomena ( i.e. , gradual deterioration of organs and cells ) where the loss of function appears when the deterioration deep @xmath37 reaches a fixed threshold value . besides , this mechanism is found when tumors spread potential metastases with a dissemination probability proportional to their size @xmath37 .",
    "hence , a tumor size greater than a given threshold value @xmath43 causes a rate of occurrence of metastases which is really first increasing and then decreasing ( see le cam and neyman 1982 , p. 253 ) like the iw one ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "if the stress @xmath50 ( in the broad sense ) is a rv with distribution that can be reasonably fitted by a weibull model and the strength @xmath51 that opposes @xmath52 is a decreasing function of time @xmath10 that can be modeled by a generic power law : @xmath53 the resulting sf is the iw one .",
    "in fact , if the stress @xmath50 is a weibull random variable : @xmath54 and the strength @xmath51 that opposes @xmath52 follows the decreasing function of time ( [ eq12 ] ) : @xmath55 . \\\\    \\end{array}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath56 back into the previous relationship , we obtain : @xmath57\\ ] ] then , renaming @xmath58 and @xmath48 the iw sf follows .",
    "this mechanism is common for many mechanical components ( see , for example , bury 1975 , p. 593 ; shigley 1977 , p. 184 ) as well as it is found in patients with a decreasing vital strength following the ( [ eq12 ] ) ( e.g. , because they are subjected to intensive and prolonged chemotherapy ) and subjected to a relapse having a random virulence or gravity @xmath59 in these cases , an hr first quickly increasing and then slowly decreasing , is sometimes surprisingly observed ( see carter et al .",
    "1983 , p. 79 ) .",
    "suppose that a disease ( or failure ) is latent and the physiological defensive attempts averse to it occur randomly according to a poisson model .",
    "if the probability of one successful defensive attempt depends on the incubation time @xmath10 ( but not on the number of previously occurred defensive actions ) according to a generic power law decreasing function : @xmath60 the iw cdf follows . in fact , suppose that the random variable @xmath61 describing the physiological defensive attempts against a latent disease ( or failure ) , occurs according to a poisson law : @xmath62 let @xmath63 be the probability of one successful defensive attempt , which depends on the incubation time @xmath10 ( but not on the number of previously occurred defensive actions ) according to the function ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the probability of manifest disease ( or failure ) is : @xmath64 then , on putting @xmath65 and @xmath66 the iw cdf follows .",
    "this mechanism is found in biometry when the immune system works randomly against antigens , and its effectiveness decreases as the disease expands ( see le cam and neyman 1982 , p. 15 ) . in reliability",
    ", this mechanism is found when a technological system is randomly ( i.e. , without any definite plan ) maintained : the smaller the time from the beginning of the failure process ( up to the maintenance action ) the greater the maintenance efficacy .",
    "consider the following 50 pseudo random ( ordered ) data generated from a ",
    "close - to - standard \" parent cdf ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( we can not put @xmath69 since , in general , the @xmath5th moment of the iw pdf exists if @xmath70 ) :    0.2776 , 0.2931 , 0.3384 , 0.4321 , 0.4739 , 0.4771 , 0.5331 , 0.5424 , 0.5482 , 0.5571 , 0.6139 , 0.6451 , 0.6523 , 0.6587 , 0.7166 , 0.7838 , 0.8466 , 0.8892 , 0.9278 , 0.9651 , 1.008 , 1.051 , 1.123 , 1.203 , 1.213 , 1.366 , 1.529 , 1.795 , 1.947 , 2.093 , 2.143 , 2.189 , 2.246 , 2.453 , 2.526 , 2.858 , 2.924 , 3.381 , 3.383 , 3.587 , 4.964 , 5.101 , 5.139 , 6.753 , 10.11 , 11.37 , 12.68 , 16.88 , 17.25 , 19.07 .    the anderson - darling statistic ( anderson and darling 1954 ) @xmath71 , with a @xmath72-value equal to 0.94333 , shows the high conformity of this sample to the parent cdf .",
    "incidentally , in this paper , we chose this specific goodness - of - fit test since it emphasizes the tails of the presumed parent distribution .",
    "however , in the above case , also tests that give less weight to the tails lead to similar results .",
    "suppose that we want to identify a generic cdf model being very well fitted to both the data and the parent cdf , but we do nt have any strong information about the latter .",
    "we decide to adopt a `` less informative model '' which is coherent with our poor information .",
    "we chose a polynomial cumulative hr ( hr ) model of order 3 , since it is the minimum able to fit a non - monotone model too .",
    "in our ( simulated ) condition , we can define an excellent `` a priori '' model by fitting the polynomial to 50 points ( vertically equally spaced ) of the known parent cdf .",
    "the resulting model is : @xmath73 which has a coefficient of determination @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , being the anderson - darling statistic @xmath75 , with a @xmath72-value equal to 0.2856 , this `` a priori '' model appears very well fitted to data too .",
    "incidentally , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimates of its three parameters give the following polynomial hr model very close to the former ( [ eq19 ] ) : @xmath76 which has a coefficient of determination @xmath77 .",
    "suppose now that the analysis of the generative mechanism suggests us to fit the iw model to the 50 data .",
    "the ml estimates of its parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the coefficient of determination of the hr function estimated from this iw model is @xmath80 .",
    "the anderson - darling statistic is @xmath81 with a @xmath72-value equal to 0.9530 .",
    "although the previous analysis has shown that the two cdf models fit the data very well , some important characteristics could be different . to highlight that , we compare some critical estimates obtained from the `` a priori and less informative '' model ( [ eq19 ] ) with those obtained using the last `` fitted and informative '' iw model . from these two models",
    "we obtain the @xmath27 estimates reported in  [ tab1 ] , where the true values are those of the parent population .",

    "this example is representative of the critical real - world situations in which only tiny data sets are available .",
    "the dataset consists of 15 times to breakdown ( in minutes ) of an insulating fluid between electrodes at a constant voltage @xmath82 ( 36 kv ) , provided in nelson ( 1982 , p. 105 ) :    0.35 , 0.59 , 0.96 , 0.99 , 1.69 , 1.97 , 2.07 , 2.58 , 2.71 , 2.90 , 3.67 , 3.99 , 5.35 , 13.77 , 25.50 .",
    "unfortunately , due to small size of the sample , we can not rely on the sample point @xmath83 on the graph of  [ fig1 ] to start the selection of a reasonable model .",
    "however , analyzing the experiment ( aiming to derive the lifetime distribution of the insulating fluid ) we come to the conclusion that it shows an example of the `` deterioration '' mechanism close to the one described in section 3.1 .",
    "in fact , the mean of the insulating resistance @xmath84 of the fluid decreases according to a positive ( and less than one ) power function of time .",
    "this model belongs to the arrhenius class of cumulative damage relationships , widely found in life tests with constant stress ( see , e.g. , nelson 1990 ) .",
    "consequently , the mean of the resistive leakage current @xmath85 ( i.e. , the system deterioration index @xmath86 increases with a positive ( and greater than one ) power of time to the dielectric failure , which occurs when a threshold value @xmath43 ( fixed by the operating and environmental conditions supposed constant ) is exceeded .",
    "moreover , the nature of the failure mechanism is stationary and does not induce any change in the shape of the @xmath87 pdf .",
    "then , a pdf model  with mean increasing as a power function of time and with constant shape  is well rendered by the weibull model ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "in fact , being constant the shape parameter @xmath41 , its mean @xmath88 is effectively a positive ( and greater than one ) power function of the time .    hence we decide to assume the iw model as our weighted hypothesis .",
    "however , we consider also the log - logistic model because , as shown in  [ fig1 ] , it plays the role of a frontier separating the iw model and many other alternative models .",
    "the ml estimates of the iw parameters are @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; the anderson - darling statistic is @xmath91 with a @xmath72-value equal to 0.596 ; the _ mll _ is @xmath92 .",
    "the ml estimates of the log - logistic parameters are @xmath93 and @xmath94 and the anderson - darling statistic is @xmath95 with a @xmath72-value equal to 0.870 ; the maximized log - likelihood is @xmath96 . the comparison of the two alternative models by means of the anderson - darling statistic and the _ mlls _",
    "( both at their ml value ) would support the log - logistic model .",
    "however , we think that the differences are not enough large ( e.g. only 0.3 unit separates the two _ mlls _ ) to contradict the previous choice based on a careful and detailed technological analysis .",
    "the paper proves that the iw distribution is another of the relatively few ubt survival distributions .",
    "so , when dealing with ubt distributions , it is helpful to have an alternative model that has , moreover , a distinctive heavy right tail .",
    "this paper demonstrates how the iw distribution is the natural candidate , among all the survival models , to face three unreported classes of real and well defined degenerative phenomena .",
    "so the practitioners are helped to choose this model by profiting from the knowledge of the involved phenomena , such as a disease or failure , rather than exclusively on the usual analysis of goodness - of - fit .",
    "some illustrative examples show that the polynomial cumulative hazard model and the log - logistic one can both fit the cdf of iw data very well .",
    "the polynomial model is used as antithetic benchmark because : a ) differently from the iw model , it is capable of giving a wide range of hr shapes ; b ) it is used in situations where strong assumptions about the parent distribution are unavailable .",
    "the log - logistic model has been considered because : a ) it is the closest model which shares the upside - down bathtub ( ubt ) shaped hazard function ; b ) it plays the role of a frontier separating the iw model from many other alternative models .",
    "however , all the illustrative examples show that the above models  even though very well fitted to iw data  may be very misleading because they entail highly incorrect assessments concerning , for instance , the mean residual life .",
    "the paper proves that  when any knowledge about generative mechanism is unavailable  selecting between the iw and the log - logistic models that one which minimizes the anderson - darling statistic or , even better , maximizes the likelihood is a very effective procedure .",
    "finally , we show that for the iw and log - logistic models both selection criteria are independent of hypothetical distribution parameters , and the corresponding probabilities of correct selection are respectively greater than 0.85 and 0.93 when the size of the available sample is greater than 50 . instead ,",
    "when the size of the available sample is less than 30 ( i.e. , in a very frequent situation in the technological and biological fields ) selecting the correct model purely on the basis of the empirical distribution remains a highly risky procedure , since the probabilities of wrong selection are respectively greater than 0.23 and 0.12 . +",
