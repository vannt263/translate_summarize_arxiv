    "in contrast to the isotropic @xmath4-wave contact interaction , dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) has a very distinct character  anisotropic and long - range .",
    "this character results in various interesting phenomena in ultracold dipolar atom or molecule systems .",
    "the studies of ddi effect on the structure and dynamics of quantum many - body systems is at the forefront of both theoretical and experimental interests . in recent years",
    "dipolar chromium ( @xmath5cr ) atoms were created with a magnetic moment of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is bohr magneton ) , which is equivalent to a dipole moment @xmath8 ( @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , creations of dipolar molecules have also been achieved in ultracold heteronuclear molecules such as @xmath10k@xmath11rb with a much stronger dipole moment @xmath12  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , many interesting physical properties have been studied , such as biconcave shapes of the ground state  @xcite , intriguing collapse mechanisms  @xcite , vortex structures  @xcite , anisotropic solitons  @xcite and so on .    among many others ,",
    "properties of _ nonoverlapping _ dipolar bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in bilayer or multilayer ( quasi-1d optical lattice ) stacks have attracted great attention in recent years .",
    "the topics under investigation include phonon instability  @xcite , soliton - soliton scattering  @xcite , pair superfluidity  @xcite , and filament condensation  @xcite . in these systems",
    ", condensates are effectively nonoverlapping between neighboring layers and as a matter of fact , contact or even short - range interaction plays no role between neighboring layers . however",
    ", long - range ddi will still play an important role across different layers .",
    "moreover in a real system , dipoles of the dipolar gas are usually aligned ( by applying strong electric or magnetic field ) along the direction of the stacks .",
    "this in turn will make dipolar molecular systems more stable against recombination and result in better opportunity of forming dipolar molecular bec .",
    "this paper attempts to study collective excitations of nonoverlapping atomic or molecular bec in bilayer and multilayer stacks , that are coupled by long - range ddi .",
    "the focus will be placed on the motions of the _ centers _ of condensates .",
    "when weakly interacting bose condensates are loaded into a single harmonic ( magnetic ) trap , it is well known that , for small oscillations , center motion of condensates will undergo harmonic oscillation of frequency equal to the characteristic trap frequency  @xcite .",
    "this remains true even when the system has a long - range ddi in it .",
    "when condensates are loaded into a double well and form a bilayer system in , say , @xmath13 direction ( while a single harmonic trap is applied in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane ) , center motions of the two condensate clouds can be very interesting upon the activation of long - range ddi .",
    "it will be shown explicitly that when ddi is present , both in - phase and out - of - phase motions of the two condensate centers will still undergo harmonic oscillations ( for small oscillations ) . however , while in - phase modes are independent of ddi , out - of - phase modes will depend crucially on the strength of ddi .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting to investigate center motions of nonoverlapping condensates in a multilayer stack ( quasi-1d optical lattice along @xmath13-direction ) . by properly treating the boundary effect ( see later ) , transverse modes associated with motions of the centers of condensates in each layer are found to be optical phonon like . at infinitely long wavelength limit ( @xmath16 ) , phonon mode frequency just equals to the harmonic trap frequency in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane and at the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the lattice constant ) , phonon mode velocity is found to be proportional to the square root of the strength of ddi . due to the long - range character of ddi , for the multilayer system of finite number of layers ,",
    "it is important to treat properly the boundary effect . with this regard ,",
    "we have introduced a truncation number ( @xmath19 ) which corresponds to number of neighboring layers included for satisfactorily converged results .",
    "it is found that @xmath19 will depend on the ratio of lattice constant ( @xmath18 ) and condensate radius in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane only .    to end this introductory section , we emphasize two things .",
    "firstly , the results presented in this paper , especially the dependence of ddi strength on center motion mode frequencies , are believed to be valid even when the system is not bose condensed . since long - range ddi survives in the non - condensed system , it is encouraging that the experiment can also be done on the ultracold heteronuclear dipolar molecules which exhibits a strong dipole moment but nevertheless is yet to be bose condensed  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the strength of ddi can actually be extracted through measurements of out - of - phase mode in the bilayer or transverse phonon mode in the multilayer stack .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in sec .",
