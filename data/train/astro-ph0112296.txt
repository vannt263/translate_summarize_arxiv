    "the deuterium - to - hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio is of central importance to many areas of astrophysics . in the standard big bang cosmology ,",
    "the primordial d / h value places strong constraints on the total baryon content in the universe .",
    "since the deuterium abundance is believed to decrease with time due to the destruction of deuterium in stellar interiors , measurements of the local d / h value in our galaxy provide a lower limit for the primordial d / h value , while measurements of d / h in the lyman-@xmath9 forest provide an estimate that may be closer to the true primordial d / h ratio .",
    "comparing the local and lyman-@xmath9 forest values provides a measure of how much stellar processing of material has occurred during the lifetime of the milky way galaxy .",
    "measurements of d / h in different locations in the galaxy can provide critical tests of galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "the _ copernicus _ satellite provided the first accurate d / h measurements within the galactic ism . @xcite measured @xmath10 toward @xmath11  cen , and @xcite quoted an average value of @xmath12 for several lines of sight observed by _",

    "* ) . estimating the primordial value from the lyman-@xmath9 forest has proved to be more difficult , although these measurements do suggest a higher d / h in the lyman-@xmath9 forest compared with the lic , as one would expect ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a more thorough review of these intergalactic d / h measurements and how they relate to galactic d / h , see @xcite .    however , the lic d / h value quoted above is also problematic , as it measures only very local interstellar gas .",
    "values of d / h elsewhere in the galaxy could in principle be much different , since material in different parts of the galaxy has undergone varying amounts of stellar processing .",
    "evidence for variations of d / h within the lism have in fact been found for longer lines of sight sampling many clouds , based on data from hst and the imaps instrument @xcite .",
    "measuring the variation of d / h within the galaxy is important both for determining the degree of mixing of ism material within the milky way , and for determining a better estimate for the mean present day galactic d / h value .",
    "unfortunately , hst is not able to obtain measurements of d / h for long lines of sight through the galaxy , because for column densities greater than @xmath15 @xmath16 the h  i ly@xmath9 absorption becomes so broad that it completely obscures the d i absorption .",
    "measuring deuterium at different locations throughout our galaxy is one of the primary missions of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) . unlike hst",
    ", fuse can observe the higher lines of the h  i lyman series , which allows deuterium to be observed for higher ism column densities .",
    "this paper is one of a series reporting the first deuterium measurements made with fuse @xcite , including a summary paper of these initial results @xcite .",
    "the line of sight analyzed here is that toward the white dwarf wd  1634 - 573 ( = hd  149499b ) .",
    "table  1 lists properties of our target star , which is a very metal poor do white dwarf unlikely to have photospheric metal lines contaminating the ism absorption lines in which we are interested @xcite .",
    "there is a k0  v companion star ( hd  149499a ) that will be in the fuse aperture for our observations .",
    "however , even though this star is believed to be quite active @xcite , emission from this star will not be detectable against the very bright continuum of the hot white dwarf , based on extrapolations of h  i lyman line fluxes observed for other active single k dwarfs .    with a path length of only @xmath17  pc @xcite",
    ", the wd  1634 - 573 line of sight does not exceed the distance scale of deuterium measurements accessible to hst .",
    "however , the h  i column density estimated from _",
    "extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( euve )",
    "data is @xmath18 @xmath16 @xcite , too high for deuterium to be detectable in ly@xmath9 , so this line of sight _ does _ extend deuterium measurements to higher columns than are measurable with hst .",
    "the do white dwarf wd  1634 - 573 has been observed by fuse three times through the low resolution ( lwrs ) aperture and twice through the medium resolution ( mdrs ) aperture .",
    "these observations are listed in table  2 . collectively , the lwrs data set consists of 28 separate exposures with a total exposure time of 19,406 s , while the mdrs data set consists of 37 separate exposures totaling 18,225 s.    in order to fully cover its 9051187    spectral range , fuse has a multi - channel design  two channels ( lif1 and lif2 ) use al+lif coatings , two channels ( sic1 and sic2 ) use sic coatings , and there are two different detectors ( a and b ) . for a full description of the instrument , see @xcite . with this design fuse",
    "acquires spectra in eight segments covering different , overlapping wavelength ranges . for both of the lwrs and mdrs data sets , the individual exposures processed in the standard fuse pipeline ( version 1.6.9 ) are cross - correlated and coadded to create a single spectrum for each segment .",
    "we decided not to coadd the individual segments to ensure that such an operation would not degrade the spectral resolution .",
    "instead , a spectrum covering the full fuse spectral range is spliced together from several different segments . to be more precise , the spectrum combines the following segments : sic1b ( 910925   ) , sic2a ( 925995   ) , lif1a ( 9951075   ) , sic2b ( 10751095   ) , and lif2a ( 10951180   ) .",
    "we keep the lwrs and mdrs spectra separate , since the spectral resolution of the two may be slightly different .",
    "this also gives us two separate spectra that we can analyze independently to see if we obtain the same answer from both data sets ( see below ) .",
    "one exception is the h  i ly@xmath11 line at 1025   . for the lwrs spectrum",
    ", there is substantial contamination from airglow emission in this line , which is not the case in the mdrs data thanks to the narrower aperture .",
    "thus , we import the mdrs ly@xmath11 line into the lwrs spectrum to allow the analysis of the lwrs data to also consider this important line .",
    "airglow is also a potential contaminant for many of the o  i and n  i lines @xcite , but the continuum fluxes of wd  1634 - 573 are high enough to overwhelm the airglow and we see no difference in the lwrs and mdrs spectra that would suggest a problem .",
    "since there is no wavelength calibration lamp onboard fuse , the wavelength scale produced by the fuse data reduction pipeline is very uncertain .",
    "thus , we identify many ism absorption lines throughout the lwrs and mdrs spectra and measure their centroids . for each segment ,",
    "the average shift between the centroids and rest wavelengths of lines within that segment is used to correct the wavelength scale and place it in the rest frame of the interstellar absorption .",
    "figure  1 shows the resulting reduced spectrum for the lwrs data .",
    "coadding the separate exposures of these segments helps to suppress fixed pattern noise somewhat .",
    "however , the spectrum in figure  1 shows that significant periodic fixed pattern noise remains in many locations , in particular the moir pattern mentioned by @xcite that produces noise with a period of about nine pixels .",
    "the effective signal - to - noise of our spectrum is in many locations limited by the moir ripples rather than actual photon noise .",
    "obtaining the most accurate measurements for column densities requires that the number of ism absorption components along the line of sight be known with some precision .",
    "unfortunately , fuse does not have sufficient spectral resolution to resolve the ism velocity structure unless the components are very widely separated , and there are also no high resolution hst or ground based data to provide this information .",
    "there are , however , a few moderate resolution hst spectra of wd  1634 - 573 taken on 1996 september 3 with the g160 m grating of the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) instrument formerly on board hst , and these spectra contain a few ism lines @xcite . in figure  2 , we plot the ism absorption lines of s  ii @xmath191259.519 and si  ii @xmath191260.422 on a heliocentric velocity scale .",
    "we have fitted the s  ii line with a single absorption component , with a correction for instrumental broadening assuming a gaussian instrumental profile with a width of 4.4 pixels @xcite .",
    "the s  ii line is centered at @xmath20 km  s@xmath21 , which is very close to the velocity predicted by the lic vector @xcite , @xmath22 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "actually , with galactic coordinates of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the wd  1634 - 573 line of sight is more likely to sample the so - called `` g cloud , '' a proposed very nearby cloud in the galactic center direction very similar to the lic in most respects , but which has a slightly different flow vector @xcite .",
    "the g cloud vector predicts a velocity of @xmath25 km  s@xmath21 , a bit farther from the measured value of @xmath20 km  s@xmath21 than the lic value , but still close enough to be consistent considering this is moderate rather than high resolution data .",
    "however , when the stronger , opaque si  ii @xmath191259.519 line is fitted with a single absorption component , the measured absorption centroid is @xmath26 km  s@xmath21 , a 4.4 km  s@xmath21 discrepancy with s  ii .",
    "an analogous effect is detectable in the fuse data , where optically thick lines also appear to be redshifted relative to optically thin lines nearby in the spectrum .",
    "this fact strongly suggests the presence of at least one extra velocity component along the line of sight , which is redshifted relative to the primary absorption component .",
    "thus , in figure  2 the si  ii line is fitted with two components , one with a velocity fixed at the velocity suggested by the s  ii line , and the other located redward of the main component by 17 km  s@xmath21 to account for the extra absorption on that side of the line .",
    "the doppler broadening parameters are forced to be the same for both components to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "unfortunately , at the resolution of the ghrs g160 m grating ( @xmath27 ) the ism lines are not resolved any more than they are for fuse , so the true velocity structure of the wd  1634 - 573 line of sight is still unknown .",
    "the fit to the si  ii line in figure  2 suggests at least one additional component redward of the primary component , but the fit is not quantitatively useful for accurately estimating component velocity separations or column density ratios .",
    "figure  1 provides a broad overview of the wd  1634 - 573 spectrum using the lwrs data .",
    "figure  3 shows closeups of many of the ism absorption lines using mdrs data .",
    "the wd  1634 - 573 spectral regions shown in figure  1 contain all of the absorption lines that we use to derive interstellar column densities for this line of sight for various elements .",
    "at least 21 h  i lyman lines are observable , from ly@xmath11 at 1025    down to the numerous h  i lines clustered near the lyman limit at 912   .",
    "the six strongest lyman lines are plotted in figure  4 on a velocity scale centered on the h  i absorption , showing that deuterium ( d  i ) absorption is detectable at about @xmath28 km  s@xmath21 in at least the strongest four lines ( ly@xmath11 through ly@xmath29 ) .    many o  i and n  i lines of varying strengths are also apparent in the fuse spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) , meaning fuse data should provide accurate measurements of o  i and n  i column densities .",
    "other atomic species with at least one detectable ism line are n  ii , p  ii , c  ii , c  iii , ar  i , fe  ii , and perhaps si  ii .",
    "the si  ii @xmath19989 line may be blended with a n  iii line at that location @xcite and its strength seems to be inconsistent with the nondetection of si  ii @xmath191020 , so that identification is listed with a question mark in figure  1 .",
    "as described by @xcite , the first fuse d / h analyses published in this series of articles are all the result of at least two independent analyses , and the study of wd  1634 - 573 presented here is no exception .",
    "this approach of using independent analyses with significantly different methods is the best way to estimate the magnitude of systematic errors , which are very difficult to quantify otherwise .",
    "the final column densities that we derive are compromise values consistent with the results of both of these independent analyses .",
    "several of us ( g.  h. , m.  l. , and a.  v .- m . ) analyzed the wd  1634 - 573 data in a manner very similar to the analysis of the wd  2211 - 495 line of sight described by @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for a thorough description .",
    "we now describe the other independent analysis in far more detail .    in order to analyze the absorption lines",
    ", we first estimate the stellar continuum overlying the absorption .",
    "this is done with a series of polynomial fits covering the entire fuse spectrum .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 . estimating the continuum above the ly@xmath11 @xmath191025 absorption requires a little more work because of the significant amount of absorption in the line wings .",
    "this wing absorption indicates that the lorentzian wings of the opacity profile are starting to become important , which in turn signifies that the line is no longer completely in the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "our initial guess for the background continuum assumed no wing absorption .",
    "after the initial fit was performed ( as described below ) , the fit to the ly@xmath11 spectral region was poor because of the presence of wing absorption , so the residuals of that fit were used to derive a higher continuum that would improve the quality of the fit .",
    "another iteration leads to the ly@xmath11 continuum shown in figures 1 and 4 .",
    "our fits to the absorption lines are global fits , where all the lines are fitted simultaneously .",
    "we use @xcite as our primary source for the necessary atomic data and @xcite for some of the higher h  i lyman lines . note that we use the @xcite line list available on the www ( ` http://www.hia.nrc.ca/staff/dcm/atomic_data.html ` ) ,",
    "for which many of the n  i oscillator strengths have been updated from their original published values .",
    "all clearly detected lines are identified in figure  1 and also listed in table  3 along with rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths .",
    "table  3 lists equivalent widths for the lines , except for cases where blending is too severe for an accurate measurement .",
    "the equivalent widths and quoted 2@xmath6 uncertainties are based on measurements of both the lwrs and mdrs spectra , assuming several different background continua estimations .",
    "however , in our fits not only are the detected lines included , but we also consider many undetected lines of atomic species with at least one detected line",
    ". these nondetections can provide useful upper limit constraints for our fitting routine .",
    "there are two o  i lines listed by @xcite that we do _ not _ include in our fits because their listed f values suggest line strengths that are clearly inconsistent with the observations , based on comparison with the other o  i lines seen in the spectrum .",
    "these are the o  i @xmath19972.1 and @xmath191026.5 lines .",
    "the oscillator strengths listed for these two lines must be incorrect .",
    "the primary free parameters of the global fit are the column densities of the various atomic species ( h  i , d  i , o  i , n  i , etc . ) .",
    "for all detected and unblended lines , we allow the centroid of the line to vary as a free parameter of the fit to account for inaccuracies in the wavelength calibration .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath30 ) and nonthermal velocity ( @xmath31 ) of the interstellar gas are also free parameters .",
    "the doppler broadening parameters ( @xmath32 ) of the various ism lines are computed from @xmath30 and @xmath31 using the equation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the atomic weight of the atomic species associated with each line .",
    "note , however , that because the lines are not resolved and because we can not accurately account for the multiple velocity components present in the lines ( see  3a ) , the validity of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 values derived in our fits is questionable .    in figures  1 and 3 ,",
    "a single - component global fit to the absorption lines is shown both before ( dotted line ) and after ( thick solid line ) convolution with the instrumental profile .",
    "figure  1 shows a fit to the lwrs data and figure  3 shows a fit to the mdrs data .",
    "unfortunately , the instrumental profile , or line spread function ( lsf ) , is not currently well known for fuse , and may in any case conceivably vary from one observation to the next depending on the accuracy of the pointing for that particular observation and on how accurately the individual exposures are cross - correlated and coadded @xcite .",
    "thus , the lsf is a free parameter of our fit .",
    "we assume a two - gaussian representation for the lsf , which we assume to be applicable over the entire fuse spectral region .",
    "this is just an approximation , however , as the lsf undoubtedly varies with wavelength .",
    "the fits in figures  1 and 3 are single - component fits performed as described above . in order to decide on the final column density values and their uncertainties , however , we experiment with many other fits . analyzing the lwrs and mdrs spectra",
    "independently provides some sense of the systematic uncertainties involved in the fitting process .",
    "we also experiment with different estimates for the continuum placement .",
    "particularly for the d  i lines , we also try fits without considering the h  i lines at all .",
    "this allows us to more simply extrapolate a continuum just over the d  i lines themselves rather than making the more uncertain extrapolation over both the d  i and h  i lines , which are partially blended for ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath35 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "there is significant potential for systematic error with regards to d  i since all the d  i lines are just blueward of h  i lines , which makes continuum placement tricky .",
    "the fact that photospheric he  ii and h  i absorption are centered at these locations also complicates matters @xcite .",
    "finally , we also experiment with various two - component fits .",
    "these fits all assume a weaker second component redward of the primary component , as suggested by the si  ii fit in figure  2 , but we experiment with different velocity separations and column density ratios for the two components .",
    "the column density ratio is typically assumed to be the same for all lines of all atomic species in order to limit the number of free parameters .",
    "we also typically assume that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 values are identical for both components .",
    "we do not think that the fuse or ghrs data have sufficient resolution to accurately derive t and @xmath31 at all , let alone for both components separately .",
    "nevertheless , we experimented with fits allowing t and @xmath31 to be different for the two components and our total column density measurements do not change significantly .",
    "the fit to the data shown in figure  4 is an example of one of the global two - component fits , although only the six strongest lyman lines are shown in the figure .",
    "this particular fit assumes a velocity separation of 17 km  s@xmath21 and a very large column density ratio of 250:1 for the two components , explaining why the second component ( dashed lines ) is only seen for the h  i lines and not the optically thin d  i lines .",
    "as described above , a two - gaussian lsf is a free parameter of our fits . in figure  5 , we show examples of lsfs that were derived for various fits , not only to the wd  1634 - 573 data but also to fuse observations of another white dwarf , wd  2211 - 495 , which are analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the solid lines are lsfs derived from fits to the lwrs data , and the dotted lines are lsfs from the mdrs data .",
    "there is significant scatter in the estimated lsf shape , which indicates the level of uncertainty in this average fuse lsf , and it should also be pointed out once again that the real fuse lsf will be wavelength dependent .",
    "there is no obvious systematic difference between the lwrs and mdrs profiles , and there are not any obvious systematic differences between the lsfs derived from the wd  1634 - 573 and wd  2211 - 495 data sets .",
    "the dashed line in figure  5 is the average of all these lsfs , which can be approximated by the sum of two gaussians with the following parameters : @xmath36 pix , @xmath37 pix , and @xmath38 for the first gaussian , and @xmath39 pix , @xmath40 pix , and @xmath41 for the second ( @xmath19=centroid position , @xmath42=full width at half - maximum , and @xmath34=amplitude ) .",
    "the width of this average lsf suggests a spectral resolution of @xmath43 .",
    "the fuse lsf has broad wings , which is the reason the flux in the saturated core of the broad h  i lyman absorption lines does not fall to zero ( see figs .  1 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "the prominence of the line wings of our derived lsfs is determined almost entirely from the lyman lines .",
    "when we fit the data without the h  i lines ( see above ) , the broad wings disappear since the remaining lower opacity line profiles are not nearly as sensitive to the far wings of the lsf .    in reality",
    ", the fuse lsf will vary with wavelength , so we tried fits with the lsf allowed to vary within the spectrum .",
    "these trials did not yield fit parameters statistically different from those obtained assuming an invariable lsf .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that there is not enough information within the data to accurately determine a wavelength dependent lsf , so our attempt to do so may not have fully accounted for systematic errors associated with the wavelength dependence of the true lsf .",
    "variability in the lsf could be at least partially responsible for the discrepancies in the fits to the h  i lines in figure  4 .",
    "@xcite present further , detailed discussion about the difficulties in estimating the lsf for fuse data .",
    "all of the various fits that we try using different continua , different data sets ( i.e. , lwrs or mdrs ) , and different types of multi - component fits are visually inspected to make sure the spectra are fitted reasonably well . after visibly poor quality fits are thrown out , we are left with a collection of fits that we can use to determine the column densities and their uncertainties . for each column density",
    ", we have from these fits a set of measured columns that lead to acceptable fits to the data .",
    "this set defines a range of acceptable values for that column density .",
    "we choose the center of that range as our best estimate for the column density and the half - width of the range as the estimated uncertainty .    for example , our set of @xmath44 values from various acceptable fits is [ 14.51 , 14.52 , 14.59 , 14.60 , 14.61 , 14.64 , 14.66 , 14.67 , 14.71 ] , where for the sake of brevity we have omitted repetition of identical @xmath44 measurements . from this set of numbers",
    ", we estimate @xmath45 since 14.61 is at the center of the range of values and 0.10 is the half - width of the range .",
    "uncertainties estimated in this manner are not statistical errors , but we consider them to be something like 2@xmath6 uncertainties in the sense of being roughly 95% confidence intervals",
    ". they certainly are more conservative than `` 1@xmath6 uncertainties '' since we do not throw out 32% of our acceptable fits before estimating the errors .",
    "the temperatures we find with our fits are in the @xmath46  k range and the nonthermal velocities are in the range @xmath47 km  s@xmath21 . however , as noted above the presence of multiple components complicates the interpretation of these quantities .",
    "as mentioned near the beginning of this section , we performed a second independent analysis of the data using a different technique .",
    "this technique uses a spectral fitting code called owens.f , developed by one of us ( m.  l. ) and the fuse french team .",
    "a thorough description of the use of this code can be found in @xcite , another of this series of papers on the first deuterium measurements with fuse , which describes the measurement of deuterium toward wd  2211 - 495 .",
    "the owens code performs global fits to many absorption lines simultaneously by @xmath48 minimization .",
    "all the data from different fuse channels and different observations are fitted simultaneously , allowing for redundant coverage of a given spectral line .",
    "the background continuum for each line , represented as a polynomial , is left as a free parameter of the fit .",
    "the width of the lsf is allowed to vary independently for each line to try to account for expected lsf variations with wavelength in the fuse spectra . only the optically thin lines are included in the fit in order to avoid systematic errors associated with the structure of the line of sight and incorrect knowledge of the lsf . uncertainties ( 2@xmath6 )",
    "are estimated from an analysis of @xmath49 contours ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit yielded a @xmath50 with 3076 degrees of freedom .    despite the differences between the two fitting procedures , the results are consistent , with overlapping error bars . the final column density measurements and 2@xmath6 uncertainties listed in table  4",
    "represent a synthesis of these two independent analyses , and are consistent with the results of both . we do not list a si  ii column density because of the possible blend with n  iii ( see above ) .",
    "the si  ii @xmath191260 line observed by hst / ghrs ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is saturated and therefore does not provide a precise column density , but the s  ii @xmath191259 line ( see fig .  2 ) and a weaker s  ii @xmath191253 line do provide a useful s  ii column density that we list in table  4 for completeness .",
    "because there are many d  i , n  i , and o  i lines of varying strengths , we believe our column density measurements for these species are quite accurate , with 2@xmath6 uncertainties of only 0.050.07 dex ( see table  4 ) .",
    "the uncertainty roughly doubles when we have only one or two unsaturated lines to work with , as is the case for p  ii , s  ii , ar  i , and fe  ii .",
    "when we have only saturated lines to work with , the uncertainties are much higher .",
    "thus , the h  i , c  ii , c  iii , and n  ii column densities have uncertainties in the 0.30.7 dex range .",
    "this problem with saturated lines exists for h  i despite there being many lines to work with , at least one of which ( h  i ly@xmath11 ) is at least partly out of the flat part of the curve of growth ( see above ) .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis suggests that fuse data can not be used to derive a precise h  i column density toward wd  1634 - 573",
    ". the situation will likely be better for higher column density lines of sight with at least ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath35 completely out of the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "however , @xcite express concern that undetected hot h  i components , such as the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption previously observed toward nearby cool stars @xcite , could potentially affect any measurement of h  i column densities from the lyman absorption lines , making it even harder to assess systematic errors for these analyses .    because our h  i measurement ( @xmath51 ) is not very precise",
    ", we must look elsewhere for an h  i measurement that we can use to compute an accurate d / h value for this line of sight .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath52 from their analysis of iue observations of the ly@xmath9 line .",
    "@xcite found @xmath53 from orfeus observations of the same h  i lyman lines that we have analyzed using fuse .",
    "our results are consistent with orfeus , but the error bars are large for both measurements .",
    "the most accurate measurement appears to be from euve observations of h  i lyman continuum absorption shortward of 912   . in a simultaneous analysis of both orfeus and euve data , which allowed both photospheric parameters ( e.g. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and the interstellar h  i column density to vary",
    ", @xcite finds @xmath56 @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "see also @xcite for more details on the photospheric analysis . based on this h  i value and our d  i measurement ( @xmath58 ) , which are both quoted with 2@xmath6 uncertainties , we find that @xmath1 toward wd  1634 - 573 .",
    "this value is consistent with the lic value of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the ar  i / h  i abundance ratio , @xmath59 , is close to the b star ar abundance of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of @xcite , who found significantly lower ar  i / h  i ratios toward 3 stars ( @xmath61 ) , which they attributed to a higher ionization state of ar compared with h due to the high photoionization cross section of ar .",
    "this provides important evidence that the lism is in fact in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "perhaps the wd  1634 - 573 line of sight is more shielded from photoionization , allowing the ionization state of ar to be closer to that of h. the apparently high n  ii / n  i ratio ( see table  4 ) might suggest otherwise , although uncertainty in the n  ii column is large .",
    "due to charge exchange interactions , the ionization states of d , h , and o are closely coupled .",
    "this means that the total d / o gas phase abundance ratio is well approximated by the d  i / o  i ratio .",
    "charge exchange is also important between d , h , and n , although to a lesser extent , so @xmath62 .",
    "our measurements of d  i , o  i , and n  i in table  4 yield @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( 2@xmath6 errors ) .    these ratios can be used to estimate d / h when we multiply them by previously measured values for the gas phase o / h and n / h ratios in the ism .",
    "@xcite used ghrs observations of the o  i @xmath191356 lines of 13 ob stars that are more distant ( @xmath63 pc ) than wd  1634 - 573 to estimate @xmath64 , with no evidence for variation within the ism . note that we have increased the published o / h value by 7.5% to account for a revised f value for o  i @xmath191356 suggested by @xcite",
    "likewise , @xcite find @xmath65 toward a similar sample of 7 ob stars , also with no evidence of variation .",
    "note that these measurements of o / h and n / h only consider the column densities of o  i , n  i , h  i , and h@xmath66 , and do not take into account the column densities of the ionized species o  ii , n  ii , or h  ii . since @xmath67 is a good approximation , the o / h value should be relatively free from inaccuracies induced by ionization state issues , but the n / h value is potentially susceptible to differences and variations in the relative ionization states of n and h ( see above ) .",
    "note also that the cited uncertainties in o / h and n / h are 1@xmath6 standard deviations of the mean rather than simple standard deviations about the mean , meaning that the scatter of the individual o / h and n / h measurements is actually larger than suggested by the quoted uncertainties , potentially allowing for a larger variation of o / h and n / h within the ism than is suggested by those uncertainties .    in any case ,",
    "multiplying our d  i / o  i measurement with the @xcite mean o / h value results in @xmath4 , while multiplying our d  i / n  i measurement with the @xcite mean n / h value results in @xmath5 ( 2@xmath6 errors ) .",
    "these two d / h values do not overlap , suggesting that the either the o  i / h",
    "i and/or n  i / h  i ratio toward wd  1634 - 573 is not consistent with the @xcite mean o / h and n / h values .",
    "as suggested above , the n  i / h  i ratio is more suspect due to the possibility of variations in the relative ionization states of n and h within the lism .",
    "furthermore , the n  i / h  i value measured toward g191-b2b is clearly lower than the @xcite n / h value @xcite . a more extensive discussion of these issues is provided by @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath7 measurement is a bit lower than the accepted lic value of @xmath13 .",
    "we have used fuse observations to measure column densities for many atomic species toward the white dwarf wd  1634 - 573 , which are listed in table  4 .",
    "these measurements and uncertainties represent a synthesis between the results of two separate , independent analyses .",
    "we feel the use of independent analyses is the best possible method for assessing the magnitude of systematic errors in this type of study . of particular significance",
    "is the measurement of d  i , because of the importance of the deuterium - to - hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio for cosmology and studies of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we find that a previously published value for the h  i column density from euve is more precise than what we can measure from fuse , although our fuse measurement is consistent with the euve result .",
    "combining the fuse d  i column density with the euve h  i column density yields @xmath1 ( 2@xmath6 uncertainty ) , consistent with the lic value of @xmath13 @xcite . combining our wd1634 - 573 measurement with others in this first series of fuse d / h measurements in the lism",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath68 within the local bubble , which extends @xmath69  pc from the sun in most directions .",
    "there is no evidence for variation within the local bubble , but the dispersion of galactic d / h measurements increases significantly if imaps and _ copernicus _ measurements of longer lines of sight are considered .    we can also estimate d / h for wd1634 - 573 by computing d  i / o  i and d  i / n  i ratios from our fuse measurements , and multiplying them by mean gas phase o / h and n / h ratios derived for the ism by @xcite . however , these yield inconsistent d / h values , suggesting that either o  i / h  i and/or n  i / h  i toward wd  1634 - 573 is not consistent with the o / h and n / h ratios from @xcite .",
    "the n  i / h  i value is the more likely culprit since the ionization state of n is more likely to vary relative to h than is the case for o , and the work of @xcite and @xcite shows that n  i / h  i toward g191-b2b is significantly lower than the @xcite n / h value .",
    "the d / h value computed from d  i / o  i and o / h , @xmath4 , is slightly lower than the lic value quoted above .",
    "we note that the published o / h and n / h values for the ism are mean values derived from observations of stars located much farther away than wd  1634 - 573 ( @xmath0  pc ) and thus may not be representative of gas in the nearby ism .",
    "the importance of fuse d  i / o  i and d  i / n  i measurements is discussed further by @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank r.  napiwotzki for information about his euve and orfeus studies of wd  1634 - 573 , and we would like to thank j.  c.howk and d.  york for useful comments on the manuscript . this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa fuse mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
