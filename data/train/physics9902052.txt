    "there is a great deal of current interest in how neural systems , both artificial and natural , can use top - down feedback to modulate input processing . here",
    "we propose a minimal model for an olfactory system in which feedback enables it to perform an essential task  olfactory segmentation .",
    "most olfactory systems need to detect , recognize , and segment odor objects .",
    "segmentation is necessary because different odors give overlapping activity patterns on odor receptor neurons , of which there are hundreds of types @xcite , and each has a broad spectrum of response to different odor molecules @xcite .",
    "different odor objects seldom enter the environment in the same sniff cycle , but they often stay together in the environment afterwards .",
    "humans usually can not identify the individual odor objects in mixtures @xcite , although they easily perceive an incoming odor superposed on pre - existing ones .",
    "our model performs odor segmentation temporally : first one odor is detected and encoded by the olfactory bulb and recognized by the associative memory circuits of the olfactory cortex .",
    "then the cortex gives an odor - specific feedback to the bulb to inhibit the response or adapt to this odor , so that a superposed second odor arriving later can be detected and recognized with undiminished sensitivity while the sensitivity to the pre - existing odor is reduced , as observed psychophysically @xcite .",
    "the stimulus - specific feedback makes odor adaptation an intelligent computational strategy , unlike simple fatigue , which is not sufficient for odor segmentation .",
    "our model displays the oscillatory neural activities in the bulb and cortex as observed physiologically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , odor cross - adaptation  the suppression and distortion of odor perception immediately after an exposure to another odor  as observed psychophysically @xcite , is a consequence of this model .",
    "our model ( fig .",
    "1 ) describes the essential elements of primary olfactory neural circuitry : the olfactory bulb , the olfactory cortex , and feedforward and feedback coupling between them .",
    "the formal neurons in our system model the collective activity of local populations of real neurons .",
    "the synaptic architecture is consistent with the known physiology and anatomy of the olfactory system in most mammalian species @xcite .",
    "( 200 , 200 ) ( -155 , -730 )    our bulb model contains interacting excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells , with membrane potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and firing rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . the odor input @xmath4 drives the dynamics +   + @xmath5 +   + where @xmath6 and @xmath7 model the decays to resting potentials , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the synaptic connections from the granule to mitral cells and vice versa , and vector @xmath10 ( components @xmath11 ) the feedback signal from the cortex to the granule cells .",
    "slowly varying input @xmath12 and @xmath10 adiabatically determine the fixed or equilibrium point @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the equations .",
    "neural activities oscillates around this equilibrium as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an eigenvector of @xmath17 with eigenvalue @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "spontaneous oscillation occurs if @xmath21 ; then the fastest - growing mode , call it @xmath22 , dominates the output and the entire bulb oscillates with a single frequency @xmath23 , and the oscillation amplitudes and phases is approximately the complex vector @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the bulb encodes the input via the steps : ( 1 ) the input @xmath12 determines @xmath25 , which in turn ( 2 ) determines the matrix @xmath26 , which then ( 3 ) determines whether the bulb will give spontanous oscillatory outputs and , if it does , the oscillation pattern @xmath22 and frequency @xmath27",
    ".    the mitral cell outputs @xmath2 are transformed to an effective input @xmath28 to the excitatory ( pyramidal ) cells of the cortex by ( 1 ) a convergent - divergent bulbar - cortex connection matrix and ( 2 ) an effective high - pass filtering via feedforward interneurons in the cortex .",
    "our cortical model is structurally similar to that of the bulb .",
    "we focus only on the upper layer pyramidal cells and feedback interneurons : +   + @xmath29 , +   + where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 correspond to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the bulb .",
    "@xmath36 is global excitatory - to - excitatory connections , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are local synaptic couplings .    carrying out the same kind of linearization around the fixed point @xmath39 as in the bulb , we obtain a system of driven coupled oscillators .",
    "with appropriate cell nonlinearities and overall scale of the synaptic connections , the system does not oscillate spontaneously , nor does it respond much to random or irrelevant inputs .",
    "however , the cortex will resonate vigorously when the driving oscillatory force @xmath40 matches one of intrinsic oscillatory modes @xmath41 in frequency and patterns amplitudes and phases .",
    "these intrinsic modes @xmath41 for @xmath42 , are memory items in an associative memory system @xcite , and can be stored in the synapses @xmath36 and @xmath32 in a generalized hebb - hopfield fashion    @xmath43    fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] shows that 3 odors a , b , and c all evoke bulbar oscillatory responses .",
    "however only odor a and b are stored in the in the cortical synapses ; hence the cortical oscillatory response to odor c is almost nonexistent .",
    "( 200 , 250 ) ( -105 , -590 )    it was shown in @xcite that a suitable dc feedback signal to suppress the odor - specific activity in the bulb is @xmath44 .",
    "somehow , this feedback should be constructed from the cortical outputs that contains the odor information .",
    "we do not know how this is done in cortical circuitry , so we treat this part of the problem phenomenologically .",
    "first , we transform the ac signal in the pyramidal cell output @xmath45 to a slow dc like signal by thresholding @xmath45 and then passing it through two successive very slow leaky integrators .",
    "one can then easily construct a synaptic connection matrix to transform this signal to the desired feedback signal for the odor input that evoked the cortical output @xmath46 in the past sniffs .",
    "feedback signal slowly builds up and the adaptation to odor a becomes effective at the second sniff ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feedbacka3b1]a ) , and the system responds to odor a+b at the third sniff in a way as if only odor b were present ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feedbacka3b1]b ) , achieving odor adaptation and segmentation consistent with human behavior .",
    "quantitative analysis confirms that the response to the segmented odor b in the third sniff is about 98% similar to that of response to odor b alone .",
    "simulations show that odor adaptation eventually achieves an equilibrium level when insignificant residual responses to background odors maintain a steady feedback signal .",
    "a consequence of the model is olfactory cross - adaptation , when the background odor a is suddenly removed and odor b is presented . the feedback signal or background adaptation to odor a persists for a while and significantly distorts ( and suppresses ) the response to , and thus the percept of , odor b ( fig . (",
    "[ fig : feedbacka3b1]c ) ) , as observed psychophysically @xcite .",
    "( 200 , 250 ) ( -105 , -590 )",
    "we have augmented the bulb model developed in earlier work by one of us @xcite with a model of the pyriform cortex and with feedforward and feedback connections between it and the bulb .",
    "it is a minimal computational model for how an olfactory system can detect , recognize and segment odors . as far as we know , this is the simplest system consistent with anatomical knowledge that can perform these three tasks , all of which are fundamental for olfaction . our model does not deal with other computational tasks , such as hierachical catagorization of odors @xcite .",
    "the resonant associative memory recognition mechanism and the slow feedback to the granule ( inhibitory ) neurons of the bulb are essential parts of our model , but many of the details of the present treatment are not .",
    "for example , the slow feedback signal could be implemented by many other mechanisms , but it must be slow . these essential features are necessary in order that the model be consistent with the observed phenomenology of the olfactory system ."
