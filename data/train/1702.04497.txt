    "heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite bounds the limit of measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables , which reveals a fundamental difference between the classical and quantum mechanics . after intensive studies of the principle in terms of standard deviations of the measurements",
    ", entropies have stood out to be a natural and important alternative formulation of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the importance of entropic uncertainty relations is solidified by a variety of applications , ranging from entanglement witnessing to quantum cryptography .",
    "the first entropic uncertainty relation of observables with finite spectrum was given by deutsch @xcite and then improved by maassen and uffink @xcite , who gave the celebrated mu bound : if two incompatible measurements @xmath0 and @xmath1 are chosen on the particle @xmath2 , then the uncertainty is bounded below by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the _ shannon entropy _ of the probability distribution induced by measurement @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the largest overlap between the observables . on the other hand ,",
    "a mixed state is expected to have more uncertainty , as ( [ mu ] ) can be reinforced by adding the complementary term of the _ von neumann entropy _ @xmath7 : @xmath8 the entropy @xmath9 measures the amount of uncertainty induced by the mixing status of the state @xmath10 : if the state is pure , then @xmath11 , and if the state is a mixed state , then @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the corresponding bound ( [ mumix ] ) is stronger than ( [ mu ] ) even though there is no auxiliary quantum system such as a quantum memory .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the classical part @xmath14 and call @xmath9 the mixing part of the bound for the entropic uncertainty relation since it measures the mixing status of the particle .",
    "most of the bounds for entropic uncertainty relations in the absence of quantum memory contain two parts : ( ) the classical part @xmath15 , for instance , maassen and uffink s bound @xcite , coles and piani s bound @xcite , or our recent bound @xcite ; ( ) the mixing part @xmath9 , which describes the information pertaining to the mixing status of the particle @xmath10 .",
    "we note that both the kaniewski - tomamichel - wehner bound @xcite based on effective anti - commutator and the direct - sum majorization bound @xcite only involve with the classical part and have no mixing parts . for more details , see sec . . obviously ,",
    "not all the bounds @xmath15 can be generalized to the case with quantum memory by simply adding an extra term @xmath16 .",
    "therefore it is an interesting problem to extend the entropic uncertainty relations in the absence of quantum memory to those with quantum memory .    in this paper",
    ", we will solve the extension problem by answering three questions : ( ) can the uncertainty relation in the absence of quantum memory be generalized to the case with quantum side information ?",
    "( ) are there other indices besides @xmath16 to quantify the amount of entanglement between the measured particle and quantum memory ?",
    "( ) can two pairs of observables sharing the same overlaps between bases have different entropic uncertainty relations ? besides answering these questions in detail we will give a couple of strong entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory .",
    "strengthening the bound for the entropic uncertainty relation is an interesting problem arising from quantum theory .",
    "one of the main issues in this direction is how to extend the entropic uncertainty relation to allow for quantum side information .",
    "several approaches have been devoted to seek for stronger bounds for the entropic uncertainty relations ( e.g. majorization - based uncertainty relations , direct - sum majorization relations , uncertainty relations based on effective anti - commutators and so on ) .",
    "however it is still unclear how to implement these methods to allow for quantum side information . in this section",
    "we will show that it is possible to generalize all uncertainty relations for the sum of shannon entropies to allow for quantum side information by using the _ holevo inequality_.    before analyzing our main techniques and results , let us first discuss the modern formulation of the uncertainty principle , the so - called _ guessing game _",
    "( also known as the _ uncertainty game _ ) , which highlights its relevance with quantum cryptography .",
    "we can imagine there are two observers , alice and bob .",
    "before the game initiates , they agree on two measurements @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the guessing game proceeds as follows : bob , can prepare an arbitrary state @xmath10 which he will send to alice .",
    "alice then randomly chooses to perform one of measurements and records the outcome . after telling bob the choices of her measurements",
    ", bob can win the game if he correctly guesses alice s outcome .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty principle tells us that bob can not win the game under the condition of incompatible measurements .",
    "what if bob prepares a bipartite quantum state @xmath19 and sends only the particle @xmath2 to alice ?",
    "equivalently , what if bob has nontrivial _ quantum side information _ about alice s system ? or , what if all information bob has on the particle @xmath10 is beyond the classical description , for example , information on its density matrix ?",
    "@xcite answered these questions and generalized the uncertainty relation ( [ mu ] ) to the case with an auxiliary quantum system @xmath20 known as quantum memory .",
    "it is now possible for bob to experience no uncertainty at all when equipped himself with quantum memory , and bob s uncertainty about the result of measurements on alice s system is bounded by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conditional entropy with @xmath23 ( similarly for @xmath24 ) , and the term @xmath25 is related to the entanglement between the measured particle @xmath2 and the quantum memory @xmath20 .    on the other hand , entropic uncertainty relation without quantum memory",
    "can be roughly divided into two categories . if the measure of incompatibility is effective ( state - dependent ) , one can follow kaniewski , tomamichel and wehner s approach to obtain bounds ( e.g. @xmath26 @xcite ) based on effective anticommutators",
    ". otherwise one can derive strong bounds ( e.g. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite ) based on majorization , or bounds ( e.g. @xmath32 @xcite ) constructed by the monotonicity of relative entropy under quantum channels . note that maassen and uffink s bound @xmath14 @xcite , coles and piani s bound @xmath32 @xcite are still valid in the presence of quantum memory by adding an extra term @xmath16 .",
    "all these bounds can be generalized to allow for quantum side information .",

    "the existence of quantum memory translates into additional information on the uncertainty relation .",
    "we introduce the notion of _ quantum measure _ to describe the relationship between measured particle and quantum memory .",
    "there are two types of quantum measures .",
    "the first type of quantum measure on entropic uncertainty relations is the mutual information between measured particle @xmath2 and quantum memory @xmath20 , which comes from the conditional von neumann entropy @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the _",
    "first quantum measure _ , as @xmath9 counts for the mixing level for measured particle @xmath2 .",
    "then the bounds for the entropic uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory consist of three parts : the bound @xmath15 for the sum of shannon entropies , the _ mixing part _ @xmath9 and the first quantum measure @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the second largest entry of the matrix @xmath67 .    a more natural and less restrictive _ quantum measure _ is @xmath68 discussed in sec . .",
    "let @xmath69 be the _",
    "second quantum measure _ , then we can generalize all the bounds for the sum of shannon entropies to allow for quantum side information .",
    "namely we have @xmath70    clearly , both maassen and uffink s bound @xmath14 and coles and piani s bound @xmath32 are valid with or without quantum side information , with the mixing part @xmath9 in the former case or the conditional entropy @xmath16 in the latter .",
    "mathematically , the relation says that @xmath71 where @xmath72 or @xmath32 .",
    "the term @xmath73 will be referred as the _ consistent classical part _ of the bound for the entropic uncertainty relation . in place of @xmath14 and @xmath32 in , we have recently given a new consistent classical part @xmath20 , which is a tighter bound depending on all overlaps between incompatible observables @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath76-th largest overlap among @xmath77 : @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the @xmath80-th element of majorization bound for measurements @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in general the bound @xmath20 is always tighter than @xmath32 , except possibly when two orthonormal bases are mutually unbiased .    [",

    "here we have used a weighted sum of quantum measures similar to @xcite . note that the weight is applied on the quantum measures instead of the uncertainty relations . through this simple process",
    ", we can always get a better lower bound without worrying which quantum measure is tighter than the other . aside from its own significance , the new quantum measure @xmath84 is expected to be useful for future quantum technologies such as entanglement witnessing .",
    "the quantum measure @xmath85 has two desirable features . first , with the help of the _ second quantum measure _ we can extend all previous bounds of the entropic sum ( shannon entropy ) to allow for the quantum side information without restrictive constraints .",
    "the comparison of some of the existing results is given together with their extensions in the presence of quantum side information in table .",
    "1 . second , @xmath85 can sometimes outperform @xmath62 to give tighter bounds for the entropic uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory . for more details , see sec . .",
    "third , by taking the maximum over @xmath86 and zero , we derive that @xmath87 is another bound , i.e. @xmath88 , which coincides with the main quantity used in the recent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq ( 12 ) ) for a strong uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory .",
    "we point it out that our result is more general than simply using @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , @xmath90 is tighter than the outcomes from @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have given a detailed and rigourous proof on the lower bound .",
    "let us consider two pairs of incompatible observables @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 with the same overlaps @xmath77 . then the bounds for the shannon entropic sum @xmath46 on measured particle @xmath2 will coincide with that of @xmath93 , since their bounds only depend on the overlaps @xmath77",
    ". if there is quantum memory @xmath20 present , the same relation holds for the bounds with the first quantum measure @xmath94 , since their bounds also depend only on @xmath77 and @xmath16 .",

    "the green curve is the entropic bound @xmath105 , the blue curve is the entropic bound @xmath106 , the orange curve is the entropic bound @xmath107 and the red curve is the entropic bound @xmath108.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    set @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "( [ d ] ) ) .",
    "if there is no quantum memory , the entropic uncertainty relations are obtained as @xmath114 where the bounds are the same due to identical overlaps between the bases . in the presence of quantum memory , using the _ first quantum measure _ @xmath62 as the extra term to describe the amount of correlations between measured particle and quantum memory , we have that @xmath115 so their bounds coincide again . finally , choosing the _ second quantum measure _",
    "@xmath85 for the correlations between measured particle and quantum memory , we derive that @xmath116 and this time their bounds are different from each other .",
    "therefore when the measured particle and quantum memory are entangled , the uncertainty is decreased through suitable incompatible observables .",
    "since all the bounds contain @xmath117 , we only need to compare @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 for two pairs of measurements .    in fig .",
    "3 , the comparison is done for @xmath105 , @xmath107 , @xmath106 and @xmath108 , which shows how the _ second quantum measure _ works for selected pairs of incompatible observables . the bound @xmath106 ( with the _ second quantum measure _ )",
    "provides the best estimation for the entropic sum in the presence of quantum memory , while the bound @xmath107 ( with the _ first quantum measure _ ) gives a weaker approximation .",
    "the _ second quantum measure _ does not always outperform the _ first quantum measure _",
    ", since @xmath108 is typically worse than @xmath107 .",
    "however , comparing the bound @xmath106 with @xmath108 , we find that the uncertainty from measurements can be weaken by selecting appropriate measurements even if each pair of incompatible observables shares the same overlaps .",
    "to illustrate improvement of the bound in the presence of quantum memory , we compare the bound based on the _ second quantum measure _ with that based on the _ first quantum measure_. as a first step , choose the initial state as _ werner state _",
    "@xmath118 with @xmath97 , and @xmath119 the _ bell state_. take @xmath120 , @xmath121 ; @xmath122 , @xmath123 with @xmath124 , then the difference between the bound with _ second quantum measure _ and",
    "the bound with the _ first quantum measure _ is illustrated in fig .",
    "the nonnegativity of the surface shows that our newly constructed bound with the _ second quantum measure _ can outperform the bound with the _ first quantum measure _ everywhere in this case .     and the bound of entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory with the _ first quantum measure _ @xmath62.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    using quantum measures we have shown that it is possible to reduce the total uncertainties coming from incompatibility of the observables by an appropriate choice . however , when the measured particle and quantum memory are maximally entangled , both the first and second _ quantum measure _ equal to @xmath125 .",
    "we sketch a proof of this statement in appendix a.",
    "in this section , we derive several strong entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory by utilizing both the relevant bounds for the sum of shannon entropies and optimal selection of quantum measures . recall that the bounds of entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory contain three ingredients : the classical part @xmath15 , the mixing part @xmath9 ( which is not necessarily existent , e.g. , the majorization bounds @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite ) , and the quantum measures @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",

    "@xmath73 is valid with both quantum measures @xmath126 , therefore for @xmath129 @xmath130    as the bound @xmath20 in ( [ d ] ) is the tightest , so the strongest lower bound for the entropic sum in the presence of quantum memory with _",
    "consistent classical part _ is given by @xmath131    without the help of the consistent classical part , all other classical parts @xmath15 can be estimated in the same way .",
    "@xmath132 note that for @xmath133 or @xmath54 , there is no mixing part @xmath9 on the right - hand side of ( [ e : secondindex ] ) .",
    "taking the maximum over all possible @xmath15 s we obtain a lower bound @xmath134    clearly both the lower bounds @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be combined into a hybrid bound for the uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory : @xmath137 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given by ( [ e : cc ] ) and ( [ e : secondindex ] ) respectively .",
    "we now extend our results to the general case of @xmath138-partite particles ( @xmath139 ) with @xmath140 incompatible observables ( @xmath141 ) .",
