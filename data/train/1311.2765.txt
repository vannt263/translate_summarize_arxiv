    "in a 2001 paper ,  @xcite kitaev discovered the one - dimensional topological superconductor ( 1dtsc )  a one - dimensional proximity induced @xmath0-wave superconductor hosting a single majorana quasi particle ( mqp ) at each of its ends .",
    "more recently , experimentally feasible realizations of the 1dtsc phase have been proposed @xcite in semiconducting nanowires in proximity to an @xmath1-wave superconductor . in these settings ,",
    "the interplay of rashba spin - orbit coupling and a magnetic field induced zeeman splitting in the nanowire gives rise to an effective @xmath0-wave pairing . by now , several groups have reported first experimental signatures of mqps in insb nanowires .",
    "@xcite besides the fundamental interest attached to the experimental discovery of majorana fermions in nature , mqps as realized in 1dtsc also have intriguing features relating to various aspects of fundamental quantum physics : on the one hand the non - abelian anyonic nature of mqps shows great promise for topological quantum information processing architectures .",
    "@xcite on the other hand the delocalized pair of mqps at the ends of a 1dtsc can be viewed as a single ordinary ( spinless dirac ) fermionic zero mode leading to electron teleportation mechanisms ,  @xcite i.e. , coherent long - range quantum effects . in a hybrid system of a 1dtsc and two single - level quantum dots ,",
    "ground state entanglement of the occupation number of the quantum dots has been reported in ref .  .",
    "the understanding of genuine quantum effects on macroscopic lengthscales is one of the main motivations to study nano - electromechanical systems  @xcite and nano - optomechanical systems .",
    "@xcite in recent years , decisive progress towards cooling nanomechanical resonators to the ground state has been reported .",
    "@xcite however , long distance entanglement of nanomechanical systems which would be another experimental hallmark in fundamental quantum physics has not been achieved yet although a variety of theoretical proposals have been made .",
    "@xcite in the interest of quantum coherence , different interaction mechanisms between spatially separated systems have been suggested ranging from coupling to a common optical mode @xcite to exploiting the large coherence length of a bose einstein condensate @xcite and a cooper - pair condensate ,  @xcite respectively .",

    "in this work , we bridge the research fields of topological superconductivity and entanglement in nanomechanical systems by proposing a mechanism to entangle two nano - electromechanical oscillators ( nemos ) . more concretely ,",
    "we demonstrate that the electron teleportation mechanism reported in ref",
    ".   can lead to an effective superexchange coupling of two distant nemos located in the vicinity of the opposite ends of a mesoscopic 1dtsc .",
    "the combination of electron - phonon coupling on the nemos and a finite coulomb charging energy @xmath4 on the 1dtsc are shown to be the crucial ingredients for achieving long range entanglement in the proposed setup .",
    "the teleportation mechanism guarantees coherence at length scales that significantly exceed those of the superconducting condensate wave function . in the proposed setup ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) entanglement between two distant conducting nemos can be generated by simply driving a current through the device . using a non - markovian master equation approach",
    ", we demonstrate that for nemos in their ground states , switching on a tunneling current induces entanglement that persists over many oscillator periods . in the markovian limit ,",
    "we derive a lindblad master equation which provides an intuitive understanding of how number states of the nemos are dynamically entangled by the superexchange coupling via the 1dtsc .",
    "we will now show how an effective coupling between two nemos can be generated via an electron teleportation mechanism involving the mqps located at the ends of a 1dtsc . the proposed setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] and is modeled by the following hamiltonian ( we put @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath7 @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 describes the two nemos denoted by @xmath13   with effective mass @xmath14 , frequency @xmath15 , and position and momentum operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath18  and @xmath19 .",
    "the conducting nemos act as two independent normal metal leads which are characterized by the hamiltonians @xmath20 and which are held at the chemical potentials @xmath5 . the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath21   from a normal metal lead into a 1dtsc without charging energy can be written as  @xcite @xmath22 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in general , the tunneling amplitudes @xmath23 have an exponential dependence on the displacement of the nemos , i.e. , @xmath24 . as the oscillation amplitude is assumed to be small",
    "compared to the mean distance between the edge of the 1dtsc and the nemo , we approximate @xmath23 to depend linearly on the oscillator displacement : @xmath25 . such a tunneling gap between a suspended gold beam and an electronic reservoir was realized in ref .  .",
    "other possibilities include , for instance , replacing the suspended metallic beam by a vibrating metallic tip or by a shuttle - like device .",
    "@xcite as yet another possibility to achieve such a coupling , the suspended point contacts could be replaced by an electrostatically gated connection to the 1dtsc that is modulated piezoelectrically or capacitively by the nemo .",
    "the left ( @xmath26 ) and right ( @xmath27 ) mqp satisfy @xmath28 and can be expressed as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , of a single spinless dirac fermion that is delocalized over the two ends of the 1dtsc .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : mo2 ] ) contains so called anomalous terms which break particle number conservation in the mean field picture of superconductivity as they microscopically involve the creation or annihilation of a cooper pair which is not explicitly accounted for at that level of description . in a 1dtsc with zero charging energy @xmath33 , the nemos independently couple locally to the two ends of the 1dtsc and the effective coupling necessary for entangling the oscillators is absent .",
    "however , the situation is different in a mesoscopic superconductor with a finite charging energy @xmath34  which gives rise to an explicit dependence of the energy on the number of electrons .",
    "hence , one has to go beyond the effective description of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mo2 ] ) and explicitly keep track of the change in the number of cooper pairs in the condensate during anomalous tunneling processes .",
    "the gate voltage @xmath2  is assumed to be adjusted such that the number of cooper pairs @xmath35   in the ground state of the 1dtsc is @xmath36  and the occupation number @xmath37  of the delocalized fermionic bound state is zero .",
    "the charging hamiltonian @xmath38 then reads @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to point out that @xmath40  as appearing in @xmath41 effectively couples the two mqps @xmath42  and @xmath43  even if the direct overlap of the two bound state wave functions is negligible .",
    "this coupling is crucial for the electron teleportation mechanisms as it prevents the dynamical independence of the two mqps .",
    "we would like to focus on the parameter regime @xmath44 . in this limit ,",
    "non - local tunneling processes involving continuum states of the superconductor ( e.g. crossed andreev reflection or electron cotunneling ) are suppressed . moreover , in this scenario , there are no resonant levels in the superconductor for first - order tunneling processes .",
    "however , second - order cotunneling processes via virtual states with energies on the order of @xmath45  are allowed and lead to an effective superexchange coupling between the nemos as we will derive now .",
    "we neglect processes containing intermediate states with two or more excess electrons on the superconductor which are suppressed by an energy denominator of at least @xmath46  and are hence less relevant .",
    "this approximation excludes all terms where an extra cooper pair is created .",
    "the only anomalous second order tunneling process which is then allowed is the anomalous cotunneling depicted in fig .",

    "that way , we obtain an effective direct tunneling hamiltonian between the left and the right lead containing the leading second order cotunneling processes in the original tunnel coupling eq .",

    "( [ eqn : mo4 ] ) also contains an effective direct coupling between the nemos .",
    "this formally mimics the superexchange coupling which could also be achieved using a single quantum dot with a finite charging energy .",
    "however , we would like to stress two conceptual advantages of the electron teleportation - induced superexchange coupling .",
    "first , it guarantees phase coherent coupling between the nemos over distances where the confinement induced level spacing on a quantum dot would become very small .",
    "second , the tunneling density of states associated with the delocalized fermion @xmath31  in our setting is spatially strongly peaked around the interface between the nemo and the 1dtsc . in a large single level quantum dot in contrast , the same spectral weight would be smeared out all over the `` bulk '' of the dot . in the following , we will demonstrate how this teleportation - induced superexchange coupling can be employed to generate entanglement between the oscillators over distances which are not limited by the coherence length of the superconducting condensate .",
    "as shown above ( see eq . ( [ eqn : mo4 ] ) ) , tunnel coupling two nemos to a 1dtsc leads to an effective direct coupling between the nemos .",
    "therefore , we expect the generation of entanglement in the bipartite continuous variable system consisting of the two nemos .",
    "we study the time evolution of entanglement between the two nemos using the logarithmic negativity as an entanglement measure : @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath56 is the partial transpose of the state of the bipartite system . for a gaussian state ,",

    ", we see that lower voltages lead to a higher logarithmic negativity",
    ". this can be interpreted by recognizing that the bias voltage is similar to an effective temperature of the leads and thereby leads to decoherence . as a first result , we conclude that an effective interaction mediated by an electron teleportation mechanism involving mqps leads to the generation of entanglement of two distant nemos .",

    "it is not possible to excite any of the nemos by the applied bias voltage .",
    "this allows us to employ the rotating wave approximation , i.e. , excitations can only be interchanged between the two nemos . in the low - bias limit and",

    "@xmath87 is the density of states in lead @xmath88 which we assume as constant in the relevant energy window .",
    "if other dissipation channels such as an additional bosonic heat bath are absent , the steady state of the system ( @xmath89 = 0 $ ] ) is not unique .",

    "the degree of entanglement of @xmath96 is readily quantified by calculating @xmath97 . in the presence of a finite temperature heat bath , sectors of different particle number will start to couple .",

    "the rates of the entanglement generating and destroying processes ( characterized by an independent rate determined by the microscopic environment of the nemos ) are governed by their respective liouvillian gaps , for details we also refer to ref .  .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that entanglement between two distant nemos can be achieved by tunnel coupling of the nemos to two mqps residing at the ends of a 1dtsc . a finite charging energy on the 1dtsc leads to an effective superexchange coupling between the nemos via the non - local mqps .",

    "we briefly want to elaborate on the conceptual difference between our work and ref .  , where the non - local nature of a pair of mqps was exploited to create a charge - entangled ground state of two single level quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime . on the contrary , in our proposal ,",
    "the electron charge degrees of freedom are in fact only used to generate an effective superexchange coupling between two rather _ macroscopic mechanical degrees of freedom_. in our setting , entanglement is not a ground state property of a closed system but is dynamically generated by driving a current between the two metallic leads . remarkably",
    ", the thermalization ( decoherence ) of the electrons after their tunneling into these reservoirs does not affect the coherence times of the entangled nemos .",
    "our analysis relies crucially on the hierarchy @xmath100  of the involved energy scales .",

    "for an @xmath101 wire proximity coupled to a @xmath102 superconductor , experimental data reported in ref .   indicate an induced gap on the order of @xmath103 . by varying the size of the superconductor , the charging energy @xmath34 can be adjusted . here",
