    "this is the third part of our eight presentations in which we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems .",
    "this is a continuation of our results from [ 1]-[8 ] , which is based on our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems  general , with additional structures ( hamiltonian , symplectic or quasicomplex ) , chaotic , quasiclassical , quantum , which are considered in the framework of local ( nonlinear ) fourier analysis , or wavelet analysis .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases . in this part",
    "we consider effects of insertion devices ( section 2 ) on beam dynamics . in section 3",
    "we consider generalization of our variational approach for the case of variable coefficients . in section 4",
    "we consider more powerful variational approach which is based on ideas of para - products and approximation for multiresolution approach , which gives us possibility for computations in each scale separately .",
    "assuming a sinusoidal field variation , we may consider according to [ 9 ] the analytical treatment of the effects of insertion devices on beam dynamics .",
    "one of the major detrimental aspects of the installation of insertion devices is the resulting reduction of dynamic aperture .",
    "introduction of non - linearities leads to enhancement of the amplitude - dependent tune shifts and distortion of phase space .",
    "the nonlinear fields will produce significant effects at large betatron amplitudes .",
    "the components of the insertion device magnetic field used for the derivation of equations of motion are as follows : @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the period length of the insertion device , @xmath3 is its magnetic field , @xmath4 is the radius of the curvature in the field @xmath3 . after a canonical transformation to change to betatron variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is averaged over the period of the insertion device and hyperbolic functions are expanded to the fourth order in @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or arbitrary order ) .",
    "then we have the following hamiltonian : @xmath7+\\frac{1}{4k^2\\rho^2}[k_x^2x^2+k_y^2y^2]\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{12k^2\\rho^2}[k_x^4x^4+k_y^4y^4 + 3k_x^2k^2x^2y^2]\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\sin(ks)}{2k\\rho}[p_x(k_x^2x^2+k_y^2y^2)-2k_xp_yxy]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have in this case also nonlinear ( polynomial with degree 3 ) dynamical system with variable ( periodic ) coefficients . as related cases we may consider wiggler and undulator magnets .",
    "we have in horizontal @xmath8 plane the following equations @xmath9 where magnetic field has periodic dependence on @xmath10 and hyperbolic on @xmath11 .",
    "in the case when we have situation when our problem is described by a system of nonlinear ( polynomial)differential equations , we need to consider extension of our previous approach which can take into account any type of variable coefficients ( periodic , regular or singular ) .",
    "we can produce such approach if we add in our construction additional refinement equation , which encoded all information about variable coefficients [ 10 ] . according to our variational approach",
    "we need to compute integrals of the form @xmath12 where now @xmath13 are arbitrary functions of time , where trial functions @xmath14 satisfy a refinement equations : @xmath15 if we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets then only a finite number of coefficients do not vanish . to approximate the non - constant coefficients , we need choose a different refinable function @xmath16 along with some local approximation scheme @xmath17 where @xmath18 are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of @xmath19 and then replace @xmath20 in ( [ eq : var1 ] ) by @xmath21 . in particular case one can take a characteristic function and can thus approximate non - smooth coefficients locally . to guarantee sufficient accuracy of the resulting approximation to ( [ eq : var1 ] )",
    "it is important to have the flexibility of choosing @xmath16 different from @xmath22 . in the case when d is some domain , we can write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is characteristic function of d. so , if we take @xmath25 , which is again a refinable function , then the problem of computation of ( [ eq : var1 ] ) is reduced to the problem of calculation of integral @xmath26 the key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of refinement equation : @xmath27 this equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigenvector .",
    "thus , we reduced the problem of extension of our method to the case of variable coefficients to the same standard algebraical problem as in the preceding sections .",
    "so , the general scheme is the same one and we have only one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we in the same way can parameterize the solutions of corresponding problem .",
    "as example we demonstrate on fig .  1 a simple model of ( local ) intersection and the corresponding multiresolution representation ( mra ) .",
    "we consider scheme of modification of our variational approach in the case when we consider different scales separately . for this reason we need to compute errors of approximations .",
    "the main problems come of course from nonlinear terms .",
    "we follow the approach from [ 11 ] .",
    "let @xmath28 be projection operators on the subspaces @xmath29 : @xmath30 and @xmath31 are projection operators on the subspaces @xmath32 : @xmath33 so , for @xmath34 we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a multiresolution analysis of @xmath38 .",
    "it is obviously that we can represent @xmath39 in the following form : @xmath40 in this formula there is no interaction between different scales .",
    "we may consider each term of ( [ eq : form1 ] ) as a bilinear mappings : @xmath41 @xmath42 for numerical purposes we need formula ( [ eq : form1 ] ) with a finite number of scales , but when we consider limits @xmath43 we have @xmath44 which is para - product of bony , coifman and meyer .",
    "now we need to expand ( [ eq : form1 ] ) into the wavelet bases . to expand each term in ( [ eq : form1 ] ) into wavelet basis ,",
    "we need to consider the integrals of the products of the basis functions , e.g. @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the basis functions . if we consider compactly supported wavelets then @xmath48 where @xmath49 depends on the overlap of the supports of the basis functions and @xmath50 as the distance between scales such that for a given @xmath51 all the coefficients in ( [ eq : form4 ] ) with labels @xmath52 , @xmath53 have absolute values less than @xmath51 . for the purposes of computing with accuracy @xmath51 we replace the mappings in ( [ eq : form2 ] ) , ( [ eq : form3 ] ) by @xmath54 @xmath55 since @xmath56 and @xmath57 we may consider bilinear mappings ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) on @xmath58 .",
    "for the evaluation of ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) as mappings @xmath59 we need significantly fewer coefficients than for mappings ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) .",
    "it is enough to consider only coefficients @xmath60 where @xmath61 is scale function .",
    "also we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 now as in section ( 3 ) we may derive and solve a system of linear equations to find @xmath64 and obtain explicit representation for solution .",
