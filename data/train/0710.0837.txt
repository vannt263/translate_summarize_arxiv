    "@xcite found statistically significant 1 - 2 millisecond duration dips in the count rate during x - ray observations of the bright x - ray source sco x-1 carried out with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) and attributed them to occultations of the source by small objects orbiting the sun beyond the orbit of neptune , i.e. , trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) . in all , @xcite found some 58 dips in approximately 322 ks of sco x-1 observations .",
    "given that the _ rxte _ spacecraft moves through the diffraction - widened shadows of any tnos at a velocity of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , dips of @xmath22 ms duration should correspond to a tno size of @xmath260 m. if the identification of these dips with occultations by tnos is correct , the dips would provide extremely valuable information on the number and distribution of solar system objects of @xmath3 - 100 m in size .",
    "we have found evidence that these dips are produced by electronic dead - time as a result of high - energy charged particle events in the rxte pca detectors .",
    "preliminary reports of our results were given by @xcite ; herein we give a more detailed and complete report .",
    "subsequent to the report by @xcite , we searched for dips of the type they describe in the archival data obtained in @xmath4 ks of _ rxte_/pca observations of sco x-1 .",
    "these observations were performed starting in early 1996 soon after the launch of the spacecraft . for the search we only used observations that provided count rates of events with a time resolution of @xmath5 ms .",
    "the total count rate depends on the strength of sco x-1 at the time of observation as well as on the number of proportional counter units ( pcus ) that were operating and the location of the source within the field of view ; it ranges from below 40,000 cts s@xmath1 to nearly 200,000 cts s@xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig_pcaexpos ] ) .",
    "coincidences within a @xmath6  @xmath7s window among two or more of the measurement chains in a proportional counter unit ( pcu ) are normally used to identify charged particle events ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for technical information on the pca ) . however , the intensity of sco x-1 is so high that there is a substantial count rate due to the detection of two x - ray photons in two distinct regions of the detector serviced by different measurement chains within the 10  @xmath7s window . for most of the sco x-1 observations ,",
    "the rates of such so - called two lower - level discriminator ( `` 2-lld '' ) events were telemetered with sub - millisecond time resolution . in those cases where the 2-lld event data are available , we add 2 counts for each 2-lld event to the counts of single lld events .    in our search , we looked for instances when the number of counts in a time `` window '' that is an integral multiple of 0.25 ms ( @xmath8  s to be precise ) was less than that reasonably expected to occur given the mean count rate .",
    "the search was performed for each of the seven window intervals of 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , and 4 ms .",
    "the expected number of counts in each window was determined from the running average count rate in a time interval centered on the time window of 128 ms for the 0.75 and 1 ms windows , 192 ms for the 1.5 ms window , or 256 ms for the 2 , 2.5 , 3 , and 4 ms windows .    given @xmath9 , the number of counts actually measured in the window , and @xmath10 , the expected number of counts in that window based on the running average",
    ", we computed @xmath11 , the probability that @xmath9 or fewer counts would be detected based on the simplistic assumption that the counts obey a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath10 and standard deviation @xmath12 .",
    "we define the detection of a dip as any instance in which we found @xmath13 . in the search",
    ", the same dip could be found multiple times , e.g. , in contiguous intervals when it was longer than the window interval or for different window intervals .",
    "we generated a list of 203 dips in which these duplications had been eliminated .",
    "of these , 196 occur in data in which 2-lld events had been taken into account .",
    "all but three of the 58 dips of @xcite and all but 14 of the 107 dips identified by @xcite were identified in our search .",
    "eight of the latter 14 dips were not found by us because we did not search 5 orbits of data that @xcite searched , and because 6 of the 14 did not meet our significance threshold ( perhaps because we included 2-lld events ) .",
    "we detected more dips than @xcite because we included 2-lld events , because our significance threshold was slightly lower , and possibly because of other minor differences in the searches .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of dips was found to be a function of count rate , and , as one should expect , tended to be higher at the higher count rates . given our detection criteria , we found no dips at count rates below 43,000 cts s@xmath1 and only three at count rates below 55,000 cts s@xmath1 .",
    "we searched for dips in data which included approximately 570 ks of observations in which the count rates were above 55,000 cts s@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pcaexpos ] ) . for each of the seven window durations",
    ", we computed @xmath9 and @xmath10 for window intervals that started every 0.25 ms .",
    "thus the number of independent trials must be less than @xmath14 .",
    "if the actual probability of finding a dip due to a statistical fluctuation in each trial is @xmath15 , then at most a few of the 203 dips could be the result of statistical fluctuations .    in every case ,",
    "the actual probability of getting @xmath9 or fewer counts differs from our computed value for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the gaussian distribution we utilized overestimates the probabilities of small numbers of counts by large factors when compared with a poisson distribution of the same mean .",
    "second , the intensity of sco x-1 is time variable , and there is some chance that the mean intensity at the time of a dip was lower than that corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "if source variability was important , our detection procedure would have led to numerous spurious detections , particularly for the longer window durations .",
    "however , only four dip - like events were most significantly detected when using either the 3 or 4 ms window durations .",
    "we further checked the effects of source variability by , first , integrating properly normalized power density spectra of sco x-1 count rate data over the frequency range of 5 - 300 hz , 4 - 250 hz , 4 - 200 hz , 4 - 170 hz , or 4 - 125 hz for the 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , and 4 ms window durations , respectively .",
    "the resulting root - mean - square fractional amplitudes in the given frequency bands are typically @xmath16% and are almost always less than @xmath17%",
    ". these variablity estimates for each of the five window durations were then used together with the average count rates on an ( _ rxte _ ) orbit - by - orbit basis to estimate the effects on the dip detection probabilities .",
    "the results are consistent with the paucity of dips detected most significantly using the 3 ms and 4 ms window durations and indicate that statistical fluctuations in the presence of source variability did not produce more than @xmath18 spurious detections .    in order to obtain estimates of dip widths and depths",
    ", we used the idl procedure _ gaussfit _ to fit each dip profile with a function @xmath19 representing a constant count rate plus a gaussian shaped dip : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 were the parameters to be determined .",
    "the values of the fitted widths as parameterized by the values of @xmath24 , and of the fitted minimum normalized count rates , i.e. , the values of @xmath25 , of the @xmath26 dips are shown in figure  [ fig_realwd ] .",
    "the key features of this figure are the relatively narrow range of widths and absence of long dips .",
    "nearly all of the events have @xmath27 ms , and there is only one dip with @xmath28 ms .",
    "these aspects of the plot are discussed below ( see section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "if the counting rate dips are the result of occultations , then we would expect that diffraction effects would produce small count rate increases on either side of the dips .",
    "the sizes of these sidelobes and indeed the other details of the dip profiles depend on a number of factors including the sizes , shapes , distances , and velocities of the occulting bodies , the impact parameters characterizing the occultation events , and the velocities of the _ rxte _ spacecraft at the times the dips were observed .",
    "to quantify our expectations of the average diffraction sidelobe size and other typical properties of dips produced by occultations by tnos , we performed a monte carlo computer simulation of an ensemble of occultation events in which the occulting bodies were assumed to be opaque spheres , to have radii @xmath29 that follow a distribution @xmath30 , and to follow prograde circular orbits at a distance of 40 au from the sun . since the effects of diffraction are wavelength dependent , we took the spectrum of detected x - rays to be that of a typical pulse height spectrum of sco x-1 measured with the pca .",
    "the simulation was carried out for each of four cases in which the relative velocity between the spacecraft and the shadows of the occulting bodies was a fixed value , viz .",
    "15 , 25 , 30 , or 35 km @xmath31 .",
    "simulated dip profiles were computed for a large number of occultations with object size and occultation impact parameter chosen at random according to the appropriate distributions .",
    "the profiles were normalized to unity at times far from the occultation centers and were then inserted into the real pca count rate data by multiplying the actual count rates by the dip profiles .",
    "the dip center times were chosen at random among the 880 ks of observations that were used for the present analysis .",
    "these data were then searched for dips using the search algorithm described above .",
    "we fit the detected model dips with the function given by eq .",
    "the light curves of the pca data containing the detected simulated dips were superposed after aligning the dip centroids and rescaling the time scale of each light curve in order to normalize all of the fitted widths to the value @xmath32 ms .",
    "interpolation of the rescaled bin times to 0.25 ms time bins was required to superpose the rescaled light curves , and , as a consequence , adjacent bins in the superposition are not completely statistically independent .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ simprof ] .",
    "the average profile of the real detected dips was similarly constructed by superposing the pca light curves of 202 of the 203 detected dips after alignment and stretching ; the one dip with width @xmath33 ms was excluded .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig_superpos_202 ] . to check this",
    ", we also superposed only those 109 dips with fitted widths in a narrow range , i.e. , with @xmath34 ms @xmath35 ms .",
    "the light curves containing those 109 were aligned and summed , but no stretching was done .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig_superpos_109 ] .    per the results shown in fig .",
    "[ simprof ] , we expected to see sidelobes with intensities as high as @xmath28% above the mean count rate determined substantially away from the superposed dips .",
    "the superposed light curves do not exhibit diffraction sidelobes as high as those evident in the average profile of the simulated dips , despite having statistics sufficient to reduce fluctuations to @xmath21.6% ( 1  @xmath24 ) of the mean count rate . while the differences are not sufficiently significant to be conclusive , they strongly suggest there may be a problem with the occultation hypothesis .",
    "we elaborate on this in the discussion section below .",
    "three additional potential problems with the occultation interpretation are manifest from the dip profiles .",
    "first , the summed dip profile is distinctly asymmetric in shape as @xcite suggested for many of the individual dips .",
    "second , the distribution of dip widths is narrower than what one would expect from occultations by bodies with a power - law size distribution of index -4 , i.e. , there are fewer than expected statistically significant dips with gaussian fwhm widths greater than @xmath36 ms .",
    "third , when diffraction effects are taken into consideration , one would expect to see a correlation between the fitted widths and the fitted minimum count rates , such that longer dips tend to be deeper on average .",
    "no such correlation is seen in figure  [ fig_realwd ] .",
    "these findings prompted us to further explore alternative explanations for the dips .",
    "only one hypothesis appeared to be worthwhile to pursue , i.e. , that the dips are caused by electronic dead time in response to some type of charged particle shower in the spacecraft .",
    "unfortunately , no information with millisecond time resolution was available on the non - x - ray background during the sco x-1 observations .",
    "counts of good events , very large events ( vles ) , propane - layer events , and a catch - all category of other types of events ( hereafter sm1-other events ) that includes multiple lld events are available at 1/8 s time resolution from standard mode 1 ; most other types of data are only available with 16-s time resolution .",
    "the vle flag for a pcu is set when the electronics detect an event in that pcu with energy greater than @xmath2100 kev ; this can happen in response to the ionization produced by a single charged particle or to that produced by multiple charged particles which penetrate the detector nearly simultaneously .",
    "such a large event can produce ringing in the front - end of an electronic measurement chain .",
    "therefore , in response to the occurrence of a vle , the digital logic shuts down the electronic processing of events in that pcu for a fixed time period , chosen to be 50 @xmath7s for almost all of these sco x-1 observations .",
    "in addition , each of the 6 main xenon - layer measuring chains is disabled until its charge drops to an acceptable level . in order for the detector to be shut down for an extended period ( @xmath37 1  ms )",
    ", an extraordinary amount of charge must be deposited on most of the 6 main measuring chains ; it is unclear , at present , whether this can happen in response to a single charged particle .",
    "figure  [ fig : xraylc ] shows counts of three different types of events from standard mode 1 in 1/8-s time bins superposed around the times of 201 dips . in each panel , the centers of the dips have been placed in the bin at @xmath38 .",
    "the top panel shows the rates of good events , i.e. , those not identified as being due to charged particles , in the main xenon layers of all operating pcus , and clearly shows the superposed dips ; two - lld events are not included in these rates .",
    "the counting rate drops by only @xmath20.7% because of the dilution of a @xmath39 ms dip within a 128 ms bin .",
    "in contrast , the middle panel shows the _ enhancement _ of the counting rate of sm1-other events in the vicinity of the dips .",
    "the peak is highly significant ( @xmath238 @xmath24 ) .",
    "the bottom panel corresponds to the vle event rate superposed around the dip times .",
    "this peak is also statistically very significant ( @xmath27 @xmath24 ) .",
    "the increase in the vle rate is nearly so large as to be consistent with the detection of @xmath21 vle per pcu per dip .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "the enhancements in the sm1-other event and vle rates around the times of the dips indicate that there is an increase in the rate of detection of non - x - ray events .",
    "we speculate that these non - x - ray events interrupt normal event processing for 1 - 2 milliseconds in most of the pcus roughly once per hour due to the collection of very large amounts of charge",
    ". such an energetic event may be the consequence of a particle shower produced by the collision of a high - energy cosmic ray with a nucleus in the _ rxte _ spacecraft . in any case",
    ", further clarification of the causes of the observed dips would be of interest .",
    "the observed dips have widths and depths that are approximately what one might expect to be produced by occultations by tnos , even though much wider dips would be detectable in principle ( given appropriate depths ) .",
    "thus we are obligated to seriously consider the hypothesis that some or all of the observed dips are the product of tno occultations .",
    "however , close examination of the _ rxte _ pca data reveals six signatures that independently indicate that few and possibly none of the observed dips are due to occultations by tnos .",
    "the signatures are ( 1 ) the numbers of sm1-other events during the dips ; ( 2 ) the numbers of vle events during the dips ; ( 3 ) the absence of the expected diffraction sidelobes ; ( 4 ) the temporal asymmetry of the dips ; ( 5 ) the almost total lack of dips longer than @xmath21 ms ; and ( 6 ) the lack of correlation between dip duration and depth .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .",
    "\\(1 ) * sm1-other events : * fig .",
    "[ fig : xraylc ] shows that there is , on average for 201 dips , a large excess of sm1-other events at or near the times of the dips . on average",
    ", individual dips should show an excess of sm1-other events at the @xmath40 level . in fig .",
    "[ fig : otherhist ] we show a histogram of the number of sm1-other events in the 1/8-s time bins corresponding to the dips expressed in standard deviations from the mean .",
    "the mean value obtained from the histogram is @xmath41 , as expected .",
    "if one makes the reasonable assumption that the numbers of sm1-other events should not be affected by true occultations ( other than by negligible increases due to reductions in the electronic dead time ) , then one may estimate the maximum fraction , @xmath42 , of the observed dips that represent genuine occultation events that is consistent with this distribution of sm1-other events .",
    "we constructed the following simple function with which to fit the histogram , and thereby constrain @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of excess sm1-other counts ( in units of standard deviations of the counts per bin in each pca light curve ) , and @xmath45 is the mean of @xmath44 for those dips which are not the results of occultation events and which we take to be @xmath46 .",
    "the distribution of the numbers of excess sm1-other counts is wider than what would be expected from a poisson distribution with a mean equal to the slightly increased ( on average ) number of sm1-other events per bin ; the width of this component of the fitting function is adjusted by means of the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "fits of the function to the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : otherhist ] were carried out with @xmath48 fits using both gaussian and cash ( 1979 ) statistics .",
    "if we neglect the tail of the distribution at high numbers of excess sm1-other events , i.e. , at @xmath49 , we obtain formally acceptable fits with values of @xmath42 in the range 0.0 to 0.12 and values of @xmath47 in the range 1.85 to 2.35 ( based on gaussian statistics ; the limits represent the formal joint 95% confidence range ) . using cash statistics , we obtain formally acceptable fits with values of @xmath42 in the range 0.0 to 0.11 and values of @xmath47 in the range 1.65 to 2.15 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "these results indicate that fewer than 11% of the 203 dips might be the product of tno occultations .",
    "\\(2 ) * vle events : * figure  [ fig : xraylc ] also shows that there is an excess of vle events around the times of the dips . the difference between the background rate and that in the 1/8-s bin containing the dips is very close to 4 ( actually @xmath50 ) extra vle events per dip .",
    "the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : xraylc ] is significant at the @xmath51 level .",
    "if there is precisely one vle per operating pcu for each non - tno dip , then we would expect on average an excess of 4.67 vles per non - tno dip .",
    "if only the non - tno dips contribute to the excess vle events then there is an upper limit to @xmath42 that is consistent with the observations .",
    "if we further allow that the statistical mean excess number of vle events per dip may have been as small as 2.9 , then a simple calculation gives the limit @xmath52 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this limit is weaker than for the sm1-other events , and , furthermore , is compromised by the possibility that more than one vle event could be produced in a operating pcu in a single cosmic - ray induced dip .",
    "\\(3 ) * lack of diffraction sidelobes : * in fig .",
    "[ simprof ] we showed an average profile of simulated dips that had been inserted into actual pca data .",
    "it should be compared to averages of the actual measured dip profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig_superpos_202 ] and [ fig_superpos_109 ] .",
    "the average model dip profile shows a clear bump of @xmath53% amplitude on either side of the dip due to diffraction , whereas the averages of the actual profiles show no significant evidence for diffraction sidelobes .",
    "thus , we conclude that the fraction @xmath42 of legitimate tno occultations can be no larger than @xmath230% , otherwise diffraction sidelobes likely would have been detected .",
    "again , while this is a clear strike against the dips being due to tnos , the limiting statistically significant constraint that can be set due to the lack of diffraction sidelobes is not as significant as for the sm1-other events .",
    "\\(4 ) * asymmetry : * a comparison of the simulated with the actual dip profiles ( as in [ 3 ] ) above , clearly shows a marked asymmetry for the real dip events .",
    "this is physically implausible if the dips are the product of occultation events and therefore testifies against a tno origin for most of the dip events .",
    "we estimate that the statistical significance of the asymmetry is @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct way to use this information to constrain the fraction of legitimate tno occultations .",
    "the problem is that we do not know , a priori , how large the asymmetry is , on average , for non - tno dips .",
    "therefore , we can not tell how ` diluted ' the non - tno events are by potentially real ones .",
    "nonethless , this marked asymmetry is another solid indication that few of the dips are the product of tno occultations .",
    "\\(5 ) * lack of dips longer than @xmath21 ms : * from fig .",
    "[ fig_realwd ] we can see that all of the dips , except for a single event , have rms widths @xmath55 ms . in section  [ sec : data ] we described a computer simulation of the production , detection , and analysis of dips caused by tno occultations . for a relative speed between the _ rxte _ satellite and the shadows of the putative tnos of @xmath56 km s@xmath1 we find that the fraction of recovered simulated dips with @xmath28 ms is @xmath227% . for @xmath57 km s@xmath1 , @xmath58% of the dips have @xmath28 ms .",
    "we estimate that the average relative velocity between _ rxte _ and the shadows of any tnos was not higher than @xmath59 km s@xmath1 . for this speed , @xmath60% of the dips are characterized by @xmath28 ms . therefore",
    ", if _ all _ of the dips are the result of tno occultations the number of longer - duration dips should be @xmath230 , whereas the observed number is actually 1 . on the other hand , if only 15% of the dips are due to tno occultations , then we would expect only @xmath61 dips with @xmath62 ms .",
    "this expected number is marginally statistically consistent , i.e. , at @xmath25% confidence , with the detection of one dip with @xmath28 ms .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the lack of longer dips allows an upper limit of 15% to be set on the fraction , @xmath42 , of potentially real tno occultations .",
    "\\(6 ) * lack of correlation between width and depth : * if the dips were due to tno occultations of sco x-1 , we would expect a strong correlation between the widths of the dips and their depths .",
    "this results from the fact that diffraction produces shallow occultations for the smaller size occulters , while it produces deeper more geometric - shadowing - like occultations for the larger occulters .",
    "as can be seen from the distribution of dip widths vs. depths in fig .",
    "[ fig_realwd ] , there is no such correlation , with almost all of the dips confined to a narrow range of widths ( between 0.4 and 0.8 ms ) and depths that range all the way from 45% to nearly 100% .",
    "thus , the fact that the dips we detect include a significant number , i.e. , @xmath220% , that are both narrow ( @xmath63 ms ) and deep ( minimum normalized count rate below 0.2 ) whereas only @xmath39% of the ` detected ' simulated dips ( for @xmath59 km s@xmath1 ) are this narrow and deep , indicates that @xmath64% of the dips might be due to tno occultations .",
    "given the effects of statistical fluctuations on the observed number of narrow deep dips and the fact that the simulation is based upon somewhat uncertain parameters , it is more reasonable to use these numbers to set an upper limit of @xmath3% .",
    "summarizing the results from approaches ( 1 ) through ( 6 ) above , we find limits on the fraction of valid tnos to be @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , respectively , where `` q '' denotes that a formal limit could not be set , but the approach provides an important independent indication that the dips are , for the most part , not the result of tno occultations .",
    "we believe that the combined upper limit on @xmath42 due to the joint application of all six approaches is simply the minimum value achieved by the most sensitive of these , i.e. , the constraints can not be combined .",
    "the reason , in short , is that the effects we explore serve only to statistically limit the number of events which could be due to tnos rather than to identify specific qualifying events .",
    "therefore , our final limit is simply @xmath71 .",
    "one might argue , as did @xcite , that since @xmath6% of the observed dips can not be formally eliminated as being due to tnos , they serve as viable potential candidates for tno detections .",
    "however , we argue that if 90% of the dips can be securely eliminated as tno occultations , and there are six different and independent indicators that point in the direction of a common cause due to cosmic ray interactions in the detector , then it is most plausible that _ all _ of the dips have this common origin .    while our results cast serious doubt on whether any true occultation events have been detected , one can not yet conclude with a high degree of confidence that no such events have been detected .",
    "further investigations of the dip phenomenon and its possible causes would be of interest . we are working to obtain a new measurement of , or upper limit on , the rate of occurrence of occultations of sco x-1 by analyzing the data that are being obtained in a new series of _ rxte _ observations of sco x-1 with high - time - resolution information on vle events .",
    "given that we detected 203 dips in data that covered 570 ks of observations with count rates @xmath72 cts s@xmath1 , our upper limit on @xmath42 corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath73 occultations in the 570 ks of observations . if we adopt a model of the tno characteristics , this upper limit of detected tno occultations can be used to establish an upper limit on the abundance of small tnos . for this purpose",
    "we use the assumptions and results of our model tno simulations described above in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "a tno of radius @xmath29 appears to sweep out a solid angle per unit time @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the maximum impact parameter for which this body may produce a detectable dip , @xmath76 is the apparent transverse velocity of the tno , and @xmath77 is the distance from earth to the tno .",
    "we find from our simulations of occultations that , on account of diffraction effects , @xmath78 m for the model tnos in the relevant size range .",
    "we use @xmath59 km / s and @xmath79 au . the solid angle swept out in time",
    "@xmath80 is @xmath81 for an ensemble of tnos of various sizes , the average solid angle swept out per tno of radius @xmath82 is then @xmath83 where we have assumed that the differential size distribution of tnos is given by @xmath84 for @xmath85 . in our simulations",
    "we find @xmath86 m. using this and the above values , one obtains @xmath87 given that as many as 20 tnos may have been detected , the upper limit on the areal density of tnos is then @xmath88    this upper limit may be compared to previous measurements of the size distribution of tnos at larger radii .",
    "figure  [ fig_tno_pop ] summarizes the results of surveys of tnos smaller than 1000 km .",
    "the smallest tnos which have been securely detected were found in the hubble space telescope acs survey reported by @xcite , in which 3 tnos of radius @xmath89 km were found in 0.019 square degrees of sky .",
    "we also show the population estimates from ground - based surveys that are summarized in table 2 of @xcite ."
