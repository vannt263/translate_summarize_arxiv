    "the accretion of gas onto galaxies from the external environment remains poorly understood .",
    "the main obstacle to making progress through direct observations is that data at a single frequency provides information on a very restricted range of gas densities and temperatures . in particular , the presence of a background radiation field of ultraviolet radiation produced by quasars and star - forming galaxies results in much of the hydrogen in the halos of galaxies being ionized and inaccessible to radio observations of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen .",
    "the ionized gas component is most easily probed by absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars .",
    "the main limitation is that each quasar sightline provides a purely 1-dimensional view of the intervening gas and it is only possible to reconstruct the density profiles and the structure of the circumgalactic gas statistically by combining large numbers of quasar spectra that pass through the halos of many different galaxies ( see rudie et al 2012 ; tumlinson et al 2013 ; werk et al 2015 ; borthakur et al 2015 for recent examples of studies of this kind ) .    in principle , cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide a means of _ predicting _ how gas accretes onto galaxies .",
    "early work emphasized a dichotomy between so - called `` cold accretion '' directed along filaments in dark matter halos with masses less than @xmath6 , and a quasi - spherical `` hot mode '' of accretion in more massive halos ( keres et al 2005 ) .",
    "these results were later shown to be sensitive both to the numerical implementation used to solve the equations of hydrodynamics ( nelson et al .",
    "2013 ) , and to the implementation of feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei ( nelson et al .",
    "however , early generations of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations also generally failed to match basic observational quantities , including the stellar mass - to - halo mass relation for galaxies ( guo et al 2010 ) and the size distribution function of galaxies at fixed mass ( weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "most simulations also failed to reproduce the relative fractions of star - forming and non - star - forming objects in the real universe ( e.g. cattaneo et al 2007 ) , and were thus unlikely to provide accurate predictions for the properties of the gas surrounding galaxies of different masses and types .    in the last year or two",
    ", the situation has changed quite dramatically .",
    "the illustris ( vogelsberger et al 2014 ) and eagle ( schaye et al 2015 ) simulation projects have published results from large ( 100 mpc@xmath7 ) volume simulations with gas / dark matter mass resolutions of a few @xmath8 , which contain many hundreds of galaxies of milky way mass that are simulated with spatial resolutions of 0.7 - 1 kpc . the physical inputs , e.g. the supernovae feedback prescriptions , are tuned to reproduce observed quantities . in the illustris simulations , for example , the model is tuned to match the present - day ratio of stars to dark matter ( dm ) for galaxies of all masses , and the total amount of star formation in the universe as a function of time .",
    "other simulation projects , e.g. nihao ( wang et al 2015 ) and fire ( hopkins et al 2013 ) , have concentrated on generating suites of cosmological zoom - in hydrodynamical simulations of haloes of different masses .",
    "once again , the aim has been to reproduce the stellar mass versus halo mass and the star formation rate versus stellar mass relations using the same treatment of star formation and stellar feedback for every object .",
    "these simulations are now starting to form the basis for studies of gas around galaxies as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "one approach that has been popular is to use the simulations to generate mock quasar absorption line spectra for direct comparison with observations .",
    "this is done by averaging gas physical properties including the density , temperature , metallicity and velocity in physical coordinates along a sightline through the simulation box , and then using look - up tables calculated with a photo - ionization code to find the ionization fraction for a number of different ionic species ( see for example ford et al 2013 ) .",
    "this methodology has now been implemented on the latest generation of simulations that reproduce stellar mass to dark matter mass ratios , and the mock spectra have been used to make comparisons with hydrogen and metal line absorption around both low - redshift ( suresh et al 2015a ; oppenheimer et al 2016 ) and high redshift ( shen et al 2013 ; bird et al 2014 ; rahmati et al 2014 ; faucher - gigure et al 2015 ; suresh et al 2015b ) galaxies . most of these analyses have focused either on comparisons of the radial dependence of ly@xmath9 and metal absorption line equivalent widths , or on the _ covering fraction _ of neutral hydrogen and metals , defined as the _ fraction of sightlines _ where intervening neutral hydrogen or metals are detected in the spectrum .    at high redshifts ,",
    "some of the simulations have had trouble explaining the large observed covering fractions of neutral hydrogen at impact parameters comparable to the virial radius of the galaxy ( faucher - gigure et al 2015 ; suresh et al 2015a ) , while others apparently produce better agreement with the data ( rahmati et al 2015 ) . also of interest are trends in cgm properties as a function of galaxy mass and type . in very recent work ,",
    "suresh et al ( 2015b ) examine whether the simulations are able to explain trends in ovi properties as functions of galaxy mass and star formation rate at low redshifts using the illustris simulations .",
    "the mass , temperature and metallicity of the cgm were found to increase with stellar mass , driving an increase in the ovi column density profile , which is not seen in observations .",
    "more recently , oppenheimer et al ( 2016 ) have performed a similar study with the eagle simulations and find that gas temperatures are high enough in group haloes to suppress the ovi column density , leading to better agreement with the data .",
    "taken together , these studies illustrate the diagnostic power of ly@xmath9 and metal absorption line analyses around galaxies .    in this paper , we take a somewhat different approach and concentrate on the predicted temperature and density structure , morphology and kinematics of the circumgalactic gas in the illustris simulations .",
    "the morphology of the gas has been probed to a limited extent in absorption line studies by studying trends in ly@xmath9 equivalent width as a function of orientation with respect to the stellar disk ( borthakur et al 2015 ) , while the velocity spread of the gas measured from the distribution of velocity offsets of the centroid of the primary ly@xmath9 component from the systemic velocity has been proposed as a test of neutral gas kinematics ( rudie et al 2012 ; liang & chen 2014 ; borthakur et al 2015 ) .",
    "these probes are crude , because they are derived by combining sightlines around multiple galaxies and can not , for example , probe whether the cgm is co - rotating with the stellar disk or not . as we will discuss , direct imaging of low column density neutral and ionized gas ( e.g. kamphuis et al 2013 ; zschaechner , rand & walterbos 2015 ) may provide additional direct tests of simulation predictions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly summarize pertinent details of the illustris simulations and describe our analysis strategy . in section 3",
    ", we present our results and in section 4 , we discuss these results in light of recent and future observational constraints .",
    "the illustris simulations are run using the arepo code ( springel 2010 ) , a finite volume scheme implemented on a moving mesh , which follows the gas flow in a quasi - langragian fashion . as a result",
    ", arepo retains the principal strengths of sph including its adaptivity to a large dynamic range in spatial scales , galilean invariance , and an accurate and efficient gravity solver .",
    "it also gains the strengths of finite volume codes , including the improved treatment of fluid instabilities , weak shocks which can be missed in sph , phase interfaces and shearing flows .",
    "we make use of data from the illustris-1 simulations , whose properties are summarized in table 1 of nelson et al ( 2015a ) .",
    "this is the largest and highest resolution of the publicly released simulations with a volume of 106.5 mpc@xmath7 , dark matter and gas particle masses of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and dark matter and gas gravitational softening lengths of 1.4 and 0.7 kpc .",
    "the reader is referred to vogelsberger et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for details on the behavior , implementation , parameter selection , and validation of the physical models implemented in these simulations .    of particular interest for results on the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen in galaxy halos presented in this paper is the implementation of primordial and metal - line radiative cooling in the presence of a redshift - dependent , spatially uniform , ionizing uv background field , with self - shielding corrections , and the implementation of galactic - scale outflows from supernovae and feedback from agn in both quasar and radio ( bubble ) modes . in brief :    * gas cooling . *",
    "the code includes a self - consistent calculation of the primordial cooling following katz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , on top of which the cooling contribution of metals is added in a simplified way by assuming that the cooling rate scales linearly with the total metallicity of the gas .",
    "photoionization rates from quasars and star - forming galaxies , which affect abundances and inject energy into the gas , are calculated based on the models of faucher - gigure et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in practice ,",
    "the cooling rates are evaluated from tabulated cloudy models which include as input gas temperature , density , metallicity , and the uv - background .",
    "this treatment of gas cooling and heating is valid under the assumption that gas is optically thin to the ambient uv radiation and will break down at gas densities greater than @xmath12 @xmath13 , above which the gas absorbs radiation and the attenuated radiation field affects the balance between cooling and heating compared to the optically thin case . in illustris , a `` self - shielding '' correction whereby the ionization and heating rates entering into the primordial network calculation are suppressed .",
    "the supression factors are based on the results of full radiative transfer calculations carried out by rahmati et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "* supernova feedback .",
    "* the implementation of supernova feedback is very similar to the scheme described in springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) and operates by probabilistically turning a star - forming ism gas cell into a wind particle .",
    "the probability depends on the instantaneous sfr of each gas cell , which is derived from the local gas density .",
    "this particle is then allowed to travel , decoupled from hydrodynamical forces , until it reaches a certain density threshold or a maximum travel time has elapsed , whereupon the particle disappears and its mass , momentum , thermal energy and all tracked metals are deposited into the gas cell in which it is located .",
    "the wind velocity and the mass loading of the particles are free parameters and in the fiducial illustris model , the wind particle is kicked perpendicular to the angular momentum vector of the parent subhalo of the galaxy ( corresponding to a bipolar wind ) .    *",
    "agn feedback * two modes of agn feedback are implemented .",
    "when the central black hole accretes at rates higher than about 5% of the eddington rate , the so - called `` quasar mode '' ( springel et al 2005 ) is implemented by assuming that a fraction of the radiative energy released by the accreted gas couples thermally to nearby gas within a radius that contains some fixed amount of mass .",
    "when the quasar mode is switched on , illustris also accounts for the effect of the agn radiation field on the cooling of the gas .",
    "this paper is concerned with cgm properties in low redshift galaxies , where the vast majority of black holes accrete at rates of only a few percent of the eddington rate . for these low - activity states of the black hole , a form of mechanical radio - mode agn feedback following sijacki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is implemented .",
    "bubbles of hot gas with radius 50 kpc , total energy @xmath14 erg and volume density @xmath15 kpc@xmath16 are placed into the halo at distances of @xmath17100 kpc from their centers . the radio - mode feedback efficiency provided by the bubbles",
    "is assumed to be a fixed fraction of the rest mass energy of the gas accreted by the black hole .",
    "the analysis in this paper focuses on galaxies with masses comparable to those of the milky way , i.e. galaxies with stellar masses ( calculated within twice the stellar half mass radius ) in the range @xmath18 residing in subhalos with dark matter masses in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the cgm of these galaxies is well - resolved in illustris-1 , with around 160,000 dark matter particles , 15,000 - 30,000 gas cells and 80,000 - 100,000 star particles contained within the virial radius of the subhalo . out of the 253 galaxies in this stellar mass range",
    ", we select 120 galaxies at z=0 ( snapshot number 135 ) such that they equally populate 4 bins in gas mass fraction , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is again evaluated within twice the stellar half mass radius . the four bins in @xmath0 are 0.01 - 0.03 , 0.03 - 0.1 , 0.1 - 0.3 and 0.3 - 1 .",
    "this is the maximal sample such that the equal number per @xmath0 bin criterion is satisfied .",
    "note that we do not implement any prescription for the fraction of gas in molecular form , so the parameter @xmath0 should be a close approximation to the total cold gas mass fraction interior to the optical radius of the galaxy .    in figure 1",
    ", we show distributions of the total cold gas mass fraction of galaxies in three different bins of stellar mass .",
    "solid black histograms show results from illustris , while red histograms show results from the cold gass survey ( saintonge et al 2011 ) , which obtained atomic and molecular gas masses for a sample of 350 representative nearby galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath22 .",
    "the central panel correpsonds to galaxies with stellar masses comparable to that of the milky way .",
    "we see that the dynamic range in gas fraction spanned by illustris is larger than in the data ; there are too few very gas - poor galaxies of milky way mass and too many very gas - rich galaxies .",
    "the median gas fractions of the simulated and observed data sets agree quite well , however , and are close to the observed value for the milky way ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we work with the `` cutouts '' provided by the illustris data base , that include all the dark matter , gas , star , wind and black hole information for both subhalos and the parent friends - of - friends halo for each galaxy . unless indicated otherwise ,",
    "the plots in section 3 are generated from the subhalo cutouts .",
    "we have excluded galaxies in clusters and massive groups from our analysis , so in the majority of cases the majority of the particles in the parent halo are bound to the subhalo of the central galaxy .",
    "we implement an algorithm to find the two - dimensional projection of the stellar mass distribution tion with the least scatter about the major axis and we call this the best edge - on projection .",
    "we begin by locating the centre - of - mass of the stellar distribution and translating the positions of all the particles so that the coordinate ( 0,0,0 ) is located at this position .",
    "we then proceed to find the best edge - on projection of the stellar distribution .",
    "this is done by projecting the cube along the x , y and z axes in turn , performing a linear fit to the stellar mass distribution for each 2-dimensional `` sky '' projection .",
    "the linear fit with the minimum scatter defines the x - axis of our new , chosen projection .",
    "this procedure makes sure we start with a galaxy with a well - defined major axis when viewed in two dimensions .",
    "the linear fit is carried out using standard least - squares regression , treating each grid cell above a given projected stellar mass density threshold as a separate data point . as our threshold , but find that the outcome is insensitive to this exact choice . ] the stellar distribution is then rotated around the new x - axis , until the scatter of the stellar distribution is minimized .",
    "this defines the best edge - on projection for the stars .",
    "we then create two - dimensional binned maps of the projected density of stars and gas , as well as gas - mass and stellar - mass weighted metallicity and velocity maps .",
    "an example of such a map for a galaxy with gas mass fraction comparable to that of the milky way ( @xmath24 ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the 2d binning in the x and y - directions is done in logarithmic units with a bin size of 0.15 in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution from gas and stars located at @xmath27 kpc is placed into the central bin , creating the spiky pattern seen in the stellar surface density map .",
    "this spiky feature may look somewhat artificial , but recall that the spatial resolution of the illustris-1 simulation is @xmath28 kpc , and making projected density plots in logarithmic units has the advantage of allowing us to visualize a wide range of spatial scales in a single diagram .    from",

    "the neutral hydrogen fractions and gas temperatures for each cell are read directly from the simulation outputs . in particular",
    ", each gas cell contains the fraction of its hydrogen mass which is neutral ( the neutralhydrogenabundance field ) , and multiplying this value by the cell mass times x=0.75 gives an estimate of the total neutral hydrogen mass . in the illustris simulation itself , this field",
    "is calculated through an iterative solution to the primordial hydrogen and helium network of katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1996 ) combined with the metal line radiative cooling processes , agn radiative feedback model and uvb heating as described in vogelsberger et al .",

    ", this calculation uses the effective temperature from the equation of state ism model of springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) , which would require further refinement for detailed analysis in this density regime .",
    "no model for the formation of molecular hydrogen has been included , so the column density estimates will be over - estimated for the very central regions with @xmath29 atoms @xmath30 .",
    "this complication should have negligible impact in the present work as we do not consider in detail hi in dense disk environments but instead focus on larger scales .    in the particular galaxy shown in figure 2 , the stars and the gas are well aligned , and distributed in a plane with both stellar and gas surface densities that fall off very steeply as a function of perpendicular distance from the disk beyond a scale heights greater than a few kpc .",
    "gas with temperatures less than @xmath31 k is also aligned with the disk extending in patches to scale heights of 2 - 3 kpc .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity in this galaxy is high : twice solar in the vicinity of the disk , dropping to a half solar at at a distance of 10 kpc above the plane .",
    "even though the neutral gas column density drops steeply at scale heights greater than a few kpc , the bottom left panel shows that the low density gas is co - rotating with the thin disk out to scale heights in excess of 10 kpc .        in the next section",
    ", we will define a series of metrics for quantifying the properties of these 2-dimensional gas maps , and we will study how these metrics depend on the quantity @xmath0 .",

    "average radial profiles are plotted in the top left panel .",
    "cyan , blue , green and red curves show results for galaxies with gas mass fractions @xmath0 in the range 0.3 - 1 , 0.1 - 0.3 , 0.03 - 0.1 and 0.01 - 0.03 , respectively . in the next three panels , individual ,",
    "radially - averaged data points are plotted for each of the 30 galaxies in each of the gas fraction sub - samples ( results are not shown for the lowest gas fraction sub - sample with @xmath32 . ) these panels allow us to assess the amount of scatter from one galaxy to another for a given radial bin .",
    "the samples have been constructed to contain galaxies in narrow range in stellar mass but with widely different gas mass fraction values evaluated within twice the optical radius , so it is no surprise that the radial stellar surface density profiles are the same for all bins in @xmath0 in figure 3 , but that the central gas surface densities scale strongly with @xmath0 in figure 4 .",
    "what is more interesting , is that the differences in total gas surface density as a function of @xmath0 persist out to radii of 200 - 300 kpc , i.e. out to the virial radius of the subhalo .",
    "this means that galaxies with more gas are located in dark matter halos with more gas .",
    "figure 4 also shows that the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in total gas surface density is a factor of two or more larger than the scatter in stellar surface mass density at all radii .",
    "figure 5 shows that the average temperature profile of the halo gas depends strongly on @xmath0 . in halos hosting galaxies with low gas fractions",
    ", the average temperature remains relatively constant at @xmath5 k all the way from 10 kpc to 100 kpc . only at radii",
    "less than 10 kpc , does the average gas temperature drop by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "in contrast , in halos hosting galaxies with high gas mass fractions , the average gas temperature drops montonically by a factor of 10 from radii of 100 kpc to the center",
    ". it should be noted , however , that there is very large ( factor 10 - 30 ) galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in the temperature profiles at all radii and for all of the @xmath0 sub - samples .",
    "the rise in gas temperature towards the outer regions of halos means that the neutral hydrogen column density exhibits a stronger radial dependence than the total gas surface density ( 6 orders of magnitude drop from r=0 to 100 kpc in @xmath33 compared to 4 orders of magnitude drop in total gas surface density ) . in addition , the large scatter in gas temperature induces a corresponding large scatter in @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , in figure 6 , clear trends are seen in radial neutral hydrogen column density distributions as a function of @xmath0 at radial distances less than 100 kpc , where the fraction galaxies that are surrounded by high neutral column density gas ( @xmath34 atoms @xmath3 ) is a strong function of @xmath0 .",
    "we will come back to this point in the next section , where we discuss how our results compare with recent observational findings .",
    "finally , figure 7 shows gas phase metallicity trends as a function of radius for the different @xmath0 sub - samples . the gas - phase metallicity is lower for galaxies with higher gas mass fractions and the strength of the effect increases strongly with radius out to the virial radius of the subhalo . at r=200 kpc ,",

    "the effects are significantly stronger in galaxies with low gas mass fractions compared to galaxies with high gas mass fractions . later on",
    "we will show that this is because high column density gas is located in a thickened , rotating structure in these systems .",
    "gas temperature profiles also show orientation effects . at radial distances",
    "less than 30 kpc , we see the expected effect that gas temperatures are lower along the disk than perpendicular to the disk .",

    "the dashed green line shows what happens if we divide the cold gas masses in the simulation by a factor of 2 to account for the fact that the molecular gas can contribute up to half the total cold gas content of nearby spiral galaxies ( saintonge et al 2011 ) . as can be seen",

    "analysis of the vertical dependence of the [ nii]/h@xmath9 , [ sii]/h@xmath9 , [ oi]/h@xmath9 and [ oiii]/h@xmath72 line ratios show that simple models where the halo gas is ionized by massive stars in the disk fail , and some secondary source of ionization must exist .",
    "more recently , two nearby , edge - on spiral galaxies ngc 3044 and ngc 4302 were observed with the vla to comparable depths ( zschaechner , rand & walterbos 2015 ) .",

    "figure 16 shows corresponding neutral gas weighted velocity maps for these galaxies .",
    "there are clear signatures of rotation in all the maps , but the velocity fields are quite complex in some cases , indicating that the gas in these systems is likely to be evolving dynamically",
    ". this will be the subject of future work with gas tracer particles .",
    "finally , we note that further modelling of the observed signatures of the ionized gas in illustris is also required to make contact with the optical spectroscopic data .",
    "_ role of heating by radio bubble mode feedback .",
    "_ we have shown that gas - poor galaxies in the illustris simulation have larger black holes that are accreting at a higher rate and returning more energy to the surrounding gas in the form of radio bubbles than gas - rich galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "this would imply that the main factor that determines gas accretion rates onto milky way type galaxies at the present day is the energy output from its supermassive black hole .",
    "does this paradigm have any observational support ?",
    "in 2010 , the fermi bubbles , clouds of energetic particles towering 10 kpc above the plane of the milky way were discovered by the fermi gamma - ray telescope ( su , slayter & finkbeiner 2010 ) .",
    "the fermi bubbles were subsequently probed using ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy by targeting quasars with sightlines passing through a clear biconical structure seen in hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission near the base of the northern fermi bubble ( fox et al 2015 ) .",
    "high velocity metallicty absorption components were detected , supporting a picture where the bubbles result from a biconical outflow emanating from the galactic center .",
    "if correct , this would imply that the milky way s black hole experienced an outburst 2.5 - 4 myr in the past that has resulted in significant heating of the surrounding gas . in the illustris simulations ,",
    "the radio bubbles are not launched from the black hole , but are placed at large radii ( @xmath17 100 kpc ) from the center of the halo .",
    "the greatest heating then occurs close to the virial radius of the subhalo , which may result in neutral hydrogen covering fractions at large radii that are too low to match observations .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that there are indications that the illustris simulations are producing predictions for the cgm that are in qualitative agreement with observations , but that significant challenges remain in matching observations quantitatively . this study has focused on galaxies in a narrow range in stellar mass , and by extension dark matter halo mass .",
    "properties of halo gas such as temperature are expected to depend strongly on mass and this will result in observational signatures such as line emission changing between low mass and high mass galaxies .",
    "constraints from large ifu surveys of extra - planar gas in nearby galaxies ( jones et al , in preparation ) should provide important new constraints in the near future .",
    "finally , our analysis of the cgm in the vicinity of milky way type galaxies has yielded a picture of a relatively smooth gaseous halo that is co - rotating with the central disk .",
    "it may be that when we examine the cgm over a wider range in both redshift and stellar mass , that we will find physical regimes where the morphology and kinematics of the cgm is quite different .",
    "it will also be interesting to see how and if the conclusions presented in this paper depend on hydrodynamics methodology and implementation of supernova and/or agn feedback .",
