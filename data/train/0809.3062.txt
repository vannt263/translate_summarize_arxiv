    "for over three decades the one - dimensional driven morse oscillator@xcite has served as a fundamental model to understand and elucidate the dissociation mechanism of diatomic molecules .",
    "the continued interest in this , seemingly simple , system is due to two main reasons .",
    "first , the hope is that insights into the mechanism can be utilized to understand infrared multiphoton dissociation of polyatomic molecules@xcite and related phenomena including vibrational predissociation@xcite and mode - specific dynamics@xcite .",
    "second , at present the focus of researchers is increasingly shifting from gaining mechanistic insights to controlling@xcite the various processes and in this regard a firm understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essential . therefore , it is not entirely surprising that the driven morse system has been studied in great detail from the quantum , classical , and semiclassical@xcite perspectives and with an equally diverse choice for the field - monochromatic@xcite , bichromatic ( with relative phase)@xcite , chirped@xcite , shaped pulses@xcite , and stochastic noise@xcite .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of a morse oscillator under the influence of external fields has become relevant in the context of models for quantum computing based on molecular vibrations@xcite .",
    "a majority of the studies have addressed the problem from a classical - quantum correspondence viewpoint ; a knowledge of the regimes where classical or quantum mechanisms are appropriate and regimes where they coexist and compete is crucial for control@xcite .",
    "several important insights have originated from such efforts which have established that molecular dissociation , in analogy to multiphoton ionization of atoms@xcite , occurs due to the system gaining energy by diffusing through the chaotic regions of the phase space .",
    "for example , an important experimental study by dietrich and corkum has shown@xcite , amongst other things , the validity of the chaotic dissociation mechanism .",
    "thus , the formation of the chaotic regions due to the overlap@xcite of nonlinear resonances ( field - matter ) , hierarchical structures@xcite near the regular - chaotic borders acting as partial barriers , and their effects on quantum transport@xcite have been studied in a series of elegant papers@xcite .",
    "a general consensus , atleast for the one - dimensional driven morse system , is that classical - quantum correspondence holds up rather well except in the regimes of quantum multiphoton resonances@xcite .",
    "a recurring theme in many of the works on driven morse system has to do with enhancing the dissociation .",
    "the search for ways to efficiently dissociate the molecule has led to a variety of suggestions like bichromatic fields with the relative phase as a control knob@xcite , frequency - chirped fields@xcite , and resonant stimulation@xcite",
    ". however , there are instances wherein one is interested in suppressing the dissociation rather than enhancing it .",
    "this is important , for example , in the context of vibrational quantum computing@xcite where loss of population into states other than the states of interest compromises the efficiency of the quantum gates .",
    "another example comes from coupled morse oscillator systems where it might be neccessary to keep one of the modes ` quiet ' in order to carry out mode - specific dynamics@xcite .",
    "a powerful approach to implement such constraints on the system comes from optimal control theory@xcite ( oct ) and indeed driven morse oscillator systems provide an ideal testbed for oct - based schemes@xcite . yet , in our opinion , it is worthwhile addressing the issue from a classical - quantum correspondence perspective as well .",
    "not only is it natural , given the extensive insights that classical mechanics can provide , but it might also provide a useful way of decoding information buried in an otherwise complicated optimal field coming out of an oct calculation .",
    "similar considerations are at the heart of several works@xcite aimed at understanding the dynamical origins of the control fields .",
    "since a detailed understanding of the role of various phase space structures in the driven morse system already exists , is it possible to use the phase space information to control the dissociation using additional , hopefully simple , fields ?",
    "recently@xcite , a similar question was addressed by huang _",
    "_ in the context of suppressing the multiphoton ionization of atomic systems .",
    "using methods@xcite developed in a different context , it was found that the ionization process could be suppressed by rebuilding some of the broken invariant tori at carefully chosen locations in the phase space .",
    "inspired by their approach , and noting the mechanistic similarities between molecular dissociation and atomic ionization@xcite , in this work we attempt to control the dissociation of a monochromatically driven morse oscillator using the local control algorithm . in their study , huang _ et al . _",
    "focused@xcite only on the classical aspects of suppressing the ionization .",
    "it is , however , important to ask if the classical barriers are effective quantum mechanically as well since it is not immediately clear that local barriers in the phase space translate to local suppression of quantum dynamics .",
    "we address this issue using the driven morse system and show that phase space barriers , especially cantori , do inhibit both classical and quantum dissociation .",
    "as one would expect , such good classical - quantum correspondence fails in the case of two - photon resonance . however , we show that the complication comes from a subtle interplay between classical and quantum mechanisms with resonance - assisted tunneling@xcite playing a key role .",
    "we begin by describing some of the salient features of the driven morse oscillator in section  [ model ] . after a brief description of the methodology ,",
    "section  [ dynamics ] contrasts the dissociation dynamics in the off - resonant and on - resonant situations and a specific initial morse state is identified to be subjected to the local control strategy . in section  [ num ] ,",
    "we give a brief summary of the local control method resulting in an analytic form of the control field . a simplified control field , appropriate for classical - quantum correspondence studies , is obtained .",
    "the efficiency of the simplified control term in recreating various cantori barriers in phase space and hence controlling the classical and quantum dissocation dynamics is shown and discussed in section  [ control ] .",
    "in the same section we illustrate the importance of resonance - assisted tunneling in the on - resonance regime .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ con ] with some comments on the method , possible generalizations , and future applications .",

    "it is well known that @xmath2 provides a good model for describing the anharmonic vibrations of diatomic molecules with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 being the dissociation energy , range of the potential , equilibrium position , and the reduced mass of the molecule respectively .",

    "a fit@xcite to the _ ab - initio _ data on hf yields the following form for the dipole @xmath13 with @xmath14 a.u . and @xmath15 a.u .",
    "however , the linear approximation @xmath16 with @xmath17 a.u . is used in the current work since , for the moderate field intensity of interest , the qualitative nature of classical and quantum dynamics are unaltered as compared to working with the dipole function in eq .",
    "moreover , as seen later , the linear form allows for a relatively easier implementation of the local control algorithm  @xcite in terms of deriving analytic expressions for the control field .",

    "we now turn to the issue of local phase space control of dissociation which , as seen later , provides answers to the first two questions posed above as well .",
    "the phase spaces shown in figs .  [ fig2](b ) and ( c ) , and the discussion in the previous section , suggest that if one can rebuild some of the irrational tori , such as the @xmath82 cantorus , locally in the phase space then it ought to be possible to suppress the dissociation .",

    "[ fig3 ] that the classical - quantum correspondence holds for local phase space control in the off - resonance case .",

    "as mentioned in the previous section , with the primary driving field frequency value of @xmath68 the quantum system is in the two - photon resonant regime involving the morse states @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
