    "as a first example , let us show how the mass defect allows us to formulate a very simple explanation of the gravitational redshift , even with a classical description of the gravitational field ( as classical newtonian potential @xmath17 ) .",
    "indeed , because the potential energy of a particle in a classical gravitational field is equal to the product @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 ) , we can write the energy of @xmath20-th state @xmath21 as : @xmath22 here we have used an equality of gravitational and inertial masses , @xmath23 . using eqs .",
    "( [ e_g ] ) and ( [ m_e ] ) , we find the frequency of the transition @xmath24 in the gravitational field : @xmath25 this expression coincides ( to leading order ) with a well - known result based on general relativity theory @xcite : @xmath26 in the case of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the combination of special relativity ( @xmath7 ) and quantum mechanics ( definition of the frequency of atomic transitions ) leads to a formally noncontradictory explanation of the gravitational shift ( [ omega_g ] ) , which describes different experiments with atomic clocks in a spatially nonuniform gravitational field @xmath28 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that expression ( [ omega_g ] ) was here derived without including time dilation , which is taken as a basis of einstein s theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the developed mass defect approach can be considered as `` quasi - classical '' explanation of gravitational shift .",
    "as a second example , we will perform an exact quantum - relativistic calculation of the frequency of transition under one - photon absorption and emission by a free - moving atom .",
    "we assume that the energy and momentum of the atom+photon system are conserved .",
    "considering the law of energy conservation for absorption / emission of a photon with frequency @xmath29 , the following relativistic relationship results : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the momenta of an atom in the internal states @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "let us first consider the absorption of a photon with momentum @xmath33 , where the unit vector @xmath34 is directed along the wave vector @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that initially the atom is in the lower sate @xmath2 and has the momentum @xmath32 .",
    "then , in accordance with conservation of momentum , we find the atomic momentum in the excited state @xmath3 after absorption of photon to be : @xmath36 . in this case , eq .  ( [ e_rel ] ) has the following form : @xmath37 which should be considered as an equation for the unknown frequency @xmath29 .",
    "taking into account ( [ m_e ] ) , the exact solution of eq .  ( [ e_rel_abs ] ) can be written as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the frequency of the recoil , which is the correction associated with the so - called recoil effect . for atomic transitions of optical range ( @xmath40@xmath41  hz )",
    ", we have the following estimate : @xmath42@xmath43  khz . using the relativistic relationship between momentum @xmath32 and velocity @xmath44 ( for the lower state @xmath2 ) : @xmath45 , formula ( [ omega_abs_p ] ) can be rewritten : @xmath46 let us calculate now the frequency of a photon emitted along the line of @xmath47 by the moving atom , which was initially in the upper level @xmath3 and had momentum @xmath48 . in this case , the momentum of atom in the lower level @xmath2 after emission of photon becomes @xmath49 .",

    "( [ e_rel ] ) , we obtain the following result : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the correction due to the recoil , and the velocity @xmath52 and momentum @xmath48 are connected by the relationship : @xmath53 .    for comparison ,",
    "let us consider the absorbing / emitting classic oscillator with eigenfrequency @xmath54 , which moves with velocity @xmath55 relative to laboratory system of coordinates . in this case",
    ", using the lorentz transformations , we obtain the following well - known expression for the frequency of the electromagnetic wave under absorption / emission along the line @xmath47 : @xmath56 comparing eq .",
    "( [ omega_rel ] ) with formulas ( [ omega_abs_v ] ) and ( [ omega_rad ] ) , we see that the quantum - relativistic calculation significantly differs from the classically - relativistic version .",
    "formally this can be seen as a renormalization of the eigenfrequency @xmath54 : @xmath57 in the case of absorption [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_abs_v ] ) ] , and @xmath58 in the case of emission [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_rad ] ) ] .",
    "note that the interrelation of the second - order doppler shift and mass defect in the context of free - moving object was previously shown for m@xmath59ssbauer effect in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the usual doppler formula ( [ omega_rel ] ) was derived as a consequence of conservation of energy and momentum instead of the phase invariance . however , the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite is not quite suitable for atomic clocks , because it did not include the recoil effect [ see @xmath60 in the exact expressions ( [ omega_abs_v ] ) and ( [ omega_rad ] ) ] , which is very important for frequency standards based on free atoms",
    ". our formulas ( [ omega_abs_v ] ) and ( [ omega_rad ] ) will coincide with eq .",
    "( [ omega_rel ] ) in the limit @xmath61 , when @xmath62 .",
    "a third example concerns frequency shifts for trapped atoms ( ions ) in the external confinement potential . in this case",
    ", the conservation of energy and momentum does not exist .",
    "therefore , the above consideration for free atoms is not valid , and the implementation of the mass defect concept requires another approaches , which are developed below .    for simplicity , we will consider a stationary confinement potential @xmath63 , which we take to be the same for both states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such a situation can occur both for clocks based on neutral atoms in optical lattice and those based on trapped ions . in this case",
    ", we use the standard formalism that quantizes the energy levels with translational degrees of freedom : @xmath64 where hamiltonian @xmath65 and state @xmath66 describe the translational motion of the particle in the @xmath20-th internal state @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , and @xmath69 is coordinate of atomic center - of - mass .",
    "thus , taking into account the translational motion , the atomic wave function is described by the pair products @xmath70 . because of the mass defect ( @xmath71 ) , the energy levels for the lower and upper states differ : @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , the frequency @xmath73 between corresponding levels of trapped particle is different from the unperturbed frequency , @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with a value @xmath74 ( see fig .",

    "( [ h_e ] ) and taking into account @xmath83 , we obtain the following estimation of the relative value of shift ( [ de_vib ] ) : @xmath84 we note that this expression coincides with a well - known relativistic correction , which is the quadratic doppler shift due to the time dilation effect for moving particle @xcite .",
    "we see this correspondance if we consider the conventional explanation for this effect . in accordance with special relativity , the tick rate @xmath85 in the moving ( with velocity @xmath55 )",
    "coordinate system changes with respect to the tick rate @xmath86 in motionless ( laboratory ) coordinate system by the law : @xmath87 . as a result ,",
    "an atomic oscillation with eigenfrequency @xmath54 is perceived by an external observer to be shifted to : @xmath88 . in the nonrelativistic limit , ( @xmath89 )",
    ", we have : @xmath90=\\omega_0[1-({\\bf p}/m)^2/(2c^2)]$ ] ( where @xmath91 is  momentum of particle ) .",
    "then , if we take into account quantum considerations through the replacement @xmath92 , we obtain the expression for frequency shift ( [ d_frac ] ) .",
    "thus , the conventional explanation formally requires the use of the eigen- ( internal ) time of atom .",
    "however , because of the wave nature of quantum objects and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics , a notion of the internal time ( as some continuum ) of a quantum particle , spatially localized in a confined potential , seems unclear and even contradictory . in this context ,",
    "an approach , based on the mass defect concept , has not such internal logical contradictions and comes to the standard quantum - mechanical formulation ( [ e_vib ] ) , which does not require the notion of the eigen - time of quantum particle .    to define more precisely the frequency shift for trapped atoms ( ions ) , we need to find the stationary states from the klein - gordon equation : @xmath93 ^ 2-c^2\\hat{\\bf p}^2-m^2_j c^4\\}|\\psi_j\\rangle = 0\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^\\text{(tot)}_j = e^{(0)}_j+{\\cal e}^{\\text{(vib)}}_j\\,,\\quad ( j=\\text{g , e}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in confined potential @xmath63 .    in the case of dynamic confinement of the particle in time - dependent potential @xmath94 ( for example , in rf paul trap for ions )",
    ", the mass defect concept is also applicable and can explain , in particular , the frequency shift , which is usually interpreted as the micromotion shift .",
    "indeed , in the case of relatively hight rf frequency in paul trap , there is well - working approximation of so - called pseudopotential @xcite , which can be expressed ( in context of mass defect ) as following : @xmath95 where the first term is connected with the static electric potential , and the second term is related to the micromotion and it is produced by the rf oscillating potential . as we see , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ pseudo ] ) is mass - dependent . in this case",

    "( [ d_frac ] ) , and which can be considered as secular - motion - induced shift . the second contribution in eq .",
    "( [ d_frac_pseudo ] ) can be interpreted as micromotion shift .",
    "note that both these shifts have comparable values , in the general case .    in the case of purely rf paul trap with @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ pseudo ] ) , we have the following relationships for hamiltonians , vibrational energies and eigenfunctions : @xmath100 leading to the total fractional frequency shift : @xmath101 which contains both secular - motion and micromotion contributions [ see eq .",
    "( [ d_frac_pseudo ] ) ] .    note that in a similar way we can consider the mass defect effects in the case of several ions confined in the same trap .",
    "besides the reinterpretation of some well - known shifts , the mass defect concept predicts additional contributions for frequency shifts that have not been previously discussed in the scientific literature .",
    "we emphasize that these additional shifts connected with translational degrees of freedom and they vanish if we will not take into account the mass defect .    as a first example , let us consider the shift of the transition @xmath102 for a charged ion due to an extraneous ( uncontrolled ) static spatially nonuniform electric field @xmath103 .",
    "we assume that the ion is localized in an rf paul trap , and its center of localization coincides with the origin of a cartesian coordinate system with orthogonal unit vectors @xmath104 .",
    "also we assume that the functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 , formed by the _ controlled _ trap potential ( [ pseudo ] ) , are known",
    ". then we can calculate the shift , produced by the weak uncontrolled field @xmath103 , as quadrupole shift in the frame of perturbation theory . for this purpose , we consider the ion as a point charge , when the operator of its quadrupole moment is determined as a standard symmetrical tensor of the second order : @xmath107 where @xmath108 are cartesian coordinates of radius - vector of particle @xmath109 ; @xmath110 is kronecker symbol ; integer @xmath111 is degree of ionization ; and @xmath112 is electron charge . in this case , the residual quadrupole moment , conditioned by mass defect , is determined by the difference tensor : @xmath113 where the states @xmath105 and @xmath114 describe the spatial localization of ion in the internal states @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively [ see eq .",
    "( [ e_vib ] ) ] . in the general case",
    ", we have @xmath117 due to the mass defect , and an order - of - magnitude estimate is the following : @xmath118 is the typical size of wavefunction ( size of the localization of an ion cloud in the trap ) , and @xmath119 .",
    "though the expression ( [ dq_vel ] ) contains a very small multiplier , @xmath120 , however the size of ion localization @xmath121 significantly exceeds the bohr radius @xmath122 . indeed , @xmath123@xmath124",
    "@xmath122 even for the deeply - cooled ion to the lowest vibrational level in the confined potential @xmath63 ( i.e. , for the quantum limit of cooling ) , and @xmath125  @xmath122 for the upper vibrational states , which are populated if the ion is laser - cooled to the usual so - called doppler temperature ( mk range ) . as a result ,",
    "the quadrupole shift of the clock transition , modified by the mass defect , can be metrologically significant for modern and future optical frequency standards .",
    "for example , let us consider an atomic clock based on transition @xmath126@xmath127@xmath128 in the ion @xmath129al+ @xcite .",
    "because of the zero electronic angular moment for the clock transition , @xmath130 , the quadrupole shift is very small ( @xmath131 , see in ref .",
    "however , on the basis of formula ( [ dq_vel ] ) , we estimate @xmath132@xmath133 2@xmath134@xmath135 for @xmath136  @xmath137@xmath138 . as another example , let us consider the so - called nuclear clock , based on the intranuclear transition in @xmath139 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the residual quadrupole moment for the clock transition was estimated to be : @xmath140 .",
    "using now our formula ( [ dq_vel ] ) , we find @xmath132@xmath133 @xmath141@xmath142 for @xmath136  @xmath137@xmath138 , that can significantly exceed the estimation in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the dependence on the size of localization @xmath121 ) .",
    "such values of the quadrupole moment maybe important for atomic clocks with fractional uncertainty at the level of @xmath143@xmath144 .",
    "however , for more accurate estimations , it is necessary to know the wave functions on the translational degrees of freedom @xmath145 .",
    "for example , this quadrupole shift is absent for spherically - symmetrical states , when @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "also the residual quadruple shift ( [ dq ] ) vanishes for purely rf paul trap , because of @xmath148 [ see eq .",
    "( [ purely_rf ] ) ] .    to see another manifestation of mass defect ,",
    "let us consider a previously unknown contribution to the ac - stark shift in the presence of extraneous weak low - frequency field , @xmath149 . here",
    "we will investigate only shifts of the quantum levels @xmath150 and @xmath79 on the translational degrees of freedom of trapped ion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the standard expression for the dynamic shift of the @xmath151-th vibrational level @xmath152 in the lower state @xmath2 has the form : @xmath153 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\cal d}^{mn}_\\text{g}=\\langle\\psi_\\text{g}^{(m)}|\\widehat{{\\cal d}}|\\psi_\\text{g}^{(n)}\\rangle \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the operator of the dipole moment of the localized ion cloud .",
    "similarly we can determine the shift for the @xmath151-th vibrational level @xmath155 in the upper state @xmath156 .",
    "note that the square of the ion - cloud dipole moment has the order - of - magnitude of @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 is typical size of localization of wavefunction @xmath159 , which is many orders greater than the square of the atomic dipole moment @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the vibrational levels of a trapped ion are very sensitive even to weak extraneous fields . however , because @xmath156 and @xmath161 are slightly different due only to the mass defect , we find an estimate of the difference shift : @xmath162 conclusion ----------    to conclude , we have considered some manifestations of the mass defect in atomic clocks . as a result",
