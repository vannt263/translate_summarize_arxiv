    "the study of globular cluster systems of dwarf galaxies complements the numerous studies of such systems in larger elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "few globular cluster systems ( gcss ) around dwarf galaxies beyond the local group have been studied to date with respect to their cluster system ( see ashman & zepf 1998 ) .",
    "this is mostly due to the low numbers of globular clusters present in such galaxies .",
    "however , their properties are relevant for a number of globular cluster system formation scenarios .",
    "dwarf galaxies are expected to provide insight into how the smallest galaxies build up a system of globular clusters .",
    "further , their properties must be known in order to verify scenarios in which larger globular cluster systems are predicted to build up by the accretion of proto - galactic fragments or dwarf galaxies ( @xcite 1998a , @xcite 1998 , @xcite 1999 ) .",
    "these scenarios relate to the older idea that galaxy halos might have formed through the assembly of such small stellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "photometric studies of several globular cluster systems in dwarf galaxies were carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the systems of 11 dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "all were found to host globular cluster candidates and have specific frequencies ranging from 3 to 8 , similar to local group dwarfs and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied 24 dwarf ellipticals in the virgo and fornax clusters as well as in the leo group .",
    "they found that de , n galaxies had higher specific frequencies than de galaxies , with values around @xmath9 , increasing with increasing @xmath10 ( decreasing luminosity ) . not much is known yet about the metallicities of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite constructed a metallicity distribution for all local group dwarf galaxies and noticed that the distribution was peaked around [ fe / h]@xmath11 dex with no clusters more metal - rich than [ fe / h]@xmath12 dex .",
    "@xcite derived metallicities from washington colors for two of their virgo dwarf ellipticals and obtained a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath13 dex .",
    "@xcite studied the gcs of the de ngc 3115 dw1 in more detail and found it to be relatively rich ( see below for a more detailed description of their results ) .",
    "this motivated us to carry out spectroscopy for some of the globular cluster candidates in this galaxy to get a more detailed picture of their chemical and kinematical properties .",
    "further , hst / wfpc2 data were available from the archive , allowing us to study the sizes of some of the clusters .",
    "ngc 3115 dw1 is a de1,n galaxy in the vicinity of the giant s0 galaxy ngc 3115 .",

    "we analyze the spectroscopic data giving first a brief kinematical study of the globular cluster system before discussing the abundances and the overall metallicity of the system . in section 4",

    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "46 spectra of candidate globular clusters in ngc 3115 dw1 were obtained with the lris - a spectrograph @xcite on the keck - ii telescope during the nights of 1996 december 18th and 19th .",
    "the observations were performed in multi - slit mode using two slit masks containing 24 ( mask a ) and 22 slits ( mask b ) , respectively .",

    "for all observations the first order of the 600/5000 grism ( i.e.  600 lines mm@xmath20 ) was used with slitlets of 1  which provided a dispersion of 1.3   pix@xmath20 ( at 5000  ) and a spectral resolution of 4.1   fwhm@xmath20 .",
    "all frames were binned ( 1@xmath21 ) perpendicular to the dispersion axis during the read - out . for each night",
    "the images were reduced individually and eventually combined .",
    "a master bias was created from 5 zero - second images , taken at the end of each night .",
    "a master flat was obtained from 5 twilight - flat images obtained each night .",
    "each object image was bias subtracted and flat - fielded in a standard way . with the iraf package _ apall _ we traced , extracted and sky subtracted all object spectra .",
    "the sky was `` optimally '' subtracted , i.e.  modeled with variance weighting perpendicular to the object spectra before being subtracted @xcite .",
    "hgkrne - calibration - lamp spectra were obtained for wavelength calibration .",
    "the calibration spectra were traced , extracted , and sky subtracted exactly in the same way as the object spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration was verified on sky spectra included in each slit spectrum .",
    "the overall standard deviation of the wavelength calibration was determined to be @xmath22  for both nights .",
    "the field - of - view of lris - a is 6  @xmath18 8 .",
    "we placed the multi - slit masks on the central / north and south - eastern part of ngc 3115 dw1 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ps : fov ] .",
    "the slit masks were aligned such that the slits were pointing towards the center of the giant s0 galaxy ngc 3115 . due to the restrictions in making the masks ( long enough slits , wavelength coverage , etc . ) about 50% of the targets could be selected from the previous photometry of @xcite ( see fig .",

    "the brightest clusters were matched on both the f555w and f814w images and their sizes were studied .",

    "in this section we extract heliocentric radial velocities @xmath24 of globular clusters and perform a mass estimate of the host galaxy , ngc 3115 dw1 .",
    "subsequently , we measure abundances using the lick / ids passband definitions and infer a mean metallicity of the gcs .",
    "we derived radial velocities by two different methods .",
    "velocities were derived by cross - correlation with high s / n template spectra of two bright gcs in m31 : 225 - 280 and 158 - 213 ( for nomenclature see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cross - correlation was carried out with the iraf task _ fxcor_. all measurements are summarized in table [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "the `` internal '' errors which are given by the cross - correlation code lie about @xmath25 km s@xmath20 for well defined high - s / n spectra and increase rapidly as the object spectrum becomes less defined .    for 7 high - s",
    "/ n spectra we also estimated the radial velocity by measuring redshifts of individual absorption lines ( see footnote in table [ tab : rvs ] ) .",
    "the mean radial velocity from cross - correlation served as a first guess to the mean wavelength - shift determination .",
    "we used the iraf package _ rvidlines _ which employs a _",
    "center1d _ code to match the center of each individual absorption feature ( see manual of _ rvidlines _ ) .",
    "we obtained an `` internal '' mean error from the averaging process which is @xmath23 100 km s@xmath20 . the results and their errors",
    "are included in table [ tab : rvs ] .      after obtaining the radial velocities from cross - correlation and in some cases from wavelength shifts of individual absorption lines , we combined all available measurements for further selection of globular clusters by radial velocity .",
    "velocities derived from cross - correlation were given twice the weight of velocities from absorption lines .",
    "the average radial velocity for each object can be found in the last but one column of table [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "figure [ ps : rvhisto ] shows a radial - velocity histogram of objects with @xmath26 km s@xmath20 .",
    "the figure shows a hint of bimodality due to the extended tail of velocities @xmath27 500 km s@xmath20 .",
    "based on the measured radial velocity of ngc 3115 dw1 of @xmath28 km s@xmath20 ( @xmath29 km s@xmath20 @xcite 1991 , @xmath30 km s@xmath20 @xcite 1993 , and @xmath31 km s@xmath20 @xcite 1993 ) and an adopted velocity dispersion of the gcs in ngc 3115 dw1 of @xmath32 km s@xmath20 ( see below ) , globular clusters should have radial velocities in the range @xmath33 km s@xmath20 .",
    "seven candidates lie within this range .",
    "this cut enables a reliable differentiation between foreground objects of low radial velocity and globular clusters in ngc 3115 dw1 .",
    "we used the kmm code @xcite to obtain the statistical significance of bimodality .",
    "the kmm code fits two gaussians to the data using maximum - likelihood techniques .",
    "the data can be fit with two gaussians of identical dispersion or two gaussians of independent dispersion .",
    "we applied both techniques .",
    "the mean radial velocities of the two gaussians are @xmath34 km s@xmath20 and @xmath35 km s@xmath20 for identical - dispersion and @xmath36 km s@xmath20 and @xmath37 km s@xmath20 for independent - dispersion fitting .",
    "the error is the error of the mean calculated from the variance of each distribution .",
    "kmm estimates also the fraction of data points which are part of each sub - distribution . of 28 objects in the histogram ( one additional object , d26 ,",
    "is not included due to @xmath38 km s@xmath20 ) in figure [ ps : rvhisto ] , kmm assigns 21 objects to the sub - population with the lower mean radial velocity and 7 to the sub - population with the higher mean radial velocity which is in good agreement with the expectations ( see [ ln : specobs ] ) .",
    "the confidence level for bimodality is @xmath39% .",
    "the ( weighted ) mean radial velocity of all 7 detected globular clusters is @xmath40 km s@xmath20 .",
    "this value deviates from the measured radial velocity of ngc 3115 dw by @xmath41 which is a hint that we are biased towards lower velocities by both the small sample and the choice of slit - mask position on the sky .",
    "since we detected globular clusters predominantly in the central and northern field of ngc 3115 dw1 our measurements could be influenced by a systematic rotation of the gcs ( see also sect .  [",
    "ln : rotdisp ] ) .",
    "all 22 objects with low radial velocities have a weighted mean velocity of @xmath42 km s@xmath20 . assuming a simple stellar rotation model for the milky way we expect the foreground stars in the direction of ngc 3115 dw1 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) to have @xmath43 km s@xmath20 @xcite which is in rough agreement with our measurement .",
    "in summary , within our data of 46 spectroscopically - analyzed objects we found 7 globular clusters 22 foreground stars , and 15 background galaxies ( 9 of them are significantly clumped about @xmath44 km s@xmath20 or @xmath45 ; the velocity dispersion of this potential galaxy cluster is @xmath46 km s@xmath20 ) .",
    "2 objects ( d21,l6 ) could not be identified reliably and were therefore dropped .",
    "the radial - velocity data for all objects are summarized in table [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "our data sample of 7 globular clusters is only sufficient for a first rough mass estimate of ngc 3115 dw1 and its m / l ratio .",
    "furthermore , we rely in this section on the assumption that the system is not influenced by the nearby giant s0 galaxy , an assumption that we will question in sec .",
    "[ ln : discussion ] .",
    "we used two mass estimators which are extensively described and tested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we applied the virial mass estimator ( vme ) and the projected mass estimator ( pme ) accounting for different orbit characteristics of the globular clusters .",
    "since the alignment of our multi - slit masks is biased towards clusters of the central and northern quadrant of the galaxy , our data is subject to unknown systematic east - west rotation of the entire globular cluster system . if the angular momentum vector points along the north - south axis we will have under- or overestimated the mass depending on the direction of rotation . although , it is possible to provide a lower - mass limit from our spatially constrained cluster sample by varying the mean systemic velocity ( see below ) , it is not possible to correct completely for the unknown total rotation of the globular cluster system ( see also [ ln : rotdisp ] ) .",
    "we let the radial velocity of ngc 3115 dw1 ( which is assumed to be the mean velocity of the gcs as well ) vary over a wide range while the measured radial velocities of the globular clusters remained fixed . during each step of 10 km s@xmath20 we calculated the mass of the galaxy with each mass estimator .",
    "the resulting plot ( mass vs. @xmath24 of the gcs ) is shown in figure [ ps : massestim ] .",
    "table [ tab : massestimate ] shows the lower mass limits calculated with all mass estimators .    at the highest measured radial velocity of ngc 3115 dw1 ( @xmath47 km s@xmath20 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we obtain total masses in the range @xmath48m@xmath3 to @xmath49m@xmath3 .",
    "the estimated masses for the measured mean radial velocity of the globular cluster system ( @xmath50 km s@xmath20 ) are in the range @xmath51m@xmath3 to @xmath52m@xmath3 .",
    "the errors in table [ tab : massestimate ] are the intrinsic , statistic , and systematic uncertainties of the mass - estimate .",
    "the first is the uncertainty of the code itself @xcite while the remaining are due to the limited sample size and the uncertain distance .",
    "all masses are the total mass estimates within a galactocentric radius of @xmath53  or @xmath54 kpc , respectively .",
    "this is the projected radial distance of the outermost globular cluster ( l63 ) .",
    "assuming an _ isotropic _ orbit distribution for globular clusters in ngc 3115 dw1 the lower - mass limit for the galaxy of @xmath55m@xmath3 seems rather large for a dwarf elliptical .",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath8 mag @xcite is high as well ( more than a magnitude brighter than m32 for example , and similar to ngc 4486b , although ngc 3115 dw1 has a dissimilar structure to that of these low - l es ) .",
    "the mean absolute v - magnitude for nearby dwarf ellipticals is @xmath56 mag @xcite .",
    "considering its mass and luminosity we address the fact that ngc 3115 dw1 appears to be a transition - type galaxy between luminous des and low - luminosity ellipticals in the discussion section .      limiting the data set of radial velocities to smaller radii we can probe the radial mass dependencies in ngc 3115 dw1 . clearly , statistical errors become important when we reduce the already small data set by removing the outermost globular clusters .",
    "nonetheless , we calculate mass estimates for different radii ( using the pme and assuming isotropic orbits ) since the kinematics of the two outer clusters might be influenced by the nearby giant s0 .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : massrad ] .    combining the former findings with the photometry of @xcite , who found total magnitudes @xmath57 mag and @xmath58 mag , we estimate rough mass - to - light ratios for different radii . applying a king profile @xcite with the parameters",
    "@xmath5914.4  and @xmath601.4 @xcite we obtain at the outermost globular - cluster projected radius @xmath61  ( @xmath62 kpc ) m / l@xmath63 with a @xmath64 uncertainty due to statistical sample - size uncertainties and photometric errors . the systematic error due to distance uncertainties of ngc 3115 dw1 is @xmath65 . going inwards , the m / l@xmath66 ratio drops . at a projected radius of @xmath67   ( @xmath68 kpc )",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is m / l@xmath69 .",

    "they derive a m / l@xmath66 of @xmath73 within @xmath70 . a gradient of m / l@xmath66",
    "can therefore be traced outward from the center of the galaxy , although the uncertainties are quite large .",
    "however , all values fit well into the range given by @xcite for dwarf elliptical galaxies ( m / l@xmath74 for fornax up to m / l@xmath75 for ursa minor ) .      using the maximum - likelihood method of @xcite we measure a marginal net rotation of @xmath76 km s@xmath20 for the globular cluster system of ngc 3115 dw1 .",
    "note that to date no de was reported to show significant rotation of its stellar body @xcite .",
    "the position angle of the rotation axis is @xmath77 ( poorly defined given the weak rotation ) .",
    "this result may be of course biased by the incomplete spatial coverage of our small sample .",
    "correcting for the net rotation we obtain a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath78 km s@xmath20 for the full sample of 7 clusters , and @xmath79 km s@xmath20 for the inner 5 clusters .",
    "the major axis of the de1,n galaxy of @xmath80 @xcite appears at face value nearly _",
    "parallel _ to the rotation axis of the gcs although the latter is not well defined as mentioned above .",
    "spectroscopy for more clusters with better spatial coverage is certainly needed to establish the axis alignment .",

    "for consistency with other work we continue to use this convolution throughout our analysis despite the fact that the diffusion correction has been derived only for the f555w filter and is thought to be wavelength dependent .",
    "five king profiles were generated with core radii in the range @xmath119 pix ( @xmath120 pc ) .",
    "in addition , we generated hst - psfs for both our identified globular clusters using individual specifications ( e.g. filter , chip , chip position ) .",

    "27% of milky - way globular clusters have core radii larger than 2.1 pc @xcite and 10% have sizes in the range defined by the errors of the ngc 3115 dw1 clusters .",

    ", these authors find typical half - light radii of @xmath125 pc and @xmath126 pc for globular clusters in ngc 3115 and m87 , respectively .",
    "in section [ ln : rotdisp ] , we derived a high globular cluster velocity dispersion , and thus a high galaxy mass , when we included the two outermost globular clusters .",
    "the high mass is not unexpected given the bright absolute magnitude of ngc 3115 dw1 . based on its @xmath127 mag @xcite , ngc 3115",
    "dw1 falls in the transition region between dwarfs and ellipticals in the mass - luminosity relation of @xcite ( see fig .  3 therein ) .",
    "its high mass ( @xmath128m@xmath3 ) and the high velocity dispersion ( @xmath78 km s@xmath20 , see below ) are more consistent with an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we therefore discuss whether the two outermost clusters could be in the process of being stripped by the nearby giant s0 galaxy ngc 3115 .",
    "figure [ ps : fov ] and table [ tab : specphot ] show that 2 ( l1 and l63 ) of the 7 globular clusters have significantly larger projected radii , i.e. 161.4  ( @xmath129 kpc , l1 ) and 189.4  ( @xmath130 kpc , l63 ) , than the `` inner '' ( @xmath131@xmath132 kpc ) globular clusters .",

    "we expect no contamination from globular clusters of the nearby galaxy ngc 3115 .",
    "@xcite found the surface density over - abundance of globular clusters around ngc 3115 ( power - law index of radial distribution @xmath138 ) disappearing at 6  radius from the center of ngc 3115 ( at a photometric limit of @xmath139 mag ) .",

    "the extrapolated gc surface density of ngc 3115 dw1 at this position lies between 0.2 and 6.9 gcs arcmin@xmath94 , given the large uncertainties on the density profile .",
    "as the numbers are too small ( we only found 2 clusters to the north and 0 to the south ) it can not statistically be concluded whether the two globular clusters found in the northern field are chance detections or a statistically significant overabundance .    assuming that both galaxies are roughly at the same distance",
    ", we can estimate the dwarf galaxy s gravitational potential and the ratio of potentials of ngc 3115 dw1 and ngc 3115 .",
    "both globular clusters are at about 1/5 of the distance separating ngc 3115 dw1 and ngc 3115 . as a rough estimate",
    ", we assume that ngc 3115 dw1 and ngc 3115 have similar m / l@xmath66 . in this case",
    ", the ratio of their @xmath10 s would imply that ngc 3115 has a mass 10 times larger than ngc 3115 dw1 .",
    "hence , the gravitational potentials are comparable at the projected position of the distant globular clusters ( l1 and l63 ) . since the mass of ngc 3115 is likely to be higher than the adopted value ( assuming an extended dark matter halo )",
    "the motion of both globular clusters is no longer dominated by the gravitational potential of ngc 3115 dw1 alone . both clusters",
    "could then be considered as intergalactic globular clusters .",
    "note that stripping of globular clusters appears to be common among interacting galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that four globular clusters of the sagittarius dsph are in the process of being stripped by the milky way and are being added to its globular cluster system .",
    "other studies have indicated that stripping may be important in galaxy clusters ( e.g. in the fornax cluster @xcite 1999 , @xcite 1999 ) .",
    "however , there are no other ( optical ) hints of interaction from ngc 3115 dw1 s stellar light . @xcite found the isophotes to be consistent with little or no tidal disruption out to a projected radius of 60(corresponding to 3.2 kpc ) where their photometric errors start to dominate .",
    "a simple test for the stripping hypothesis would be a wide - field study of the system in order to rule out ( spectroscopically ) the presence of any similar clusters around ngc 3115 dw1 .      a look at the fundamental plane of dwarf elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that ngc 3115 dw1 fits reasonably well into the relation for dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies , under their assumption of @xmath142 mag .",
    "adopting the absolute magnitude of @xmath8 mag @xcite the galaxy falls slightly off the relation and would imply a higher velocity dispersion than measured in the central 3 . with the measured velocity dispersion of @xmath79 km s@xmath20 for the 5 globular clusters inside @xmath143  ( @xmath144 kpc ) we obtain from the fundamental - plane relation of @xcite an absolute magnitude of @xmath145 mag .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion for the total sample of 7 clusters inside @xmath146  ( @xmath147 kpc ) of @xmath78 km s@xmath20 , would correspond to far brighter absolute magnitude ( @xmath148 mag ) than the measured @xmath8 mag .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by a close encounter and subsequent stripping of the dwarf galaxy s halo by the nearby s0 galaxy ngc 3115 .",
    "stripping of outer halo regions might well have introduced violent perturbations and led to an enhanced velocity dispersion of the halo region ( which is traced by the globular clusters ) .",
    "the relaxation time of such a system far exceeds the hubble time @xcite and therefore it is not possible to reject this scenario just from considerations of dynamical timescales .",
    "alternatively , a high velocity dispersion in the outskirts of a galaxy could be due to a dark - matter dominated massive halo .",
    "the outer parts of a number of lower - luminosity local group galaxies are known to be dominated by dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this picture could explain the fact that we measure an uncommonly high mass for a dwarf elliptical ( see sec .",
    "[ ln : massestimate ] ) at a projected radius of 189.4  ( @xmath130 kpc ) .",
    "we can not discriminate between the above possibilities at this point .",
    "using lris multi - slit spectra we confirm , on the basis of their radial velocities , 7 of the 46 objects in our spectroscopic sample as bona - fide globular clusters associated with the bright ( @xmath8 mag ) de1,n galaxy , ngc 3115 dw1 .",
    "we verify the findings of @xcite ( within a projected radius of @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath90 kpc ) who derived the specific frequency @xmath99 and a total globular cluster population size @xmath96 .",
    "the spectroscopic verification of foreground and background contamination indicates that no revision of these results is necessary .",
    "ngc 3115 dw1 remains a de , n galaxy with a somewhat high @xmath149 value .",
    "a mass estimate using the projected mass estimator ( pme ) for isotropic globular cluster orbits yields a total galaxy mass of @xmath150 ( with the error being the internal uncertainty of the mass estimation code ) inside a radius @xmath53  ( @xmath54 kpc ) and @xmath151 inside @xmath131(@xmath152 kpc ) .",
    "this estimate is a lower mass limit ( see [ ln : massestimate ] ) and assumes that the outer globular clusters are not influenced by the nearby giant s0 ngc 3115 . using two mass estimators ( i.e.  pme and vme , see sect .",
    "[ ln : massestimate ] ) and various assumptions for the systemic velocity and the cluster orbits , we derive masses between @xmath153m@xmath3 and @xmath5 m@xmath3 .",

    "however , we can not at present exclude the possibility that the high velocity dispersion is due to stripping of the two outer clusters by the nearby giant companion .",
