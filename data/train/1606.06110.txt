    "the coupled electron - nuclear dynamics of molecules near metal surfaces underlie many electrochemical phenomena , and have gained a lot of interest recently .",
    "for example , vibrational promoted electron transfer and vibrational relaxation for no molecules scattering from gold surface have been reported @xcite experimentally and followed up by many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "coupled electron - nuclear dynamics also play an important role in molecular junctions , and are presumed to account for a great deal of exotic phenomena , including inelastic scattering signatures @xcite , hysteresis @xcite , vibrational heating and cooling @xcite .    in the presence of metal surfaces , a manifold of electronic degrees of freedom ( dofs ) take part in the dynamics , such that no simple solution is obvious .",
    "one attempt to simplify the dynamics is to treat the electronic bath as a source of friction for the nuclear dofs .",
    "@xcite decades ago , head - gordon and tully ( hgt ) derived a model for electronic friction based on a smeared view of derivative couplings in the adiabatic limit .",
    "@xcite such a formalism has been used successfully in many systems @xcite and yet apparently fails in other cases .",
    "@xcite following a non - equilibrium green s function and scattering matrix approach , von oppen and co - workers have given an alternative formalism for electronic friction , one which can be generalized to the out of equilibrium case .",
    "@xcite similar results are reported from other approaches .",
    "@xcite in a recent paper , we showed that a classical master equation gives the same friction as von oppen s model , provided the level broadening can be discarded .",
    "@xcite in that same paper , we also showed the connection between the hgt and von oppen s model of friction , both of which share several common features as well as some differences .",
    "it should be emphasized that von oppen s friction model relies on a constant molecule - metal coupling . for many systems such as gas molecule scattering from metal surface problem",
    ", molecule - metal couplings clearly depend on nuclear coordinates . in this paper",
    ", we will generalize von oppen s model to include such non - condon effects , and give a compact form of electronic friction in general .",
    "interestingly , similar results for friction have previously been derived using purely time - dependent formalisms ( without any nuclear motion ) @xcite ; in fact , our final form of friction can be viewed as a generalization of the hgt model to nonzero temperature ; see appendix [ app : hgt ] . in the present article",
    ", we will go beyond previous work by showing that non - condon frictional terms come along with additional non - condon contributions to the random force . at equilibrium ,",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is satisfied automatically .",
    "finally and perhaps most importantly , one finds non - condon effects change the potential of mean force and these changes can be very large .",
    "one shortcoming of our analysis here is that we restrict ourselves to the adiabatic regime , whereby we assume the nuclear motion is much slower than the electronic motion .",
    "now , over the past year , we have argued that it is possible to construct a broadened classical master equation valid in both non - adiabatic and adiabatic regimes .",
    "@xcite that being said , we will show below that incorporating non - condon effects is nontrivial in practice and can be done most easily with only a partial treatment ( whereby only the contribution to the mean force is incorporated ) .",
