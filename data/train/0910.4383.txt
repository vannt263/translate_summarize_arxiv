    "* ) might open the possibility of a more efficient evaluation in the future . in order to have an accurate and fast representation of the cosmological recombination history as a function of the cosmological parameters , two possible approaches",

    "the second approach is the so - called rico code ( fcrw09 ) , which provides an accurate representation of the recombination history by using a regression scheme based on pico @xcite .",
    "the rico code smoothly interpolates the @xmath17 function on a set of pre - computed recombination histories for different cosmologies , where @xmath18 is the redshift and @xmath19 represents the set of cosmological parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results for parameter estimations using rico with the most recent training set presented in fcrw09 .",
    "this permits us to accurately account for the full cosmological dependence of the corrections to the recombination history that were included in the multi - level recombination code which was used for the training of rico ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : rico ] for more details ) . with this tool , we have evaluated the impact of the corrections on the posterior probability distributions that are expected to be obtained for the planck satellite , by performing a complete monte carlo markov chain analysis .",
    "the study of these posteriors have shown that the impact of the cosmology dependence is not very relevant for those processes included into the current rico training set .",
    "therefore , by assuming that the cosmology dependence of the correction in general can be neglected , we have also investigated the impact of recent improvements in the treatment of hydrogen recombination ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : lya ] ) .",
    "the basic conclusion is that , with our current understanding of the recombination process , the expected biases in the cosmological parameters inferred from planck might be as large as 1.5 - 2.5 sigmas for some parameters as the baryon density or the primordial spectral index of scalar fluctuations , if all these corrections to the recombination history are neglected .",

    "in this section we provide an updated overview on the important physical processes during cosmological recombination which have been discussed in the literature so far .",
    "we start with a short summary of those processes which are already included into the current training set ( fcrw09 ) of rico ( sect .  [",

    "the corresponding correction to the ionization history close to the maximum of the thomson visibility function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : remaining_xe ] .",
    "we then explain the main recent advances in connection with the radiative transfer calculations during hydrogen recombination ( sect .",
    "[ sec : lya ] ) , which lead to another important correction to the cosmological ionization history ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : remaining_xe ] ) that is not yet included into the current training set of rico .",
    "however , as we explain below ( sect .",
    "3.4 ) it is possible to take these corrections into account ( sect .  4 ) , provided that their cosmology dependence is negligible .",
    "our computations show that this may be a valid approximation ( sect .",
    "we end this section mentioning a few processes that have been recently addressed but seem to be of minor importance in connection with parameter estimations for planck .",
    "overall it seems that the list of processes that could be of importance in connection with planck is nearly completed .",
    "however , still some effort has to go in cross - validation of the results obtained by different groups .",
    "as demonstrated in fcrw09 , rico can be used to represent the recombination history of the universe , accurately capturing the full cosmology dependence and physical model of the multilevel recombination code that was used in the computations of the rico training set . for the current rico training",
    "set we ran our full recombination code using a @xmath20-shell model for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the physical processes which are included during hydrogen recombination are described in detail in fcrw09 : the induced 2s-1s two - photon decay @xcite ; the feedback of lyman @xmath21 photons on the 1s-2s absorption rate @xcite ; the non - equilibrium populations in the angular momentum sub - states @xcite ; and the effect of lyman series feedback @xcite . for helium recombination we took into account : the spin - forbidden he  i @xmath22 transition @xcite ; and the acceleration of helium recombination by neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also updated our physical constants according to the nist database , including the new value of the gravitational constant and the helium to hydrogen mass ratio @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the physical processes that were taken into account in the current rico training set can be found in fcrw09 .",
    "this rico training set is now publicly available at ` http://cosmos.astro.uiuc.edu/rico ` .",
    "radiative transfer effects @xcite ( dot - dashed ) ; the effect of raman scattering @xcite ( dashed ) ; and the combination of all previous effects ( solid line ) . ]    , but for the angular power spectrum ( aps ) .",
    "for the fiducial cosmological model , it is shown the correction to the aps due to the recombination history which is incorporated in the new rico training set ( gray lines ) , and the correction due to the additional inclusion of ly@xmath21 radiative transfer effects @xcite and raman scattering @xcite ( dark lines ) . ]      as already pointed out earlier ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in particular a detailed treatment of the hydrogen lyman @xmath21 radiative transfer problem including two - photon corrections is expected to lead to an important additional modification during hydrogen recombination .",
    "an overview of the relevant physical aspects in connection with this problem was already given in sect .",
    "2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of fcrw09 .",
    "however , at that time the problem was still not solved at full depth , but recently several important steps were taken , which here we now want to discuss briefly ( for additional overview see also * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the effect of partial frequency redistribution on the lyman @xmath21 escape rate and the ionization history during hydrogen recombination was independently studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the _ atomic recoil _ effect leads to the dominant contribution to the associated correction in the ionization history , and the result for this process alone seems to be in good agreement with the one obtained earlier by @xcite , leading to @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "also the computations by @xcite seem to support this conclusion .",
    "however , @xcite also included the effect of _ doppler broadening _ and _ doppler boosting _ , which was neglected in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "doppler boosting acts in the opposite direction as atomic recoil and therefore decelerates recombination , while the effect of doppler broadening can lead to both an increase in the photons escape probability or a decrease , depending on the initial frequency of the photons ( see * ? ? ? * for more detailed explanation ) .",
    "the overall correction to the recombination history due to line scattering amounts to @xmath25 at @xmath24 .",
    "the results of @xcite seem to be rather similar to those of @xcite , however a final comparison will become necessary in order to reach full agreement on the final correction . in the computations presented below",
    "we will use the results of @xcite .",
    "initially , the problem of two - photon transitions from highly excited levels in hydrogen and helium was proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , for hydrogen recombination only very recently this problem has been solved convincingly by @xcite and @xcite , using two independent , conceptually different approaches . also until now",
    ", @xcite took the main contribution coming from the 3d-1s and 3s-1s two - photon profile corrections into account , while @xcite also included the @xmath26s-1s and @xmath26d-1s two - photon profile corrections for larger @xmath26 .    in the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "_ three independent _ sources for the corrections in connection with the two - photon picture were identified ( we will discuss the other two processes in sect .  [",
    "sec : thermo ] and [ sec : time ] ) . as they explain",
    ", the total modification coming from _ purely _ quantum mechanical aspects of the problem ( i.e. corrections due to deviations of the line profiles from the normal lorenzian shape , as pointed out by @xcite ) leads to a change in the free electron number of @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "it also seems clear that the remaining small difference ( at the level of @xmath29 ) between the results of @xcite and @xcite for the total correction related to the two - photon decays from excited states is because @xcite only included the full two - photon profiles of the 3s-1s and 3d-1s channels . below",
    "we will use the results of @xcite for this process .",
    "one of the key ingredients for the derivation of the escape probability in the lyman @xmath21 resonance using the sobolev approximation @xcite is the _ quasi - stationarity _ of the line transfer problem .",
    "however , as shown recently @xcite at the percent - level this assumption is not justified during the recombination of hydrogen , since ( i ) the ionization degree , expansion rate of the universe and lyman @xmath21 death probability change over a characteristic time @xmath30 , and ( ii ) because a significant contribution to the total escape probability is coming from photons emitted in the distant wings ( comparable to @xmath31 doppler width ) of the lyman @xmath21 resonance .",
    "therefore , one has to include _ time - dependent aspects _ in the emission and absorption process into the line transfer problem , leading to a delay of recombination by @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "below we will use the results of @xcite .      as explained by @xcite ,",
    "the largest correction related to the two - photon formulation of the lyman @xmath21 transfer problem is due to the _ frequency - dependent asymmetry _ between the emission and absorption profile around the lyman @xmath21 resonance .",
    "this asymmetry is given by a thermodynamic correction factor , which has an exponential dependence on the detuning from the line center , i.e. @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 is the transition frequency for the lyman @xmath21 resonance .",
    "usually this factor can be neglected , since for most astrophysical problems the main contribution to the number of photons is coming from within a few doppler width of the line center , where the thermodynamic factor indeed is very close to unity . however , in the lyman @xmath21 escape problem during hydrogen recombination contributions from the very distant damping wings are also important @xcite , so that there @xmath36 has to be included .    as explained in @xcite , the thermodynamic factor also",
    "can be obtained in the classical picture , using the _ detailed balance principle_. however , in the two - photon picture this factor has a natural explanation in connection with the absorption of photons from the cmb blackbody ambient radiation field @xcite .",
    "this process leads to a @xmath37 increase in the lyman @xmath21 escape probability , and hence accelerates hydrogen recombination . for the correction to the ionization history ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath38 at @xmath28 .",
    "note also that in the analysis of @xcite the thermodynamic correction factor was included for all @xmath26s-1s and @xmath26d-1s channels with @xmath39 .",
    "below we will use the results of @xcite for this process .",
    "@xcite also studied the effect of raman scatterings on the recombination dynamics , leading to an additional delay of hydrogen recombination by @xmath40 at @xmath24 . here in particular the correction due to 2s-1s raman scatterings",
    "is important .",
    "again it is expected that a large part of this correction can be attributed to time - dependent aspects and the correct formulation using detailed balance , and we are currently investigating this process in detail . in the computations",
    "presented below we will use the results of @xcite for the effect of raman scatterings .",
    "there are a few more processes that here we only want mention very briefly ( although with this the list is not meant to be absolutely final or complete ) , and which we did not account for in the computations presented here .",
    "however , it is expected that their contribution will not be very important .",
    "the effect of _ electron scattering _ during hydrogen recombination was also recently investigated by @xcite using a fokker - planck approach .",
    "this approximation for the frequency redistribution function may not be sufficient towards the end of hydrogen recombination , but in the overall correction to the ionization history was very small close the maximum of the thomson visibility function , so that no big difference are expected when more accurately using a scattering kernel - approach .",
    "very recently @xcite showed that this statement indeed seems to be correct .",
    "very recently @xcite investigated the feedback problem of helium photons including the processes of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 feedback .",
    "they found that only @xmath41 feedback leads to some small correction ( @xmath45 at @xmath46 ) in the ionization history , while all the other helium feedback induced corrections are negligible .",
    "this is because the @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath44 feedback processes all occur in the _ pre - recombinational epochs _ of the considered species , where the populations of the levels are practically in full equilibrium with the free electrons and ions .",
    "the @xmath41 feedback process was already studied by @xcite , but the result obtained by @xcite seems to be smaller .",
    "however , it is clear that any discrepancy in the helium recombination history at the 0.1% - 0.2% level will not be very important for the analysis of future cmb data .",
    "we would also like to mention , that although the @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath44 feedback processes do not affect the ionization history , they do introduce interesting changes in the recombinational radiation , increasing the total contribution of photons from helium by 40% - 70% @xcite .",
    "recently , several additional processes during hydrogen recombination were discussed .",
    "these include : the overlap of lyman series resonances caused by the thermal motion of the atoms @xcite ; quadrupole transitions in hydrogen @xcite ; hydrogen deuterium recombination @xcite ; and 3s-2s and 3d-2s two - photon transitions @xcite .",
    "all these processes seem to affect the ionization history of the universe at a level ( well ) below 0.1% .",
    "furthermore , one should include the small re - absorption of photons from the 2s-1s two - photon continuum close to the lyman @xmath21 resonance , where our estimates show that this leads to another @xmath49 correction .",
    "figure  [ fig : remaining_xe ] shows the current best - estimate of the remaining overall correction to the recombination history , while fig .",
    "[ fig : remaining_aps ] translates these corrections into changes of the angular power spectrum . to describe the ly-@xmath21 transfer effects",
    ", we adopt the curve presented in @xcite , which includes the results of the processes investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also include the effect of raman scattering on hydrogen recombination as described in @xcite .",
    "it seems that the remaining uncertainty due to processes that were not taken into account here can still exceed the 0.1% level , but likely will not lead to any significant addition anymore .",
    "however , it is clear that a final rigorous comparison of the total result from different independent groups will become necessary to assure that the accuracy required for the analysis of planck data will be reached . such detailed code comparison is currently under discussion .",
    "here , the rico code together with the latest training set described above is used to evaluate the impact of the recombination uncertainties in the cosmological parameter constraints inferred from cmb experiments .",
    "all our analyses use the software packages camb @xcite and cosmomc @xcite .",
    "camb is used to calculate the linear - theory cmb angular power spectrum , and has been modified here to include the recombination history as described by rico .",
    "cosmomc uses a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method to sample the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters from a given likelihood function which describes the experimental constraints on the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "the default parametrization which is included inside cosmomc exploits some of the intrinsic degeneracies in the cmb angular power spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and uses as basic parameters the following subset : @xmath50 here , @xmath4 and @xmath8 are the ( physical ) baryon and dark matter densities respectively , where @xmath51 stands for the hubble constant in units of 100  km  s@xmath52  mpc@xmath52 ; @xmath53 is the acoustic horizon angular scale ; @xmath7 is the thomson optical depth to reionization ; and @xmath3 and @xmath54 are the spectral index and the amplitude of the primordial ( adiabatic ) scalar curvature perturbation power spectrum at a certain scale @xmath55 . for the computations in this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath56  mpc@xmath52 .",
    "it is important to note that the above parametrization @xmath57 makes use of an approximate formula for the sound horizon @xcite , which used in its derivation some knowledge on the recombination history provided by recfast .",
    "therefore , the use of this parameter is not appropriate if we are changing the recombination history , as this might introduce artificial biases . for this reason , in this paper",
    "we have modified cosmomc to use a new parametrization @xmath58 , which is defined as @xmath59 where we have replaced @xmath53 by @xmath60 as a basic parameter . in this way",
    ", we still exploit some of the well - known degeneracies ( e.g. that between @xmath7 and @xmath54 ) , but we eliminate the possible uncertainties which may arise from the use of @xmath53 , at the expense of decreasing slightly the speed at which the chain converges . as we show below ,",
    "both the shape of the posteriors and the confidence levels for the rest of the parameters is practically unaffected by this modification in the parametrization , despite of the fact that the cosmomc code now assumes a flat prior on @xmath60 instead of a flat prior on @xmath53 . a modified version of the ` params.f90 ` subroutine inside cosmomc which uses this new parametrization is also available in the rico webpage .",
    "finally , concerning the convergence of the chains , all computations throughout this paper were obtained using at least five independent chains ; those chains have been run until the @xcite convergence criterion @xmath61 yields a value smaller than @xmath62 for the minimal ( 6-parameter ) case , and values smaller than @xmath63 for those cases with a larger number of parameters .      for the case of planck satellite ,",
    "the mock data is prepared as follows .",
    "we assume a gaussian symmetric beam , and the noise is taken to be uniform across the sky . for definiteness",
    ", we have adopted the nominal values of the beam and pixel noise which correspond to the 143  ghz planck band , as described in @xcite .",
    "thus , we have @xmath64 , @xmath65  @xmath66k@xmath67 and @xmath68  @xmath66k@xmath67 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 indicate the intensity and polarization sensitivities , respectively . note that using a single frequency channel",
    "is implicitly assuming that the remaining planck frequencies have been used to fully remove the foreground contamination from this reference 143  ghz channel .",
    "for a complete discussion on which combination of planck channels is more appropriate in terms of the parameter constraints , see @xcite .",
    "the fiducial cosmological model used for these computations corresponds to the wmap5 cosmology @xcite , and has parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and an amplitude @xmath76 at @xmath77  mpc@xmath52 ( or equivalently , @xmath78 at @xmath79  mpc@xmath52 , or @xmath80 ) .",
    "the mock data is then produced using the cosmological recombination history as computed with our complete multi - level recombination code for this particular cosmology ( using @xmath81 shells to model the hydrogen atom ) .",
    "the shape of the likelihood function adopted here corresponds to the exact full - sky gaussian likelihood function given in @xcite , which is implemented in cosmomc using the ` all_l_exact ` format for the data .",

    "the running of the spectral index is a possible extension to the simple @xmath6cdm model which is under debate in the literature in light of wmap observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * which gives @xmath84 ) .",

    "for this computation , we considered a 7-parameter model by adding @xmath85 , which again is computed at the same pivot scale of @xmath56  mpc@xmath52 . when studying the one - dimensional posterior distributions for all parameters , we find that the inclusion of @xmath86 does not affect the shape of the rest of the posteriors .",
    "the bias on @xmath86 due to recombination uncertainties is not very significant ( changes from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 sigmas ) but has to be taken into account .    for completeness",

    "[ fig : tensors ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] are not affected by the inclusion of the other parameter .    , but in the @xmath3-@xmath86 plane . ]",
    "another possible extension of the minimal six - parameter model is to constrain simultaneously the spatial curvature , @xmath90 .",
    "the inclusion of this additional parameter introduces a practical complication , since in our new parametrization @xmath58 ( eq .  [ eq : newpar ] ) , the @xmath60 parameter is highly correlated with @xmath90 .",
    "[ fig : omk ] presents the posterior distributions for this case , in which the degeneration between @xmath60 and @xmath90 is clearly visible .",
    "there are two things to note .",
    "first , there is no significant bias to @xmath90 due to the inclusion of recombination uncertainties , as one would expect since this parameter is mainly constrained by information at angular scales around the first doppler peak .",
    "second , the shape of the remaining posteriors and the biases to the parameters are not significantly affected by the inclusion of this additional parameter .          one common extension of the minimal model is the inclusion of some parameters describing the residual contribution of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) clusters or point sources which are left in the maps after the component separation processes . for the case of planck satellite , these",
    "are known to be the major contaminants at small angular scales ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for illustration ,",
    "here we will consider the case of the residual sz cluster contribution .",
    "one of the simplest parametrizations of the sz contribution to the angular power spectrum is to used a fixed template from numerical simulations , and fit for the relative amplitude by using an additional parameter , @xmath91 .",
    "this approach is similar to the one used in @xcite , where they parametrize the sz contribution by the model of @xcite but allowing for a different normalization through the @xmath91 parameter .",
    "when the parameter constraints are infered with the inclusion of this additional parameter , we find that ( neglecting the intrinsic bias due to the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath91 ) the relative bias is practically not affected .",
    "in particular , we obtain a bias of -1.42 , -0.44 , -2.09 and -1.03 sigmas for @xmath4 , @xmath60 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "those numbers are comparable to the net biases which have been obtained for the minimal model in table  [ tab : planck2 ] .",
    "one would expect that the order of magnitude of the corrections to the recombination history discussed in previous sections ( at the level of 1%-2% ) would have a negligible impact on the parameters constraints that we would infer from present - day cmb experiments . as shown in fcrw09 ,",
    "the changes introduced in the power spectra ( both temperature and polarization ) are significant at high multipoles , in the sense that they are larger than the benchmark level estimated as @xmath15 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to quantify this fact , we have obtained the posterior distributions for the case of the minimal model with six free parameters , combining the cmb information from wmap5 @xcite , acbar @xcite , cbi @xcite and boomerang @xcite , together with measurements on the linear matter power spectrum based on luminous red galaxies from sdss - dr4 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmap ] presents the results for the case of using the standard recfast recombination history , together with the case of using our most complete description of the recombination history , as presented in the previous section .",
    "as expected , the modifications on the shape of the posteriors are very small and no biases are seen in the parameters except for @xmath3 and @xmath5 , which are slightly biased .",
    "our analysis including the full description of the recombination history gives @xmath92 and @xmath93 , while the result using recfast v1.4.2 gives @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in other words , this is a @xmath96 and @xmath97 sigma bias on @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively . for completeness",
    ", we have run also the mcmc for the case of using wmap5 data alone . in that case",
    ", the bias decreases to @xmath98 sigmas for those two parameters .",
    "in this section , we now discuss the results presented in this paper focusing in three particular aspects . on one hand",
    ", we discuss the robustness of our results against possible modifications of the physical description of the recombination process .",
    "second , we also consider the dependence of the obtained biases if additional parameters are included in the mcmc analysis .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible impact of recombination uncertainties on the results obtained from other cosmological probes different from cmb anisotropies .      as discussed above ( sect .",
    "[ sec : physics ] ) , there is a wide agreement in the community about the list of physical processes which should be included in the description of the cosmological recombination process . in many cases ,",
    "these physical processes have been treated separately by at least two separate groups , and the agreement on the signs and amplitudes of the corrections is excellent in most of the cases ( e.g. see the compilation of uncertainties in the physics of recombination in table  2.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "although an agreement at the level of @xmath99% is still not reached , we are almost there , as the remaining uncertainties seem to be at the level of 0.1%-0.3% between the different groups . in this sense",
    ", one would expect that a code which includes self - consistently all those processes should obtain essentially the same biases that have been described in sect .",
    "[ sec : additional ] , and have been reported in table  [ tab : planck2 ] .    however , apart from the processes described in section  [ sec : addproc ] , there are still some possible uncertainties which might lead to measurable biases on the cosmological parameters .",
    "below we now briefly address them .",
    "one effect which might lead to additional biases on the cosmological parameters is the inclusion of very high-@xmath26 states in the cosmological hydrogen recombination .",
    "the computations in this paper are based on a training set which uses @xmath81 shells to describe the hydrogen atom . to explore the dependence of higher number of shells",
    ", we have repeated the standard six - parameter computation for the mock planck data presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : planck_alone ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : additional ] , but taking as a reference model the one computed using @xmath100 hydrogen shells , and trying to recover it with rico ( which uses @xmath81 hydrogen shells ) . the recovered posteriors using the rico code in this case do not show _ any appreciable _ bias in any of six parameters of the minimal model .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_fullcode ] , where we present the posterior distribution for the @xmath3 parameter , which is the one having the largest bias .",
    "parameter due to the inclusion of additional number of shells in the description of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the black solid line has been obtained from a fiducial model with @xmath100 hydrogen shells .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the posterior distribution recovered using the rico code only , with a training set based on @xmath81 shells .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the posterior distribution recovered using the current recfast code . note that we did not include for this computation the corrections due to ly-@xmath21 radiative transfer and raman scattering . ]      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : addproc ] , and discussed in fcrw09 , we do not expect major changes in our current understanding of the helium recombination , at a level which might be relevant for the computation of cmb anisotropies .",
    "this statement assumes that the uncertainties in the modelling of the helium atom are well controlled , but , as described in @xcite , we still lack an accurate description of the photoionization cross - sections , energies or transition rates for the helium atom , which might lead to small changes in these results .",
    "one may also wonder whether the small differences found for the correction caused by helium feedback processes ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : feedbackhe ] ) could matter .    by far , the most relevant correction to the helium recombination history is caused by the absorption of photons by neutral hydrogen ,",
    "although the inclusion of the @xmath101-@xmath102 intercombination line also gives some contribution .",
    "these two effects are already included in the codes , both in rico ( fcrw09 ) and in recfast v1.4.2 @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we have also quantified for this paper the impact that these two corrections to the helium recombination would have on the recovered cosmological parameters .",
    "our computations show that , if these corrections are not included ( which in practise corresponds to setting ` recfast_heswitch ` = 0 in recfast v1.4.2 , or equivalently , using recfast v1.3 ) , then the resulting biases on the parameters are found to be -3.2 , -2.0 ,",
    "-1.2 and -0.7 sigmas for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath60 , respectively . for illustration , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_oldrecfast ] a comparison of the posterior distribution obtained for the @xmath3 parameter when using the recfast code with ( ` recfast_heswitch ` = 6 ) and without ( ` recfast_heswitch ` = 0 ) all the corrections to the helium recombination .",
    "this simple computation shows that additional corrections to the helium recombination history at the @xmath103 level will not matter much to the analysis of future planck data .",
    "therefore , the physics of helium recombination already seems to be captured at a sufficient level of precision , when including the acceleration caused by the hydrogen continuum opacity and the @xmath101-@xmath102 intercombination line , which together lead to a @xmath104 correction to @xmath105 at @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "parameter for different modellings of the helium recombination history .",
    "the black solid line corresponds to the posterior distribution recovered using the rico code and the additional corrections used in sec .",
    "[ sec : additional ] .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the posterior distribution recovered using the current recfast code ( v1.4.2 ) , while the dashed line uses the same version of the code but without any correction to the helium recombination history . ]",
    "in addition to those extended models described in sect .  [ sec : extendedmodels ] , there is a number of possible non - standard models for which the inclusion of refined recombination physics might be of importance . for example , when using current cmb data to constrain the presence of hypothetical sources of ly@xmath21 resonance radiation or ionizing photons at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or to probe dark matter models with large annihilation cross - section ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or energy release by long - lived unstable particles @xcite ; or when exploring the variation of fundamental constants with time ( see e.g. @xcite for newton s gravitational constant , or @xcite for the fine structure constant and the higgs vacuum expectation value ) , it is obvious that neglecting physically well understood additions to the recombination model , as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : physics ] , could lead to _ spurious detections _ or _ confusion _ , in particular , when the possible effects are already known to be rather small ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * in the case of dark matter annihilations ) .",
    "more generally speaking , given that the largest recombination uncertainties are obtained for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one can say that any additional parameter showing a strong correlation with those three might be biased if an incomplete description of the recombination physics is used . in this sense , neglecting the refinements to the recombination model could be as important as not taking into account , for instance , uncertainties in the beam shapes , which also have been shown to compromise our ability to measure @xmath3 @xcite ; or the combined effect of beam and calibration uncertainties , which introduce significant biases to @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , although other parameters ( like @xmath90 ) are essentially not affected because these are basically constrained by the position of the peaks , and not by their amplitudes .",
    "the combination of cmb data with other datasets usually helps to improve the parameter constraints , in some cases by breaking internal degeneracies which are inherent to the cmb data alone .",
    "one of the commonly used external datasets is the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) . @xcite",
    "have recently shown that a possible delay of recombination @xcite by extra sources of ionizing or exciting photons leads to biases on the constraints from baos , because they largely rely on the determination of the size of the acoustic horizon at recombination .",
    "their conclusions can be directly translated here , stressing that a fully consistent combination of the constraints from cmb and baos should be done by using the same recombination history in both cases .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out that in principle one could reduce the uncertainty in our knowledge of the recombination epoch and its possible _ non - standard _ extensions ( e.g. due to annihilating dark matter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in two ways . on one hand",
    ", one could search for the imprint of the cosmological hydrogen recombination lines on the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite , which arises due to the resonant scattering of cmb photons by hydrogen atoms at each epoch @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one could also try to _ directly observe _ the photons that are emitted during the recombination epoch .",
    "today these photons should still be visible as small distortion of the cmb energy spectrum in the mm , cm and dm spectral bands ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations not only would open another possibility to determine some of the key cosmological parameters , such as the _ primordial helium abundance _ , the _ number density of baryons _ and the cmb _ monopole temperature _ at recombination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they would also allow us to _ directly _ check our understand of the recombination process and possible non - standard aspects ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * for an overview ) , for example , in connection with early energy release @xcite , or dark matter annihilations @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a mcmc analysis of the expected biases on the cosmological constraints to be derived from the upcoming planck data , in the light of recent developments in the description of the standard cosmological recombination process .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * an incomplete description of the cosmological recombination process leads to significant biases ( of several sigmas ) in some of the basic parameters to be constrained by planck satellite ( see table  [ tab : planck2 ] ) , and in general , by any future cmb experiment .",
    "however , these corrections have a minor impact for present - day cmb experiments ; for instance , using wmap5 data plus other cosmological datasets , we find a @xmath96 and @xmath107 sigma bias on @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively , while the rest of the parameters remain unchanged . * today",
    ", it seems that our understanding of cosmological recombination has reached the sub - percent level in @xmath108 at redshifts @xmath109 .",
    "however , it will be important to cross - validate all of the considered corrections in a detailed code comparison , which currently is under discussion among the different groups .",
    "* given the range of variation of the relevant cosmological parameters , it is possible to incorporate all the new recombination corrections by using ( cosmology independent ) fudge functions .",
    "here we described one possibility which uses a simple correction factor to the results obtained with recfast ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : corr_fac ] ) .",
    "we provide the function @xmath110 on the rico - webpage . *",
    "the physics of helium recombination already seems to be captured at a sufficient level of precision , when including the acceleration caused by the hydrogen continuum opacity and the @xmath101-@xmath102 intercombination line .",
    "the biases caused by neglecting only these corrections are -0.8 and -0.4 sigmas , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . *",
    "when allowing for more non - standard additions to the recombination model ( e.g. related to annihilating dark matter ) , the biases introduced by an inaccurate recombination model could lead to spurious detections or additional confusion ( see sect .",
