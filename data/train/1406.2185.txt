    "the traditional field of signal processing deals mostly with the analysis of time series .",
    "signal processing of time series relies heavily on integral transforms @xcite @xcite .",
    "three types of transforms have been used : linear , bilinear and tomograms . among the linear",
    "transforms fourier and wavelets are the most popular .",
    "the fourier transform extracts the frequency components of the signal and the wavelets its multiscale nature .",
    "however , this is achieved at the expense of the time information , in the sense that the time location of the frequency components and of the scale features is lost in the process .",
    "this motivated the development of bilinear transforms like the time - frequency wigner - ville @xcite @xcite or the frequency - scale bertrand @xcite @xcite quasidistributions .",
    "the aim of the wigner - ville transform was to provide joint information on the time - frequency plane , which is important because in many applications ( biomedical , seismic , radar , etc . )",
    "the signals are of finite ( sometimes very short ) duration . however , the oscillating cross - terms in the wigner  ville and other quasidistributions @xcite @xcite @xcite make the interpretation of the transformed signals a difficult matter . even when the average of the cross - terms is small , their amplitude may be greater than the signal in time ",
    "frequency regions that carry no physical information .",
    "the difficulties with the physical interpretation of quasidistributions arise from the fact that time and frequency ( or frequency and scale ) are noncommutative operator pairs .",
    "hence , a joint probability density can never be defined . even in the case of positive quasiprobabilities like the husimi",
    " kano function @xcite @xcite , an interpretation as a joint probability distribution is also not possible because the two arguments in the function are not simultaneously measurable random variables .",
    "more recently , a new type of strictly positive bilinear transform has been proposed @xcite @xcite @xcite , called a tomogram , which is a generalization of the radon transform @xcite to arbitrary noncommutative pairs of operators .",
    "the radon  wigner transform @xcite @xcite is a particular case of the noncommutative tomography technique . being strictly positive probability densities , the tomograms provide a full characterization of the signal and are robust in the presence of noise .",
    "a unified framework to characterize linear transforms , quasidistributions and tomograms was developed in ref.@xcite . in short , considering a signal @xmath0 as a vectors @xmath1 in a subspace @xmath2 of a hilbert space @xmath3 , a family of unitary operators @xmath4 and a reference vector @xmath5 in the dual @xmath6 of @xmath7 , a linear transform like fourier or wavelet is @xmath8and a quasidistribution is @xmath9    to define the tomogram let , in the unitary operator @xmath10 , @xmath11 have the spectral decomposition @xmath12 . then@xmath13denotes the projector on the ( generalized ) eigenvector @xmath14 of @xmath11 .",
    "the tomogram is @xmath15    the tomogram @xmath16 is the squared amplitude of the projection of the signal @xmath17 on the eigenvector @xmath18 of the operator @xmath19 .",
    "therefore it is positive . for normalized @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21the tomogram is normalized @xmath22and may be interpreted as a probability distribution on the set of generalized eigenvalues of @xmath11 , that is , as the probability distribution for the random variable @xmath23 corresponding to the observable defined by the operator @xmath11 .",
    "for example , if the unitary @xmath24 is generated by @xmath25 and @xmath5 is a ( generalized ) eigenvector of the time - translation operator , the linear transform @xmath26 is the fourier transform .",
    "for the same @xmath27 * * , * * the quasi - distribution * *  * * @xmath28 is the ambiguity function and the wigner ",
    "ville transform @xcite ville48 is the quasi - distribution @xmath28 for the following @xmath29operator @xmath30    the wavelet transform is @xmath26 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the dilation operator @xmath33 .",
    "the wavelets @xmath34 are kernel functions generated from a basic wavelet @xmath35 by means of a translation and a rescaling @xmath36 @xmath37 : @xmath38using the operator @xmath39@xmath40    the bertrand transform @xcite @xcite is the quasi - distribution @xmath28 for @xmath41 .",
    "linear , bilinear and tomogram transforms are related to one another @xcite .    as shown before ,",
    "tomograms are obtained from projections on the eigenstates of the @xmath42 operators .",
    "these operators may be linear combinations of different ( commuting or noncommuting ) operators , @xmath43meaning that the tomogram explores the signal along lines in the plane @xmath44 .",
    "for example for @xmath45the tomogram is the expectation value of a projection operator with support on a line in the time ",
    "frequency plane @xmath46therefore , @xmath47 is the marginal distribution of the variable @xmath23 along this line in the time  frequency plane .",
    "the line is rotated and rescaled when one changes the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in this way , the whole time ",
    "frequency plane is sampled and the tomographic transform contains all the information on the signal .",
    "the probabilistic nature of the tomogram implies that , in contrast with quasi - distributions , the information thus obtained is robust and unambiguous .",
    "tomograms associated to linear combinations of time with the generators of the conformal group ( @xmath50 ) and several other known operators have been explored @xcite .    by providing a robust extraction of compound signal features ,",
    "tomograms have been useful in denoising , component separation and structure identification @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite aguirre @xcite .",
    "social and economic networks , information networks , power grids , biological networks , etc .",
    "generate large sets of raw data from which , in general , only a detailed analysis may extract useful information .",
    "a first step is the construction of the appropriate signal transforms .    from the graph point of view",
    "a time series is a signal on a one - dimensional directed graph with vertices labelled by the times @xmath51 and the edges connecting @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "that is , the adjacency matrix @xmath54 of a time series is , in general@xmath55or , for a time - periodic signal@xmath56as discussed before , signal transforms for a time series are projections on a set of eigenvectors of some linear operator .",
    "these operators are not arbitrary , but chosen to extract particular features of the signal that is being analyzed .",
    "the fourier transform looks for periodic features , wavelets for multiscale features , etc .",
    "likewise , useful information from signals on arbitrary graphs may be obtained from projections on sets of vectors associated to suitably chosen linear operators . for the time - periodic signal , it is easy to see that the discrete fourier transform is the projection on the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix ( [ i.2 ] ) .",
    "therefore one may define the graph fourier transform for an arbitrary graph as the projection on the eigenvectors ( or on the generalized eigenvectors of the jordan decomposition ) of the adjacency matrix .",
    "this was the point of view taken by some authors @xcite to develop a theory of discrete signal processing on graphs .",
    "however this choice is not unique because , for the time series network other matrices have the same spectrum , for example the laplacian matrix@xmath57@xmath58 being the degree matrix , which for the time series is the identity .",
    "hence the graph fourier transform might as well be defined as a projection on the generalized eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix miller @xcite .",
    "this operator point of view allows not only to generalize the notion of transforms but also the notions of filtering and other general linear operations on graph signals .",
    "here a generalization of the notions of linear transform and tomogram for signals on graphs will be developed .",
    "generalization of the notion of bilinear transform will not be dealt with because , already for time series , it leads to difficult interpretation problems .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph , with @xmath60 the set of vertices and @xmath54 the weighted adjacency matrix .",
    "each matrix element @xmath61 is the weight of a directed edge from @xmath62 to @xmath63 which can take arbitrary real or complex values .",
    "@xmath64 is the neighborhood of @xmath63 and a graph signal is a map @xmath65 from the set @xmath66 of vertices into the set of complex numbers @xmath67 , each element @xmath68 being indexed by the vertex @xmath63 .",
    "other useful matrices are :    - _ the degree matrix _",
    "@xmath58 _ _ : _ _ a diagonal matrix listing the degree of the vertices    - _ the laplacian matrix : _ @xmath69    - _ the symmetrically normalized laplacian matrix : _ @xmath70    - _ the random walk matrix : _ @xmath71    - _ the lazy random walk matrix : _ @xmath72    - _ the incidence matrix _",
    "@xmath73 _ _ : _ _ is the @xmath74 matrix ( @xmath75=no . edges , @xmath76=no . of vertices ) given by@xmath77    - _ the edge adjacency matrix : _ is a @xmath78 matrix determined by the adjacencies of edges@xmath79    these matrices have been used in the past mostly to characterize the topological structure of networks , for vertex clustering , detection of communities , etc .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite hashimoto @xcite . here",
    "they will be considered as operators which generate a set of ( generalized ) eigenvectors to project the signals on graphs .",
    "* fourier - like transforms *    denote any one of these matrices by @xmath80 .",
    "the matrices @xmath80 act on the space of graph signals by@xmath81when the matrix @xmath80 is the adjacency matrix this operation generalizes the notion of time shift , when time sequences are looked at as forward - connected graphs .    for many real - world datasets the matrices @xmath80 are not diagonalizable .",
    "in those cases , to obtain a suitable set of expansion vectors one may either use the symmetric combinations @xmath82 and @xmath83 to generate an expansion basis or , alternatively , use the block - diagonal jordan decomposition of @xmath80.@xmath84@xmath85with jordan blocks associated to the eigenvalues of @xmath80@xmath86the columns of the matrix @xmath87 , that brings @xmath80 to its jordan normal form , are the eigenvectors@xmath88and the generalized eigenvectors of the jordan chain@xmath89of @xmath80 .",
    "these vectors may then be used to project the signals on the graph and , considering the graph signal @xmath90 as a column vector , the @xmath91transform is then@xmath92with inverse transform@xmath93    the problem with this decomposition lies in the fact that in general the set of generalized eigenvectors do not form an orthogonal basis .",
    "therefore it is sometimes more convenient to use @xmath82 and @xmath94 to generate the expansion basis , leading to what we will call the @xmath95 or @xmath96transform .",
    "* wavelet - like transforms *    the definition of wavelet - like transforms for graphs requires a more elaborate construction . for time series the affine wavelets use , in eq . (",
    "1.1 ) , an operator @xmath24 consisting of the product of a translation and a scale transformation which acts on a fixed reference signal ( the mother wavelet @xmath97 ) , namely@xmath98translation in the graph is easily generalized but it is not obvious how to generalize scale transformations . hence we rewrite the wavelet transform in frequency space obtaining@xmath99@xmath100 and @xmath101 denoting the fourier transforms of the mother wavelet and of the signal .",
    "one sees that the wavelet transform is represented as a sum over the fourier spectrum @xmath102 with the argument of the mother wavelet shifted from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "the mapping @xmath105 is a one - to - one onto mapping of @xmath102 in @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the natural generalization of the wavelet transform for graphs may be defined as a similar sum , with the spectrum label shift being one of the possible one - to - one onto mappings of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix ( or of the laplacian matrix ) .",
    "consider the fourier - like transform on graphs and its inverse@xmath106@xmath107 being an eigenvector of @xmath108 or @xmath109 ( or a generalized eigenvector or an eigenvector of @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) and a localized `` mother wavelet''@xmath112then the wavelet - like transform on graphs would be@xmath113@xmath114 is not @xmath115 because in general @xmath116 is not in @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath117 would be a mapping in the set @xmath118 of the possible one - to - one onto mappings of @xmath102 , @xmath119 .",
    "the inverse wavelet transform is@xmath120    hammond , vandergheynst and gribonval @xcite have also attempted to generalize the notion of wavelet transform to graph signals .",
    "however , instead of the sum with the shifted arguments in the spectrum , they simply use a @xmath121dependent weight on the sum with both the signal component @xmath122 and the eigenvector @xmath123 associated to the same spectral value @xmath124 .",
    "therefore their construction is more in the spirit of a superposition of fourier - like transforms than of a wavelet transform .",
    "a more general transform would be@xmath125for comparison with the time series case , this last construction would be similar to the case of the `` conformal wavelets '' generated by @xmath126 .",
    "so far signals on graphs have been described either as vectors on vertex space or as projections of these vectors on the generalized eigenvectors of a particular matrix @xmath80 .",
    "each particular matrix emphasizes a specific topological property of the graph .",
    "tomograms attempt to obtain information about more than one property by projecting on the generalized eigenvectors of a matrix that interpolates between two distinct matrices @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this parallels what for time series is achieved , for example , by the time - frequency tomogram .    when the vertex space has a meaningful physical interpretation it is useful to interpolate between one of the matrices @xmath80 listed before and the matrix for which the vertex signal corresponds to a projection on its eigenvectors .",
    "for a graph with @xmath76 vertices , the vectors on vertex space may be considered as projections on the eigenvectors of a _ _ vertex operator__@xmath129therefore the construction of a tomogram for graph signals would amount to finding an operator that interpolates between @xmath130 and @xmath54 .",
    "a solution could be the family of operators@xmath131with @xmath132 varying between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the tomogram being obtained by the projections of the signal on the eigenvectors of @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath80 is the adjacency matrix @xmath54 , this construction , interpolating between @xmath54 and the vertex operator @xmath136 , is for graphs , the analog of the time - frequency tomogram .",
    "if the ordering of the vertices is arbitrary , the vertex operator has no special meaning and it is more useful to construct tomograms using two of the listed @xmath80 matrices which , by construction , already contain meaningful information on the graph .    as discussed before ,",
    "the reason why time and frequency can not be simultaneously specified is because they correspond to a pair of non - commuting operators .",
    "this is the reason why bilinear transforms , like wigner - ville , are unreliable and it is also the main motivation for using tomogram transforms . in graphs also , the vertex description and the adjacency matrix projection are also incompatible specifications , because in general the @xmath136 and @xmath54 ( or @xmath137 ) matrices do not commute .",
    "it is in this sense , that , as recently stated @xcite , there is an uncertainty principle for graphs , that is , a fundamental trade - off between a signal localization on the graph and on its spectral domain .",
    "the graph tomogram , as defined above , is appropriate for the study of a static network signal .",
    "if during the time evolution the graph structure stays the same , the time series associated to each vertex may simply be projected on the ( generalized ) eigenvectors as in the scalar case .",
    "however if the graph itself changes in time a more general framework must be used .    consider a graph signal that evolves in ( discrete ) time .",
    "the corresponding graph would be , for each time @xmath138 , a regular graph and each one of these graphs is forward - connected to the graph of the subsequent time .",
    "a vertex @xmath139 at time @xmath138 connects to the vertex @xmath140 at time @xmath141 .",
    "this construction accommodates the possible disappearance of vertices . in that case",
    "such vertex @xmath142 would not have any forward edges .",
    "the construction of the @xmath91transforms and the graph tomograms will then proceed as before for the global adjacency matrix . to have a feeling for the kind of eigenvectors obtained for such adjacency matrices , consider a simple case of a finite - vertex circle graph with @xmath76 vertices symmetrically connected to nearest - neighbors and forward connected in periodic time with @xmath143 time steps . then , at each time @xmath138 , the subadjacency matrix @xmath144 is@xmath145let , for definiteness and notational simplicity , @xmath146 .",
    "then the global @xmath147 adjacency matrix is@xmath148this matrix is a tensor product of matrices @xmath149with eigenvalues , respectively@xmath150the eigenvectors of @xmath54 being the tensor products of the eigenvectors of these matrices .",
    "the `` fourier '' transform of a dynamical graph signal will be the projection on these @xmath151dimensional eigenvectors .    for the construction of the tomogram ,",
    "the vertex operator @xmath136 , as in ( [ 5.9 ] ) , is@xmath152where @xmath153 is the @xmath154 matrix @xmath155 .",
    "in this section we present some examples of the use of graph transforms and graph tomograms .",
    "the detailed economic and biological implications of the examples are beyond the scope of this paper . the examples are included only as an illustration of the concepts and also as a guide on how the graph formulation may be a powerful tool to analyze multivariate time series .",
    "an important problem in the design of portfolios or etf s is the classification of the dynamical behavior of the trading values of market products .",
    "identifying clusters of products with similar dynamical behavior allows the design of simpler portfolios , by the selection of representative elements in each cluster .",
    "here we analyze the daily closing equity prices of @xmath156 companies in the sp500 throughout the @xmath157 trading days of 2012 . for the purpose of the calculations",
    "the companies are ordered by sectors .",
    "the company ticker symbols and gics sector codes are listed in the appendix .    from the daily returns@xmath158@xmath159 being the closing price at day @xmath138 , one computes a dynamical distance between the company stocks @xmath160 and @xmath161 by@xmath162the sum being over the @xmath157 trading days in 2012 .",
    "now one computes the smallest non - zero @xmath163 ( @xmath164 )  and an adjacency matrix @xmath108 with matrix elements @xmath165 may be defined either by@xmath166or@xmath167the second form is sometimes the most convenient one because , by varying @xmath168 , one obtains a multiscale analysis of the dynamical similarities of the companies . in figs . 1 and 2 we show the color - coded adjacency matrices @xmath169 and @xmath170 that are obtained .",
    "one sees that the @xmath171adjacency matrix provides a more detailed picture of the nature of correlations between the return behavior of these equities . from inspection of this matrix one",
    "already sees that although the strongest correlations are on the `` utilities '' sector ( gics code 55 ) , many other inter - sectors correlations do exist .",
    "the main purpose of the analysis is precisely to identify sets of companies with similar return behavior .",
    "now consider , as the signal on this graph , the yearly compound return@xmath174 in fig .",
    "3 we compare the compound return @xmath175 of the companies with the absolute value of the projections of @xmath176 on the eigenvectors of the adjacency @xmath108 and the laplacian @xmath177 matrices .",
    "@xmath178 is the mean value of the compound returns , which in this case was @xmath179 .",
    "a standard spectral technique to find clusters in a graph is to look at the lowest non - zero eigenvalues in the spectrum of the laplacian matrix , the corresponding eigenvectors leading ( by k - means ) to a division into clusters that minimizes the ratiocut @xcite              how the companies organize themselves into groups with similar return behavior is better understood by the examination of the @xmath187 tomogram ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the figure is a contour plot of the absolute value of the projections of the compound return ( eq.[6.5 ] ) on the eigenvectors of @xmath188 .",
    "one sees how , starting from the compound return signal at @xmath189 , the contributions of the companies organize themselves into clusters on the way to the final projection on the @xmath190eigenvectors ( at @xmath191 ) .",
    "the selection of clusters may be done by cutting the tomogram at diverse levels and reconstructing the components of the signal .",
    "the tomogram has a rigorous probabilistic interpretation and all the signal information is contained at each @xmath132 level .",
    "therefore the signal components ( dynamical clusters ) are reconstructed by linear combinations of the eigenvectors around each peak with the coefficients taken from the tomogram . as an example fig .",
    "6 shows the cut at @xmath192 and fig .",
    "7 the reconstruction of the signal components around three of its peaks .        one sees how these distinct dynamical clusters have important contributions from different sectors . for example",
    "the last peak ( components 298 to 300 ) is dominated by companies both in the utilities and the energy sector .      in this example , to be studied in more detail elsewhere",
    ", we analyze a biological network for which two types of information are available .",
    "it concerns 12 fish species of the north atlantic for which we have information both on their trophic relations and on their biomass evolution in the period 1976 - 2013 .",
    "these species were selected for the availability of a relatively long biomass time series .",
    "the trophic relations , obtained from averaged stomach sampling are displayed in fig .",
    "8 and in the color - coded adjacency matrix @xmath194 of fig . 9 .",
    "the ordered 12 species are : 1 = cod adult ; 2 = whiting adult ; 3 = haddock adult ; 4 = saithe adult",
    "; 5 = norway pout ; 6 = herring adult ; 7 = sprat ; 8 = sandeels ; 9 = plaice ; 10 = flounder ; 11 = sole ; 12 = lemon sole .        on the other hand ,",
    "considering , for each biomass time series @xmath195 , the population growth rate as the most relevant variable niwa@xmath196we define the @xmath197 delay distance function@xmath198the reason to consider time - delays for the growth rate distances is because in a trophic network the biomass is related to the other species offspring of previous years .    for each distance matrix , with elements @xmath199 , we find the smallest nonzero element ( @xmath200)and define  biomass delayed adjacency matrices as@xmath201fig .",
    "10 displays the color - code one - year delayed biomass adjacency matrix .        a simple inspection of figs . 9 and 10",
    "shows that the trophic and the biomass data do not contain the same information , which is to be expected since the biomass growth rate depends in many other factors besides predation .",
    "this is better seen in fig.11 where we have normalized to one each column in the trophic matrix , and then compared the 28 nonzero elements with the corresponding elements in the @xmath202 matrices ( also normalized to one ) .",
    "although some partial trends might be similar , the general conclusion is that the biomass growth rate evolution seems to depend on many other factors , different from the trophic relations of these 12 species .    in the remaining of this subsection",
    "we will use the one - year delayed biomass growth rate and the tomographic analysis to exhibit the interspecies correlations .",
    "12 shows a contour plot of the tomogram corresponding to the operator @xmath203 .",
    "the signal that is projected on the eigenvectors of this operator is @xmath176 , @xmath175 being the compound growth rate over 36 years@xmath204the breaks that are observed in the contour plot result from the automatic ordering of the eigenvectors by ascending eigenvalue values .",
    "they are of no practical consequence , full information on the signal being kept at all @xmath205levels .",
    "one sees how , for @xmath206 the signal information is compressed in a small number of eigenvectors .      as in the market network example , cutting the tomogram at intermediate @xmath207 levels , clustering dependency of the species is obtained .",
