    "the subject of nucleation remains interesting over many decades @xcite .",
    "physics of nucleation and subsequent growth is certainly challenging and answers to many fundamental questions in this branch are subjects of debate . on the other hand , understanding of these phenomena is crucial to many practical applications @xcite including nanoscience and technology .",
    "when a homogeneous system is quenched ( say , by sudden change of temperature ( @xmath0 ) ) inside the coexistence curve the system phase separates into particle rich and particle poor domains @xcite . while for quenches close to the critical density ( or composition in a binary system ) the phase separation or domain coarsening is spontaneous ( referred to as spinodal decomposition ) , for ones close to the coexistence curve the system may reside in a metastable state in which case",
    "phase separation starts only after nucleation of droplets following rare long wave length fluctuations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "staying outside the so - called spinodal regime , we address the issue of dynamics of fluid droplets and their growth , once they are formed .",
    "results are presented for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations , for a vapor - liquid as well as a liquid - liquid transition .",
    "for the liquid - liquid case , however , because of the computational demand , we will confine ourselves to studies in equilibrium condition .",
    "the primary emphasis in this paper being on the nonequilibrium dynamics @xcite , below we briefly review the subject to place our work in appropriate perspectives .",
    "note here that we expect the discussions provided below to be valid for both liquid - liquid and vapor - liquid transitions , even though some of them were originally meant for liquid - liquid cases or binary mixtures in general .",
    "coarsening of domains in solid binary mixtures is due to diffusive transport and follows the celebrated lifshitz - slyozov ( ls ) law @xcite , where the average length , @xmath1 , of domains grows with time ( @xmath2 ) as @xmath3 .",
    "this scaling law is true irrespective of a quench close to the critical composition or near the coexistence curve . on the other hand , in fluids ,",
    "hydrodynamics plays important role @xcite .",
    "there , for quenches close to the critical density or composition , where one has an interconnected domain structure , one expects three different regimes of growth .",
    "the early time diffusive ls mechanism is followed by a linear viscous @xcite hydrodynamic regime with an exponent @xmath4 and further by an inertial @xcite hydrodynamic regime with an exponent @xmath5 .",
    "it is argued that through the tube - like interconnected domains material flow becomes faster due to hydrodynamics . on the other hand",
    ", one has a disconnected droplet morphology close to the coexistence curve where the domains are expected to grow via collisions @xcite .",
    "there are different possibilities for the mechanism of the above mentioned collision events .",
    "if there exists any inter - droplet force @xcite , the dynamics of droplets is going to be deterministic .",
    "other possibility is that the droplets exhibit brownian motion and collide randomly @xcite .",
    "even though both the cases are discussed in the literature , the dynamics of coarsening of liquid droplets received much less attention as opposed to spinodal decomposition . in this work",
    "our primary focus is on the late stages of droplet growth and understanding the microscopic details of the motion of the droplets .",
    "some preliminary results in this context were published in a recent communication @xcite .    according to binder and stauffer ( bs ) @xcite , if the motion of the droplets is brownian , @xmath1 should grow as @xmath3 . in that case , one can write the equation for the rate of change of droplet density @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the droplet diffusivity and @xmath9 is a constant . using @xmath10 and noting that , according to stokes - einstein - sutherland ( ses ) relation @xcite , @xmath11 is a constant , solution of eq.([bs ] ) gives @xmath12",
    "tanaka proposed that based on the density of droplets , the motion could be deterministic @xcite .",
    "he argued , the bs mechanism will be valid only in the low droplet density limit , for minority species ( in a binary mixture context ) volume fraction @xmath13 .",
    "then the interdroplet distance is much larger than @xmath14 such that the droplet - droplet interaction can be neglected . in such situations",
    "the droplets can freely undergo brownian motion and random collisions . on the other hand , at high droplet density ( with @xmath15 ) , the diffusion field or the concentration gradients around neighbouring droplets get coupled which gives rise to an attractive interaction between the droplets @xcite .",
    "this attractive force eventually induces a direct collision .",
    "this can also be appreciated by considering the excess free energy @xmath16 coming from the concentration ( or density ) gradient , @xmath17 being the concentration .",
    "the excess energy provides a drive for removing the gradient zone , thus causing the attractive interaction between the neighbouring droplets .",
    "note that this gradient term gives rise to the diffusion under concentration gradient in ginzburg - landau formalism @xcite .",
    "this sort of interdroplet interaction will surely accelerate the droplet growth mechanism .",
    "however , for the form of interaction obtained by tanaka , this deterministic motion of droplets provides the exponent for the growth law same as the brownian mechanism but a higher amplitude which , for the sake of brevity , we do not discuss here . the brief discussion below , however , provides idea of how to obtain some knowledge about it from computer simulations .    the ratio of the growth amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the ls and bs mechanisms has been pointed out to be @xcite @xmath20 it has also been argued @xcite that @xmath21 due to some ambiguity in the value of constant @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) . by incorporating appropriate dynamics , in computer simulations ,",
    "it is possible to estimate this ratio .",
    "this , in turn , will provide the realization of actual mechanism , brownian or non - brownian .",
    "we will use this fact plus other means to figure out the presence of inter - droplet interaction .    in this work , in addition to estimating the exponent of the fluid droplet growth , we investigate the true mechanism for the growth .",
    "further , we aim to gain knowledge about the microscopic origin of droplet motion in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium contexts , validity of ses relation for these objects , etc . number of results we have presented here and methodologies used for that purpose are nonconventional in the context of coarsening dynamics .",

    "iv concludes the paper with an outlook for some of the future possibilities .",

    "this sets the lj time unit @xmath40 .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics using this model is studied via the molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite simulations in nvt ensemble using two different thermostats to control the temperature . to probe the hydrodynamic effects we have used the nos - hoover thermostat ( nht ) @xcite . on the otherhand",
    ", an andersen thermostat ( at ) @xcite was used to study the difference between a growth via the droplet diffusion mechanism , studied via nht , and the simple ls mechanism .",
    "we have also used the perfectly hydrodynamics preserving nve ensemble to probe the dynamics of a single droplet in the equilibrium situation .",
    "even though this latter ensemble preserves hydrodynamics perfectly , it can not be used for the nonequilibrium study since it can not keep the temperature constant during the coarsening process .",

    "[ fig6 ] we show @xmath65 in a typical large droplet as a function of time during the period when it does not undergo collision .",
    "the nature of the plot is rather flat , within statistical fluctuations .",
    "notice that the period of time over which this plot is shown , the average number of particles in liquid droplets has significantly increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) due to collision among other droplets .",
    "this confirms that , in this case , the droplets do not grow due to deposition of additional particles onto them via standard diffusion mechanism , as in the ls case .",
    "in such a situation , the only way for the droplets to grow must be the collisions when they move .",
    "one possibility for the droplet motion is that the droplets are very compact objects and all the constituent particles move together .",
    "however , if this picture is true , keeping the conservation of total momentum in the system , motion of droplets will be constrained if we accept the temperature in the liquid and vapor domains to be same .",

    "this essentially means that particles from different directions , possibly all , join the droplet to give ( possibly ) a random directional impact .",
    "often , in the molecular dynamics simulations in canonical ensemble , it is observed that application of thermostats brings in undesired features .",
    "it is , however , understood that a simulation in microcanonical ( nve ) ensemble preserves all the requirements of hydrodynamics . but",

    "so , it will be a good idea to compare the results of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] with the equilibrium nve md runs .",
    "this , in addition to providing a comparative microscopic picture of droplet motion in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations , will be a good test to confirm the validity of nht in the study of hydrodynamic phenomena .    in fig .",

    "a very nice consistency of the curve for the nonequilibrium situation with nht with the other ones speaks about the usefulness of nht in such studies . on the other hand ,",
    "linear looks of the curves on this semi - log plot is informative of an exponential decay of original particles from the droplet .",
    "note that the system size used for the equilibrium cases is smaller than the nonequilibrium case .",
    "this is due to the fact that in equilibrium only one droplet exists and so a smaller system size is a necessity to match the size of the droplet with the nonequilibrium case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) we plot @xmath70 vs @xmath104 , for different droplet sizes from equilibrium configurations in nve ensemble .",
    "it appears that the time scale of decay strongly depends on the size of the droplets .",
    "note that the particles leave a droplet from the boundary or surface region .",
    "considering the fact that the quantity of interest here is a volume fraction and further the length dependence of volume to surface ratio , it is expected that the time scale of decay should be longer for larger droplets .",
    "it appears that there is nice collapse of data from different droplet radii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) ) , when the abscissa is scaled by the droplet surface area .",
    "according to the above argument , however , the time scale should have a linear dependence upon @xmath75 .",
    "but , we could not yet construct an argument for this quadratic nature which appears to be the fact . note that the dynamics is rather complex and one needs further probing to understand this behavior appropriately .",
    "similar results from a binary lennard - jones fluid are also included in fig . [ fig10](a ) and ( b ) . here",
    "the appropriate quantity is the fraction of original a - particles ( the droplets contain a - particles as the majority species ) moving with the droplet .",

    "after the detour on the discussion of compactness of the droplets , we come back to investigate the nature of the droplet motion . in fig . [ fig11](a ) and ( b ) we show a comparison between trajectories of typical droplets in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations from nvt ( nht ) . in both the cases , droplets are of same size and the trajectories are recorded over the same time length . both the trajectories look random . however , it is clearly visible that the droplet in the nonequilibrium case spans larger distance than the equilibrium droplet .",
    "this is an indication of the presence of inter - droplet interaction in the nonequilibrium ( multi - droplet ) situation .",
    "to further strengthen our claim , in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we plot the droplet msd vs @xmath2 for two droplets of same size from equilibrium and nonequilibrium configurations using nht .",
    "while the msd in the equilibrium case shows linear behavior at late time , a characteristic of the brownian diffusive motion , the nonequilibrium case does not show this feature . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "there is only one droplet and so the inter - droplet interaction does not come into the picture , thus the motion is expected to be brownian . also , as already claimed , the msd value for the nonequilibrium situation is higher than the equilibrium case .",
    "all these point to the presence of inter - droplet force .",
    "note that in the nonequilibrium case , it is not possible to obtain msd over an extended period of time because of the finite time available before the droplets collide .",
    "of course , this would be possible in the dilute droplet density limit . but this will require very large system and we do not have possession of enough computational resources that this exercise would demand .",
    "we close the discussion on inter - droplet interaction in nonequilibrium situation by stating that our estimate @xcite for the amplitude ratios for the growths obtained using nht and at gives significantly higher value than the one quoted in eq .",
    "( [ a_ratio ] ) for @xmath115 .",
    "this also suggests the presence of this interaction .",
    "next , to further justify the utility of nht as a hydrodynamics preserving thermostat , we present results for the msd in equilibrium from nht as well as nve , in fig . [ fig13](a ) .",
    "in addition to this justification , these results will provide important physics information as well .",
    "results for different droplet sizes are plotted , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the dashed line here corresponds to the diffusive ( @xmath116 ) behavior .",
    "results from nht are in excellent agreement with nve . here",
    "we should mention that in our md simulations in nht , the temperature was controlled by coupling with the absolute velocities , a standard practice followed .",
    "there are more recent algorithms where , instead of the absolute velocities , one uses the relative velocities that provides galilean invariance @xcite . in future",
    ", it would be interesting to compare our simple nht results with the latter to see what further improvement one can bring in .",
    "next we calculate the droplet diffusivity @xmath8 , in equilibrium condition , for various different system sizes that automatically leads to different droplet sizes . in fig .",
    "[ fig13](b ) we plot @xmath117 vs the droplet diameter @xmath75 . within statistical fluctuation , @xmath117 remains constant .",
    "this validates the ses relation even in such complex droplet diffusion case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig14](a ) we plot the msd of the equilibrium droplets in the binary fluid case for various different system sizes .",
    "all of them show the linear diffusive behavior , characteristic of the brownian motion .",
    "note that unlike the vapor - liquid case , the initial faster @xmath118 regime is absent here .",
    "this can be attributed to the difference in density of the background fluids in the two cases . in the vapor - liquid situation",
    "the low density of the background fluid facilitates the ballistic like faster motion of the droplet at early time leading to the @xmath118 regime , whereas in the binary fluid case the high density background suppresses it . for the same reason , overall msd in the binary fluid is much less even though in both the cases results are presented for same time length . here",
    "also we plot the msd from both nve and nvt ( nht ) ensembles .",
    "the results for nve are again nicely consistent with the nvt results .",
    "exercises in fig .",
    "[ fig13](a ) and [ fig14](a ) once more confirm the validity of nht in studying hydrodynamic phenomena .",
    "[ fig14](b ) we plot @xmath114 vs @xmath75 for equilibrium binary fluid .",
    "the results are again in agreement with the ses relation .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of droplets during the nonequilibrium evolution of a phase separating fluid @xcite , being in the nucleation regime of the phase diagram .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were used where a nos - hoover thermostat controlled the temperature .",
    "the average volume of droplets grows linearly with time .",
    "it is demonstrated that the droplets grow via collisions .",
    "the motion of the droplets is not entirely random because of inter - droplet interaction even for reasonable low droplet density .",
    "this information was obtained from comparative study of the droplet dynamics in nonequilibrium situation and the equilibrium case . in the latter case , very similar results from the nve ensemble molecular dynamics and those from the nvt ensemble with a nos - hoover thermostat confirms the usefulness of this thermostat for the study of hydrodynamic phenomena . in equilibrium ,",
    "the droplets exhibit brownian motion and obey the stokes - einstein - sutherland relation .",
    "results for the equilibrium droplet dynamics are presented for a binary fluid @xcite as well .",
    "it is observed that the particles in a droplet do not move together even though between collisions the droplets keep their size intact . during the course of the motion , some particles leave and approximately a same number of particles join from various directions .",
    "we have found that the fraction of original particles moving with a droplet decays exponentially fast .",
    "in nonequilibrium situation it would be interesting to take a look at the space dependence of temperature",
    ". of particular interest would be to study the temperature profile at the meeting area of two colliding droplets .",
    "it is expected that such collisions would give rise to some temperature increase .",
    "if so , understanding of how that enhanced temperature decays to the system value with time should also be of significant interest .",
    "study with varying overall density will be of utmost importance to understand the dynamics further .",
    "in addition , understanding of decay of autocorrelation functions , probing the aging dynamics @xcite in these systems , will be of general interest .    in this paper ,",
    "the results for the nonequilibrium phenomena are presented only for the vapor - liquid phase separation .",
    "needless to say , a similar study for a binary fluid will be very interesting .",
    "this latter problem will , of course , be computationally extremely demanding because of the overall high particle density throughout the system .",
