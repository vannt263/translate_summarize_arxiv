    "the relation between global flow properties and driving forces is interesting from a fundamental point of view and for upscaling from laboratory experiments to applications .",
    "examples are the change in mean flow through a pipe as a function of pressure drop , the dependence of the heat transport as a function of temperature difference ( rayleigh - benard ( rb ) flow ) , and the increase in torque required to maintain a certain rotation speed in a taylor - couette ( tc ) system . in all three systems",
    "the effects of the boundary layers are of prime importance but the way in which they are dealt with differs . for pipe flow the boundary effects",
    "are usually discussed in terms of the prandtl - van karman theory @xcite which assumes a logarithmic law for the profile .   for the connection between mean flow and pressure",
    "drop it predicts an implicit _ logarithmic _ relationship , the so called skin friction law @xcite , in reasonable agreement with the experimental data .    on the other hand , rayleigh - bnard ( rb )",
    "convection has mainly been discussed in terms of _ algebraic _ relations : in the last decade the power law relation @xmath5 between the nusselt number @xmath6 and the rayleigh number @xmath7 was thought to be an appropriate description of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "recently , it has turned out that the dependences are more involved @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", the analysis by grossmann and lohse @xcite of the different dominant dissipation mechanisms leads to a detailed phase diagram for rayleigh - bnard convection that is in good agreement with the latest @xcite and older experiments .",
    "in this theory the relations between @xmath6 and @xmath7 are again _",
    "algebraic_.    for the taylor - couette system with rotating inner cylinder and resting outer one a description of the relation between the dimensionless torque @xmath8 and the reynolds number @xmath9 both in terms of a skin friction law and a pure power law has been tried @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless torque @xmath10 and the reynolds number @xmath11 are defined with @xmath12 the torque , @xmath13 the fluid density and @xmath14 its kinematic viscosity , @xmath15 the length of the cylinders , @xmath16 the angular rotation rate , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 the radii of the outer and inner cylinder , respectively .",
    "lewis and swinney s analysis @xcite of their experimental data clearly shows that a pure power law @xmath19 with @xmath20 as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite does not describe the data .",
    "a description in terms of the skin friction law is in better agreement with the data .",
    "however , it still is not fully satisfactory , either , as the systematic drifts in their fig .",
    "1 show .",
    "it is our aim here to adopt grossmann and lohse s rayleigh - bnard theory to taylor - couette and pipe flow .",
    "in contrast to the rb case , it is presently not possible to derive the scaling exponents fully from dynamical equations . instead",
    ", there will be one exponent that has to be and can be fitted consistently to data for both systems .",
    "we begin in section 2 with a discussion of the theory and the comparison to lewis and swinney s @xcite experimental data for tc flow . in section 3",
    "we will adopt it to pipe flow for which precise high @xmath9 data on the pressure drop were obtained by smits s group @xcite .",
    "in section 4 we compare the quality of the data fit of this theory with that of the standard skin friction law theory .",

    "the basic idea @xcite behind the analysis of the thermal convection experiments is the splitting of the energy dissipation @xmath21 into contributions from the boundary layer ( bl ) and the bulk , = _ bl + _ bulk .",
    "[ decomp ] for the energy dissipation @xmath22 in tc flow one strictly has @xcite = ^2 g2(b^2 - a^2 ) .",
    "[ exact ] this can be derived as usual by considering the energy balance in a navier - stokes flow . in analogy to ref .",
    "@xcite ( see there for an extensive discussion ) @xmath23 is estimated as _ bulk~u_w^3b - a .",
    "[ epsbulk ] here , @xmath0 is the typical velocity difference between the turbulent and the laminar ( linear ) profile .",
    "it is a measure for the turbulent activity induced by the rotation of the inner cylinder and it defines a reynolds number @xmath24 . in the laminar case @xmath25 , and therefore @xmath26 .",
    "obviously , @xmath0 must not be confused with the velocity @xmath27 of the inner cylinder or the corresponding reynolds number @xmath28 .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath9 ( or @xmath1 ) is _ imposed _ on the flow whereas @xmath29 ( or @xmath0 ) is the _ response _ of the system .",
    "the situation can be compared with rb convection where the rayleigh number is imposed on the cell whereas the response of the system is the large scale wind of turbulence , which again defines a wind reynolds number @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in analogy , also here we call @xmath0 the wind velocity .",
    "it is this wind velocity which leads to the formation of a boundary layer of thickness @xmath30 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume the bl to be of blasius type @xcite , _ u ~(b - a ) /.",
    "[ blasius ] for very small @xmath29 the bl will of course not diverge but saturate at a scale @xmath31 which introduces different scaling relations @xcite , but in the present work we are not interested in this very low reynolds number regime .",
    "with its thickness @xmath30 as the relevant length scale we estimate the energy dissipation in the bl as @xcite _ bl~. [ epsbl ]    putting eqs .",
    "( [ exact ] ) to ( [ epsbl ] ) together one obtains g re = c_1 re_w^5/2 + c_2 re_w^3 , [ main ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two unknown constants .",
    "the first term is the bl contribution , the second one the bulk contribution .",
    "the central question now is : how does @xmath29 depend on @xmath9 ?",

    "the pressure gradient and the energy dissipation @xmath21 per volume are related by = [ basics ] where @xmath40 is the average of the @xmath41-velocity over the cross section of the pipe , which defines the reynolds number @xmath42 . as for the tc flow",
    "we define the wind velocity @xmath0 as the maximal difference between the turbulent mean velocity profile and the laminar ( parabolic ) one .",
    "this maximum will occur close to the walls .",
    "@xmath0 again defines a wind reynolds number @xmath43 .",
    "we split the energy dissipation in a boundary layer part and a bulk part as in equation ( [ decomp ] ) and estimate both contributions as above , eqs .",
    "( [ epsbulk ] ) and ( [ epsbl ] ) , with @xmath44 replaced by @xmath39 , and the thickness of the blasius boundary layer being @xmath45 . with this the equation for the dimensionless pressure drop",
    "@xmath46 becomes p= c_1 re^3/2 + 5/2 + c_2 re^2 + 3 , [ mainprimep ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two unknown constants and @xmath49 the power law exponent of eq .",
    "( [ uc ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ mainprimep ] ) is the analog of equation  ( 8) in the tc case .    in order to test equation ( [ mainprimep ] )",
    "we consider the high precision pressure drop data of smits and zagarola @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear fit then results in @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ pipe]a we show @xmath53 vs @xmath38 . if eq .",
    "( [ mainprimep ] ) holds , a straight line should result which is the case .",
    "again the quality of the fit is demonstrated with the relative errors in fig .",
    "finally we would like to compare our description of the data with the standard skin friction law @xcite . define the friction coefficient @xmath54 for tc flow and @xmath55 for pipe flow .",
    "one then has , in both cases @xcite , = c_1^ lg(re ) + c_2^ [ fric_law ] with two flow dependent constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 which can be connected to the von karman constant @xcite .",
    "employing equation ( [ fric_law ] ) one can indeed fit both data sets reasonably .",
    "we do not show the fits as they have already been shown elsewhere ( see figure 4a of ref .",
    "@xcite for the tc case ) , but we present the relative error @xmath58 in figures [ tc_neu]a and [ pipe]b and compare it with the relative errors of the combined power laws eqs .",
    "( [ mainprime ] ) and ( [ mainprimep ] ) , respectively . for",
    "both tc and pipe flow the relative error of the friciton law is roughly of the same order as that of the fits ( [ mainprime ] ) and ( [ mainprimep ] ) , respectively , maybe somewhat larger .",
    "the preceeding analysis shows that the splitting of the dissipation into a bulk and a boundary layer contribution as used in the rayleigh - bnard theory can also be used to describe the taylor - couette flow @xcite and the pipe flow @xcite data .",
    "however , in contrast to the rb case , only one global balance equation is available , the one for the energy dissipation .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to derive the asymptotic scaling exponents for both the wind reynolds number and the dimensionless torque ( dimensionless pressure drop ) in the tc case ( pipe case ) . instead , one scaling exponent ( @xmath49 ) must be fitted to the data .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 scales similarly in both cases , @xmath60 and @xmath50 for tc and pipe flow , respectively .",
    "the relative error in both cases is less than one percent and within this precession the data indicate really different exponents .",
    "the origin of this difference is unclear .    for shear flow , the strict upper bound for energy dissipation is @xmath61 for @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "all the couette experiments clearly lie below this bound , and even show a trend towards a scaling that is slower than @xmath63 . when assuming the kolmogorov length scale as smallest length scale on which dissipation contributes , nicodemus et al .",
    "@xcite could numerically show that around @xmath64 one has @xmath65 .",
    "kerswell assumes the same cutoff and a certain background flow profile and finds @xmath66 for @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the exponents @xmath67 ( tc ) and @xmath68 ( pipe ) that we find from the experimental data are very close to that value .",
    "however , the scaling @xmath69 with negative @xmath49 implies that the wind does not increase as rapidly as the external velocity with @xmath9 and that according to our definition of @xmath0 the relative difference between the laminar and the mean turbulent velocity profiles vanishes .",
    "given the smallness of @xmath49 the reynolds numbers at which this could become significant are not experimentally accessible .",
    "but the situation remains unsatisfactory and it clearly would be highly desirable to calculate this exponent more rigorously from the navier - stokes equations and to understand the relation to the mean flow profile better .",
