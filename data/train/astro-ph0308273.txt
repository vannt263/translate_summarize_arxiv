    "since their first discovery , the optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have displayed a time evolution which is consistent with the predictions of the fireball model ( & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the power - law decay expected for a spherical outflow has been first observed in grb 970228 ( wijers , rees & 1997 ) .",
    "a tight collimation of the grb outflow ( a narrow jet ) was shown to yield a steepening ( `` break '' ) of the afterglow light - curve fall - off ( rhoads 1999 ) , which subsequently was observed in grb 990123 ( kulkarni 1999 ) . to date",
    ", there are about ten afterglows exhibiting an optical light - curve break and a smaller number of sufficiently well monitored afterglows whose light - curves are pure power - laws . in all cases where the optical spectral slope was determined , it was found to be consistent ( within the fireball / jet model ) with the optical light - curve decay rate .",
    "further tests of the basic afterglow model require observations at earlier times , within the first couple of hours after the burst , and at other wavelengths .",
    "the number of grb afterglows with early observations will be greatly enhanced by the swift satellite . on the latter avenue , the monitoring of about ten @xmath0-ray afterglows has shown that their behavior is consistent with that observed in the optical , without major surprises for the fireball model .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath0-ray observations rarely cover more than one decade in time .",
    "wider time ranges have been reached for about ten radio afterglows , half of them exhibiting a decay which is much slower than in the optical , which is a rather puzzling feature for the fireball model . that radio light - curves fall - off after about 10 days , strongly indicate that peak of the synchrotron spectrum is redward of the radio domain after that time .",
    "then , within the fireball model , one expects nearly equally fast decays in the radio and in the optical , contrary to some observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze in more detail whether the fireball / jet model in its simplest form can explain the discrepancy between the radio and optical decays observed in some afterglows (  [ standard ] ) and to explore departures from the usual assumptions that could accommodate such discrepancies (  [ nonstandard ] ) .",
    "the expression `` simplest fireball model '' will be used to designate an outflow @xmath1 with a uniform angular distribution of the kinetic energy , @xmath2 without energy injection during the afterglow phase ,",
    "@xmath3 interacting with a circumburst medium whose density changes monotonically with radius , @xmath4 with un - evolving and uniform parameters for the electron distribution and magnetic field behind the forward shock . for an easier understanding of the following equations , we list in table 1 the definitions of the quantities which will be encountered more often",
    "for a spherical , uniform fireball , or a wide jet whose dynamics is not yet affected by its lateral spreading , the synchrotron characteristic frequency corresponding to the lowest energy electrons accelerated by the forward shock ( hereafter called `` injection '' frequency ) is given by ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fireball kinetic energy per solid angle , @xmath7 is the observer frame time measured in days , @xmath8 the burst redshift , @xmath9 is the fractional post - shock energy stored in the magnetic field , and @xmath10 parameterizes the lowest energy @xmath11 of the power - law distribution of shock - accelerated electrons , representing the fraction of the energy in the downstream fluid residing in electrons if they all had the same random lorentz factor @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the electron and proton number densities in the post - shock fluid .    the synchrotron characteristic frequency corresponding to an electron energy for which the radiative losses timescale equals the fireball age ( called the `` cooling '' frequency ) is @xmath15 for a homogeneous circumburst medium of particle density @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for an @xmath18 wind - like density profile , @xmath19 being the ratio of the mass loss rate to speed of the wind , in units of @xmath20 . in the above equations , @xmath21 is the compton parameter .",
    "if the afterglow is optically thin at the peak of the spectrum , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency is @xmath22 for a homogeneous external medium , and @xmath23 for a wind . in the derivation of the above equations it was assumed that @xmath24 . for a high magnetic field parameter @xmath9",
    ", the cooling frequency may be below the injection , in which case @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 for a homogeneous external medium , @xmath27 for a wind .",
    "at late times , the injection frequency falls below the absorption frequency . in this case , the latter evolves as @xmath28 ( homogeneous medium ) and @xmath29 ( wind medium ) , where @xmath30 is the exponent of the power - law energy distribution of the electrons accelerated at the forward shock : @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the electron random lorentz factor .",
    "the flux at the peak frequency ( @xmath33 ) of the synchrotron spectrum is @xmath34 for a homogeneous external medium and @xmath35^{-2 }                           \\left ( \\frac{\\e}{10^{53}\\ , { \\rm ergs } } \\right)^{1/2 }                            a _ *                           \\left ( \\frac{\\epsb}{10^{-3 } } \\right)^{1/2 }                            \\ ; t_d^{-1/2 } \\ ; { \\rm mjy } \\ ; , \\label{fp2}\\ ] ] for a wind - type medium , where @xmath36 is the luminosity distance .    for a spreading jet ,",
    "the time - dependence of the spectral breaks is given by @xmath37 while the synchrotron peak flux evolution is @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 , the self - absorption frequency evolution is @xmath40 .    to assess which radio afterglows exhibit a decay consistent with that seen at optical frequencies , we list in table 2 the expected radio light - curves for spherical and collimated outflows , a homogeneous or wind - like medium , and for the only three likely orderings of the break frequencies a few days after the burst . these light - curve indices were derived from the shape of the synchrotron spectrum ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) and the evolution of the break frequencies and peak flux .",
    "most of the cases shown in table 2 for @xmath41 have been presented in other works ( , rees & wijers 1998 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .      as shown in table 2 , the self - absorbed , low frequency emission rises in time in most cases , as the optical thickness of the swept - up medium decreases , while the afterglow light - curve at higher frequencies , above both @xmath25 and @xmath42 , falls - off . for observing frequencies higher than both @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the light - curve is @xmath44 for a fireball ( either type of medium ) and @xmath45 for a spreading jet .",
    "such behaviors are observed in the radio , optical , and x - ray light - curves of grb afterglows , as illustrated in figure 1 , displaying all afterglows with a good time coverage in the radio . a flat radio light - curve or a rise slower than @xmath46 can be noticed for most afterglows until 2030 days ( 70 days for 970508 ) , indicating that @xmath25 is never well above the radio domain , as in this case the radio emission should exhibit a sharper rise .",
    "the late time radio emissions of afterglows 970508 , 000418 , and 021004 exhibit the same decay as in the optical , as expected when both domains lie above the injection frequency and the source is optically thin in the radio , thus these afterglows are readily consistent with the expectations for the simplest fireball model .",
    "however , for all other afterglows , the radio emission falls - off significantly slower than in the optical .    if the cooling frequency @xmath43 lies above radio ( @xmath47 ) but below optical ( @xmath48 ) , then the difference between the decay slopes of the optical ( @xmath49 ) and radio ( @xmath50 ) light - curves is @xmath51 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath52 for a wind , the former value being close to that observed in 980703",
    ". decreases slower for a homogeneous medium and increases faster for a wind than given in equations ( [ nuc0 ] ) and ( [ nuc2 ] ) ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) , which mitigates the fall - off of the optical light - curve and yields a smaller @xmath53 , thus this case does not accommodate the observations better ] .",
    "this possibility can be tested by noting that @xmath54 implies that the optical and x - ray decays have the same slopes .",
    "the upper limit at 5 days on the x - ray emission of 980703 indicates an x - ray slope larger than @xmath55 ( figure 1 ) , thus it may be consistent with the optical slope @xmath56 .",
    "index differences larger than @xmath57 , such as those seen in the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , 000301 , 000926 , and 010222 , require the presence of a stronger spectral break between radio and optical . however , to obtain a falling - off radio light - curve , the source must be optically thin at radio frequencies ( table 2 ) , therefore that spectral break may only be @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath58 cases that yield a decaying radio emission are : @xmath1 a spreading jet with @xmath58 and @xmath54 , @xmath2 a fireball interacting with a wind and @xmath59 , @xmath3 a spreading jet with @xmath60 .",
    "below , we analyze each case in more detail .      in this case",
    "the radio decay slope is @xmath62 , similar to that exhibited by the afterglow 991208 and 000301 .",
    "prior to the time @xmath63 when the jet edge becomes visible ( the jet lateral spreading also becomes important at this time if the jet has sharp edges ) , @xmath42 is given by equation ( [ nui ] ) , while for @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "therefore @xmath66 implying that , for @xmath67 day ( as observed ) , the electron and magnetic field parameters must be close to equipartition , @xmath68 , to maintain @xmath69 ghz until the last radio measurement . because @xmath43 is constant for a spreading jet , the condition @xmath70 is equivalent with @xmath71 . using equations ( [ nuc0 ] ) and ( [ nuc2 ] ) with @xmath72 ( implied by @xmath73 ) , it leads to @xmath74 for a homogeneous medium or @xmath75 for a wind .",
    "then , equations ( [ nua0r ] ) and ( [ nua2r ] ) give @xmath76 hz . at @xmath64 , @xmath77 , therefore @xmath78 ghz , the source is optically thick at 8 ghz at all observing times .",
    "thus the conditions @xmath79 and @xmath54 for @xmath80 days are incompatible .    furthermore , the condition @xmath81 and equation ( [ nui100 ] ) imply that @xmath82 ghz .",
    "first , assume that @xmath83 ghz .",
    "then the radio flux @xmath84 at @xmath63 is the synchrotron peak flux given in equations ( [ fp0 ] ) and ( [ fp2 ] ) .",
    "the above values of @xmath9 , @xmath16 , and @xmath19 yield @xmath85 jy , decaying as @xmath86 at @xmath64 to @xmath87 mjy . for @xmath88 ghz",
    ", self - absorption reduces the 8 ghz flux to a few mjy , well above the 0.1 mjy radio flux observed at 100 days .",
    "the inconsistency between the expected and observed radio fluxes is not alleviated if @xmath89 ghz ( as assumed above ) because this requires a higher @xmath6 or a denser external medium ( @xmath9 is already maximal ) , which , due to that @xmath90 at @xmath91 , can only increase the radio flux .",
    "thus we reach the conclusion that a spreading jet with @xmath61 and @xmath54 can not accommodate the radio and optical decays seen in 991208 and 000301 .",
    "we note that , if the optical emission seen in 991208 after 10 days is not from the afterglow but to a supernova contribution ( castro - tirado 2001 ) , then the radio and optical fall - offs are not measured simultaneously , leaving the possibility of a mildly relativistic jet during the radio decay , which yields at @xmath92 a decay slower than the @xmath45 expected for very relativistic jets .",
    "however , @xmath93 would be required in this case , which is clearly inconsistent with the steep @xmath94 optical decay of 991208 observed until 10 days .      in this case",
    "@xmath96 , consistent with the radio decay seen for 991216 and 000926 until 100 days .",
    "although the decrease of @xmath42 for a fireball ( @xmath97 ) is slower than for a spreading jet ( @xmath98 ) , electron and magnetic field parameters close to equipartition are still required in this case to ensure that @xmath54 until 100 days .",
    "the reason is that , for a fireball interacting with a wind , @xmath43 increases as @xmath99 , thus the @xmath100 ratio decreases equally fast for either a fireball in a wind or for a spreading jet .",
    "consequently , this model requires the same dense winds , with @xmath75 , leading to @xmath101 ghz ( ) , a source that is not optically thin at 8 ghz , and to @xmath102 jy ( ) , well above the observed radio fluxes .",
    "thus the fireball model for the radio decay of 991216 and 000926 encounters the same problems as the jet model for 991208 and 000301 .",
    "the radio decay slope expected for this case , @xmath104 , is close to that observed in 010222 at 5100 days . as for the first model above ,",
    "the condition @xmath105 ghz for a spreading jet with @xmath106 day requires that @xmath10 and @xmath9 are close to equipartition ( ) .",
    "the other two conditions involved in this hypothesis ",
    "@xmath107 ghz and @xmath108  set upper bounds on the external density @xmath16 and wind parameter @xmath19 . from equations ( [ nuc0])([nua2a ] ) we find the former condition being more restrictive , leading to @xmath109 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath110 for a wind .",
    "lower bounds on the same parameters are set by that the peak flux at 100 days should exceed that observed at 8 ghz for 010222 ( 0.03 mjy ) . from equations ( [ fp0 ] ) , ( [ fp2 ] ) , and the @xmath38 expected for a spreading jet , we find that @xmath111 for a homogeneous medium or @xmath112 for a wind . given that @xmath113 ghz , @xmath16 and @xmath19 should be close to these lower limits , implying thus a very tenuous external medium .    substituting these lower limits in equations ( [ nuc0 ] ) and ( [ nuc2 ] )",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath114 hz for either type of medium , the cooling frequency is between the optical and x - ray domains . as the cooling frequency is constant for a spreading jet , the optical and x - ray decay slopes are expected to be equal . this is consistent with the observations of 010222 at 0.43 days ( figure 1 ) .    thus the radio , optical , and x - ray decay slopes of 010222 may be accommodated by a spreading jet with @xmath115 .",
    "we note that numerical calculations of light - curves from spreading jets show that , when the dynamics is accurately calculated and the analytical approximation of constant jet radius ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) is relaxed , the jet light - curve at @xmath116 is flat instead of decaying as @xmath117 , thus it may be that , in fact , the radio fall - off of 010222 is not consistent with a spreading jet .",
    "as argued in the previous section , the radio and optical decay observed for the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , 000301 , 000926 , and 010222 appear incompatible with the simplest fireball model .",
    "for these afterglows , at least one of the assumptions usually made in the calculation of analytical light - curves must be relaxed . in scenarios where the radio an optical emissions arise from the same population of electrons ,",
    "the ratio of the afterglow emission at these frequencies depends on the slope of the afterglow spectrum and on the evolution of all spectral break frequencies located between the radio and optical domain . in scenarios where the radio and optical emissions arise in different regions of the grb outflow",
    ", the segregation may be either angular or radial , in the directions perpendicular and parallel , respectively , to that of the outflow motion .",
    "thus , we consider four ways in which the difference @xmath118 between the radio and optical decay indices may depart from expectations :    1 .   radio and optical arise from the same electron population",
    "there is no spectral break between the radio and the optical domains .",
    "then the variation in time of the slope of the synchrotron spectrum , which is determined by that of the electron distribution @xmath119 , 2 .",
    "there is a break between radio and optical , whose evolution is different than that expected in the simplest afterglow model (  [ standard ] ) , 2 .",
    "radio and optical arise from different electron populations",
    ". 1 .   the anisotropic distribution of the energy per solid angle @xmath6 across the outflow structure , so that the radio and optical emissions arise from different parts of the outflow , moving at different lorentz factors ( for the same photon - arrival time ) , 2 .",
    "the existence of a long - lived flow of slower ejecta which are energized by the reverse shock and dominate the radio afterglow emission , while the optical afterglow arises in the forward shock propagating into the circumburst medium .",
    "we analyze below these possibilities for the five afterglows ( 991208 , 991216 , 000301 , 000926 , and 010222 ) for which the radio and optical decay indices are incompatible with each other in the simplest fireball model .",
    "we also discuss the effect of non - relativistic motion on the decoupling of the radio and optical light - curve decays .      in a scenario employing an evolving @xmath30 ,",
    "the steepening of the optical light - curve decay observed in the afterglows 991216 , 000301 , 000926 , and 010222 could arise from a non - monotonic evolution of @xmath30 and not necessarily from a collimated outflow .",
    "we consider first a spherical outflow and discuss later the case of a jet .    if the onset of the radio fall - off at @xmath120 days is identified with the passage of @xmath42 ( which is the most natural explanation ) then , for a spherical outflow , @xmath121 , independent of the type of external medium . for a power - law density profile of the circumburst medium , @xmath122 the evolutions of the peak flux @xmath123 and cooling frequency",
    "are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively . substituting in the afterglow flux at @xmath126 : @xmath127 they lead to a light - curve decay index at frequency @xmath128 given by @xmath129 where the additional last term in the @xmath130 applies only for @xmath131 .",
    "evidently , an evolving index @xmath30 can yield a pure power - law afterglow light - curve in only one observational domain .",
    "given that optical measurements cover the widest time range and usually have the smallest uncertainties , we determine the evolution of @xmath30 by requiring that the optical light - curve is a power - law , as observed , that the optical decay index given in equation ( [ alfa ] ) does not vary in time . equation ( [ alfa ] ) can be recast as @xmath132 is the electron index that would be required by the observed @xmath133 if @xmath30 were constant . integrating the above equation yields @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the value of @xmath30 at some time @xmath136 when the optical slope @xmath137 was measured : @xmath138 if @xmath139 and @xmath140 if @xmath141 .",
    "there are a few consequences stemming from equations ( [ alfa ] ) , ( [ dpdt ] ) , and ( [ pt ] ) . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the index @xmath30 increases in time , while for @xmath143 it decreases , in either case approaching asymptotically the value @xmath144 .",
    "the light - curve index at an arbitrary frequency @xmath128 satisfies @xmath145 where the sign of the last term in the @xmath130 is `` + '' for @xmath146 , and ``  '' for @xmath147 , otherwise that term is absent . substituting equations ( [ dpdt ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) in ( [ alpha ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath148 therefore , a radio decay significantly shallower than in the optical ( @xmath149 ) requires that @xmath142 , implying an increasing @xmath30 and an optical spectrum that softens in time ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath142 , equation ( [ alfanu ] ) gives that the afterglow decay in the @xmath0-ray should be steeper than in the optical ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "also for @xmath142 , the evolution of @xmath152 , @xmath153 , shows that the radio decay should steepen in time ( @xmath154 ) , while the @xmath0-ray decay should flatten ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the above consequences of requiring that @xmath156 can be used to test the scenario of an evolving index @xmath30 . using the light - curve characteristics given in table 3",
    ", we find that a radio decay consistent with the observations is obtained only if @xmath157 and @xmath141 , for the grb afterglows    1 .   991208 , for which equation ( [ alfanu ] ) yields @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "the available measurements of the optical spectral slope , @xmath160 ( castro - tirado 2001 ) , @xmath161 ( djorgovski 1999 ) , and @xmath162 ( bloom 1998 ) , indicate a hardening of the optical emission that rules out the current scenario , in which it is expected that @xmath163 2 .   \\991216 . for the @xmath137 given in table 3 for galactic extinction of @xmath164 ,",
    "the radio decay index is @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "however , the expected @xmath0-ray decay has an index @xmath168 and @xmath169 , which is too large compared too observations .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath170 3 .   000301 , for which @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the optical slopes ( corrected only for galactic extinction ) determined by rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) ",
    "@xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177  indicate a general softening with @xmath178 from day 5 to day 13 ( after the optical light - curve break )",
    ". the expected softening , @xmath179 , is consistent with the observations .    the evolution of @xmath30 required to yield the power - law decay of the optical emission of the afterglows 000926 and 010222 leads to radio fall - offs that are too steep in comparison with the observations .",
    "therefore , the scenario considered here is consistent with the available data in only one case ( 000301 ) .",
    "we note that , a collimated outflows leads to a smaller @xmath144 , as the effect of collimation is to yield steeper light - curve decays , and thus to larger radio decay indices ( ) .",
    "consequently , a jet ( spreading laterally or not ) , is even less able than a spherical outflow in explaining the shallow decay observed for the five anomalous afterglows .      below the absorption frequency @xmath25 ,",
    "the afterglow light - curve should should rise or be flat , unless @xmath25 increased sufficiently fast .",
    "such a behavior is not observed , thus the falling - off radio emission rules out that spectral break located between radio and optical domains and having a non - standard evolution is @xmath25 . if the break were the injection frequency @xmath42 then , to satisfy the condition @xmath180 until the last radio measurement requires large values for the @xmath9 parameter . as shown in  [ jet1 ] and  [ fballwind ] , in those cases where the shallow radio decay also requires that @xmath54 , the resulting synchrotron peak flux is too large compared to the observed radio flux at about 100 days . as shown in table 2 , the steepest radio fall - off that can be obtained for @xmath181 , is @xmath117 for a spreading jet .",
    "thus , in the simplest model , the case @xmath180 can not explain the steep radio decays observed for the above five anomalous afterglows , ranging from @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "the remaining break to be considered is the cooling frequency @xmath43 .",
    "its location below the optical domain implies that the optical and @xmath0-ray light - curves must have the same decay , which is satisfied by the afterglow 000926 , but is rather inconsistent with 991216 and 010222 , for which @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath0-ray emission of these two afterglows has a significant contribution from inverse compton scatterings , which could yield a steeper fall - off that at optical frequencies . for 991208 and 000301",
    ", there are no @xmath0-ray observations to test that @xmath186 .",
    "the non - standard evolution of @xmath43 can be determined from the difference @xmath53 between the observed radio and optical decay indices .",
    "given that the slope @xmath187 of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath188 , steepens by @xmath189 from @xmath190 to @xmath191 , it follows that @xmath192 , thus @xmath193 .",
    "the decay indices shown in figure 1 lead to @xmath194 for 991208 , @xmath195 for 991216 , @xmath196 for 000301 , @xmath197 for 000926 , and @xmath198 for 010222 .",
    "such steep fall - offs of @xmath43 exceed by much that allowed in the simplest fireball model , where @xmath199 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath200 for a wind - like medium ( and [ [ nuc2 ] ] ) . for a power - law density profile ( ) and a spherical outflow , the cooling frequency evolution is @xmath201 .",
    "thus , for @xmath16 increasing as a small power of the radius ( @xmath202 ) , @xmath43 decreases roughly inversely proportional with @xmath203 .",
    "the fastest fall - off of @xmath43 with time is reached for @xmath204 , corresponding to a sharp increase in the external density , when @xmath205 , which is slightly slower than that required by the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , and 010222 , and substantially slower than necessary for 000301 and 000926 .",
    "for this reason , we consider the case where there is a contribution to the evolution of @xmath43 arising from a time variation of the other afterglow parameters that determine it : @xmath9 and @xmath6 ( and [ [ nuc2 ] ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field parameter @xmath9 could vary in time if its value is determined by the lorentz factor of the fireball , if the shocked external medium mixes with the grb ejecta having a frozen - in magnetic field , or if the circumburst medium is magnetized",
    ". the fireball energy @xmath6 may decrease in time due to radiative losses or may increase if the shock is refreshed through a delayed energy injection caused by a spread in the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta ( rees & 1998 ) .",
    "given that we want to explain both the observed radio and optical decay indices , @xmath206 and @xmath133 , and that these indices depend on the electron parameter @xmath10 , we also allow this parameter to be variable .",
    "we note that radiative losses couple the variation of @xmath6 to those of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , to calculate this dependence , a knowledge of the entire electron distribution is necessary . for @xmath207",
    ", it can be assumed that the distribution extends up to arbitrarily high energies , thus its slope and minimal electron energy ( parameterized by @xmath10 ) suffice , however a high energy cut - off must exist for @xmath208 ( as is the case for 991216 , 000301 and 010222 , if @xmath141 ) .",
    "for this reason , we allow the evolution of @xmath6 to be independent of that of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    the evolution of the afterglow parameters @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 can be constrained with the aid of the observed light - curve decay indices @xmath206 and @xmath133 .",

    "so far , we have considered two scenarios where the radio and optical afterglows arise from the same population of electrons .",
    "if there is no break in the synchrotron spectrum between the radio and optical domains and if the slope of the electron energy distribution does not change in time , then the discrepancy between the radio and optical decays of the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , 000301 , and 000926 must be explained by that these emissions arise from different regions of the grb outflow . the key quantity in the calculation of the afterglow emission is the outflow lorentz factor , which is determined by the energy per solid angle and the degree of collimation of each region .",
    "thus , one can imagine that , in a structured outflow , a part of it has a higher kinetic energy and a larger lorentz factor than another part , so that the former radiates more in the optical and less in the radio than the latter",
    ".    within the structured outflow scenario , an optical decay steeper than in the radio can be obtained if the outflow radiating in the optical is tightly collimated .",
    "then , for an adiabatic fireball and without energy injection , the optical decay index increases by @xmath278 for @xmath157 and by @xmath279 for @xmath240 at the time @xmath63 when the boundary of the optically emitting outflow becomes visible ( ) . as discussed in  [ coll ] , the @xmath285 expected for a structured outflow is consistent with that observed for the afterglows 991216 , 000926 , and 010222 , but not for 000301 .",
    "furthermore , the near - infrared  optical spectral slope determined for the afterglow 000301 by jensen etal ( 2001 ) , @xmath302 , even the steepest post - break decay index that can be obtained with a structured outflow , @xmath303 , is too shallow compared with that observed . for these reasons ,",
    "this afterglow will not be considered in this section .    if the radio emitting outflow is quasi - spherical , then the differential decay @xmath304 is equal to @xmath285 if the cooling frequency of the jet emission is blueward of the optical and to @xmath305 ( @xmath157 ) or @xmath306 ( @xmath240 ) if it is below . for the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , and 010222 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 , respectively , thus the differential decay seen between the radio and optical emission of the first three afterglows",
    "may be accommodated by an optical jet interacting with a homogeneous medium , particularly if the cooling frequency is redward of the optical domain .",
    "however , the @xmath310 of the afterglow 000926 exceeds that allowed in this scenario , thus allowance for a different electron index @xmath30 of the radio and optical outflows must be made .",

    "having outlined the general set - up for a scenario that accounts for the observed radio and optical decays ( for four of the five anomalous afterglows )  a structured outflow containing a core with a higher energy per solid angle , producing the optical afterglow , and yielding a light - curve break when its edge becomes visible , and an envelope of lower energy per solid angle , from where the radio afterglow arises  we proceed to constrain this scenario by requiring that the optical and radio outflows dominate the emission in their respective domain over the entire time interval when the afterglow decay is observed .",
    "these constraints are suggested by that , as it softens , the synchrotron emission from the optical core yields a radio contribution that falls - off shallower than that from the radio envelope , while the slower deceleration of the radio envelope yields an optical emission that decays slower than that from the optical core .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider that the angular distribution of the ejecta energy is uniform in both the core and the envelope of the relativistic outflow , the fireball angular structure is a top - hat function ( co - axial uniform outflows ) .",
    "such a `` dual fireball '' scenario ( frail 2000 ) yields the maximal decoupling of the radio and optical emissions .",
    "that the optical light - curve decays from the earliest observation indicates that the line observer  fireball center is within the optical jet . in this case , the radio envelope , being less relativistic than the optical core , becomes visible to the observer before the edge of the core , thus the radio light - curve break seen in the afterglows 991208 and 000926 at @xmath312 days , well after the time of the optical break , can not be due to the outflow structure and relativistic effects . given that for plausible afterglow microphysical parameters the injection frequency @xmath42 is expected to cross the radio domain at around 10 days ( ) , it is more natural to associate the radio light - curve breaks of 991208 and 000926 ( and of all other radio afterglows in figure 1 ) with the passage of @xmath42 through the radio band .    assuming that the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 are the same everywhere , the larger energy per solid angle within the core implies that its injection frequency @xmath313 is higher than for the envelope , therefore @xmath313 crosses the radio domain at a time @xmath314 . for @xmath315 , the radio emission from the optical jet",

    "the additional constraint on @xmath411 necessary to calculate the upper limit on @xmath386 is provided by requiring that the optical emission from the radio envelope does not overshine that from the optical jet at any time when the power - law fall - off of the optical afterglow is observed , otherwise a flattening of the optical light - curve is expected .",
    "this constraint is satisfied at all times if it is fulfilled at the time @xmath412 of the latest optical measurement .",
    "similar to the above calculation of the radio emission from the optical core and the radio envelope , the condition @xmath413 leads to an upper limit on the cooling frequency @xmath414 for the radio envelope emission . from @xmath415 and @xmath416 for a homogeneous medium , it follows that , for this type of external medium , @xmath414 is also an upper limit on @xmath417 , the cooling frequency for the optical core emission , which can be easily converted into an upper limit on @xmath411 .    in the @xmath344 case ,",
    "the analytical calculation of @xmath386 is cumbersome and it is best to convert all constraints on the afterglow spectral properties into constraints on the afterglow model parameters .",
    "the five parameters @xmath390 , @xmath391 , @xmath16 ( or @xmath19 for @xmath240 ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 for a structured outflow are constrained by three equations ( for @xmath418 , @xmath326 , and @xmath331 ) and two inequalities ( for @xmath414 and @xmath341 ) . solving for the allowed parameter ranges in all cases above where @xmath419 ghz , we find that @xmath420 ergs , @xmath421 , and @xmath422 ( for 991208 ) , @xmath423 ( for 991216 ) , @xmath424 ( for 000926 ) , and @xmath425 ( for 010222 ) . such large external densities , characteristic for a red supergiant or a molecular cloud , lead to a semi - relativistic motion ( @xmath426 ) and a self - absorbed radio emission at @xmath427 . more worrisome ,",
    "the electron parameter @xmath10 , together with the electron distribution slope @xmath428 required by the observed radio decay index @xmath206 , imply total electron energies that exceed equipartition with protons .",
    "thus , the marginally viable cases require implausible afterglow parameters .",
    "in this section we consider the possibility that the slowly decaying radio emission observed in some grb afterglows arises in a long - lived reverse shock crossing some incoming , delayed ejecta , while the optical emission is produced in the forward shock which energizes the circumburst medium .",
    "an injection of ejecta in the fireball , lasting for the entire duration of the radio observations ( tens to hundreds of days ) , is unlikely to be due to a very long - lived central engine .",
    "instead we consider that the delayed injection is caused by that the ejecta are expelled by the grb progenitor with a broad range of initial lorentz factors ( rees & 1998 ) , the slower ejecta lagging behind the faster part of the outflow and catching - up with it during the afterglow phase , as the leading edge of the fireball is decelerated by the circumburst medium .    assuming constant parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , the steepening of the optical light - curve decay must be associated with a tight collimation of the ejecta because a sudden reduction of the injected power can not explain the steepness of the decay after the break time @xmath63 . for a jet with sharp edges , the slower moving , leading edge of the outflow spreads laterally at @xmath64 faster than the incoming ejecta , which leads to angular non - uniformities in the lorentz factor of the fireball . to avoid this complication ,",
    "we assume that the jet does not have sharp edges , it is embedded in an envelope ( as considered in  [ structure ] ) which prevents its lateral spreading , but yielding a negligible contribution to the afterglow emission .",
    "the decay of the radio emission from the reverse shock is determined by the evolution of @xmath429 and of the peak flux @xmath430 , which depend on the distribution of energy with lorentz factor in the ejecta and on the lorentz factor @xmath431 of the ejecta which catch - up with the leading edge of the fireball at some observer time @xmath203 . for the dynamics of the latter , we consider the simple law @xmath432 for the fireball energy .",
    "most likely , the ejecta are expelled over a timescale much shorter than the observer time ( @xmath433 day ) when the afterglow observations are made .",
    "because of this , the lorentz factor @xmath434 of the freely expanding ejecta which enter the afterglow fireball at @xmath435 days is independent on the duration of the ejecta release . from the kinematics of the ejecta  fireball catch - up",
    ", one obtains that @xmath436 where @xmath437 is the lorentz factor of the decelerating fireball ( ) . since the fireball lorentz factor at 100 days is less than a few , the above equation shows that , in order for the reverse shock to last for @xmath438 days , the grb progenitor must release ejecta whose initial lorentz factor is @xmath439 .",
    "we note that the above ratio of lorentz factors is time - independent .",
    "because the lorentz factor of the reverse shock in the comoving frame of the unshocked ejecta depends on this ratio , it follows that the reverse shock lorentz factor and the typical electron energy behind the reverse shock do not evolve in time .",
    "then , if the magnetic parameter @xmath9 is also the same ( which implies that the magnetic field is identical ) , the reverse shock injection frequency evolves as @xmath440 , where @xmath441 is the injection frequency behind the forward shock .",
    "the equality of @xmath9 behind both shocks also implies that the ratio of the reverse to forward shock peak fluxes is just the ratio of the corresponding number of emitting electrons , @xmath442 , where @xmath443 and @xmath289 are the ejecta mass and that of the swept - up circumburst medium , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the mass of the ejecta energized by the reverse shock increases as a power - law in the lorentz factor of the incoming ejecta : @xmath444 therefore @xmath445 ( see ) .",
    "equation ( [ mi ] ) is equivalent to the assumption that the energy distribution in the ejecta is @xmath446 .",
    "using equations ( [ nuic ] ) and ( [ fpjet ] ) with @xmath432 , the evolution of the reverse shock injection frequency and peak flux are @xmath447 from here it can be shown that the radio flux from the reverse shock , @xmath448 , evolves as @xmath449 with @xmath450 where @xmath30 is the electron index for the reverse shock , which we assume to be the same as for the forward shock .",
    "the exponent @xmath219 which quantifies the amount of injected energy can be estimated from the observed optical light - curve decay index @xmath347 . from equations ( [ nuic ] ) , ( [ spek ] ) , and ( [ fpjet ] )",

    "given that the radio shallow decays are observed to last for 12 decades in time , the constraint given in equation ( [ eq ] ) should be used only for @xmath459 , corresponding to at least a two - fold increase of the fireball energy .",
    "the second constraint is that the light - curve steepening @xmath460 given in equation ( [ dalpha ] ) , resulting from seeing the core edge , must be larger than that observed in the optical , @xmath461 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the reason is that , if measurements did not capture the asymptotic early - time optical light - curve index , then the @xmath461 determined through power - law fits to the pre- and post - break emission is an underestimation of the true index increase @xmath462 .",

    "for the cases outlined above , involving a homogeneous medium , we find the following constraints on the afterglow parameters    1 .",

    "compared to the afterglow parameters found by us ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) through fitting the radio , optical and @xmath0-ray light - curves of these afterglows with the forward shock model ( without any contribution from the reverse shock ) , the above kinetic energies per solid angle for the reverse  forward shock model are slightly lower , the magnetic field parameter is somewhat larger , while the circumburst densities and electron energy parameter are similar .",
    "the largest discrepancy occurs for the afterglow 010222 , for which radio data were not available at the time when our afterglow fits were done .    for a wind - like medium ,",
    "the required kinetic energies are below @xmath528 ergs / sr , the microphysical parameters are slightly larger , and the wind density corresponds to @xmath529 .",

    "the scenarios considered so far involved relativistic fireballs . for either a spherical outflow or a jet with sharp edges ,",
    "the afterglow light - curves asymptotically reach the same decay as the outflow becomes non - relativistic because the lateral spreading of the jet diminishes and the entire emitting surface is visible in both cases . as shown by vietri & waxman ( 2000 ) , for a jet , the transition to the non - relativistic regime mitigates the light - curve decay , while for a fireball it leads to a steeper decay .",
    "this may suggest that a slow radio decay following a fast optical fall - off may be explained by a jet becoming non - relativistic ( frail 2004 ) .    in the above scenario ,",
    "the optical light - curve is @xmath532 ( relativistic jet ) . from the basic equations for dynamics and evolution of spectral parameters , the radio flux from a non - relativistic fireball",
    "is found to be @xmath533 for the electron distribution index implied by the optical light - curve index @xmath133 ( table 2 ) , the resulting radio decay is significantly steeper than observed for the afterglows 000301 and 000926 , for either type of medium .",
    "for the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , and 010222 , a homogeneous medium leads to radio decays shallower than observed , while a wind medium yields radio fall - offs that are too steep .",
    "since the non - relativistic transition flattens the decay of the emission from a jet , it can be argued that a semi - relativistic motion leads to a milder flattening than expected for the non - relativistic regime , becoming thus compatible with the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , and 010222 , for which the expected asymptotic radio decay is too shallow in the case of a homogeneous medium .",
    "a severe problem with the scenario of a relativistic optical and semi - relativistic radio afterglow is that it requires the shallow radio decay to be seen after the steeper optical fall - off .",
    "therefore this scenario can not be at work in the afterglows 991216 and 010222 , whose radio and optical observations overlap in time over one and almost two decades , respectively . for the afterglows 991208 , 000301 , and 000926 ,",
    "the overlap is short - lived , still it is rather unlikely that , during the short time interval from the last optical measurements and untill the onset of the radio decay , a relativistic jet decelerating as @xmath300 can slow down to a semi - relativistic motion .",
    "we note that a scenario where the fireball becomes non - relativistic before the onset of the optical fall - off can not explain the observed index difference @xmath53 . above the cooling frequency ,",
    "the light - curve for a non - relativistic afterglow is @xmath534 using equation ( [ fnr ] ) , it follows that , when the cooling frequency is between the radio and optical domains , @xmath535 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath536 for a wind , neither of which is compatible with the observations of the five anomalous afterglows .",
    "as the non - relativistic motion of a uniform grb remnant seems unable to accommodate the five anomalous afterglows , we turn our attention to a structured outflow .",
    "we consider again the dual outflow scenario , which allows a maximal decoupling of the radio emission , arising from the non - relativistic , uniform outflow envelope , from the optical emission produced by a relativistic , uniform core .",
    "equation ( [ gamma ] ) shows that , for the envelope to become non - relativistic at @xmath537 days after the burst , the external density must be @xmath538 or the grb progenitor must have a wind with @xmath539 ( much larger than for any known type of massive star ) , where @xmath540 is the kinetic energy per solid angle in the radio envelope .    substituting in equations ( [ nui ] ) , ( [ nua0a ] ) , and ( [ nua2a ] ) , such high densities lead to an optically thick afterglow at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum at @xmath541 , therefore the self - absorption frequency is given by @xmath542 , instead of equations ( [ nua0a])([nua2a ] ) , where @xmath543 is the optical thickness to self - absorption at the injection frequency , @xmath544 being the electron column density of the swept - up circumburst medium , and @xmath219 the electron charge . for @xmath545 and a homogeneous medium with the high density required by the early onset of the non - relativistic regime ,",
    "the resulting self - absorption frequency is @xmath546    if the radio domain were self - absorbed at @xmath547 , the radio emission would rise as @xmath548 ( for @xmath549 ; frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) during the non - relativistic phase .",
    "therefore the observed radio fall - off implies that the radio emission from the envelope is optically thin at @xmath541 .",
    "then , equation ( [ nua ] ) leads to @xmath550 erg / sr .",
    "for such a low energy per solid angle in the envelope , the condition for non - relativistic motion at @xmath551 days becomes @xmath552 .",
    "making use of equation ( [ gamma ] ) , for this circumburst density , the optical core must have an energy per solid angle @xmath553 erg / sr for the core to remain relativistic untill at least 10 days and accommodate the observed steep optical decay .",
    "assuming the same microphysical parameters in the entire outflow , that @xmath554 ( ) implies that the peak flux of the core emission is much larger than that of the envelope emission .",
    "as it softens , the core emission should become brighter at radio frequencies than the envelope , therefore this scenario can not decouple the radio and optical emissions and can not account for the five anomalous afterglows .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the power - law decays of the radio and optical emissions of the grb afterglows 970508 , 980703 , 000418 , and 021004 are similar , as is expected in the simplest form of the relativistic fireball model ( adiabatic dynamics , uniform outflow , no energy injection , constant microphysical parameters ) .",
    "the shallow decay of the radio emission of the afterglow 010222 is only marginally compatible with that from a spreading jet but requires some extreme parameters (  [ jet2 ] ) .",
    "however , the shallow radio decay and the steep optical fall - off of the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , 000301 , and 000926 , can not be explained within the simplest afterglow model ( see also frail 2004 ) .",
    "the reason is that , for this model to explain the observations , the injection frequency @xmath42 should be between the radio and optical domains until about 100 days , which , as shown in  [ jet1 ] and  [ fballwind ] , leads to a radio emission much brighter than observed .",
    "we are thus forced to consider scenarios that decouple the radio and optical decay indices .",
    "assuming that the radio and optical emissions arise from the same population of electrons energized by the forward shock , we have investigated two scenarios involving microphysical parameters that vary in time .",
    "alternatively , the low and high frequency emissions may arise in different parts of the fireball if the outflow has an angular structure or if there is a long - lived reverse shock .    in the former category , we considered the case where there is no spectral break between the radio and optical domains , requiring a variable slope of the synchrotron spectrum , a time - varying slope of the electron power - law energy distribution @xmath119 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath30 can be determined (  [ varp ] ) by requiring that the resulting optical light - curve is a power - law in time , as the longest time coverage with the least measurement errors is achieved in this domain . for the five afterglows with shallow",
    "radio decays , we obtain that @xmath30 should increase in time , which implies that the optical spectrum should soften in time , the radio light - curves decay should steepen ( @xmath555 ) , while @xmath0-ray light - curves should flatten ( @xmath556 ) . with the exception of the afterglow 000301 , the resulting radio and @xmath0-ray light - curve decays and the optical spectral slope are in conflict with the observations .",
    "also in the first category , we investigated a scenario where the cooling frequency @xmath43 is between the radio and optical domains . in this case",
    "the optical and @xmath0-ray decays should to be identical , as for the afterglows 000926 and 010222 , but inconsistent with the observations for 991216 .",
    "to explain the shallowness of the radio decays and the steepness of the optical light - curves , @xmath43 must decrease faster than usually expected ( @xmath199 for a homogeneous medium ) , which requires an increasing magnetic field parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath9 and that of the parameter @xmath10 for minimal electron energy were determined from the observed radio and optical decay indices (  [ vareps ] ) .",
    "we found that , if there is no energy injection , for any geometry of the ejecta ( spherical or collimated ) and any radiative regime , @xmath10 must decrease and @xmath9 must increase with time , yost ( 2003 ) have found that good fits can be obtained for @xmath9 decreasing slower than @xmath557 or increasing slower than @xmath558 .",
    "for both a homogeneous or a wind - like medium , the increase of @xmath9 is so strong that the magnetic field @xmath559 is either constant or increases in time , which is not consistent with a field arising in a turbulent , decelerating flow , but could be compatible with a grb occurring in a pulsar bubble ( konigl & granot 2002 ) , where the fireball interacts with a magnetized medium , provided that a supernova occurred years before the burst .",
    "if there is energy injection , solutions with constant @xmath9 are possible ; however , this scenario leads to evolutions of the peak flux @xmath123 and injection frequency @xmath42 which are in contradiction with the behaviors inferred by galama ( 2001 ) for the afterglow 991208 from its radio observations . a magnetic field strength that decreases in time can obtained if the density of the circumburst medium increases with radius . in this case , the resulting evolutions of @xmath123 and @xmath42 are more consistent with the observations of 991208 if the outflow is collimated .",
    "we did not considered a scenario where all microphysical parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath30 ) evolve in time , such that the difference @xmath560 observed between the radio and optical decay indices is due both to a steepening electron distribution and a cooling frequency decreasing faster than usually .",
    "the increase of the electron index @xmath30 would reduce the required increase of @xmath9 , though a significant evolution of the former would probably lead to @xmath0-ray light - curve decays that are too steep compared with those observed for the afterglows 000926 and 010222 .    in the second type of scenarios , we have considered a dual outflow endowed with a uniform core of higher energy per solid angle , emitting the optical afterglow , surrounded by a uniform envelope of a lower energy density , releasing the radio afterglow .",
    "this scenario allows a better decoupling of the radio and optical emissions than for an outflow with a smooth angular structure , and finds support in the steepenings ( `` breaks '' ) observed in the decay of the optical afterglows 991216 , 000301 , 000926 , and 010222 , at around 1 day after the burst .",
    "such breaks are expected when the boundary of the optical core becomes visible to the observer .",
    "another possibility is that the low frequency afterglow emission arises in the semi - relativistic reverse shock occurring when there is a continuous inflow of ejecta into the fireball , while the higher frequency emission is ( as usually ) attributed to the forward shock . to explain the observed steepening of the optical decay",
    ", we have maintained the premise of a structured outflow , but we have ignored the radiation emitted by the envelope .    within the framework of these two scenarios , we required that the softening of the emission from the optically radiating region does not make its radio contribution overshine the low frequency emission from the radio emitting region .",
    "this requirement sets a lower bound ( ) on the injection frequency @xmath561 for the optical component at the time @xmath63 ( @xmath562 day ) when the optical light - curve break is observed . at the same time",
    ", we required that the shallower decaying emission from the radio component does not yield an optical contribution exceeding that arising from the optical region .",
    "this condition leads to an upper limit on the cooling frequency @xmath563 for the radio outflow ( ) .    for the anisotropic outflow scenario (  [ structure ] ) ,",
    "a stringent test is provided by the lower limit ( ) on the injection frequency of the radio emitting envelope which can be derived from that of the optical core . since the onset of the radio decay is due to the passage of the former injection frequency through the radio domain , the lower limit on it should be below 10 ghz . for the four afterglows ( 991208 , 991216 , 000926 , 010222 ) with slowly decaying radio emission and optical breaks compatible with a structured outflow , this condition is at best marginally satisfied . in those marginal cases , total electron energies exceeding equipartition with protons and very dense external media , leading to a self - absorbed radio emission and semi - relativistic fireball .",
    "therefore , the structured outflow scenario can not account for all the radio and optical properties of the above four afterglows .    in the reverse",
    " forward shock scenario (  [ reverse ] ) , we found that the sets of parameters describing the energy and mass injection which are self - consistent and which can explain the magnitude of the break observed in optical light - curves , correspond to a modest increase in the fireball energy , by less than a factor 2 . to explain the shallowness of the radio decay , the incoming ejecta must have an energy distribution which increases rapidly with decreasing lorentz factor : @xmath564 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath565 for a wind - like medium .",
    "an important constraint is provided by that the afterglow optical light - curves decay from the time @xmath382 of the first measurement , which requires that the lower bound on the forward shock injection frequency is redward of the optical domain at @xmath382 .",
    "this lower limit , the upper limit on the cooling frequency ( see above ) , the observed optical flux , and the condition that the reverse shock injection frequency crosses the radio domain when the radio decay starts , provide four constraints for the fireball kinetic energy per solid angle ( @xmath6 ) , external particle density ( @xmath16 ) , and microphysical parameters @xmath10 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we found that , to explain the properties of the radio and optical light - curves of the afterglows 991208 , 991216 , 000926 and 010222 , the reverse  forward shock scenario requires total electron energy and magnetic field parameters which are close to equipartition , circumburst particle densities between @xmath566 and @xmath567 , and low fireball kinetic energies ( upper limits ranging from @xmath568 to @xmath569 ergs / sr ) , which require a very efficient grb mechanism .",
    "these parameters are roughly consistent with those inferred through modeling of the afterglow broadband emission with the external shock only ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) .",
    "overall , the reverse  forward shock scenario is the most promising of all scenarios discussed here in accommodating the shallow radio decay observed for the five anomalous grb afterglows .",
    "a possibility not discussed so far is that the anomalous radio / optical afterglows are due to a new type of spectral break located between the radio and optical domains . such a feature has been used to explain the broadband emission of the afterglows 991208 and 000301 ( li & chevalier 2001 , panaitescu 2001 ) .",
    "the passage of this break frequency ( @xmath570 ) through the optical domain yields a softening of the optical spectral slope simultaneous to the light - curve break , as seems to have been the case for the afterglow 000301 . to determine the evolution of @xmath570 requires a measurement of the optical spectral slope @xmath570 is redward of the optical domain .",
    "such measurements exist only for the afterglows 991208 and 991216 , for which we find that @xmath571 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath572 for a wind - like medium , assuming that the ejecta are spherical .",
    "these scalings correspond to a break in the electron distribution at energy @xmath573 satisfying @xmath574 and @xmath575 , respectively , where @xmath437 is the fireball lorentz factor .",
    "while the former scaling has no obvious interpretation , the latter is not far from the @xmath576 expected for @xmath208 , if the total electron energy is assumed to be a constant fraction of the post - shock energy ."
