    "in the favored cold dark matter cosmology , present - day galaxies were assembled hierarchically from smaller building blocks at earlier cosmic times . since all nearby galaxies with stellar spheroids are observed to host nuclear smbhs @xcite , hierarchical merging leads inevitably to the formation of smbh binaries @xcite .",
    "if the binary lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers , then some galactic nuclei should contain systems of three or more smbhs .",
    "these systems are particularly interesting as they often lead to the ejection of one of the bhs at a speed comparable to the galactic escape velocity @xcite . in massive elliptical galaxies",
    "the typical speeds are @xmath2 , far greater than attainable through gravitational radiation recoil @xcite .    spatially resolved pairs of nuclei have been observed in a few active galaxies .",
    "the most famous example is ngc 6240 , an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) in which two distinct active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are clearly seen in hard x - rays at a projected separation of @xmath01 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed a variable uv source , possibly a second active nucleus , at a projected separation of @xmath3 pc from the primary nucleus in the spiral galaxy ngc 4736 , which shows signs of a recent merger . @xcite",
    "have detected what is thought to be an smbh binary at a projected separation of just 7.3 pc in the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 , through multi - frequency radio observations using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "we begin by discussing the theory of how such systems evolve , and the conditions under which they might acquire a third bh .",
    "when two galaxies merge , their dense nuclei sink to the center of the merger product by dynamical friction . as the nuclei spiral in",
    ", tidal forces gradually strip the two smbhs of their surrounding stars and dark matter . in mergers between galaxies of comparable mass ,",
    "the bhs are able to come together and form a bound smbh binary on a timescale of order @xmath4 yrs .",
    "the binary continues to harden by dynamical friction until it reaches a separation of order @xmath5 known as the `` hardening radius '' ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath6 is the reduced mass of the two bhs with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the velocity dispersion of the stars beyond the binary s sphere of gravitational influence , @xmath10 is the binary mass ratio @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the total mass of the binary . for smaller separations",
    "the binary looks like a point mass to the distant stars contributing to dynamical friction , but close stellar encounters preferentially harden the binary and so dominate further energy loss .",
    "only stars on nearly radial orbits , with periapsis distances of order the binary separation , can extract energy from ( `` harden '' ) the binary in this stage .",
    "these stars undergo strong 3-body interactions with the binary and escape its vicinity with speeds comparable to the black holes orbital speed . in the low - density nuclei of large elliptical galaxies , the total mass in stars on such `` loss cone '' orbits is small compared to the mass of the binary . furthermore the two - body stellar relaxation time",
    "is long compared to a hubble time , so once the stars initially on loss cone orbits are cleared out , the loss cone remains empty @xcite .",
    "since the binary must eject of order its own mass per @xmath13-folding in its semi - major axis , the system stops hardening around @xmath14 unless some other mechanism causes sufficient mass flux through the binary .",
    "if the binary reaches a separation around @xmath15^{1/4 } \\hspace{2pt } \\cdot \\notag \\\\ & \\left ( \\frac{\\tau_{gw}}{10^{10 } \\hspace{2pt } { \\rm yrs } } \\right)^{1/4 } f^{-1/4}(e ) \\hspace{6pt } { \\rm pc},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the orbital eccentricity of the binary and @xmath16 , then it can coalesce on a timescale @xmath17 through gravitational radiation @xcite . to get from @xmath14",
    "to @xmath18 it must bridge a gap @xmath19^{3/4}\\ ] ] by some mechanism other than stellar - dynamical friction or gravitational radiation .",
    "the question of whether and how it crosses this gap has become known as the `` final parsec problem '' @xcite .",
    "in many galaxies there probably are alternative mechanisms for crossing the gap .",
    "when gas - rich galaxies merge , tidal torques channel large amounts of gas into the central @xmath20 pc @xcite .",
    "the gas may lose energy through radiation and angular momentum through viscous torques , and is therefore not subject to a loss cone problem .",
    "using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations @xcite compute a merger time of order @xmath21 yrs in an environment typical of the central regions of ulirgs , which are thought to be gas - rich galaxies caught in the act of merging @xcite .",
    "the nuclei of galaxies are also observed to contain numerous massive perturbers ( mps ) such as star clusters , molecular clouds , and possibly intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "these objects scatter stars into the loss cone much more efficiently than other stellar mass objects , since the relaxation rate scales as the perturber mass for a fixed mass density of perturbers .",
    "@xcite extended the fokker - planck loss cone formalism @xcite to accomodate a spectrum of perturber masses and account for relaxation by rare close encounters with mps .",
    "they show that the population of known mps in the nucleus of the milky way is sufficient to bring a @xmath22 m@xmath23 bh binary to @xmath18 in @xmath24 yrs , and it is reasonable to expect similar perturber populations in other star - forming spiral galaxies .",
    "the final parsec problem is often mentioned as a caveat when predicting the smbh coalescence signal in low - frequency gravitational wave detectors such as the upcoming laser interferometer space anntena ( lisa ) .",
    "however the lisa event rate is expected to be dominated by small galaxies at high redshift @xcite , where the gas content and central densities tend to be high and the relaxation times short .",
    "for this reason _ the stalling problem is probably not a significant concern for the lisa smbh coalescence signal_. on the other hand bh ejections by gravitational radiation recoil @xcite may play an important role in the high - redshift coalescence rate .",
    "the long - term survival of smbh binaries is likewise unlikely in the gas - rich cores of quasars and ulirgs .",
    "however none of the gap - crossing mechanisms discussed so far are likely to reduce the coalescence time below a hubble time in mergers between giant , gas - poor elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that a significant fraction of stars on `` centrophilic '' orbits in a triaxial potential can greatly increase the mass flux into the loss cone .",
    "some non - axisymmetric potentials can also excite bar instabilities that cause rapid mass flow through the binary and efficient coalescence @xcite .",
    "however a central smbh can disrupt box orbits and induce axisymmetry in the inner regions of a triaxial galaxy @xcite , and it is uncertain how often these geometry - specific mechanisms bring the coalescence time below a hubble time .    one can naively assess the likelihood of coalescence by considering the `` full '' and `` empty '' loss cone hardening times , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , in the nuclei of various galaxies assuming a spherical and isotropic distribution function .",
    "@xmath25 is the hardening time assuming every star kicked out of the loss cone is instantly replaced , while @xmath26 is the time assuming stellar two - body relaxation to be the only replenishing mechanism .",
    "in small , dense galaxies @xmath27 yrs and @xmath28 yrs while in the lowest - density cores of giant ellipticals and cd galaxies @xmath29 yrs and @xmath30 yrs @xcite . while the empty loss cone rate is difficult to believe in any galaxy given at least some clustering on scales larger than 1 m@xmath23 , it also seems difficult to approach the full loss cone rate if there is no gas around and no strong radial bias in the stellar distribution . from this point of view",
    "the stalling of binaries seems unlikely in small galaxies but probable in low - density , gas - poor ellipticals .",
    "if some binaries do survive for around a hubble time , then the hierarchical buildup of galaxies will inevitably place three or more smbhs in some merging systems .",
    "an inspiralling satellite affects the evolution of a binary smbh even long before it sinks to the center , by perturbing the large - scale potential and scattering stars into the loss cone .",
    "we may estimate the extent of this effect as a function of satellite mass and distance from the center of the host galaxy using a rough but simple argument due to @xcite .",
    "the change in velocity necessary to deflect a star at radius @xmath10 into the loss cone is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic specific angular momentum of stars on loss cone orbits @xcite , @xmath33 is the smbhs radius of influence , and @xmath34 is the binary separation .",
    "the dynamical time at this radius is @xmath35 , so the acceleration required to scatter a star into the loss cone is roughly @xmath36 . equating this with the tidal acceleration caused by the satellite , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the satellite s radius , yields @xmath39 , or with @xmath40 , @xmath41^{1/3 } r.\\ ] ] the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath42 reflects the tidal stripping of the satellite as it spirals inward .",
    "equation   defines a critical radius @xmath10 , outside of which the satellite can deflect stars into ( and out of ) the loss cone in one dynamical time .",
    "the mass flux through the binary induced by the satellite is then approximately @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of the host galaxy at radius @xmath10 and @xmath45 is the geometrical factor accounting for the fraction of stars on loss cone orbits as a function of radius @xmath38 , assuming an isotropic distribution function @xcite . for a fixed satellite mass and distance",
    ", we can then define a `` binary feeding '' timescale by @xmath46    to determine whether the scattering of stars into the loss cone by the satellite is sufficient to harden the binary enough to prevent a close 3-body encounter before the intruder arrives at the galactic center , we must compare @xmath47 with the timescale on which the satellite spirals in by dynamical friction . in the approximation of slow inspiral",
    "we may write the dynamical friction timescale as @xmath48},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 in equation   is computed from @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mass of the host galaxy enclosed within radius @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath53 is the satellite mass contained within the tidal truncation radius obtained from a simple point mass approximation , @xmath54^{1/3 } r$ ] ( this slightly underestimates @xmath55 as the satellite approaches the center of the host ) . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath56 and @xmath47 as a function of @xmath38 for a satellite with one third the stellar mass of the host , which contains a binary with @xmath57 m@xmath23 .",
    "both host and satellite are modelled as hernquist profiles @xcite , with their masses and effective radii set by observed scaling relations .",
    "the details of the galactic model are described further in  2.1 - 2 .",
    ", on which an inspiralling satellite scatters mass into the loss cone of an smbh binary , with the dynamical friction timescale , @xmath56 , on which the satellite spirals in .",
    "upper ( red dashed ) line : @xmath47 computed from equation  ; lower curve : @xmath56 computed from equation  .",
    "both timescales are plotted as a function of the satellite s distance from the center of the host galaxy . for this plot",
    "we chose a binary mass of @xmath58 m@xmath23 and merger mass ratio of 3:1 in the stars .",
    "the galactic model is discussed in the text . ]",
    "since @xmath47 remains about an order of magnitude above @xmath56 throughout the inspiral , this simple calculation makes it plausible that the binary survives the merger process and undergoes close triple interactions with the infalling smbh .",
    "the tidal approximation ( as well as our treatment of dynamical friction ) breaks down as the satellite approaches @xmath59 , so the plot is cut off at a separation of @xmath20 pc , when the satellite still has @xmath04 @xmath13-foldings to go to reach @xmath14 .",
    "however this final stage of the inspiral is found to proceed very rapidly in n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the merger s effect on the binary may be dominated by violent relaxation or collective effects such as a bar instability @xcite , in which case our two - body approach does not capture its essence .",
    "the evolution of the core distribution function under the influence of a major merger is an intriguing open problem for simulators .    after the third bh becomes bound to the binary ( but still before the onset of close 3-body interactions ) another hardening mechanism may become important . if the angle of inclination @xmath60 of the outer binary ( formed by the intruder and the inner binary center - of - mass ( com ) ) exceeds a critical angle @xmath61 , then the quadrupolar perturbation from the intruder induces eccentricity oscillations through a maximum @xcite @xmath62 since the gravitational radiation rate increases sharply toward high eccentricities , these `` kozai oscillations '' can greatly enhance the radiation , possibly causing the binary to coalesce before it can undergo strong 3-body interactions with the intruder @xcite .",
    "general relativistic precession can destroy the kozai resonance ( e.g. @xcite ) , but @xcite find that this does not happen for @xmath63^{1/3 } \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e_{in}^{2}}{1-e_{out}^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the semi - major axes of the inner and outer binaries , @xmath66 is the outer binary mass ratio , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the inner and outer eccentricities .",
    "this leaves a window of about a factor of 10 in @xmath69 in which the kozai mechanism can operate before unstable 3-body interactions begin .",
    "the actual enhancement of the gravitational radiation rate of course depends on the amount of time spent at high eccentricity , but one may place an upper limit on the importance of kozai oscillations by computing the radiation timescale if the inner binary spends all of its time at @xmath70 . the orbit - averaged power radiated by gravitational radiation",
    "is given by @xmath71 @xcite , where @xmath72 is the semi - major axis and @xmath13 is the eccentricity . in fig .",
    "2 we plot contours of the gravitational radiation time @xmath73 in the @xmath72-@xmath60 plane by putting @xmath70 into equation  , for an equal - mass @xmath74 m@xmath23 binary .     m@xmath23 ) .",
    "the cosine of the initial inclination angle is plotted on the horizontal axis , and the inner binary semi - major axis is plotted on the vertical axis .",
    "contours are plotted for gravitational radiation timescales of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 yrs , if the binary were to stay at maximum eccentricity throughout the whole oscillation cycle .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the hardening radius and the separation such that a circular binary would coalesce on a @xmath79 yr timescale . ]",
    "this may seem like a gross overestimate of the gravitational radiation rate , especially since the shape of the kozai oscillations is in fact such that the binary spends more time near @xmath80 than near @xmath70 .",
    "however since @xmath17 is so strongly dominated by periapsis passages at @xmath81 , the shift in the contours for a realistic high-@xmath13 duty cycle is only modest .",
    "see @xcite for comparison with a detailed study of radiation enhancement by kozai oscillations in binaries with initial @xmath82 yrs . for a binary at @xmath14 , kozai oscillations can induce coalescence within @xmath76 yrs in @xmath83% of cases assuming @xmath84",
    "is uniformly distributed . in the remainder of cases",
    "the inner binary may survive until the outer binary shrinks to the point of unstable 3-body interactions .",
    "if the intruder comes close enough before it causes sufficient hardening of the ( inner ) binary , then a strong 3-body encounter takes place .",
    "strong encounters are characterized by a significant transfer of energy between the binary s internal degrees of freedom and the com motion of the binary and third body .",
    "when the intruder is slow relative to the binary s orbital speed @xmath85 , energy typically flows from the inner binary to the outer components , so that the binary is more strongly bound after the encounter .",
    "this is one manifestation of the negative specific heat characteristic of gravitationally bound systems .",
    "the encounter ends in the escape of one of the three bodies , usually the lightest , from the system at a speed comparable to @xmath85 .",
    "when the lightest body @xmath86 escapes , momentum conservation requires that the binary com recoil in the opposite direction with a speed smaller by a factor @xmath87 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the expected ejection velocities of the binary and @xmath86 with the typical galactic escape velocity . for a circular binary with @xmath88 , the binding energy at the hardening radius",
    "is @xmath89^{3/2}$ ] erg .",
    "the binding energy at the radius where @xmath90 yrs is @xmath91^{5/4}$ ] erg .",
    "the mean energy @xmath92 harvested from the binary in close encounters with slow intruders is about @xmath93 , though the median @xmath92 is somewhat lower @xcite .",
    "energy conservation implies that the escaper leaves the system with kinetic energy @xmath94 $ ] while the binary leaves with @xmath95 $ ] in the system com frame . for an equal mass binary with @xmath96 m@xmath23 ,",
    "this gives ejection velocities of @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the binary at @xmath14 , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the binary at @xmath18 .",
    "any nonzero eccentricity of the binary will increase the semi - major axis corresponding to a fixed @xmath17 , lowering the ejection velocities for the binary at @xmath18 .",
    "also any deviation from equal masses will result in a smaller fraction of the extracted energy being apportioned to the binary and a smaller binary recoil velocity .",
    "the typical escape velocity for galaxies hosting @xmath101 m@xmath23 bhs is around 1500 @xmath102 , accounting for both the stars and the dark matter .",
    "from these numbers , it appears that single escapes will be fairly common as repeated encounters harden the binary to @xmath103 .",
    "however accounting for realistic mass ratios and eccentricities ( the first 3-body encounter tends to thermalize the eccentricity even if it starts off circular ) , binary escapes should be rare .",
    "since the binary must come near the escape velocity to remain outside the nucleus for a significant amount of time , we do not expect triple interactions to empty many nuclei of bhs .",
    "we will quantify these statements with our triple - bh simulations .",
    "the formation of triple smbh systems through inspiral of a merging satellite leads to a rather specific initial configuration .",
    "the three bhs start off as a bound `` hierarchical triple , '' consisting of an inner binary with @xmath104 and a more widely separated outer binary with semi - major axis @xmath65 .",
    "for very large @xmath69 we expect hierarchical triples to exhibit very regular behavior ; in this case the third body sees the inner binary as a point mass and the system essentially consists of two independent ( inner and outer ) binaries .",
    "however as @xmath69 approaches unity , secular evolution gives way to chaotic 3-body interactions in which the orbits diverge and the system becomes subject to escape of one its components .",
    "@xcite derive a criterion for the stability of 3-body systems based on an analogue with the problem of binary tides .",
    "the most distant intruder orbit at which unstable interactions can begin is reliably estimated by @xmath105^{2/5},\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the periapsis separation of the outer binary , @xmath64 is the semimajor axis of the inner binary , @xmath107 is the outer binary mass ratio , and @xmath68 is its eccentricity .",
    "this criterion has great practical importance due to the high numerical cost of unnecessarily following weak hierarchical systems .",
    "it specifies an optimal starting point for our simulations , which aim to study strong interactions in 3-body systems starting off as hierarchical triples .    naively one might expect a strong 3-body encounter following a merger with a galaxy hosting a binary , so long as the intruder does not induce coalescence of the binary before it reaches the center .",
    "however the stability criterion implies a condition for close interactions much more stringent than this . to undergo a chaotic encounter with the inner binary",
    ", the intruder must reach the stability boundary before the outer binary hardens and stalls .",
    "a triple system covers somewhat more stellar phase space than a binary of the same size , but not by much for a stable hierarchical system .",
    "this means that the merger process can not cause the binary to harden by more than around an @xmath13-folding for a nearly circular , equal - mass system before the intruder arrives at the center .",
    "though the order - of - magnitude estimates in the previous section make this plausible , further study is needed to determine the likelihood of unstable triple interactions in realistic merger situations .",
    "an eccentric outer binary relaxes the criterion somewhat , but dynamical friction tends to circularize the orbits of satellites with moderate initial eccentricities before they reach the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume near - circular initial orbits and begin each simulation from a weakly hierarchical configuration .",
    "triple smbh systems in galactic nuclei were first considered by @xcite , who computed an extensive series of newtonian 3- and 4-body orbits , and compared the slingshot ejection statistics to the observed structure of extragalactic radio sources .",
    "@xcite included a gravitational radiation drag force in the 3-body dynamics .",
    "he showed that this perturbing force could in some cases yield much higher ejection velocities than would be possible in newtonian gravity , with associated bursts of gravitational waves .",
    "the more complex problem of three or four smbhs coming together in the hierarchical merging process and interacting in a galactic potential was first addressed by @xcite and @xcite , who experimented with a variety of initial bh configurations . @xcite",
    "studied binary - binary scattering in galactic nuclei using initial conditions ( ics ) based on extended press schechter theory @xcite .",
    "@xcite followed the formation of triple bh systems in halo merger trees tracking the hierarchical buildup of smbhs from @xmath108 m@xmath23 seeds in high-@xmath9 peaks at @xmath109 . using a simple analytic prescription for the ejection velocities",
    ", they inferred the presence of a large population of smbhs and imbhs wandering through the halos of galaxies and intergalactic space .",
    "@xcite performed the first full n - body simulations of equal - mass triple bh systems embedded in stellar bulges , an important contribution to our understanding of galactic nuclei .",
    "because of the large computation time required for each run , they could not statistically sample the highly varied outcomes of the 3-body encounters as the previous authors did .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of repeated triple - smbh interactions in galactic nuclei . between close encounters",
    "we follow the wandering bhs through the galaxy as their orbits decay by dynamical friction .",
    "we use physically - motivated initial bh configurations and mass distributions , and updated galactic models characteristic of the low - density , massive elliptical galaxies in which smbh binaries are most likely stall . we include both a stellar and a dark matter component , with the stellar spheroid fixed to lie on the observed @xmath110 and @xmath111 relations @xcite .",
    "the close encounters are treated using a ks - regularized bulirsch - stoer integrator provided by sverre aarseth @xcite .",
    "the inner density profile is updated throughout the simulations to roughly account for core heating by dynamical friction and stellar mass ejection .",
    "gravitational radiation losses are modelled as a drag force determined by the relative coordinates and velocities of each pair .",
    "each simulation takes only a few minutes to run , so we can try a variety of distributions of ics and statistically sample the outcomes for each .",
    "we use this algorithm to study a variety of consequences of the ongoing encounters , such as the merging efficiency of bh pairs , the time spent wandering at various distances from the galactic center , the distribution of final sizes and eccentricities of the binaries remaining in the galaxy after a steady state has been reached , and the extent of the core scouring caused by the triple smbh systems .    aside from the motivating order - of - magnitude calculations in previous sections , this paper does not address the question of _ whether _ close triple smbh systems form in galactic nuclei .",
    "we start our simulations from a state that the system must reach shortly before the onset of unstable 3-body interactions _ assuming _ that they occur , and proceed to derive the subsequent evolution .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ obsmbh ]    for the rest of the galaxies we used the @xcite @xmath356 relation to estimate the bh masses in galaxies with @xmath357 , and the @xcite @xmath110 relation for those with @xmath358 . showing both plots gives an idea of how much the mass deficits vary with @xmath202 estimator",
    ".    in set cn @xmath011% of the runs resulted in cores with @xmath359 . in some rare runs where the binary was ejected to a large distance and then brought back by dynamical friction",
    ", we obtained even higher mass deficits ( up to @xmath360 ) .",
    "the binary is more efficient at core scouring than the single bh since it is more massive .",
    "if each independent binary inspiral adds @xmath361 to the mass deficit , then the mean @xmath362 enhancement of @xmath361 due to the triple encounters is equivalent to one extra merger in the system s history .",
    "an @xmath362 one standard deviation above the mean is equivalent to two extra mergers .",
    "triple - smbh systems in galactic nuclei produce a range of phenomena and signatures rather different from those expected if no more than two smbhs occupy them at a time .",
    "we have developed an efficient numerical method for following the evolution of 3-body systems in the centers of galaxies , and used it to explore the outcomes of such encounters in massive elliptical galaxies at low redshift .",
    "we find a high efficiency of smbh coalescence due to the encounters , providing a `` last resort '' solution to the final parsec problem .",
    "there is , however , a caveat in extending this result immediately to all bh masses .",
    "if we define @xmath363 to be the binary semi - major axis where escape of one bh first becomes likely ( @xmath364 where @xmath365 is a factor of order 10 for a hernquist profile ) , then since @xmath366 we have @xmath367 if @xmath222 obeys the @xmath110 relation @xmath368 , so @xmath369 .",
    "in other words , at smaller bh masses , the lightest bh is more likely to escape the galaxy before driving the binary to coalescence by gravitational radiation . by focusing on massive galaxies",
    "we have chosen the systems where the binary is _ least _ likely to coalesce by other means ( e.g. gas or massive perturbers ) , and _ most _ likely to coalesce in the next merger with the help of 3-bh interactions .",
    "we may address the efficiency of triple - induced coalescence in much smaller - mass systems in future studies .",
    "we find that close triple encounters can produce a population of high - eccentricity binaries , whose gravitational radiation signal could potentially be observable by lisa .",
    "such signals originate from kozai oscillations in hierarchical triples at high initial inclinations and highly eccentric binaries formed following distant ejections . as the eccentricity increases , the radiation spectrum peaks at progressively higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency , approaching a nearly flat spectrum as @xmath370 @xcite .",
    "a circular @xmath371 m@xmath23 bh binary remains below the band of frequencies ( @xmath372 hz ) detectable by lisa throughout its inspiral , but the occurrence of high - eccentricity coalescences could extend lisa s sensitivity into this mass range , or lengthen the duration of its sensitivity to @xmath373 m@xmath23 events .",
    "a highly eccentric binary produces a `` spiky '' waveform that looks quite different from that of a circular system ( see fig . 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational radiation `` spikes '' at very close approaches during chaotic 3-body interactions could also produce radiation bursts detectable by lisa .",
    "if triple encounters are indeed limited to massive systems at low redshift , then the importance of these considerations is limited by the expected event rate in this mass range , assuming efficient coalescence .",
    "this rate is highly uncertain , ranging from @xmath374 @xcite to @xmath375 @xcite depending on the merger and bh population model adopted .",
    "if 3-bh systems occur in other contexts , e.g. imbhs in galactic nuclei or star clusters , then the phenomena we have discussed may be observationally relevant even if the high - mass smbh event rate is low .",
    "a detailed look at the gravitational waveforms expected from 3-body encounters and their expected detection rates is an interesting topic for a future study .",
    "the slingshot ejections in triple encounters produce a population of `` wandering '' smbhs in and outside the halos of galaxies . in systems that have undergone several major dry mergers ( e.g. cd galaxy systems )",
    ", one might expect a few such ejected smbhs to be floating in the vicinity .",
    "as of yet , no probable way of observing these wandering bhs has been proposed . in principle one",
    "can imagine a star bound to the ejected smbh entering a giant phase and overflowing its roche lobe , producing some accretion onto the smbh and an observable flare .",
    "single ejections could also in principle affect bh - bulge correlations such as the @xmath110 relation , but since it is the lightest bh that gets ejected this effect would fall well within the observed scatter in the correlations for just one or two ejection events .",
    "triple interactions in galactic nuclei can have a large effect on the expected properties of stable smbh binaries in the local universe . while many models of binary formation predict mostly circular binaries around @xmath14 , 3-body encounters produce binaries at all eccentricities .",
    "they also create a population of stalled binaries at separations significantly smaller than @xmath14 but still larger than @xmath18 , as does any partial gap - crossing mechanism .",
    "better measurements and statistics on the mass deficits in cored elliptical galaxies may provide clues on the history of the nuclear smbh activity in these systems .",
    "triple bh encounters produce a highly scattered distribution of core sizes , with mass deficits up to @xmath376 higher than expected for successive binary coalescences .",
    "the apparent peak at mass deficits of @xmath377 times the nuclear bh mass in observed cores may very tentatively hint that multiple - bh encounters are not the norm in these systems .",
    "this signature of binary or multiple - bh activity is appealling because ( a ) its duty cycle is the lifetime of the galaxy ; ( b ) it is present whether binary pairs stall or coalesce ; and ( c ) it can be observed even in the complete absence of radiative activity , such as disk accretion or jet production .",
    "however the interpretation of galaxy cores is complicated by multiple mergers , the possibility of partial stellar cusp regeneration from traces of cold gas , and observational complications such as projection effects in nonspherical galaxies and optimizing the fitting / extrapolation algorithm to best represent the mass deficit .",
    "there is a need for theoretical studies on the cores produced by smbh mergers in triaxial galaxies , since triaxility seems to be the most likely candidate for a gap - crossing mechanism in dry mergers between gas - poor , giant ellipticals .",
    "inferring the nuclear histories of galaxies from their observed core properties will likely be a topic of much interest in the future .",
    "we would like to thank suvendra dutta for technical help at the parallel computing center of the institute for theory and computation ( itc ) , and sverre aarseth and seppo mikkola for making their n - body algorithms and codes available .",
    "we are also grateful to scott hughes , michael eracleous , marta volonteri , and fred rasio for useful discussions .",
