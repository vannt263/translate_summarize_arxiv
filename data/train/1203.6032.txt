    "large scale magnetic fields of varying amplitudes are present in entire galaxy clusters , individual galaxies and high redshift condensations . such fields are observed on characteristic scales of @xmath0 mpc and are of micro - gauss strength , @xmath1 g @xcite . despite their ubiquity ,",
    "their origin is still a mystery .",
    "there are literally tens of candidate mechanisms proposed to explain the origin and evolution of such fields , spanning different theories of physics @xcite .",
    "it is now widely believed that the structure of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies is consistent with the dynamo amplification mechanism .",
    "the dynamo mechanism can produce amplification factors of up to @xmath2 but requires a seed field in order to operate and thus can not explain the origin of magnetic fields .",
    "additionally , adiabatic contraction of magnetic flux lines during structure formation can enhance galactic fields by a factor of @xmath3 .    among the physical mechanisms proposed to explain the origin of the seed field is one due to harrison @xcite .",
    "this mechanism rests on the fact that non - zero vorticity in the pre - recombination photon - baryon plasma can generate weak magnetic fields of about @xmath4 g. however , vorticity is not a generated mode at first order in perturbation theory and has to be put in as an initial condition .",
    "second order treatments of the pre - recombination plasma in terms of a kinetic theory description has also been used to generate the required seed fields @xcite .",
    "the key idea is a preferential thompson scattering of photons off free electrons , over the scattering off protons ( the scattering off protons is suppressed by a factor @xmath5 ) which induces differences in the proton and electron velocity fields .",
    "electric fields are then induced to counter charge separation between the electrons and protons .",
    "the generated electric fields will then feed in the magnetic induction equation to generate magnetic fields at second order in perturbation theory .",
    "the photon anisotropic stress also couples to the electron velocities and contributes to the magnetic field sources .",
    "in addition , other arguments relying on electroweak phase transitions @xcite , topological defects @xcite , velocity perturbations @xcite etc . have been proposed as candidate mechanisms .",
    "the generated fields , however , are usually too weak to leave any detectable imprint on the cmb @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given the form of the fluid quantities of a magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the energy density @xmath6 , the isotropic pressure @xmath7 and the anisotropic pressure @xmath8 of a field generated at second order will manifest at fourth order in perturbation theory , which is not relevant for cmb anisotropies .",
    "in addition to meeting the right strengths , the generated fields must be of the right scale to match those observed today .",
    "one of the problems of primordial generation mechanisms in general is that although some may reach the required strengths , they are causal in nature .",
    "this means that their coherence scales can not exceed the hubble scale during the time of magnetic field generation . by comparison ,",
    "the galactic scale today is well outside the hubble scale at such early epochs .",
    "moreover , the small scale fields i.e , those that are already sub - horizon before matter - radiation equality can not reach the recombination epoch due to micro - physical mechanisms such as magnetic and photon diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "inflation and other pre - big bang models capable of causally producing super horizon perturbations are often invoked to circumvent this scale problem . however , the residual magnetic fields surviving the exponential expansion accompanying many inflationary models are thought to be too weak to be of cosmological relevance .",
    "new physics often has to be introduced such as exotic couplings of the electromagnetic field to other fields such as the dilaton field to avoid the accompanying exponential dilution of the magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the primordial fields are also constrained by the fact that the anisotropic stress of the produced magnetic fields contains a spin-2 component and will result in an overproduction of gravitational waves at horizon crossing which is inconsistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis constraints @xcite .    apart from studying the generation of magnetic fields",
    ", one can also study interactions of a pre - existing magnetic field with gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "this is often studied in the context of amplification of the seed magnetic field or gravitational wave detection .",
    "much progress has been made in this area @xcite .",
    "most of these studies however have been restricted to focusing on the interaction of magnetic fields with tensor perturbations ; in this work we revisit and extend the work presented in @xcite , to include scalar perturbations in the matter fluctuations .",
    "when using perturbation theory about a flrw background to study the interaction , one is immediately faced with the problem of how to embed the seed magnetic field into the background .",
    "the isotropy of the flrw spacetime does not readily allow for any direction preference that may be introduced by a vector field .",
    "there are several ways to handle this and we mention briefly just three of them .",
    "one can treat the seed magnetic field as a zeroth order quantity , subject to the assumption that the energy density of the field be small compared to the energy density of matter @xmath9 and that the anisotropic stress is negligible @xmath10 . with these approximations ,",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field can not alter the gravitational dynamics of the background spacetime ; this approach is often referred to as the weak - field approximation .",
    "another approach is to treat the seed field as a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random field with @xmath11 but @xmath12 and so , the seed field does not introduce any directional dependence in the background spacetime .",
    "one can then easily employ statistical methods to quantify the field s behavior .",
    "another possibility is to leave the background spacetime untouched but treat the seed field as a first order perturbation , using a two parameter approximation scheme to characterize the perturbations in the electromagnetic and gravitational field ; this is the approach we adopt in this work .",
    "one can go a long way in comparing the different perturbation schemes .",
    "for example , in the weak - field approximation , the induced magnetic field will be at first order , a well understood regime in perturbation theory . while in the two parameter case",
    ", the induced field will be at second order , as second order , with evident misuse of terminology . in the rest of the work",
    ", we will refer to quantities of this order simply as non - linear and reserve the designation ` second order ' to quantities of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 a regime that is not so well developed .",
    "nevertheless , for the purposes of our work , the two approaches are mathematically equivalent",
    ". the apparent differences between them is as a result of relabeling of spacetimes , i.e. ` first order ' in the weak - field approximation corresponds to ` second order ' in the two parameter case .",
    "indeed , maxwell s equations and thus the einstein - maxwell system takes the same mathematical form in both of these approaches .",
    "they both use the machinery of relativistic perturbation theory and are thus prone to gauge issues , see @xcite for example .",
    "the present article is structured as follows : we present details of our perturbative framework in ",
    "[ sec : framework ] . after a presentation of the interaction equations in  [ sec : interaction ]",
    ", we present the derivation of the equations describing the induction of em fields in  [ sec : efield ] and [ sec : bfield ] for a general current and a note on how to evaluate the induced electrical current in  [ sec : current ] .",
    "we present the power spectra of the induced magnetic field variable in  [ sec : powerspec ] and finally a summary in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we employ the 1 + 3 covariant approach to perturbation theory @xcite and follow @xcite by adopting the more geometrically motivated metric signature @xmath15 and we use geometrized units @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "one of the nice aspects of the 1 + 3 covariant approach to general relativity ( gr ) is that the underlying dynamical equations have a stronger appeal from a physical point of view , as compared to the quasi - linear , second - order partial differential equation form , which the efe take in the metric based approach .",
    "the approach is based on a 1 + 3 decomposition of geometric quantities with respect to a fundamental four velocity @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 are general coordinates and @xmath22 measures the proper time along the world line .",
    "the key equations governing the full structure of the spacetime are derived from the ricci and the once and twice contracted bianchi identities applied to the 4-velocity vector @xcite .",
    "this splitting uniquely defines two projection tensors @xmath23 which project along and orthogonal to the 4-velocity @xmath19 .",
    "we define two projected covariant derivatives , the convective time derivative along @xmath19 and the spatially projected covariant derivative @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the basic equations are then characterized by the irreducible parts of the first covariant derivative of @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the relativistic acceleration vector representing the effect of inertial forces on the fluid ; @xmath28 is the rate of volume expansion ; @xmath29 is the symmetric trace - free rate of shear tensor , describing the rate of distortion of the fluid flow ; @xmath30}$ ] is the antisymmetric vorticity tensor , describing the rigid rotation of the fluid relative to a non - rotating frame .",
    "we choose as our background the flrw models , which are spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "thus , relative to the congruence @xmath25 , the kinematical variables have to be locally isotropic , which implies the vanishing of the 4-acceleration @xmath31 , the rate of shear @xmath32 and the vorticity vector @xmath33 .",
    "spatial homogeneity implies that the spatial gradients of the energy density @xmath34 , pressure @xmath35 , and the expansion @xmath36 vanish , i.e @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the flrw spacetime is characterized by a perfect fluid matter tensor , i.e @xmath38 .",
    "these restrictions imply that the spacetime is conformally flat , i.e the electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor vanish , @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to the key background equations , the energy conservation equation @xmath40 the raychaudhuri equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 and the friedmann equation @xmath43",
    "as already mentioned , a flrw spacetime can not readily host magnetic fields , as their anisotropic stresses @xmath44 will break the isotropy .",
    "we thus treat the background magnetic field @xmath45 as a first order perturbation to the isotropic spacetime .",
    "this lends the energy density , the isotropic and anisotropic pressure of the field to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "we then proceed by adopting a two parameter perturbative framework @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , this consists of separately parametrizing the gravitational and maxwell field perturbations in two expansion parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , representing the amplitudes of the gravitational and electromagnetic field perturbations , respectively @xcite . using this parametrization , any quantity @xmath48 in the physical spacetime",
    "can be expanded in the form , @xmath49 where the first term on the right represents the background term ; the first and second terms represent the first order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations respectively ; the fourth term represents the non - linear coupling we re looking to investigate ; the higher order terms represent self - coupling terms of order @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in general , terms describing the coupling will be of the form @xmath53 , where , in this work , we restrict the perturbative order to @xmath54 and therefore neglect terms of order @xmath55 , @xmath56 and higher , resulting from the self - coupling of the fields ; this includes gravitational couplings with the magnetic anisotropy @xmath57 , leading to @xmath56 terms .",
    "we will generally refer to quantities of order @xmath58 simply as non - linear and reserve the designation ` second order ' for terms that are of order @xmath13 and @xmath59 . as in @xcite",
    ", one can visualize this framework as a hierarchy of spacetimes to label the different perturbative orders .",
    "we make the common assumption in the literature that the perturbed spacetimes have the same manifold as the background spacetime i.e. we consider the perturbations as fields propagating on the background spacetime @xcite . in this treatment , therefore , we restrict the possibility that the perturbations may alter the differential structure of the background manifold and so we neglect issues of backreaction .",
    "we re also interested in studying this coupling in a gauge - invariant manner .",
    "the gauge problem in relativistic perturbation theory has been dealt with in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "the stewart & walker lemma @xcite serves as a basis for the generalization of gauge invariance to arbitrary order @xcite .",
    "it follows that a quantity @xmath60 is gauge invariant at order @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 and its perturbations of order lower than @xmath63 are either vanishing , or a constant scalar or a combination of kronecker deltas with constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "since the interaction terms are of order @xmath58 we have that the induced magnetic field @xmath64 will be of the same order ; we also assume that the electric field @xmath65 will be of the same order as the induced magnetic field .",
    "clearly @xmath64 does not satisfy the criteria for gauge invariance at @xmath66 since it is neither vanishing nor a constant scalar at @xmath67 . to this end",
    ", we make use of the same auxiliary variable @xmath68 identified in @xcite",
    ". we do not however integrate @xmath69 to recover the gauge - dependent magnetic field , but treat it as the fundamental variable whose deviation from zero quantifies deviation from the adiabatic decay of the magnetic field .",
    "the einstein - maxwell equations  [ eq : max ] contain terms that couple the electromagnetic fields to the gravitational fields .",
    "these can be written at @xmath70 by discarding higher order terms .",
    "this results in the two propagation equations , @xmath71 subject to the constraints , @xmath72 . following @xcite",
    "we make the following comments : ( i ) the magnetic field @xmath45 appearing in the equations  [ eq : induction_b ] and  [ eq : induction_e ] multiplied by the gravitational variables should not be the same as the @xmath64 appearing alone .",
    "the variable @xmath73 is a mixture of linear and non - linear quantities ( the seed magnetic field and the induced field ) while the terms involving @xmath74 are a product of first order quantities .",
    "one has to keep this in mind when integrating the equations .",
    "( ii ) the system is not gauge - invariant as already mentioned in   [ sec : framework ] .",
    "this can be attributed to the mixture of linear and non - linear terms in the system . in the covariant approach to perturbation theory ,",
    "the solution of perturbed differential operators is never sought , one can get around this by making sure that the differential operators involved operate on quantities of the corresponding perturbative order .    in an attempt to cast it in a consistent and gauge invariant manner ,",
    "we introduce the following non - linear variables : the fundamental variable @xmath69 measuring deviation from adiabatic decay , @xmath75 describing the interaction with shear distortions and @xmath76 describing interaction with density perturbations .",
    "these are defined as , @xmath77 and results in the following system , @xmath78 where we have written @xmath79 and @xmath80 for brevity .",
    "we treat the seed magnetic field as a first order perturbation to the spacetime .",
    "the seed field may have its origins in inflation or other mechanisms based on string cosmology , in which electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations are amplified due to a dynamical dilaton or an inflaton field @xcite .",
    "we assume that at order @xmath67 the electric fields are small compared to the magnetic fields , i.e @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the absence of diffusive losses or amplification , the induction equation [ eq : induction_b ] takes the frozen - in form , @xmath83 regardless of the equation of state or plasma properties of the cosmic fluid .",
    "it follows then that the magnetic field decays adiabatically as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "this adiabatic decay arises from the expansion of the universe which conformally dilutes the field lines due to flux conservation .",
    "the frozen - in condition  [ eq : induction ] does not discriminate between homogeneous ( @xmath86 ) and inhomogeneous ( @xmath87 ) magnetic fields . for an inhomogeneous field the spatial gradients of the seed magnetic field @xmath88 are of the same order as @xmath45 and evolve as @xmath89 .",
    "the weyl tensor @xmath91 represents the free gravitational field , enabling gravitational action at a distance . in analogy with splitting the maxwell field tensor @xmath92 into a magnetic and an electric field ,",
    "@xmath91 can be split covariantly into a ` magnetic ' part @xmath93 and an ` electric ' part @xmath94 .",
    "the electric part of the weyl tensor describes tidal effects , akin to the tidal tensor associated with the newtonian potential , while the magnetic part describes the propagation of gravitational radiation .",
    "the weyl tensor vanishes in the conformally flat flrw spacetime and so @xmath95 and @xmath96 are covariant first order gauge invariant ( fogi ) quantities in the weyl curvature .",
    "we also define the fogi variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 to characterize density perturbations .",
    "now , the system governing gravitational perturbations is given by the following propagation equations , , is obtained from the ricci identities applied to the whole spacetime ;  [ eq : propmagh ] and [ eq : propelecw ] are obtained from the once contracted bianchi identities ;  [ eq : density ] and [ eq : expansion ] are obtained by taking spatial gradients of the energy conservation and raychaudhuri equation , respectively ]    @xmath99    in addition to the propagation equations above , the following constraints have to be satisfied , @xmath100 where we have set the vorticity to zero ( @xmath33 ) , see also @xcite .",
    "note that at first order in gravitational perturbations , the only source of vector modes is the vorticity @xmath101 ; since , we neglect the effects of vorticity , @xmath33 , all the vector modes vanish .",
    "the shear tensor @xmath102 can then be irreducibly split into scalar and tensor contributions as @xcite @xmath103 the pure tensor modes can be used to characterize gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the scalar part of the shear couples to density perturbations and is related to the clumping of matter via the constraints  [ eq : constraints ] .    by differentiating  [ eq : propshear ] and using [ eq : propelecw ] and",
    "one of the constraints [ eq : constraints ] to substitute for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , one arrives at a forced wave equation for the shear , @xmath104\\sigma_{ab}= -\\frac{w}{a^{2}(1+w)}\\left[\\dot{\\mathcal{x}}_{ab } + \\frac{1}{3}\\theta \\mathcal{x}_{ab } \\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 .",
    "we need an evolution equation for @xmath106 in order to close equation [ eq : shearscal ] .",
    "one can start from  [ eq : density ] and  [ eq : expansion ] to write a wave equation for @xmath107 then taking the comoving spatial gradient of the resulting wave equation will yield the following , @xmath108    in including scalar perturbations , we have explicitly coupled the shear tensor to density perturbations .",
    "this shows that density gradients source distortions in the weyl curvature and vice versa .",
    "hence , knowing the shear allows one to compute density gradients and knowing density gradients one can compute the scalar part of the shear @xcite .",

    "a noteworthy feature is the rapid decay of @xmath75 for both scalars and tensors .",
    "although the interaction with scalar perturbations decays slightly slower , it essentially follows the same trend as the interaction with gravitational waves .",
    "we are thus led to conclude that even including scalar perturbations in the interaction , we reach the same conclusion as @xcite and @xcite that there is no significant amplification of electromagnetic fields coming from the interaction .        the effect of the gravitational perturbations on the interaction is thought to be largest at the point where the modes enter the horizon .",
    "this is clearly evident in figures [ fig : tensor ] and [ fig : scalar ] .",
    "a couple of features are worth noting from figure  [ fig : tensor ] .",
    "one is that the spectrum for the interaction variable mimics that of gravitational waves .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that gravitational waves start oscillating at horizon crossing .",
    "this is to be expected since although for a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath45 , the product @xmath229 becomes a convolution in fourier space , @xmath230 , we have only considered the mode - mode coupling case , @xmath231 .",
    "the power spectra for the case of interaction with scalars are not as interesting .",
    "there is no scale dependence on the interaction variable @xmath75 , cf equation [ har : interaction ] .",
    "this is because the laplacian term for scalar perturbations comes from the acceleration vector which is identically zero in the dust case @xmath232",
    ". it would be interesting to generalize our treatment to include the case of non - zero pressure .",
    "this will lend us to the radiation dominated era where one can incorporate photons in the plasma and can consider collisional effects as was done in @xcite for example .",
    "one could treat the interesting case of simultaneous generation and amplification of magnetic fields by coalescing these phenomenon .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of the coupling between gravitational perturbations with electromagnetic fields as a possible means for magnetic field amplification .",
    "this carries to completion the work began in @xcite and @xcite . in agreement with the work of @xcite and @xcite",
    "we argue that there is no significant amplification resulting from the interaction of magnetic field with gravitational waves .",
    "even with the inclusion of density perturbations , the induced fields may still be orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "this justifies the perturbative treatment and our neglect of backreaction .",
    "the induction of electromagnetic fields due to the interaction of a test magnetic field with gravitational waves was studied in @xcite using the weak - field approximation .",
    "we included this study here treating the background magnetic field as a first order perturbation and recovered similar results .",
    "this shows that there is no fundamental difference between the two approaches , apart from a labeling of spacetimes , which should not affect physical results .",
    "we also extended this study by using a proper non - linear perturbative framework .",
    "this framework was applied in @xcite , but an erroneous argument there led to the neglect of the rotation of the electric field , thus restricting the study to perfectly conducting environments .",
    "this was refuted in @xcite .",
    "in fact , upon inspection of [ eq : inits ] one can conclude that even if one initially sets the rotation of the electric field to zero , @xmath233 there are non - zero terms on the right hand side of the initial conditions for @xmath234 that will seed a non - zero @xmath235 .",
    "we also carry to completion the work in @xcite by doing a proper extraction of the scalar and tensor modes and numerical integrations . in terms of the conductivity of the cosmic medium , @xcite restricted their study to poor conducting mediums , @xcite to perfectly conducting mediums and @xcite treated the mhd approximation .",
    "we carried our analysis for all three cases .",
    "we find that for tensor perturbations , the ideal mhd approximation is just the same as the perfect conductivity assumption of the fluid treatment . for scalar perturbations",
    ", we find an additional source term in the induced field ( compared with perfectly conducting environments ) due to the coupling of the seed field with scalar velocity perturbations .",
    "the current term @xmath126 was neglected at all orders in @xcite , in an attempt presumably to uphold the background magnetic field s homogeneity condition @xmath86 . however , this is not necessary since introducing the current term at the non - linear order does not break the condition @xmath86 .",
    "also , one can not consistently invoke ohm s law for poor and perfect conducting environments without a current term . in @xcite , an inhomogeneous seed field",
    "was assumed thereby requiring a first order current @xmath236 to uphold the condition @xmath87 .",
    "however , after decoupling ( which is the era considered there ) , thompson scattering is no longer efficient .",
    "thus electrons and ions are tightly coupled by coulomb scattering at first order .",
    "their velocity fields are therefore equal as they form a perfectly coupled baryon fluid @xcite .",
    "there can be therefore no currents generated at this order and the condition @xmath237 will render the seed field homogeneous .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite integrate @xmath69 to recover the amplified magnetic field , after specifying a frame @xmath19 .",
    "while this takes into account the frame dependence of the magnetic field @xmath64 , it invalidates gauge invariance as the recovered @xmath64 remains gauge dependent and takes the same value and form as it would have without the introduction of @xmath69 .",
    "this is already pointed out in @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not integrate @xmath69 but simply note that one can assign a physical meaning to the magnetic field variable @xmath69 by noting that @xmath238 describes the background adiabatic decay of the fields . any deviation from @xmath238",
    "would then imply amplification of the background field .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 is a linear combination of terms that source magnetic fields through the induction equation [ eq : induction_b ] .",
    "thus we can estimate the relative importance of each source term through @xmath69 without having to integrate it to recover the gauge - dependent @xmath73 .",
    "for example , we see from figure  [ fig : tensor ] that the rotation of the electric field dominates at small scales compared to the interaction term",
    ". observations of cosmological magnetic fields are difficult enough as it is , a new cosmological observable would lead to better understanding of studies in magnetic fields .",
