    "some notable exceptions are concerned with relations between the geodesic period spectrum of a riemannian manifold all of whose geodesics are closed , henceforth called besse manifold , and its topology . for instance",
    "a conjecture of berger , stating that on a simply connected besse manifold all prime geodesics have the same length , was proved by gromoll and grove for @xmath1-spheres @xcite and recently by radeschi and wilking for all topological spheres of dimension at least @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "apart from spheres , which admit many besse metrics , i.e. riemannian metrics all of whose geodesics are closed , the only known besse manifolds are the other compact rank one symmetric spaces .",

    "for instance , berger s conjecture does not hold for spindle orbifolds @xcite , which admit many besse metrics ( cf . section [ sub : p - metrics_on_spindle ] ) . however , it turns out that there is still a relation between the geodesic period spectrum of a besse @xmath1-orbifold and its topology .",
    "in fact , we generalize the results of gromoll , grove and pries mentioned above in a unifying approach to the setting of riemannian @xmath1-orbifolds .",
    "we prove the following result .",
    "the geodesic period spectrum of a besse @xmath1-orbifold is determined up to a constant by its orbifold topology . in the manifold case",
    "all prime geodesics have the same length .",
    "the geodesic period spectrum of a besse 2-orbifold is by definition the set of lengths of all unoriented prime geodesics counted with multiplicity . in the manifold case",
    "the proofs by gromoll , grove and pries hinge on the existence of at least three simple closed geodesics , i.e. closed geodesics without self - intersections . using a connectedness argument they moreover show that all prime geodesics are simple . this observation combined with the blaschke conjecture for @xmath3 proved by green @xcite shows that a besse metric on the real projective plane has constant curvature @xcite . our proof is independent of the existence of simple closed geodesics . in the appendix we show how rigidity on the real projective plane can be deduced from our result based on a systolic inequality due to pu @xcite . the latter observation was explained to us by a. abbondandolo . in the appendix",
    "we moreover partially strengthen our result by showing that the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of a besse @xmath1-orbifold with isolated singularities can be conjugated by a contactomorphism to a standard geodesic flow .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . after reviewing some preliminaries and examples",

    "based on the above list we will be able to show that the geodesic period spectrum also only depends on the orbifold topology of a given besse 2-orbifold .",
    "the proof of the above list relies on the following ideas .",
    "the unit tangent bundle @xmath21 of a besse @xmath1-orbifold @xmath8 with isolated singularities is a manifold and the geodesic flow on it is periodic due to a result of epstein @xcite .",
    "we obtain two transversal seifert fiberings on @xmath22 , one from the geodesic flow and another one from the projection @xmath23 .",
    "properties of these seifert fiberings and their interplay imply the claim in many cases . for besse @xmath1-orbifolds with codimension one",

    "our proof shows that this assumption can be avoided ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that in general our result is a riemannian phenomenon that can not be seen from the hamiltonian point of view .",
