    "entanglement is an essential ingredient in quantum information and the central feature of quantum mechanics which distinguishes a quantum system from its classical counterpart . in recent years",
    ", it has been regarded as an important physical resource , and widely applied to a lot of quantum information processing(qip ) : quantum computation [ 1 ] , quantum cryptography [ 2 ] , quantum teleportation [ 3 ] , quantum dense coding [ 4 ] and so on .",
    "entanglement arises only if some subsystems ever interacted with the others among the whole multipartite system in physics , or only if the multipartite quantum state is not separable or factorable in mathematics .",
    "the latter provides a direct way to tell whether or not a given quantum state is entangled .    as to the separability of bipartite quantum states , partial entropy introduced by bennett _",
    "_ al_. [ 5 ] provides a good criterion of separability for pure states .",
    "later , wootters presents the remarkable concurrence for bipartite systems of qubits [ 6,7 ] . based on the motivation of generalizing the definition of concurrence to higher dimensional systems , many attempts have been made [ 8,9,10,11 ] , which provide good separability criteria  for bipartite qubit systems under corresponding conditions , whilst ref.[8 ] also presents an alternative method to minimize the convex hull for mixed states . as to multipartite quantum systems ,",
    "several separability criteria have been proposed [ 12,13,14,15,16,17 ] .",
    "the most notable one is 3-tangle for three qubits",
    "recently , the result has been generalized to the higher dimensional systems [ 18 ] . despite the enormous effort ,",
    "the separability of quantum states especially in higher dimensional systems is still an open problem .    in this paper",
    "we construct the full separability criteria for arbitrary tripartite qubit system by a novel method , i.e. a tripartite pure state can be defined by a three - order tensor .",
    "the definition provides an intuitionistic mathematical formulation for the full separability of pure states .",
    "analogous to ref.[8 ] , we extend the definition to mixed states .",
    "more importantly , our approach is easily generalized to higher dimensional systems . as applications ,",
    "we discuss separability of two bound entangled states introduced in [ 19,20 ] , respectively .",
    "we start with the separability definition of tripartite qubit pure state @xmath0 @xmath1 is fully separable iff @xmath2consider a general tripartite pure state written by@xmath3where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the coefficients @xmath8s can be arranged as a three - order tensor ( tensor cube ) [ 21 ] as shown in figure 1 .",
    "note that the subscripts of @xmath8 correspond to the basis @xmath9 .",
    "every surface can be regarded as the tensor product of a single qubit and an unnormalized bipartite state .",
    "hence , if the two vectors ( edges ) of a surface are linear relevant ( including one of the vectors is @xmath10 vector ) , then the bipartite state mentioned above can be factorized .",
    "the conclusion for diagonal plane is analogous .",
    "considering all the planes , one can easily find that the tripartite state is fully separable iff all the vectors which are parallel mutually shown in the cube , are linear relevant , according to the fundamental linear algebra .",
    "i.e. the rank of every matrix composed of four coefficients on the corresponding surface and diagonal plane is @xmath11 .",
    "equivalently , we can obtain the following lemma .",
    "* * lemma1.-**a tripartite pure state @xmath12 with the form of eq.(2 ) in @xmath13 dimensional hilbert space is fully separable , iff the following six equations hold : @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    * proof . *",
    "( sufficient condition ) if eq.(3)-eq.(5 ) hold , then the rank of every matrix that the cubic surface corresponds to is _",
    "one_. if eq.(6)-eq.(8 ) hold , then the rank of every matrix that the cubic diagonal plane corresponds to is _",
    "one_. hence , that eq.(3)-eq.(8 ) hold simultaneously shows that the tripartite pure state can be fully factorized , i.e. it is fully separable .",
    "( necessary condition ) if a given tripartite state is fully separable , one can easily obtain that the rank of every corresponding matrix is @xmath11 .",
    "namely , eq.(3)-eq.(8 ) hold .",
    "consider that @xmath22 can be denoted by a vector in @xmath13 dimensional hilbert space,@xmath23with the superscript @xmath24 denoting transpose , we can write the above equations ( 3 - 8 ) in matrix notation by@xmath25where the star denotes complex conjugation , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "( alternatively , @xmath39 can be replaced by @xmath40 for tripartite pure states of qubit with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , by which @xmath45 comlex optimal parameters can be reduced for the case of mixed states ) .",
    "define a new vector @xmath46 by @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49 , then the length of the vector can be given by @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the full separability criterion for a tripartite state can be expressed by a more rigorous form as follows .    * * theorem1.-**a tripartite pure state @xmath51 is fully separable iff @xmath52",
    ".    * proof . * that * *  * * @xmath53 is equivalent to that @xmath54 holds for any @xmath55 . according to lemma 1 , one can obtain that @xmath53 is the sufficient and necessary condition .",
    "a tripartite mixed state @xmath56 is fully separable iff there exists a decomposition @xmath57 , @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is fully separable for every @xmath60 or equivalently iff the infimum of the average @xmath61 vanishes , namely,@xmath62among all possible decompositions .",
    "therefore , for any a given decomposition @xmath63according to the minkowski inequality@xmath64one can get@xmath65consider the matrix notation [ 8 ] of equation ( 10 ) as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath68 , the columns of  the matrix @xmath69 correspond to the vectors @xmath59 , and the eigenvalue decomposition , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of @xmath56 , and @xmath72 is a unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of @xmath56 , associated with the relation @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a right - unitary matrix , inequality ( 12 ) can be rewritten as @xmath75 in terms of the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath76the inequality @xmath77is implied for any @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the infimum of equation ( 15 ) is given by @xmath82 analogous to ref.[8 ] , with @xmath83s are the singular values , in decreasing order , of the matrix @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is as well expressed by @xmath86one can easily see that @xmath87 provides a necessary and even sufficient condition of full separability for tripartite mixed qubit systems , hence an effective separability criterion",
    ". however , it is so unfortunate that @xmath85 can not serve as a good entanglement measure , but only an effective criterion to detect whether a state is fully separable , because @xmath46 for pure states is not invariant under local unitary transformations .",
    "at first , consider the complementary states to shifts  upb [ 19 ] .",
    "shifts  upb is the set of the following four product states@xmath88with @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding bound entangled ( complementary ) state is given by @xmath90with @xmath91 corresponding to the shifts  upb . in ref.[19 ] , it is stated that this complementary state has the curious property that not only is it two - way ppt , it  is also two - way separable . the numerical result based on our criterion",
    "can show a _",
    "non - zero _ ( @xmath92 ) entanglement for @xmath93 , which is consistent to [ 19 ] .",
    "let s consider the second example , the dr - cirac -tarrach states [ 20 ] @xmath94we can also show the @xmath95 @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98the conclusion is also implied in [ 20 ] .",
    "the above numerical tests are operated as follows . in order to show the nonzero @xmath99 with @xmath100 or @xmath101 , we choose @xmath102 random vectors @xmath103 generated by _",
    "matlab 6.5 _ for a given @xmath104 , then substitute these vectors into @xmath105 and obtain @xmath106 matrices .",
    "we can get @xmath102 ( @xmath107)s by singular value decomposition for the matrices .",
    "the maximal @xmath108 among the matrices is assigned to @xmath99 . due to the whole process",
    ", it is obvious that our numerical approach is more effective to test the _",
    "it can only provide a reference for the _ zero _ @xmath99 .",
    "if a standard numerical process is needed , we suggest that the approach introduced in ref.[17 ] be preferred .",
    "as a summary , we have shown effective criteria for tripartite qubit systems by the pioneering application of the approach to define a tripartite pure state as a three - order tensor . however , although our criteria can be reduced to wootters concurrence [ 7 ] for bipartite systems , as mentioned above , the criteria can not serve as a good entanglement measure . therefore , it is not necessary to find out the concrete value of @xmath85 , but whether @xmath110 are greater than @xmath10 , as can be found in our examples .",
    "based on the tensor treatment for a tripartite pure state , if a more suitable @xmath111 that can serve as a good entanglement measure can be found , it will be interesting .",
    "it deserves our attention that our approach can be easily extended to test the full separability of multipartite systems in arbitrary dimension , which will be given out in the forthcoming works .",
    "we would like to thank x. x. yi for extensive and valuable advice .",
    "we are grateful to the referees for their useful suggestion and comments .",
    "this work was supported by ministry of science and technology , china , under grant no.2100cca00700 .",
    "different from the previous definition of tensors , all the quantities with indices , such as @xmath112 , are called three - order tensors here . therefore , the set of all one - order tensor is the set of vectors , and the set of all two - order tensors is the set of matrices .",
    "three - order tensors @xmath112 are matrices correpsonding to the planes in the cube ( vectors corresponding to the edges ) when any one ( two ) of their three indices is ( are ) fixed ."
