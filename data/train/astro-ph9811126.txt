    "galaxy formation is one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "much effort has gone into the search for primeval galaxies ( hereafter pgs ) , i.e. galaxies undergoing their first major burst of star formation , at redshifts larger than @xmath42 .",
    "several objects have been put forward as possible pgs , ranging from high - redshift radio - galaxies to ly@xmath8 emitters ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; yee et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , most of these candidate pgs appear to already contain a substantial amount of heavy elements ( as indicated for example by the presence of p cygni profiles ) , implying previous star formation and metal enrichment .",
    "( @xmath8(1950 ) = 03@xmath935@xmath1015.2@xmath11 , @xmath12(1950 ) = @xmath13 ) is a relatively nearby blue compact dwarf galaxy ( hereafter bcd ) with an absolute magnitude m@xmath14= -16.7 and which appears to be undergoing its first burst of star formation . with a metallicity of only z@xmath15/41 ( izotov et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is the second most metal - deficient galaxy known , after i zw 18 ( z@xmath15/50 ) . with a redshift of 0.0136 and a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , it is at a distance of 54.3 mpc ( 1@xmath17=263 pc ) .",
    "thuan , izotov , & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) and @xcite have found that the stars in  are not older than @xmath4 100 myr , making it a truly young galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggest that the large hi envelope within which  is embedded may be truly primordial . yet , despite its youth and extremely low metallicity , hst images of  clearly show dust patches mixed in with the six super - star clusters where most of the star formation is occurring ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 ) . the presence of dust , in combination with the intense ultraviolet radiation field from the many young stars in suggests that there may be detectable mid - infrared ( mir ) emission , as the dust will reprocess the uv starlight and reemit it in the infrared .",
    "we have therefore obtained mir observations of  with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) to study the properties of dust and star formation in a truly metal - deficient environment , similar to those prevailing at the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "the observations were obtained with isocam ( cesarsky et al . , 1996a ) , the mir imaging instrument aboard iso ( kessler et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "they consist of two different sets : a set of broad - band filter maps , and a set obtained by imaging spectroscopy .",
    "the broad - band maps were obtained with a spatial sampling of 3@xmath18 per pixel and in a 3@xmath53 raster mode with a 3-pixel displacement in each direction , giving a total field of view of @xmath19 .",
    "the raster mode increases the sensitivity and improves the flat - field correction since in the center of the map , each sky position is imaged by 9 different camera pixels .",
    "the maps were obtained with the lw9 , lw10 , lw8 , lw6 and lw2 filters , centered respectively at 14.9 , 12.0 , 11.3 , 7.7 and 6.7  ( table  [ tbl : obslog ] ) .",
    "note that the lw10 filter is identical to the iras 12  filter .",
    "the integration time was 10.08s per readout for all filters , except lw10 for which an integration time of 5.04s was used .",
    "total on - source times were 860s for lw10 and 1540s for the other filters .",
    "imaging spectroscopy was performed using the circular variable filter ( cvf ) facility of isocam .",
    "this mode produces images of the full isocam field of view ( @xmath20 ) in the 2 - 17  wavelength region , with a sampling of 6@xmath18 per pixel and a spectral resolution @xmath21/@xmath22 of @xmath23 40 . due to the faintness of the source we obtained observations only in the 8.78 - 17.34wavelength range .",
    "the individual integration time was 5.04s and the total on - source time was 4800s .",
    "the various steps of isocam data reduction are detailed in @xcite and we will only describe here aspects that depart from the methods discussed in that paper : dark current subtraction and transient correction .",
    "the dark current is known to show secular trends which depend on the position of the satellite in its orbit and on the time elapsed since launch .",
    "these trends can be accurately modelled ( see biviano et al .",
    "1998 ) , allowing nominal dark subtraction .",
    "transient corrections using the inversion algorithm of abergel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) were applied successfully to the broad - band observations . for the cvf observations , the known oversimplification of the method combined with the intrinsic faintness of the source results in errors of similar magnitude for both corrected and uncorrected cvf data .",
    "the main effect of the correction is to add an artifact at the start of the spectrum ( around 17 ) while leaving the rest of the scan unchanged .",
    "in particular , synthesis of the lw8 and lw9 flux densities from corrected or uncorrected spectra gives flux densities 1.3 times larger than the observed broad - band flux densities . that the cvf produces higher flux densities than the broad - band filters is to be expected : the operational setup of isocam is such that the scan starts with a short exposure through the lw2 filter with a scale of 6@xmath18 per pixel , giving a much higher illumination on the detector than the scan itself . as the source is very faint , the detector would need a much longer time than our adopted exposure time to stabilize down to its true level .",
    "this is not the case for the broad - band maps as the broader filters allow many more photons to reach the detector , thus speeding the stabilization process . as a result , we have adopted for the remaining discussion the cvf spectrum uncorrected for transient effects and scaled down by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "figure 1 displays the spectral energy distribution of .",
    "the flat - fielding and photometry of the cvf scan were made following @xcite .",
    "conversion from camera units to mjy was performed using the calibration factors given in the _ isocam cookbook_. hst images ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 ) reveal that most of the star formation in  occurs within a region of @xmath42.5@xmath18 in size , so that the individual super - star clusters in  are not resolved by isocam .",
    "thus the flux densities given in table  [ tbl : obslog ] and plotted in figure 1 are integrated over the whole star - forming region .",
    "since the isocam lw10 filter is equivalent to the iras 12filter , it is interesting to see how the integrated properties of  compare with those of other bcds and irregular galaxies .",
    "we have thus compiled iras and h@xmath8 fluxes for the thuan & martin ( 1981 , hereafter tm81 ) catalog of bcds , as well as for the sample of bcds and irregular galaxies in sauvage , thuan , & vigroux ( 1990 ) to perform the comparison .    with a",
    "12  to blue luminosity ratio l@xmath24/l@xmath2 of 2.15@xmath250.06 ,  is comparable to the most mir - bright objects in the tm81 catalog . in that sample",
    "the mean l@xmath24/l@xmath2 ratio ( @xmath26logl@xmath24/l@xmath2@xmath27=-0.12@xmath250.27 ) , while already twice as high as that for spiral galaxies in the cfa catalog ( sauvage & thuan 1994 ) , is a factor of 3 smaller than the ratio for .",
    "this shows that even though the bcd is @xmath4 10 times more metal - poor than the galaxies in tm81 , it nevertheless contains a significant amount of dust heated by an intense uv radiation field .",
    "if we compare the 12  luminosity to a tracer of star formation such as the h@xmath8 luminosity ( table  [ tbl : data ] ) , appears to be normal .",
    "although total h@xmath8 fluxes are scarce for bcds , the available data give @xmath26logl@xmath24/l@xmath28@xmath27=0.96@xmath250.70 for the above samples , as compared to 0.65@xmath250.03 for .",
    "thus , even though the metallicity of the bcd is exceptionally low , and the galaxy unusually mir - bright , its star - forming properties appear to be normal when compared to other bcds .      when the mir spectral energy distribution of ( figure 1 ) is compared to mir spectra of other star - forming galaxies ( see e.g. metcalfe et al . 1996 ; vigroux 1997 ) , two facts stand out : ( 1 ) there is no emission from the so - called unidentified infrared bands ( hereafter uibs , usually attributed to carbon - based dust , see e.g. papoular et al .",
    "1996 ; puget & lger 1989 ) .",
    "in particular the very strong band at 11.3  is completely absent from the spectrum ; and ( 2 ) there are no evident fine structure ionic lines , even though neon as well as sulfur lines are usually quite bright in starburst galaxies .    in figure 1 , a hint of the [ siv]@xmath2110.5and [ neiii]@xmath2115.6  lines can be seen .",
    "there is a feature near the position of the [ neii]@xmath2112.8  line , but it is centered at 12.8 , while the redshifted line falls at 12.98 .",
    "the quality of our spectrum prevents us from actually measuring line fluxes .",
    "instead we compute upper limits as twice the local rms noise times the instrumental profile width at 20% of peak intensity at the line location .",
    "we obtain upper limits of 5.6@xmath510@xmath29ergs@xmath16@xmath30 for the [ siv ] line , 4.5@xmath510@xmath29ergs@xmath16@xmath30 for the [ neii ] line , and 5.4 @xmath510@xmath29ergs@xmath16@xmath30 for the [ neiii ] line .    using the photoionization models of @xcite with a metallicity equal to 0.02 that of the sun , and with an integrated h@xmath31 flux in  of 12.1@xmath32ergs@xmath16@xmath30 ( the flux given by izotov et al .",
    "1997 was multiplied by 4 to account for aperture and extinction effects as suggested by thuan & izotov 1997 ) , we predict the line intensities of [ siv ] , [ neiii ] , and [ neii ] to be 5.0@xmath510@xmath29 ergs@xmath16@xmath30 , 1.6@xmath510@xmath29ergs@xmath16@xmath30 , and 7.7@xmath510@xmath33ergs@xmath16@xmath30 respectively .",
    "the predicted intensities are thus completely consistent with the upper limits .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the weakness ( or absence ) of ionic fine - structure lines in  when compared to other star - forming galaxies can be explained by a very strong continuum which decreases the equivalent widths of the lines , making them difficult to detect .",
    "none of the usual uib features are seen , suggesting that their carbonaceous carriers are absent or have been destroyed .",
    "as the star - forming region , 660pc in diameter , contains 5000 equivalent o7 stars ( izotov et al .",
    "1997 ) , the average energy density is @xmath3410ev@xmath35 .",
    "@xcite suggest that at this radiation density , the abundance of the band - emitting dust is reduced by a factor of @xmath410 .",
    "therefore the absence of the bands can be understood as a destruction effect .",
    "this is probably enhanced by the very low metallicity of the galaxy which allows harder uv photons to travel further into the interstellar medium .",
    "the origin of the continuum emission is more problematic .",
    "we observe what could be interpreted as either a broad emission feature at around 14 , or a broad absorption feature at @xmath3616 .",
    "we favor the second hypothesis as we know of no candidate which would show such an emission feature at @xmath4 14 .",
    "very small carbonaceous grains , usually thought to be responsible for the mir continuum ( dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) , produce featureless emission .",
    "silicates , the other well - known component of dust , can produce emission features of various shapes , but these are centered around 10 and even in circumstellar disks never extend beyond 12  ( see e.g. sitko et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand , silicate extinction bands at 9.7 and 18  can provide an explanation for the strange shape of the mir spectrum of .    testing",
    "this hypothesis is not straightforward as the expected shape of the dust spectrum in this wavelength range is difficult to constrain .",
    "apart from the stochastic heating of macromolecules which produce the uibs , mir emission is thought to be produced by very small grains in a thermal regime intermediate between equilibrium and stochastic heating ( see e.g. dsert et al .",
    "we have therefore attempted to fit the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of  with different screen models where the emission spectrum was successively : ( 1 ) a black - body of variable temperature modified by an emissivity law of the form f@xmath37@xmath8b@xmath37(t)@xmath38 ; ( 2 ) a power - law spectrum ; and ( 3 ) the continuum mir spectrum of the galactic hii region m17 with uibs and ionic lines removed ( cesarsky et al .",
    "the free parameters of the underlying spectra include in all cases a scaling factor , in addition to the temperature in case ( 1 ) and the power - law slope in case ( 2 ) .",
    "a further uncertainty comes from the extinction curve to be used .",
    "we have tried two different laws , the standard mir extinction law derived by @xcite , and that observed in the direction of the galactic center by @xcite .",
    "the second law differs from the first by its much higher a@xmath39/a@xmath40 in the range 2 - 8 .",
    "this difference is probably due to the neglect of ice coating on grains in the @xcite model .",
    "the free parameter associated with the extinction curve is simply the absolute extinction at a reference wavelength . our fitting procedure searches for best fits to the cvf scan data only .",
    "there is no attempt to fit the broad - band data outside of the cvf range .",
    "however , a successful model will be one that also accurately predicts them .",
    "figure 2 shows examples of the three types of fits .",
    "both a power law and the m17 spectrum fail to reproduce the observed sed .",
    "power laws modified by extinction overproduce emission shortward of 8  ( figure 2a ) while the m17 spectrum overestimates emission longward of 14  ( figure 2b ) . on the contrary ,",
    "a black - body spectrum modified by an emissivity law proportional to @xmath41 and extinguished by a screen of dust , gives an excellent fit to the sed of  ( figure 2c ) .",
    "the goodness of the fit depends very little on the exponent of the emissivity law , so its value can not be used to constrain the nature of the emitting dust .",
    "instead , the fit is sensitive to the shape of the extinction law .",
    "it is impossible to obtain a good fit for the lw2 and lw6 bands with the standard extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "the predicted spectrum always overproduce the emission in these bands by factors of @xmath42 . on the contrary ,",
    "excellent fits of these bands can be obtained with the @xcite extinction curve .",
    "the temperature obtained for the black - body curve is in the range 240 - 260 k , but probably carries little physical meaning since the mir - emitting grains are not likely to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the information we derive concerning the dust extinction is more physical . given the uncertainties in our data",
    ", we obtain an equivalent a@xmath40 of 19 - 21 mag . note",
    "that since the screen model maximizes a@xmath40 for a given column density of dust , the column density derived from our fit is likely a lower limit to the true column density if emitting and absorbing dust grains are mixed .",
    "such a high value of extinction is in sharp contrast to the values ( a@xmath40 @xmath42 0.6 mag ) derived by @xcite from optical spectrophotometric observations .",
    "the large difference between the optical and infrared extinctions implies that the heating sources responsible for the infrared emission detected by iso are probably too deeply embedded in dust to be detected in the visible and that , as in the case of the antennae galaxies ngc4038/39 ( mirabel et al . 1998 ) , most of the infrared emission is powered by invisible star clusters .",
    "indeed , correcting the h@xmath8 flux for 20mag of visible extinction would lead to unrealistically high star formation rates which would be incompatible with the non - detection of  at 1.4ghz by the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , or in the far - infrared by iras .",
    "the lw10 luminosity of 2.5@xmath510@xmath43l@xmath0 is equivalent to the bolometric luminosity of 2500o7 stars , i.e. half the equivalent number of stars in the visible super - star clusters .",
    "given that in the bcd sample of tm81 , @xmath26logl@xmath24/l@xmath44@xmath27=-0.85@xmath45 , it is probable that in fact some 18000 equivalent o7 stars are required to power the total infrared emission .",
    "this implies that even in very low - metallicity environments such as those characterizing pgs , a significant fraction , i.e. @xmath4 3/4 , of the total star formation activity of a galaxy can be effectively hidden from uv / optical observations .    from the extinction derived in the mir",
    ", we can estimate the dust mass . as mir extinction is essentially due to silicates ( draine & lee 1984 )",
    ", this result will likely be a lower limit as some carbon - based dust ( such as the grains responsible for the continuum ) can be present and still contribute little extinction in the mir . using the dust model of @xcite , we obtain a dust surface density of 1.5 m@xmath0pc@xmath46 . to derive a dust mass , we need to estimate lower and upper bounds to the dust spatial extent . for a lower bound , we assume that the dust is only associated with hidden super - star clusters ( sscs ) .",
    "oconnell , gallagher , & hunter ( 1994 ) found that sscs typically have a very compact core with a half - light radius of @xmath43pc , embedded in considerably more extended halos with diameters @xmath430pc .",
    "if we adopt the latter value , and consider that at least 3 sscs are hidden ( they have the power of 2500 equivalent o7 stars needed to power the lw10 luminosity ) , we derive a dust mass of @xmath43.2@xmath510@xmath47m@xmath0 .",
    "this is very probably an underestimate of the true dust mass as there are likely many more hidden sscs .",
    "furthermore dust is probably not just associated with the sscs , but rather mixed throughout the star - forming region , especially if it has a supernova origin as argued later on .",
    "a likely upper limit to the spatial extent of the dust is the size of the region where reddening is observed by hst ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e. 660pc .",
    "this gives a dust mass of 5@xmath510@xmath7m@xmath0 . with the  mass given in table  [ tbl : data ] ,",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio of  is then between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , i.e. much higher than in the galaxy , which is not too surprising for such a low metallicity object ( lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "more extraordinary is the fact that the dust mass in  can be of the same order of magnitude as that in bcds which are on average @xmath4 10 times more metal - rich . for comparison @xmath26logm@xmath50@xmath27=4.4@xmath250.6m@xmath0 in the tm81 bcd sample .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , because stars in  are not older than @xmath4100 myr , there is not enough time for the silicate dust to be made in the envelopes of red giant stars .",
    "rather silicate grains probably condensed out of the numerous supernova ejecta present in the bcd ( see e.g. @xcite on sn1987a ; dwek et al .",
    "1992 ; wooden et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we can check for the plausibility of this hypothesis by adopting , for example , the supernova silicate dust mass input rate of 0.5m@xmath0pc@xmath46gyr@xmath16 obtained by @xcite for the galactic center at 0.1gyr , the age of .",
    "assuming the diameter of the dust - forming region to be 660pc , we derive a silicate dust mass of @xmath42@xmath510@xmath51m@xmath0 , in the range of the above estimates .",
    "although  is one of the most metal - deficient galaxies known ( @xmath52/41 ) , it is unexpectedly bright in the mir range , implying a silicate dust mass in the range 10@xmath4710@xmath53 m@xmath15 .",
    "the mir spectrum shows no sign of uib carriers which are probably destroyed . despite a difference of a factor of 40 in metallicity",
    ", the galactic center mir extinction produces the best fit to the spectrum .",
    "this is quite different from the situation in the uv where the extinction law shows a strong dependence on metallicity ( fitzpatrick 1989 ) .",
    "this difference is probably due to the fact that the abundance and spectral properties of the carbon - based dust responsible for the uv extinction and uibs are more metallicity - dependent than those of the silicate grains responsible for the extinction in the mir .",
    "a possible explanation is that the silicate grains are more resistant to photo - destruction than carbon - based dust .",
    "the derived extinction is quite high , a@xmath54@xmath420 mag . given that the total mir luminosity already requires the bolometric luminosity of 50% more young stars than are seen in the galaxy , the total star formation rate ( sfr ) as derived from the optical or uv luminosities must underestimate the true star formation rate by at least 50% , and more likely by a factor of 4 as argued above .",
    "thus if  is a representative example of pgs , the cosmic star formation rate will be systematically underestimated if based only on uv and optical fluxes .",
    "this is in fact the result obtained by @xcite in their iso survey of distant galaxies .",
    "they found that the cosmic sfr derived from fir luminosities is @xmath4 2 to 3 times higher than the sfr estimated previously from uv / optical fluxes ( madau et al .",
