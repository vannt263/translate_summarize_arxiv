    "very often an involved physical concept can be better understood in terms of its opposite .",
    "polarization is a pertinent example : perhaps the most sensible way to look at it is to explore unpolarized states , as one can make sense of them using exclusively invariance principles , a tool of paramount importance in physics .",
    "the constitution of unpolarized light was investigated from the very beginning of modern optics .",
    "indeed , already stokes  @xcite and verdet  @xcite offered a lucid characterization of what they called `` natural '' light by using the projections of the intensity onto the axes of a rotated cartesian coordinate system .",
    "unpolarized states are those that remain invariant under any rotation of that coordinate system and under any phase shift between its rectangular components .    in classical optics , the field components of unpolarized light",
    "are well modeled by zero - mean , uncorrelated , stationary gaussian random process  @xcite .",
    "the previous invariance conditions thus determine the entire probabilistic structure of the projected intensities  @xcite .",
    "however , as the standard theory is limited to first - order moments , unpolarized light is presented as having zero - mean stokes vector , which in geometrical terms means that it is just the origin of the poincar sphere  @xcite .",
    "we stress , though , that this is an incomplete characterization , for it safely overlooks higher - order moments  @xcite .    at the quantum level ,",
    "the invariance requirement fixes once and for all the structure of the density matrix , as first pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite : unpolarized states are maximally mixed in each subspace with a given number of photons  @xcite . to put it in another way , it specifies the probability distribution and , as a result , all the moments of the stokes variables .",
    "nowadays , there is a widespread belief that a thorough appreciation of the subtle effects arising in he quantum world requires a careful scrutiny of higher - order polarization fluctuations .",
    "we have been advocating the use of a hierarchy of correlation functions that take into account the successive moments of the stokes variables  @xcite . the most systematic way to accomplish",
    "this is by expanding the density matrix in multipoles  @xcite .",
    "the idea of unpolarized states can be directly translated in this scenario : when all the multipoles up to a given order ( say @xmath0 ) vanish , the state lacks of polarization information up to that order and hence will be called @xmath0th - order unpolarized .",
    "the classical picture matches the first - order theory , whereas the quantum condition implies that all the multipoles are identically null .",
    "our goal here is to explore the _ terra incognita _ between these two extreme cases . in this respect ,",
    "we mention that , as we shall see , this is closely related with the so - called _ hidden _ polarization , introduced by klychko  @xcite .    our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : polstr ] we concisely sketch the fundamentals needed to grasp the polarization hallmarks of quantum fields and introduce the multipoles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : korder ] we revisit unpolarized states from the viewpoint of these multipoles , defining @xmath0th unpolarized states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we apply the formalism to some illuminating examples and , finally , our conclusions are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "a satisfactory description of the polarization structure of quantum fields is of utmost significance for our purposes .",
    "this is precisely the objective of this section .",
    "let us consider a monochromatic field specified by two operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 , representing the complex amplitudes in two linearly polarized orthogonal modes , we indicate as horizontal ( @xmath3 ) and vertical ( @xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "the stokes operators are  @xcite @xmath5 together with the total photon number @xmath6 the superscript @xmath7 stands for the hermitian adjoint . in this schwinger representation",
    "@xcite , these operators differ by a factor 1/2 from the common stokes parameters  @xcite , but in this way the components of the stokes vector @xmath8 satisfy the commutation relations of the su(2 ) algebra : @xmath9 = i { \\hat{s}}_{z } \\ , , \\ ] ] and cyclic permutations ( we use @xmath10 throughout ) .",
    "the noncommutability of these operators precludes the simultaneous sharp measurement of the corresponding quantities . among other consequences",
    ", this implies that no field state ( apart from the two - mode vacuum ) can have definite nonfluctuating values of all the stokes operators simultaneously .",
    "this is quantified by the uncertainty relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the variances . in this vein",
    ", one can say that the electric vector of a monochromatic quantum field never describes a definite ellipse .    moreover",
    ", while the stokes operators are all hermitian , the noncommutability makes mixed , nonsymmetric products ( such as @xmath13 ) non - hermitian , also precluding their direct measurement .    in classical optics , the total intensity is a well - defined quantity and the poincar sphere appears then as a smooth surface with radius equal to that intensity . in contradistinction , in quantum optics we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 plays the role of the spin ( @xmath16 being the photon number ) . as fluctuations in @xmath16",
    "are unavoidable ( leaving aside photon - number states ) , we are forced to talk of a three - dimensional poincar space ( with axis @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) that can be envisioned as a set of nested spheres with radii proportional to the different photon numbers that contribute significantly to the state .",
    "we next make the important observation that @xmath20 = 0 \\ , .\\ ] ] this expresses in the quantum language the fact that polarization and intensity are separate concepts : the form of the ellipse described by the electric field ( polarization ) does not depend on its size ( intensity ) .",
    "this fact brings about remarkable simplifications .",
    "first , it means that each subspace with a fixed number of photons must be handled separately .",
    "equivalently , in the previous onion - like picture of the poincar space , each shell has to be addressed independently .",
    "this can be emphasized if instead of the fock states @xmath21 , which are an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space of these two - mode fields , we employ the relabeling @xmath22 which can be seen as the common eigenstates of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for each fixed @xmath25",
    ", @xmath26 runs from @xmath27 to @xmath25 and these states span a @xmath28-dimensional invariant subspace , wherein the operators @xmath29 act in the standard form @xmath30    second , from it follows that any function of the stokes operators @xmath31 commutes with @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath33 ( which describes the state ) connecting subspaces with different values of @xmath25 do not contribute to @xmath34 .",
    "put differently , the only accessible polarization information from any state @xmath33 is its block - diagonal form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the photon - number distribution ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 is the reduced density matrix in the subspace with spin @xmath25 .",
    "this @xmath39 has been termed the polarization sector  @xcite or the polarization density matrix  @xcite .",
    "what matters for our purposes is that any @xmath33 and its associated @xmath40 can not be distinguished in polarization measurements and , accordingly , we shall be using the block - diagonal form and drop henceforth the subscript pol .      instead of using",
    "directly the states @xmath41 , it is more convenient to expand each component @xmath42 in as @xmath43 the irreducible tensor operators @xmath44 are  @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the clebsch - gordan coefficients that couple a spin @xmath25 and a spin @xmath0 to a total spin @xmath25 .",
    "these tensors are an orthonormal basis @xmath47 =    \\delta_{s s^{\\prime } }   \\delta_{k   k^{\\prime } } \\delta_{q q^{\\prime } } \\ , , \\ ] ] and they have the right transformation properties : under a rotation parametrized by the euler angles @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 where the @xmath50 stands for the matrix elements of the rotation operator @xmath51 in the basis @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "although at first sight they might look a bit intimidating , they are nothing but the multipoles used in atomic physics  @xcite . after some calculations",
    ", one can recast eq .   as @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 is the anticommutator . in consequence , we conclude that @xmath56 can be related to the @xmath0th power of the stokes operators  ( [ eq : stokop ] ) .",
    "the corresponding expansion coefficients @xmath57\\ ] ] are known as state multipoles .",
    "the hermiticity imposes the symmetry condition @xmath58 and the positive semidefiniteness of @xmath42 forces the bound @xmath59 for every @xmath60 and @xmath61 a positive constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 is just the strength of the @xmath0th multipole in the state @xmath42 .    finally , we turn to the important class of axially symmetric states  @xcite . they are invariant under rotations about an axis that we take as the @xmath63 axis .",
    "since @xmath64 , this implies @xmath65 thus , they are characterized exclusively by the multipole components @xmath66 . any density operator that can be obtained from @xmath67 via an su(2 )",
    "transformation , represents as well an axial symmetric state , as a rotation only change the direction of the symmetry axis of the state .",
    "some axially symmetric systems are also invariant under the reversal of the symmetry axis ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) .",
    "as this corresponds to a rotation around the @xmath69 axis by an angle @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we get from @xmath72 so only multipoles of even rank @xmath0 contribute .",
    "from now on , we restrict ourselves to a single component @xmath42 ( i.e. , a fixed number of photons ) .",
    "this is by no means a restriction , as the discussion can be extended in a natural way to the complete polarization density matrix in .",
    "the full polarization information is encoded in the complete multipole distribution @xmath73 . however , for most of the states , only a limited number of multipoles play a substantive role and the rest of them have a small contribution . as a consequence ,",
    "gaining a good feeling of the corresponding behavior may be tricky .",
    "a way to bypass this disadvantage is to look at the cumulative distribution @xmath74 please , note carefully that the monopolar term has been excluded , as it is trivially isotropic for all the states .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 conveys whole information _ up _ to order @xmath0 . we know from probability that it has remarkable properties  @xcite",
    ".    to get extra insights into this subject , let us focus , for the time being , on the key example of su(2 ) coherent states ( also known as spin or atomic coherent states ) , which can be written down as the superposition  @xcite @xmath76 with coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the polar and azimuthal angles on the sphere , respectively . if @xmath80 is the unit vector in the direction  @xmath81 , the operator @xmath82 is the observable measured in polarization experiments  @xcite : coherent states can be alternatively interpreted as eigenstates of @xmath83 @xmath84 whence one can confirm that hey saturate the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : unrel ] ) and so they are the minimum uncertainty states in polarization optics .    for these states",
    ", one can immediately find @xmath85^{2}}{\\gamma ( 2s - k ) \\gamma ( 2s + k + 2 ) } \\ , .\\ ] ] as conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is the maximal value attainable for any @xmath0 in each subspace @xmath25 .",
    "this nicely corroborates the amazing properties of su(2 ) coherent states : they are maximally polarized states to any order , as one would expect from a pure state that corresponds as nearly as possible to a classical spin vector pointing in a given direction .",
    "this maximal property suggests at once a hierarchy of degrees of polarization @xmath86 which sort the relevant polarization information _ up _ to order @xmath0  ( @xmath87 ) . the experimental reconstruction reported in ref .",
    "@xcite reveals that by performing a stokes measurement in @xmath88 independent directions , one can actually determine @xmath75 and hence all the degrees @xmath89 .",
    "we will say that a state is @xmath0th - order unpolarized when @xmath90 ( which obviously implies @xmath91 ; i.e. , all the multipoles up to order @xmath0 vanish ) and we will denote these states as @xmath92 .",
    "note , though , that @xmath0th - order unpolarized states do carry polarization information when one looks at higher - order moments .",
    "this is referred to as _ hidden _ polarization , according to the terminology coined by klyshko  @xcite , albeit it would be better to say that such states display higher - order polarization  @xcite .    in more physical terms",
    ", the condition of @xmath0th - order unpolarization amounts to imposing that the moments @xmath93 are independent of the direction @xmath80 for @xmath94 ( i.e. , they are isotropic ) .",
    "therefore , all the moments up to order @xmath0 do not show any angular structure , whereas higher - order ones do .",
    "notice , in passing , that this is the logic beyond the recent proposal of anti - coherent states  @xcite : such states `` point nowhere '' ( to a given order ) , and this is certainly one way to serve as the opposite of a state that points , as much as possible , somewhere .",
    "from this perspective , these unpolarized states are exhibits the most nonclassical features  @xcite .    for the particular case of the dipole ( @xmath95 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pk ] ) reduces to @xmath96 which coincides with the standard definition  @xcite .",

    "this goes to the classical notion of random states , as it involves exclusively first - order moments .",
    "when the state is unpolarized to any order , only the monopole contributes : @xmath99 so it is a random state within each invariant subspace .",

    "single - photon states ( @xmath101 ) are fairly special : they can only be first - order unpolarized . the multipole expansion of a general single - photon state reads @xmath102",
