    "@xcite found that the decline in @xmath3-band magnitude within 15 days after @xmath3 maximum , @xmath6 , correlates inversely with the @xmath3-band maximum luminosity @xmath7 and thus can be used as a luminosity indicator .",
    "thus , sne ia can be used as distance indicators in cosmological studies ( `` standard candles '' ) .",

    "@xcite showed that the ratio of the depths of two si  ii  lines ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) at @xmath3-band maximum , @xmath2(si  ii ) , is larger for dimmer sne , and suggested that this is due to temperature differences .",

    "we introduce our method and quantities important in this context .",
    "the reference wavelength of a fd , @xmath52 , is blueshifted with respect to the rest frame wavelength @xmath58 , because absorption occurs in material moving towards the observer . therefore , as seen from the observer s point of view , the processes relevant for a particular fd take place within a thin layer where the atoms have a line - of - sight ( ray - parallel ) velocity @xmath59 . in the narrow - line limit ( sobolev approximation ) , with @xmath60 , this zone is an infinitely thin `` iso-@xmath61 plane '' perpendicular to the ray .",

    "this is denoted by angle brackets `` @xmath62 '' below .",
    "the weight of each shell is determined by the number of photons impinging on the absorption surfaces of the multiplet within the shell .",

    "the total fraction of photons absorbed ( `` absorption fraction '' @xmath65 ) , which is expected to correspond to fd values , can then be calculated as :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the sobolev optical depth for line @xmath68 in shell @xmath69 , defined as    @xmath70    here , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the number density of ions in the lower and upper level of the line , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , and @xmath15 is the time from explosion .",

    "the offset between the exact values of fd and the absorption fraction , which increases somewhat towards the dim end , is discussed in appendix [ app : data - em ] .",

    "[ fig : si6355-abs ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this is due to saturation : because si  ii  @xmath1 has large optical depths ( middle panel ) , the absorption fraction ( bottom panel ) approaches unity , and it varies only weakly ( @xmath95 for large @xmath96 ) .",
    "measured fds show a shallow trend , as do absorption fractions .",
    "the fd values indicate , however , an additional amount of residual flux .",
    "again , we show in appendix [ app : data - em ] that 50% of this amount is due to the p - cygni emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that the evolution of si  ii  @xmath8 is due to a contribution of ti  ii  lines in dim sne .",
    "however , this possibility can be ruled out reviewing the list of active lines .",
    "in order for ti  ii  lines to make a significant contribution , the ti abundances must increase by a factor of @xmath97 in our sn  1999by model .",
    "this however leads to exceedingly large strengths for many other ti lines ( fig .",

    "@xmath54 does not yet show an increase , also because si  ii  @xmath0 gets weaker due to the slightly modified temperature structure .",
    "the larger ti abundance leads , however , to an unrealistic opacity increase below @xmath98.,width=317 ]",
    "having clarified the behaviour of observed fd values , we now briefly discuss the use of line strengths and ratios as luminosity indicators . we have shown that fd(si",
    "ii@xmath8 ) correlates with luminosity and drives @xmath10(si  ii ) .",
    "fd(si  ii  @xmath8 ) itself ( or similarly the equivalent width ew , as measured in ) should be the most direct and meaningful luminosity indicator .",
    "there are , however , uncertainties even in fd(si  ii  @xmath8 ) as a spectroscopic luminosity indicator .",
    "first , the trend in the line is due to the combination of trends that are nonlinear in temperature , luminosity and also in @xmath6  in the relevant ranges ( see sec . [",
    "sec : data - abs ] ) . in order",
    "to obtain luminosities from spectra , one has to choose an appropriate functional form ( e.g. linear or second order ) to fit the relation between feature strength and luminosity .",
    "inaccuracies introduced by the use of such a functional form can easily be overlooked or misinterpreted as scatter .",
    "second , intrinsic variations in the sne and their spectra limit the precision of spectroscopic luminosity indicators .",
    "differences in the abundance distributions among equally luminous sne [ see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ] are a possible reason for this ( see also below , sec . [",
    "sec : siphysics ] ) .",
    "one way to reduce the error would be to use a number of spectroscopic luminosity indicators .",
    "even quantities which are theoretically more elusive than fd may be useful , because different indicators respond differently to spectral peculiarities .",
    "besides ratios like @xmath2(si  ii ) , ew is also worth considering , because it accounts better for absorption in the line wings .",
    "sne for which spectroscopic luminosity determination is unreliable could be identified if different indicators gave inconsistent luminosities .",
    "the accuracy of spectroscopic luminosity determination could be improved if additional luminosity indicators were found that rely on species other than si  ii .",
    "a number of such quantities has already been defined ( @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the validity of these potential luminosity indicators still needs to be critically assessed in terms of the physical differences among sne with different luminosities @xcite .",
    "the si  ii  @xmath8 optical depths , absorption fractions and fds are quite tightly correlated .",
    "the line thus reflects the physics in the si - dominated layers of most sne ia much better than si  ii@xmath9 .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the si  ii  @xmath8 profiles in @xmath3 max .",
    "spectra of several sne with similar luminosity and explore the differences .",
    "if the si distribution peaks in the zone with the largest si  ii  ionisation fraction , one may expect relatively large fds . on the other hand , a smeared - out si distribution , or one with several peaks might cause an unusually shallow feature , as observed in sn  2006x [ @xcite , @xcite ( in prep . ) ] .",
    "going one step further , it would be interesting to infer the distribution of si using stratified abundance models @xcite .",
    "this would be especially valuable in the context of sn ia theory ( see @xcite ) and explosion physics .      apart from si  ii  @xmath8 and @xmath9 , other features in photospheric spectra of sne ia seem to evolve with luminosity .",
    "the si  ii@xmath99 line behaves similar to si  ii  @xmath0 @xcite , and the s  ii  trough is strongest for sne with intermediate luminosity . in appendix [ app : otherfeatures ] , these two features are investigated .",
    "based on a sequence of 25 synthetic spectra constructed to fit sne ia with different luminosities , we have been able to explain the @xmath100si  ii@xmath101 relation .",
    "the increasing strength of si  ii  @xmath8 is responsible for the increase of @xmath100si  ii@xmath102 from luminous to dim objects .",
    "this is in turn due to ionisation : in dimmer sne , si  ii  @xmath8 is stronger because the si  iifraction increases more strongly than than the level occupation numbers decline . in contrast , si  ii  @xmath9 is saturated because of its large optical depths .",
    "thus , the line has a rather constant strength and only a minor influence on @xmath100si  ii@xmath102 .",
    "an investigation as performed here shows how observed line strengths can be related to sn physics .",
    "si  ii  @xmath8 probably provides the most reliable information about the si layer in optical spectra .",

    "second , the estimated pseudo - continuum may deviate from the flux behind the absorption surfaces , as seen from the observer .    to trace these effects ,",
    "we counted photon packets representing different components of the residual flux in our simulations and recorded the pseudo - continuum estimate for each fd measurement .      the residual flux at a measurement wavelength @xmath52 can be split into contributions of different origin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : line ] ) .    one contribution ( `` penetrating flux '' @xmath107 ) directly depends on the absorption fraction @xmath65 .",
    "it consists of photons crossing the multiplet s absorption surfaces without being absorbed , and is approximately given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( `` effective continuum '' ) is the flux impinging on the absorption surfaces of the multiplet , multiplied by a correction factor .",
    "this factor , usually a bit smaller than unity , accounts for the fact that photons passing the absorption surface do not have a 100% chance of escaping the envelope .",
    "the rest of the residual flux ( `` emission '' @xmath110 ) consists of photons which have been shifted to an observer - frame wavelength @xmath111 at the absorption surfaces ( corresponding to @xmath52 ) or even closer to the observer . in the following",

    "the amount of p - cygni emission will generally correlate with the absorption strength .",
    "the flux of photons that were reprocessed into an observer - frame wavelength @xmath111 ( for example in line processes ) at depths closer to the observer will be called `` additional reprocessed flux '' ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "all fluxes are given relative to the pseudo - continuum .",
    "the penetrating flux @xmath115 and the emitted flux @xmath116 can be added up on the left scale to obtain a prediction for the residual flux ( not explicitly shown ) .",
    "this coincides roughly with the measured residual flux ( grey curve ) .",
    "the grey curve represents the fractional depth with units on the _ right hand side_.,width=325 ]    for si  ii  @xmath8 , emission causes a moderate offset between penetrating flux and measured residual flux @xmath117 ( fig .",

    "about half of the emission ( triangles / dark , dotted line ) is p - cygni emission , which increases with decreasing luminosity .",
    "the additional reprocessed flux , in turn , is relatively constant ( not explicitly shown ) , as is @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the measured fds correlate well with the absorption fractions .",
    "still , the offset between fds and absorption fractions has a practical consequence : it makes the relative decrease in fd from intermediate to very luminous sne larger , increasing the influence of si  ii  @xmath8 on @xmath2(si  ii ) .      ; plot analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : si5972-em].,width=325 ]    intuitively , the residual flux in the saturated si  ii  @xmath9 line should be lower than observed .",

    "both these contributions and @xmath114 are practically constant within the luminosity sequence .      for the two lines determining @xmath2(si  ii ) , @xmath114 is constantly @xmath118 and the additional reprocessed flux is small ( @xmath119 of the residual flux ) . even under slightly different simulation conditions , we expect fds to correlate well with the absorption in their respective lines , because redwards of si  ii   @xmath8 , the number of lines which might cause deviations is relatively small .",
