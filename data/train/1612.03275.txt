    "the spectrum of sn  1998bw was dereddened with @xmath77 , while that of sn  1997ef needs no absorption correction .",
    "all spectra were smoothed with a boxcar of 50  .",
    "the absorption lines of sn  1998bw are significantly broader than those of iptf15dld , while those of sn  1997ef represent a better match . ]     compared with that of sn  2003jd ( red ) at comparable rest - frame phase , dereddened with @xmath78 .",
    "all spectra were smoothed with a boxcar of 50  . ]",
    "the light curve of iptf15dld resembles that of normal , narrow - lined type ic sne , with sn  2007gr ( hunter et al . 2009 ) providing an excellent match ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snlcs ] ) .",
    "however , the photospheric absorption lines are broad , so this is classified as a broad - lined ic sn , rather similar to well - monitored broad - lined sne ic at comparable epochs after light maximum ( sne 1997ef , 2002ap , 2003jd , 2004aw ) .",
    "since spectra were taken only starting 20 days after maximum , we can not make an assessment of the photospheric velocity before and around maximum ; similarly , the photometric information does not allow us to construct a pseudo - bolometric light curve covering the epoch of maximum luminosity . as a consequence , our estimates of the physical parameters are only approximated .    in absence of synthetic light curve and spectra based on a detailed radiative transfer model obtained from observed quantities ,",
    "the basic sn physical parameters can be derived by rescaling those of other well studied sne using the fundamental relationships of @xcite , as done for instance in @xcite .",
    "however , iptf15dld lacks an estimate of both its light curve width , @xmath79 , and its photospheric velocity at maximum luminosity , @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , our estimate of its kinetic energy and ejecta mass can only be based on an average of these parameters for the five sne that provide the best light curve and spectral match ( see section [ res : spectra ] ) .    from the physical parameters estimated for sne 1997ef , 2002ap , 2003jd , 2004aw and 2007gr ,",
    "@xcite we derive ranges of [ 1 - 18 ] @xmath81 erg and [ 2 - 10 ] m@xmath2 for the kinetic energy and ejecta mass of iptf15dld , respectively .",
    "since the shape and luminosity of the bolometric light curve suggest that iptf15dld could have been similar to sn  2007gr or up to a factor of 2 more luminous at peak , we accordingly estimate that the mass of radioactive @xmath1ni synthesized in the explosion may be in the interval [ 0.08 - 0.2 ] m@xmath2 .",
    "these values are consistent with a progenitor of main sequence mass of the order of @xmath320 - 25 m@xmath2 .",
    "a dedicated accurate model is not completely justified by the limited quality of these data .",
    "broad - lined ic sne of modest luminosity are a rather uncommon and poorly known class , and have started to be detected in larger numbers thanks to dedicated surveys .",
    "as grb sne , that are significantly more massive and luminous , they may be partially powered by an inner engine , i.e. an unusual type of remnant , like a magnetar or a black hole .",
    "the prototype of this sub - class is sn  2002ap @xcite , for which evidence had been found of a small fraction of ejected material accelerated to velocities larger than 30000 km  s@xmath5 . since these objects have low ejecta mass ( their synthesized @xmath1ni mass is small ) , the total kinetic energy is also not extremely large ( @xmath82 erg ) , but the high photospheric velocities suggest a powerful engine . whether these are the progenitors of grbs that are misaligned with respect to the line of sight and therefore go undetected , or they represent a population of intermediate properties between classical , narrow - lined sne ic and grb sne , is matter of controversy @xcite .",
    "clarification of this issue ( e.g. , through late - epoch radio observations , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may lead to a simplification of the apparent diversity of stripped - envelope sne .",
    "we note that the opposite , i.e. low photospheric velocities in highly luminous sne are never observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the case of iptf15dld shows how optical surveys that cover large areas of the sky with good cadence using classical facilities can improve dramatically the study of a broad range of transients .",
