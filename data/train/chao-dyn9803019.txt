    "many - particle systems can show collective behavior when the average kinetic energy is small enough .",
    "this collective macroscopic behavior can coexist with chaos at the microscopic level .",
    "such a behavior is particularly evident for systems that have a phase transition , for which a nonvanishing order parameter measures the degree of macroscopic organization , while at the microscopic level chaotic motion is a source of disorder .",
    "the latter can induce non trivial time dependence in the macroscopic quantities , and it would be desirable to relate the time behavior of such quantities and their fluctuations to the chaotic properties of microscopic motion , measured through the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "a naive idea is that an increase of chaos as the energy ( temperature ) is increased should be accompanied with a growth of fluctuations of some macroscopic quantity . these should be maximal at the critical point and then drop again at high energy . in this paper",
    "we study a model of @xmath0 fully - coupled hamiltonian rotators which realizes such a behavior , it has been called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model  @xcite .",
    "it can also be considered as a system of interacting particles moving on a circle .",
    "this system has a second order phase transition and in the ordered phase the rotators are clustered ; the high temperature phase is a gaseous one , with the particles uniformly distributed on the circle .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the maximal lyapunov exponent grows up to the critical energy density @xmath2 and then drop to zero in the whole high temperature phase in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "correspondingly one observes a growth of kinetic energy fluctuations up to the critical point and then a phase of vanishing fluctuations .",
    "finite @xmath0 effects complicate this simple picture . in the high temperature phase",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent vanishes quite slowly ( with @xmath3 ) and finite size effects influence the first region below the critical point . in this region",
    "the system displays metastability : starting far from equilibrium , this is reached in a time @xmath4 which grows with @xmath0 .",
    "on the contrary , the extremely low energy phase is characterized by a weak @xmath0 dependence , with the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath5 which behaves as @xmath6 .",
    "although the model is extremely simplified , it shares many features with more complex models , for which the relation between chaotic motion at the microscopic level and collective macroscopic properties has been studied .",
    "let us mention studies in solid state physics and lattice field theory  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been actually in nuclear physics  @xcite , where there is presently a lively debate on multifragmentation phase transition  @xcite , that the interest in the connection between chaos and phase transitions has been revived . in this case in fact , an energy / temperature relation quite close to the hmf model has been observed  @xcite and critical exponents have been measured experimentally  @xcite .",
    "statistical thermodynamical models  @xcite and percolation approaches  @xcite have been proved to give a good description of the experimental data , though the dynamics is missing . on the other hand classical molecular dynamics models @xcite seem to contain all the main ingredients , but have the disadvantage that a detailed understanding of the dynamics can be too complicated . in this respect",
    ", the hmf model can be very useful in clarifying some general dynamical features which could be eventually compared with real experimental data .",
    "in fact , when studying nuclear multifragmentation , one deals with excited clusters of 100 - 200 particles interacting via long - range ( nuclear and coulomb ) forces .",
    "quantum effects are relevant only at very low energy .",
    "in fact in the nuclear case , at very low energy , @xmath7 is not linear in @xmath8 , but grows as @xmath9 because nucleons are fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , a classical picture should be quite realistic in the critical region where the excitation energy is substantial  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present new numerical data concerning both statistical quantities , like specific heat and distribution functions , and chaotic probes , like lyapunov spectra and kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "moreover , we add to the theoretical analysis of the model a thorough treatment of differences in the fluctuating quantities between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles .",
    "we also investigate in detail the relaxation to equilibrium and compare numerical results with a complete self - consistent vlasov calculation of distribution functions .",
    "finally a comparison of numerically obtained maximal lyapunov exponents with theoretical formulas is attempted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly discuss the details of the hmf model . the equilibrium statistical mechanics and the continuum vlasov solution",
    "are described in sects . 3 and 4 respectively .",

    "the model describes the motion of n rotators characterized by the angle @xmath12 : each rotator interacts with all the others .",
    "one can define a spin vector associated with each rotator @xmath13 the hamiltonian then describes n classical spins similarly to the xy model , and a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic behavior according to the positive or negative sign of @xmath14  @xcite . in the following",

    "@xcite , and analytically in ref .  @xcite using a riemaniann geometry approach  @xcite .",
    "the connection between lyapunov instability and thermodynamical properties has been established in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the original proposal of the hmf",
    "@xcite , the relation of the model with self - gravitating systems ( in the attractive case ) and charged sheets models ( in the repulsive case ) was studied ; this has been also taken over for the gravitational case in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the context of plasma models  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the hmf is the peculiar representative of a larger class of models , whose thermodynamics can be solved exactly  @xcite . moreover , anomalous diffusion properties of a generalization of the model , with two angles for each rotator , have been recently studied  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to look at the predictions of statistical mechanics .",
    "we restrict here to the @xmath1 limit , where microcanonical and canonical ensemble results coincide for averaged quantities ( apart from exceptions near first order phase transitions , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the free energy of our model can be easily obtained in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite and the result reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( the boltzmann constant @xmath28 is set to 1 ) and @xmath29 is the modified bessel function of @xmath30-th order .",
    "the auxiliary variable @xmath31 is introduced to decouple the particles by the usual hubbard - stratonovich trick for gaussian integrals , and the search of the maximum in eq .",

    "it vanishes for @xmath34 , the inverse critical temperature . at low temperatures it approaches @xmath35 ( the limit of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the energy - temperature relation ( sometimes called the _ caloric curve _ ) is @xmath37 thus @xmath38 .",

    "thus for what concerns the critical behavior , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .    these theoretical results are compared with those of numerical simulations in fig .  1 , where care is taken to use almost equilibrated initial data in order to reduce the relaxation time ( as discussed in sects . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we have integrated eqs .",
    "( [ eqmoto ] ) using fourth order symplectic algorithms  @xcite with a time step @xmath48 , adjusted to maintain the error in energy conservation below @xmath49 .",
    "the agreement is good over the whole energy range and finite n effects , although present , are weak .    in the inset of fig .",
    "1b we plot the results obtained starting from non equilibrated initial data ( the  water bag \" initial condition discussed in sect . 5 ) and",
    "although the integration time was quite long ( @xmath50 ) , a sharp disagreement is observed just below the critical point .",
    "a region of negative specific heat is present and a continuation of the high temperature phase ( linear @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 relation ) into the low temperature one ( metastability ) .",
    "it is very intriguing that these out - of - equilibrium quasi - stationary states ( qss ) show a caloric curve very similar to the one found for first order phase transitions  @xcite . in that case",
    ", however , the corresponding states are equilibrated and do not die asymptotically , as it is shown in sec .  5 for our qss .",
    "in our case , at equilibrium , we do not have phase - coexistence , all rotators belong to a single cluster ( see sec .",
    "4 ) ; phase - coexistence can arise only as a finite @xmath0 non - equilibrium effect .",
    "the existence of long - living non - equilibrium states has been noticed already in refs .",
    "@xcite and a connection to critical slowing down has also been proposed .",
    "more recently it has also been found numerically in other one - dimensional models  @xcite and in self - gravitating systems  @xcite , but in this case it is not associated to the closeness of a phase transition .",
    "the coexistence of different states in the continuum limit near the critical point is a purely microcanonical effect .",
    "it arises because of the inversion of the @xmath51 limit with the @xmath1 one .",
    "concerning fluctuations , it is well known that the predictions of microcanonical ensemble differ from those of the canonical  @xcite .",
    "for instance , while in the canonical ensemble kinetic energy fluctuations are given by @xmath52 their expression in the microcanonical ensemble is  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( for a rigorous definition of microcanonical temperature see  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is compared with numerical simulations in fig .  5b .",
    "the specific heat is  @xcite @xmath55 and also compares quite well with numerical simulations ( see fig .",
    "5c ) ; although finite @xmath0 effects are obviously stronger for fluctuations than for the averages .",
    "the vlasov equation for our system reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the normalized distribution function and the potential @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath58 a simple hypothesis that can be made on the distribution function @xmath59 is that it factorizes as @xmath60    although simple , this is a very strong hypothesis and its validity can at present be justified only by the correctness of the results which are derived thereby ( see the following ) . in the high temperature phase one expects a uniform distribution in @xmath61 and then @xmath59 should depend only on @xmath62 , this fact is then consistent with the factorization hypothesis .",
    "lowering the temperature below the transition point , a modulation in @xmath61 appears .",
    "this is a manifestation of the jeans instability ( see ref .",
    "if the modulation is not too strong , the factorization hypothesis is again reasonable .",
    "however , in the low temperature / energy phase this hypothesis has no clear _ a priori _ justification .    by further requiring that @xmath63 is gaussian @xmath64 one gets the equation @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "restricting to the stationary solution , @xmath68 one can easily solve for @xmath69 @xmath70 = g_0 \\exp \\left [ \\frac{m}{t } \\cos ( \\theta - \\phi ) \\right]~ , \\label{g}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 as imposed by normalization and @xmath25 is the phase of @xmath72 .",
    "it must be observed that @xmath73 is expressed in terms of @xmath74 or @xmath75 , which are themselves functions of @xmath73 ; so one must solve the problem self - consistently , after writing the equations for the two components of the magnetization @xmath76 these equations coincide exactly with the consistency equations ( [ cons ] ) of the solution in the canonical ensemble .",
    "once @xmath74 are determined by solving ( numerically ) eqs .",
    "( [ cons1],[cons2 ] ) , they can be substituted back into eq.([g ] ) , thus obtaining the stationary distribution function .",

    "( [ cons1],[cons2 ] ) . with respect to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite we have fully determined the distribution function by imposing the self - consistency conditions through eqs .",
    "( [ cons2 ] ) .    in the high temperature phase @xmath77",
    "thus @xmath78 is uniform .    at very low temperature one can use the asymptotic development of @xmath79 @xmath80\\ ] ] to get the gaussian @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the variance , which vanishes with @xmath7 , giving a dirac-@xmath83 at zero temperature .",
    "a comparison of formulas ( [ gaussian],[g ] ) with numerical data is shown in fig .  2 ; the theoretical curve fits the data very accurately with no free parameter . both in the low energy region ( fig .",
    "2a , b ) and at higher energy , where the cluster drifts ( fig .",
    "2c , d ) , the agreement is very good",
    ". the theory does not determine the value of @xmath25 , which remains arbitrary ; so we have adjusted this value to the center of the cluster , which is moving in time quite irregularly .",
    "around the critical energy , relaxation to equilibrium depends in a very sensitive way on the adopted initial condition  @xcite .",
    "when starting with `` water bag '' initial conditions , i.e. a flat distribution function of finite width centered around zero for @xmath84 , and putting all rotators at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , we reveal the presence of quasi - stationary ( long living ) non - equilibrium states ( qss ) ( see the inset of fig .",
    "1b ) . in fig .",
    "3 the evolution to equilibrium of the qss state is shown by the time evolution of the reduced distribution function @xmath87 .",
    "it is only at @xmath88 that a good reproduction of the gaussian distribution and a convergence to the predicted equilibrium temperature @xmath89 for @xmath90 is obtained for @xmath91 .",
    "such a slow relaxation is observed in the region just below the critical point ( see fig .",
    "1b ) and also around @xmath92 .",
    "in order to study the @xmath0-dependence of the relaxation time @xmath4 we have roughly quantified the distance from the equilibrium state by measuring @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the boltzmann entropy of the momentum reduced distribution function , and @xmath95 its equilibrium value when the distribution is a gaussian at the given equilibrium temperature @xmath96 .",
    "the results , shown in fig .",
    "4 , clearly indicate an increase of the relaxation time with @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , which can be approximately fitted with a linear law @xmath97 .",

    "@xcite analysing the time needed to absorb holes in the momentum distribution ( so called dupree structures in plasma physics ) for the antiferromagnetic hmf .",
    "it then seems that various indicators agree in suggesting a diverging time scale with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the time scale also depends on @xmath8 , and what we have here found is that it is much greater in the region near the critical point .",
    "this could be a manifestation of critical slowing down .",
    "we have computed the lyapunov spectrum @xmath100 by the standard method of ref .",

    "5(a ) we plot @xmath5 as a function of @xmath8 for various @xmath0 values . as the system is integrable both in the limit of very small and very large energies ( reducing in the former case to weakly coupled harmonic oscillators and in the latter to free rotators )",
    ", the maximal lyapunov exponent must vanish in these two limits .    in the region of weak chaos , for @xmath102",
    ", the curve has a weak @xmath0-dependence .",

    "a similar regime was found in ref .",
    "@xcite and this behavior is also similar to the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite at a solid - liquid transition . in this region of strong chaoticity we observe a pronounced peak already for @xmath105  @xcite , which persists and becomes broader for @xmath106 .    the standard deviation @xmath107 of the kinetic energy fluctuations is plotted in fig .",
    "5(b ) and it compares quite well with the theoretical prediction ( [ fluct ] ) , although finite @xmath0 effects are larger than for averaged quantities . in fig .",
    "5(c ) we report the microcanonical specific heat obtained with formula  ( [ verlet ] ) , compared with numerical simulations at increasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "both these quantities display a similar behavior to the maximal lyapunov exponent : they increase up to the critical point and then drop to zero .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to associate the growth of the lyapunov exponent to the growth of fluctuations , as expressed both by the kinetic energy fluctuations and the specific heat . in this respect",
    "a similar connection was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , a theoretical formula for the lyapunov exponent as @xmath1 does not yet exist ( see anyway next section ) ; however , the data in fig .",
    "5(a ) already show what we should expect for the convergence of @xmath5 as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath108 , @xmath109 as @xmath1 , thus revealing the presence of a whole region of integrability in this limit ; rotators decouple , reducing the system to a  gas \" of free rotators ( which is consistent also with the vanishing of kinetic energy fluctuations ) .",
    "6(a ) shows that the convergence to zero can by fitted as @xmath110 .",
    "this scaling law can be derived theoretically using a random matrix approximation  @xcite ( see also next section ) , which is also shown in the same figure to approximate quite well the numerical results at large enough energy .",
    "( a @xmath3 convergence to the asymptotic value of the lyapunov exponent is also observed in systems of hard spheres @xcite ) .",
    "the question is still open whether @xmath5 will show a discontinuity at @xmath2 in the @xmath1 limit , as the kinetic energy fluctuations and specific heat do .",
    "strong finite size effects are present in the region @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "this is the region where the cluster drifts ( see  @xcite ) , while particles evaporate from and condensate on it .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is here significantly larger than at smaller energies . for @xmath112",
    ", we observe a fast convergence to the @xmath1 limit , and the scaling law @xmath6 is numerically obtained ( see fig .",
    "a heuristic justification of this scaling was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a new derivation is presented in sec .",
    "the extensivity of the lyapunov spectrum was first proposed by ruelle  @xcite and numerically tested in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it amounts to check that plotting @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 and letting @xmath0 go to infinity , while keeping fixed physically intensive parameters ( in our case energy density or temperature ) , one obtains a convergence to an asymptotic curve , so called distribution of lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is verified for our model in fig .",
    "7(a ) at various energy densities .",
    "the asymptotic lyapunov distribution is more quickly reached , as @xmath0 increases , at smaller energies ( confirming the fast @xmath0 convergence observed above for the maximal lyapunov exponent at small energy ) .",
    "the data at @xmath115 show a much weaker convergence to the asymptotic spectrum , as also confirmed by looking at the kolmogorov - sinai entropy density at the same value of @xmath8 ( upper points in the inset of fig",
    "heavier numerical simulations are needed to assess the convergence of the spectrum in this energy region .",
    "the spectra have a curious exponential shape in the first part ( see the inset of fig .",
    "7(a ) ) , which was already noticed in ref .",
    "no significative change in the shape of the spectra at @xmath116 and @xmath105 is observed when going from below to above the phase transition point ( see fig .",
    "7(b ) for the @xmath105 case ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude that differences in the spectra could arise at larger values of @xmath0 , which are so far inaccessible to numerical experiments .    the kolmogorov - sinai ( k - s ) entropy density ( which , due to pesin s formula , is in our case the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents divided by @xmath0 ) , @xmath117 , is plotted in fig .  8 against @xmath8 .",
    "it shows again a peak at @xmath2 , a fast convergence to a limiting value as @xmath0 increases in the small energy limit and a slow convergence to zero ( as expected ) for @xmath118 .",
    "the scaling laws are here roughly : @xmath119 at small @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "9(a ) , and @xmath120 for @xmath121 , see fig .",
    "9(b ) ( but a more refined numerical analysis is needed to confirm these results ) .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the behavior of the lyapunov spectrum and of the k - s entropy confirms the picture already emerging from the study of the maximal lyapunov exponent , showing an increase of microscopic chaos near the phase transition point .",
    "it is somewhat intriguing that it is precisely when chaos is stronger that one reveals a slowing down of the relaxation to equilibrium ( see sec .",
    "5 ) ; although not unexpected , because it is quite symplistic to associate the notion of chaos to that of efficient diffusion of orbits in phase space .",
    "when starting from a  water bag \" initial condition one reaches the almost frozen qss state , and also for this state the transient lyapunov exponent has been checked to be positive , although slightly different than the asymptotic value in the equilibrium state .",
    "it could be that the phase space near the transition point has a rich structure with many coexisting chaotic qss states .",
    "in this section we discuss some theoretical approaches which allow to justify the scaling laws of the maximal lyapunov exponent observed in numerical experiments , and also to obtain some order of magnitude estimates .",
    "one can try to use the stationary vlasov distribution function ( [ gaussian],[g ] ) to derive some properties of the tangent space .",
    "for instance , averaging the jacobian @xmath122 ( [ der1],[der2 ] ) over this distribution , one obtains a constant matrix whose diagonal and off - diagonal elements are @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively ( we are here also neglecting correlations among the particles ) .",
    "it is then quite easy , being now the jacobian a constant matrix , to compute the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "the result is @xmath125 with lyapunov eigenvector @xmath126 , the vectors @xmath127 and @xmath128 being constant .",
    "this formula has the correct dependence on @xmath41 , in fact at small energies the virial relation @xmath129 holds and then @xmath130 , giving @xmath6 , which is what is observed numerically .",
    "however , formula ( [ lyap - vlasov ] ) predicts that the lyapunov exponent vanishes with @xmath99 , which is not observed in numerical experiments .",
    "we have found numerically that , even if we allow for the true temporal fluctuations of @xmath131 , we obtain for the lyapunov exponent the same value of formula ( [ lyap - vlasov ] ) and the same lyapunov eigenvector . on the contrary , if we look at the lyapunov eigenvector given by the true dynamics , we observe that it is far from being constant , only a few components being significantly different from zero .",
    "we have checked that the number of nonvanishing components of the lyapunov eigenvector remains constant as @xmath0 increases ( this has also been recently found also for a generalization of the hmf studied in ref .",
    "thus , the typical size of each component of the vector remains constant as @xmath0 grows ( remember that eigenvectors are normalized ) , while for constant eigenvectors this size decreases as @xmath99 ; this is a naive argument that can explain the extra @xmath99 present in formula ( [ lyap - vlasov ] ) with respect to what is observed for the true lyapunov , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "we have recently developed a perturbation theory scheme , which shows that for sparse eigenvectors @xmath5 does not vanish with @xmath0 at small energies and , with some additional hypotheses , one obtains the @xmath9 law  @xcite .",
    "we compare in this subsection a recently proposed formula for the maximal lyapunov exponent  @xcite with numerical results , giving also an intuitive interpretation of it for our model . in ref .",
    "@xcite a general method is formulated to describe hamiltonian chaos using the differential geometric structure underlying the dynamics .",
    "they consider the hamiltonian many - body dynamics as a geodesic flow on a riemannian manifold ; then the chaotic motion reflects the instabilities of the geodesic flow , which depend on the curvature properties of the manifold .",
    "they obtain the following formula for @xmath5 @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the average ricci curvature and the variance of its fluctuations respectively . for the hmf , these two quantities turn out to be given by very simple expressions in terms of the averages and fluctuations introduced in sec .  3",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the variance of the fluctuations of @xmath131 .",
    "all this is the consequence of the fact that the ricci curvature,@xmath137 with @xmath138 given by formula ( [ der1 ] ) , is simply given in our model by @xmath139 .",
    "the ricci curvature is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite to be a @xmath83-correlated stochastic process in time , and the correlation time @xmath140 in formula ( [ casettiformula ] ) is estimated as @xmath141 some comments about the derivation and the use of formula ( [ casettiformula ] ) are very important .",
    "it is derived in the  diagonal \" approximation , which corresponds to neglect the effect of off - diagonal terms ( [ der2 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) .",
    "this approximation has been checked numerically not to be valid at small energies , leading to a value of @xmath5 which is orders of magnitude less than the true one ( see also fig .",

    "we think that , in this limit , the stochastic approximation for the average ricci curvature breaks down , because this quantity is in our case nothing but @xmath131 , and this is an almost regularly oscillating quantity as @xmath150 , due to the collective excitations of the cluster .",

    "we have investigated the dynamical and statistical behavior of a system with long - range forces showing a second order phase transition .",
    "both the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath5 and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy density @xmath117 are peaked at the phase transition point , where kinetic energy fluctuations and specific heat are maximal .",
    "there is actually a small shift to lower energies due to finite size effects .",
    "the latter are present also in the lyapunov spectra and in the kolmogorov - sinai entropy . above the phase transition point , both @xmath5 and @xmath152 vanish as @xmath1 .",
    "we think that this toy model contains some important ingredients to understand the behavior of macroscopic order parameters when dynamical chaos is present at the microscopic level .",
    "most of our findings are probably common to other hamiltonian systems showing second order phase transitions . in particular",
