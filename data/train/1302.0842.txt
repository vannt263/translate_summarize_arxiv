    "the origin of these luminous , high - redshift sources is still under debate due , in part , to the low angular resolution at ( sub-)millmetre wavelengths of current instruments and the relative faintness of likely counterparts .",

    "* ) that emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) may also be a crucial component to the energetic output of smgs .    the likely connection between starburst and agn activity in smgs is further supported by the concurrent nature of the cosmic sfr and black hole accretion with peaks at @xmath62 ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of smg formation in a merger - driven scenario also suggest that the smg phase precedes rapid growth of a central agn @xcite .",

    "one should be cautious , however , in extrapolating the starburst - agn connection to the most extreme objects ( i.e. radio - loud agn , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) though such cases are a fundamentally different population of sources .",
    "unfortunately , while there are a multitude of methods for studying agn and star formation , disentangling their relative contributions to a galaxy s bolometric output remains challenging . obtaining redshifts and other information via optical / ultra - violet imaging and spectroscopy is exceptionally difficult as smgs are both distant and optically thick ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "ir spectroscopy of smgs typically show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features associated with star - forming regions , although there are cases of power - law - like spectra indicative of agn @xcite .",
    "arguably , the best indicator for agn activity is hard x - rays ( @xmath112 kev ) , which penetrate obscuring dust up to the compton thick limit ( neutral hydrogen column densities of n@xmath1210@xmath13 ) .",
    "x - ray detections are not uniquely attributable to agn , however , as high sfrs may produce numerous high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) that mimic the emission of low - luminosity agns .    in the past decade",
    "there have been few studies that consider x - ray counterparts to smgs for evidence of agn activity , though this number has expanded in recent years .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter a05a , b ) provide the earliest analysis by examining the _ chandra _ counterparts to scuba @xcite 850@xmath14 m identified sources in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) north field . in their sample of 20 smgs with radio and spectroscopic redshift identifications taken from @xcite , they find that @xmath075 percent have x - ray properties consistent with obscured ( n@xmath1210@xmath15 ) agn activity .",

    "we then detail our method for identifying x - ray counterparts to the aztec sources and subsequent multi - wavelength counterparts .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray - identified aztec sources follows a two - pronged approach : ( 1 ) applying x - ray spectral models and sed templates to the x - ray spectra and near - ir - to - radio sed , which will provide the basic information concerning the contribution of agn and star formation in each wavelength regime ; and ( 2 ) linking the x - ray spectral fits to the near - ir - to - radio sed modeling , thus providing greater insight into the agn / star formation connection . our sed fitting differs from typical sed analyses ( e.g. @xcite ) in that we employ a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) technique .",

    "this detection method uses a wavelet analysis of the input images ( in this case , the final merged x - ray images for each field ) followed by a sliding - box map detection and maximum likelihood analysis for both source centroiding and optimal photometry . during the source detection , the x - ray maps are divided into different energy bands ( i.e. 0.5 - 8.0 kev full band , 0.5 - 2.0 kev soft band and 2.0 - 8.0 kev hard band ) , resulting in a source catalog that includes all sources found in each energy band along with their respective count rates and positional uncertainties .",
    "the source detection process also produces a list of source regions , which are defined as circular regions with radius equal to twice the 90 percent energy encircled fraction ( defined according to the psf at the source position ) .",

    "the agns typically appear obscured in the x - ray band , with neutral hydrogen column densities in excess of @xmath3 .",
    "these results are consistent with other smg / x - ray studies .",

    "we suggest that this missing dust could result from radiation- and/or momentum - driven outflows caused by the starburst / agn regions , which pushes the dust out into the halo where it cools rapidly and , although it accounts for a small fraction of the total dust mass , may contribute significantly to the 1.1 mm emission .",
    "the high agn identification rate in these aztec smgs is particularly interesting in regards to smg formation and evolution scenarios . following a merger - driven scenario",
    ", the x - ray identified sources could represent the transitional period between starburst and agn dominant phases .",
    "however , the lack of a significant correlation at large scales between all x - ray sources and smgs in these fields suggests that not all smgs will evolve to possess an agn and , similarly , that not all agn evolve from a sub - mm bright phase .",
    "this suggests heterogeneity in the formation / evolution of smgs , possibly due to either intrinsic source properties , i.e. amount of obscuration , or even multiple formation scenarios . with future analyses aimed at source evolution as a function of redshift , combined with a more comprehensive redshift catalog for smgs ( one of the goals for the upcoming lmt )",

    "<S> do we find an x - ray - derived sfr consistent with nir - to - radio sed derived sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the x - ray luminosities as a prior to the nir - to - radio sed effectively sets the agn luminosity and sfr , preventing significant contribution from the agn template . </S>",
    "<S> our sed modeling further shows that the agn and starburst templates typically lack the required 1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations , arguing for an extended , cool dust component . </S>",
    "<S> the cross correlation function between the full samples of x - ray sources and smgs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlation between the two populations at large scales , suggesting that smgs and agns do not necessarily trace the same underlying large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the remaining x - ray - dim smgs , this suggests that sub - mm bright sources may evolve along multiple tracks , with x - ray - detected smgs representing transitionary objects between periods of high star formation and agn activity while x - ray - faint smgs represent a brief starburst phase of more normal galaxies .    </S>",
