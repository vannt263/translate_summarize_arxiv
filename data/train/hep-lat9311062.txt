    "a lattice regularization of the standard model ( sm ) is necessary not only to establish the existence of chiral gauge theories outside perturbation theory , but also to understand various properties of the fermion mass generation by spontaneous symmetry breaking such as , for instance , the upper bounds on top and higgs masses@xcite . for this purpose it is sufficient to study the fermion - scalar sector of the sm which is essentially a chiral yukawa model ( cym ) .    in this talk",
    ", we determine the phase structure of a @xmath0 cym , using zaragoza fermions@xcite .",
    "we decided to freeze the radial mode of the scalar field .",
    "this corresponds to the choice of an infinite bare quartic coupling . for a comparison with the phase structure of other related models see@xcite",
    "consider @xmath1 @xmath2 fermion doublets @xmath3 , and a @xmath4 @xmath2 matrix , @xmath5 .",
    "the action can be cast into the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lattice action for a scalar with frozen radial modes .",
    "@xmath8 , the free fermionic action is @xmath9 and the interaction term is @xmath10 our way of implementing the decoupling of doublers is based on the use of the @xmath11 fields . in momentum space ,",
    "@xmath12 in coordinate space this corresponds to an average of fields @xmath3 over an elementary hypercube @xmath13    the model has a global chiral @xmath0 symmetry @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "( a corresponding transformation acts on the barred fermions ) .",
    "the model has been constructed to show decoupling at tree level .",
    "the fermion - scalar vertex is given by @xmath16 and the particular choice of @xmath17 makes it vanish for every doubler fermion ( any @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) .",
    "it can also be shown that at any order in perturbation theory , the renormalized green functions are the same as the continuum ones .",
    "the proof@xcite is based on the riesz power counting theorem .",
    "there are also ( @xmath20 ) golterman - petcher like symmetries@xcite which can be used to argue that the doubler fermions also decouple in the nonperturbative regime , provided a sensible continuum limit exists .",
    "an important characteristic of our decoupling method is that the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters ( which describe the radiative corrections to the electroweak interaction observables coming from the higgs sector ) do not receive , at one loop level , contributions from the counterterms needed to recover gauge invariance@xcite .",
    "this allows us , using only the scalar - fermion sector of the sm , to compute @xmath23 non - perturbatively .",
    "prior to do this and the computation of upper bounds on top and higgs masses a phase diagram is required .",
    "we have performed an analytic calculation of the phase diagram , using mean field techniques , both for small and large values of the yukawa coupling @xmath24 .",
    "there are two essential steps .",
    "@xmath25 first . with the aid of two auxiliary scalar fields , one performs the integration over the scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath25@xmath25 for small @xmath24 , one expands @xmath26 arround 1 , up to four fermion terms before integrating out the scalar field .",
    "@xmath25@xmath25 for large @xmath24 , auxiliary fermions @xmath27 are used in order to change the coupling parameter to @xmath28 . in particular , for one fermion doublet , @xmath29 exp \\left\\ { \\overline\\eta{\\widehat{\\psi}}+{\\widehat{{\\overline\\psi}}}\\eta\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 one can now perform an expansion of the exponential around 1 , up to four fermion terms , then integrate out the scalar field .",
    "finally one integrates over the auxiliary @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath25 second . after replacing the auxiliary fields with their saddle point solutions",
    "one is able to calculate ( in both regimes ) the fermion determinant and therefore the free energy .",
    "= 7.4 cm    the order parameters we have used to distinguish the phases are @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "there are four phases :    @xmath25 fm : in this phase @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath25 pm : here , @xmath36 .    @xmath25",
    "af : this phase is characterized by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath25 fi : both parameters are different from zero .",
    "the mean field results are presented in figures [ full ] and [ numerical ] , where the range of validity for both small and large @xmath24 expansions can be appreciated ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively ) . for small @xmath24 the expected fm  pm",
    " afm structure appears together with a quadruple point and a fi phase . for large @xmath24",
    "only two phases appear , fm and fi , so that the shape of funnel is excluded for this model .",
    "the phase transitions are second order within this mean field approach . in the same approach",
    ", we can understand why the pm - af transition line is almost flat .",
    "this is a consequence of the decoupling .",
    "in fact , in the af phase , the scalar field takes the form @xmath41 , thus it always carries momentum @xmath42 . due to momentum conservation ,",
    "when this scalar interacts with two fermions , the latter must be either a physical fermion and a doubler or two different doublers . in either case , the interaction is supressed as doublers are decoupled .",
    "so , the critical hopping parameter @xmath43 is not affected by the yukawa coupling @xmath24 .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed by the montecarlo results ( figure [ numerical ] ) .",
    "the mean field calculation gives us a feeling for the phase diagram , but in order to have quantitative results we are doing a numerical simulation of this model with two doublets of fermions , using a hybrid - montecarlo algorithm .",
    "figure [ numerical ] shows some preliminary results for a @xmath44 lattice .",
    "they are in good agreement with the mean field computations .",
    "current work includes a montecarlo simulation in a @xmath45 lattice . using this larger lattice",
    "we expect first to get a clearer determination of the phase transition lines , second to calculate upper bounds on top and higgs masses , and third to study non - perturbatively the @xmath23 parameter .",
