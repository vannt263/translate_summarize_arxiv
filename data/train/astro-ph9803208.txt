    "the structure of the dark matter halos of galaxies provides important clues to their formation and dynamical evolution ( e.g. sackett 1996 ; de zeeuw 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "for example , in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario ( e.g. ostriker 1993 ) there is evidence that the density profiles of halos have a universal form essentially independent of the halo mass or @xmath12 ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; though see moore et al .",
    "the intrinsic shapes of cdm halos are oblate - triaxial with ellipticities similar to the optical isophotes of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. dubinski 1994 ) . the global shape of a halo also has implications for the mass of a central black hole ( e.g. merritt & quinlan 1997 ) .",
    "at present accurate constraints on the intrinsic shapes and density profiles of early - type galaxies are not widely available ( e.g. sackett 1996 ; olling & merrifield 1997 ) . stellar dynamical analyses that have incorporated the information contained in high order moments of stellar velocity profiles",
    "have made important progress in limiting the uncertainty in the radial distribution of gravitating mass arising from velocity dispersion anisotropy ( rix et al .",
    "1997 ; gerhard et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , as indicated by the paucity of such stellar dynamical measurements , the required observations to obtain precise constraints at radii larger than @xmath13 are extensive , and the modeling techniques to recover the phase - space distribution function are complex .",
    "it is also unclear whether this method can provide interesting constraints on the intrinsic shapes since only weak limits on the range of possible shapes have been obtained from analysis of velocity profiles out to @xmath14 @xmath15 ( e.g. statler 1994 ) .",
    "interesting measurements of the ellipticity of the gravitating mass have been obtained for two polar ring galaxies ( sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; sackett & pogge 1995 ) and from statistical averaging of known gravitational lenses ( e.g. keeton , kochanek , & falco 1997 ) , but owing to the rarity of these objects it is possible that the structures of their halos are not representative of most early - type galaxies",
    ". moreover , gravitational lenses , which are biased towards the most massive galaxies , only give relatively crude constraints on the ellipticity and radial mass distribution for any individual system and only on scales similar to the einstein radius ( e.g. kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from hot gas in isolated early - type galaxies ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ; for a review see sarazin 1997 ) probably affords the best means for measuring the shapes and radial mass distributions in these systems ( for a review see buote & canizares 1997b ; also see schechter 1987 and the original application to the analogous problem of the shapes of galaxy clusters by binney & strimple 1978 ) .",
    "the isotropic pressure tensor of the hot gas in early - type galaxies greatly simplifies measurement of the mass distribution over stellar dynamical methods .",
    "moreover , since the shape of the volume x - ray emission traces the shape of the gravitational potential independent of the ( typically uncertain ) gas temperature profile ( buote & canizares 1994 , 1996a ) , the shape of the mass distribution can be accurately measured in a way that is quite robust to the possible complicating effects of multi - phase cooling flows and magnetic fields ( see buote & canizares 1997b ) .    presently , x - ray measurements of the mass distributions in early - type galaxies are inhibited by limitations in the available data .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "@xcite position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) @xcite has inadequate spatial resolution ( psf @xmath16 fwhm ) to map the detailed mass distributions for all but the largest nearby galaxies , and the limited spectral resolution and band width complicates interpretation of the measured temperature profiles ( buote & canizares 1994 ; trinchieri et al . 1994 ; buote & fabian 1997 ) . although equipped with superior spatial resolution ( psf @xmath17 fwhm ) , the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) @xcite has too small an effective area and too large an internal background to provide images of sufficient quality for many galaxies for radii @xmath18 . among the few galaxies with detailed measurements of their radial mass profiles",
    "are ngc 507 ( kim & fabbiano 1995 ) , ngc 1399 ( rangarajan et al . 1995 ; jones et al .",
    "1997 ) , ngc 4472 ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ) , ngc 4636 ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1994 ) , ngc 4649 @xcite , and ngc 5044 ( david et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the shape of the gravitating mass has been measured via x - ray analysis for the e4 galaxy ngc 720 and the e7/s0 galaxy ngc 1332 and found to be at least as elongated as the optical isophotes ( buote & canizares 1994 , 1996a , 1997a ) . for ngc 720 , which has more precise constraints , the ellipticity of the gravitating matter is @xmath19 ( 90% confidence ) compared to the intensity weighted ellipticity of the optical light , @xmath20 ( buote & canizares 1997a ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray isophotes of ngc 720 twist from being aligned with the optical isophotes within @xmath15 to a position @xmath21 offset at larger radii .",
    "this twist , when combined with the ellipticities of the x - ray isophotes , can not be explained by the projection of a reasonable triaxial matter distribution and thus may implicate a dark matter halo misaligned from the stars ( buote & canizares 1996b ; romanowsky & kochanek 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 720 and ngc 1332 were selected for analysis since they are isolated , significantly elongated in the optical , sufficiently bright , and sufficiently dominated by emission from hot gas in the _ rosat _ band . in this paper",
    "we present x - ray analysis of the classic `` shell '' galaxy , ngc 3923 , which is the last galaxy of which we are aware that satisfies these selection criteria and has deep _ rosat _ observations .",
    "this isolated e4 galaxy has both archival _ rosat _ pspc and hri data and its _ asca _ spectrum has been analyzed previously @xcite .",
    "this will serve as our final case study until the impending launch of _ axaf _ revolutionizes this field .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ obs ]",
    "we describe the _ rosat _ observations and the data reduction .",
    "we discuss removal of point sources in  [ pt ] .",
    "measurements of the ellipticities of the x - ray isophotes and the radial profiles are described in  [ e0 ] and  [ radpro ] respectively .",
    "analysis of the pspc spectrum is presented in  [ spectra ] .",
    "we give results for the geometric test for dark matter in ",
    "[ gt ] and constraints on the shape and radial mass distribution from detailed hydrostatic models in  [ models ] . finally , in  [ conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "ngc 3923 was observed with the pspc for 14.5 ks from 17 - 19 december 1991 and for 24 ks from 23 - 26 june 1993 .",
    "both observations were positioned at the field center where the point spread function is smallest . since",
    "spatial resolution is of principal importance for our analysis of the shape of the x - ray surface brightness , we analyze only the pspc data in the hard band ( pi channels 42 - 201 , @xmath22 kev ) to further optimize the size of the psf ; for details regarding the pspc psf see hasinger et al .",
    "( 1993 , updated 1994 ) and see aschenbach for a description of the _ rosat _ x - ray telescope .",
    "we reduced each observation separately with the standard xselect , ftools , and iraf - pros software .",
    "firstly , the events files were cleaned of after - pulse signals by removing any events following within 0.35 ms of a precursor .",
    "we then removed large fluctuations in the light curves indicative of scattered light from the bright earth , sun , or saa ; this resulted in filtered exposures of 13.5 ks for the 1991 observation and 21.8 ks for the 1993 observation .    to optimize signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and bin - size requirements for computing ellipticities ( see  [ e0 ] ) , we binned the cleaned events files into images with @xmath23 pixels .",
    "exposure maps for the appropriate energy band ( pi=42 - 201 ) were then generated for each image and were then used to create flattened images ; note that the intrinsic resolution of the exposure maps is @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we aligned the images using bright point sources in the field and then combined the images .",
    "the final image is displayed in figure [ fig.n3923 ]      ngc 3923 was observed with the hri for 45 ks from 10 - 17 january 1995 and for 26 ks from 22 - 26 june 1995 .",
    "both observations were positioned at the field center where the psf is smallest ( david et al .",
    "for detailed explanation of our reduction of hri data we refer the reader to the related study of ngc 720 by buote & canizares .",
    "we restricted the data to those in pulse - height analyzer ( pha ) bins 2 - 8 since they maximized the s / n of the data of each observation .",
    "for each observation we binned the events into images with @xmath25 pixels to optimize determination of ellipticities within a @xmath26 radius of the galaxy center (  [ e0 ] ) .",
    "exposure maps were generated with the standard software for each image and then used to flatten the images .",
    "an accurate aspect solution is critical to analysis of isophote shapes with the hri on small scales @xmath9 , with the amplitude of the asymmetrical distortion due to incomplete aspect correction typically being most important for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the s / n of each of the ngc 3923 observations are too small to usefully perform the aspect correction algorithm of morse .",
    "the low s / n also makes it difficult to make strong statements about the ellipticity of isolated point sources indicative of aspect error . as a result ,",
    "following buote & canizares we search for possible aspect errors by examining the positions of point sources for each of the obis ; i.e. the time intervals during which the spacecraft continuously pointed on the target .",
    "three obis contain most of the `` on time '' of the january observation : 19 ks for obi-6 , 20 ks for obi-11 , and 9 ks for obi-14 ; 28 ks is distributed fairly evenly among 12 other obis . using obi-11 as a reference ,",
    "the bright point sources in the ngc 3923 field are displaced by @xmath28 for obi-6 , and @xmath29 for obi-14 .",
    "these shifts , though statistically significant , are very consistent with the expected aspect uncertainties for a typical observation . to register all of the obis to one coordinate frame",
    ", we binned together those obis that were observed close together in time ; i.e. obis 1 - 5 , 6 - 9 , 10 - 11 , 12 - 13 , and 14 - 15 .",
    "once registered to the same coordinate frame , the images were all added . (",
    "note that the image for each of these obi groups was binned as above . )",
    "the june observation proved to be problematic because none of the 19 obis had a long enough exposure to provide very accurate source positions .",
    "hence , we were unable to perform a reliable test of the aspect solution . in order to make some estimate of the error , we grouped those obis closest together in time : obis 1 - 3 , 4 - 12 , 13 - 16 , and 17 - 19 . for three of these groups , less than @xmath25 shifts",
    "were required , but the obi 4 - 12 group required an @xmath30 shift .",
    "this large shift is questionable since all but one source was too faint to even obtain a centroid measurement using the alignment software in iraf .    as it is unclear from considerations of the obis",
    "how accurate is the aspect error for the june observation , we compared the ellipticity and orientations ( computed as described in  [ e0 ] ) of the surface brightness with those of the january observation .",
    "unfortunately , we find significant disagreement between the two observations ; note the disagreement occurs whether or not we include the obis 4 - 12 for the june observation . in particular , the position angles determined from the january observation are fully consistent with the pspc data and the optical position angles for @xmath31 , which agrees with ngc 720 and ngc 1332 ( buote & canizares 1996a , b ) ; the ellipticities are also consistent with the pspc data .",
    "the june observations , however , have position angles that differ by over @xmath32 and the ellipticities , particularly for @xmath33 are less than 0.1 as opposed to @xmath34 for the january observation . furthermore , the radial profile ( see  [ radpro ] ) of the june observation is significantly flatter for @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the isophote shapes and orientations are inconsistent for the two observations .",
    "the differences point to a serious aspect error in the june observations .",
    "that is , although we would expect aspect error to induce ellipticity in an intrinsically circular source , if the distortion occurs nearly along the minor axis of a moderately elliptical source , it will _ reduce _ the ellipticity of the source , as well as alter the position angle .",
    "the flatter inner radial profile of the june data is also consistent with uncorrected wobble . as a result",
    ", we do not include the june data in our analysis .",
    "( this is not critical since the s / n to be gained over the 45 ks is marginal . )",
    "we display the reduced january observation in figure [ fig.n3923 ] .",
    "it is readily apparent from inspection of figure [ fig.n3923 ] , particularly for the higher s / n pspc data , that the x - ray emission of ngc 3923 is significantly contaminated by foreground / background point sources . within a @xmath36 radius of the galaxy center",
    "at least 8 point sources are easily identified by visual inspection of the pspc image .",
    "( only @xmath37 is shown in the figure . )",
    "we list the positions of these sources in table [ tab.src ] .",
    ".identified point sources [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     90% confidence values of the gravitating mass corresponding to the oblate and prolate models in table [ tab.shape ] which include 90% uncertainties in the ( isothermal ) temperature .",
    "the statistical errors on the gas mass are less than 10% .    in table",
    "[ tab.mass ] we give the spherically averaged masses corresponding to the models in table [ tab.shape ] .",
    "we only quote masses at a few interesting radii to emphasize that without precise constraints on the temperature profile ( and only an aggregate constraint on the isophote shapes ) we do not really constrain the detailed mass profile .",
    "( note that the spectral constraints in  [ spectra ] which indicate an approximate isothermal gas apply only for @xmath38 kpc . )",
    "the masses of the @xmath8 and hernquist models agree very well within @xmath39 kpc as expected because over much of this region the large scale lengths of the hernquist model imply an approximate logarithmic slope of -2 . assuming the gas to be isothermal out to @xmath40 kpc , the @xmath8 model , with its flatter slope , has approximately twice the mass of the hernquist model at that distance . the gas mass is less than 1% of the gravitating mass over the entire radius range investigated .    using the total @xmath41-band luminosity from faber et al .",
    "scaled to 30 mpc , @xmath42 erg @xmath43 s@xmath44 , we have that the @xmath41-band mass - to - light ratio in solar units is @xmath45 at @xmath39 kpc for the @xmath46 and hernquist models . at @xmath47 kpc ,",
    "the @xmath46 model has @xmath48 while the hernquist model has @xmath49 .",
    "these @xmath50 values within @xmath39 kpc are very consistent with stellar dynamical studies of ellipticals ( e.g. van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "the larger ( extrapolated ) @xmath50 values at @xmath51 kpc agree with previous x - ray studies of ellipticals ( e.g. sarazin 1997 ) indicating that ngc 3923 has a mass distribution typical for a galaxy of its luminosity .",
    "we have analyzed the gravitating matter distribution of the e4 galaxy ngc 3923 using archival x - ray data from the _ rosat _ pspc and hri .",
    "analysis of the pspc data , which allows more precise constraints than the hri data , demonstrates that the x - ray isophotes are significantly elongated with ellipticity @xmath0 ( 90% confidence ) for semi - major axis @xmath1 kpc and have position angles aligned with the optical isophotes within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "a bright point source located @xmath52 along the major axis inhibits reliable ellipticity constraints for larger radii .    by applying a `` geometric test '' for dark matter , which essentially compares the shapes of the observed x - ray isophotes to those predicted",
    "if mass traces the optical light @xmath53 ( independent of the poorly constrained temperature profile of the gas ) , we found that the ellipticity of the pspc x - ray surface brightness exceeds that predicted by the constant @xmath54 hypothesis at the 80%-85% confidence level .",
    "the `` geometric test '' result is conservative since it only considers signatures of dark matter that are distributed differently from the optical light .",
    "although the evidence for dark matter from the geometric test is marginal , the results from models which employ an explicit solution of the hydrostatic equation assuming an isothermal gas ( which is supported by the pspc spectrum   [ spectra ] ) indicate that @xmath2 is highly inconsistent with the radial profiles of the pspc and hri data ( @xmath55 for 16 dof ) .",
    "this particular discrepancy arises because @xmath53 is too centrally concentrated : the derived scale length of the gravitating matter is approximately 1.5 - 2 times that of @xmath53 .",
    "the ellipticities predicted by this @xmath2 model fall below the pspc data at a significance slightly greater than the 90% level .",
    "modeling the gravitating mass with a density run @xmath8 or with a hernquist profile we find that the ellipticity of the gravitating matter is , @xmath56 ( 90% confidence ) , which is larger than the intensity weighted optical ellipticity @xmath57 .",
    "this evidence for dark matter which is more flattened and more extended than @xmath53 is similar to our conclusions from previous x - ray studies of two other ellipticals , ngc 720 and ngc 1332 , but at somewhat smaller significance level than for ngc 720 ( e.g. buote & canizares 1997b ) .",
    "these results are consistent with analyses of known gravitational lenses ( e.g. keeton , kochanek , & falco 1997 ) , two polar ring galaxies ( sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; sackett & pogge 1995 ) , and flaring disks in spiral galaxies ( e.g , olling 1996 ) .",
    "the ellipticities of the gravitating matter derived from our x - ray analyses and these other methods are consistent with those of halos produced by cdm simulations ( e.g. dubinski 1994 ) .",
    "if an isothermal gas is assumed then models with matter density @xmath8 are favored over hernquist models ( and similar models like the universal cdm profile of navarro et al .",
    "for @xmath58 the @xmath8 model marginally fits the data better than the hernquist model .",
    "however , most of the difference in these models occurs in the central radial bins where the effects of multi - phase cooling flows , magnetic fields , and discrete sources could affect the surface brightness profiles , though we have argued the effects are unlikely to be important ( see  [ models ] ) .",
    "( the derived shape of the gravitating mass is mostly robust to these issues  buote & canizares 1997b . )",
    "this support for nearly @xmath59 profiles agrees with previous studies of gravitational lenses ( e.g. maoz & rix 1993 ; kochanek 1995 ) , although a recent paper finds that density profiles with changing slopes ( e.g. hernquist and nfw ) are preferred @xcite .",
    "an emission component that is proportional to @xmath53 can not contribute significantly to the _ rosat _ x - ray emission of ngc 3923 , and thus discrete sources should not affect our constraints on the gravitating matter ( buote & canizares 1997a ) .",
    "however , the _ asca _ spectral data when fitted with two thermal components yield a cold component , @xmath60 kev , and a hot component , @xmath61 kev , where the relative flux of cold - to - hot is @xmath62 in the _ rosat _ band @xcite . the conventional interpretation of the hot component ( e.g. matsumoto et al . 1997 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ) is that it arises from discrete sources .",
    "but our analysis (  [ radpro ] ) shows that @xmath63 of the 0.5 - 2 kev emission can not be distributed like the optical light which would be expected of discrete sources .",
    "hence , either the emission from discrete sources is not distributed like @xmath53 , or the hot component obtained from the spectral fits can not be entirely due to discrete sources as suggested by buote & fabian .",
    "the constraints we have obtained for ngc 720 , ngc 1332 , and now ngc 3923 from analyses of their x - ray isophote shapes and radial surface brightness profiles provide an initial demonstration of the power of x - ray analysis for probing the shape and radial distribution of gravitating matter in early - type galaxies .",
    "the next generation of x - ray satellites , particularly _ axaf _ and _ xmm _ , have the capability to accurately map x - ray isophote shapes and orientations from the cores ( @xmath64 ) out to 10s of kpc for many galaxies ) which hindered the present analysis of ngc 3923 . ] . the spatially resolved spectra provided by these future missions will allow more precise constraints on temperature gradients and the contribution from discrete sources .",
    "thus , unlike most other methods , obtaining interesting x - ray constraints on the shape and radial density profile of the gravitating matter will be possible for a large sample of early - type galaxies since the x - ray analysis is applicable to any isolated early - type galaxy whose soft x - ray emission ( @xmath65 kev ) is dominated by hot gas .",

    "<S> we conclude that mass density profiles with @xmath8 are favored over steeper profiles if the gas is essentially isothermal ( which is suggested by the pspc spectrum ) and the surface brightness in the central regions @xmath9 is not modified substantially by a multi - phase cooling flow , magnetic fields , or discrete sources . </S>",
