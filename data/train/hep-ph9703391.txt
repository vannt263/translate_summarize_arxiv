    "present day colliders test the standard model at an energy scale of order 100  gev .",
    "precision experiments at lep , slc and tevatron ( with some additional measurements at lower energies ) have measured more than twenty separate experimental observables , and have confirmed the standard model predictions with an accuracy of one part in a thousand @xcite .",
    "a few anomalies in the data could suggest hints of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite , although no deviations have been rigorously confirmed .    nevertheless , the verification of the standard model is not yet complete .",
    "absent to date is any experimental signal that sheds light on the dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "any consistent theory of electroweak symmetry breaking must generate goldstone bosons which are absorbed by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge bosons , thereby generating the gauge boson masses .",
    "the standard model posits that electroweak symmetry breaking is due to the dynamics of a weakly - coupled complex doublet ( with hypercharge one ) of elementary scalar fields .",
    "the physical consequence of this model is the existence of a cp - even neutral higgs boson with mass roughly of order @xmath2 .",
    "extensions of this model can easily be constructed , in which the scalar sector is enlarged .",
    "the resulting model then contains a _ non - minimal _ higgs sector consisting of neutral higgs bosons ( of definite or indefinite cp depending on the model ) and charged higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "the best motivated non - minimal higgs sector is the two higgs doublet model . starting with two complex scalar doublets of hypercharge @xmath3 respectively",
    ", one finds a higgs sector ( after three goldstone bosons are absorbed to give mass to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) consisting of five states : a light cp - even higgs scalar , @xmath4 , a heavy cp - even scalar , @xmath5 , a cp - odd scalar @xmath6 , and a charged higgs pair , @xmath7 .",
    "this is the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .    in the global fits of lep , slc , and tevatron data based on the standard model ,",
    "there is weak ( but non - trivial ) sensitivity to the higgs boson mass by virtue of higgs mediated radiative corrections .",
    "the most recent global fits find that @xmath8  gev at @xmath9 cl @xcite , although some care needs to be taken in interpreting this limit @xcite .",
    "the potential for improving this bound at future colliders is discussed in section ii . in the context of the standard model ,",
    "the higgs boson in this mass range is necessarily weakly - coupled .",
    "moreover , such fits also apply to non - minimal higgs sectors in which the lightest higgs scalar ( @xmath4 ) is separated in mass from heavier non - minimal higgs states .",
    "therefore , there is a strong motivation to conduct a vigorous experimental search for weakly - coupled higgs bosons at lep and future colliders .",
    "if a higgs boson with standard model properties were discovered , then one might naively conclude that the search for the model of the elementary particles has been completed .",
    "however , theorists strongly believe that the standard model can not be the fundamental model of particles . apart from the many parameters of the standard model which must be inserted by hand ( with no explanation )",
    ", there is a theoretical problem in the standard model associated with the very large hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "we know that the planck scale , @xmath10 gev , exists in nature ; it characterizes the energy scale above which gravitational interactions can not be neglected relative to the strong and electroweak interactions of the elementary particles .",
    "given the existence of such a large energy scale , one must explain how the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , which is so small when expressed in units of the planck scale ( @xmath11 ) , could be generated by a fundamental theory of particles that includes gravity .",
    "related to this question is the theoretical problem of generating a `` naturally '' light higgs boson ( with a mass of order @xmath12 ) , since in the standard model , there is no symmetry that can protect the mass of an elementary scalar from being driven up to @xmath13 via radiative corrections .",
    "these problems are intimately connected with the dynamics that generates electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "attempts to solve the problem of hierarchy and the related problem of the unnaturally light higgs boson inevitably lead to the existence of new physics at the 1  tev energy scale or below .",
    "possible mechanisms invoke either supersymmetry @xcite ( a symmetry that can protect the masses of elementary scalars ) or dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite ( which typically eliminates elementary scalar fields completely ) .",
    "which path nature chooses can only be determined through experimentation .",
    "thus the central goals of the future colliders program are : to explore the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking , and to determine its implications for the structure of the standard model and the nature of physics that lies beyond the standard model .    in this report",
    ", we assume that nature chooses a weakly - coupled higgs sector as the source of electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics .",
    "we do not address the alternative approach which invokes strong interaction dynamics as the source of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the phenomenology of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector in this latter case is explored by the strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking working group @xcite .",
    "the focus of this working group is the weakly - coupled higgs sector of the standard model , and possible non - minimal higgs sector extensions ( including the higgs sector of the mssm ) .",
    "although there is considerable freedom for the structure of the scalar sector ( even after imposing all known theoretical and phenomenological constraints ) , models of the scalar sector often exhibit the following structure : ( i ) the lightest scalar ( @xmath4 ) is a cp - even neutral higgs boson with couplings closely approximating those of the standard model higgs boson ( @xmath14 ) , and ( ii ) additional higgs scalars ( neutral higgs bosons with definite or indefinite cp quantum numbers and charged higgs bosons ) are expected to be heavier ( perhaps significantly heavier ) than @xmath4 , although still weakly - coupled .",
    "this is the so - called _ decoupling limit _ which will be discussed in section iiia . in this case",
    ", the discovery of @xmath15 is not sufficient to probe the underlying structure of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "the essence of the decoupling limit is that the existence of a light cp - even higgs boson with properties closely approximating those of @xmath14 is consistent with many possible non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "thus , the discovery of the heavy non - minimal higgs scalars is essential in order to probe the details of the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics .",
    "the mssm provides a natural framework for light elementary higgs scalars .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is a constrained two - higgs - doublet model , whose tree - level properties are determined by two free parameter ( typically chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd state , @xmath6 , and the ratio of vacuum expectation values , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the decoupling limit of the model corresponds to @xmath17 ; in this limit , the properties of @xmath4 become identical to those of @xmath14 .",
    "extensions of the mssm higgs sector are also possible . for example , the simplest non - minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( nmssm ) consists of a higgs sector with two doublets and one singlet of complex higgs fields @xcite .",
    "thus , a detailed exploration of the scalar sector has the potential for probing both the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics and the underlying supersymmetric structure of the theory .",
    "present experimental data tells us that the higgs sector must be compatible with    ( ) .5 in .7 in    @xmath18 ;    the absence of significant higgs mediated flavor changing neutral currents ;    the absence of significant virtual charged higgs mediated effects ( which can contribute , _",
    "e.g. _ , to @xmath19@xmath20 mixing , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "even after imposing such model constraints , there is still significant freedom in the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "exotic higgs sectors ( beyond those mentioned above ) are easily constructed that satisfy all present day phenomenological constraints .",
    "such higgs sectors could arise in models with extended gauge groups , models with exotic scalar multiplets , or models with a lepton number violating sector ( _ e.g. _ , in r - parity violating models of low - energy supersymmetry @xcite , in which there is no distinction between scalar lepton superpartners and higgs bosons ) . sorting out the details of the scalar sector",
    "will be one of the fundamental challenges for future collider experimentation .",
    "the weakly - coupled higgs boson and precision electroweak physics working group program consisted of the following tasks :    1 .",
    "extend present day precision tests of the standard model + this will serve to tighten constraints on the higgs sector and perhaps uncover deviations from the standard model and provide evidence for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "2 .   evaluate the higgs boson discovery reach of future colliders + high energy colliders are needed to directly produce the massive higgs bosons .",
    "however , the cleanest decay channels of the higgs boson usually have rather small branching ratios .",
    "thus , high luminosity is critical to insure that higgs signals can be extracted from the standard model backgrounds . in table",
    "[ colliders ] , we list the approved and possible future collider facilities considered in our study . furthermore , special features of the collider detectors ( such as the high resolution for the electromagnetic calorimeter for @xmath23 , and high @xmath24 tagging efficiency ) are also required in order to maximize the significance of the higgs signal .",
    "thus , establishing the discovery reach for future colliders is an important and non - trivial first step in the pursuit of the higgs boson .",
    "3 .   consider precision measurements of @xmath4 properties + the discovery of the higgs boson will complete the experimental verification of the standard model .",
    "once the higgs boson is discovered , one must check that it does indeed possess couplings to particles proportional to their masses .",
    "one should quickly be able to verify that the properties of the scalar state roughly match those expected for the standard model higgs boson .",
    "more precise measurements may be required to detect deviations of the observed higgs properties from that of the @xmath14 .",
    "the difficulty of this latter task will depend on how close one is to the decoupling limit ( see section iiia ) .",
    "4 .   evaluate the potential for direct detection of the non - minimal higgs states and the measurement their properties + this is essential for probing the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics .",
    "in addition , the non - minimal higgs states may be sensitive to physics associated with the hierarchy problem ( for example , the properties of the non - minimal higgs states in supersymmetric models can provide important checks of the supersymmetric dynamics ) .",
    "the non - minimal higgs sector imposes the most stringent requirements on the collider facility . to accomplish",
    "this task may require the highest energies and luminosities now being considered .",

    "in the electroweak standard model , there are two coupling parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , of @xmath35 gauge interactions .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field , @xmath36 , sets the mass scale . at tree level ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson masses @xmath37 , as well as the weak mixing angle @xmath38 , are determined by these three parameters . alternatively , one may use the precisely measured quantities  the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath39 , the muon decay constant @xmath40 and @xmath2as inputs to evaluate the other electroweak parameters .",
    "when the radiative corrections are taken into account , the relations among these parameters become dependent on @xmath41 , @xmath42 as well as other possible contributions from new physics .",

    "once the non - minimal higgs bosons are directly discovered , detailed measurements of their properties would yield significant clues to the underlying structure of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , if the higgs sector arises from a two - doublet model , then precision studies of the heavy higgs states can provide a direct measurement of the important parameter @xmath16 ( the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values ) . can not be distinguished from @xmath14 ) , measurements of processes involving @xmath4 alone can not yield any information on the value of @xmath16 . ]",
    "the measurement of @xmath16 can also provide a critical self - consistency test of the mssm , since the parameter @xmath16 also governs the properties of the charginos and neutralinos ( and can in principle be determined in precision measurements of supersymmetric processes ) .",
    "moreover , the couplings of higgs bosons to supersymmetric particles will provide invaluable insights into both the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and the structure of low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "the possibility that the heavy non - minimal higgs states have non - negligible branching ratios to supersymmetric partners can furnish an additional experimental tool for probing the higgs boson  supersymmetry connection . as in the case of the @xmath14 discussed above , the lepton colliders ( assuming @xmath50 for the nlc and @xmath51 for the fmc ) provide the most powerful set of tools for extracting the magnitudes of the higgs couplings to fermion and vector boson pairs .",
    "the higgs couplings to vector boson pairs directly probe the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking [ via the sum rule of eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) ] .",
    "the higgs coupling to two photons , depends ( through their one - loop contributions ) on all charged states whose masses are generated by their couplings to the higgs sector .",
    "precision measurements of the higgs couplings to fermions are sensitive to other higgs sector parameters ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath52 and the neutral higgs mixing parameter @xmath39 in a two - higgs - doublet model ) .",
    "additional information can be ascertained if higgs self - interactions could be directly measured .",
    "this would in principle provide direct experimental access to the higgs potential .",
    "unfortunately , there are very few cases where the measurement of higgs self - couplings has been shown to be viable @xcite .",
    "finally , one should also consider the possible effects of virtual higgs interactions @xcite . in some models ,",
    "flavor changing neutral currents mediated by neutral higgs bosons may be observable .",
    "the cp - properties of the heavy higgs states could be mixed , leading to higgs mediated cp - violating effects that could be observed in processes with heavy flavor . in some cases , precision measurements of low - energy observables can be quite sensitive to the heavy higgs states .",
    "the canonical example is the process @xmath21 , which can be significantly enhanced due to charged higgs boson exchange . if there are no other competing non - standard model contributions ( and this is a big _ if _ ) , then present data excludes charged higgs masses less than about 250 gev @xcite .",
    "eventually , when non - minimal higgs states are directly probed , it is essential to check for the consistency between their properties as determined from direct observation and from their virtual effects .",
    "this working group has examined the potential of a program of future precision electroweak measurements @xcite and the search for weakly - coupled higgs boson at future colliders @xcite .",
    "the goal of such a program is to address the outstanding problem of elementary particle physics : what is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and the nature of the dynamics responsible for it ?        improvements of precision electroweak measurements can provide an important consistency check of the higgs interpretation of a higgs signal , in the same way that the lep electroweak data provided support for the tevatron interpretation of the top - quark events .",
    "discovery of a higgs - like signal alone may not be sufficient to earn a place in the particle data group ( pdg ) tables .",
    "some basic measurements of the properties of the higgs candidate will be essential to confirm a higgs interpretation of the discovery .",
    "higgs searches at lep-2 , run - ii of the tevatron and/or the lhc will almost certainly discover a higgs signal if electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics is weakly coupled .",
    "moreover , measurements at these machines will yield evidence for the higgs interpretation that is sufficient to pass pdg muster in some fraction of the higgs parameter space .",
    "the nlc ( and fmc ) can discover or definitively rule out the existence of a higgs boson in the intermediate higgs mass regime ( the mass region most problematical for the higgs search at hadron colliders ) .",
    "once a higgs boson is discovered , the lepton colliders would play a decisive role in the precision measurement of higgs sector properties .",
    "it is not unlikely that the first higgs state to be discovered will be experimentally indistinguishable from the standard model higgs boson .",
    "this occurs in many theoretical models that exhibit the decoupling of heavy scalar states . in this decoupling limit , the lightest higgs state",
    ", @xmath4 is a neutral cp - even scalar with properties nearly identical to the @xmath14 , while the other higgs bosons of the non - minimal higgs sector are heavy ( compared to the @xmath1 ) and are approximately mass - degenerate . thus , discovery of @xmath15 may shed little light on the dynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is then crucial to directly detect and explore the properties of the non - minimal higgs states .",
    "in particular , precision measurements are critical in order to distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath14 and/or to map out the properties of the non - minimal higgs states . to accomplish these goals , future colliders of the highest energies and luminosities , considered in this report , are essential .",
    "we have entered a new era in higgs phenomenology .",
    "the methods by which the first higgs signal will be identified are well known and have been studied in great detail .",
    "however , the most outstanding challenge facing the future higgs searches lies in identifying and exploring in detail the properties of the non - minimal higgs states .",
    "a successful exploration will have a profound effect on our understanding of tev - scale physics .",

    "<S> we examine the prospects for discovering and elucidating the weakly - coupled higgs sector at future collider experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs search consists of three phases : ( i ) discovery of a higgs candidate , ( ii ) verification of the higgs interpretation of the signal , and ( iii ) precision measurements of higgs sector properties . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of one higgs boson with standard model properties is not sufficient to expose the underlying structure of the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is critical to search for evidence for a non - minimal higgs sector and/or new physics associated with electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement in precision electroweak data at future colliders can play a useful role in confirming the theoretical interpretation of the higgs search results . </S>"
