    "supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) are very attractive from the theoretical point of view as they allow to obtain the sm from a single unified gauge group  @xcite .",
    "apart from predicting for instance the quantization of electric charge , they reduce the number of free parameters . for example",
    ", they give the right value for the electroweak mixing angle and may provide a good framework for the understanding of the flavour problem .",
    "indeed , several gut models have been studied in the literature , having as prediction a mass relation between down - quark masses and the charged leptons .",
    "for instance in the @xmath1 unified framework georgi and jarlskog have found the mass relation  @xcite @xmath2 which is in good agreement with data to first approximation , assuming that holds at the gut scale , and taking into account renormalization group running to low energies , with suitable susy threshold effects .",
    "such mass relations are very welcome since , by itself , the standard model sheds no light on the flavour problem .",
    "however , the large hadron collider has so far not found any evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , the only major discovery to date has been that of a new boson which is entirely consistent with the properties of the sm higgs boson , arising from a single higgs doublet @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the lhc has not so far found any evidence for supersymmetry ( susy ) as indicated within the simplest grand unified theories ( guts ) , namely those which do not involve an intermediate scale such as @xmath1 .",
    "here we advocate an alternative tev - scale approach to the flavour problem employing just the standard model gauge symmetry , supplemented only by a non - abelian discrete flavour symmetry . for the latter we adopt @xmath0 , the discrete group of even permutations of four objects isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the tetrahedron .",
    "it is the smallest group containing triplet irreducible representations .",
    "several @xmath0-based flavour models have been suggested  @xcite , for reviews see refs .",
    "recently three of us have proposed an 21 model  @xcite based on the discrete family symmetry @xmath0 leading to the quark - lepton mass relation : @xmath4 it is clear that eq.([massrel ] ) provides an interesting generalization of eq.([gut ] ) which is found to be in very good agreement with data .",
    "given that it is approximately renormalization group invariant , it holds at all mass scales  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the georgi - jarlskog relation , eq .",
    "( [ massrelation ] ) arises just from the flavour structure of the model , and the fact from the existence of two higgs doublets selectively coupled to the up- and down - type fermions  ) is more general , relying only of the two - doublet nature of the higgs sector , as mentioned above . here",
    "we abandon the use of supersymmetry . ] .",
    "both of these were assigned to be @xmath0 triplets , with one of them coupling to the down - type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "note that the model in @xcite employed an extended higgs sector with three families of supersymmetric higgs doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 for which there is presently no evidence , with present data being consistent with a single higgs doublet .",
    "moreover , the model predicted @xmath7 . while providing a good starting point for the ckm matrix ,",
    "a derivation of the full quark mixing was lacking .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an alternative discrete family symmetry @xmath0 model , keeping the same motivation for introducing @xmath0 into the standard model  @xcite , namely , to shed light on the flavour problem . indeed",
    "the model presented here provides a fully realistic description of all quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , and in particular reproduces the successful quark - lepton mass relation in eq.([massrel ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous construction in @xcite its remains closer in spirit to the sm , since we do not assume supersymmetry nor unification , keeping a single higgs doublet @xmath3 instead of multi - higgs doublets .",
    "in particular , we assign right - handed up quarks to singlet representation of @xmath0 instead of triplet as in the original model .",
    "the @xmath0 flavour symmetry is broken by sm singlet flavons which distinguish up - type quarks from down - type quarks and charged leptons , with additional flavons in the neutrino sector , where we require extra abelian discrete groups to distinguish these sectors . assuming full explicit breaking of @xmath0 through suitable scalar flavon multiplets we show that this simple modification of the model in @xcite can describe all the ckm mixing parameters .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to obtain also the so called _ zee - wolfenstein _ mass matrix pattern in the neutrino sector using @xmath0 invariance  @xcite .",
    "however , since it predicts bi - maximal mixing , current neutrino oscillation data analysis  @xcite rule out such a pattern @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple modification of the zee - wolfenstein model where all the mixing angle , as well as the reactor angle can be reproduced .",
    "3.mm in the next section we introduce our model , in section [ sec3 ] we obtain our quark - lepton mass relation , in section [ sec4 ] we give the fit for the quark mixing parameters , in section [ sec5 ] we describe the neutrino mass generation mechanism and study its phenomenological implications , while in section [ sec6 ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the matter content and the flavour group assignment are given in table [ tablamodel ] .",
    "note that all the fermions , apart of the @xmath8 fields , are assigned to triplets of @xmath0  . in the scalar sector",
    "we have one sm higgs doublet and four flavon fields .",
    "with respect to the model of ref.@xcite we have extra abelian symmetries , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for imposing such a symmetries is because our present model is not supersymmetric .",
    "we are replacing the susy - higgs doublets @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( triplet of @xmath0 in ref.@xcite ) with scalar @xmath14-singlets ( flavons ) triplets of @xmath0 times the standard model higgs doublet , namely @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 symmetries glue the @xmath17 and @xmath18 flavons fields to the up and down quark sectors , respectively , while the extra @xmath19 symmetry is used to separate the charged and neutral fermion sectors .",
    ".matter content of the model .",

    "we remind that the product of two @xmath0 triplets is given by @xmath22 where the two triplet contractions can be written as the symmetric and the antisymmetric ones and denoted as @xmath23 there is only one triplet irreducible representation , here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not different irreducible representations , but simply a way to indicate different contractions . ] .",
    "thus we have that @xmath26 while @xmath27 , implying that @xmath28 gives only two couplings @xmath29 and @xmath30 . on the other hand @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "can be @xmath33 in such a way that @xmath34 .",
    "note that , while the @xmath0 flavour symmetry holds in the ( non - renormalizable ) yukawa terms leading to charged fermion masses , we assume it to be completely broken in the scalar potential .",
    "indeed , we assume that the scalar flavon multiplets get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in an arbitrary direction of @xmath0 , preserving none of its subgroups .",
    "this can be easily achieved just by including terms in the scalar potential which are @xmath35 invariant as discussed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the flavon scalar fields get vevs in arbitrary directions of @xmath0 , that is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to complete the model we need also to specify the mechanism of neutrino mass generation , see sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , below .",
    "from the @xmath0 contraction rules ( see appendix [ a4group ] ) and the fact that the charged leptons and down - type quarks are in the same @xmath0 representations , one sees that the charged leptons and down - type quark mass matrices have the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",

    "this system can be solved and we find @xmath45 in the limit @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these equations are general in the sense that in the complex case , namely complex yukawa couplings and vevs , the invariants , eqs .",
    "( [ i1])-([i3 ] ) do not depend on the phases of the vevs @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , the only dependence on the relative phase of the yukawa couplings , @xmath49 and @xmath50 enters in the determinant , eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) , and this is negligible in the above limit . from eqs .",
    "( [ ralpha]),([af]),([bf ] ) , one finds simple relations for the second and third family masses , namely , @xmath51 from which we require @xmath52 in order to account for the second and third family mass hierarchy .",
    "moreover , since the charged leptons and down - type quarks couple to the same higgs and flavons , we have assignments , namely the fact that the same flavon @xmath18 couple to down quarks and charged leptons . ]",
    "@xmath53 so that , from eq .  ( [ ralpha ] ) , we obtain the mass relation  @xcite @xmath54    3.mm now we turn to the up - type quark sector . from the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , the up quark mass matrix is given by @xmath55 in what follows we discuss the resulting structure of the quark mixing matrix .",
    "recall that the down - type quark mass matrix takes the form in eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) while the up - type quark mass matrix has just been given in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) . out of these matrices",
    "one finds the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "their diagonalization results in two unitary matrices @xmath58 for which one can obtain approximate analytical expressions . in the down sector , from @xmath59 , one finds , @xmath60 one sees that if @xmath61 the down sector gives about the cabibbo angle in the @xmath62 plane while the mixings in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 planes are negligible . on the other hand from the up quark sector",

    "( [ mu ] ) have a hierarchical structure as determined from eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) . ] .",
    "thus for the up quark matrix mixing factor @xmath67 we have that @xmath68 where we have assumed @xmath69 the overall quark mixing matrix is given by the product @xmath70 one sees how the cabibbo angle arises from the down - type quark matrix mixing factor @xmath71 , while the @xmath72 and @xmath73 ckm mixing angles arise from the up quark matrix mixing factor @xmath67 .",
    "taking @xmath74 we obtain approximately the correct value for the mixing angle .",
    "however the order one parameters are relevant in order to exactly determinate the quark mixing angles . in order to obtain quantitative predictions for these",
    "we perform a global numerical fit . the experimental data used and the one  @xmath75 error bars are given in the second column of table  [ input ] , taking the quark masses ( at the scale of the @xmath76 ) from  @xcite and the quark mixing angles from  @xcite .",
    "the third column of table  [ input ] displays the values predicted by our model when the values of its parameters are those in equations  ( [ param ] ) .",
    "we note that the phases of the up couplings @xmath77 can be reabsorbed by transforming the right - handed fields @xmath78 while in the down sector not all the phases can be removed . for simplicity",
    "we assume all the couplings to be real and we show how to make a fit of the quark mixing parameters ( including the complex phase ) and masses .",
