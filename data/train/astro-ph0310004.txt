    "the cores of many galaxy clusters are sufficiently dense and cool that the plasma cooling time is shorter than a hubble time . for many years",
    "it was thought that runaway cooling would result in a large central mass deposition rate @xcite .",
    "chandra and xmm observations have altered this picture significantly  there appears to be a core temperature floor of 1 - 2 kev , and inferred mass deposition rates have been reduced by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the lack of colder gas , including heating by agn , heat conduction from cluster halo plasma , and small - scale variations in the cooling and metallicity structure of the plasma .",
    "each of these processes can potentially leave a specific observational signature .",
    "for example , if conduction provides the energy required to arrest the cooling then the core plasma may be single - phase , but if agn and/or small - scale inhomogeneities are responsible , one might expect to see observational signatures indicating the presence of multiphase plasma .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of 12 galaxy clusters found in the data archive of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ for evidence of multiphase plasma in each cluster core .",
    "we first describe the method , briefly sketching the markov chain monte carlo technique , and apply it to a sample of clusters .",
    "we then discuss the results and their implications for cooling flows .",
    "we use a simple core - halo geometry and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations to assess the statistical significance of the presence of multiphase plasma in a sample of clusters .",
    "we compare two models of the emssion : a simple model @xmath0 which contains one emission component in the halo and one in the core , and a complex model @xmath1 which contains one in the halo and two in the core ( see figure  [ arabadjis_f1 ] ) .",
    "each model is fit to a data set consisting of two spectra , one from the outer annulus and one from the inner annulus . because @xmath0 lies on a boundary of the parameter space of @xmath1 ( i.e.  the normalization of the second core component goes to zero ; figure  [ arabadjis_f2 ] ) , the standard @xmath2 test can not be used @xcite .",
    "we must instead construct an _",
    "@xmath2 distribution , using mcmc sampling ( sketched below ) , to which we apply the @xmath2 test .",
    "the @xmath2 statistic ,    @xmath3    is a measure of the improvement in a fit when the simple model is replaced by the complex model .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution of a large number of data realizations allows us to quantitatively compare these two models by comparing the @xmath2 distribution to the @xmath2 value of the original data set .",
    "given the ( known ) probability distribution function @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the vector of model parameters , we construct an empirical @xmath2 distribution using mcmc sampling and perform an @xmath2 test to determine the significance of a second emission component in the core .",

    "the length of the burn - in phase depends upon the sensibility of the starting point , and the appropriateness of the scale chosen for the proposal probability distribution step .",
    "this is not a consideration in our case because we start each mcmc sample at the ( already known ) peak of the probability distribution function @xmath4 .    in practice",
    "this recipe is computationally intensive , not because of any features of the mcmc sampling _ per se _ , but because each of the faked spectra must be modelled twice . for a sample size of 1000 simulations",
    ", xspec must simulate 1000 spectra and calculate 2002 sets of best - fit values for the model parameters ( including the original data ) .",
    "this fact leads us to simplify the method .",
    "first , in order to reduce the modelling time , we have adopted a simplified core - halo geometry . in this scheme",
    "the `` core '' is represented by a single shell ( in this case a sphere ) , while the halo is represented by another shell .",
    "thus @xmath7 contains four parameters , the temperature and density of each of the two shells , while @xmath15 contains six , the additional two parameters representing the temperature and density of a second cospatial emission component in the core .",
    "this simplification also greatly improves the numerical stability of the fitting procedure . the algorithm ( steps 1 - 6 above ) is implemented in a tcl script run within xspec .",
    "once we have completed step 7 we can distinguish between the models .",
    "the location of the @xmath2 value of the data within this empirical @xmath2 distribution contains information regarding the relative merit of @xmath7 and @xmath15 .",
    "we define the significance @xmath16 of the distribution as    @xmath17    the signficance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the probability that the simple model constitutes the better description , and that the @xmath2 value of the data is this large strictly by chance .",
    "thus , for a one - parameter model , @xmath20 , 0.90 , and 0.99 may be interpreted as 1 , 2 and 3@xmath21 detections of the additional component . when discussing the presence of a second emission component in the x - ray data ,",
    "we adopt 99% as a threshold significance .",
    "we apply this method to 12 clusters observed with chandra .",
    "all clusters in the sample are fairly round and , with the exception of cl0024 , seem to be fairly spherical with no significant amounts of substructure .",
    "ten of these clusters are generally agreed to contain `` cooling flows '' in their centers , while two of them , cl0024 and a2104 , do not .",
    "( @xcite derives an upper limit to the cooling rate in a2104 . ) in each cluster , the core size is defined as the radial extent containing roughly 3000 - 4000 source photons . except for hydra",
    "a , all of the clusters in the sample admit a second emission component in this region .",
    "( in hydra a , the best - fit temperature of the second component equals that of the first , rendering an mcmc @xmath2-test irrelevant . )",
    "the resulting f distributions for the entire sample are shown in figure  [ arabadjis_f3 ] .",
    "statistics for each cluster are shown below .",
    "we list list the cluster , the pre - chandra / xmm cooling rates from the literature , a reference for this value , and the multiphase plasma mcmc signficance .",
    "1. the 12 chandra clusters in the sample .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath22 there are no measurements ( nor upper limits ) of + cooling flow plasma in cl0024 in the literature .",
    "of the 10 cooling flow clusters in the sample , only three of them  a2029",
    ", a2204 , and zw3146  show evidence for multiphase gas in the core , if we adopt @xmath23 as our significance threshold .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the fact that the two clusters with the largest pre - chandra / xmm mass deposition rates ",
    "ms2137 and zw3146  display such dramatically different evidence for the existence of multiphase plasma .",
    "both were suspected of harboring cooling flows with rates in excess of 1000 m@xmath24 y@xmath25 , and yet ms2137 shows no evidence of multiphase gas .",
    "( as expected , the two non - cooling flow clusters also show no evidence for a second core emission component . )",
    "it could be that , in the absence of recent core merging events , the equilibrium state of the plasma is uniphase , and that the merger and accretion of smaller ( and cooler ) substructures during the continuing assembly of the cluster are responsible for some clusters showing evidence of multiphase cores .",
    "if this were the case , one might look for some evidence for a merging event in ms2137 which has occured within a cooling time .",
    "( as yet we have not found none . )",
    "regardless , it seems that cooling flow cluster cores are an inhomogeneous class ."
