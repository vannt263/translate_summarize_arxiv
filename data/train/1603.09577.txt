    "in the past decades , the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method , as a numerical approach originated from the lattice gas automata or developed from the simplified kinetic models , has gained great success in the simulation of the complex flows @xcite , and has also been extended to solve some partial differential equations , including the diffusion equation @xcite , wave equation @xcite , burgers equation @xcite , poisson equation @xcite , isotropic and anisotropic convection - diffusion equations ( cdes ) @xcite .",
    "however , most of these available works related to cdes mainly focused on the linear cde for its important role in the study of the heat and mass transfer @xcite .",
    "recently , through constructing a proper equilibrium distribution function , shi and guo @xcite proposed a single - relaxation - time ( srt ) lb model or the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) model for nonlinear convection - diffusion equations ( ncdes ) where a nonlinear convection and/or diffusion term is included .",
    "although the model has a second - order convergence rate in space @xcite , and can also be considered as an extension to some available works , it still has some limitations .",
    "the first is that when the bgk model is used to solve the ncdes where the diffusion coefficient is very small , the relaxation parameter would be close to its limit value , thus the model may suffer from the stability or accuracy problem @xcite .",
    "secondly , the bgk model is usually limited to solve the nonlinear isotropic cdes since it does not have sufficient relaxation parameters to describe the anisotropic diffusion process , while the multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) lb model with more relaxation parameters seems more suitable and more reasonable in solving ncde with anisotropic diffusion process . and finally , it is also well known that in the bgk model , only a single relaxation process is used to characterize the collision effects , which means all modes relax to their equilibria with the same rate , while from a physical point of view , these rates corresponding to different modes should be different from each other during the collision process @xcite . to overcome these deficiencies inherent in the bgk model , in this work we will present a general mrt lb model for the nonlinear anisotropic cde ( nacde ) , and show that , through the chapman - enskog analysis , the nacde with a source term can be recovered correctly from the proposed model . besides , it is also found that , similar to our previous bgk model @xcite , the present mrt model also has a second - order convergence rate in space , while it could be more stable and more accurate than the bgk model through tuning the relaxation parameters properly .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a general mrt model for nacde with a source term",
    "is first presented , and then some special cases and distinct characteristics of the present model are also discussed . in section 3",
    ", the accuracy and convergence rate of the mrt model are tested through some classic cdes , followed by a comparison between the present mrt model and the bgk model , and finally , some conclusions are given in section 4 .",
