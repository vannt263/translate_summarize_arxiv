    "symmetric correlators appear e.g. in qcd as ( holomorphic part of ) kernels of bfkl equations @xcite of perturbative regge asymptotics or of dglap / erbl equations @xcite of bjorken asymptotics . in the latter case",

    "the algebra generator form is preferred .",
    "we use here the advantages of the qism form .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we apply the general scheme outlined above to construct all @xmath72- and @xmath73-point symmetric correlators , the @xmath74-point correlator for the alternating configuration @xmath75 and the @xmath76-point correlator with the configuration of all signs but one coinciding . by a canonical transformation",
    "the @xmath72-point correlators are mapped to @xmath77-operators . in section 3",
    "we proceed to more involved examples and rewrite the eigenvalue relation for monodromy in the equivalent crossing form that allows to simplify essentially the treatment of the yangian conditions .",
    "we consider the signature configurations @xmath78 and @xmath79 and express the corresponding correlators in terms of the hypergeometric series and in link form .",
    "further , a generalization of the yang - baxter relation is introduced that is intimately related to the crossing version of the monodromy eigenvalue relation . in this case",
    "the symmetric correlators play the role of kernels of yang - baxter operators . in section 4 several discrete transformations of the signature configurations",
    "are introduced relating symmetric correlators of equal length .",
    "we consider the reflection of the signature configuration , the mirror transposition , the cyclic permutation and the transposition of a pair @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then we propose a recurrent procedure that enables one to construct higher - point symmetric correlators sewing lower - point ones with each other as well as to increase the connectivity . in section 5",
    "we summarize .",
