    "quasars are variable in different wavebands , and their variability has been extensively explored for several decades @xcite .",
    "it has been accepted that quasars are powered by black hole accretion , and their variability therefore provides an important clue to understand the physics at work in accretion discs .",
    "the timescales of optical variability for quasars vary from hours to decades .",
    "the variability is found to be correlated with other quasar properties , such as redshift and luminosity .",
    "there is a strong negative correlation of variability with quasar luminosity , while a significant positive correlation between variability and redshift is also present @xcite .",
    "an anti - correlation between variability amplitude and rest - frame wavelength has also been observed , so the correlation between variability and redshift was explained by the selection effect , because quasars at higher redshifts are more easier to be probed in shorter rest - frame wavelength @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite claimed that the evolution of quasar population or the change of quasar variability mechanism can cause quasars to be more variable at higher redshifts based on a sample of over 25,000 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey , which is different from the selection effect scenario .",
    "recently , @xcite matched quasars from the the quasar equatorial survey team phase 1 ( quest1 ) variability survey with broad - line objects from the sloan digital sky survey , which leads to @xmath4 quasars .",
    "the black hole masses of these quasars are estimated from the widths of broad - line @xmath5 .",
    "they measured the variability amplitudes from the quest1 light curves , and found a correlation between quasar variability amplitude and black hole mass .",
    "they found that the correlation seems to be unlikely caused by selection effects or the contamination coming from host galaxy or other well - known correlations .",
    "this correlation between black hole mass and variability amplitude was confirmed by @xcite by using a sample over 2500 quasars .",
    "there were many efforts devoted to reveal the physics behind the correlations between quasar optical - uv variability and other quasar properties .",
    "many different scenarios were suggested , such as , variation of accretion rates , disc instabilities , stellar collisions , and microlensing effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is widely believed that quasars are powered by black hole accretion .",
    "however , the spectral shape in optical - uv bands for a standard thin accretion disc can be approximated as @xmath6 , while the observed quasar continua usually exhibit @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the observed quasar spectra can be reproduced by accretion discs with a temperature gradient of @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 as predicted by standard thin disc model .",
    "this means that there is some flow of heat outwards in the disk .",
    "they use the optical variability timescales of quasars to argue that the variations must propagate at close to the speed of light , rather than on viscous timescales @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the multi - epoch quasar spectra in the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath10 can be fitted by the standard thin disc model , provided their accretion rates vary from one epoch to the next .",
    "thus , it is a reasonable scenario that the variability may be caused by the change of accretion rates .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the variability amplitude of quasars as a function of black hole mass based on accretion disc models assuming the variability to be caused by the change of accretion rates .",
    "we also compare our theoretical calculations with the observed correlations of variability amplitude with other quantities ( i.e. , luminosity or observed wavelength ) .",
    "the big blue bump observed in many agn is believed to be related to some kind of thermal emission @xcite .",
    "the thermal emission of the standard thin accretion disc can reproduce the general features of agn continua , provided some other components , such as an extrapolation of infrared continuum or a power - law x - ray continuum , are included @xcite ( but also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the standard thin disc is geometrically thin , optically thick , and its emission is close to blackbody @xcite .",
    "the gases in the disc rotate at keplerian velocities , and they are in hydrodynamical equilibrium in the vertical direction . the structure of a standard thin disc can be derived analytically ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the temperature distribution of an accretion disc as a function of radius @xmath11 given by @xcite , @xmath12 where , @xmath13 and @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the black hole mass , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the viscosity parameter . the spectrum of the accretion disc can be calculated with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is given by eq .",

    "@xcite suggested that the observed quasar spectra can be reproduced by accretion discs with a temperature gradient of @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 as predicted by standard thin disc model .",
    "thus , we also adopt this modified disc model in our spectral calculations ( this model is referred to as modified accretion disc model hereafter ) . the temperature of the disc is then given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a correction factor used to let the resulted disc luminosity be the same as that for a standard thin disc with the same disc parameters .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the timescales of quasar variability in @xcite range from a few hours to years , which are much shorter than the viscous timescale of the disc , but is usually longer than the light - travel time of the distance to the black hole ( see detailed discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this may imply that the energy propagates at close to the speed of light , rather than on viscous timescales .",
    "thus , the outer disc region is irradiated by the radiation of the inner disc region , and the temperature distribution of the disc is altered significantly as described by the modified accretion disc model .",
    "such a modified disc model can successfully reproduce the steep spectra in optical - uv bands @xcite .",
    "our calculations indicate that the optical variability amplitude declines with luminosity of the accretion disc if it black hole mass is fixed .",
