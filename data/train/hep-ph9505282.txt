    "<S> understanding the pattern of gluon radiation in @xmath0 production processes is important for making an accurate determination of the top mass from the measurement of its decay products . in a recent paper we showed that the exact matrix element and parton shower ( herwig ) calculations gave very different results for the distribution of gluon jets in @xmath0 production at the tevatron @xmath1 collider . by repeating the calculation for the simpler @xmath2 process , </S>",
    "<S> we reveal even more dramatic differences between the two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there are significant differences in gluon radiation between herwig and the matrix element calculation in regions of phase space where one would expect agreement .    dtp/95/38 + ur-1420 + er-40685 - 869 + may 1995 +    1.cm    * on gluon radiation in @xmath3 production and decay * 1.cm lynne h. orr .2 cm _ department of physics , university of rochester + rochester , ny 14627 - 0171 , usa _   </S>",

    "<S> +    having established the existence of the top quark through its production in @xmath1 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , the cdf and d0 collaborations must now accurately measure the top mass . to do </S>",
    "<S> so requires understanding gluon radiation in top events . because top is observed only through its decays , measuring its mass requires reconstructing the momenta of its decay products and comparing measured invariant mass distributions with those predicted by theory . and </S>",
    "<S> because gluons can be radiated in top production _ and _ decay , top events often contain extra jets which may or may not need to be counted among the decay products . while this can not be decided on an event - by - event basis , in principle the problem of extra jets can be dealt with as long as their distributions are properly understood .    in previous work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we studied the distributions of extra jets in @xmath0 production and decay at the tevatron @xmath1 collider . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite we performed a complete tree - level calculation of the process @xmath4 jet @xmath5 , in which we included all contributions from gluons emitted in the production and decay stages as well as all top width effects and spin correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we compared our exact matrix element results to those obtained using the parton - shower monte carlo program herwig @xcite , which is widely used in the experimental analyses . </S>",
    "<S> we found a significant discrepancy between the two calculations . </S>",
    "<S> although we were unable to identify the reason for the discrepancy , the differences in jet distributions seemed to indicate a relative lack of gluons radiated in top decay compared to top production in herwig .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we pursue further the comparison of matrix element ( me ) and parton shower ( ps ) calculations of gluon radiation in top production and decay . in light of the subtle issues associated with making me  </S>",
    "<S> ps comparisons , and of the complications associated with hadronic top production , it is necessary to investigate the differences in a systematic way . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we focus here on the simpler case of @xmath6 collisions , where many of the complications of @xmath1 collisions , such as initial state radiation , are absent , and where a cleaner comparison can be performed . </S>",
    "<S> then , armed with our @xmath6 results , we return to a discussion of the hadronic case .    comparing a fixed order calculation with a full parton shower program </S>",
    "<S> presents several challenges . </S>",
    "<S> most notable is that the me calculation produces only partons directly from the hard process , whereas in the ps calculation , any number of partons can be present as a result of showers , and multiple gluon effects can be important . in order to develop a meaningful method for comparison , we begin by studying the well - understood process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a light quark . </S>",
    "<S> next , we make the same comparison but including a non - zero quark mass ( @xmath9 ) . from these processes </S>",
    "<S> a useful method of comparison is found , and the regions of applicability for the different calculations are studied . </S>",
    "<S> having understood the simpler processes , we then consider @xmath10 via top pair production . </S>",
    "<S> cuts are kept to the minimum necessary to avoid singularities .    in each case , the final state hadrons in the me calculation are two quarks and a single extra gluon ( we ignore the @xmath11 s from top decay ; they can be considered to decay leptonically ) . in the ps calculation </S>",
    "<S> the final state contains two quarks plus any number of showered partons . in order to make the me  ps comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we must use some algorithm to combine showered partons in the ps calculation so that we are left with at most three jets . </S>",
    "<S> quark decays turned off . </S>",
    "<S> ] we use the durham successive combination algorithm @xcite , which has the advantages @xcite that it reproduces lep data well and lends itself to direct comparison with me calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply the durham algorithm as follows . for each pair of partons ( or jets ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we compute the quantity @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy of parton @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the angle between them , and @xmath18 is the process center - of - mass energy . the pair with the smallest @xmath19 are combined into a single jet with four - momentum @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the jet replaces the partons in the @xmath19 computations and we repeat the process until no more than three jets remain . </S>",
    "<S> note that for small angles , the numerator of @xmath19 is simply the @xmath21 of the less energetic parton with respect to the more energetic one . </S>",
    "<S> hence the algorithm causes the partons with the smallest relative transverse momentum to be combined . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the dimensionless variable @xmath22 is somewhat like an angular variable , so that this method is analogous to the angular cone algorithm used in our comparisons for @xmath1 @xcite .    after using the jet algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we have three-`jet ' events from both ps and me calculations , and they can now be compared . to do so , we make further use of the durham variable : for each event , we plot the distribution as a function of the smallest value of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) for all pairings of the remaining three jets . because large values of @xmath24 correspond to large relative @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> _ i.e. _ , large angles and energies , the me and ps results should agree well in this region . </S>",
    "<S> small values of @xmath24 bring us into the soft / collinear regime , where the me result diverges as @xmath26 . in this region </S>",
    "<S> multiple gluon effects become important , and we expect the ps result , which takes these into account via resummation , to remain finite .    </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , which shows the @xmath24 distribution for @xmath7 ( massless quarks ) with a center - of - mass energy of 100  gev . </S>",
    "<S> since we are primarily interested in shapes of distributions , the normalization of the me calculation is chosen ( via the @xmath27 scale ) so that the distributions for @xmath7 agree at large values of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we see , then , that me and ps agree quite well for large @xmath24 , not only in normalization , which we have fixed , but in shape , which we are not free to manipulate . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath24 decreases , the me distribution rises , diverging as @xmath28 , but we see the multigluon effects begin to show in the ps curve , which turns over and remains finite .    the effect of giving the final quark a mass is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) for the process @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath30 mass has weakened the me divergence , and the distribution for all @xmath24 is less steep than in the massless case . </S>",
    "<S> the ps calculation again reproduces the me result ( including the rounding due to the mass ) quite well in the large @xmath24 region , and we see the two results begin to disagree as multigluon effects come in for smaller @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> satisfied that we understand the above simple cases , we turn to top production . </S>",
    "<S> the me and ps calculations performed here for @xmath6 production of top are similar to those performed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath31 gev . to obtain the me results we have performed an exact parton - level calculation of @xmath10 , including top width effects , using helicity amplitudes generated by the madgraph @xcite package . </S>",
    "<S> the ps results were obtained using herwig @xcite ( v5.8 ) , with hadronization and @xmath30 quark decays switched off . as in the case of hadronic top production </S>",
    "<S> , we do not consider radiation off the @xmath11 decay products , and the @xmath11 s can be considered to decay leptonically .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed with the jet algorithm as above , and compare the me and ps @xmath24 distributions for center - of - mass energy 420 gev in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> production in @xmath32 collisions at the tevatron . ] </S>",
    "<S> the difference is quite dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> the me curve displays further rounding as one might expect from a higher mass quark or from the lack of correlation between the final state @xmath30 quarks and gluons radiated from the @xmath33 or @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the ps curve is unexpected . </S>",
    "<S> we see the usual turn - over at small values of @xmath24 , but the large @xmath24 behavior is surprising . </S>",
    "<S> not only does ps not reproduce me ; its shape is so different that there is no shift in normalization that would cause the two to agree .    </S>",
    "<S> given that the matrix element calculation is of fixed order in perturbation theory , one expects that its region of validity would start at large values of @xmath24 and extend to the left to the region where we expect multiple gluon emissions to become important . since the parton shower has these multiple emissions , but uses an angular ordering algorithm , we expect its region of validity to be from small values of @xmath24 and extend to the right . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that there is almost no region of overlap is very disturbing .    </S>",
    "<S> we have been unable to pin down the reason for the above discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> although it is in principle difficult to compare fixed order ( me ) with approximate all - orders ( ps ) calculations , the fact that the comparison works well for _ light _ </S>",
    "<S> quarks suggests that this is not the explanation for the difference . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is no reason why a matrix element calculation which works well for light quarks should fail for heavy quarks , provided of course that appropriate cuts are used to avoid the soft and collinear regions . following the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it has been suggested @xcite that the observed differences between the ps and me calculations were due to a choice of cuts in the latter that were too sensitive to the infra - red region , thus implying that important higher - order multi - gluon contributions were missing from the me calculation . however </S>",
    "<S> ( see below ) increasing the jet @xmath35 cut in the calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and thus moving to a phase - space region where the me approach should work even better , does not resolve the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore forced to conclude that the implementation of very heavy quark production and/or decay in herwig may not be correct . </S>",
    "<S> one can perhaps shed further light on this by comparing the two calculations for _ stable _ top production , thus testing the ` production ' part of the jet cross section in each case . </S>",
    "<S> the result of such a comparison is shown in fig .  3 , where the distribution in @xmath24 is shown for stable @xmath36  gev @xmath37 production in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath38  gev . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( essentially the same distribution but for light quarks ) , there is a marked difference between the two calculations in the medium - small @xmath24 region . note that in this case there is no collinear singularity and so the divergence as @xmath26 is weaker ( @xmath39 ) in the me distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to see how higher - order multi - gluon contributions could produce such a pronounced _ increase _ at @xmath40 in the ps calculation . by comparing figs .  2 and 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the difference in the ` production ' part can also be seen in the full ` production @xmath41 decay ' distribution .    finally , we return to the case of hadronic top production . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the discrepancy we found in @xcite is similar to that observed in @xmath6 collisions ( fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> essentially it amounts to a relative deficit of decay stage radiation in the ps calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is both enhanced and clarified in the study in @xmath6 because of the lack of initial state radiation , and the cleaner environment . as a final confirmation of this fact , we replot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 the distributions in the phase - space separation variable @xmath42 in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath43  tev from the me and ps ( herwig ) calculations , with a very large cut on the transverse energy of the jets . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level me calculation should certainly be a good approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again we observe a large discrepancy between herwig and the matrix element calculation . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to estimate the effect of this difference on top quark analyses , and in particular on the measurement of the top mass , but clearly every effort should be made to ensure that the event simulators used to study the top quark do indeed constitute a good approximation to the underlying physics .    </S>",
