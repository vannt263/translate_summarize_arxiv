    "kondo @xcite showed that multiple scattering of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity yields a divergent contribution to the resistance in perturbation theory .",
    "kondo s paper stimulated a large body of theoretical and experimental work which changed our understanding of d- and f - impurities completely ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of sophisticated methods were applied in the following three decades to better understand and solve the kondo and friedel - anderson problems . in particular",
    ", it was shown that at zero temperature the friedel - anderson impurity is in a non - magnetic state . to name a few of these methods : scaling @xcite , renormalization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite fermi - liquid theory @xcite , @xcite , slave - bosons",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , large - spin limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after decades of research exact solutions of the kondo and friedel - anderson impurities were derived with help of the bethe - ansatz @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , representing a magnificent theoretical achievement .",
    "the experimental and theoretical progress has been collected in a large number of review articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the exact theory of the bethe ansatz is such a complex theory that only a limited number of parameters can be calculated . for the majority of practical problems one uses the numerical renormalization group ( * nrg * ) theory and the large - spin ( large @xmath1 ) method .",
    "recently the author introduced another approximate solution for the friedel - anderson ( fa ) @xcite , @xcite and the kondo impurity @xcite , the fair method .",
    "the fair solution consists of only four to eight slater states and is therefore very compact .",
    "it is well suited to calculate in particular spatial properties of the kondo ground state .",
    "it yields the first quantitative calculations of the kondo cloud @xcite .",
    "there are very few spatial properties of the kondo ground state calculated with other theoretical approaches .",
    "one example is the nrg calculation for the friedel oscillations in the vicinity of a kondo impurity @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the friedel oscillations with the fair method yields good agreement with the nrg results @xcite . in this short review",
    "the fair method will be introduced and some of the results presented .",

    "the s - band hamiltonian has the form @xmath19 one recognizes that this hamiltonian is analogous to a friedel hamiltonian where @xmath6 represents an artificial friedel resonance .",
    "therefore this state is called a fair state for * * f**riedel * * a**rtificially * * i**nserted * * r**esonance state .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the fair state @xmath6 can have any composition of the basis states @xmath3 .",
    "therefore it can be adjusted to a given problem without any restriction .",

    "@xmath21 \\label{h_fr}\\ ] ] since @xmath22 does not depend on the spin the latter will be ignored .",
    "the first term is the conduction band hamiltonian @xmath23 the second term gives the energy of the d ( resonance ) state of the impurity with @xmath24 being its creation operator .",
    "the last term represents the interaction between the d state and the conduction electrons .",
    "there exists a fair state @xmath6 and a fair basis @xmath25 so that the @xmath26-electron ground state of the friedel hamiltonian is exactly given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are coefficients which fulfill the condition @xmath30 .",
