    "quantum transport in semiconductors has attracted a great deal of interest over the last few decades .",
    "the transport theory of carriers in bulk semiconductors as developed on the basis of semiclassical boltzmann or balance equations as well as the nonequilibrium green s function ( gf ) technique is well documented in many review articles and textbooks ( cf .",
    ", for instance , refs .",
    "[ ] ) and has reached a high level of sophistication . compared with this achievement , there are only a few studies on quantum diffusion in semiconductors .",
    "however , this fact does not imply that the knowledge about quantum diffusion has not contributed to the overall picture of quantum kinetics .",
    "it is rather the unified description of ballistic transport , diffusion , and hopping that provides valuable insight into the general structure of the theory .",
    "this paper aims at the construction of a general transport theory by focusing on common features that emerge from quantum transport and quantum diffusion as well as from transport via extended and localized states . a comparative analysis of quantum transport and quantum diffusion , carried out on the basis of a semi - phenomenological approach , @xcite clearly stressed distinct features of the general theory that already appeared in early studies of the current density .",
    "@xcite the problem is best explained by treating the momentum representation of the one - particle transport approach .",
    "it is usually assumed that due to translational invariance the carrier transport in homogeneous systems is properly accounted for by only one @xmath0 vector .",
    "consequently , the carrier transport should be governed by the distribution function @xmath1 , which is the solution of a quantum - kinetic equation .",
    "however , completely different results were obtained from a unified approach to quantum transport and quantum diffusion on the basis of the conditional transition probability that satisfies a quantum - mechanical bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "@xcite the main quantity in this approach is the distribution function @xmath2 that depends on both wave vectors , although the underlying model is completely homogeneous and not strongly affected by special initial conditions .",
    "this finding is all the more surprising since the vector @xmath3 refers to a deviation from homogeneity .",
    "in fact , it is not the full @xmath3 dependence that is needed in the calculation of transport coefficients of homogeneous bulk semiconductors .",
    "what enters the approach is the quantity @xmath4 , which is interpreted to be a virtual disturbance of the homogeneous system that allows to probe the drift - diffusion response .",
    "the surprising result that both wave vectors @xmath0 and @xmath3 appear also in the general transport theory of homogeneous systems is confirmed by the unified picture of transport via extended and localized states . in principle , hopping and band transport can be described on the same footing so that each approach is derivable from the other one in a straightforward manner .",
    "this equivalence is of particular importance , when transport in biased superlattices is treated . by tuning the electric field applied perpendicular to the layers of the superlattice",
    ", the character of transport can be driven from hopping to the ohmic regime and vice versa . from an application point of view",
    ", however , it is natural to expect that both approaches are not equally well adapted for numerical purposes .    to provide further arguments for",
    "the statement that also the vector @xmath3 enters the general transport theory , let us focus on the current density @xmath5 , which is given by the time derivative of the dipole operator @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the volume of the system ) .",
    "in the momentum representation , an equivalent form applicable to the steady state is obtained by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes an effective velocity . in the majority of transport studies",
    ", @xmath9 is simply given by the drift velocity @xmath10 that refers to extended states with the kinetic energy @xmath11 .",
    "this result applies , whenever the interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 commutes with the dipole operator , which , however , does not always happen .",
    "for instance , in the theory of small polarons , there is an extra current contribution @xmath13_{-}$ ] , which even dominates the carrier transport via the effective drift velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the current density of this kind is expressed by the @xmath3 derivative of the collision integral calculated at @xmath14 .",
    "another example refers to the proper definition of the spin current in semiconductors with spin - orbit interaction that recently became a subject of a lively controversial discussion .",
    "@xcite in addition , the exact switching from band to hopping transport and vice versa requires the consideration of both momenta @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the scattering terms and gfs .",
    "@xcite    the former semi - phenomenological studies provided a unified approach to quantum transport and quantum diffusion that covers transport via localized and extended states .",
    "@xcite it remains the task to put this suggestive transport picture on a firm microscopic foundation .",
    "the most attractive starting point for this purpose provides the nonequilibrium gf technique that was initiated by schwinger @xcite and keldysh @xcite and that has been employed by several authors @xcite to treat quantum transport . with respect to the time dependence ,",
    "such a fundamental approach is able to cope with the two - time nature of quantum evolution .",
    "the double - time character manifests itself in coupled evolution equations for the spectral function and the statistical propagator .",
    "moreover , memory effects appear due to the integration over the full time history . unfortunately , most applications of the nonequilibrium gf method disregarded the entangled time dependence by relying on a sufficient homogeneity in time , which is exploited by first - order gradient expansions , when center of mass coordinates in space and time slowly vary .",
    "this approximation has a serious disadvantage , namely it rules out the full quantum - mechanical character of transport phenomena .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , we account for the two - time dependence of gfs in an exact manner and generalize our former unified approach to quantum transport and quantum diffusion .",
    "@xcite the basic quantity will be the two - time distribution function @xmath15 that satisfies a quantum - kinetic equation .",
    "an example , given in the last section , demonstrates the existence of a macroscopic phononless quantum transport mechanism that emerges only , when the double - time dependence of gfs is properly taken into account .",
    "we are going to focus on the basic physics of quantum transport that is revealed by controlled approximations in a one - particle picture that disregards the coulomb interaction between carriers .",
    "consequently , the electron - phonon interaction takes over the indispensable role of an inelastic scattering mechanism , which is needed when treating the nonlinear high - field transport . in spite of this restriction",
    ", we will , nevertheless , consider a rather general model that is compatible with many studies of quantum transport in semiconductors .",
    "the main issue in deriving basic quantum - kinetic equations is the full account of symmetries .",
    "although the translational invariance with respect to the spatial @xmath16 and temporal @xmath17 coordinates is broken , when external electric @xmath18 and magnetic @xmath19 fields are applied to the sample , there remains a symmetry of gfs that is very important for the description of field - dependent nonequilibrium quantum transport .",
    "@xcite this symmetry expresses the fact that a translation of spatial coordinates can be compensated by the vector potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the external magnetic and time - dependent electric field , respectively . for the expectation values of the one - particle propagators",
    "@xmath22 , we have @xmath23 with the abbreviations @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the vector potential of the magnetic field @xmath20 is given in the symmetric gauge . the symmetry expressed by eq .",

    ", for instance , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ seq2 ] ) leads to simplifications that are most effectively exploited in fourier space . changing the coordinates according to @xmath30 we perform a fourier transformation with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 to obtain @xmath33 with @xmath34 the reduction of degrees of freedom and the separation of the momentum @xmath3 become more transparent in the absence of a magnetic field , when eq .",

    "is absent in the conventional treatment of transport in homogeneous systems .",
    "a nonequilibrium system is completely characterized by only two independent two - point functions . from a physical point of view , the decomposition of the full matrix of gfs into statistical and spectral components is most attractive due to its clear physical interpretation and due to the unambiguous separation of their dynamical role . loosely speaking , this choice of gfs makes clear which states are available and how often they are occupied . having this natural decomposition in mind , we derive kinetic equations for the gfs @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which effectively yield the density of states and the double - time density matrix , respectively . in the momentum representation ,",
