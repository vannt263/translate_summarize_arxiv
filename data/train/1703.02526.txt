    "recently , a number of authors have investigated the assouad and lower - assouad dimensions of subsets of @xmath4 ; see @xcite and the many papers referenced there .",
    "these dimensions differ from the well - known hausdorff and box dimensions as they provide information about the extreme behaviour of the local geometry of the set .",
    "the quasi - assouad dimensions give less extreme , but still local , geometric information . as in the case of assouad dimensions , quasi - assouad dimensions",
    "take into account relative scales locally at any position in the set , but the difference is that the ` minimal depth ' of the relative scales increases as the size of the considered neighbour decreases , and this has a moderating effect .",
    "these dimensions were introduced by l and xi in @xcite and shown to be an invariant quantity under quasi - lipschitz maps , unlike the assouad dimension . in this note , we develop further properties of the quasi - assouad dimensions .    to give their definitions we first introduce notation . for a subset @xmath5 ,",
    "let @xmath6 be the least number of balls of radius @xmath7 needed to cover @xmath8 and let @xmath9 .",
    "the upper and lower box dimensions , denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , are given by @xmath12if the two values coincide , we refer to it as the box dimension , @xmath13 .",
    "given @xmath14 , define @xmath15and @xmath16these functions are monotone and by taking limits we obtain the quasi - assouad dimension of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the quasi - lower assouad dimension of @xmath17 , @xmath19 : @xmath20the assouad and the lower - assouad dimensions are given by @xmath21    for any set @xmath17 these dimensions are ordered in the following way : @xmath22it is known that all these dimensions coincide for self - similar sets satisfying the open set condition , but for more general sets , strict inequalities are possible throughout , c.f .",

    "also recently introduced the following refined parametric variants for @xmath23 , known as the assouad spectrum and lower spectrum of @xmath17 respectively : @xmath24@xmath25 in general , @xmath26for all such @xmath27 ( @xcite ) and unknown if @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in section 2 of this note , we consider limit sets of suitably controlled moran constructions in @xmath0 , a class which includes the family of self - similar and more generally , self - conformal , sets . in @xcite , fraser proved that self - conformal sets have the same lower - assouad and box dimension .",
    "however , he gave an example of a self - similar set @xmath30 @xmath0 with @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , we prove that the quasi - assouad dimension and upper box dimension of these limit sets always agree . this shows , in particular , that the assouad spectrum and lower spectrum of self - conformal sets in @xmath0 coincide with their box dimension for every @xmath23 , regardless of separation conditions , and answers ( for the case of @xmath0 ) a question posed by fraser and yu in @xcite .",
    "the equality of these dimensions also holds for certain self - similar carpets in @xmath32 , but it is unknown if the result is true , in general , even for self - similar sets in higher dimensions .",
    "the so - called tangents of a set are a  useful concept when considering the assouad dimension .",
    "these are essentially limits , in the hausdorff metric , of sequences of magnifications of local parts of the set .",
    "tangents often have simpler structure than the original set and their assouad dimensions are always lower bounds for the assouad dimension of the original set ( @xcite ) . in section 3 , we show that if the convergence to the tangent is sufficiently fast , and the lower - assouad and assouad dimension of the tangent coincide , then this value is a lower ( upper ) bound for the quasi-(lower ) assouad dimension of the original set . from this , we show that the quasi-(lower ) assouad dimensions of self - affine carpets are the same as their assouad dimensions .    in section 4",
    "we observe that if @xmath33 , then the same is true for the quasi - assouad ( but not necessarily , the assouad ) dimension of @xmath17 and show that the quasi - assouad dimension of a sequence in @xmath0 with decreasing gaps is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 . this same dichotomy was shown to hold for assouad dimensions ( although not necessarily with the same value for the assouad and quasi - assaoud dimensions ) in @xcite .",
    "we also give an example to illustrate that , like the assouad dimension ( but not the hausdorff or box dimensions ) , the quasi - assouad dimension can rise when taking projections .",
