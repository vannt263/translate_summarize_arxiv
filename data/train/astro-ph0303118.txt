    "the sgr b2 complex represents an interesting burst of massive star formation in the inner 400 pc of the galaxy ( that we refer as the galactic center region [ gc ] ) and may be representative of other active nuclei .",
    "large scale continuum emission studies show that sgr b2 is the brightest emission and the most massive cloud of the region ( @xmath610@xmath12 m@xmath13 ; lis & goldsmith 1989 ) .",
    "the main signposts of star activity are located within three dust condensations labelled as sgr b2(n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) .",
    "they contain all the tracers of on  going star formation : ultracompact hii regions driven by the uv field of newly born @xmath14 stars , hot cores embedding proto ",
    "stars , molecular masers and high far  ir continuum intensity .",
    "these _ core _ regions are surrounded by a low density ( n@xmath15@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath8 ) extended envelope ( @xmath915@xmath18 ) , hereafter sgr b2 envelope , of warm gas ( t@xmath19@xmath20200 k ) and cool dust ( t@xmath21=20 - 30 k ; httemeister et al .",
    "a summary of the different components present in sgr b2 and their main characteristics is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] [ _ left _ ] .",
    "the origin of the observed rich chemistry in the sgr b2 envelope and its possible heating mechanisms are far from settled and several scenarios have been proposed .",
    "velocity shocks have been traditionally invoked to explain the enhanced abundances of sio or nh@xmath22 and the differences between gas and dust temperatures ( cf .",
    "flower et al .",
    "the origin of shocks in the sgr b2 envelope have been associated either with large scale cloud  cloud collisions or with small scale wind  blown bubbles produced by evolve massive stars ( martn  pintado et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the effect of the uv radiation in the sgr b2 envelope has been traditionally ruled out because of the gas and dust temperature differences , the unusual chemistry and the abscense of thermal radio - continuum and ionized gas outside the hii regions and hot cores within the central condensations .",
    "our observations reveal the presence of an extended component of ionized gas detected by fine structure emission .",
    "all this new data suggest that uv radiative  type processes are also important in the heating of the gc gas in addition to mechanical mechanisms , as can be in other gc clouds ( see rodrguez - fernndez et al .",

    "the large h@xmath24 column density ( up to 10@xmath25 @xmath26 ) found in sgr b2 suggests that even in the far  ir , fine structure lines can suffer appreciable reddening .",
    "we have estimated the prevailing extinction in each position by converting the continuum opacity into visual extinction .",
    "the spectra can not be fitted with a single gray body .",
    "thus , we have modeled the observed continuum spectrum as a sum of two gray bodies .",
    "the total continuum flux in the model is : @xmath27 where b@xmath28(t@xmath29 ) is the planck function , @xmath30 is the continuum opacity and @xmath31 is the solid angle subtended by the @xmath32 dust component .",
    "the continuum opacity is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the grain emissivity exponent of each dust component .",
    "the observed spectral energy distributions are best fitted with a dust component with a temperature of 1322 k and a warmer component with a temperature of 2439 k. the warmer component contribute in less than 10 % to the total optical depth .",
    "the higher dust temperatures are those measured in the southern part of sgr b2 .",
    "depending of the position , the derived extinction varies from @xmath920 to @xmath91000 magnitudes ( see table [ ratios ] for lower and upper limits to the visual extinction ) .",
    "the far  ir spectra exhibit several fine structure lines from the ionized material .",
    "we have clearly detected the [ oi]63 and 145 @xmath3 m , and [ cii]158 @xmath3 m lines in all observed positions .",
    "in addition , lines coming from the [ nii]122 @xmath3 m , [ niii]57 @xmath3 m [ oiii]52 and 88 @xmath3 m lines are also detected in most positions , revealing a prominent component of ionized gas in the southern and eastern regions of sgr b2 .",
    "table 1 lists the extinction corrected oiii 52/88 line intensity ratios for the two derived limits to the extinction across the region . for extended emission sources and lines excited by collisions with electrons ( see rubin et al .",
    "1994 ) we derive electron densities ( n@xmath5 ) in the range @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 for the extended envelope . at the limited spectral resolution of the lws / grating mode ,",

    "perot detection in sgr b2(m ) .",
    "both oiii lines appear centered at v@xmath35@xmath650@xmath3615 km s@xmath37 and do not show emission / absorption at more negative velocities ( foreground gas ) .",
    "considering a@xmath38@xmath391000 magnitudes , we found n@xmath5@xmath2010@xmath40 @xmath8 in sgr b2(m ) .",
    "table 1 also lists the extinction corrected niii57/nii122 line intensity ratios .",
    "the minimum averaged ratio is @xmath41 while the upper limits are dependent to the maximum extinction affecting the lines . for those ratios ,",
    "we derive minimum effective temperatures ( t@xmath42 ) for the ionizing radiation of @xmath43 .",
    "those t@xmath42 should be considered as a lower limit to the actual t@xmath42 of the ionizing source if this is located far from the nebular gas .",
    "we have carried out cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) simulations showing that the observed line ratios are consistent with an scenario where almost all ionizing photons arise from the hii regions within sgr b2(m ) and ( n ) .",
    "the total flux of lyman continuum photons is 10@xmath44 s@xmath37 and t@xmath45 .",
    "the differences in the observed niii / nii ratios are due to the dilution of the incident radiation ( lower ionization parameter ) .",
    "hence , the size of the ionized region can only be explained if the medium is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "this suggests that the clumpy nature of the cloud allows the radiation to reach large distances through the envelope . in this scenario , several pdrs",
    "can be expected in the interface between the ionized and the neutral gas .    .selected line ratios after correcting for the estimated minimum and maximum extiction .",

    "the large oh column density of warm ( t@xmath19@xmath6300 k ) and low density gas ( n@xmath15@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath8 ) recently found in the envelope of sgr b2 suggested that its external shells are illuminated by a strong far  uv field that photodissociate the large amount of water vapor found in the region ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ) .",
    "however , the main properties of the associated warm pdrs could not be derived . for that porpose ,",
    "we have compared the far  ir continuum emission , and the [ cii ] 158 , [ oi]63 and 145 @xmath3 m lines at each position with pdr theoretical models .",
    "figure 2d shows our results in comparison with predictions from pdr models of wolfire , tielens and hollenbach ( 1990 ) .",
    "the gray squares show the parameter space occupied by the sgr b2 positions for intensity ratios corrected for the minimum ( filled ) and maximum ( not filled ) visual extinction estimated from the continuum analysis .",
    "the observational points scatter around a far  uv flux , g@xmath10 , of @xmath610@xmath11 and n@xmath47@xmath610@xmath11 @xmath8 depending on the use of all observed cii flux ( dark gray ) or the remaining cii flux after subtracting the cii emission arising in ( non  pdr ) low  density ionized gas and correlated with the nii emission . from the observed correlation ( see fig .",
    "2c ) we estimate that 20 to 70 % of the cii emission arises in the pdrs of sgr b2 .",
    "in addition , both the observed [ cii]158/[oi]63 and ( [ cii]158+[oi]63)/fir intensity ratios shown in fig .",
    "2d are not predicted by shocked gas models ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) while they are commonly reproduced in pdr models .",
    "we have presented new far  ir observations of the sgr b2 region that reveal a new perspective of the less known extended envelope of the complex .",
    "the iso data show the presence of a widespread component of ionized gas reaching very large distances from the hii regions of known massive star formation .",
    "molecular tracers and atomic fine structure tracers do not show evidences of high  velocity shocks .",
    "hence , the ionized gas can not be explained in terms of high  velocity dissociative shocks .",
    "it seems that the well established widespread low  velocity shocks are not the only mechanism heating the gas to temperatures larger than those of the dust .",
    "we now have proofs showing that low - velocity shocks and large scale radiative processes , such as the photoelectric effect , coexist in the whole sgr b2 envelope , difficulting the interpretation of the astronomical data but providing one of the richest and peculiar clouds in the galaxy .",
    "coexistence of mechanical and radiative  type heating mechanisms based on the effects of a far  uv field that permeates an inhomogeneous and clumpy medium seems to be the rule in the envelope of sgr b2 and in the bulk of gc clouds observed by iso ( rodrguez - fernndez et al .",
