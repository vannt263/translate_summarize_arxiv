    "low mass stars form by gravitational collapse of dense cores in molecular clouds .",
    "the collapse is believed to proceed from a condensed initial state ( larson 1969 , shu 1977 ) with a rapid development of a system consisting of a protostellar core which accretes mass from a disk and envelope .",
    "this gravitational collapse model can now be explored through detailed observations and numerical calculations .",
    "observational studies of star - forming infall are indispensable to understand the kinematics of gravitational collapse onto young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "this , in turn , is essential to study the origin of the initial mass function and of multiple systems .",
    "observations are now beginning to probe a variety of size scales , density and temperature regimes in many sources .    in recent years",
    ", millimeter - wavelength observations have increased the evidence for infall motions onto nearby ysos .",
    "the main procedure is to observe spectral lines that trace high densities ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) and have red - shifted self - absorption spatially concentrated around an embedded yso . the spatial concentration and the use of dense gas tracers are important to ensure that the observed kinematic signature is associated with the yso . for instance , zhou et al .",
    "( 1993 ) mapped the globule b335 in the @xmath1 and @xmath10 optically thick lines of h@xmath0co and in the optically thin lines of c@xmath11o @xmath4 and c@xmath12s @xmath2 .",
    "they reproduced the line profiles on spatial scales of 0.02  pc from the source with an inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "choi et al .  (",
    "1995 ) modeled the same b335 observations with a monte carlo radiative transfer code ( bernes 1979 ) , confirming the numerical results from zhou et al.(1993 ) .",
    "later zhou ( 1995 ) modeled the observed h@xmath0co and cs line profiles toward iras 16293 - 2422 as arising from a combination of infall and rotation , using the terebey , shu & cassen ( 1984 ) collapse model .",
    "the case for infall motions in these sources is strong because of the detailed observations and modeling that has been done on them .",
    "however , in such a small sample of candidates , peculiarities of source structure and kinematics ( eg , outflows or rotation ) could possibly account for the apparent signatures of infall .",
    "therefore , these well studied cases are not sufficient by themselves to support a claim for observed infall motions onto a wide class of sources .",
    "another approach to search for infall evidence is to observe a statistically large sample of sources in two lines tracing high density gas , one optically thick and the other optically thin .",
    "in such a sample , rotation and bipolar outflow motions having symmetry axes in random orientations would tend to produce optically thick line profiles with equal numbers of red - shifted and blue - shifted self - absorption . on the other hand , infall motions in centrally concentrated regions",
    "would only produce red - shifted self - absorption in the line profiles ( leung & brown 1977 ) .",
    "a spectral line survey of a large source sample should reveal whether there is a statistically significant excess of sources with red - shifted or blue - shifted self - absorption .",
    "this approach does not depend much on the details of the models , but mainly on whether there is a prevalence of inward or outward motions . at the same time such a study can yield a list of collapse candidates for further detailed studies .",
    "recent surveys aimed to find candidate collapsing ysos include mardones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) which used the c@xmath13h@xmath0 @xmath14 line ; wang et al .",

    "( 1997 ) which used hco@xmath3 43 and 32 lines in a sample of class 0 sources ( andre , ward - thompson & barsony 1993 ) .",
    "none of these surveys has emphasized the statistical properties of the samples because of the limited number of targets observed .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a molecular line survey toward 47 of the reddest nearby ysos , more than twice the number of sources in any of the previous surveys . in section 2",
    "we discuss our source selection criteria , the molecular lines and the telescopes we used . in section 3",
    "we describe the normalized velocity difference ( @xmath15 ) between the peaks of optically thick and thin lines , as a quantitative measure of the line profiles .",
    "we then analyze statistically the distribution of @xmath15 for different molecular lines and source subsamples . in section 4",
    "we interpret the statistics kinematically .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the sources were selected solely based on their observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and estimated distance from the sun in order to be unbiased with respect to prior knowledge of their molecular line shapes . to select the youngest sources ( best infall candidates ) we used the bolometric temperature",
    "(; myers , & ladd 1993 ) whenever known , otherwise estimated   based on iras and submm continuum observations .",
    "is defined as the temperature of a black body with the same mean frequency as the source spectrum .",
    "chen et al.(1995 ) found that class 0 sources have @xmath16  k , and class i sources ( lada & wilking 1984 ) have @xmath17  k. we imposed a limit of @xmath18  k to select the most embedded class i and class 0 sources .",
    "we relied mostly on the papers by ladd , lada , & myers ( 1993 ) in perseus and chen et al.(1995 , 1996 ) in the taurus , ophiuchus , chamaeleon , lupus and corona australis star forming clouds for determination of .",
    "chen et al .  required the source fluxes to be known in at least 6 different wavelengths in order to compute accurate values of .",
    "that condition is easily met by most iras sources which have also been detected at optical or near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "however , many of the most embedded class i sources and most class 0 sources do not satisfy that requirement .",
    "only a handful of class 0 sources have been observed in enough different mm and submm wavelengths to make a good determination of   possible ( eg .",
    "b335 and l1527 , ladd et al .",
    "we therefore added sources to our list based on more relaxed criteria in order to have a larger sample of the youngest known nearby ysos .",
    "we required iras point sources in our sample to have rising spectra between 25 and 100 @xmath19 m ( with flux ratios 24 for wavelength pairs of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 m ) , and to be located close to the centers of their parent molecular cloud core maps .",
    "these conditions are necessary to exclude galactic cirrus and extragalactic objects which may have high @xmath22 m flux ratios",
    ". we also added sources with known bright mm or submm continuum emission , and nearby class 0 sources known to us by mid 1995 .",
    "we consulted casali et al.(1992 ) for submm continuum observations in serpens , and henning et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and reipurth et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for submm continuum observations toward southern pms stars .",
    "we also consulted persi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , carvallo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and bourke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for iras and near - infrared observations of southern pms stars , many of them located in bok globules .",
    "we determined   for all the sources detected in at least three different wavelengths to include sources not quoted in chen et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the derived values of   for sources with poor wavelength coverage are upper limits if they lack long wavelength fluxes , and lower limits if they lack short wavelength fluxes . because of our selection criteria , we are confident that @xmath5  k in all sources in our sample . to determine a representative systematic error in   in sources with poor short wavelength spectral coverage , we determined   including and excluding wavelengths shorter than 60 @xmath19 m in sources with good spectral coverage .",
    "we found that the error in   when neglecting wavelengths shorter than 60 @xmath19 m is typically @xmath23  k for sources having @xmath24  k. our determination of   is consistent with the values given by gregersen et al.(1997 ) also with limited wavelength coverage .",
    "table [ tsources ] lists all the sources detected in at least one optically thin and one optically thick line .",
    "columns 1 and 2 identify the source , columns 3 and 4 list the observed coordinates ( b1950.0 ) , column 5 lists the distance from the sun in pc , column 6 lists , and column 7 the number n@xmath25 of continuum fluxes used to derive .",
    "we give lower or upper limits to   rather than values for the sources iras 03282 + 3035 , hh211 mm , vla1623 , and s68n due to lack of wavelength coverage close to the peak of their spectral energy distributions .",
    "although these estimates are crude , they are sufficient for our analysis in section 3 , since we only need to know whether   is below 70  k or not .",
    "column 8 lists the references we consulted to determine values of .",
    "finally , column 9 indicates whether there is outflow evidence from the source either as high velocity molecular line wings ( co ) or as shock fronts ( hh ) .    even though we did not use the outflow properties as a source selection criterion",
    ", 87% of the sources in table [ tsources ] actually show evidence of driving an outflow .",
    "this is expected when selecting the most embedded sources , since they tend to drive strong molecular outflows ( bontemps et al.1996 ) .",
    "yso outflow models usually require mass infall onto an accretion disk ( see references in bachiller 1996 ) , so there is reason to expect that most sources in this survey must have infalling envelopes . however , we emphasize that in this paper we are seeking to examine direct kinematic evidence for infall motions onto the sources .",
    "we did not detect 19 of the sources from our initial target list in either the h@xmath0co line , the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line , or both .",
    "table [ tnodet ] lists the positions and rms noise ( main beam brightness temperature ) of the undetected lines for reference .",
    "we detected the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line toward the sources iras 11436 - 6017 and gss30 - 1 , but it was too weak for a good velocity and width determination ( peak @xmath26 of 0.15 and 0.3  k respectively ) .",
    "we note that the average   of these sources in table [ tnodet ] is higher than that of the detected sources listed in table [ tsources ] .",
    "in fact , sources with @xmath27  k in table [ tsources ] were easily detected in all the observed lines .",
    "it is important to observe both optically thick and optically thin lines in order to distinguish double - peak profiles produced by optical depth effects from those due to two velocity components along the line of sight .",
    "the observed molecules should have a high dipole moment in order to be sensitive to the high density gas in the immediate neighborhood of the yso and not to the more extended , lower density gas surrounding the parent cores .",
    "also , the molecular species should be abundant in molecular cloud cores , but unaffected by peculiar chemistry effects .",
    "for example , sio and ch@xmath13oh are well known for their enhanced abundances by many orders of magnitude in the outflow lobes of some ysos ( e.g.  bachiller 1996 ) , presumably due to desorption of molecules from grain mantles in shock fronts .    following these criteria , we chose the cs ( @xmath28 debye ) and h@xmath0co ( @xmath29 debye ) molecules to carry out the survey observations .",
    "h@xmath0co was our first choice molecule , following the example of zhou et al .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath0co is known to be only moderately enhanced in bipolar outflows ( bachiller , & prez 1997 ) .",
    "we subsequently observed part of the survey in the cs molecule in order to check that our results were not being biased by peculiar chemistry in low mass star forming regions .",
    "we believe the cs and h@xmath0co lines are generally optically thick because of the observed brightness temperatures and line shapes . in a few cases , when the line is weak ( t@xmath30  k ) and approximately of gaussian shape",
    ", it is likely to be optically thin ( eg .",
    "l673a , 04325 + 2402 , l1172 ; see figs .",
    "[ fclass0],[fclassi ] ) .",
    "ideally , one would observe an isotope of the optically thick tracer molecule as the optically thin tracer .",
    "then both lines would probe the same density , temperature and chemistry , and would be observed with essentially the same angular resolution .",
    "however , the 2-mm h@xmath31co and the 3-mm c@xmath12s lines are in general too weak for accurate determination of line velocities in a large source sample .",
    "we chose to observe the n@xmath0h@xmath3 j=@xmath4 line instead ( @xmath32 debye ) .",
    "this molecule has seven hyperfine components , in two groups of three lines and one isolated component ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "caselli , myers , & thaddeus ( 1995 ) determined the frequencies of all components with a precision of 6  khz ( 0.02 ) .",
    "the hyperfine structure of n@xmath0h@xmath3 also permits a determination of the optical depth in the line , thus , allowing an internal check on the thinness of the isolated n@xmath0h@xmath3 @xmath34 line .",
    "caselli et al",
    ".  showed that among the seven components , only two show any evidence of anomalous excitation ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , and that these anomalies represent a departure of @xmath37 from the value expected in lte .",
    "any such small anomaly in hyperfine line ratios is included in the estimated uncertainty of the optical depth .",
    "this uncertainty is generally much smaller than the estimated optical depths .",
    "womack , ziurys , & wyckoff ( 1992 ) found that the n@xmath0h@xmath3 j= @xmath4 line is narrow in dark clouds , with no evidence of line wings .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line - widths and hyperfine components make it an ideal probe of the systemic velocity toward young stellar objects .",
    "we used the iram 30-m telescope in pico veleta , spain , in 1995 , may 1012 .",
    "we observed simultaneously in the 2 and 3 mm atmospheric windows with receivers tuned to the ortho h@xmath0co @xmath1 ( 140.839518 ghz ) and n@xmath0h@xmath3 @xmath34 ( 93.176265 ghz ) lines respectively .",
    "the line rest frequencies were taken from lovas ( 1991 ) and caselli et al ( 1995 ) respectively .",

    ", the n@xmath0h@xmath3 @xmath34 line is very weak , but the velocity ( dashed line ) is sufficiently well determined because it is based on all seven hyperfine components , not just the one shown . we find a wide variety of spectral line profiles in the h@xmath0co and cs lines in our sample : double - peaked , with a peak and a `` shoulder , '' and single symmetric lines .",
    "in addition , many sources have high velocity wings associated with unbound motions ( outflows ) .",
    "the cs and h@xmath0co line shapes differ from source to source , but are usually similar to each other .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line , on the other hand , is gaussian toward almost all sources . in sources with symmetric h@xmath0co and cs lines",
    ", their peak velocity lies very close to that of the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line . in sources with",
    "double peaked h@xmath0co and cs lines , the n@xmath0h@xmath3 peak velocity lies between the two peaks ( or between the peak and the shoulder ) , indicating that the complex h@xmath0co and cs line profiles arise from self - absorption at low velocities . as a proof of the lower optical depth of n@xmath0h@xmath3 we derive optical depths @xmath45 in the @xmath34 line in 93% of the sources , and @xmath46 in all of them .    in most class i sources , the h@xmath0co and cs lines are broader than the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line , but all three line profiles are essentially symmetric showing no evidence of self - absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fclassi ] ) . on the other hand , many of the observed cs and h@xmath0co profiles toward the class 0 sources show evidence of self - absorption .",
    "the h@xmath0co and/or cs spectral profiles are asymmetric with respect to the n@xmath0h@xmath3 center velocity in 15 out of 23 class 0 sources ( fig .",
    "[ fclass0 ] ) .",
    "most of these asymmetric profiles have peaks whose velocity is significantly blue - shifted , rather than red - shifted , from the velocity of the optically thin n@xmath0h@xmath3 line .",
    "this high incidence of self - absorption toward class 0 sources is similar to what gregersen et al.(1997 ) found in hco@xmath3 lines .    besides the variation in line shapes discussed above",
    ", the line widths vary by a factor of five over our source sample .",
    "for example , the fwhm of the n@xmath47h@xmath48 line varies from 0.3   in taurus to 1.8   in serpens .",
    "this is important to bear in mind when we use the peak velocity shift between lines to compare different sources in the following section .      to study the distribution of line profiles statistically , we need to quantify the observed line asymmetries .",
    "to do this , we define the non - dimensional parameter @xmath49 the velocity difference between the peaks of the optically thick and thin lines , normalized by the fwhm of the thin line .",
    "we use the normalized velocity difference @xmath15 rather than the velocity difference @xmath50 to reduce bias arising from lines having different width from one source to the next .",
    "this is a significant effect in our sample , as discussed above , and the normalization ensures that two lines of the same shape will have the same measure of asymmetry even if they have significantly different widths . to compute @xmath15 ,",
    "we first fit a gaussian to the brightest peak of the optically thick line to define its velocity ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "( 1995 ) ; this gives the n@xmath0h@xmath3 velocity and fwhm ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "we believe that @xmath15 is a more convenient and robust measure of the line asymmetry than the even - odd component decomposition ( mardones et al .",
    "1994 ) , the shift in line centroid ( adelson , & leung 1988 ; walker , narayanan , & boss 1994 ) , the ratio of blue to red peak brightness ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the line skewness ( gregersen et al .  1997 ) .",
    "the even - odd decomposition is too sensitive to the choice of reference velocity , and the line centroid is too sensitive to the choice of velocity window .",
    "the ratio of blue to red peak brightness can not be used for lines where a second peak is not well defined .",
    "the skewness is much more sensitive than is @xmath15 to asymmetry in the line wings , which may be due to outflow , not infall motions . on the other hand , the adopted @xmath15 has the disadvantage that it is ambiguous for double - peaked lines with nearly equal peak intensities . in our sample",
    "this occurs in only 3 sources in the cs line ( iras 16293 - 2422 , l483 and serp - s68n ) and one source in the h@xmath0co line ( l483 ; see fig .",

    "another way to quantify the asymmetries in the distribution of @xmath15 is to simply count the excess ( e ) number of sources with negative compared to positive @xmath15 .",
    "we define the `` blue excess '' e as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of sources with a `` significant '' blue - shift ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 is the number of sources with a `` significant '' red - shift ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 is the number of sources with no significant shift ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath70 is the total number of sources .",

    "we note that the cs and h@xmath0co velocity differences were normalized by the same n@xmath0h@xmath3 line width , so the correlation in figure [ fh2cocs ] is independent of the normalization .",

    "we have found an excess of sources with asymmetric optically thick lines ( double - peaked or shoulder profiles ) toward a sample of 47 nearby low mass ysos .",
    "this asymmetry is such that the peak velocity of the optically thick line is preferentially blue - shifted with respect to the optically thin velocity .",
    "this blue - shifted excess is statistically more significant in subsamples of sources with @xmath16  k. the observed blue excess of @xmath90 values is similar for the cs and h@xmath0co tracers and is independent of the telescope used .",
    "it is , therefore , an inherent property of the sources in the samples .",
    "the observed n@xmath0h@xmath3 line profile is single in all sources observed , ruling out multiple components as the cause of the asymmetric lines observed . in a few cases ( eg .",
    "l1448 mm ) , the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line profile departs significantly from a gaussian .",
    "however , in those cases the peak of the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line profile lies within the h@xmath0co or cs absorption dip and does not coincide with the peak of the h@xmath0co or cs profile .",
    "a foreground absorbing layer could reproduce the asymmetric line profiles we observe .",
    "however , we do not expect such a layer of dense gas ( having the systemic velocity of the source ) to lie in front of most of the sources observed unless it is physically associated . on the other hand , the spatial variation of optically thick line profiles",
    "show that the asymmetries are concentrated toward the sources (  [ sres ] ; also zhou et al .",
    "1993 , myers et al .",
    "1995 , mardones et al .",
    "1997 ) making the casual superposition of two clouds even more unlikely .",
    "we are led to explain the variety of line profiles observed as arising from _ local _ self - absorption , i.e.  absorption by physically associated gas .",
    "we now ask what kinematics should the local absorbing gas have with respect to the yso to reproduce the observed @xmath15 distributions . if the kinematics around a yso are dominated by infall",
    ", then we expect the foreground gas to be preferentially red - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the source .",
    "if this foreground gas has colder excitation temperature than the dense gas in the inner cloud , it will absorb preferentially at red - shifted velocities causing asymmetric line profiles ( eg leung & brown 1977 ; zhou 1992 ) .",
    "thus it will have a distribution of @xmath15 skewed toward blue velocities as observed .",
    "if systematic motions are due solely to infall toward a high fraction of class 0 sources , these motions can explain the observed statistics .",
    "the observed blue excess of @xmath15 can arise from infall , as opposed to expansion ; but other motions , including rotation and bipolar outflows , need to be considered .",
    "adelson & leung ( 1988 ) showed that rotation can cause infall - like and expansion - like line profiles on either side of the rotation axis ( see also zhou 1995 ) .",
    "the observed effect depends on the orientation of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight .",
    "a source sample with randomly oriented rotation axes would produce a symmetric distribution of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , bipolar outflows also cause infall- and expansion - like line profiles on either side of the source ( cabrit , & bertout 1986 ) .",
    "an ensemble of bipolar outflows with random orientation would also produce a symmetric distribution of @xmath15 , unlike our results .",
    "thus our statistical results do not rule out the contribution of outflow and rotation to the line profiles , but they require inward motions in addition to any outflow and rotation in a significant fraction of our source sample .",
    "outflow motions greatly affect the observed line profiles toward some sources , in particular among the class 0 sample . if outflow axes in this sample were not distributed randomly , or if the sample were too small , the outflows could , in principle , produce the observed statistical effect .",
    "we now examine on a source - by - source basis whether the observed outflow wings are associated with the excess of sources with blue @xmath15 in our sample .",
    "we subtracted one or two best - fit gaussians from the h@xmath0co and cs line peaks to measure the remaining blue and red wings in every spectrum .",
    "we then labeled each source s wings as blue if the blue wing is @xmath9125% brighter than the red , red if the red wing is @xmath9125% brighter than the blue , and nil otherwise .",
    "we find as many sources with brighter blue and red wings ( @xmath92 of each ) in both the h@xmath0co and cs lines , therefore the excess of sources with negative @xmath15 _ is not _ associated with a similar excess of sources with bright blue wings .    to test this further , we defined a wing parameter with values -1 , 0 , or 1 for sources with brighter wings to the blue , neither , or red respectively , and a line - core parameter with values -1 , 0 , or 1 for sources with a measured @xmath93 , @xmath94 , or @xmath95 respectively .",
    "we find a spearman rank correlation coefficient between the wing and the line - core parameters of 0.0 for the h@xmath0co sample and -0.1 for the cs sample .",
    "we conclude that the observed wing emission is not correlated with , and thus is not responsible for the excess of sources with negative @xmath15 derived in section 3 .    finally , it is possible that star forming groups could have large scale rotation or magnetic fields imposing a characteristic orientation to the disks and outflows around ysos .",
    "this effect could bias the statistics within each cluster .",
    "this is evidently not the case in this survey , because the projected outflow axes have a wide distribution in position angle within each cluster .",
    "the distribution of axis position angles of all outflows with well known orientation in ngc1333 has an rms of 56(bally , devine , & reipurth 1996 ) .",
    "bontemps et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a similar range of outflow axis position angles , with an rms of 55 in ophiuchus . in serpens ,",
    "the position angles of the outflows axis of the sources s68n , firs1 , smm2 , smm4 , and smm5 in serpens have an rms of 43(white , casali , , & eiroa 1995 , williams et al .",
    "therefore , within each of the clusters in our survey we can regard the source outflow axes as randomly oriented .",
    "we have shown that the observed distribution of @xmath15 is explained best by motions which include infall in addition to outflow and/or rotation .",
    "furthermore , we showed in  [ sdvdist ] that in our sample the infall signatures are seen almost entirely toward class 0 rather than class i sources .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these results is that class 0 sources differ from class i sources in having a much greater incidence of inward motions for the conditions which our observations probe size scales of a few @xmath96 0.01 pc and gas density of about 10@xmath97 @xmath9 .",
    "this difference , which has not been demonstrated before , adds support to the idea that class 0 sources have not yet accreted most of their mass , based mainly on the greater submillimeter continuum emission of class 0 than class i sources ( andre et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the lack of infall signatures in class i objects , however , does not necessarily mean that infall is absent in these sources .",
    "adams , lada , & shu ( 1987 ) showed that to model the spectral energy distribution of class i sources it is necessary to include the contribution of an infalling envelope . the lack of blue - shifted line profiles toward class i sources could therefore result from a lower sensitivity of our observations to the physical conditions in the infalling envelopes of class i sources .",
    "this would occur if the circumstellar envelopes in class i sources have less optical depth than in class 0 sources , or if the circumstellar envelopes in class i sources have smaller excitation temperature gradients than in class 0 sources ( in the optically thick cs and h@xmath0co lines ) .    to test the above ideas",
    ", we examined the optical depths determined from the multicomponent fits to the n@xmath0h@xmath3 spectra for the class 0 and class i sources in our sample .",
    "we found no significant difference between the two groups : the n@xmath0h@xmath3 optical depth , summed over all seven hyperfine components , has mean and s.e.m .",
    "@xmath98 for the class 0 , and @xmath99 for the class i source sample .",
    "this suggests that the greater incidence of blue - shifted profiles in class 0 than in class i sources does not arise from differences in line optical depth between the two samples .",
    "however , the lack of self - absorption features in the class i source line profiles may indicate that the cs and h@xmath0co optical depths could still be higher in class 0 than in class i sources . also , there are more weak single - peaked sources in the class i than in the class 0 source samples .",
    "sources whose outflow axes are in the plane of the sky , having edge on disks , may have significant obscuration to optical and near - infrared radiation , lowering their observed .",
    "this effect would tend to mix the class 0 and class i sources .",
    "however , the circumstellar envelopes are most likely optically thin at sub - mm wavelengths , so a sub - mm wavelength excess should distinguish class 0 from class i sources , independent of orientation . among our sample of class 0 sources , only 03282 + 3035 and",
    "l673a have not been detected at sub - mm wavelengths ; moving them to the class i sample would only emphasize the observed difference between the class 0 and class i samples .",
    "thus , we found a significant difference in the incidence of blue - shifted line asymmetry between the class 0 and class i sources , indicating different physical conditions in the circumstellar envelopes around class 0 and class i sources .",
    "however , our observations do not necessarily rule out the presence of inward motions onto class i sources ; tracers with higher optical depths may be needed to probe the circumstellar kinematics around class i sources .",
    "we summarize in table [ tinfall ] the evidence for infall , expansion , or neither for the sources in our sample .",
    "we list all 23 sources with @xmath100 in either the h@xmath0co or cs lines .",
    "we label the lines b if they have blue asymmetry ( @xmath65 ) , r if they have red asymmetry ( @xmath101 ) , or n if they have neither ( @xmath69 ) . we include iras 13036 - 7644 in the cs sample , using the spectrum published by lehtinen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the correspondance between both lines is extremely good , as expected from figure [ fh2cocs ] .",
    "following gregersen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we identify infall candidates as those sources with evidence for infall ( at least one `` b '' ) and no evidence for expansion in any line ( no `` r ' 's ) .",
    "therefore , from the h@xmath0co and cs observations presented in this paper , we select 15 sources as infall candidates : iras 03256 + 3055 , ngc1333 - 4a , ngc1333 - 4b , l1527 , iras 13036 - 7644 , vla1623 , wl22 , iras 16293 - 2422 , l483 , s68n , smm5 , smm4 , b335 , l1157 , and l1251b .",
    "these are class 0 sources ( @xmath16  k ) with the exception of iras 03256 + 3055 , wl22 and l1251b .",
    "in contrast to the 15 ( cs and h@xmath0co ) sources with at least one _ b _ and no _ r_s , there are only 4 with the opposite property at least one _ r _ and no _ b_s ( ngc1333 - 2 , l1551 - 5 , l1551ne and l43 ) .    among our infall candidates ,",

    "the sources iras 03256 + 3055 , ngc1333 - 4a and 4b , vla1623 , wl22 , and smm5 are new kinematic infall candidates based on this work .",

    "1995 ) observed 12 globules at the cso using the h@xmath0co @xmath10 line looking for kinematic infall signatures .",
    "they do not find convincing spectral evidence of infall toward any source .",
    "this may be because none of their sources are known to be class 0 ysos ; or due to the expected lower optical depth of the h@xmath0co @xmath10 line .",

    "their sample contains sources more distant than 400  pc , but the overlap with our sample is still considerable , with 15 sources in common .",
    "we derived @xmath15 from the hco@xmath3 and h@xmath104co@xmath3 spectra presented by gregersen et al .  toward 13 of those sources , and assigned asymmetry labels b , r , and n to them in the same way as for the cs and h@xmath0co spectra . in table",
    "[ tinfall ] we list the asymmetry labels from available observations : from this paper , from gregersen et al.(1997 ) , from ward - thompson et al .  ( 1996 ) , and from lehtinen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the correspondance among all lines is generally good .",
    "seven of the nine sources with infall asymmetry in the hco@xmath3 lines have the same sense of asymmetry in the h@xmath0co and cs lines .",
    "on the other hand , the two sources with expansion asymmetry in the hco@xmath3 lines show infall asymmetry in the h@xmath0co and/or cs lines ( l1448 mm and l483 ) , and one source ( ngc1333 - 2 ) shows infall asymmetry in hco@xmath3 @xmath103 ( ward - thompson et al 1996 ) and expansion asymmetry in cs and h@xmath0co . these disagreements may reflect differing degrees of outflow contamination from one line to the next .    assuming as in  [ scand ] that the best infall candidates are those sources with evidence for infall in at least one line , and with no evidence for expansion in any line , we consider again the sources in table [ tinfall ] , now according to their asymmetry in hco@xmath3 , as well as in cs , h@xmath0co . adding this hco@xmath3 data and applying this procedure",
    "removes only one source , l483 , from the cs and h@xmath0co list given in  [ scand ] , leaving the 14 sources indicated in table [ tinfall ] as the best infall candidates .",
    "these sources have substantial internal agreement among their asymmetry labels : 5 have 4 _ b_s , 2 have 3 _ b_s , 5 have 2 _ b_s , and 2 have 1 _ b_. at present , these sources have the most evidence from available spectral line surveys for infall , and they have the least evidence against infall .      the kinematic infall candidates identified in this paper include two sources b335 and l1527 which exemplify in several ways the `` standard model '' of low - mass star formation ( e.g.  shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "these sources are relatively isolated and have nh@xmath13 line widths dominated by thermal , rather than turbulent motions ( myers , & benson 1983 ; benson , & myers 1989 ) .",
    "their profiles of h@xmath0co and other lines are well - fit by radiative transfer models whose kinematics are specified by the `` inside - out '' mode of collapse of a singular isothermal sphere ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "but these two sources are not representative of the properties of the 15 kinematic infall candidates identified by the cs and h@xmath0co lines in this paper .",
    "most of these sources differ from the standard model in two ways : their line widths are dominated by turbulent motions , and many of them are found in stellar groups rather than in isolation .",
    "we quantify the turbulent motions of the infall candidates by comparing the fwhm of the optically thin n@xmath0h@xmath3 line , given in table [ tlines ] , with that expected for gas having equal thermal and nonthermal motions , @xmath105 where t is the gas kinetic temperature , @xmath106 is the mass of the observed species ( 29 amu for n@xmath0h@xmath3 ) , and @xmath107 is the mean molecular mass ( 2.3 amu ) . for gas with t = 15 k , 9 out of 15 sources , or 60% , have n@xmath0h@xmath3 line widths @xmath108 , i.e. having greater non - thermal than thermal motions .",
    "if t = 10 k , this fraction increases to 12/15 , or 80% .",
    "clearly most of the kinematic infall candidates have non - thermal motions exceeding their thermal motions .",
    "the non - thermal motions in the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line width could arise from motions which appear random to our resolution , which we designate as turbulence , and also from systematic motions , including outflow , infall , and rotation . since n@xmath0h@xmath3 lines ( like nh@xmath13 lines ) tend to trace quiescent core structure ( womack et al .",
    "1992 ) and do not track outflow maps ( caselli et al .",
    "1997 ) , we expect that the outflow contribution to the n@xmath0h@xmath3 line width is relatively small compared to the turbulent component .",
    "similarly , the relative contribution of rotation and infall motions to the optically thin line width is significantly smaller than the random contribution , according to infall models which match the profiles of infall candidates ( e.g.  zhou et al.1993 ) .    to assess the proportion of the infall candidates associated with groups or clusters , we consider those infall sources in the ngc1333 , ophiuchus , and serpens clouds , which are associated with a substantial cluster of embedded young stellar objects .",
    "of the 15 infall candidates listed in section  [ scand ] , 8 or 53% belong to these three clusters .",
    "this accounting is conservative in that we do not count l1251b which belongs to a smaller group of at least 5 near infrared sources ( hodapp 1994 ) . of these 8 sources in clusters ,",
    "most ( 6 ) have n@xmath0h@xmath3 line widths dominated by turbulent motions .",
    "this relatively high incidence of turbulent motions and cluster sources in our list of kinematic infall candidates implies that the standard model of isolated star formation in a thermally dominated core is not representative of most of our infall candidates .",
    "this is an area where more theoretical models are needed .",
    "models of star formation which account for significant turbulent motions as part of their initial conditions have been presented for a spherically symmetric geometry and for the formation of a single star ( caselli & myers 1995 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) ; but these models lack a physical basis for the non - thermal motions , and do not account for the formation of multiple stars .",
    "the infall candidates identified in this paper are good candidates for the study of star - forming infall .",
    "however , it is not established from the survey data presented here that their motions are necessarily either `` star - forming '' or `` gravitational . ''    a further step to establish if the blue - shift identified in class 0 sources arise from infalling envelopes is to map them : the blue - shifted , asymmetrical line profiles should be spatially concentrated toward the source .",
    "furthermore , maps are needed to disentangle the effects of the outflows .",
    "maps of observed line asymmetry ( eg .",
    "adelson & leung 1988 ; walker et al .",
    "1994 ) can distinguish whether infall dominates ( at low velocities ) over rotation or expansion in a given region .    to establish whether the observed infall kinematics are gravitational ,",
    "the observations should be compared with kinematic models , which predict the spatial variation of the line profiles ( eg .",
    "zhou et al 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , continuum observations may help determine the yso and envelope masses to compare with model predictions .",
    "high spatial resolution attainable with interferometers can locate the infall regions in relation to the position of the continuum peak of the yso .",
    "all of these together should constrain significantly kinematic models of gravitational collapse , to determine better the physical basis of the inward motions inferred in this paper . in addition",
    ", further models and observations may be needed to resolve the apparent conflicts presented in table [ tinfall ] .",
    "such models will have to incorporate both infall and outflow kinematics .",
    "among 47 of the youngest nearby low mass pms stars ( spectral classes 0 , or @xmath16  k , and i , or @xmath72  k ) a significant fraction show complex line profiles with double peaks or a peak and a shoulder in the optically thick cs @xmath2 and h@xmath0co @xmath1 transitions , which trace dense gas ( @xmath109 @xmath9 ) .    these complex spectral profiles are not due to multiple components along the line of sight , since the optically thin n@xmath0h@xmath3 @xmath34 line , observed toward the same sources , is single .",

    "the blue - shifted excess is 50% ( 9 out of 23 for h@xmath0co and 10 out of 19 for cs ) , while in the class i subsample there is no significant blue- or red - shifted excess .",
    "the observed excess of blue - shifts can not be reproduced by a sample of sources whose kinematics are dominated either by bipolar outflows or rotation , if their symmetry axes are oriented in random directions . on the other hand ,",
    "infall motions alone , or infall combined with rotation and/or outflows , can explain the excess of blue - shifts .",
    "we identify a total of 15 spectroscopic infall candidates , of which 6 have not been identified previously .",
    "most of these candidates differ from the well - known sources b335 and l1527 , which exemplify the `` standard model '' of an isolated core whose line width is dominated by thermal motions .",
    "they tend to have primarily turbulent line - widths , or are associated with embedded young clusters , or both .",
