    "weather forecasting is usually based on outputs of numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) models that represent the dynamical and physical behaviour of the atmosphere . based on actual weather conditions ,",
    "the equations are employed to extrapolate the state of the atmosphere , but may strongly depend on initial conditions and other uncertainties of the nwp model .",
    "a methodology that accounts for such shortcomings is the use of ensemble forecasts by running the nwp model several times with different initial conditions and/or model formulations @xcite .",
    "forecast ensembles play an important role when it desired to develop methods that transfer from deterministic to probabilistic forecasting , since information about forecast mean and variance may be extracted from several individual forecasts @xcite . in practise , however , ensemble prediction systems are not able to capture all sources of uncertainty , thus they often exhibit dispersion errors ( underdispersion ) and biases .",
    "statistical postprocessing models correct the forecasts in accordance with recent forecast errors and observations and yield full predictive probability distributions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two widely used approaches in statistical postprocessing that yield full predictive distributions based on a forecast ensemble and verifying observations . in the bayesian model averaging ( bma , ) approach each ensemble member is associated with a kernel density ( after suitable bias correction ) and the individual densities are combined in a mixture distribution with weights that express the skill of the individual ensemble members .",
    "ensemble model output statistics ( emos , @xcite ) combines the ensemble members in a multiple linear regression approach with a single predictive distribution . @xcite and apply the postprocessing methods to weather quantities , where a normal distribution can be assumed as underlying model , such as temperature and pressure . for the application to other weather quantities",
    "alternative distributions are required .",
    "an overview on existing variants of emos and bma can for example be found in and @xcite .    in cases where various probabilistic forecasts from different sources are available ,",
    "combining these forecasts can improve the predictive ability further .",
    "the individual forecasts might for example ( as in our application ) come from different competing statistical postprocessing models .",
    "the most widely used method to combine the individual predictive distributions is the linear pool ( lp ) , see for example @xcite , @xcite and references therein for reviews on the topic .",
    "@xcite show that the linear pool results in an overdispersed predictive distribution , regardless whether the individual components are calibrated or not .",
    "a more flexible and non - linear approach is the spread - adjusted linear pool ( slp ) .",
    "for example , and empirically observed overdispersion of the linear combined forecasts in case of approximately neutrally dispersed gaussian components and they introduced a non - linear spread - adjusted combination approach , that was generalized and discussed by @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite propose another flexible non - linear aggregation method , the beta - transformed linear pool ( blp ) , resulting in highly improved dispersion properties .",
    "although weather prediction implies temporal structures and dependencies , we were unable to find explicit applications of time series methods in the context of ensemble postprocessing methods . on the contrary , there are several approaches to apply time series models directly on observations of a weather quantity or other environmental and climatological quantities .",
    "to name only a few , @xcite apply an @xmath0 model to transformed wind speed data in order to simulate and predict wind speed and wind power observations .",
    "@xcite investigate the problems when fitting arma models to meteorological time series and , as an example , present an application to time series of the palmer drought index .",
    "@xcite fit specific arma models to surface pressure data .",
    "@xcite apply the box - jenkins modelling technique to monthly activity of temperature inversions .",
    "we propose to apply time series models in the context of ensemble postprocessing . to account for an autoregressive ( ar ) structure in time",
    "we construct a predictive distribution based on an ar - adjusted forecast ensemble ( local ar - emos ) .",
    "as the standard local emos predictive distribution shows signs of underdispersion and our local ar - emos distribution on the contrary clearly exhibits overdispersion we propose to combine ar - emos and emos with a spread - adjusted linear pool .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : section [ sec : methods ] presents our proposed ar modification of the forecast ensemble and briefly reviews the emos model and the spread - adjusted linear combination of probabilistic forecasts .",
    "sections [ sec : applicationtemp ] and [ sec : applicationsingle ] illustrate some possible applications of our basic ar - modification method in a case study with temperature forecasts of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) .",
    "we end the paper with some concluding remarks and a discussion of further extensions of our method .",
    "@xcite introduced the ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) model for the case , that a normal distribution can be assumed as model for the weather quantity . in all following sections we use a notation depending on the time index @xmath1 , to stress the fact that we explicitly model temporal dependencies through our autoregressive adjustment approach .",
    "the predictive distribution is obtained by fitting the following multiple linear regression model to the observation @xmath2 of the weather quantity @xmath3 and the forecast ensemble @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are real valued regression coefficients that can be interpreted as bias - correction coefficients , and @xmath7 is a normally distributed error term with @xmath8 . for convenience we define @xmath9 , yielding the representation @xmath10 of the emos model .    in case of an exchangeable ensemble ,",
    "the multiplicative bias correction parameters are chosen to be equal , that is @xmath11 , for @xmath12 . in this case , the emos model is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and we can define @xmath15 .    the variance of @xmath7 is parameterized as linear function of the ensemble variance to account for dispersion errors in the raw ensemble : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonnegative coefficients .",
    "models and both yield the following predictive emos distribution : @xmath19 the parameters of the distribution are estimated from a training period preceding the forecast time and re - estimated for each forecast time using a rolling training period of fixed length . @xcite",
    "propose to estimate the parameters by optimizing the continuous ranked probability score ( crps , @xcite ) over the training data .",
    "this estimation procedure is implemented in the r package ensemblemos @xcite .",
    "two variants of estimating the emos parameters exist , the global and the local emos approach . for global emos only one set of parameters is estimated , while for global emos a separate set is estimated at each station .    for our case study we consider a station - wise approach and therefore employ the local emos variant .",

    "order selection is done by the aic criterion , despite the circumstance that the estimated coefficients are not the maximum likelihood estimates .",
    "the described approach differs from the times series methods introduced e.g. by @xcite in the sense that it does _ not _ aim at directly modelling a weather quantity itself .",
    "the basic ar modification method can be employed for different purposes in ensemble postprocessing , depending on the need of the user .",
    "for example it can simply be used to obtain an ar - modified raw ensemble , or to build a postprocessed predictive distribution based on the modified ensemble .",
    "the following sections illustrate some possible applications of ar modified ensemble forecasts by means of a given data set , where we analyze the aggregated predictive performance and the performance at a single station .",
    "an ar - emos predictive distribution for temperature is introduced and shown to improve upon the well - established local emos method with respect to certain verification scores .",

    "a value of @xmath60 corresponds to the standard linear pool .",
    "typically a common spread parameter is used for all components , although the method can be generalized to have spread parameters varying with the components . however",
    ", this may be appropriate only in case the dispersion properties of the components differ to a high extent .     +",
    "the data set for our case study comprises an ensemble with @xmath61 members ( and one control forecast not used here ) of the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "initialized at 00 utc , the forecasts are issued on a grid with 31 km resolution , and they are available for forecast horizons in 3 hour steps up to 144 hours . in germany 00 utc corresponds to 1 am local time , and to 2 am local time during the daylight saving period . for our analysis",
    "we consider @xmath62-h ahead forecasts for 2-m surface temperature in germany along with the verifying observations at different stations in the time period ranging from 2010 - 02 - 02 to 2011 - 04 - 30 .",
    "although there is a total of 518 stations in the full data set , only @xmath63 stations with complete @xmath64 observations for the variables were retained . to use the forecasts in combination with globally distributed surface synoptic observations ( synop ) data ,",
    "they are bilinearly interpolated from the four surrounding grid points to the locations that correspond to actual observation stations .",

    "all 383 computed p - values are not greater than 0.046 ( the largest occurring value ) , indicating substantial autocorrelation in the forecast error series for each station .",
    "figure [ f3 ] further illustrates this point by showing the series of temperature observations together with the ensemble mean , the corresponding forecast errors , and the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the series of forecast errors for the randomly chosen station ruppertsecken in rhineland - palatinate .    to account for autocorrelation in a series of forecast errors ,",
    "the following subsections present an approach to obtain a predictive distribution based on the ar modification method ( ar - emos ) , while section [ sec : applicationsingle ] discusses ar - emos for the station frankfurt a.m. with regard to a much longer than before verification period of 3650 days .",
    "when the mean @xmath66 of the raw ensemble is considered as a deterministic - style forecast @xmath20 , a corresponding ar modified forecast @xmath67 can be generated according to the procedure described in section [ sec : ar ] . for computing the order and the coefficients of the ar@xmath27 process",
    ", a training period of @xmath68 days previous to the forecast day is considered . for each day out of the @xmath69 remaining days from the forecast ( verification ) period , the ar coefficients are newly estimated , where the training period is shifted accordingly ( rolling training period ) .    when choosing an appropriate length of training period , there is usually a trade - off .",
    "longer training periods yield more stable estimates , but may fail to account for temporal changes , while shorter periods can adapt more successfully to changes over time . to learn about an appropriate training length , a variety of possible values , namely @xmath70 , were considered in a preliminary analysis , and for each station the mean absolute error @xmath71 of the ar modified forecast @xmath72 has been computed .",
    "as it turned out , a training length of @xmath73 days provided a favorable performance with respect to the mae averaged over the considered stations .",

    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ f2 ] shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble and the pit histograms of the three methods over 3650 days , behaving similar to the pit histograms computed over all 383 stations in figure [ f1 ] . particularly the raw ensemble and local emos exhibit an additional forecast bias .",
    "while the raw ensemble tends to underestimate the temperatures at frankfurt a.m. , local emos tends to overestimate it .",
    "the hump shape of the local ar - emos predictive distribution already seen in figure [ f1 ] , is even more pronounced when investigating the pit values of a single station . as in figure",
    "[ f1 ] , our slp combination is closest to uniformity , although the first bin is more occupied than in the overall pit histogram of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "these observations are in line with the results of table [ t5 ] , showing the variance of the pit values and the root mean variance as a measure of sharpness .",
    "similar to the situation presented in the left panel , the variance of the local emos pit values is larger than @xmath75 , indicating underdispersion , while the variance of the local ar - emos pit values is smaller than @xmath75 , indicating overdispersion . when considering the pit values only for the station frankfurt a.m. , the variance of the pit values is even smaller than in the overall case ( table [ t4 ] ) , corresponding to the more pronounced hump - shape .",
    "the variance of the pit values of the slp combination differs only slightly from @xmath75 , indicating that the pit histogram is close to uniformity .",
    "the sharpness properties of the predictive distribution directly correspond to those in table [ t4 ] . while local emos is sharpest and local ar - emos is least sharpest , our slp combination has a sharpness value between the other two .",
    "the diebold - mariano test statistic introduced in section [ sec : dmtest ] for comparing the predictive performance of local emos with our derived slp combination ( here applied to the crps series at the station frankfurt ) is @xmath76 for @xmath77 , thereby indicating a highly significant nonequal predictive performance of the two methods .",
    "in this work , we propose a basic ar - modification method that accounts for potential autoregressive structures in forecast errors of the raw ensemble .",
    "the ar - modification is straightforward to compute by standard ` r ` functions to fit ar processes and can be utilized in the context of ensemble forecasts in different ways .",
    "it can simply be employed to obtain an adjusted  raw  ensemble of forecasts that is corrected for autoregressive structures or it can be used to construct different types of predictive distributions .    to this end , our proposed modification is simple and yet effective . in our case study",
    "we suggest to built an emos - like predictive distribution based on the ar - adjusted ensemble and in a second step obtain an aggregated predictive distribution that comprises of the state - of - the - art emos predictive distribution and our ar - emos variant .",
    "as emos is a well - established standard postprocessing procedure that is easy to compute , our proposed extension can be easily constructed .",
    "further , the approach is neither restricted to a specific postprocessing model nor to temperature forecasts .",
    "a modification of the approach allowing to combine the method with other standard postprocessing models such as bma should be straightforward .",
    "our ar - modification approach allows for a flexible bias - correction based on fitting ar process to the error series .",
    "the method identifies cases where a correction for autoregressive structures is indicated and performs a simple bias - correction based on past values in cases where no substantial autocorrelation is present . in the considered case",
    "study all our derived variants based on the ar - modification approach improve on the standard emos method .",
    "while the improvement of the ar - emos predictive distribution on the standard emos distribution is only small and ar - emos still lacks calibration , the slp combined predictive distribution based on emos and ar - emos shows a pit histogram close to uniformity and the improvement on standard emos with respect to the verification scores is highly significant .    in line with the recently increased interest in multivariate postprocessing models that yield physically coherent forecasts , it should be of interest to extend our method to this field of research . an approach that allows to retain dependence structures with low computational cost",
    "is the ensemble copula coupling ( ecc ) method introduced by .",
    "ecc is able to recover temporal , spatial and inter - variable dependencies present in the raw ensemble by reordering samples from the predictive distributions according to the rank structure of the raw ensemble .",
    "it is a flexible and computationally efficient method , as one needs to compute simply the rank order structure of the raw ensemble .",
    "a combination e.g. of our slp predictive distribution with ecc would be straightforward and easy to compute .",
    "this procedure can account for spatial dependence structures between the stations not considered by our station - wise approach and it may even be able to recover additional temporal dependencies from the raw ensemble , that are not explicitly modelled by our ar - approach that only considers the autoregressive structure in the errors .    while ecc is a nonparametric method that can recover different types of multivariate structures simultaneously ,",
    "there are several parametric approaches to incorporate spatial or inter - variable dependencies . and for example propose spatially adaptive extensions of the basic bma method , while @xcite , @xcite and investigate different ways of extending emos to incorporate spatial dependencies .",
    "there is also an interest to investigate inter - variable dependencies . for example",
    "develop a bivariate emos model for wind vectors and @xcite a bivariate bma model for temperature and wind speed .",
    "further , @xcite investigate a general multivariate setting that allows to combine arbitrary univariate postprocessing distributions within a gaussian copula framework .",
    "the development of multivariate postprocessing models is a very active area of research , and an extension of our proposed ar - modification that incorporates spatial or inter - variable dependencies as well should be highly beneficial .",
