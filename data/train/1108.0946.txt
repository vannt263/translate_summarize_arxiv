    "nir color gradients do not exhibit any significant environmental dependence , implying that age ( rather than metallicity ) gradients are changing with the environment . the small panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : col_mass_env ] also show that , at all masses , group galaxies have redder central colors than those in the field . on average ,",
    "the color difference amounts to @xmath54  mag in @xmath41 , and @xmath55  mag in @xmath43 .",
    "this may result from both age and metallicity increasing with mass , and group ( relative to field ) etgs having older stellar populations , as found by , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dependence of internal colors of etgs on mass and environment is mainly driven by the age and metallicity of the underlying stellar populations , which is motivated by the existence of well - established absorption - line gradients in etgs ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "although a dust component may also generate color gradients  @xcite , no observational evidence has been found so far that dust can play a major role ( @xcite ; ldd10 ) .    .",

    "each sp model consists of a pair of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) with  @xcite imf , from the charlot & bruzual ( 2011 , in preparation ; cb11 ) synthesis code .",
    "the `` inner '' ssp is used to model central galaxy colors , while the difference of @xmath35 between the two ssps is fitted to @xmath33 , providing @xmath2 and @xmath57 .",
    "the fitting is done in a @xmath58 sense by varying age and metallicity of both ssps in the range @xmath59  gyr and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we found that similar results are obtained when using  @xcite population synthesis models , or using exponentially declining star - formation models .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_mass_env ] , the age and metallicity content of etgs depends significantly on both galaxy mass and environment , reflecting the behavior of optical  optical and optical  nir colors of fig .",
    "[ fig : col_mass_env ] . for all environments and mass bins ,",
    "the main driver of color gradients in etgs is a significantly negative ( @xmath61 ) metallicity gradient ( consistent with e.g.  @xcite ) , with field galaxies having somewhat shallower @xmath57 ( by @xmath62 ) than their group counterparts .",
    "however , age is found to play a significant role , and , perhaps more importantly , this depends on the environment where galaxies reside .",
    "group galaxies have positive , albeit small , age gradients ( @xmath63 , i.e. an age variation of @xmath64 per radial decade ) , with the galaxy stellar populations being younger in the center than in the outskirts , while field etgs exhibit systematically smaller , mostly negative , age gradients , consistent with @xcite based on the analysis of the evolution of the color gradients of field etgs from goods data .",
    "notice , however , that at high - mass field galaxies also tend to have slightly positive @xmath2(@xmath65 ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this letter suggests that there is a significant trend of the internal distribution of age and metallicity in massive etgs with galaxy mass and environment .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_mass_env ] can be qualitatively discussed in the light of current formation scenarios of etgs , considering that most ( @xmath66 ) of our sample of group galaxies consists of satellite , rather than central , galaxies ( according to the definition of  @xcite ) :    _ - gas - rich mergers . _",
    "the presence of a younger stellar population ( i.e. a positive age gradient ) in the center of group etgs supports a dissipative formation picture , whereby gas - rich mergers fuel the central region with cold gas , allowing for the formation of younger , metal - enriched , stars . in a hierarchical picture of galaxy formation , the more massive etgs start forming stars at earlier epochs ( albeit assembling later , see  @xcite ) , when disk - like progenitors likely had a more turbulent and clumpy ism  @xcite , possibly implying a larger amount of dissipation .",
    "this might explain why age ( metallicity ) gradients tend to marginally increase ( decrease ) with stellar mass .",
    "however , this is not supported by sph simulations of galaxy formation , with merging producing no correlation of metallicity gradients and mass  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "both the light profile shape as well as the size  mass relation of etgs at @xmath67 provide evidence against an increasing importance of gas dissipation at high mass  @xcite .",
    "_ - cold accretion . _",
    "an alternative scenario to explain positive age gradients involves the accretion of cold ( clumpy ) gas from the cosmological surroundings , leading to subsequent star formation in the central region .",
    "cold accretion is expected to be more important at high redshift ( @xmath68 ) , being a relevant mode for the formation of galaxies as massive as @xmath69  ( @xcite , but see also  @xcite ) . in a cold accretion scenario , where the formation process resembles monolithic collapse ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath57 would naturally correlate with galaxy mass as star formation lasts longer in the center of more massive systems having a deeper central potential well ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the fact that : ( 1 ) the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations within and among etgs are tightly correlated to the local escape velocity  @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the resulting gradients depend on mass ( e.g.  @xcite ) and , at fixed mass , on the duration of star - formation , a property that can be parametrized by the @xmath70 to iron abundance ratio ( ldd10 ) .",
    "one should notice , however , that the existence of a correlation between @xmath57 and mass has been longly debated in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "_ - later gas accretion .",
    "_ while group galaxies have their star formation quenched when entering bigger halos ( through `` strangulation '' ) , field galaxies can accrete gas longer , by radiative cooling of their dark - matter hot - gas reservoir , and form a younger , more metal - rich , stellar component outwards .",
    "this would lower , and eventually invert , the age gradient , making also metallicity gradients shallower , consistent with what we see for field etgs in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_mass_env ] .    _ - stripping . _ environmental effects , such as ram pressure and/or tidal stripping , may also trigger ( central ) star formation in recently accreted group satellites ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in general",
    ", stripping should be less important for high - mass galaxies , inconsistent with the trends seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_mass_env ] . _ - dry merging .",
    "_ etgs can also form by gas - poor interactions .",
    "minor dry mergers and stellar accretion can drive the formation of the outer envelopes of etgs , explaining their size evolution with redshift  @xcite .",
    "gas - poor mergers should mix the stellar populations within galaxies , flattening pre - existing metallicity and age gradients  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath57 steepen with mass ( see also ldd10 ) , our data seem to reject major dry - mergers as the main channel for the formation of etgs , unless the amount of flattening is small  @xcite .",
    "minor dry - mergers would lead to a deposit of metal - poor , old , stellar material in the outer regions of a galaxy , increasing ( decreasing ) the age ( metallicity ) gradients .",
    "therefore , the trends of @xmath2 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_mass_env ] might also result from minor dry - mergers to be more important at high - mass ( consistent with model predictions ; see  @xcite ) and preferentially in group , relative to field , environments .",
    "however , such a trend would be at odds with the finding of a lack of environmental dependence of the redshift evolution of etgs on the mass - size plane  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "although we find that several mechanisms can contribute to the observed age and metallicity gradients in etgs ( among them , cold accretion and minor dry mergers are the most likely ones ) , we do indeed detect physical differences in the formation mechanisms with respect to environment , with field ( relative to group ) galaxies having the characteristic flatter gradients expected from inside  out star formation induced by late gas - cooling .",
    "studies of radial gradients outside of the effective radius will shed more light into the mechanisms that drive the formation of early - type galaxies .",
    "we used data from the sdss ( http://www.sdss.org/collaboration/credits.html ) .",
