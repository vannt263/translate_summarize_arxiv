    "the were - set of a pseudoknot is the set of ordered pairs where the first entry of a pair is a knot that may be realized by resolving all crossings in a pseudodiagram of the pseudoknot , and the second entry is the probability of obtaining the given knot type in a random resolution of precrossings .",
    "while the were - set is a powerful invariant , it may be difficult to compute for pseudoknots with large precrossing numbers .",

    "therefore , @xmath135 in @xmath38 may be replaced by any odd - length pseudotwist to produce a pseudolink @xmath58 with the same pseudodeterminant as @xmath38 .",
    "the inductive proof for the even length pseudotwist is similar . indeed , since @xmath135 is a subtwist of every pseudotwist , any pseudotwist ( regardless of the parity of its length ) can be replaced by any other pseudotwist with length of the same parity without changing the pseudodeterminant .",
    "for example , consider the family of pseudoknots comprised of @xmath153 together with all of the pseudoknots obtained by replacing the pseudotwists @xmath154 and @xmath155 each by arbitrary pseudotwists of the same parity .",
    "each pseudoknot in this family has pseudodeterminant 9 since , for instance , @xmath156 , by theorem  [ ptwist ] .",
    "computing the coloring numbers of pseudoknots with @xmath157 crossings , we find evidence that a very small portion of pseudoknots will be non - trivially colorable : from 8583 knots with @xmath157 crossings , only 112 will be non - trivially colorable , 70 with @xmath158 , 11 with @xmath159 , 5 with @xmath160 , 23 with @xmath161 , 1 with @xmath162 , 1 with @xmath117 , and 1 with @xmath163 .",
    "instead of considering particular pseudoknots and their colorings , we may explore the extension of colorability to families of pseudoknots ( given in conway notation ) .",
    "take , for example , the pseudoknot @xmath106 with @xmath158 .",
    "this pseudoknot is the first member of the family of pseudoknots @xmath164 which contains nontrivially colorable pseudoknots .",
    "all resolutions of @xmath110 are rational knots of the form @xmath165 , with @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , with determinant @xmath169 for every @xmath43 .",
    "( see  @xcite for more on computing determinants of rational knots . )",
    "the @xmath170 of these determinants , i.e. , the pseudodeterminant , will be @xmath171 .",
    "for example , pseudoknots @xmath172 have @xmath173 , while pseudoknots @xmath174 have @xmath175 , _ etc . _    in appendix a",
    ", we provide a table of families of colorable pseudoknots that are derived from pseudoknots with at most @xmath176 crossings . in the same way as for the example above ( which is entry ( 1 ) in our table )",
    ", we can obtain general formulae for the pseudodeterminant @xmath177 of pseudoknot families by using general formulae for the determinants of classical knots .",
    "for example , for family ( 2 ) from the table , the determinant is @xmath178 for every @xmath43 , so the pseudodeterminant is @xmath179 . knowing that the determinant @xmath4 of classical rational knots and links @xmath180 is given by the general formula @xmath181 for every @xmath43",
    ", we also conclude that for family ( 3 ) , the pseudodeterminant is again @xmath171 .",
    "proceeding in this way , we determine all entries in the table .",
    "a knot diagram @xmath4 is said to have the _",
    "kauffman - harary property _ ( or _ kh property _ for short ) if it can be endowed with a nontrivial coloring mod @xmath0 which assigns a unique color to each arc  @xcite .",
    "a pseudodiagram @xmath4 is said to have the kh property if all of its resolutions have the kh property .",
    "the smallest example of a pseudodiagram with the kh property is the pseudodiagram @xmath182 . both of its resolution diagrams @xmath183 and",
    "@xmath184 have the kh property for the coloring mod 9 ( fig .",
    "[ f09 ] ) .",
    "the kh property is not just a property of particular pseudoknots , but of the entire families .",
    "for example , all pseudoknots @xmath185 with @xmath186 have kh property .",
    "indeed , we find that both resolution diagrams @xmath187 and @xmath188 are colorable mod @xmath177 with @xmath189 different colors .",
    "figure [ f10 ] shows the second member of this family , pseudoknot @xmath190 with @xmath163 and its resolution diagrams @xmath191 and @xmath192 colored mod 25 with 11 colors .     with @xmath161 and colorings of its resolutions ( b ) @xmath183 and ( c ) @xmath184 colored with 7 colors .",

    "[ f12],width=403 ]    another example of a pseudoknot family with the kh property is the family @xmath198 with @xmath199 . both of its resolution diagrams @xmath200 and @xmath201 are colorable mod @xmath177 with @xmath202 colors ( fig .",
    "[ f11 ] ) .",
    "this family can be extended to the pseudoknot family @xmath203 with the kh property , where @xmath204 , and each diagram is colorable mod @xmath177 with @xmath205 colors ( fig .",
    "[ f12 ] ) .    an interesting question involving",
    "the kh property for pseudoknots relates to the idea of a pseudoalternating pseudodiagram .",
    "a pseudodiagram is _ pseudoalternating _ if it has an alternating resolution .    a pseudodiagram with the kh property can not be pseudoalternating .",
    "we conclude our exploration of pseudoknot colorability with another idea concerning a possible direction for future work .",
    "more open problems about colorings of pseudoknots relate to the number of colors used for coloring mod @xmath0 . for every pseudoknot colorable mod @xmath0",
    ", we can define @xmath206 and @xmath207 as the minimal and maximal number of colors needed for coloring @xmath110 , where both numbers are taken over all diagrams of @xmath110 @xcite . just as in the case of classical knots",
    ", the first invariant will be very hard to compute .",
    "this is because , for every knot with @xmath208 and @xmath209 , there exists a diagram that is colorable using @xmath43 colors , where @xmath210 .",
