    "except in cases of extreme metallicity @xcite , the galaxy is not old enough to produce low - mass white dwarfs ( lmwds ) through single - star evolution . instead , lmwds are expected to form through interactions with another star @xcite . indeed , with few exceptions , follow - up observations consistently find companions to lmwds @xcite .",
    "recently , the elm wd survey has identified 61 extremely lmwds ( @xmath5 ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we refer to the 55 wds found by these authors that have a measured radial velocity ( rv ) and orbital period ( @xmath6 ) as the elm sample .",
    "these rv and @xmath6 measurements indicate that the lmwds companions are most likely wds .",
    "however , since the inclination angle @xmath7 is unknown , lmwds could have neutron star ( ns ) companions .",
    "indeed , lmwds are known companions to millisecond pulsars , although these wds are generally too faint for spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "finding even one ns companion to a spectroscopically characterized lmwd would be very valuable , since this system could constrain the ns mass .",
    "to date , unfortunately , radio and x - ray searches for ns companions to lmwds have been unsuccessful @xcite .    for each lmwd in the elm sample , spectroscopy provides @xmath6 , the primary wd mass @xmath8 , and the projected orbital velocity @xmath9 .",
    "assuming circular orbits , we can write : @xmath10 where the right side is the mass function @xmath11 .",
    "the companion mass , @xmath12 , is minimized for an edge - on orbit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "because of this dependence on @xmath7 , the nature of the companion can not usually be determined based on @xmath11 alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : porb - m1 ] shows that the population of lmwds with pulsar companions occupies the same region in @xmath14 space as those with wd companions .",
    "therefore , barring rare circumstances such as eclipsing systems , individual lmwds with ns companions can not be identified from optical observations alone .",
    "the elm sample is now large enough that the @xmath12 distribution and ns companion fraction can be constrained statistically .",
    "we have developed a probabilistic model to infer parameters of an assumed form for the @xmath12 distribution .",
    "our method is similar to that employed by @xcite and @xcite to describe the mass distribution of nss in binaries using post - keplerian parameters .",
    "we focus on the following questions : can the companion population be modeled using a simple description of @xmath12 ? how does the @xmath12 distribution compare to predictions from population synthesis simulations ? what is the rate of lmwd - ns binaries implied by our model ?",
    "what are the resulting distributions of ns probabilities for individual systems in the elm sample ?    to answer these questions , we build the mathematical framework ( section 2 ) , then test our resulting model ( section 3 ) .",
    "we apply our model to the elm sample ( section 4 ) before concluding ( section 5 ) .",

    "we construct a statistical model to constrain a parametric model for the distribution of lmwd companion masses , @xmath15 . for each system , we assume we have @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath8 , and therefore know @xmath11 .",
    "we wish to derive posterior constraints on the model parameters , @xmath18 , which describe the distribution of companion masses , @xmath19 , given the set of observed mass functions , @xmath20 , by deconvolving the @xmath11 distribution from the unobserved inclinations .",
    "using bayes rule , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the likelihood , @xmath23 is the prior on parameters @xmath18 , and the evidence integral , @xmath24 , is a constant that depends only on the data .",
    "the likelihood , @xmath22 , can be split into a product over the likelihoods of individual systems : @xmath25 where the product is over each of the @xmath26 systems .",
    "this marginal likelihood involves integrals over the unobserved quantities @xmath7 and",

    "we use a two - component gaussian mixture model .",
    "we truncate the distributions using physically motivated bounds : the wd component is restricted to @xmath42~{\\ifmmode { { \\rm m}_{\\odot}}\\else m$_{\\odot}$\\fi}$ ] and the ns component is restricted to @xmath43~{\\ifmmode { { \\rm m}_{\\odot}}\\else m$_{\\odot}$\\fi}$ ] .",

    "to reduce the number of parameters in our model we fix @xmath49 and @xmath50 to : @xmath51 as some nss in binaries may be somewhat more massive than the canonical ns mass of 1.35 m@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the probability of any particular wd having a ns companion , @xmath53 , can be computed for a given set of parameters for the @xmath12 distribution : @xmath54    our companion mass model parameters are then @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , we use a uniform prior from @xmath57 ; for @xmath58 , we use a logarithmic ( scale - invariant ) prior over the range @xmath59 .",
    "finally , we use a uniform prior over the dimensionless @xmath3 from @xmath60 .",

    "the algorithm uses an ensemble of individual `` walkers '' to naturally adapt to the geometry of the parameter - space being explored .",
    "we run the walkers for a burn - in period of 500 steps starting from randomly drawn initial conditions ( sampled from the priors in table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) .",
    "we then re - initialize the walkers from their positions at the end of this run and run again for 1000 steps .",
    "we remove the burn - in samples to eliminate any effects due to our choice of initial conditions .",
    "we test the performance of this gaussian mixture model on four separate data sets : three mock data sets and a sample of sdss post - common - envelope binaries ( pcebs ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of the 100 systems in our three mock data sets is generated by computing a @xmath11 from a random @xmath8 ( drawn from a uniform distribution , @xmath66 ) , @xmath12 ( from the distributions described below ) , and @xmath7 ( from an isotropic distribution ) .",
    "we apply the same gaussian mixture model to all four tests to infer the parameters of the wd mixture component and @xmath3 .",
    "we first generate companion masses by drawing from a single , truncated gaussian with the parameters given in table  [ tbl : parameters ] .",
    "this mock sample contains no nss . in the top row of figure",
    "[ fig : tests_1_2 ] , the left - most panel shows that our model finds a maximum a posteriori ( map ) @xmath12 distribution ( black line ) that qualitatively matches the input distribution ( gray histogram ) .",
    "the second and third panels show samples from the posterior distributions and contours containing 68% and 95% of the samples for our three model parameters .",
    "the input values ( dashed lines ) lie cleanly within the inner contour in both panels , although @xmath3 has a tail up to @xmath6710% .",
    "equation  [ eq : p_ns ] gives the probability of an individual system hosting a ns .",
    "using posterior samples , we can determine the distribution of @xmath53 for each system .",
    "the right - most panel in figure  [ fig : tests_1_2 ] includes all the individual systems , ordered by @xmath11 , and shows the distributions of @xmath53 for each . for most systems , there is negligible probability above @xmath68 .",
    "we use the same gaussian distribution to generate companion masses for the wds but add a ns component with @xmath69 .",
    "the bottom row of figure  [ fig : tests_1_2 ] shows that our model again recovers the input values for @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "importantly , the third panel shows that our model also recovers @xmath3 , although the posterior shows a substantial tail toward higher @xmath3 .",
    "tick marks in the right - most panel of figure  [ fig : tests_1_2 ] indicate  true \" nss in our mock data .",
    "our model correctly assigns high @xmath53 to roughly half of these . however , many systems with ns companions have inclinations too low to be statistically differentiated from those with wd companions .",
    "we generate companion masses for the wds by sampling from a uniform distribution over @xmath70~{\\ifmmode { { \\rm m}_{\\odot}}\\else m$_{\\odot}$\\fi}$ ] , again with @xmath7110% .",
    "the top row of figure  [ fig : tests_3_4 ] shows the results .",
    "the posterior distribution in the second panel indicates that @xmath56 and @xmath58 are not well constrained .",
    "the preference for larger @xmath58 is expected , as the model flattens the gaussian model distribution to match it with the input uniform distribution .",
    "interestingly , the third panel shows that despite having a non - gaussian input distribution for @xmath12 , and a poorly constrained @xmath58 , our model still recovers @xmath3 approximately as accurately as in test 2 .",
    "furthermore , the fourth panel of figure  [ fig : tests_3_4 ] demonstrates that our model effectively identifies which lmwds host ns companions .",
    "pcebs are composed of wds in close orbits with main - sequence companions .",
    "the @xcite sample of 54 sdss pcebs , which have precisely determined @xmath16 , @xmath6 , and masses for the main - sequence companions , are an ideal test sample for our model .",
    "our model uses these parameters to try and recover the pcebs wd mass distribution , which we can then compare to the spectroscopically determined wd masses .",
    "our map distribution ( black line ) is shown in the left - most panel in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : tests_3_4 ] .",
    "our model qualitatively recovers the true @xmath72 distribution ( gray histogram ) .",
    "the third panel shows that the posterior @xmath3 distribution is very low , as expected since there are no ns companions in the pceb sample .",
    "this is further illustrated in the right - most panel , where every pceb in the sample has low @xmath53 values .",
    "the elm wd survey is based on the hypervelocity star survey @xcite , and includes previously identified sdss lmwds @xcite .",
    "objects are chosen for spectroscopic follow - up based on their @xmath73 colors , and this choice is independent of the mass and nature of any putative companions .",
    "therefore , at least with regard to @xmath7 and @xmath12 , the population is unbiased .",
    "the elm wd sample includes 55 systems with rv variations fit to orbital solutions , which provide precise measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "wd masses in these systems are derived from fits to spectroscopic templates , which are generally precise to @xmath6710% @xcite .",
    "the masses of cool lmwds may suffer somewhat from inaccuracies in the one - dimensional wd atmospheric models @xcite .",
    "however , since this should only affect the coolest wds in the elm sample , we expect any impact on our results to be minor .",
    "three systems are eclipsing binaries , with known companion masses : nltt 11748 ( @xmath74 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sdss j065133.3@xmath75284423.3 ( @xmath76 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sdss j075141.2@xmath77014120.9 ( @xmath78 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these systems",
    ", the likelihood reduces to : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass of the wd companion .",
    "the other six elm systems show no evidence of orbital motion , with rv upper limits of @xmath6720 - 50 km s@xmath81",
    ". some of these systems may be in low @xmath7 binaries with rvs below the detection limit , or may have @xmath82 hr , which is difficult to measure @xcite .",
    "these lmwds could also have companions at systematically longer @xmath6 , resulting in orbital velocities below the detection limit .",
    "we do not include these systems in our analysis .",
    "the results from applying our model to the elm sample are shown in figure  [ fig : elm_post ] .",
    "the map model gives @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the marginal posterior over @xmath56 and @xmath58 has a tail toward larger @xmath58 , which could indicate that the true wd distribution may not be exactly gaussian .",
    "it is interesting that the best - fit gaussian for the companions to the elm wds is similar to that of the population of single hydrogen - atmosphere wds in sdss , with a mean of 0.6 @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "our map variance is significantly larger : @xmath85 , compared to @xmath86 , possibly due to past mass transfer phases increasing the masses of the unseen primary wds .",
    "the low combined mass in these systems indicates that , although several of them will merge within a hubble time @xcite , the majority of the elm systems are unlikely to be type ia sn progenitors .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that some individual lmwd binaries may be massive enough to produce type ia sne @xcite .",
    "our posterior distributions further suggest that the companions to lmwds have predominantly co cores .",
    "this is in contrast to population synthesis models , which suggest that lmwds should predominantly have he - core wd companions @xcite . with a larger sample ,",
    "a more sophisticated lmwd companion model could place quantitative constraints on population synthesis predictions .",
    "the third panel in figure  [ fig : elm_post ] shows a @xmath3 strongly peaked toward 0% .",
    "however , there is a significant tail toward higher ns probabilities .",
    "our model indicates @xmath87 at the 68% confidence level , in agreement with independent constraints from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath88% ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath89 ) , both based on radio non - detections of lmwd companions .",
    "the right - most panel in figure  [ fig : elm_post ] indicates there are two lmwds with substantial @xmath53 : sdss j081133.6@xmath75022556.8 and j174140.5@xmath75652638.7 .",
    "however , the x - ray non - detection of sdss j174140.5@xmath75652638.7 suggests its companion is unlikely to be a ns @xcite .",
    "searches for radio and x - ray emission from sdss j081133.6@xmath75022556.8 are on - going .",
    "we note that the @xmath53 distributions in each of our samples show a trend such that systems with higher @xmath11 have higher @xmath53 values .",
    "these high @xmath11 systems are therefore ideal targets to search for ns companions to lmwds .",
    "we have developed a statistical model to infer the companion mass distribution for a sample of single - line , spectroscopic binaries .",
    "this model can be applied to any such sample with measured @xmath8 and @xmath11 . when tested on three separate mock data sets with unseen wd and ns companions to lmwds",
    ", our model recovers the input parameters .",
    "even when the companion mass distribution is not drawn from a gaussian distribution , our model still infers the input ns fraction to within a few percent .",

    "we applied our model to the set of lmwds from the elm wd survey .",

    "our model returns a map @xmath90 , suggesting that a majority of elm wds have co - core wd companions .",
    "this is in contrast to predictions from population synthesis models , which find that the dominant companion population should be he - core wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our model further indicates that the fraction of elm wds with ns companions is consistent with 0% , but could be as high as @xmath6716% ( within 1-@xmath91 ) .",
