    "the data indicate that these clouds are located at the intersection between the magnetic and rotational equators .",
    "regions of helium enhancement are coincident with regions of metal deficiency .",
    "the longitudinal field maxima map to phases of maximum hydrogen emission . at these phases",
    ", we view the star s magnetic poles with the plasma clouds in quadrature .",
    "these new data are in good agreement with not only previous observations , but also the overall qualitative plasma geometry predicted by the rrm .",
    "as a first exploitation of the current data set , we evaluate the appropriateness of the magnetic field configuration assumed by townsend et al .",
    "prior to the present paper , the longitudinal magnetic field curve for @xmath0 ori e could be reasonably fit with a sinusoid , indicating a simple dipole structure .",
    "townsend et al .",
    "( 2005 ) invoked a significant offset of the dipole magnetic field in their application of the rrm model to @xmath0 ori e in order to explain asymmetries in both the h@xmath1 emission spectra and the photometric variations .",
    "using the ephemeris of townsend et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the offset dipole model fits the historical longitudinal field curve with a reduced @xmath37 of 2.92 ( 20 degrees of freedom ; 22 data points - 2 model parameters ) .",
    "the error bars on these data are large enough that they are not able to distinguish between a large range of magnetic field configurations . when the new data are added ( fig . [ blrrm ] ) , the model reproduces the general character of the observations , but disagrees quantitatively with the detailed variation .",
    "the offset dipole model fit to the new measurements computed from lsd profiles gives a reduced @xmath37 value of 92.9 ( 16 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the new h@xmath3 measurements fit with the same model give a reduced @xmath37 of 11.2 ( 16 degrees of freedom ) , while the new he line measurements have a reduced @xmath37 of 21.6 ( 34 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "since the longitudinal magnetic field is an average quantity over the stellar disk , an even more stringent test of the rrm model magnetic field configuration can be obtained from the stokes @xmath16 and stokes @xmath2 profiles , which , by doppler broadening , map variations of physical quantities across the surface of the star .",
    "[ mdiprfdip ] compares the predictions of the rrm offset dipole model with observed stokes  @xmath16 and stokes  @xmath2 profiles of the he  i 5876 and 6678   lines .",
    "the synthetic stokes parameters were calculated using the forward mode of the mdi code invers10 , adopting @xmath41=140 km  s@xmath27 ( determined using the current spectra ) and @xmath42 . in this specific model ,",
    "the he abundance distribution was adopted from the doppler imaging analysis of @xmath0 ori e , which will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "nevertheless , models with uniform he distribution applied to the same magnetic field parameters produce similar profiles .",
    "the magnetic field configuration of townsend et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predicts a far more extreme phase modulation and much larger amplitudes of the stokes  @xmath2 profiles than are observed .",
    "the disagreement between the synthetic and observed profiles is especially apparent for rotational phases 0.318 - 0.720 .",

    "( 1987 ) ( squares ) .",
    "each data point is plotted with corresponding 1@xmath0 error bars .",
    "the solid curve is the model longitudinal magnetic field curve from the offset dipole configuration of townsend et al .",
    "the data are phased using the ephemeris of townsend et al .",
    "( 2010).,width=3 ]    comparison of the rrm model magnetic field configuration and new spectropolarimetric data in both longitudinal magnetic field curve and stokes  @xmath16 and stokes  @xmath2 profiles demonstrate that the specific offset dipole field model invoked by townsend et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is not compatible with the new data .",
    "the strong offset produces a much larger variation of the magnetic field across the visible stellar surface than is reflected by the observations , as illustrated by the model fit to the stokes  @xmath2 profiles .",
    "these profiles indicate that the model requires a very different field topology , further suggested by the periodic variability of the longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "while we can not definitely rule out the possibility of some alternate offset dipole , the asymmetric shape of the longitudinal magnetic field curve indicates a more complex field , requiring higher - order field components to match the shape of the variation .",
    "this paper lays the observational groundwork to re - evaluate the rrm model for @xmath0 ori e. new spectroscopy is in agreement with previous observational studies of @xmath0 ori e ( e.g. pedersen & thomsen 1977 ; landstreet & borra 1978 ; reiners et al .",
    "the h@xmath1 variability confirms the general picture derived from the rrm model of a rapidly rotating star in which the magnetic field overpowers the stellar wind , allowing plasma to become trapped in a magnetosphere that co - rotates with the star . while the rrm model agreed reasonably well with",
    "the previously observed longitudinal magnetic field curve for @xmath0 ori e , new , more precise measurements reveal a substantial variance between the shapes of the observed and modeled curves .",
    "these results challenge the offset dipole form assumed in the townsend et al .",
    "( 2005 ) application of the rrm model to @xmath0 ori e , and indicate that future models of its magnetic field should also include complex , higher - order components .",
    "as observations improve , more comprehensive modeling is required to explain the intricate physical phenomena of @xmath0 ori e. we are currently in the process of using mdi to derive both abundance maps for strong variable spectral lines and magnetic field maps based on several he i lines .",
    "the circumstellar features observed in line profiles should not affect the resulting surface abundance maps , as these features have a much higher radial acceleration than the stellar surface ( see e.g. donati & collier cameron 1997 ; donati et al .",
    "these new abundance maps will provide detailed information of the surface distribution of several elements , as well as provide the information to compute a total synthetic photospheric light curve for @xmath0 ori e. we plan to use detailed model atmospheres to calculate flux distributions and simulate a light curve , as described by krticka et al .",
    "the magnetic field mapping will offer greater clarity into the structure of the magnetic field , however as our data do not include linear polarization ( stokes  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 spectra ) data , magnetic inversions require an assumption about global field topology to reduce ambiguity . in its current state ,",
    "the rrm model can only compute predictions for a dipole magnetic field .",
    "we anticipate , with these future models , a clearer understanding of the remarkable physical phenomena of @xmath0 ori e. moreover , this work will provide the groundwork for analysis and modeling of similar massive magnetic stars .",
