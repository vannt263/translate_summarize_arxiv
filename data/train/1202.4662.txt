    "neutron stars ( ns ) are extraordinary astronomical laboratories for the physics of dense neutron - rich nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the main parts of a ns are the crust and the core .",
    "the latter , divided into the outer core and the inner one , has a radius of approximately 10 km and contains most of the star s mass while the crust , with a thickness of about @xmath2 km and containing only a few percent of the total mass , can also be divided into an outer and an inner part .",
    "a very important ingredient in the study of the structure and various properties of neutron stars is the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important predictions of a given eos is the location of the inner edge of a neutron star crust .",
    "the inner crust comprises the outer region from the density at which neutrons drip - out of nuclei , to the inner edge separating the solid crust from the homogeneous liquid core . at the inner edge , in fact",
    ", a phase transition occurs from the high - density homogeneous matter to the inhomogeneous one at lower densities .",
    "the transition density takes its critical value @xmath3 when the uniform neutron - proton - electron matter ( npe ) becomes unstable with respect to the separation into two coexisting phases ( one corresponding to nuclei , the other one to a nucleonic sea ) @xcite .",
    "while the density at which neutrons drip - out of nuclei is rather well determined , the transition density @xmath0 at the inner edge is much less certain due to our insufficient knowledge of the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "the value of @xmath0 determines the structure of the inner part of the crust .",
    "if sufficiently high , it is possible for non - spherical phases , with rod- or plate - like nuclei , to occur before the nuclei dissolve .",
    "if @xmath0 is relatively low , then the matter undergoes a direct transition from spherical nuclei to uniform nucleonic fluid . the extent to which non - spherical phases occur will have important consequences for other properties determined by the solid crust  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the determination of the transition density @xmath0 itself is a very complicated problem because the inner crust may have a very complicated structure .",
    "a well established approach is to find the density at which the uniform liquid first becomes unstable against small - amplitude density fluctuations , indicating the formation of nuclear clusters .",
    "this approach includes the dynamical method @xcite , the thermodynamical one @xcite , and the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that the core - crust transition density and pressure are very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear matter symmetry energy  @xcite . at present , the symmetry energy is well constrained experimentally up to the value of the nuclear saturation density @xmath4 but still remains almost unknown in the density regime appropriate for the interior of neutron stars ( @xmath5 )  @xcite . in spite of the experimental uncertainty of the symmetry energy , there are many theoretical considerations of the symmetry energy categorized mainly in phenomenological and effective field theoretical approaches .",
    "the aim of this work is : a ) to apply a momentum dependent interaction model ( mdi ) as well as two additional non relativistic models ( thomas - fermi and skyrme type ) to determine the transition density and transition pressure corresponding to the edge of a neutron star crust and b ) to check the accuracy of the parabolic approximation widely used in the literature and applied to neutron star research .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we review the taylor expansion of the energy while in sec .",
    "3 we present the thermodynamical method for the determination of the transition density and pressure of the inner edge of a neutron star crust .",
    "the nuclear models employed in the the present work are presented in sec .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally sec .",
    "6 summarizes the present study .",
    "the energy per particle @xmath6 in cold asymmetric nuclear matter can be expanded around @xmath7 as follows @xmath8 where the total baryon density @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the proton ( neutron ) density , @xmath12 is the asymmetry parameter and @xmath13 is the energy per baryon of the symmetric nuclear matter , while the coefficients of the expansion are @xmath14 in ( [ expans-1 ] ) , only even powers of @xmath15 appear due to the fact that the strong interaction must be symmetric under exchange of neutrons with protons i.e. the contribution to the energy must be independent of the sign of the difference @xmath16 .",
    "the second order approximation of the expansion ( [ expans-1 ] ) is written as @xmath17 we expect , from a mathematical point of view , that the above expansion is accurate at least close to @xmath7 ( the case of symmetric nuclear matter ) .",
    "however for the majority of the energy functionals , the above approximation works well for higher values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath18 and even close to the value @xmath19 corresponding to the pure neutron matter .",
    "thus , in cases for which the expansion , in a good approximation , is independent of the asymmetry parameter @xmath15 , the symmetry energy can be defined as @xmath20 and the energy per baryon is written @xmath21 the knowledge of the equation of state of neutron rich matter is fundamental in astrophysical applications .",
    "for example it is the basic ingredient for the study of @xmath22-stable matter characteristic for the interior of neutron stars .",
    "actually , for the most of the equations of state ( mainly those originating from microscopic calculations or those coming from relativistic mean field theories ) only the energy of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are determined and the definition of the symmetry energy from equation ( [ esym - def ] ) is almost unavoidable .",
    "the question naturally arising is the magnitude of the width of the error introduced by assuming a priori that the equation of state is parabolic according to relations ( [ expans-1 ] ) and ( [ par-1 ] ) .    in the present work",
    "we define in addition the _ second order expansion _ of the form @xmath23 which is similar to expansion ( [ par-1 ] ) replacing the quantity @xmath24 by @xmath25 .    before trying to check the accuracy of the approximation ( [ par-1 ] )",
    "it is worth to compare the density dependence of the above two definitions of the symmetry energy i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 given by ( [ expan-2 ] ) and ( [ esym - def ] ) respectively .",
    "the core - crust interface corresponds to the phase transition between nuclei and uniform nuclear matter .",
    "the uniform matter is nearly pure neutron matter , with a proton fraction of just a few percent determined by the condition of beta equilibrium .",
    "weak interactions conserve both baryon number and charge @xcite , and from the first law of thermodynamics , at temperature @xmath28 we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the internal energy per baryon , @xmath31 is the total pressure , @xmath32 is the volume per baryon ( @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the baryon density ) and @xmath35 is the charge fraction ( @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the proton and electron fractions in baryonic matter respectively ) . in @xmath22-equilibrium",
    "the chemical potential @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the chemical potentials of the protons , neutrons and electrons respectively .",
    "the stability of the uniform phase requires that @xmath44 is a convex function  @xcite .",
    "this condition leads to the following two constraints for the pressure and the chemical potential @xmath45 @xmath46 it is assumed that the total internal energy per baryon @xmath44 can be decomposed into baryon ( @xmath47 ) and electron ( @xmath48 ) contributions @xmath49 the related theory has been extensively presented in our recent publication  @xcite .",
    "we consider the condition of charge neutrality @xmath50 which requires that @xmath51 .",
    "this is the case we will consider also in the present study .",
    "hence , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the constraints ( [ cond-1 ] ) and ( [ cond-2 ] ) , in the case of the full eos ( feos ) and the parabolic approximation ( pa ) , are written @xmath52 @xmath53>0 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given equation of state , the quantity @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) is plotted as a function of the baryonic density @xmath34 and the equation @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) defines the transition density @xmath0 .",
    "however , what remains is the determination of the proton fraction @xmath37 ( as a function of the baryon density @xmath34 ) in @xmath22-stable matter . in this case",
    "we have the processes @xmath58 which take place simultaneously .",
    "we assume that neutrinos generated in these reactions have left the system .",
    "this implies that @xmath59 given the total energy density of the baryons @xmath60 , the neutron and proton chemical potentials can be defined as ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath61 it is easy to show that after some algebra we get @xmath62 the charge condition implies that @xmath63 or @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 are the fermi momenta ) .",
    "in addition , the chemical potential of the electron is given by the relation ( relativistic electrons ) @xmath66 finally , from equations ( [ chem-3 ] ) and ( [ chem - ele-1 ] ) one has @xmath67 equation ( [ x - frac ] ) is the most general relation that determines the proton fraction of @xmath22-stable matter . in the case of the pa the above equation , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ par-1 ] ) is written as @xmath68 the pressure @xmath1 at the inner edge is an important quantity directly related to the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia , which can be measured indirectly from observations of pulsars glitches  @xcite .",
    "the total pressure is decomposed also into baryon and lepton contributions @xmath69 where @xmath70 the electrons are considered as a non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "their contribution to the total pressure reads @xmath71 the transition pressure , in the case of the feos , is given now by the equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the proton fraction related to the transition density . in the case of the pa @xmath1",
    "is given by the relation @xmath74      the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia @xmath75 can be expressed as a function of @xmath76 ( star s total mass ) and @xmath77 ( star s radius ) with the only dependence on the equation of state arising from the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . actually , the major dependence is on the value of @xmath1 , since @xmath0 enters only as a correction according to the following approximate formula  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia is particularly interesting as it can be inferred from observations of pulsar glitches , the occasional disruptions of the otherwise extremely regular pulsations from magnetized , rotating neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "link et al .",
    "@xcite showed that glitches represent a self - regulating instability for which the star prepares over a waiting time .",
    "the angular momentum requirements of glitches in the vela pulsar indicate that more than @xmath80 of the star s moment of inertia drives these events .",
    "so , if glitches originate in the liquid of the inner crust , this means that @xmath81      the r - modes are oscillations of rotating stars whose restoring force is the coriolis force @xcite .",
    "the gravitational radiation - driven instability of these modes has been proposed as an explanation for the observed relatively low spin frequencies of young neutron stars and of accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries as well .",
    "this instability can only occur when the gravitational - radiation driving time scale of the r - mode is shorter than the time scales of the various dissipation mechanisms that may occur in the interior of the neutron star .",
    "the nuclear eos affects the time scales associated with the r - mode , in two different ways .",
    "firstly , eos defines the radial dependence of the mass density distribution @xmath82 , which is the basic ingredient of the relevant integrals .",
    "secondly , it defines the core - crust transition density @xmath83 and also the core radius @xmath84 which is the upper limit of the mentioned integrals .",

    "in the present work we employ three different phenomenological models for the energy per baryon of the asymmetric nuclear matter having the advantage of an analytical form .",
