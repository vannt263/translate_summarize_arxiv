    "the seminal discovery that every massive galaxy in the local universe harbors a super - massive black hole ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) implies that all massive galaxies must have hosted agn activity at some time during the past @xmath13  13  gyrs ( e.g. ,  rees 1984 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . to trace accurately how and when these black holes grew requires a detailed census of agn activity that will provide , amongst other things , estimates of the efficiency and duty cycle of black - hole growth and any dependencies of nuclear obscuration on agn luminosity , redshift , and host - galaxy type ( e.g. ,  marconi 2004 ; la franca 2005 ; shankar 2007 ) .    the exceptional sensitivity of the _ chandra _ deep field observations ( e.g. ,  brandt et  al .",

    "2003a ) has helped to unveil a @xmath14 times larger population of agns than found at most other wavelengths ( @xmath13  7200  deg@xmath15 ; e.g. ,  bauer et  al .",
    "optical spectroscopic follow - up observations have shown that these agns are detected out to @xmath6  5 , and detailed x - ray spectral analyses have revealed that the majority of the sources are obscured by gas and dust ( e.g. ,  barger et  al .",
    "2003 ; szokoly et  al . 2004",
    "; tozzi et  al . 2006 ; see brandt & hasinger 2005 for a review ) .",
    "however , although clearly effective at identifying even heavily obscured agns out to high redshift , there is compelling evidence that a large fraction of the agn population remains undetected at the @xmath16  kev observed - frame energies probed by these surveys : ( 1 ) about half of the x - ray background ( xrb ) is unresolved at @xmath17  kev ( worsley et  al . 2005 ) , ( 2 ) the _ observed _ obscured : unobscured agn ratio is lower than that found for comparably luminous agns in the local universe ( e.g. ,  treister & urry 2005 ) , ( 3 ) the blank - field number counts are steeply rising at the faintest x - ray fluxes ( rosati et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and ( 4 ) few compton - thick agns ( @xmath18  @xmath5 ) have been identified , even though they comprise @xmath13  50% of the agn population in the local universe ( e.g. ,  risaliti et  al .",

    "many of the x - ray undetected agns are expected to be intrinsically luminous sources that are heavily obscured by compton - thick material ( i.e. ,  @xmath19  @xmath5 ; see comastri 2004 for a review ) .",
    "the most robust identification of a compton - thick agn is made from high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) x - ray spectroscopy , where the detection of a high equivalent - width fe  k emission line ( @xmath20  1  kev at rest - frame energies 6.46.9  kev ) and a steeply rising reflection component at @xmath14  kev reveals that little or no x - ray emission is being seen directly , implying that the central source is very heavily absorbed ( e.g. ,  george & fabian 1991 ; matt , brandt , & fabian 1996 ; maiolino et  al . 1998 ; matt et  al . 2000 ) . however , since the extreme obscuration toward the nucleus of a compton - thick agn renders the observed @xmath16  kev emission @xmath13",
    "301000 times fainter than the intrinsic ( i.e. ,  unabsorbed ) emission , it is often challenging to identify robustly these sources on the basis of their x - ray data alone ; the range of absorption correction factors is based on the observed to intrinsic x - ray luminosity ratio for the agns in table  8.1 of comastri ( 2004 ) , with the observed x - ray fluxes from bassani et  al .",
    "for example , despite compton - thick agns comprising half of the agn population in the local universe , only @xmath13  50 sources have been reliably identified from x - ray data to date ( e.g. ,  comastri 2004 ) .",
    "fortunately , although not as conclusive as high s / n x - ray spectroscopy , the presence of compton - thick absorption can also be identified in x - ray weak agns when a reliable measurement of the intrinsic power of the agn is available at other wavelengths ; we stress here the necessity for x - ray constraints in order to identify a compton - thick agn since it is only in the x - ray band that an absorbing column density can be measured or inferred .",
    "two of the most reliable measurements of the intrinsic power of an obscured agn are the luminosity of the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ; rest - frame @xmath21  @xmath0 m ; e.g. ,  efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; granato et  al .",
    "1997 ; lutz et  al . 2004 ) continuum and high - excitation emission lines ( i.e. ,  [ oiii]@xmath225007 ; e.g. ,  allen 1973 ; kwan & krolik 1981 ; bassani et  al .",
    "1999 ) , both of which are believed to be directly illuminated by the central source .",
    "these emission regions provide a good proxy for the intrinsic agn luminosity , even in the presence of extreme compton - thick absorption , since they are more extended than the x - ray absorbing material ( i.e. ,  larger than the broad - line region ; e.g. ,  lamer et  al .",
    "2003 ; risaliti et  al .",
    "2007 ) . as the luminosities of both the mid - ir continuum and the high - excitation emission - line region are dependent on many factors , including the location and geometry of the region with respect to the central source , more robust constraints are placed if both measurements are available .",
    "comprehensive evidence for a large x - ray undetected agn population has been found from a variety of x - ray based analyses using sources detected in deep _ spitzer _",
    "surveys at mid - ir wavelengths , suggesting that compton - thick agns may be ubiquitious in the distant universe ( e.g. ,  donley et  al .",

    "2007 ; fiore et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , all of these studies have relied on photometric observations for the identification of candidate compton - thick agns , leading to significant uncertainties in measurements of the intrinsic agn luminosity , the absorbing column density , the degree of contamination from star - formation activity , and by implication , the space density of distant compton - thick agns . in this paper",

    "the dashed lines are the predicted space densities of compton - thick agns for a range of x - ray luminosity lower limits from the gilli ( 2007 ) xrb model .",
    "the space density of the compton - thick quasars robustly identified here is a factor @xmath13  15 higher than that found for comparably luminous unobscured quasars , indicating that compton - thick accretion is ubiquitious at @xmath6  2 ; see  4.4 for a more detailed discussion.,width=340 ]    we can compare our estimated space density to those determined from the photometric selection of candidate compton - thick agns by daddi ( 2007a ) and fiore ( 2008 ) . on the basis of the x - ray data and",

    "the intrinsic luminosities of these mid - ir excess galaxies are about an order of magnitude lower than the compton - thick quasars identified here , and consequently their space density is higher ( @xmath129  mpc@xmath9 ; see fig .  7 ) .",
    "fiore ( 2008 ) estimated the intrinsic x - ray luminosities of their x - ray undetected candidate compton - thick agns using the 5.8  @xmath0 m luminosities , finding @xmath130  erg  s@xmath3 . taking into account the estimated redshift range of their objects ( @xmath6  1.22.6 ) ,",
    "we calculate a space density of @xmath131  mpc@xmath9 ; as mentioned in fiore ( 2008 ) , this space density is consistent with that predicted for compton - thick agns using the xrb model from gilli ( 2007 ) .",
    "taken at face value , these results suggest that lower - luminosity compton - thick agns were times more common than compton - thick quasars at @xmath6  2",
    ". however , since the primary evidence for compton - thick agn activity in these studies was from x - ray stacking analyses , there could be significant numbers of non - compton - thick agns in their samples ( i.e. ,  either compton - thin agns or star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "both daddi ( 2007a ) and fiore ( 2008 ) asssessed the `` contamination '' from star - forming galaxies to their stacked x - ray results and concluded that @xmath132  50% and @xmath133% of the objects are heavily obscured agns , respectively .",
    "however , these percentages refer to the fraction of photometrically identified objects that are heavily obscured agns and direct optical - mid - ir spectroscopic identification will be required to determine what fraction of these agns are obscured by compton - thick material .",
    "we can also compare our results to those determined for more luminous compton - thick quasars .",
    "polletta ( 2006 ) identified five candidate compton - thick quasars at with @xmath134  erg  s@xmath3 on the basis of the _ chandra _ data in the swire survey , giving a space density of @xmath135  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "two of these objects have been presented here as robust compton - thick quasars ( sw  j104406 and sw  j104409 ; see table  1 ) .",
    "however , the other three candidate compton - thick quasars are all undetected at 24  @xmath0 m ( @xmath136  @xmath0jy ; see table 2 of polletta 2006 ) .",
    "this suggests that either the intrinsic agn luminosities of these compton - thick quasars are more modest ( @xmath137  erg  s@xmath3 ) than those estimated by polletta ( 2006 ) or that the x - ray  mid - ir relationship shown in fig .",
    "4 does not hold for these luminous objects .",
    "martnez - sansigre et al.(2007 ) identified ten compton - thick quasars at @xmath6  1.74.2 with an average bolometric luminosity of @xmath138  erg  s@xmath3 , giving a space density of @xmath139  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "on the basis of the bolometric conversion of elvis ( 1994 ) , which martnez - sansigre et al.(2007 ) also adopted , the estimated average x - ray luminosities are @xmath140  erg  s@xmath3 for these sources , suggesting that they are very luminous agns .",
    "however , since two of their objects are compton - thin quasars that are detected at x - ray energies , we can directly estimate the intrinsic 210  kev luminosities of the candidate compton - thick quasars using the average x - ray6  @xmath0 m luminosity ratio of the compton - thin quasars . taking this approach and using the median 24  @xmath0 m flux for the sample ,",
    "the typical intrinsic x - ray luminosities of these quasars would be more modest ( @xmath141  erg  s@xmath3 ) , casting significant doubt on whether they are obscured by compton - thick material ; the rest - frame 6  @xmath0 m fluxes are derived from the observed 24  @xmath0 m fluxes using the ngc  1068 sed to apply small @xmath142-corrections .",
    "direct spectroscopic identification of these photometrically classified compton - thick quasars is required to place more direct constraints , which should be possible with current instrumentation .",
    "lastly , we compare our results to the compton - thick agns identified by tozzi ( 2006 ) using x - ray spectral analysis of x - ray detected agns in the _ chandra _ deep field - south survey .",
    "fourteen of the objects investigated by tozzi ( 2006 ) had x - ray spectra that were better fitted by a pure reflection model than an absorbed power - law model , and were consequently classified as compton - thick agns ; derived space densities are @xmath143  mpc@xmath9 at @xmath6  1 and @xmath144  mpc@xmath9 at @xmath6  2 . while the tozzi ( 2006 ) study provides the most quantitative x - ray identification of distant compton - thick agns to date , it is also possible for compton - thin agns to have a pure reflection component ( i.e. ,  if the power - law component has temporarily decreased ) , and other pieces of evidence are required to confirm that these are compton - thick agns .",
    "two of the seven objects with spectroscopic redshifts have strong fe  k@xmath95 emission lines , confirming that they are likely to be compton thick , but supporting evidence for compton - thick absorption is lacking in the other objects .",
    "the current study provides diagnostics to identify distant compton - thick agns but is limited in source statistics , covers a narrow redshift range , and is restricted to the brightest agns at @xmath6  2 .",
    "future studies could focus on obtaining optical  mid - ir spectroscopy of lower - luminosity @xmath6  2 candidate compton - thick agns , as well as identifying objects at lower and higher redshifts . assuming the ngc  1068 template used here and the average x - ray  mid - ir relationship shown in fig .  4 , an agn with @xmath145  erg  s@xmath3 will have 24  @xmath0 m fluxes of @xmath13  2  @xmath0jy , @xmath13  15  @xmath0jy , @xmath13  0.3  mjy , and @xmath13  5  mjy at @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , respectively ; these fluxes will typically scale linearly with luminosity ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "mid - ir bright objects ( @xmath150  mjy ) should be identifiable with _ spitzer_-irs but mid - ir spectroscopic identification of fainter objects will need to wait until the launch of the _ james webb space telescope_. optical and near - ir spectroscopy may be easier to obtain for many of the candidate compton - thick agns , although only if the agns have identifiable emission lines , which could be weak in low - luminosity and dust - reddened agns ( e.g. ,  caccianiga 2007 ; see  4.3 ) .",
    "ultimately , deep x - ray data are required to search directly for the presence of compton - thick absorption in individual objects using high s / n x - ray spectroscopy . for the majority of the objects investigated here",
    ", this will require @xmath151  ms exposures with current x - ray telescopes ; see fig .",
    "5 . however , due to its large lensing boost it is possible to provide reasonable x - ray spectral constraints for fsc  10214 + 4724 in a modest _ chandra _ exposure ( e.g. ,  a 100  ks _ chandra _ exposure would yield almost 100 x - ray counts , @xmath14 times more than found for hdf - omd49 ; see fig .  3 ) .",
    "large improvements in the x - ray spectral constraints for distant compton - thick agns will need to wait for the next generation of x - ray observatories ( e.g. ,  _ constellation - x _ , _ nustar _ , _ simbol - x _ , _ xeus _ ) , where the foci are high - resolution spectroscopy and/or high - energy imaging ( @xmath14  kev ) of faint x - ray sources .",
    "for example , a 1  ms _ xeus _ exposure will yield @xmath13  5000 counts for hdf - omd49 , allowing detailed x - ray spectral analyses and providing the potential to search for changes in the x - ray emission due to column density variations , giving direct insight into the environment around the black hole of a distant compton - thick agn ( e.g. ,  risaliti 2002 ) .",
    "we have presented _ spitzer_-irs spectroscopy and photometry of hdf - omd49 , a @xmath1 optically identified agn that is formally undetected in the 2  ms observation . from a combination of optical  mid - ir spectroscopy and x - ray data , we have shown that hdf - omd49 hosts an intrinsically luminous quasar that is obscured by compton - thick material ( @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ; @xmath97  @xmath5 ) .",

    "four of these compton - thick quasars lie in the goods - n field , and we used these objects to constrain the space density of distant compton - thick quasars , finding @xmath125  ( 0.72.5 )  @xmath8  mpc@xmath9 at @xmath6  22.5 . on the basis of our results , compton - thick quasars were as ubiquitious as unobscured quasars at @xmath6  22.5 , implying that a large fraction of the growth of supermassive black holes must have been obscured by compton - thick material .",
