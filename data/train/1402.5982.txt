    "fluctuations of conserved charges are promising observables for exploring critical phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a particular role is attributed to higher order cumulants of the net baryon number and electric charge fluctuations , which in a qcd medium , can be negative near the chiral transition @xcite .    at physical values of quark masses ,",
    "the phase transition in qcd is expected to change from a crossover transition at small values of the baryon chemical potential to a first - order transition at large net baryon densities .",
    "the first - order chiral phase transition , if it exists , then begins in a second - order critical point , the critical end point ( cep ) @xcite .",
    "owing to the divergent correlation length at the cep @xcite , and the spinodal phase separation in a non - equlibrium first - order transition @xcite , one expects large fluctuations of the net - baryon number in heavy ion collisions , at beam energies where the system passes through the first - order phase boundary or close to the cep .",
    "the conjectured existence of a cep in the qcd phase diagram has so far not been confirmed by lattice qcd calculations ( lqcd ) @xcite . at small values of the quark chemical potential , @xmath4",
    ", lqcd exhibits a chiral crossover transition .",
    "there are indications that , in the chiral limit for light quarks , the qcd transition belongs to the universality class of 3-dimensional @xmath3 spin systems @xcite .",
    "thus , a promising approach for probing the phase boundary in heavy ion collisions , is to explore the fluctuations of the chiral phase transition , assuming @xmath3 criticality .",
    "owing to the proximity of the chemical freeze - out to the chiral crossover at small values of the baryonic chemical potential , one may expect that the critical fluctuations are reflected in the data on conserved charges @xcite .",
    "a baseline for the cumulants of charge fluctuations is provided by the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , which reproduces the particle yields at chemical freeze - out in heavy ion collisions @xcite , as well as the lqcd equation of state in the hadronic phase @xcite .    at the cep , which is expected to belong to 3d @xmath5 universality class , the second and higher order cumulants diverge .",
    "by contrast , at a chiral phase transition belonging to the @xmath3 universality class , at vanishing baryon chemical potential , low - order cumulants remain finite , while the sixth and higher order cumulants diverge , diverging cumulants appear already at third order . ] . for",
    "non - zero quark masses , the divergences are replaced by a rapid variation of the cumulants near the crossover temperature , including changes of sign  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the net - baryon number , more precisely of the net - proton number , were measured in heavy ion collisions by star collaboration at rhic @xcite .",
    "data on the mean ( @xmath6 ) , variance ( @xmath7 ) , skewness ( @xmath8 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath9 ) of the net - proton number were obtained in a broad energy range and for different centralities .",
    "these observables are linked to the cumulants @xmath10 of the net - baryon number , and are accordingly modified by the critical chiral dynamics .",
    "the most recent star data show that , while the ratio @xmath11 is consistent with the hrg result in central collisions , differences are found in the products @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the deviations in the latter are small at the top rhic energy , increase with the order of the cumulants at fixed collision energy , and show a non - monotonic dependence on the energy with a maximum at @xmath14 gev . in the @xmath3 universality class one expects @xmath15 , while in @xmath5 this ratio is expected to be larger than unity @xcite .",
    "thus , the systematics of the ratios of cumulants in central au - au collisions , as measured by star @xcite , indicate that the observed deviations of the net proton number fluctuations from the hrg values may be attributed to @xmath3 criticality at the phase boundary , at least for @xmath16 gev .",
    "the cumulants of a conserved charge are given by appropriate combinations of moments of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "thus , the behavior of cumulants near criticality must be reflected in the properties of the probability distribution .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the critical behavior of the probability distribution depend on the universality class .",
    "indeed , we have recently shown , that the structure of the probability distribution for the net baryon number depends on the properties of the critical chiral fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have argued , that at vanishing chemical potential , the residual @xmath3 critical fluctuation at physical pion mass leads to narrowing of the probability distribution relative to the skellam function .",
    "this corresponds to a negative structure of the sixth order cumulant at the chiral crossover transition  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous studies to non - zero chemical potential and propose a method for identifying the characteristic properties of the net baryon probability distribution , which are responsible for the critical behavior of the cumulants at the chiral transition .",
    "we apply this method to the net proton probability distributions obtained by the star collaboration in central au - au collisions at @xmath17 gev .",
    "we also critically examine the question whether @xmath3 criticality can be captured by assuming that the baryon and antibaryon mutliplicities are described by binomial or negative binomial distributions .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the ( suitably rescaled ) ratio of the net baryon probability distribution to the corresponding skellam function , reveals the critical narrowing of the probability distribution , which is characteristic for the @xmath3 scaling .",
    "in the grand canonical ensemble specified by temperature @xmath18 , subvolume @xmath19 and chemical potential @xmath1 , the probability distribution for the conserved charge @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 where the canonical partition function @xmath22 is obtained e.g. by a projection of the grand partition function @xmath23 , @xmath24    in the hrg the probability distribution of the net - baryon number is , within the boltzmann approximation , given by the skellam function @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the thermal averages of the number of baryons and anti - baryons , respectively .",
    "the hrg model reproduces the particle yields in heavy ion collisions in a broad energy range from sis to lhc .",
    "furthermore , it describes the equation of state obtained in lqcd , as well as the first and second order cumulants of the net baryon number for temperatures below the chiral crossover temperature . on the other hand , as suggested in @xcite , the _ deviation _ of higher order cumulants and their ratios from the hrg results provides a potential signature for criticality at the phase boundary .",
    "these considerations indicate , that the probability distribution of the hrg , the skellam function , offers an appropriate baseline for @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath20 , where the probability distribution is fixed by the non - critical lowest order cumulants the skellam function provides a good approximation to @xmath0 . on the other hand , for large @xmath20",
    "the two distributions differ , since the critical fluctuations modify the tail of the distribution , which in turn determines the higher cumulants .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the skellam function as a reference for identifying criticality in the probability distribution of the net - baryon number @xcite . specifically , we show that the ratio of @xmath0 to the skellam function exposes the effect of critical fluctuations .",
    "we extract the characteristic features of the probability distribution near the chiral crossover transition within the @xmath3 universality class by applying the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach to the quark - meson ( qm ) model @xcite .",

    "the full thermodynamic potential is given by the minimum of @xmath44 .",
    "we solve the flow equation numerically by making use of the taylor expansion method @xcite . at the ultraviolet cutoff scale",
    "@xmath45 gev , the initial condition @xmath46 is fixed so as to reproduce the physical pion mass @xmath47 mev , and the sigma mass @xmath48 mev .",
    "the strength of the yukawa coupling is fixed to be @xmath49 by the constituent quark mass @xmath50 mev , with @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 mev .    to avoid the unphysical behavior of thermodynamic quantities at high temperatures , we include the higher momentum contributions , beyond the cutoff scale @xmath54 , by accounting for the @xmath55 and @xmath56dependent thermodynamic potential obtained through the flow equation for a non - interacting gas of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath0 is then obtained from eqs .   and , with @xmath57 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the frg approach was applied to compute @xmath0 of the net - baryon number within the qm model at @xmath58 . in the present paper , we extend these studies to finite chemical potential and identify the qualitative structures of the net baryon probability distribution which are due to @xmath3 criticality at the chiral crossover transition .",
    "we also evaluate the ratio of the data on the net proton probability distribution @xcite to the skellam function and discuss the results in the light of the theoretical considerations .         in general , the probability distribution @xmath0 depends on the volume parameter .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , the volume dependence of the re - scaled distribution @xmath59 is strongly reduced .",
    "this approximate scaling is valid for both the skellam function , and the @xmath0 calculated within the qm model for sufficiently large @xmath60 , and is exact for a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , in the ratios of @xmath0 and skellam , the leading volume dependence is cancelled . at finite density where @xmath61 , the scaling property holds for @xmath62 , after shifting the mean .    in order to compute the cumulants @xmath10 reliably , knowledge of the probability distribution @xmath0 for sufficiently large @xmath63",
    "is needed . for a given order @xmath64 , it is sufficient to know the distribution @xmath0 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 grows with @xmath64 and with the volume of the system @xcite . in the @xmath3 universality class and at @xmath58",
    ", @xmath67 is the first cumulant which exhibits criticality .",

    "@xmath70 is determined by requiring that the sixth cumulant of the skellam function is reproduced . as expected , we find that @xmath70 to a good approximation scales with @xmath71 .",
    "thus , in a plot of the ratio of @xmath0 to the skellam function as a function of @xmath72 , criticality is characterized by deviations from unity for @xmath73 .    in figure",

    "indeed , the decrease of the probability ratio for @xmath82 near @xmath78 is responsible for the negative values of @xmath67 , which are characteristic of the chiral crossover transition in the @xmath3 universality class @xcite .",
    "we note , that the narrowing of @xmath83 for smaller values of @xmath84 , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : frg](a ) , can be partly attributed to the non - critical reduction of @xmath85 .",
    "however , the smoothly decreasing tail of @xmath0 , close to @xmath86 , is entirely due to @xmath3 criticality , resulting in the characteristic shape and the negative structure of @xmath67 .",

    "thus , it is not a priori clear , how the distribution is modified by @xmath3 criticality .",

    "the @xmath1 dependence of the ratios , with a narrowing of the distribution for positive and a broadening for negative @xmath92 with increasing @xmath1 is characteristic for the critical region . as shown in fig .",

    "the measurement of higher order cumulants , + which are particularly sensitive to criticality , need high statistics owing to the increasing importance of the tail of the distribution .",
    "furthermore , the experimental conditions , such as acceptance corrections , must be under control in order to make a meaningful comparison of the measured cumulants and their probability distribution with theoretical predictions @xcite .",

    "also preliminary results on the sixth order cumulant have been presented by star for several collision energies and centralities  @xcite .    while the cumulant ratios measured by star  @xcite were efficiency corrected and tested against possible modifications due to volume fluctuations and accepted kinematical windows ,",
    "the data on the probability distributions of the net proton number are uncorrected .",
    "furthermore , in the model calculations , the net baryon number rather than the net proton number measured by the star collaboration , is considered .",
    "we assume , that the criticality due to chiral symmetry restoration , which appears in the net baryon number is also reflected in fluctuations of the net proton number . however , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the quantitative differences between cumulants of the net baryon and the net proton number are not excluded .",
    "therefore , the significance of a direct comparison of model predictions with the measured probability distribution is _ a priori _ not clear - cut .",
    "here we assume the isospin invariance such that the net baryon number fluctuations are equivalent to those of net proton number and invoke the generic properties of the probability distribution of the net baryon number due to @xmath3 criticality found in the qm model persist in the net proton number probability distribution .",
    "nevertheless , we have verified that the data on @xmath101 obtained by star @xcite are dominated by physics .",
    "the contribution of volume fluctuations to the data is small , as demonstrated by the approximate scaling of @xmath101 with the standard deviation @xmath7 in central and semi central collisions , for @xmath16gev .",
    "this scaling holds also for the skellam and @xmath83 distributions for sufficiently large volumes .",
    "moreover , the ratios of cumulants computed directly from the uncorrected @xmath101 data @xcite , exhibit similar systematics as the efficiency corrected ratios .",

    "we have restricted the data to those with more than 100 events .",

    "in particular , the characteristic narrowing of the probability distribution relative to the skellam function for positive @xmath92 , and early drop of the ratio below unity for @xmath105gev , are characteristic signatures for @xmath3 criticality at non - zero chemical potential .",
    "there are several potential contributions to the cumulants and the probability distribution from sources other than critical fluctuations @xcite , as well as experimental issues e.g. regarding efficiency corrections @xcite .",
    "thus , a final conclusion on the criticality of @xmath101 can be drawn only once the role of these effects has been sorted out .    in @xcite ,",
    "the cumulant ratios @xmath106 and @xmath107 are analyzed with efficiency and centrality bin width corrections . by constructing @xmath106 and @xmath107 from the uncorrected @xmath0 data discussed above , we have found that the deviations from skellam distribution are slightly smaller than that seen in the corrected ratios . however the systematics and the energy dependence is almost the same .",

    "in order to reveal the @xmath3 criticality in the net baryon number probability distribution and in the corresponding cumulants we have used the skellam distribution as a reference . the skellam function is the natural choice , since in heavy ion collisions data on particle yields , as well as the qcd thermodynamics , are well reproduced by the hadron resonance gas partition function . in the hrg , baryons multiplicity is distributed according to poisson and the net - charge distribution is then given by the skellam function .",
    "however , it has been shown that the lowest cumulants of the net proton fluctuations and the corresponding probability distributions obtained by the star collaboration are consistent also with negative binomial ( nbd ) or binomial ( bd ) distributions @xcite .",

    "<S> we compute the probability distribution @xmath0 of the net - baryon number at finite temperature and quark - chemical potential , @xmath1 , at a physical value of the pion mass in the quark - meson model within the functional renormalization group scheme . for @xmath2 , the model exhibits the chiral crossover transition which belongs to the universality class of the @xmath3 spin system in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the influence of the chiral crossover transition on the properties of the net baryon number probability distribution , @xmath0 . by considering ratios of @xmath0 to the skellam function , with the same mean and variance </S>",
    "<S> , we unravel the characteristic features of the distribution that are related to @xmath3 criticality at the chiral crossover transition . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the corresponding ratios for data obtained at rhic by the star collaboration and discuss their implications . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine @xmath3 criticality in the context of binomial and negative - binomial distributions for the net proton number .    </S>",
