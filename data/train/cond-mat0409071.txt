    "band structure calculations based on the single particle picture have enjoyed considerable success in solid state theory .",
    "single particle picture here is meant to imply that the ground state is obtained by filling up according to the pauli principle the energy levels calculated for a single electron in an ` effective potential ' .",
    "the effective potential thereby is usually constructed within the framework of the local density ( lda ) or local spin density approximation ( lsda ) to density functional theory ( dft)@xcite and despite the well - known fact that the eigenvalues of the kohn - sham equations should not be identified with the single - particle excitation energies of a system , the resulting band structures often give an almost quantitative description of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "+ however , there are also some classes of solids which defy such a description , most notably transition metal compounds with partially filled @xmath0 and @xmath1-shells and strong coulomb interaction between the electrons in these .",
    "a frequently cited example is nio , where lsda band structure calculations correctly predict an antiferromagnetic and insulating ground state , but only a small ` slater gap ' of a fraction of an ev@xcite , whereas experimentally nio is an insulator with a bandgap of 4.3 ev@xcite and stays so even above the magnetic ordering temperature . while dft thus gives reasonable answers within its domain of validity - namely ground state properties - the non - correspondence between the kohn - sham eigenvalues and the single - particle excitation energies of the solid obviously has to be taken literal for this compound ( if the band gap is not read off from the lsda band structure but expressed as the difference of ground state energies it is in fact possible to calculate it within the framework of dft , as shown by norman and freeman@xcite ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the reason for the discrepancy is the strong coulomb interaction between the electrons in the ni @xmath2-shell , which leads to a substantial energy splitting between @xmath3 configurations with different @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a very pronounced ` pinning ' of the @xmath0-shell occupation number @xmath4 , in the case of nio to the value @xmath5 .",
    "final states for photoemission or inverse photoemission then correspond to a single @xmath0-shell being in either a @xmath6 , a @xmath7 or a @xmath8 configuration , in each case with very small admixture of configurations with other @xmath4 . the corresponding ` defect ' then may be thought of propagating through the crystal with definite @xmath9 .",
    "this pinning of the electron number in both initial and final states can not be reproduced by a wave function which takes the form of a simple slater - determinant - such as the ground state deduced from the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the situation is improved somewhat in the self - interaction corrected version of dft@xcite , which renders a certain fraction of the @xmath0-orbitals completely localized , so that their occupation number in fact does become pinned - for the remaining delocalized @xmath0-orbitals , however , the problem remains . another way to achive",
    "the pinning of the @xmath0-shell occupancy is the use of an orbital - dependent potential in the framework of the so called lda+u method@xcite .",
    "speaking about gap values the calculations based on the gw - approximation@xcite also need to be mentioned - these give _ ab initio _ gap values which are in good agreement with experiment but do not seem to reproduce the high energy ` satellite ' in the photoemisison spectrum . + in addition to the pinning of the @xmath0-shell occupancy , the multiplet structure of the metal ion poses a problem for single - particle theories as well .",
    "it is quite well established that the multiplet structure ( appropriately modified by the crystal field splitting ) of the isolated metal ion persists in the solids .",
    "clear evidence for this point of view comes from the fact , that angle integrated valence band photoemission spectra@xcite as well as x - ray absorption spectra@xcite of many transition metal compounds can be reproduced in remarkable detail by configuration interaction calculations solving exactly the problem of a single @xmath0-shell hybridizing with a ` cage ' of ligands . in these calculations it is crucial , however , that the intra - shell coulomb repulsion is treated in full detail .",
    "while the cluster method is spectacularly successful for angle - integrated quantities its ` impurity ' character unfortunately makes it impossible to extract the dispersion relations of @xmath10-resolved single particle excitations .",
    "+ actual dispersion relations in the presence of strong coulomb interaction were first studied by hubbard@xcite , thereby taking an entirely different point of view as compared to the single particle picture on which conventional band structure calculations are based .",
    "thereby the @xmath0-shells first are considered as isolated , and their affinity and ionization spectra obtained , thereby treating the coulomb repulsion exactly . in his famous papers",
    "hubbard used a much simplified model , where the orbital degeneracy of the @xmath0-level was neglected whence ionization and affinity spectrum of the ` half - filled ' @xmath0-shell collapse to single peak each , with the two peaks separated by the coulomb energy @xmath11 . upon coupling the individual atoms to the solid , the ionization and affinity states of the individual atoms then",
    "are systematically broadened to form the two ` hubbard bands ' .",
    "the coupling to the solid was achieved originally by the famous hubbard i approximation , but in fact this may be interpreted as a particularly simple form of the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) , proposed by senechal _",
    "et al._@xcite , where the individual ` clusters ' consist of just a single @xmath0-shell .",
    "this suggests immediately to relax hubbard s simplifications and take into account the full complexity of a transition metal oxide including the orbital degeneracy of the @xmath0-shell , the full coulomb interaction between @xmath0-electrons in these and the sublattice of ligands .",
    "this is essentially the purpose of the present manuscript .",
    "+ an important complication is due to the sublattice of ligands",
    ". it has been shown by fujimori and minami@xcite that in discarding altogether the sublattice of ligands ( in the case of nio : the oxygen atoms ) , hubbard actually went one step to far in his simplification of the model .",
    "namely fujimori and minami showed that the top of the valence band in nio is composed of states , where a hole is predominantly in an oxygen atom , but somehow ` associated ' with an @xmath4-conserving excitation of a neighboring @xmath0-shell - i.e. a magnon or a @xmath12 exciton .",
    "this type of state might be viewed as generalization of a zhang - rice singlet@xcite in the cuo@xmath13 planes of cuprate superconductors .",
    "it was then found by zaanen , sawatzky and allen@xcite that there is a crossover between this so - called charge - transfer insulator and a more conventional mott - hubbard insulator as a function of two key parameters , the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 between electrons in the @xmath0-shell and the charge transfer energy @xmath14 , which are defined as @xmath15 strong experimental support for the picture proposed by fujimori and minami is provided by the resonance behavior of the photoemission intensity as seen in photoemission with photon energies near the @xmath16 absoption threshold@xcite . + adopting this point of view and using a simplified ` kondo - heisenberg ' model , in which the charge degrees of freedom on ni where projected out , bala _ et al._@xcite then obtained dispersion relations of quasiparticles in nio which in fact do contain the key feature seen in arpes@xcite : the coexistence of strongly dispersive oxygen bands on one hand and a complex of practically dispersionless ( i.e. : massively renormalized ) bands which form the top of the valence band on the other hand .",
    "+ in the present theory no reduction of the hamiltonian to a t - j - type model is performed .",
    "rather we use the same basic idea as in the treatment of the kondo lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite : the system is divided into sub - units which are treated exactly and the hybridization between the sub - units is treated approximately .",
    "to do so , we define the ground state for vanishing hybridization as the ` vacuum state ' and treat the charge fluctuations created by the hybridization as ` effective fermions ' , for which an approximate hamiltonian can be derived and solved .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hubbard - i approximation for the single - band hubbard model can be re - derived in this fashion if the sub - units are taken to be only a single site - including more complex ` composite particles ' which extend over several unit cells then improves the agreement with numerical results .",
    "the generalized zhang - rice singlets discussed above may be viewed as such composite particles .",
    "it is shown in appendix i of ref .",
    "@xcite that this treatment is in fact equivalent to the original cluster perturbation theory of senechal _",
    "et al._@xcite provided the sub - units into which the system is divided are non - overlapping .",
    "this last requirement poses a substantial problem for transition metal oxides , because the rocksalt lattice of nio can not be easily divided into non - overlapping sub - units which are still amenable to exact diagonalization without artificially breaking a symmetry of the lattice ( which would lead to artificial symmetry breaking in the band structure ) .",
    "we therefore need to adjust the concept of cluster perturbation theory to this situation - which also is an objective of the present work .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss a simplified 1d model , in section iii we present the general theory , in section iv we apply the theory to the 1d model and compare the obtained single particle spectra with result from exact diagonalization , in section iv we discuss the arpes spectra of nio and section v gives the conclusions .",
    "for a start we consider the following minimal version of a 1d charge transfer model ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) : @xmath17 this model describes a 1d chain consisting of strongly correlated metal(@xmath0 ) orbitals and uncorrelated ligand ( @xmath18 ) orbitals .",
    "henceforth we choose @xmath19 as the unit of energy and unless otherwise stated set @xmath20 .",
    "the relevant filling ( which we will consider henceforth ) of the model is @xmath21 electrons ( or @xmath22 hole ) per unit cell . while our goal ultimately is to study realistic models for compounds such as nio , our motivation for studying this highly oversimplified model is as follows : it is simple enough so that reasonably large clusters ( up to @xmath23 unit cells ) can be treated by exact diagonalization ( ed ) and the obtained exact results for the single - particle spectral function then can serve as a benchmark for the analytical theory .",
    "the very simple nature of the model thereby is highly desirable , because it results in a small number of ` bands ' so that the comparison with theory is more significant than e.g. in the case of nio",
    ". +     schematic representation of the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) and its parameters . ]",
    "the quantity of main interest is the photoemission and inverse photoemission spectrum , defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the type of d - orbital , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denote the @xmath28 eigen state ( eigen energy ) with @xmath4 electrons - thereby @xmath29 corresponds to the ground state .",
    "the spectral function for @xmath18-electrons is defined in an analogous way .",
    "+ to get an idea how to construct an adequate theory it is useful to compare the paramagnetic mean - field solution of the model ( i.e. with @xmath30 ) and the results of an ed calculation , see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the mean - field solution gives two bands @xmath31     single particle spectral functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 obtained by mean - field solution of the model and by exact diagonalization of a system with @xmath23 unit cells .",
    "the wave vector @xmath34 increases from the lowermost to the uppermost panel in steps of @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36-functions have been replaced by lorentzians of width @xmath37 .",
    "the part to the left ( right ) of the vertical dashed line shows @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . ]",
    "the lower ( fully occupied ) one of these has predominant @xmath18-character , the upper ( half - occupied ) one has predominant @xmath0-character . in the spectra obtained by exact diagonalization ,",
    "the @xmath18-like bands persists with an almost unchanged dispersion .",
    "this is not really surprising , because an electron in the respective state moves predominantly on the @xmath18-sublattice and thus will not feel the strong coulomb interaction on the @xmath0-sites very much .",
    "the band with predominant @xmath0-character , on the other hand disappears completely in the exact spectra .",
    "there is a diffuse band somewhat below @xmath38 and a second one at the energy @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , these two resemble the ` hubbard bands ' expected for a strongly correlated system and the respective final states have the character of an empty or doubly occupied @xmath0-orbital .",
    "in addition to these hubbard bands , however , there is a third group of peaks at energies @xmath40 which energetically is close to the @xmath18-like band , has a mixed @xmath18-@xmath0 character and which does in fact form the first ionization states of the system .",
    "its closeness to the @xmath18- band would seem to suggest that the final states have a hole predominantly on the @xmath18-sites , but it also has a significant admixture of @xmath0-weight and moreover is closer to the fermi energy than the @xmath18-like band . in the charge transfer system under consideration , the @xmath0-like band thus actually splits up into _ three bands _ , rather than the two hubbard bands which one might expect .",
    "+ despite the highly oversimplified nature of the 1d model , there is actually already a clear analogy to nio : lda bandstructure calculations@xcite produce two well - separated band complexes , the lower one ( i.e. : the one more distant from the fermi energy ) with predominant oxygen character , the upper one with ni character .",
    "this is quite similar to the mean - field solution in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the actual photoemission spectra , however , show first of all a broad structure at binding energies @xmath41 below the top of the valence band .",
    "resonant photoemission experiments@xcite show , that the final states observed in this energy range have predominantly @xmath6 character - clearly they should be identified with the @xmath0-like band at @xmath42 in our model .",
    "next , at binding energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 arpes experiments@xcite find a group of strongly dispersive bands which closely resemble the oxygen - like bands obtained from an lda band structure calculation - they obviously correspond to the dispersive @xmath18-like ` remnant ' of the free - electron band in our model .",
    "finally , the top of the valence band in nio is formed by a group of almost dispersionless bands , whereby the mixed ni @xmath6 and @xmath45 character of these states is established by resonant photoemission@xcite - these states then would correspond to the low intensity band which forms the top of the electron annihilation spectrum .",
    "the cluster calculation of fujimori and minami@xcite suggests , that these states should be viewed as hole - like ` compound objects ' where a hole on oxygen is bound to an excited state of @xmath7 - a type of state that might be viewed as a generalization of the zhang - rice singlet in the cuo@xmath13 planes of cuprate superconductors .",
    "as already conjectured by fujimori and minami their ` compound nature ' would make these quasiholes very heavy , which immediately would explain the lack of dispersion seen in the arpes spectra@xcite .",
    "finally , inverse photoemission shows the presence of an upper hubbard band in nio which is also present in the spectra of the 1d model . + the above comparison shows , that in addition to @xmath18-like holes we will need three types of ` effective particles ' to reproduce the correlated band structure of the model .",
    "the two standard hubbard bands , which correspond to @xmath46-like final states are not sufficient here .",
    "to get an idea what these states should be , let us start from the ionic limit , @xmath47 .",
    "the ground state then corresponds to a constant number of electrons , @xmath4 , in each metal @xmath0-shell and completely filled ligand @xmath18-shells , see figure [ fig10]a .",
    "switching on the hybridization integral @xmath19 then will produce charge fluctuations : in a first step , a hole is transferred into a @xmath18 orbital , thus producing a @xmath48 state in @xmath0-orbital number @xmath49 , see figure [ fig10]b .",
    "the @xmath48 state has an energy of @xmath50 relative to the original @xmath3 state , and will become our first ` effective particle ' - these ` particles ' form the unoccupied hubbard band . in a second step",
    ", the @xmath18-like hole can be transferred into a @xmath0-orbital @xmath51 , thus producing a @xmath52 state , see figure [ fig10]c .",
    "the latter has an energy of @xmath53 relative to the @xmath3 state and provides the second type of ` effective particle ' - actually the one that forms the ` satellite ' in the spectral function .",
    "finally , the hole in @xmath54 can be transferred back into a neighboring @xmath18-level , thereby leaving the orbital @xmath54 in a state @xmath55 , i.e. an eigenstate of @xmath3 other than the orginal one , see figure [ fig10]d .",
    "the ` compound object ' consisting of @xmath55 and a hole in a neighboring @xmath18-orbital will be the third type of effective particle , its energy relative to the original @xmath3 state is @xmath56 , i.e. appropriate to give top of the valence band .",
    "these states maight be viewed as generalizations of a zhang - rice singlet , or an extreme case of an ( either spin- or orbital - like ) ` kondo object ' .",
    "level repulsion due to hybridization between the @xmath52 and the @xmath57 states will push the latter up to higher energies relative to the @xmath18-like bands - in this way , these states become the first ionization states . in the following ,",
    "we will try to give the above considerations a more solid theoretical foundation and apply them to the calculation of ` correlated band structures ' .",
    "charge fluctuation processes relative to the purely ionic configuration . ]",
    "we consider a typical transition metal oxide and restrict our basis to the oxygen @xmath58-orbitals and transition metal @xmath0-orbitals . taking the energy of the @xmath18-level as the zero of energy the single - particle terms in the hamiltonian",
    "then take the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 creates a spin-@xmath61 electron in the @xmath0-orbital @xmath62 on metal site @xmath49 and @xmath63 creates an electron in @xmath18-orbital @xmath64 on oxygen site @xmath65 .",

    "the matrix - elements @xmath71 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath21 racah - parameters , @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "+ for a start we take all the hybridization matrix elements @xmath75 to be zero . in this limit",
    "each oxygen is in a @xmath76 configuration , and each transition metal ion in one of the ground states of @xmath77 with @xmath4 electrons",
    ". in general , this ground state is degenerate , and we deal with this by choosing one of these ground states , which we call @xmath78 , for each metal ion - for example in the case of @xmath79 we would choose the direction of the spin @xmath80 of the @xmath0-shell to oscillate between the two sublattices , so as to describe the antiferromagnetic order in the system .",
    "we call @xmath78 the corresponding ` reference state ' on transition metal site @xmath49 , it obeys @xmath81 . in the following , we consider the product state of the @xmath78 and the completely filled oxygen-@xmath18 sublattice as the ` vacuum ' of our theory . for the 1d model ( [ model ] )",
    "we introduce two @xmath0-sublattices @xmath72 and @xmath73 and choose latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     so as to model the antiferromagnetic spin correlations in the system .",
    "+ next , we assume that the hybridization between the sub - systems is switched on",
    ". this will create charge fluctuations in the vacuum : in a first step an electron from a @xmath18-shell will be transferred into one of the @xmath0-orbitals of the neighboring metal ion @xmath49 , a process frequently denoted as @xmath83 . due to the many - body character of the hamiltonian , the resulting state , @xmath84 , in general is not an eigenstate of @xmath85 - rather , we can express it as a superposition of eigenstates : @xmath86 are the eigenstates of the @xmath0-shell with @xmath87 electrons .",
    "since we are dealing with a single @xmath0-shell these can be obtained by exact diagonalization , which gives us the eigenenergies @xmath88 of the states @xmath89 as well as the coefficients @xmath90 .",
    "if the @xmath89 are chosen to be eigenstates of @xmath91 ( as we will assume in all that follows ) only a small fraction of the @xmath92 is different from zero .",
    "we now represent the state where the metal ion @xmath49 is in the state @xmath89 by the presence of a ` book keeping fermion ' , created by @xmath93 , at the site @xmath49 .",
    "the spin index @xmath61 thereby gives the difference in @xmath70-spin between the state @xmath89 and the reference state @xmath78 - in principle this is redundant , but we add it so as to make the analogy with a free - particle hamiltonian more obvious .",
    "an important technical point is , that in case the @xmath89 are not eigenstates of @xmath91 this labelling is not possible - there may exist states @xmath89 which can be reached by transferring an electron of either spin direction into the @xmath0-shell @xmath49 .",
    "+ all in all , the charge fluctuation process then can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath94 it is understood that states @xmath89 which have @xmath95 for both directions of @xmath61 should be omitted from this hamiltonian .",
    "one can see , that the ` bare ' hopping integrals @xmath96 are multiplied by the coefficients @xmath90 , which have a modulus @xmath97 .",
    "the effective fermions @xmath98 thus in general have a weaker hybridization with the @xmath18-orbitals than the original electrons , which will naturally lead to some kind of  correlation narrowing  of all bands of appreciable @xmath0-character .",
    "+ in the 1d model ( [ model ] ) there is only one state with @xmath87 electrons , namely the state @xmath99 this has an energy of @xmath100 , whence @xmath101 .",
    "for a site @xmath49 on the @xmath72 sublattice we thus identify @xmath102 and the part @xmath103 becomes @xmath104 plus an analogous term which describes the charge fluctuations on the sites of the @xmath73-sublattice .",
    "+ we proceed to the next type of state which is admixed by the hybridization .",
    "first , an electron from the metal - ion with @xmath87 electrons may be transferred back to the oxygen atom with the hole , i.e. @xmath105 . if the metal ion @xmath49 thereby returns to the reference state @xmath78 this process is described by the term ` @xmath106 ' in ( [ h1 ] ) . if the metal ion returns to an @xmath4-electron state @xmath107 other than @xmath78 we should model this by a bosonic excitation @xmath108 . here we will neglect these latter processes - this is presumably the strongest and least justified approximation in the present theory .",
    "it implies for example that we are neglecting ( in the case of nio ) the coupling to @xmath12 excitons and the influence of the quantum spin fluctuations ( spin waves ) in the 3d s=1 heisenberg antiferromagnet formed by the ni - moments .",
    "+ a second type of state can be generated by filling the hole in the oxygen shell @xmath65 with an electron from a @xmath0-shell @xmath51 , that means @xmath109 .",

    "we write @xmath113 ionization state by the presence of a hole - like book - keeping fermion , created by @xmath114 . in an analogous way as above",
    "we arrive at the following effective hamiltonian to describe the second type of charge fluctuation : @xmath115 since @xmath116 creates a hole - like particle , the presence of terms like @xmath117 is not unusual - these terms describe particle - hole correlations , not particle - particle correlations as in bcs theory .",
    "+ in the @xmath118 model , the only state with @xmath111 electrons is the empty site @xmath119 , which has the energy @xmath120 , whence @xmath121 .",

    "there is therefore just one @xmath139-like particle on the @xmath72-sublattice , which corresponds to site @xmath49 being in the state @xmath136 and having an extra hole in the combination @xmath140 .",
    "the total energy is @xmath141 whence @xmath142 and the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath143 and , again , a corresponding term for the @xmath73-sublattice .",
    "this concludes the types of state which we take into account .",
    "we are thus assuming that the hole always is on a nearest neighbor of the @xmath55 state - this means that we truncate the ` kondo cloud ' which is not exactly true . in principle",
    "this approximation could be relaxed by including more complex composite particles but here we do not include these .",
    "+ in order for the mapping between the actual system and the ` book - keeping fermions ' to be a faithful one , we must require that the occupation of any @xmath0-site is either @xmath144 or @xmath22 - otherwise , the state of the respective @xmath0-shell is not unique .",
    "this implies that the book - keeping fermions @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath139 have to obey a hard - core constraint , in exactly the same way as e.g. the magnons in spin - wave theory for the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) .",
    "it is well known , however , that linear spin - wave theory for the haf , which neglects this hard - core constraint alltogether and treats the magnons as free bosons , gives an excellent description of the antiferromagnetic phase , even in the case of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , where quantum fluctuations are strong .",
    "the reason is , that the density @xmath4 of magnons / site obtained self - consistently from linear spin wave theory is still relatively small , whence the probability that two magnons occupy the same site and thus violate the constraint is @xmath149 .",
    "for the same reason we expect that relaxing the constraint in the present case and treating the book - keeping fermions as free fermions will be a very good approximation - its physical content is the assumption , that the probability of charge fluctuations is small , which is certainly justified in a mott- or charge - transfer - insulator . for completeness",
    "we note that there is also a certain interference between the @xmath139 particle and the holes on oxygen in the sense that the respective creation and annihilation operators do not exactly anticommute .",
    "again , we neglect this , with the justification again being the very low density of the @xmath139 and @xmath150 particles . + adding the various terms in the hamiltonian and the direct @xmath151 hopping @xmath152 we obtain a hamiltonian which describes the lowest order charge fluctuation processes while still being readily solvable by fourier and bogoliubov transform with the result : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a band index .",
    "quantities of physical interest now can be readily calculated .",
    "let us first discuss the electron count .",
    "we assume that the reference states for the @xmath0-shell have @xmath4 electrons each .",
    "then , the total number of electrons / unit cell is @xmath155 where @xmath156(@xmath157 ) denote the number of metal ( oxygen ) atoms in the unit cell .",
    "on the other hand we have @xmath158 here the sums over @xmath65 and @xmath49 run over the @xmath18 and @xmath0-shells in one unit cell and the equation follows readily from the electron / hole - like character of the various effective fermions .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath159 where @xmath160 denotes the total number of ionization states in the unit cell which can be reached by extracting a spin @xmath61 electron from one of the @xmath78 , and and @xmath161 the total number of @xmath139-particles in the unit cell which couple to one of these ionization states .",
    "if we assume that the band structure is spin independent ( which is the case for nio ) these numbers must be independent of @xmath61 and we obtain the following requirement for the electron number : @xmath162 the number of occupied bands in the system thus is @xmath163 . since the total number of bands produced by our formalism is @xmath164 , we find that the chemical potential falls exactly into the gap between the @xmath165 bands which correspond ( in the limit of vanishing hybridization ) to the oxygen @xmath58 states , the ionization states of the @xmath0-shell and the @xmath45-type states on one hand and the @xmath166 bands , which correspond to the affinity states of the @xmath0-shells on the other hand .",

    "however , the presence of the @xmath139-like ` particle ' complicates this . due to their ` compound nature ' the processes by which the electron annihilation operator couples to a @xmath139-particle are rather complicated .",

    "if a @xmath55 state is somehow created on a site @xmath49 ( this is not possible in the framework of the hamiltonian which we wrote down above - it would necessitate terms including the bosonic excitations @xmath108 discussed above ) and a hole is created in a @xmath18-orbital next to this site , this would result in the creation of a @xmath139-like particle on site @xmath49 .",
    "this process could be described by a product of the type @xmath170 . due to the fact that these processes all involve products of three operators",
    "one might expect that they lead predominantly to an incoherent continuum in the spectral function .",
    "all in all , we may thus expect that this type of process will not contribute substantially to the photoemission intensity for the dominant peaks",

    "the simplicity of the model actually makes the comparison more significant than e.g. in the case of a realistic model for nio , because we expect only a small number of ` bands ' whence any disagreement will be more obvious .",

    "summarizing the results of the preceeding section we may say that the theory reproduces the numerical spectra and the trends under a change of parameters remarkably well , an indication that despite its simplicity the theory really captures the essential physics of the two - band model .",

    "all in all this procedure gives quite reliable estimates for the values of the various hopping integrals .",
    "the lda bandstructure broadly can be divided into two complexes of bands : the lower one at energies between @xmath192 and @xmath193 has almost pure oxygen @xmath18-character . in other words ,",
    "a hole in this bands would move almost exclusively on the oxygen sublattice and have only a very small probability to be on a ni ion .",

    "next , the complex between @xmath193 and @xmath194 has almost exclusively ni @xmath2 character .",
    "the lda band structure thus would seem to suggest , that there are states , where a hole is moving essentially from one ni site to another , which have a less negative binding energy - i.e. which are closer to the fermi energy - than the states where the hole is moving in the oxygen sublattice .",

    "could be studied in much the same way as lattice parameters are optimized in conventional lda calculations and since all ` ingredients ' for the goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite are taken into account , this may be a quite promising method .",
    "since spin - orbit coupling also can be trivially included in the exact diagonalization of the isolated @xmath0-shells one might even hope to address magnetic anisotropies and/or anisotropic exchange interactions .",

    "+ one major drawback of the theory clearly is the approximate nature of the calculation of the spectral weight .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is a very clear physical reason for this problem , namely the ` compound nature ' of the zrs - like states which form the top of the valence band .",
    "if the present interpretation of these states is the correct one , basically any theory will face similar problems .",
    "one possible way out would be to derive a version of the original cpt which can work with site - sharing clusters .",
    "+ finally , we would like to discuss the relationship between our theory and previous workers in the field .",
    "et al._@xcite and takahashi and igarashi@xcite have calculated the quasiparticle band structure of nio more along the lines of conventional many - body theory .",

    "the obtained band structures show the same ` large scale features ' as the one obtained here , but there are also significant differences , particularly so near the top of the valence band .",
    "more detailed comparison with experiment seems necessary to discuss the merits of the various theories .",

    "the present theory employs the same type of basis states as the cluster calculations .",
    "the only difference is , that we designate one of the degenerate ground states of @xmath3 as a ` vacuum state ' and interpret the other states as ` deviations ' from this vacuum state .",
    "those deviations which carry the quantum number of an electron then are considered as effective free fermions . as discussed above ,",
    "the low density of these effective fermions probably make this a very good approximation .",
    "+ there is also an obvious relationship between the present theory and the work of unger and fulde@xcite . using the projection technique developed by becker and",
    "fulde@xcite these authors constructed an equation of motion for single - particle spectral functions of the cuo@xmath13 plane , which is very similar to the ones which would be obtained from our effective hamiltonians .",
    "+ finally we address the work of bala _",
    "et al._@xcite , which is very similar in spirit to the present theory .",
    "these authors derived a ` kondo - heisenberg'-like model operating in the subspace of @xmath45 type states by eliminating - via canconical transformation - the charge fluctuations between states of the type @xmath245 and states of the type @xmath6 ( their theory was concerned with the motion of a single hole in an @xmath229 orbital ) .",
    "accordingly , their theory produced ( in addition to the free - electron - like @xmath229 bands ) two weakly dispersive bands - one for each of the ` flavours ' @xmath219 and @xmath218 whereby the flavour stands for the symmetry of the linear combination of @xmath229 orbitals around a given @xmath246 site .",

    "moreover , we also take the excited multiplets of @xmath7 and their covalent mixing with the @xmath6 multiplets into account , whence we obtain a larger number of zrs - like bands - consistent with experiment .",
    "experimentally the impact of the coupling to magnons which is ignored in the present theory but treated accurately in the work of bala _ at a. _ could be studied only by considering the ` fine structure ' of the broad peak at the valence band top .",

    "<S> we propose a many - body method for band - structure calculations in strongly correlated electron systems and apply it to nio . </S>",
    "<S> the method may be viewed as a translationally invariant version of the cluster method of fujimori and minami . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the coulomb interaction within the @xmath0-shells is treated by exact diagonalization and the @xmath0-shells then are coupled to a solid by an extension of the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) due to senechal et al . </S>",
    "<S> the method is computationally no more demanding than a conventional band structure calculation and for nio we find good agreement between the calculated single particle spectral function and the experimentally measured band structure . </S>"
