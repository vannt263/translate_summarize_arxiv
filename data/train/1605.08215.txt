    "the nature of the lowest - lying @xmath0 excited states ( denoted as @xmath3 state in the following ) in deformed nuclei has been a long standing problem in nuclear physics and studied by various approaches @xcite .",
    "traditionally they have been considered to be collective excitations such as the @xmath2-vibration@xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been calculations along this line based based on the algebraic collective model of rowe and co - workers @xcite as well as analytical solutions of the bohr hamiltonian with a certain kind of potential and a deformation - dependent mass term @xcite .",
    "there are also calculations using the interacting boson model ( ibm ) with different truncated hamiltonians @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the @xmath3 state is supposed to be a pure collective excitation , and its excitation energy can be fitted together with the yrast and the @xmath4-bands .",
    "other studies do not assume that the @xmath5 states are purely collective .",
    "for example , in the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) the @xmath5 excitations have been investigated in several rare - earth nuclei @xcite . in these",
    "works the first @xmath5 excitations are described as one - phonon states , with the result that the phonons are built by several ( not many ) two - quasiparticle configurations .",
    "a similar conclusion is also obtained in the studies of the @xmath5 excitations in @xmath6gd and @xmath7er with the projected shell model ( psm ) @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal the relevance of the two - quasiparticle states in the @xmath3 states . however , the shortcoming of the latter models is that they do not work well in transitional nuclei .",
    "recently , there has been also calculations of the low - lying excited states with the quasi - random phase approximation with skyrme forces @xcite and the five dimensional collective bohr hamiltonian with the gogny force @xcite .    in the treatment of transitional nuclei ,",
    "the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) is widely used @xcite . the gcm is a very flexible microscopic model which handles shape vibrations as the bohr hamiltonian but that at the same time allows to incorporate single particle degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been applied with great success with effective forces , like skyrme @xcite , gogny @xcite or relativistic @xcite , to consider situations where the collective degrees of freedom play a relevant role , like shape coexistence in transitional nuclei . in recent years",
    "the gcm has been used also with separable forces to calculate the first @xmath0 excitations in several gd , dy and er isotopes ( including the transitional @xmath8 isotones ) @xcite . in this work",
    "the quadrupole deformation @xmath2 is used as the generator coordinate and after projecting on angular momentum and particle number the hill - wheeler equation @xcite is solved . in these calculations",
    "the @xmath5 states are interpreted as shape vibrations .",
    "the calculated excitation energies and transition probabilities of the @xmath3 states are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , this study is restricted to isotopes with neutron number @xmath9 .",
    "an attempt to extend this study to the heavier er isotopes with @xmath10 was not successful .",
    "considering the above mentioned studies with the qpm and psm , one may guess that the failure of the gcm calculation in heavier er isotopes is due to the lack of two - quasiparticle states in the model space . with the inclusion of the two - particle states",
    ", one could at least expect results as good as the psm calculations for the heavier er isotopes with @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , there are several hints indicating that the first @xmath0 excitations in these er isotopes are not as collective as a pure shape vibration .",
    "a measurement of the lifetime of the @xmath3 excitation in @xmath11er @xcite showed that the transition probability of the @xmath3 state in this nucleus is not as large as expected for a @xmath2-vibration .",
    "the best candidate for the @xmath2-vibration in this nucleus is the third @xmath0 excited state . in @xmath7er ,",
    "the measured e2 transition probability from the @xmath3 to the @xmath12 state is also very small @xcite . the @xmath13 value of @xmath14 w.u .",
    "is much smaller than the value of tens of w.u .",
    "expected for a @xmath2-vibration @xcite .",
    "there are also some hints in this direction from the above mentioned calculations with the bohr model and the ibm . in the calculations with the bohr model , the parameters are determined by fitting the experimental spectra , and the transition rates are then calculated with these parameters .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath13 rates from the @xmath5 states are always overestimated , sometimes by one order of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that the calculated @xmath3 states are `` more collective '' than they should be . in the ibm calculations",
    "the parameters are also determined by fitting the experimental data .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the parameters determined in this way for @xmath7er do not follow the smooth trend as a function of the neutron number . however , if one assumes that the lowest collective @xmath0 excitation is the second @xmath0 excitation in @xmath7er , one would get smoothly varying parameters .",
    "this also indicates that the first @xmath0 excitation in @xmath7er may not be a collective @xmath2-vibration .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the above mentioned gcm calculation @xcite by simultaneously considering different nuclear shapes and their two - quasiparticle excitations in the gcm ansatz .",
    "we apply the new theory to perform a systematic study of the first @xmath0 excitations in the er isotopes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "since the light isotopes are very soft in @xmath2 and the heavy ones strongly deformed , it is expected that the role played by the collective and the single particle degrees of freedom as well as their coupling will be elucidated .",
    "it is expected that the inclusion of the two - quasiparticle states will improve the description of these @xmath0 states in the er isotopes with larger neutron numbers .",
    "it should be mentioned that the gcm calculation with two - quasiparticle states has been used in ref .",

    "we give a summary of our conclusion in sect.[sect4 ] .",
    "in our calculations we use the separable pairing plus quadrupole hamiltonian @xcite @xmath17 where the operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for protons and @xmath23 for neutrons ) are given by : @xmath24 with the quadrupole operator defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 runs from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .    as mentioned in the introduction as an ansatz for our wave functions we use the shape parameter @xmath2 to generate wave functions @xmath29 with this shape . for this purpose",
    "we solve the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equation with constraints on the total quadrupole moment @xmath30 and the average particle number .",
    "the wave function @xmath29 of the energy minimum for a given @xmath2 value is provided by @xmath31 with the lagrange multipliers @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 determined by the constraining conditions : @xmath35 the relation between the quadrupole operator and the deformation parameter @xmath2 is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 fm . for each hfb vacuum @xmath29",
    "there is a set of corresponding quasiparticle operators @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 the second components of our gcm ansatz are the two - quasiparticle states , defined by @xmath41 finally , the hfb vacua and the two - quasiparticle states are projected onto good angular momentum and particle number .",
    "thus the complete ansatz for our wave function has the form @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 runs over the set @xmath44 and @xmath45 labels the different states with angular momentum @xmath46 . in this calculation",
    "the axial symmetry is preserved , and each of the hfb vacua and the two - quasiparticle states has a good quantum number @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the summation over @xmath47 is omitted in eq .",
    "the projection operators in the above expression are given by @xcite : @xmath48 for the angular momentum projection , and @xmath49,\\ ] ] for the particle number projection .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the particle number projection may cause troubles in the case that the exchange terms of the interaction are neglected .",
    "for this reason in our calculations we will not neglect any term .",
    "minimisation of the energy with respect to the coefficients @xmath50 leads to the hill - wheeler ( hw ) equation @xcite @xmath51 which has to be solved for each value of the angular momentum .",
    "the gcm norm- and energy - overlaps have been defined as : @xmath52    to cope with the problem of the linear dependence one first introduces an orthonormal basis defined by the eigenvalues @xmath53 and eigenvectors @xmath54 of the norm overlap : @xmath55 this orthonormal basis is known as the natural basis and , for @xmath53 values such that @xmath56 , the natural states are defined by : @xmath57 obviously , a cutoff @xmath58 has to be introduced in the value of the norm eigenvalues to avoid linear dependences @xcite .",
    "then , the hw equation is transformed into a normal eigenvalue problem : @xmath59 from the coefficients @xmath60 we can define the so - called collective wave functions @xmath61 that satisfy @xmath62 and are equivalent to a density of probability .    concerning the number of two - quasiparticle states considered in the gcm ansatz of eq",
    ".  [ eqwf ] , in this calculation we set the following energy cutoff condition : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent the quasiparticle energies of the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "[ hfb_eq ] and @xmath71 represents the deformation of the hfb minimum .",
    "@xmath72 is the energy minimum of the potential energy as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the convergence with this cutoff has been checked and it is very good .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .  [ hamiltonian ] has been used extensively in many psm calculations with great success @xcite .",
    "we use the following strengths : the monopole pairing strength is @xmath73 , with the sign @xmath74 for neutrons and @xmath75 for protons and the quadrupole pairing strength is @xmath76 .",
    "the quadrupole - quadrupole strength can not be taken from the psm because in that approach it is fixed by the experimentally measured @xmath2 deformation and it must be adjusted separately for each nucleus , see @xcite .",
    "for the strength of the quadrupole force , we take @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 can be either protons or neutrons . for protons @xmath80 and for neutrons @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath82 with @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 is the oscillator length ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the choice of the quadrupole strength is inspired by the work of baranger and kumar , ref .",
    "these authors performed a very good analysis of the pairing plus quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "they carried out very extended calculations along the nuclide chart within different approaches .",
    "in particular they calculated ground states properties and potential energy surfaces in the hfb approach as well as in the beyond mean field approach in the framework of the bohr collective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "all these facts have contributed to the wide acceptance of the baranger kumar approach .",
    "unfortunately this model is not appropriate for some beyond mean field approaches since the single particle model space used by baranger and kumar consist of only two mayor shells and it requires the use of a core to obtain good experimental agreement .",
    "the core provides , among others , a contribution to the moment of inertia which is impossible to combine with an angular momentum projection . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with a single particle space of three shells there is no need to introduce a core . the effective charge for calculating the e2 transitions are @xmath86 for protons and @xmath87 for neutrons as in ref .",

    "large changes are found up to @xmath102 ( @xmath11er ) , for larger @xmath103 the potential energy curves look rather similar .",

    "the properties of the @xmath3 states are studied in detail .",
    "the good agreement between the calculated excitation energies of these @xmath0 states and the experimental data suggests that the two degrees of freedom , i.e. shape vibration and two - quasiparticle excitation , are sufficient for the description of these @xmath0 states .",
    "the large variation of the @xmath176 values , shown in our calculated results as well as in the measured experimental data for several neighbouring nuclei , indicates that the role played by these two degrees of freedom in the @xmath3 states are very different for different isotopes .",

    "is dominated by two - quasiparticle excitations , while the contribution from the shape vibration is almost negligible .",

    "the exception is @xmath124er in which the shape vibrations still make a larger contribution to the @xmath3 state as compared with @xmath7er .",
    "one limitation of this calculation is that the axial symmetry is preserved and the @xmath4-degree of freedom is not taken into account . as a consequence we do not have @xmath4-vibrational states in our calculations .",
    "therefore we could not study the e2 transition between the @xmath3 states to the @xmath4-vibrational state , which is also an important quantity discussed in the studies of the nature of the @xmath3 states . because of these we shall include the @xmath4 degree of freedom in our future work .",
    "we would lastly mention that a potential application of the theory would be the calculation of neutron pair transfer to investigate the @xmath150 bands @xcite .",
    "two neutron transfer in deformed nuclei is usually calculated in the hfb or qrpa theories @xcite . for deformed superfluid nuclei the particle number and the angular momentum are not conserved quantities and the use of a symmetry conserving theory like the one presented in this work may reveal important clues on the pair transfer phenomenon .",
