    "thanks to the recent experimental improvements from b factories , bes , cleo - c and hadron colliders , charm physics enters into a  golden time \" @xcite .",
    "many new charmed resonances are observed , such as @xmath4 and x , y , z states .",
    "they open a new window to study nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the last neutral meson mixing , @xmath5 mixing is observed at about @xmath6 level .",
    "this is a typical flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transition which is loop suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is expected that the fcnc process is sensitive to new physics beyond the sm . on the contrary",
    ", the leptonic decays of charm meson , e.g. @xmath7 , are tree dominated .",
    "new physics in these processes , if exists , should be very small .",
    "however , recent measurements on the leptonic decays of @xmath0 show that their ratios are larger than expectation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors reviewed the experimental and theoretical status of the decay constants of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "for most approaches to calculate the decay constant of @xmath0 , theory predictions are smaller than the experiment . in particular , there is a 3 standard deviation between the lattice qcd calculation which claims a precise prediction @xcite and the experimental data . a recent updated qcd sum rules analysis provide an upper bound which does not reduce the tension between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "the above discrepancy is sometimes called the  @xmath2 puzzle \" .    to fully understand the @xmath2 puzzle",
    ", it requires an accurate knowledge of strong interaction which is difficult to obtain at present . in this study",
    ", we explore the problem from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "although the treatment has the disadvantage that theoretical errors are not well under control , it permits an analytical treatment and its validity can be tested by many processes .",
    "our method is a light - front approach @xcite .",
    "this is a relativistic quark model and its essential element is hadron s light - front wave function . as a successful phenomenological model , it has been widely applied to calculate many different meson decay constants and form factors . within this approach , the @xmath2 puzzl problem really exists . in a previous result @xcite ,",
    "the decay constant of @xmath0 is @xmath8 mev , which is quite different from the experimental value of about @xmath9 mev . how to explain the puzzle of decay constant within the light - front approach is our first task .",
    "another possible mechanism to explain the decay constant puzzle is to introduce new physics effects beyond the sm .",
    "there have been many scenarios proposed , e.g. charged higgs and/or leptoquark @xcite . in order to explain the experiment",
    ", the new physics effects must interfere constructively with the dominant sm contribution . the charged higgs model in @xcite",
    "is excluded due to its destructive effect . here",
    ", we suggest a new physics scenario , unparticle physics @xcite . the unparticle is a scale - invariant stuff with no fixed mass .",
    "the scale dimension of the unparticle is in general fractional rather than an integral number .",
    "many unusual phenomena caused by unparticle are explored @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial phase in unparticle theory could induce constructive interference and even a sizable cp violation .",
    "some unparticle physics effects in the leptonic decays of @xmath10 are studied in @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of @xmath11 decays in unparticle physics will be provided in this study .",
    "if there exits new physics in subprocess @xmath12 transitions , it should also occur in semi - leptonic decays of charm mesons , such as @xmath13 etc .. in most literature , the semileptonic decays are either less considered or studied separately . simultaneously studying the charm leptonic and semileptonic decays may help to discriminate different new physics models . at the same time , to test the validity of light - front approach , study of the semileptonic decays is necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , the leptonic and semileptonic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in sm are given .",
    "the decay constants and the form factors are calculated within the light - front approach . in section iii",
    ", we give an analysis of leptonic decays in unparticle physics , concentring on the unparticle effects on branching ratios and direct cp violation .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      for the semileptonic decays , the quark level transition of @xmath15 is nearly the same as that in the leptonic decay except the momentum of the unparticle is not equal to that of d meson .",
    "the unparticle momentum is equal to the lepton pair momentum @xmath16 , and the amplitude of the subprocess is a^=-ie^-id _",
    "@xmath17 in the zero lepton mass limit .",
    "thus , a conclusion is obtained : the scalar unparticle contribution is helicity suppressed and vanishes for semileptonically decaying to the light lepton ( @xmath18 ) . in the leptonic decay case , because the leading sm contribution suffers the helicity suppression , the unparticle effects , although suppressed , play an important role . while for the semileptonic decay , the leading sm contribution is not suppressed .",
    "so the unpaticle effects are negligible due to helicity suppression and the weak coupling with sm particles .",
    "the vector unparticle may contribute to the semileptonic decays , but it does not enhance the ratio of the leptonic decay and can not solve the @xmath2 puzzle .",
    "we have studied the leptonic and semileptonic decays of @xmath1 and @xmath0 within sm utilizing a light - front quark model .",
    "we find that it is not difficult to solve the @xmath2 puzzle by adjusting parameter reasonably .",
    "the predictions for semileptonic decays are consistent with experiment .",
    "although the numerical results depend on the model and the theory uncertainties are not under control , the conclusion may be general and model independent .",
    "there is a sufficient space due to strong interaction uncertainties which can explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "this conclusion is different from claims from lattice qcd and qcd sum rules .",
    "we also study the leptonic decays in unparticle physics .",
    "the unparticle induces constructive interference effects which can enhance the theory to be consistent with the experiment .",
    "production of cp asymmetry at percent level is possible .",
    "this would be a clear signal for unparticle physics .",
    "we hope the future experiment can test its validity .",
    "the discrepancy between the theory and experiment becomes smaller if we use the most recent measurement from cleo collaboration with @xmath19 mev @xcite .",
    "the solution of the @xmath2 puzzle requires more accurate measurements on the leptonic and semileptonic decays of charm mesons .",
    "the future besiii will provide precise determination of @xmath0 decay constant with errors to 1% @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", there is space in sm to interpret the @xmath2 puzzle without contradictions with the other experiments .",
    "the observation of cp violation at percent level may be an ideal test of the unparticle scenario .",
