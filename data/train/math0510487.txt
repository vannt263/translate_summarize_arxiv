    "( note that @xmath106 is an interval in the natural numbers  @xmath351 : the smallest entry is the row position of @xmath352 while the largest entry is the position of the corresponding box of @xmath336 , under the bijection between @xmath13 and @xmath336 described above . )",

    "the case that @xmath334 is vexillary has been of specific interest ; see @xcite .",

    "[ cor : formulas ] let @xmath91 be a vexillary permutation and @xmath94 be the associated partition and flagging .",

    "@xmath358 @xmath359 @xmath360 here , @xmath361 is the difference of the column and row indices of the box  @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , in the last formula , @xmath104 is the tableau obtained by adding to each box  @xmath105 all entries of  @xmath362 either smaller than the entry of  @xmath107 , or larger than the entry of  @xmath107 but such that replacing @xmath107 with this larger number would not give a tableau in @xmath363 .    formally , the second formula in the corollary is obtained as follows .",

    "it was shown in  @xcite that the second formula equals the desired double grothendieck polynomial .",
    "therefore , applying the same substitution procedure to the results of proposition  [ p : kpoly1 ] and theorem  [ thm : kpoly ] yields two more formulae for the same grothendieck polynomial .",
    "these formulae are , respectively , the first and third formulae here .    in the above proof we appealed to @xcite to confirm that our -polynomials are in fact grothendieck polynomials .",
    "let us briefly sketch how this can be proved directly ; we refer the reader to @xcite for terminology . to each vexillary permutation @xmath334 there is an _ accessible box _ of @xmath13 . from this one",
    "can define two vexillary permutations @xmath367 and @xmath368 .",
    "we obtain a safe vertex of the flagged young tableau complex by removing the largest entry of @xmath369 that appears in the accessible box .",

    "the recursion from proposition  [ p : kpoly2 ] is precisely lascoux s transition formula for vexillary grothendieck polynomials  @xcite ( after the substitution @xmath370 ) .",
    "thus , since both polynomials satisfy the same recursion ( and initial conditions ) , they are equal .    specializations of these formulae are of interest .",
    "suppose we set @xmath371 for each @xmath303 and replace @xmath372 with @xmath373 for each  @xmath238 .",
    "if we assume furthermore that @xmath334 is grassmannian , then we obtain buch s formula  @xcite for the single grothendieck polynomial @xmath374 @xcite .",
    "if instead we take the lowest degree terms of the polynomial , we obtain wachs s formula for a flagged schur polynomial @xcite . making both of these specializations",
    "gives the classical tableau formula for an ordinary schur polynomial .",
    "we remark that it is also possible to use similar methods to extend these results to give set - valued skew tableau formulae for `` @xmath375-avoiding permutations '' ( see example  [ exa : skew_shape ] ) .",

    "what else sucks?*@xmath376    @xmath376*a subword complex labeled by limit semistandard tableaux*@xmath376      for completeness , we include another construction of a simplicial ball with faces labeled by ordinary ( not set - valued ) tableaux .",
    "this is based on a different grbner degeneration , of a schubert variety in the grassmannian in its plcker embedding @xcite .",
    "fix a partition @xmath13 with @xmath16 boxes .",
    "define a * hodge tableau * as a tableau @xmath71 on @xmath13 , with labels from @xmath377 with the following restriction : if we use @xmath298 , then the number of labels @xmath303 with @xmath378 must be exactly @xmath379 . also , the labels should be _ weakly _ increasing _ both _ down and to the right .",
    "one mnemonic : consider the tableau as the result of a race , where the boxes have run to the corner ; the numbers are the ranks , where multiple ties are possible .",
    "if we let @xmath380 be the set of boxes with @xmath71-label at most @xmath298 , then @xmath71 can be uniquely reconstructed from the weakly increasing sequence @xmath381 .",
    "conversely , from any strictly increasing sequence of partitions , with last entry @xmath13 , we can construct a corresponding @xmath71 .",
    "this gives a rule for labeling each chain in the lattice of partitions contained in @xmath13 , and hence each simplex in the order complex of this lattice , by a hodge tableau .",
