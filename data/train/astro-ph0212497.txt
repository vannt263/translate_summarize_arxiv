    "in the past two years , a number of experiments have produced accurate measurements of the power spectrum of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation on a range of angular scales ( hanany et al .",
    "2002 ; netterfield et al .",
    "2002 ; halverson et al . 2002",
    "; sievers et al .",
    "2002 ; benoit et al .",
    "these data , together with other cosmological observations , have been used to place increasingly tight constraints on the values of cosmological parameters in current models of the formation and evolution of structure in the universe .    in this letter",
    ", we repeat this process with the inclusion of the latest observations from the very small array ( vsa ) in its extended configuration .",
    "results from the vsa in its compact configuration have already been presented in watson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , taylor et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , scott et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and rubio - martin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( hereafter papers i - iv ) . in grainge",
    "et al . ( 2002 , hereafter paper v ) these data are combined with the new extended configuration observations to produce a combined power spectrum with 16 spectral bins spanning the range @xmath9 .",
    "this joint set of observed band - powers provides powerful new constraints on cosmological parameters . in this letter",
    "we extend the traditional likelihood approach of previous analyses to a fully bayesian treatment , including careful consideration of our knowledge of cosmological parameters prior to the inclusion of any data , and the calculation of bayesian evidences to perform model comparisons .",
    ".the priors assumed for the basic parameters common to all four cosmological models under consideration .",
    "the notation @xmath10 for parameter @xmath11 denotes a top - hat prior in the range @xmath12 [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "by comparing the effective priors on the cosmological parameters plotted in fig .",
    "[ graph - implied ] with the posterior distributions inferred from the vsa and cobe data alone ( fig .",
    "[ vsae - only ] ) , we see that the main strength of the vsa lies in its large @xmath13-range , which allows one to constrain a wide variety of cosmological parameters . in particular , we observe that the vsa data significantly improves the constraints on @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we note that , as a direct consequence of the pronounced third peak in the vsa power spectrum , the preferred value for @xmath14 is somewhat larger than that from the nucleosynthesis constraint ( burles et al .",
    "2001 ) or that from the combined cmb data .",
    "this excess is statistically significant only at the @xmath19 level .",
    "vsa and cobe data alone do not , however , provide significant new constraints on either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , especially for model b.    on comparing figs  [ vsae - only ] and [ cmb - only ] , we see that , as one would expect , the constraints on all parameters are tightened by the inclusion of all the cmb data .",
    "indeed , for model a , reasonable constraints are obtained on all the parameters under consideration , except for @xmath22 , although there is some indication that low values of @xmath22 are preferred .",
    "for many of the parameters , the constraints are not significantly broader when one allows the spatial curvature to vary in model b. nevertheless , for this model , some parameters do become relatively unconstrained , in particular @xmath20 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 , and the limits on the age of the universe are widened considerably .    using all recent available cosmological data sets allows one to place tight constraints on nearly all parameters , even for model b. indeed , only @xmath22 remains relatively unconstrained , but the earlier indication that lower values are preferred appears to be reinforced .",
    "we note that , aside from the parameters @xmath20 and the age of the universe , the constraints obtained are very similar for model a and model b. in fact , from table  [ results ] , we see that , even for models c and d , the constraints on the parameters plotted in fig .",
    "[ all - only ] are not significantly broadened . in fig .",
    "[ extrapars ] , we also plot the constraints obtained on the additional parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for model d. we see that the data favour low values of @xmath24 and high values of @xmath25 .",
    "more significant constraints can be placed on @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we note from the figure that the marginalised distribution for each parameter possesses a single peak , although these are not pronounced features , especially for @xmath26 .",
    "of particular interest is that the preferred value of @xmath27 corresponds to a cosmological constant and that a firm upper limit is obtained on the fraction of dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos .    to distinguish between the different cosmological models considered here ,",
    "we have calculated the bayesian evidence for each model - data set combination .",
    "it must be remembered that evidence values can only be compared between different models using the same data set . from table  [ results ] , we see that , for each data set , model a ( i.e. the simple 6-parameter @xmath28cdm cosmology ) is preferred , although the evidence ratio between model a and model b is of order unity in each case . for models c and d , however , the evidence ratio with model a is considerably larger and shows clearly that such general models are not necessary to explain current cosmological observations .    since model a",
    "is found to have the largest evidence , it is of interest to consider more closely the impressively tight parameter constraints that can be achieved in this simple case using all the available cosmological data . in particular , let us focus on @xmath20 and @xmath14 , which are parameters directly probed by the hst key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and nucleosynthesis data ( burles et al .",
    "2001 ) . in fig .",
    "[ hbbn ] , we plot the posterior distributions of these parameters for model a , with ( thick line ) and without ( thin line ) the corresponding direct constraint ( dashed line ) . in each case",
    ", we see that the direct constraint is overwhelmed by the combination of the other data sets .",
    "it is clear from the above analyses that the constraints on the parameters in the simplest models become impressively small when a wide range of cosmological probes are used .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , whether this level of precision is matched by a corresponding level of accuracy in the values determined .",
    "the model comparison exercise demonstrated here does not address the possibility that different experiments have different systematic errors .",
    "nevertheless , one would hope that these might be reduced when many experiments are combined . in future work , we will investigate other models , with different combinations of free and fixed parameters and perform a hyperparameter analysis ( hobson et al .",
    "2002 ) to reveal any discrepancies between data sets .",
