    "different from other fundamental quantities such as mass and charge , spin is a dynamical quantity , and its dynamics have been widely studied and applied in science and technology . in particular , recent rapid growth of spintronics provides a stage where deeper understandings of spin dynamics directly lead to practical applications .",
    "the dynamics of spin are governed by the spin berry phase @xcite , and its equation of motion includes only the first - order time derivative of spin .",
    "this is natural because spin is an angular momentum and its equation of motion takes the familiar form : the time - derivative of the angular momentum ( i.e. spin ) is given by the torque acting on it . without any torque , the solution of the equation of motion of spin is only a static one .",
    "this is in contrast with , for example , the case of a massive point particle , which has inertia and can move at non - zero speed as its free motion . in this sense , spin does not have inertia .",
    "however , for systems where spin interacts with other environmental degrees of freedom , spin dynamics are affected by those environmental degrees of freedom , and the dynamical law of spin is changed to be an effective one .",
    "for example , in metallic ferromagnets , conduction electrons affect the dynamics of localized spins ( i.e. spins of atoms on lattice cites ) .",
    "a typical effect is spin - damping ( e.g. @xcite ) , where the energy and the angular momentum of spins are transferred to the environmental degrees of freedom and , as the result , spins relax to their ground state within a certain time scale . without this effect ,",
    "spins undergo the larmor precession around the applied magnetic field forever . in this respect , the existence of the degrees of freedom other than spins changes the dynamical behavior of spins significantly . in the equation of motion of spins ,",
    "this damping is represented by the gilbert damping term @xcite .",
    "this damping term includes only the first - order time derivative of spins .",
    "therefore , spin still does not have inertia even when we take into account the gilbert damping effect .",
    "the effects of the environments other than the gilbert damping can be studied systematically by the derivative expansion , where the effects are expanded in powers of the time ( and spatial ) derivative of spin . from that point of view",
    ", the gilbert damping term gives the leading order term in that expansion . in the higher orders , there appear terms which include the second - order time derivative , the third - order time derivative and so on , in the equation of motion of spin .",
    "these terms with higher order time derivatives are interesting in that , like the gilbert damping term , they change the dynamical law of spin itself , more than give additional torque on spin . in particular , from a comparison with the form of the newton s equation of motion of a massive point particle , the term with the second - order time derivative of spin plays the role of the inertia of spin .",
    "such spin inertia has been discussed in the literature ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "recent progress in ultrafast magnetization @xcite motivated several works . in refs.@xcite , the inertia of spin",
    "was introduced phenomenologically and was shown to give additional nutation to the motion of spin .",
    "the time scale where the effect of the inertia is significant was discussed , based on the work of brown @xcite , to be sub - picosecond order . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the equivalence between the dynamics of spin with inertia and a spinning top was discussed .",
    "microscopic derivation of spin inertia was performed in refs.@xcite and @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "an extended breathing fermi surface model was used , and the relation between the gilbert damping coefficient and the spin inertia was given in terms of physical quantities ( such as fermi - dirac occupation numbers ) of conduction electrons . the time scale for the nutational motion to be damped by the gilbert",
    "damping was estimated to be sub - picosecond order . in ref.@xcite , a general expression of the contribution of the conduction electrons to spin dynamics",
    "was discussed .",
    "the spin effective dynamics was shown to be non - local in general , which can be approximated as local dynamics by the derivative expansion of spin .",
    "the inertial term of spin arises in that derivative expansion and its general expression was given in term of the green s function of the conduction electrons .",
    "since the inertia of spin is conceptually interesting in its own and gives the first step toward the understanding of non - adiabatic contribution of environmental degrees of freedom to spin effective dynamics , further investigations are worthwhile .",
    "although the expressions of the inertia of spin were given as integral forms @xcite , an explicit expression of the inertia of spin in terms of parameters of a model has not been obtained so far .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the inertia of spin on the dynamics of spin has been discussed only for spatially homogeneous spin system under time - independent magnetic field . in this paper , we present detailed theoretical study of the effects induced by the spin inertia based on an @xmath4 model . in section [ sec : effective action ] , we derive a concrete expression of spin inertia in terms of the parameters in the @xmath4 model . in section [ sec :",
    "spin and spinning top ] , the basic behavior of spin with finite inertia is studied with the help of its two equivalents : a symmetric spinning top and a massive charged particle on a sphere subject to a monopole field . in section [ sec : phenomena ] , we study spatially inhomogeneous system , and discuss that spin waves and magnetic domain walls acquire an additional oscillation mode due to spin inertia .",
    "we also study the behavior of spin under large and time - dependent magnetic field , and find an unusual behavior of spin where the velocity of spin is parallel to the direction of the time - derivative of magnetic field .",
    "the inertia of spin arises naturally in its effective dynamics , which takes into account the effects of the environmental degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "consider a system where a classical field of localized spin , @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 fixed ) , and a field @xmath7 representing the other environmental degrees of freedom are interacting with each other . for concreteness , we consider the case of metallic ferromagnets in this paper .",

    "the difference stems from the form of the metric in the dimensionally reduced direction .",

    "since the classical dynamics of spin with inertia and of a spinning top are equivalent , spin with inertia behaves in the same manner as a spinning top does ( fig.[fig : free precession and nutation ] ) .",

    "this gives the typical time scale for the inertial term , @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we mention that usual spin with zero inertia , @xmath165 , can be regarded as follows .",
    "it corresponds to the case of @xmath166 under replacements .",
    "this means that the other principle moment of inertia , @xmath167 , vanishes since , for an actual rigid body , any one of the principle moments of inertia is equal to or less than the sum of the other two , e.g. , @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "thus , setting @xmath169 leads to @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , there does not exist a spinning top corresponding to spin with zero inertia , in a non - relativistic framework . 0",
    "the free motion of a symmetric spinning top is precessional motion of its symmetric axis .",
    "this precession is intrinsic to the system in that it occurs without any external force .",
    "when external force such as the gravitational field is applied , this precession is moved as a whole in direction perpendicular to both the applied force and the radial direction of the center of the precession .",
    "the precession is called nutation especially when such external force is applied .",
