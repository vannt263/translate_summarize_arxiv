    "the development of sources of intense ultra - short electromagnetic ( em ) pulses , x - rays , and even @xmath0-rays is an important potential application of intense laser matter interactions @xcite .",
    "such applications vary from single molecule imaging to radiography of dense targets and medicine diagnostics , and provide the opportunity to study the fundamental effects not available before , such as the effects of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "one of the most promising ways to generate such sources is the use of a reflection of em radiation from a flying relativistic mirror .",
    "this was first studied by einstein in @xcite as an example of lorentz transformations .",
    "the radiation frequency up - shift is proportional to the square of the mirror lorentz factor , making the scheme very attractive for the generation of high frequency pulses .",
    "the principal idea of the relativistic plasma mirror has existed for a long time @xcite .",
    "recently several ways to create such mirrors have been proposed .",
    "one way is to use the plasma waves in the wakefield of a high intensity pulse as it travels through low density plasma in the wave breaking regime @xcite .",
    "the incoming light is reflected by these waves in the form of a compressed pulse with an up - shifted frequency ( demonstrated in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "moreover additional intensification comes from the parabolic form of the wake wave @xcite , which focuses the reflected radiation .",
    "the role of the counterpropagating electromagnetic pulse can be provided by different nonlinear structures in plasma , left in the wake of another pulse , such as solitons , electron vortices , or a wakefield . in this case",
    "the breaking plasma wave will reflect a part of their electromagnetic energy in the form of a single - cycle ultra - short high frequency pulse @xcite .",
    "another potential method is the interaction of intense linearly polarized electromagnetic pulses with solid density plasma , where either sliding @xcite or oscillating mirrors @xcite can be formed .",
    "the part of the incoming pulse that is reflected carries high order harmonics due to the oscillation of the reflecting surface either in the transverse or longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "it was proposed recently that relativistic mirrors can be formed in the regimes of laser - thin foil interaction previously considered in regard with the ion acceleration : in the first case the laser pulse is intense enough to separate the electrons from the ion core , so that the electrons will move in front of the pulse , forming a dense relativistic electron layer . the counterpropagating laser pulse upon reflection from such a mirror will undergo compression and frequency up - shift @xcite . in the second case a double - sided relativistic mirror is formed .",
    "one side is used for the energy transfer from the laser pulse that accelerates the foil . while the other side can be utilized to reflect the incoming radiation to produce ultra - short high frequency pulses @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we propose a more realistic mechanism of generation of ultra - short em pulses in laser - solid density target interaction , then previously discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "sice it represents a more general scenario of ultra - short pulse generation in laser - thin foil interaction . in the proposed scheme",
    "the ultra - short em pulses are created in the course of a counterpropagating laser pulse interaction with a series of flying electron layers , _",
    "i.e. _ the relativistic multilayer reflection ( rmr ) mechanism .",
    "such layers are produced when an intense laser pulse interacts with a thin solid density target and extracts and accelerates thin electron layers @xcite .",
    "the high density and relativistic velocity of these electron layers make it possible that such structures will reflect the incoming radiation , acting as flying mirrors .",
    "since the incident pulse experiences the relativistic multilayer reflection , such interaction will result in the generation of an ensemble of ultra - short pulses .",
    "moreover this scheme can lead to a significant energy gain by reflected radiation due to the momentum transfer from flying layers . in what follows we first present the results of 2d pic simulation of the proposed mechanism and",
    "then a 1d analytical model is employed to analyze the results .",
    "in our numerical model with the 2d pic code remp ",
    "relativistic electromagnetic particle - mesh code based on the particle - in - cell method @xcite the generation of ultra short pulses by reflection from the series of laser accelerated dense electron layers is studied in high - intensity laser interaction with ultra - thin targets .",
    "the targets are composed of fully ionized carbon c@xmath1 with an electron density of @xmath2 .",
    "the grid mesh size is @xmath3/200 , space and time scales are given in units of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , the simulation box size is @xmath5 , where @xmath3 and @xmath6 are high - intensity laser wavelength and frequency respectively .",
    "the number of particles per cell is 225 .",
    "the @xmath7 pw laser pulse which generates flying electron layers is introduced at the left boundary and propagating along x axis from left to right . the pulse is linearly polarized along the y axis ( p - polarization ) , tightly focused ( @xmath8 ) , and has gaussian transverse and longitudinal profiles .",
    "the duration of the pulse is 30 fs .",
    "the counterpropagating laser , which is reflected from the relativistic mirrors , is introduced at the right boundary and propagates from right to left along the x axis .",
    "it is polarized along the z axis ( s - polarization ) in order to distinguish between the radiation generated by the accelerating pulse and the reflected one .",
    "it has @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and duration of 15 fs .",
    "below we present the results of 2d pic simulations for the cases of a mass limited target and a thin foil ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the first case",
    "the counterpropagating laser pulse is reflected from the flying electron layers accelerated from a disk with diameter @xmath11 and thickness @xmath12 placed at @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ before the focus of the accelerating pulse , which is focused at @xmath14 ( figs .",
    "such configuration is chosen in order to show the formation of flying electron layers without a transverse flow of electrons towards the irradiated spot and obtain a more regular group of flying electron layers . in the second case",
    "the pulse interacts with a @xmath12 thick foil placed at the focus ( @xmath15 ) of the accelerating pulse .",
    "the electron density distributions at @xmath16 are shown for both cases in figs .",
    "1a and 1d .",
    "the thin electron layers that act as flying relativistic mirrors can clearly be seen .",
    "the density of these layers vary from @xmath17 to @xmath18 for the mass limited targets and from @xmath19 to @xmath20 for the thin foil .",
    "the duration of these bunches is about @xmath21 as .",
    "ccccc & & & & + 5.5 cm & & 5.5 cm & &",
    "let us estimate the properties of the flying electron layer using a simple 1d model .",
    "as we have seen from the results of 2d pic simulations the electron layers are generated by the consecutive maxima and minima of the laser electric field .",
    "the number of electrons per flying layer can be obtained from the requirement that the coulomb attraction force should be greater than the lorentz force exerted by the em field on these electrons . since",
    "all the extracted electrons almost instantly become relativistic , @xmath22 , the lorentz force is proportional to laser electric field . or in terms of fields , the laser field should be greater than the charge separation field , @xmath23 , which is generated after the extraction of electrons ( @xmath24 is the foil thickness , @xmath25 is the density of evacuated electrons ) .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath26 , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a condition for thin foil transparency .",
    "here @xmath27 is the amplitude of a vector potential in the corresponding maxima or minima of the field , @xmath28 is the critical plasma density , and @xmath3 in the laser wavelength .",
    "here we should note that the density of evacuated electrons is @xmath29 if @xmath30 , otherwise all the electrons are evacuated and @xmath31 .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , this condition does not take into account the fact that each electron layer , escaping the attraction of the ion core , increases the charge separation field that should be compensated for by the laser pulse field .",
    "let us approximate the field of the laser as @xmath32\\cos[2\\pi t / t]$ ] , where @xmath33 is the half of the duration of the pulse and @xmath34 is the period of the em wave .",
    "the maxima and minima of such a wave are at @xmath35 , @xmath36 . then for some field maximum @xmath37 the charge separation field that already exists is determined by @xmath38 .",
    "then the number of electrons evacuated is @xmath39 , here @xmath40 is the radius of the irradiated area .",
    "the total number of evacuated electrons will be @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ is determined by the maximum of the vector potential only .",
    "here we also assume that @xmath42 , otherwise @xmath43 .",
    "let us estimate the duration of an electron bunch .",
    "the extraction of electrons begins only when @xmath44 and stops at the top of the current laser cycle @xmath45 .",
    "then the time interval @xmath46 that determines the duration of the bunch can be found by solving the equation @xmath47 : @xmath48\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the duration is minimal at the maximum of the pulse ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 and increases with the increase of @xmath51 . for a laser pulse with @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "fs the electron bunch has an attosecond duration : @xmath54 as , which is in an agreement with the results of 2d pic simulations as well as the number of electrons per bunch .",
    "such thin flying electron layers can reflect the conterpropagating radiation in the form of short pulses with up - shifted frequency .",
    "the generation of ensembles of such em pulses through the rmr mechanism is demonstrated in figs 1b and 1e . in order to determine the properties of flying electron layers and determine lorentz factors of mirrors the distributions of electrons in ( @xmath55 ) phase plane",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "1c and 1f for @xmath56 . the formation of flying relativistic mirrors with @xmath57 can clearly be seen .    in order to characterize the generation of ultra - short em pulses we show the results of spatial fourier analysis of reflected ( curve 1 ) and incident ( curve 2 ) radiation in fig . 2 for the case of the mass limited target .",
    "the calculations are preformed for the field along the line @xmath58 at @xmath59 , when the maximum frequency radiation can be resolved on our grid .",
    "as the interaction evolves we expect further frequency up - shifting based on our theoretical model .",
    "it can be clearly seen that high - frequency radiation is generated as a result of counterpropagating pulse reflection from flying electron layers .",
    "the spiky structure of the spectrum can be a consequence of the regular distribution of reflecting electron layers in space ( see fig .",
    "let us estimate the reflection coefficient of the flying electron layer to determine the efficiency of short pulse generation mechanism . in order to do so we perform lorentz transformation to the reference frame co - moving with the electron layer and use the results of ref.@xcite , where the interaction of an em wave with a thin foil was considered and the reflection ( @xmath60 ) and transmission ( @xmath61 ) coefficients were obtained . here",
    "@xmath62 ( since @xmath63 ) is the parameter governing the transparency of the foil in the co - moving with the foil frame and @xmath64 is the transparency parameter of the electron layer in the laboratory frame @xcite . since it is essential for our mechanism that the flying electron layers remain unperturbed by counterpropagating pulse we take the intensity of such pulse to be relatively small .",
    "let us estimate the intensification of the laser pulse reflected by such a mirror .",
    "for the incident laser intensity , @xmath65 , the reflected pulse in the laboratory frame will have the up - shifted frequency by a factor of @xmath66 and the increased intensity @xmath67 or in terms of energy @xmath68 for @xmath69 the reflection coefficient tends to unity and reflected intensity end energy are determined by the lorentz factor alone . in the second case , @xmath70",
    ", the foil moves so fast that it becomes increasingly transparent for incoming radiation and the energy of the reflected pulse is limited by the transparency parameter .",
    "thus the efficiency of the light intensification is determined by @xmath71 for intensity and @xmath72 for energy .",
    "this means that the maximum intensity increase is determined by the properties of the accelerated foil . in order to illustrate the results of the theoretical model we chose @xmath73 and @xmath74 as parameters to estimate the reflected pulse intensity .",
    "these numbers come from the results of 2d pic simulations .",
    "the frequency up - shift in this case is @xmath75 and for @xmath53 fs the period of the reflected radiation will be @xmath76 as .",
    "then the intensity is @xmath77 w/@xmath78 .",
    "as we have shown the energy of the reflected from the flying electron layer em pulse is limited by @xmath79 , if we consider the dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "however there is a way to increase the energy of reflected radiation by utilizing the fact that the accelerating laser pulse extracts multiple electron layers from the target .",
    "moreover this type of reflection is realized in the results of 2d pic simulations presented above ( see figs 1a and 1d ) . the counterpropagating pulse experience relativistic multilayer reflection giving rise to an ensemble of ultra - short pulses .",
    "while the number of photons reflected at each layer , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the number of photons in the counterpropagating pulse ) can be small , the multiple layers will reflect almost all incoming photons , @xmath82 .",
    "if the number of layers is @xmath83 , then the total number of reflected photons @xcite is @xmath84.\\ ] ] here we assumed for simplicity that all electron layers are the same .",
    "then in terms of energy @xmath85\\mathcal{e}_0.\\ ] ] if @xmath86 then @xmath87 . in the limit @xmath88 the reflected back energy equals to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. _ all the counterparpagating radiation is reflected .",
    "the energy gain is due to the momentum transfer from the flying electron layers to the reflected radiation .",
    "for the parameters of the electron layers obtained in simulations ( the average density and duration of about @xmath91 and 60 as , the number of layers is equal to 4 ) the reflection coefficient is 0.05 and the energy gain is 1.5 , according to ( [ energy gain ] ) .",
    "we can estimate the actual energy gain in the results of 2d pic simulations from the spectra of incident and reflected radiation by integrating @xmath92 over @xmath93 .",
    "this gives a 1.07 energy gain .",
    "this clearly shows that the proposed mechanism of rmr generation of ultra - short pulses leads to an energy gain of reflected radiation due to the momentum transfer from flying mirrors .",
    "further intensification can possibly be achieved by focusing by some external means the reflected pulse into a diffraction limited spot . for a single pulse it will lead to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the reflected pulse width before focusing and @xmath96 .",
    "then for the parameters of the flying layer used above , @xmath97 and @xmath98 w/@xmath78 the resulting intensity will be of the order of the intensity characteristic for the effects of nonlinear qed , _",
    "i.e. _ schwinger intensity , @xmath99 w/@xmath78 , @xcite . at this intensity",
    "the probability of one of the most profound processes of nonlinear qed , the @xmath100 pair production in vacuum by strong em field , becomes optimal .",
    "we should note here that the plane em wave does not produce pairs in vacuum @xcite , because in this case both field invariants , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , are equal to zero , which is not the case for the focused pulse @xcite .",
    "thus the focusing of high frequency pulses to ultra - high intensity will provide a unique opportunity to study both the @xmath100 pair production by a focused em pulse and its dependence on frequency of the pulse @xcite .",
    "in this letter we considered a new way to generate ultra bright high intensity x - rays and gamma - rays by reflecting em pulse from the relativistic mirror . in the proposed scheme the role of the flying mirror is taken by laser accelerated electron layers , which are formed in the process of the intense laser pulse interaction with thin solid density targets .",
    "the reflected pulses have an up - shifted frequency and increased intensity .",
    "the reflected pulse intensification is determined by a combination of two parameters : the lorentz factor of the flying electron layer , @xmath0 , and its transparency parameter , @xmath103 , @xcite .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath104 and for given density of the plasma slab the energy of the reflected pulse multiplication factor can not exceed @xmath105 .",
    "it is due to the fact that for @xmath106 the fast moving plasma slab becomes increasingly transparent for the incoming radiation and the amplitude of the reflected pulse drops , limiting the energy gain .",
    "further intensification of the reflected light can possibly be achieved by its focusing into a diffraction limited spot that will bring the resulting peak intensity well into the domain of nonlinear qed with laser systems , which are presently available .",
    "we showed that there is a way to increase the energy transfer from the accelerated layers to the reflected radiation by utilizing the relativistic multilayer reflection .",
    "the counterpropagating em pulse interacts with multiple flying electron layers , producing an ensemble of ultra - short pulses with an energy scaling of @xmath66 .",
    "this fact leads to the conclusion that this mechanism of ultra - short pulse generation provides a highly efficient way of transforming the incoming pulse into high frequency radiation through the relativistic multilayer reflection .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation through the frontiers in optical and coherent ultrafast science center at the university of michigan and russian foundation for basic research .",
