    "fabricating complex shapes by folding or pleating a two - dimensional elastic manifold has recently emerged as a viable technological paradigm , applicable over a large range of length scales , from microns to nanometers  @xcite .",
    "a number of these innovative ideas are equally applicable for atomic crystals or for larger assemblies involving functionalized colloidal particles joined together using polymer tethers  @xcite or micron - sized lipid droplets  @xcite . to make such attempts feasible",
    ", one needs efficient ways to control local structural properties , preferably in a reversible way .",
    "thus , microscopic understanding of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics of these or similar local shape changes would be valuable .",
    "in this paper , we study in detail equilibrium and dynamic aspects of a transition in a tethered network of colloidal particles  from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous phase containing an ordered arrangement of _",
    "pleats_. within these pleats , the network penetrates itself , with parallel rows of vertices folding back to completely or nearly overlapping adjacent rows .",
    "these complex structures arise here _ spontaneously _ as a result of an underlying , equilibrium `` first - order '' phase transformation  @xcite .",
    "we show that pleating excitations are induced and controlled by a novel external field conjugate to a collective variable  @xcite defined as follows . in earlier work",
    ", it was demonstrated that local displacements of particles in a crystal away from their ideal positions may be decomposed into affine and non - affine components  @xcite .",
    "external stress couples to the affine part of the displacements . in analogy",
    ", one imagines an external field , which is conjugate to a global collective coordinate @xmath0 , measuring non - affineness , to be defined explicitly later .",
    "this `` non - affine '' field , @xmath1 , is realisable experimentally for colloidal solids using dynamic laser traps  @xcite . for small @xmath2 , non - affine displacements , and consequently @xmath0 ,",
    "are enhanced in a controlled manner computable within a linear response framework . in a non - bonded conventional crystal",
    ", this leads to the creation of defects  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an analysis of the consequences of large positive @xmath1 in a connected network much beyond the linear response regime .",
    "we consider a periodic lattice of point vertices in two dimensions ( 2d ) that are connected to their nearest neighbours by harmonic springs .",
    "crystalline 2d networks have been studied extensively in the past  @xcite , partly because of their biological significance ( e.g.  as a simple model for the spectrin network in red blood corpuscles )  @xcite .",
    "note that such a network has non - trivial properties , such as the presence of pleats , only when the bond length is random or exceeds the nearest neighbour distance set by the density  @xcite by a critical amount . in this case",
    "the network suffers an instability and catastrophic collapse .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the equilibrium first order transition  @xcite in the presence of @xmath1 ( and zero external stress ) to an _ ordered _ pleated state that we describe , we believe for the first time , in the present work . for this transition",
    ", we obtain the relative free energies of the pleated phases as well as individual free energy barriers in quantitative detail  a first but essential step towards efficient control over their formation .",
    "we use two distinct particle - based simulation techniques for this study .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite in combination with sequential umbrella sampling ( sus )  @xcite are used to compute the free energy landscape as a function of @xmath0 at various values of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that sus - mc simulations are able to detect metastable phases which are inaccessible by conventional mc .",
    "free energies of interfacial structures between pleated and un - pleated regions of the lattice can also be investigated and energy barriers for the formation of the product phase determined .",
    "this advanced sampling method ( sus - mc ) allows us to not only identify this as a first order phase transition but also to characterise the properties of the coexisting states separated by interfaces .",
    "this latter point is remarkable because we obtain explicitly an interface between an inhomogeneous state ( i.e.  the pleated state ) and the normal crystal .",
    "locating this interface is nontrivial and requires the computation of local stresses .",
    "we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite at constant particle number , total area and temperature ( nat ) to reveal the kinetic aspects of this transition . in the md simulation",
    ", the transformation shows features that are different from the thermodynamic first - order transition , as seen in sus - mc .",
    "the transformation occurs at a larger value of @xmath1 and leads to a _",
    "metastable _ phase .",
    "we show , in this work , the strong interplay between kinetics and thermodynamic phase behaviour .",
    "the equilibrium pleated states are heterogeneous phases which are quite difficult to realise via a kinetic pathway .",
    "conversely , the nature of the metastable states obtained in the kinetic transition can only be understood if one is able to identify the underlying phase transition through sus - mc .",
    "we have carried out the simulations for both the pure , non - self avoiding network as well as a model where the vertices of the network are decorated with finite - sized colloidal particles . on a qualitative level ,",
    "the findings for both models are similar .",

    "the average stress value in the pleated region where the stress is localized is similar to that of the homogeneous m1 phase .",
    "all this is reflected in the snapshots corresponding to the two - phase region ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ) .",
    "now the interfaces between the coexisting phases are clearly visible ( dashed red lines in the plot of configuration c1 , c2 and c3 ) . while in the m1 phase stress",
    "is distributed throughout the crystal , in the m2 phase , it is eliminated from the un - pleated part and concentrated mostly at the pleat .",
    "there are two interfaces due to periodic boundary conditions and the amount of the two phases at a given state is controlled by the lever rule . consequently , the free energy decreases linearly from state c1 to c3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , although the total area of the interfaces is constant for these three states . in the periodically repeated system , the m2 phase becomes a vertical stripe of undistorted network punctuated by a parallel array of horizontal pleats at regular intervals .",
    "thermal undulations along the interfaces are also visible . in summary ,",
    "[ fig5 ] demonstrates that the order parameter of the transition from the homogeneous crystal to one with stress localisation within pleats can be connected to distribution of local stresses .",
    "we end this section with a comment on @xmath179 from our simulations .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] suggests that the @xmath184 symmetry is broken at @xmath185 . to obtain a complete description",

    "how can such configurations form dynamically ?",
    "we turn now to study this kinetic transition .",
    "we have mentioned before that pleated configurations imply a multi - valued displacement field .",
    "obviously , such a configuration can not be represented as a linear combination of hydrodynamic phonon fluctuations of the network .",
    "pleated configurations therefore need to form by the nucleation and growth of non - hydrodynamic , localized droplets .",
    "incomplete pleated regions surrounded by a strained network have been observed and described in detail in the last subsection ( see for example the c1 configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . for values of @xmath1",
    "at which pleated states become globally stable , such droplet configurations , which lie in the saddle region in - between minima corresponding to un - pleated and pleated states cost extremely high free energy .",
    "such high barriers prevent the equilibrium transition from occurring in md simulations .",
    "a dynamical transition at @xmath148 to a pleated configuration is possible only when @xmath1 becomes sufficiently large so that the lattice is close to being ( but not quite ! ) locally unstable and the free energy barrier is substantially reduced . in fig .",
    "[ md - sus]b , we have plotted @xmath1 against @xmath188 obtained from sus - mc .",
    "the @xmath188 values were obtained by a histogram reweighting method . together with these results",
    ", we have also plotted results from md simulations of the same network where @xmath188 now represents an average over the md simulation time .",
    "the md and the sus - mc results both show a jump in @xmath188 at the pleating transition",
    ". however , the transition in md occurs at a much larger value of @xmath1 showing that for a large range of @xmath1 , the un - pleated state remains metastable .",
    "note also that the value of @xmath188 in the un - pleated state just before the dynamical transition is roughly equal to the value at the saddle point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . a lindemann like criterion  @xcite viz .",
    "@xmath189 just below the transition in the crystal phase is thus operative at this kinetic transition .",
    "finite size effects in the md simulations roughly follow those in the mc consistent with the shift of the position of the saddle point to smaller @xmath0 values ( see fig .  [ fig3]*b * ) with increasing @xmath4 .     as function of @xmath188 for both sus - mc and md simulations . *",
    "b. * and * c. * configurations with vertices coloured according to @xmath160 and @xmath190 obtained after the dynamical transition at @xmath191 .",

    "[ md - sus]*b * as both local @xmath113 and @xmath182 maps .",
    "while pleated regions of higher local stress similar to the sus - mc results are also seen here , the arrangement of the pleats is disordered .",
    "close examination of the configurations also suggests that some of the pleated regions are amorphous .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "as soon as the thermal energy required to cross the free energy barrier is available , the solid begins to form local pleats . since many equivalent pleated states are equally stable at these high values of @xmath1 deep within the equilibrium phase boundary , the solid locally chooses between the several degenerate pleated states and relaxes , typically , to the nearest metastable free energy minimum .",
    "further relaxation to the true equilibrium ground state , however , now needs large scale rearrangements of the network . as a consequence , the pleated solid shows ageing dynamics .    to show this",
    ", we compute the overlap function @xmath192 for all vertices with local @xmath193 .",
    "the weight function @xmath194 is zero or @xmath195 depending on whether @xmath196 or @xmath197 , with @xmath198 being some predetermined length , smaller than the lattice spacing @xmath49 ; we choose @xmath199 . for a fixed value of @xmath200 ,",

    "if one thinks of the vertices as colloidal particles , then one might construct such a system experimentally and apply the non - affine field @xmath1 using dynamic laser traps in the fashion described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite of course , colloidal particles are self - avoiding and will have an excluded volume .",
    "this should alter the properties of the pleats .",
    "does it also suppress the pleating transition completely ?",
    "we now show that while the detailed configuration of the pleats are affected because particles can not overlap , this does not change any of the equilibrium or dynamic results substantially . while a complete overlap is impossible , particles occupy positions determined by a compromise between the bonding and the non - bonding , hard - core repulsion .",

    "[ fig11]*a * , we plot the probability distribution @xmath149 for a single value of @xmath212 , close to but lower than the value at the equilibrium transition .",
    "the nature of this curve is very similar to its counterpart for the non - self avoiding lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . however , the pleated states are now somewhat destabilised with respect to the homogeneous lattice .",
    "this is only to be expected because the hard core repulsion that prevents particle overlaps now makes pleated states with no bond stretching impossible .",
    "this is clear from plots of configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig11]*b * where particles are seen to come close to one another without overlaps . in general , then , the position of the equilibrium transition is shifted to higher values of @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the saddle point @xmath214 is virtually unchanged . as a consequence ,",
    "the location of the dynamical transition does not shift too much so that the equilibrium and dynamical transition points are now closer to each other .",
    "the qualitative nature of the dynamics is similar and the dynamical transition for the same system size occurs again for slightly larger values of @xmath215 . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plot the overlap function @xmath202 for this system at a value of @xmath1 after the transition .",
    "similar ageing dynamics as seen in the network with point vertices is obtained .",
    "in this paper we study a crystalline network consisting of a lattice of particles ( with and without hard core repulsion ) permanently connected to their nearest neighbours by harmonic springs .",
    "we show that this undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous to a pleated phase _ provided that non - affine displacements are artificially enhanced using an external field_. it is interesting to note that the pleating transition in the network , where a homogeneous phase with a uniform stress distribution gives rise to an inhomogeneous phase consisting of an ordered arrangement of pleats where stress is concentrated , has an analogy in the physics of type ii superconductors  @xcite . here",
    "stress plays the rle of the magnetic field and the elimination of stress from the un - pleated parts of the network is a manifestation of a `` stress meissner effect '' .",
    "the possibility of such an effect had been described in the past for crystals which have irregular modulations  @xcite . in these crystals , the order parameter is modulated with a space dependent amplitude and phase producing a _ disordered _ structure .",
    "the non - affine modes discussed in section  [ sec2]a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) do produce a similar modulation .",
    "however , remarkably , the product state is _ ordered _ , contrary to the predictions of ref .",
    "strong correlation effects between the order parameter modulations  @xcite may be responsible for this departure .",
    "nevertheless , this ordered pleated state should be viewed as a classical version of the abrikosov vortex lattice .",
    "the arrangement of pleats now performs the same function as the vortices .",
    "there are several ways in which the calculations described here may be extended .",
    "firstly , we believe that external stress would have significant effects on the transition observed ere . specifically , compressive stress , should decrease the value of @xmath174 , perhaps even to @xmath216 , where the equilibrium transition occurs before the network becomes locally unstable  @xcite .",
    "a similar decrease of @xmath217 is possible for uniaxial or shear stresses .",
    "such stresses should also introduce anisotropy making it possible to design specific pleating morphologies .",
    "pleating of networks may also have some implications for plastic deformation in these systems .",
    "preliminary investigations by us do point to such a possibility and these results will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have confined ourselves , in this paper , to 2d models where experiments can be performed to check all our predictions with available technology  @xcite . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a feedback - loop may be set up where local particle configurations in a colloidal crystal may be used to compute non - affine forces which are then administered using laser traps positioned on - the - fly  @xcite .",
    "we expect such experiments to yield metastable structures .",
    "the enumeration of equilibrium pleated configurations together with their relative free energies and individual barriers and transition states as obtained using techniques elaborated in this paper would , we believe , be useful to analyse the results of these future experiments .    in principle all our calculations can also be extended in a straightforward fashion to higher dimensions as pointed out in  @xcite , though experiments on colloids then become more difficult .",
    "irrespective of this , the analogs of the pleated phase in higher dimensions should certainly be interesting .",
