    "a problem which has long been of interest is determining the possible number of @xmath3-dimensional faces of a polytope , given the number of vertices ; see , for instance , @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "most of this paper is concerned with the case @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , we consider the set @xmath9 there is a @xmath0-polytope with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath10 edges@xmath11 and define , following grnbaum s notation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 184 ) , @xmath12 our main result is to prove grnbaum s conjecture @xcite that @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "grnbaum proved this for @xmath15 .",
    "we also prove that @xmath16 for every @xmath17 .",
    "this was well known in the cases @xmath18 or 3 , and grnbaum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 193 ) noted that @xmath19 . in all cases , we also characterize , up to combinatorial equivalence , the polytopes with minimal number of edges .    in fact , the function @xmath20 was called @xmath21 in @xcite ; for simplicity we will ( except in the final section ) continue to drop the subscript @xmath22 .",
    "grnbaum actually defined a function @xmath23 for each @xmath24 , and conjectured that this is equal to the minimum of @xmath25 @xmath26 is a @xmath0-polytope with @xmath1 vertices@xmath11 if @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 denotes as usual the number of @xmath3-dimensional faces of @xmath26 .",
    "we will say more about higher dimensional faces in the last section .",
    "it is convenient to note that @xmath29    precise upper bounds for the numbers of edges are easy to obtain . a well known result of steinitz ( * ?",
    "10.3 ) asserts that @xmath30 , and the existence of cyclic polytopes shows that @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "since cyclic polytopes are simplicial , the upper bound question for general polytopes has the same solution as the upper bound question for simplicial polytopes .",
    "so we concentrate on lower bounds , which hitherto have been elusive to obtain .",
    "barnette @xcite proved that any simplicial polytope with @xmath1 vertices has at least @xmath33 edges , and there exist simplicial polytopes , namely the stacked polytopes , with precisely this many edges .",
    "kalai s rigidity theorem @xcite asserts that this is still true under the weaker assumption that every 2-face is a triangle .",
    "however little seems to be known for general polytopes .",
    "this first section justifies our focus on low values of @xmath1 .",
    "however it can be skipped , as the rest of the paper does not essentially depend on it .",
    "naturally every vertex in a @xmath0-polytope has degree at least @xmath0 ; a vertex with degree exactly @xmath0 is called _",
    "simple_. a polytope is _ simple _ if every vertex is simple , which is equivalent to saying that @xmath34 . in particular , there is a simple @xmath0-polytope with @xmath1 vertices if and only if @xmath35 .    the following result means the problem of calculating @xmath36 is more interesting for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is not new , and our estimate for @xmath37 is not the best possible , but our argument is completely elementary .    for each @xmath0 , there is an integer @xmath37 such that , for all @xmath38 , if either @xmath1 or @xmath0 is even , then @xmath35 .",
    "first note that for a fixed integer @xmath39 , @xmath40 contains the interval @xmath41 .",
    "a special case of this is that @xmath42 contains the interval @xmath43 . multiplying everything by 2",
    "we conclude that @xmath44 contains every even number from @xmath45 to infinity .",
    "now cutting a vertex from a simple polytope gives us another simple polytope with @xmath46 more vertices ; while cutting an edge from a simple polytope gives us another simple polytope with @xmath47 more vertices .",
    "if @xmath0 is even , it follows that for every odd @xmath48 and for every even @xmath49 there exists a simple @xmath0-polytope with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "whereas if @xmath0 is odd , we see that for every even @xmath50 there exists a simple @xmath0-polytope with @xmath1 vertices .    for the case when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both odd , we can prove that @xmath51 for all sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of this lies somewhat deeper , and details will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this proof gives an asymptotic value for @xmath52 of about @xmath53 .",
    "the original proof of lee ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.4.15 ) gave a weaker estimate , about @xmath54 , more precisely a polynomial with leading term @xmath55 .",
    "( the lower order terms were different , depending on the parity of @xmath0 , but their coefficients were all positive . )",
    "this was improved by bjrner and linusson @xcite , motivated by work of prabhu @xcite , to @xmath56 when @xmath0 is even and @xmath57 when @xmath0 is odd .",
    "the proofs of lee and of bjrner & linusson both depended on the @xmath58-theorem @xcite .",
    "prabhu s did not , but it is still less elementary than ours .",
    "it is often easier to work with the _ excess degree _ of a polytope , which we define as    @xmath60 obviously a polytope is simple iff its excess degree is 0 iff @xmath35 .",
    "note that for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the possible values of the excess are either all even or all odd .    throughout , the word prism will always mean a prism whose base is a simplex .",
    "such a prism is also called a _",
    "simplicial prism_.    let us define a",
    " triplex \" as any multifold pyramid over a prism based on a simplex .",
    "note that this is the same as the free join of a prism and a simplex , and so it is the convex hull of three faces , each a simplex .",
    "clearly a @xmath0-dimensional triplex has at most @xmath59 vertices .    to be more precise ,",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath61 for any @xmath62-fold pyramid over a @xmath39-dimensional simplicial prism , @xmath63 .",
    "any triplex is of this form for some values of @xmath0 and @xmath39 .",
    "clearly @xmath64 is a simplex , and @xmath65 is a prism .",
    "each simplex , and each triplex @xmath66 , is a multiplex as defined by bisztriczky @xcite , but other triplices are not .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath67 , @xmath61 has three types of facet :    @xmath68 facets of the form @xmath69 ( by definition ) ,    @xmath39 facets of the form @xmath70 ( with 2 vertices outside ) ,    and 2 facets of the form @xmath64 ( both simplices ) .    for @xmath71 ,",
    "the latter two forms coincide . if @xmath72 , then @xmath61 has @xmath73 facets altogether .",
    "more generally , let us note here that if @xmath74 is a triplex with @xmath75 vertices , then @xmath76    in general , if @xmath26 is a pyramid with base @xmath77 , then @xmath78 , so this calculation is quite routine .",
    "we will show in this section that @xmath61 is ( up to combinatorial equivalence ) the unique polytope which minimises the number of edges of a @xmath0-polytope with @xmath75 vertices ( for @xmath63 ) .",
    "we will show in the last section that @xmath61 is also the unique polytope which minimises the number of @xmath3-faces of a @xmath0-polytope with @xmath75 vertices , at least for @xmath79 .",
    "[ fig : multiplexes ]    the following identity is useful for us to know .",

    "a polytope is said to be _",
    "decomposable _ if it can be expressed as the minkowski sum of two dis - similar two polytopes ; this concept also makes sense for general convex bodies .",
    "( recall that the minkowski sum @xmath87 of two convex bodies @xmath88 and @xmath89 is simply @xmath90 ; and that two polytopes are _ similar _ if one can be obtained from the other by a dilation and a translation . )",

    "if both such facets have @xmath73 vertices , hence excess degree at least @xmath259 ( as they are not triplices ) , the total excess degree will be at least @xmath351 .    otherwise , one such facet @xmath77 has @xmath73 vertices , and hence excess degree at least @xmath259 , while the other facet @xmath115 has @xmath184 vertices and hence is a pyramid over @xmath112 .",
    "every vertex in @xmath115 has degree at least @xmath0 in @xmath352 , and the one vertex outside must be adjacent to at least @xmath7 of them .",

    "every 2-face of @xmath26 is a triangle in this case , so the excess degree is at least that guaranteed for simplicial polytopes by the lower bound theorem i.e. @xmath354 .",

    "we will first show that grnbaum s conjecture is correct for polytopes with @xmath73 facets and no more than @xmath59 vertices , for any value of @xmath3 .    using this",

    "we also establish some results concerning high dimensional faces when @xmath6 .    to continue",
    ", it will be necessary to understand the structure of @xmath0-polytopes with @xmath73 facets .",
    "the structure of @xmath0-polytopes with @xmath73 vertices is quite well known , @xcite or @xcite , and dualising leads to the following result , which classifies the polytopes with @xmath73 facets .",
    "it appears explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath265-vector is the dual statement to @xcite .",
    "[ dplus2facets ] any @xmath0-dimensional polytope with @xmath73 facets is , for some @xmath381 and @xmath382 with @xmath383 , a @xmath382-fold pyramid over @xmath384 .",
    "it has @xmath385 vertices , and the number of its @xmath3-dimensional faces is @xmath386    since @xmath387 , and @xmath388 if @xmath389 , it is clear that , amongst all @xmath0-polytopes with @xmath75 vertices , the triplex minimises the number of facets . in general",
    "it is not the unique minimiser .",
    "but sometimes it is ; it depends on the value of @xmath39 .",
    "the next result reformulates the special case of a result of mcmullen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) , in which only polytopes with no more than @xmath59 vertices are considered .              for ( iii )",

    "our hypothesis tells us that @xmath393 and @xmath383 ; this forces @xmath394 .",
    "so if @xmath317 is prime or 1 , then @xmath395 , @xmath396 and the polytope is @xmath61 . on the other hand , if @xmath397 where @xmath398 , then @xmath399 , and so @xmath400 is non - negative and we have a second solution for @xmath401 .              using the identity above several times , we have @xmath408 as required .",
    "note that the last inequality is strict if @xmath409 , and the previous inequality is strict otherwise . adding @xmath410 to both sides and rearranging , we obtain @xmath411                        fix @xmath431 with @xmath130 and @xmath5 ( or @xmath432 and @xmath420 ) , and let @xmath26 be a @xmath0-polytope with @xmath75 vertices .",

    "it follows that @xmath451    thus the first cases for which grnbaum s conjecture remain open are @xmath452 , @xmath442 , @xmath453 or 12 .",
    "this proof actually shows that there are gaps in the number of @xmath3-faces for values of @xmath3 other than 1 , something which has not been previously observed .",
    "for example , in dimension 5 , the triplex @xmath454 has 20 ridges , but every other 5-polytope with 8 vertices has at least 22 ridges .",
