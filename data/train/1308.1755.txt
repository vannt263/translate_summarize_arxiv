    ", we use the observed @xmath10 of the soft diffuse because that of cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 may have additional absorption by the foreground molecular clouds .",
    "the best - fit value of 3.5@xmath11 @xmath12 is 58% of the total column density along the line - of - sight to g348.5@xmath00.1 .",
    "if the line - of - sight length of the @xmath52 and @xmath44 estimation in the radio band is assumed to be 17 kpc , double the distance from the sun to the galactic center , the distance of g348.5@xmath00.1 is estimated to be 9.9@xmath172.6 kpc .",
    "this value is consistent with those of the previous estimation @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt the distance to be 10 kpc in the following discussion .",
    "the size of the soft diffuse plasma is @xmath53 ( @xmath223.3 pc@xmath717.5 pc at 10kpc ) . dividing a radius of the major axis ( 4@xmath3@xmath211.6 pc ) by a sound velocity at a temperature of 0.49 kev",
    ", we can estimate a dynamical age of the snr to be 2.4@xmath710@xmath54 year .",
    "assuming that the line - of - sight length of the plasma is equal to the minor axis ( the plasma shape is assumed to be an ellipsoid ) , the volume is estimated to be 1.1@xmath710@xmath55 @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a filling factor . adopting the best - fit volume emission measure of 8.9@xmath710@xmath58 @xmath27 and @xmath39=1.2@xmath59 , where @xmath39 and @xmath59 are the electron and hydrogen density , respectively",
    ", the mean hydrogen density is derived to be @xmath59=0.82@xmath60 @xmath27 .",
    "then the recombination time ( @xmath61/@xmath39 ) is calculated to be 4.2@xmath710@xmath54@xmath62 years , nearly the same as the dynamical age , we thus propose that the plasma was full ionized at high temperature ( @xmath631.6 kev ) in the early phase of 4.2@xmath710@xmath54@xmath62 years ago , and then the plasma changed to a recombining phase due to selective cooling of electrons to a lower temperature of @xmath20.5 kev .",
    "the rrc in the soft diffuse is weaker than those of the other rp - detected snrs ; the recombining timescale of the soft diffuse is 1.3@xmath64 @xmath27 s , while those of the other rp snrs are ( 0.10.7)@xmath26 @xmath27 s ( @xcite ; s. minami , private communication ) .",
    "thus , the plasma in the soft diffuse of g348.5@xmath00.1 would be the oldest among the rp snrs .",
    "the spectrum of cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 is well explained by a simple pl model with a photon index of 1.94@xmath14 and a column density of @xmath65 @xmath12 .",
    "these values are consistent with those with chandra and xmm - newton within the errors @xcite , but our values are more accurate with smaller errors .    the density of the northern cloud in the line - of - sight to cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 was reported to be @xmath66=660 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath67 @xmath12 , assuming the uniform density along the line - of - sight length of 10 pc ( roughly equal to the width of the northern cloud ) .",
    "since the best - fit @xmath10 value of cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 is larger than that of the soft diffuse by @xmath10=4@xmath11 @xmath12 , it is likely that cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 is at the same distance of the soft diffuse ( 10 kpc ) , and hence we infer that these two sources are physically associated with snr g348.5@xmath00.1 . the unabsorbed x - ray flux of cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 in the 0.510 kev band is calculated to be @xmath68 erg s@xmath47 @xmath12 which roughly agrees with the chandra / xmm - newton results .",
    "@xcite argued that cxou j171419.8@xmath1383023 is a candidate for a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , although their best - fit photon index is smaller than those of typical pwne .",
