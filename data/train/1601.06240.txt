    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semidetached binary systems consisting of a red star filling its corresponding roche lobe and losing matter to a white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "cvs with periods over 10 hr are rare , which is a natural consequence of the requirement for a ( nearly ) main sequence donor star to match its roche lobe size @xcite .",
    "cvs with longer periods should contain late - type stars that have departed the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) in order to comply with the latter condition .",
    "relevant to this study is a small group of objects that were thought to be low - accretion - rate polars , that is , magnetic cvs with an accretion rate of @xmath1yr@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been argued that these are in fact a detached pair of white and red dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "a model was proposed according to which the magnetic white dwarf accretes matter captured from the wind of a magnetically active m dwarf .",
    "hence they were dubbed prepolars containing m - dwarf companions , which failed to achieve roche lobe contact in their post - common - envelope evolution .",
    "the theoretical basis for a model in which the accretion is fueled by a stellar wind from the m dwarf and collected through interlocked magnetic fields of binary components was proposed earlier by @xcite .    here",

    "were made with the external task _ lacos _ @xcite .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made with the help of an arc lamp taken every 10th exposure .",
    "the boller & chivens spectrograph , made originally for photographic plates , was later adopted for the ccd camera , a much heavier detector .",
    "that introduces strong flexes and significant shifts in the wavelength s zero point , which we usually correct by using a strong sky line in each spectrum . at moderate zenith heights ,",
    "those shifts can reach @xmath4 , and the transition from exposure to exposure is smooth , so a reasonable correction is attainable .",
    "but because v1082sgr  is a southern object , it remains quite low in spm ( altitude @xmath5 ) , even when the object passes through the meridian . as a result , we had severe problems with wavelength calibration , and a fraction of our spectra were worthless for radial velocity ( rv ) studies .",
    "the spectra of the object were flux calibrated using spectrophotometric standard stars observed during the same night . the instrument can not automatically rotate the slit to the corresponding parallactic angle , and for simplicity we routinely used an e  w slit orientation . in a majority of observations the slit width was kept narrow ( @xmath6 m = 2 arcsec ) for better resolution .",
    "these two factors make a correct flux calibration difficult . but in 2014 s observational run we acquired a couple of low and another few of higher ( 300 and 1200 grooves mm@xmath2 ) resolution spectra , fwhm=8.5 and 2.2  , with a wide @xmath7 m slit to circumvent this flux calibration problem .",

    "a variety of standards from k2 to k4 were used , with no significant differences in the obtained velocities .",

    "the maximum to minimum cycles occur approximately every 29 days .",
    "we tentatively modeled the light curve with a sinusoid .",
    "only six cycles were covered during our observations .",
    "the spectral properties of v1082sgr  change strongly with the luminosity .",
    "two distinctive states can be singled out . in the high state",
    "it has intense emission lines , most notably of the balmer series accompanied by neutral and ionized helium .",
    "the balmer decrement is rather steep ( h@xmath9/h@xmath10/h@xmath11/h@xmath12/h@xmath13=1.3/1.0/0.85/0.65/0.54 ) .",
    "heii is ever present in the spectra when it is in the high state , and its intensity is comparable to that of h@xmath10 . in addition , a blend of fluorescent lines of n iii and c iii around @xmath14  is prominently present .",
    "also clearly visible are absorption lines belonging to the secondary star . in figure[fig : spec ] example spectra of the object in the high , the intermediate , and the low states are presented . as the object becomes fainter , the lines also weaken .",
    "however , the low - state spectrum is highly unusual for a cv because it contains pure radiation from the secondary star .",
    "spectra resembling an isolated k star with practically no emission lines have been observed in this system on many occasions in different epochs . in total",
    "we have 10 occurrences of a low state in the jt spectra and one of our own ( as a criteria being considered , the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath9 being less than 4.0 ) .",
    "we witnessed the emergence of emission lines of h@xmath10 and heii from one night to another , with no significant change in the continuum levels .",
    "@xcite report that v1082sgr  is also a highly variable source also in the uv and x - rays .",
    "the uv measurements are presented in figure[fig : xuv ] .",
    "the data were taken in four different filters , unfortunately .",
    "that does not help in interpreting the uv light curve or in determining times when the object was in a low state , i.e. when there was no active accretion going on . however , there are recurring observations obtained in the same uvm2 and uvw2 _ swift _ uvot filters .",
    "a comparison among them and an analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( presented below in section[sec : sed ] ) show that the object probably was in a truly low state only during the 2012 observations corresponding to hjd2456099 - 6100 . during that period of time ,",
    "two exposures ( 3400 and 6000s long ) were obtained over two consecutive days , and the source was persistently faint in the uv and was barely visible in the x - ray .",
    "the count rate was @xmath15 .    since we know",
    "that in the low state the donor star dominates the flux in the optical domain and there is little evidence of ongoing accretion , we might expect that the x - ray flux is formed by the k - type star .",
    "@xcite estimated that v1082sgr  in the low state has a flux of @xmath16   corresponding to luminosity @xmath17 for a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit of the soft ( 0.1 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray luminosities of rs cvn systems , which are generally found in the range of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the average x - ray spectrum of the object in a broad 0.3100kev range is 100 times brighter , reflecting the high state .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a small x - ray - emitting region having plasma temperatures typical of a magnetically confined accretion flow , like in polars .",
    "the @xmath19   mass of the white dwarf was fetched from the fit to the composite _ xmm - newton _ epic and _ swift _ bat spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reported a prominent brightening , dubbed as a `` flare '' .",
    "that 56 hour flare - like brightening in the x - ray light curve can be interpreted as part of an irregular variability , but it also can be the result of a magnetic pole transiting the line of sight .",
    "the entire span of time during which _ suzaku _ took exposures of v1082sgr  was slightly longer than 30 hr , longer than the orbital period of the object , but not enough to cover two cycles .",
    "if we assume it was not a flare but orbital modulation , then we can fold it with the @xmath20 and compare it to v479and , a very similar object contemplated in this paper .",
    "the x - ray light curves of both objects are presented in figure[fig : xlc ] , each folded with their corresponding orbital period and ephemeris .",
    "the interesting thing about this plot is that v479and was observed for two continuous orbital cycles , and we know for sure that the brightening there is due to the orbital modulation . in both cases ,",
    "the x - ray - emitting region is located on the side of the white dwarf facing the donor star and hence comes into the sight of view right after the phase zero .",
    "the duration of brightening is similar , and so is the relative flux , although v479and is much fainter .",
    "below we discuss in more detail the similarities of these two objects and their common identity .",
    "v1082sgr  experiences low states and , as was mentioned earlier , the spectrum of the object features only the late - type companion of the binary during these episodes .",
    "we only had one chance to observe v1082sgr  spectroscopically in a low state ( jd=2456893 ) .",
    "we used a low - resolution setting and a wide slit , hence we covered a wide wavelength range with reliable flux calibration . on the next night , the object already featured emission lines , so it probably was on the path of brightening .",
    "the low - state spectrum is presented in figures[fig : spec ] and [ fig : abslines ] .",
    "jt has obtained 14 low - state spectra taken at different epochs .",
    "it is not excluded that the flux calibration of their spectra is not very precise ( it is certainly off at the blue end of the spectrum ) and the flux is underestimated .",
    "our spectrum and the average of jt spectra , scaled to the level of spm , are displayed in the left panels of figure[fig : abslines ] , where large portions of spectra are plotted in three vertical panels covering the entire observed range .",
    "@xcite suggested a k4 spectral type classification for the donor star of v1082sgr , but they also mentioned a large uncertainty of the estimate .",
    "there are many spectra of zams k stars available in catalogs , and one can find a satisfactory continuum flux fit among k2k4v stars , but they fail to match all absorption features .",
    "particularly , the trough corresponding to the mgh band blueward from the mg@xmath21   triplet is poorly fit , and the mgh feature around @xmath22   is not compatible with the main - sequence luminosity class .",
    "we think the k2iv spectrum represents a better match to the observed spectra .",
    "two selected k2iv stars ( bsns104 and hd197964 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) scaled to the spm spectrum are overplotted .",
    "they were observed on the same night with the same instrumental settings .",
    "bsns104 represents a perfect match , while hd197964 deviates at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , hd197964 tallies better with the object than bsns104 in the higher - resolution spectra regarding the depth of absorption features .",
    "the higher - resolution spectra obtained on the next night are presented in the right side panels .",
    "emission lines have already reappeared in v1082sgr , but the continuum and absorption lines were not affected yet .",
    "the spectra in these panels are normalized .",
    "there is a close resemblance of the spectra of the object obtained at spm , by jt and hd197964 .",
    "of course , spectral classification of the donor star should be done with caution , since it may have large spots and , depending on which part of the star surface was observed , the spectral class can vary by two digits .",

    "the data are folded with the orbital period and repeated twice for illustrative purposes.,width=302 ]    the orbital period of v1082sgr   was determined by jt using a complex of absorption features .",
    "we repeated the analysis by adding some reliable rv measurements obtained by us ( adding a longer time base ) and found no deviation from the period determined by jt .",
    "we present the absorption lines rv curve in the bottom panel of figure[fig : rv ] only for comparison with the corresponding heii and h@xmath10   rv curves .",
    "the emission lines of v1082sgr   in a high state are very intense .",
    "their intensity is strongly variable , but they remain relatively narrow ( fwhm @xmath23 ; fwzi @xmath24  of h@xmath10 ) ( see figure[fig : spec ] ) . in the high state ,",
    "the ews of h@xmath9  are in a @xmath25 to @xmath26   range . in figure[fig : eprofiles ] the profiles of h@xmath9 and heii are presented . also included in the plot is a prominent blend of niii and ciii around @xmath14 .",
    "it is formed by a continuum fluorescence , as argued by @xcite and is evidence of a strong uv continuum .",
    "the quick resurgence of intense emission lines with little change of continuum and the balmer decrement asserts that the emission lines are formed in optically thin , sparse gas .",
    "the deficiency of the g - band and niii / ciii profile is probably evidence of a peculiar chemical composition of the donor star .",
    "the emission line profiles are single peaked and symmetric .",
    "it would be almost impossible to determine the orbital period by them .",
    "however , when folded with known orbital periods , they start to make sense .",
    "a periodic pattern is clearly present , and it is in a strict counter - phase from the absorption lines , as demonstrated in figure[fig : rv ] .",
    "the measurements of the rvs of h@xmath10  and heii are notably dispersed relative to the best - fit sine curves .",
    "the reason is not the accuracy of the measurements , but the intrinsic , chaotic velocities of the gas superposed on orbital motion .",
    "nevertheless , both sine curves show a strong anticorrelation with the absorption lines formed at the donor star , with the semiamplitude of h@xmath10 being 30% less than that of heii .",

    "the ew in the low state reaches @xmath28 , a value very common for chromospherically active k stars @xcite .",
    "the rvs of h@xmath9 line with ew@xmath29  tend to follow the motion corresponding to the secondary .",
    "this is not surprising , assuming that it has a chromospheric origin .",
    "the rvs of the h@xmath9 line in low - state spectra are marked by filled pentagons in the bottom panel of figure[fig : rv ] . in figure[fig:2ndry ] the residual spectra after subtraction of a k2iv from the low - state spectrum is presented .",
    "the red dashed line corresponds to a zero flux .",
    "caii h&k lines become visible in the residual spectrum along with a narrow h@xmath9 and are clearly of a chromospheric nature .",
    "the presence of a faint h@xmath10   line is evidence of enhanced activity .",
    "the roche lobe size of a k2 star at a 20hr orbital period is @xmath30r/@xmath31 for a range of white dwarf masses from 0.5 to 1.2 .",
    "meanwhile , a k2v star has a radius @xmath32 , and if the donor star is still on zams , it would hardly fill even half of its corresponding roche lobe .",
    "it will take 20 - 40 gyr for a k star to evolve to the size of the roche lobe .",
    "the shortest distance to v1082sgr  would be 550pc if the donor is a zams star and 1400pc if it is close to filling its roche lobe , assuming that the average visual magnitude ( @xmath33 ) at the low state emanates entirely from the donor .    in figure[fig :",
    "sed ] the sed of the object ( black lines and symbols ) is presented from the ir to uv .",
    "the spectra , as well as photometric measurements , are corrected for the interstellar reddening by assuming @xmath34 and a standard @xmath35 @xcite and are recalculated for other wavelengths using the @xcite parametrization .",
    "worth noting is that the hydrogen column density @xmath36 used in the x - ray spectral analysis corresponds to the same extinction .",
    "it is not clear in which luminosity state of the object some photometric data were obtained .",
    "the photometric uv data are apparently available in both states .",
    "particularly , _ swift _ uvot uvm2 band measurements are stretched over a wide energy range ; part of them around hjd2456717 ( see figure[fig : xuv ] ) are certainly taken during the low state , i.e. a period of time when the contribution from the accretion - fueled processes is negligible . during such periods , we observe a pure spectrum of the late star in the optical domain .",
    "it would be natural to assume that the uv flux at such moments is dominated by the white dwarf .",
    "the temperature of the white dwarf could not be constrained from the available data .",
    "however , we can make a rough estimate from the energy balance .",
    "a white dwarf should have a radius of @xmath37 if the cool star is close to the main sequence , and two times smaller if it is about roche lobe size .",
    "accordingly , it must have a temperature ranging from @xmath38 to 30000k to provide sufficient luminosity and be observable at the low state .",
    "presented in figure[fig : sed ] are blackbodies of 17 and 30 kk effective temperature ( long - dashed lines ) , describing a possible contribution from the white dwarf .",
    "the red short - dashed line is a black - body of 4800k representing the cool star .",
    "a realistic combination of values for the white dwarf radius and the temperature stemming from @xmath39 relation , where @xmath40 is distance to the object , confirms correctness of our assumption that in the low state we observe purely stellar components .",
    "the light - green , short - dashed line roughly corresponds to the flux difference between the high and low states .",
    "dash - dotted lines are power - law @xmath41 with @xmath42 and 2.33 .",
    "most cvs radiate in the uv in the form of a power law with indexes found within that range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible to find a family of observed points laying on a single power law , except for the u - band data , which might be elevated by the balmer jump . nevertheless , some measurements are clearly off from being part of a straight line .",
    "the additional emission appearing during high states in the uv does not fit easily into a black body or a power - law model .",
    "this is not substantial evidence , but it is a complementary argument to the ones made in section[sec : emlines ] that an accretion disk or a stream , common in cvs , is not the source of the excess radiation",
    ".    an alternative can be the cyclotron radiation since in the case of low - rate magnetic accretion it provides the dominant cooling mechanism .",
    "such radiation is clearly observed in prepolars containing m dwarfs as a donor star .",
    "of course , in polars and prepolars with shorter periods ( @xmath438hr ) , the cyclotron radiation is also observed in the optical domain .",
    "however , we could not find any credible signs of cyclotron lines ( wide humps in the continuum ) in the optical spectra of v1082sgr  in the high state .",
    "but it is natural because in the optical range the donor star of v1082sgr   is at least @xmath44 times brighter than a m4v contained in prepolars .",
    "we have demonstrated above that v1082sgr  in the high state has the spectral appearance of a cv , but there are number of irreconcilable details that invalidate such an interpretation .",
    "one of the basic properties of cvs is the condition that the donor star fills its roche lobe ( roche lobe overflow or rlof ) and the system is semidetached .",
    "this leads to the mass loss through the lagrangian @xmath45 point and formation of a mass - transfer ballistic stream , which upon arrival to the vicinity of the white dwarf either forms an accretion disk or becomes coupled with the magnetosphere of the magnetic white dwarf and is channeled to the magnetic pole of the latter .",
    "it is believed that in systems with orbital periods longer than three hours the angular momentum and subsequently the mass loss are driven by magnetic breaking .",
    "although the mass transfer rate can fluctuate , and possibly is the cause of certain types of variability in the rich diversity of cvs , there are no mechanisms to suddenly halt the mass transfer while the system complies with rlof and magnetic breaking conditions .",
    "it is even more difficult is to imagine a mass transfer / accretion ceasing and restoring on a semiregular basis . in v1082sgr",
    "we observe such episodes when the accretion - released radiation vanishes repeatedly .    at the same time",
    ", a simple calculation shows that the roche lobe size in a binary with 15 - 20 hr period is at least two times larger than the radius of an early - k main - sequence star , regardless of white dwarf mass .",
    "rough estimates show that it will take at least 18 gyr for a k0 companion to reach the size of the roche lobe by accounting for magnetic breaking and gravitational waves for angular momentum loss ( o. toloza 2015 , private communication ) .",
    "if we had only v1082sgr  on our hands , maybe we could consider it as a unique case , but the existence of almost identical v479 and makes this assumption improbable .",
    "however , if we assume that the donor stars in v1082sgr  and v479 and are rlof ( with all arguments against ) and these two objects are ordinary cvs , we should surmise standard accretion schemes , proper to cvs .",
    "there are strong arguments against the accretion via disk .",
    "a powerful x - ray emission clearly modulated with orbital period in the case of v479 and and similar variability in v1082sgr  and intense heii are not common features of disk systems .",
    "if emission lines are formed in an accretion disk , then both these objects must be of extremely low inclination angle and should harbor unusually massive white dwarfs , another improbable assumption discrediting the accretion disk scenario .",
    "it is more natural to assume that the white dwarfs in these two objects are magnetic based on the observed x - ray features . in magnetic cvs or polars ,",
    "the emission lines in the absence of a disk are formed in accretion streams and are occasionally on the irradiated side of the donor star .",
    "such emission lines should have very high radial velocities dephased from stellar components or be in phase with the donor - star rvs @xcite .",
    "we do not observe either .",
    "often , emission lines in polars come from two to three different components ; then the observed profiles of the lines are very complex , with several s waves forming beautiful patterns in the traced spectra .",
    "this is not the case with either object discussed here .",
    "so it is safe to say that in these two objects the donor stars most probably do not fill their corresponding roche lobes , even if they are slightly evolved , and that the accretion flows do not follow familiar paths , and hence they are not qualified to be classified as cvs .",
    "what are the alternatives ?",
    "we think that an analogy with shorter - orbital - period prepolars containing m - type companions helps to address all of the issues left unanswered by a cv model .",
    "prepolars are considered detached binaries containing a magnetic white dwarf accreting at a low rate ( @xmath46  yr@xmath2 ) from the stellar wind of an m dwarf @xcite .",
    "soon after their discovery by they were dubbed low - accretion - rate polars , which clearly recognizes the accretion - rate deficiency and , as a consequence , the cooling taking place exclusively via cyclotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the donor stars in low - rate polars are clearly visible and are identified as m stars . thereafter , it was realized that , at the observed periods , late - m star companions do not fill their corresponding roche lobes .",
    "so prepolars are rather detached systems , in which the entire stellar wind of the donor star is captured by the coupled magnetic field and `` siphoned '' onto the white dwarf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    however , the analogy is not straightforward because v1082sgr   and v479and show intense emission lines most of the time , which are permanently absent in prepolars with late - m donor stars .",
    "the objects discussed here have strong x - ray emission , which is not observed in their short - period counterparts . v1082sgr   and v479and do not exhibit cyclotron lines in the optical spectra , for which the prepolars became renowned .",
    "most of the differences in appearance are easily explained :    a.   long - period systems containing slightly evolved k stars lose significantly more mass by stellar wind than do m dwarfs . @xcite",
    "have argued that the wind mass loss from rapidly rotating , active k stars can be about @xmath47 times higher than in their older , slow - rotating counterparts .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath48yr@xmath2   for a few k1iv stars . b.   therefore , binaries with early - k donors may have accretion rates by an order higher than known prepolars .",
    "as it has been demonstrated by @xcite a sufficiently high magnetic field would siphon the entire stellar wind from the secondary .",
    "recently , @xcite described it as a `` magnetic bottle '' which we find is an appropriate term to present this phenomenon . c.   a higher accretion rate will require bremsstrahlung to provide sufficient radiative cooling , while making cyclotron emission less prominent @xcite .",
    "d.   a collimated x - ray beam from the magnetic pole will create pulses , one per orbital period ( observed in v479and ) , and will ionize the gas gathered between stars , giving rise to the emission spectrum .",
    "e.   meanwhile , the bright donor star would conceal the cyclotron spectrum in the optical range .",
    "f.   emission lines would have low rvs with velocities segregated according to the distance to the source of ionization and single - peaked profiles .",
    "the final segment of accretion flow will add a broad base to the emission lines , much like the one observed in regular polars @xcite .",
    "there is another important difference between short- and long - period prepolars . in the former",
    ", m dwarfs would not evolve far from the zams in a hubble time , while late - g k stars have a chance to depart .",
    "if , after the first common envelope phase , the separation of the binary reaches a point when the secondary star fills its roche lobe , its evolution would be altered . in , the authors assumed that the donor star fills its roche lobe and calculated possible , but highly improbable , track of the binary in the @xmath20 vs. spectral type of the donor diagram .",
    "identification of a second system with very similar characteristics , which in addition is often found in an accretion shutoff state , invalidates that assumption .",
    "if the donor star is smaller than the roche lobe , it should proceed to evolve as an isolated star .",
    "it is difficult to assess the fraction of roche lobe volume that donor stars in v1082sgr  and v479and occupy at the moment .",
    "there are indications that they might be slightly evolved , but evidence also lacking that they are in rlof state .",
    "since the dynamical estimate of high white dwarf mass in both these systems is not credible , it is fair to assume that they could be close to an average white dwarf mass , or less than one solar mass .",
    "hence , their mass ratio @xmath49 , which places them in a zone of instability in the thermal timescale of mass transfer @xcite , if the condition of rlof was to be true .",
    "if the assumption is correct that these two objects are detached binaries with a strongly magnetic white dwarf companion , then we may conclude that they imitate the cv appearance but they are not cvs .",
    "hence , they elude lists of detached wd@xmath0k - star systems , introducing a bias in the statistics @xcite .",
    "so far , attempts to find detached binaries with magnetic white dwarfs and late - type companions were largely fruitless , with only one firmly identified by @xcite .",
    "the shorter period pre - cvs ( @xmath50hr ) with m - dwarf components have a distinct optical spectra and can be relatively easy to identify .",
    "the longer - period systems have a more massive and bright g / k companion .",
    "they form emission lines in the high mass transfer rate state and become indistinguishable from ordinary cvs , while in the low state they appear as isolated g or k stars .",
    "we presented spectral , photometric multiwavelength observations of a 20.82 hr orbital period binary v1082sgr .",
    "it shows distinct high and low states .",
    "switching from one state to another occurs quite frequently , probably cyclically . in the high state it appears as a cv , which assumes that the object is a semidetached binary with the donor star filling its roche lobe and losing matter to a compact companion .",
    "but , in the low state , no signs of any accretion are observable , unlike other cvs .",
    "the optical spectrum is devoid of emission lines , except for those arising from chromospheric activity , pertaining to a k star .",
    "the minimum x - ray flux is consistent with the coronal emission of rapidly rotating k stars , and the minimum uv flux is consistent with a contribution from a white dwarf .",
    "no additional continuum flux is detected .",
    "it is not clear how the accretion can be frequently halted from a roche - lobe - overfilling donor star that is under the stress of magnetic breaking .",
    "therefore we assumed that v1082sgr  is a detached binary .",
    "this conclusion is congruent with evolutionary considerations .",
    "as it is shown in , a semidetached binary emerging from the common envelope phase , containing a k star and having orbital period similar to v479and , will have a peculiar track and will have a limited life as a cv . on the other hand , it takes several @xmath51 years for an isolated k star to reach the size of the roche lobe in such a binary .",
    "neither is a probable scenario to provide at least two systems with characteristics otherwise unique for cvs",
    ".    flux ratio , profiles , widths , rv amplitudes , orbital phasing , and composition of emission lines argue against presence of an accretion disk or accretion streams like the ones observed in ordinary cvs @xcite or classic polars . in particular ,",
    "an assumption that the emission lines form in the vicinity of the white dwarf leads to the conclusion that both v1082sgr  and v479and , harbor a massive white dwarf and have an extremely low inclination angle of orbital planes .    on the other hand ,",
    "the presence and the characteristics of x - ray and excess uv radiation and the appearance of an intense heii line leaves little prospect but a magnetic accretion on the white dwarf as a source of high - energy radiation .",
    "if the white dwarf has a magnetic field strength corresponding to known high - field polars and the k star is similar to chromospherically active stars , the magnetospheres of stellar components can be coupled .",
    "that will help to synchronize the spin period of the white dwarf with the orbital and will help to collect and siphon stellar wind from the donor star onto the white dwarf .",
    "the essential difference from polars is that the matter is transferred from the donor to the accreting star not through a ballistic trajectory , but instead by flowing through the bottleneck formed by the closed magnetic lines between stars .",
    "such a trajectory explains the amplitude , the ratio of radial velocities , and the composition and profiles of the emission lines .",
    "the cyclical nature of high and low states and the practically total cessation of accretion in the case v1082sgr  might be the result of differential rotation of the k star .",
    "v479and does not show such low states .",
    "a mass transfer induced by the interaction of magnetospheres of detached binaries also helps to explain the lack of magnetic white dwarfs in detached close binaries .",
    "magnetic cvs constitute roughly @xmath52 of the total number of cvs , and @xmath53 of isolated white dwarfs are magnetic @xcite . however , among 2300 detached white@xmath0red dwarf close binaries , none are found to contain a strongly magnetic white dwarf .",
    "@xcite wondered where the progenitors of magnetic cvs and magnetic white dwarfs with detached , nongenerate companions are .",
    "they cite prepolars with m companions as likely candidates .",
    "@xcite agree with this assessment .",
    "the two objects discussed in this paper complement a sample of prepolars with m - dwarf companion .",
    "there is a consensus that discovering such systems is a challenging task . in particular , prepolars with m - companions",
    "have extremely low optical and x - ray luminosities and no strong emission features or outbursts to reveal them in surveys . in the case of magnetic detached binaries with an earlier components , like v1082",
    "sgr and v479 and , the identification is difficult because they are confused for nova - like cvs in a high state and rscvn objects in a low state . in the active accretion mode",
    ", they look like low - inclination cvs , and with periods exceeding a few hours such systems have little chance to be studied in detail .",
    "therefore , their statistically small numbers , compared to magnetic cvs and magnetic isolated white dwarfs , might be simply be a result of observational bias .",
    "the study of these objects lacks a few important components .",
    "first of all , we need to find direct evidence of the magnetic nature of the white dwarfs and preferably measure the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we need better x - ray coverage of their long orbital periods in order to understand accretion process .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy with high resolution of the donor star is very desirable .",
