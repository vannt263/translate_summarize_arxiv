    "soon after the westerbork radio synthesis telescope ( wsrt ) went online , @xcite made the first report of a correlation between 1415  mhz radio and 10  @xmath0 m mid - infrared luminosities for a sample of seyfert galaxy nuclei .",
    "this discovery was soon extended to the nuclei of normal spirals , though the dispersion was found to be smaller in the correlation for the original sample of seyferts ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was not until the coming of iras that the optically thin radio continuum emission from galaxies was found to be better correlated with the far infrared ( fir ) dust emission of galaxies _ without _ an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between radio and infrared emission from galaxies is that they are both powered by massive stars , as pointed out originally for starbursts by @xcite .",
    "young massive stars , which heat up dust to provide the fir emission , are the same stars which end as supernovae ( sne ) and bring about the synchrotron emission observed at radio wavelengths .",
    "if this general picture is correct , the fact that the mean free path of uv photons ( @xmath3100  pc ) which heat the dust is much less than the diffusion length for a cr@xmath2 ( @xmath31 - 2  kpc ) suggests that the radio image should resemble a smeared version of the infrared image .",
    "this idea was first introduced by @xcite , who attempted to model the propagation of cr@xmath2s by smearing iras data of galaxies using parameterized kernels containing the physics of the cr@xmath2 propagation and diffusion , to better match the morphology of the corresponding radio data .    in an attempt to better understand the fir - radio correlation",
    ", we are using mips infrared data from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) legacy science project ( @xcite ) . in this initial study",
    ", we examine the variations of the fir - radio correlation on sub - kpc scales within four of the nearest face - on galaxies in the sings sample : ngc  2403 , ngc  3031 ( m81 ) , ngc  5194 ( m51a ) , and ngc  6946 . using high resolution _ spitzer _ imaging , we are also able to test the smearing model of @xcite with greater accuracy , at higher spatial resolution , and in more galaxies , with the aim of gaining better insight into cr@xmath2 diffusion and confinement within galaxy disks . for a complete discussion ,",
    "we direct the reader to @xcite .",
    "in figure [ qmaps ] we plot @xmath4 }       { f_{\\nu}(22~\\rm{cm})[\\rm{jy}]}\\right)$ ] for each galaxy .",
    "we find that elevated @xmath1 ratios are associated with bright structures in the infrared and radio images of each galaxy .",
    "the most obvious cases are seen for the bright spiral arms of ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 and ngc  6946 .",
    "all three galaxies show enhanced @xmath1 ratios along their arms , with local peaks centered on h ii regions , and depressed ratios located in the quiescent inter - arm and outer - disk regions of each galaxy . for ngc  2403 , which does not have a grand - design spiral morphology",
    ", we still see @xmath1 peaks associated with h ii regions .    to quantify radial variations in @xmath1 , along with any dependencies of @xmath1 on the 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness within each galaxy , we perform aperture photometry using apertures having diameters equal to the fwhm of the mips 70  @xmath0 m psf ( i.e. 17  ) .",
    "the measured dispersion of @xmath1 within each galaxy is less than @xmath30.25  dex .",
    "we find a general trend of increasing @xmath1 ratios with increasing 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness and decreasing radius . the residual dispersion around the trend of @xmath1 with increasing radius is found to be larger than the residual dispersion around the trend of @xmath1 with increasing 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness by @xmath30.1  dex .",
    "this suggests that the star formation sites within the disk are more important in determining the overall appearance of the @xmath1 maps compared to the exponential profiles of the disks themselves .      in figure [ globloc ]",
    "we show our local sub - kpc @xmath1 ratios together with global @xmath1 values for 1752 galaxies from the study of @xcite . using their cataloged 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) and 60 and 100  @xmath0 m iras data , we converted iras based @xmath5 values to _ spitzer _ @xmath1 values using the sed models of @xcite .",
    "we find that the dispersion in the local sub - kpc @xmath1 ratios within our sample galaxies is comparable to that of global ratios . in the @xcite sample , @xmath1 appears to be roughly constant with increasing galaxy luminosity while , within each disk , @xmath1 ratios clearly increase with the 70  @xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "this difference in the observed trend between @xmath1 and luminosity within and among galaxies can be explained by the diffusion of cr@xmath2 within the galaxy disks .",
    "to help understand the underlying physics of the correlation , we look to see whether the image - smearing model works to improve the correlation between the infrared and radio morphologies of galaxies .",
    "determining the functional form of the best fit smearing kernel provides insight into the propagation and diffusion characteristics of cosmic rays within galaxy disks . in this study",
    "we examine the behavior for gaussian and exponential kernels oriented in the planes of the sky and each galaxy disk .",
    "we define the residuals between the smeared 70  @xmath0 m map ( @xmath6:@xmath7shape , @xmath8orientation , and @xmath9=scale - length ) and the observed 22  cm map ( r ) by , @xmath10^{2}}{\\sum r_{j}^2 } , \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 indexes each pixel . in figure [ res70 ]",
    "we plot @xmath13 , as a function of the scale - length ( @xmath9 ) , for each galaxy and find that the image - smearing technique improves the overall correlation between the radio map and the 70  @xmath0 m image by an average of @xmath30.2  dex .",
    "unlike @xcite , we find exponential kernels are preferred independent of projection over gaussian kernels , suggesting that additional processes such as escape and decay appear necessary to describe their evolution through the galaxy disks .",
    "we find distinct behavior between our active and less active star - forming galaxies .",
    "figure [ res70 ] shows that scale - lengths @xmath141  kpc work best to improve the correlation for the more active star - forming galaxies ( ngc  5194 and ngc  6946 : sfr@xmath154 m@xmath16/yr ) , while scale - lengths @xmath171  kpc work best for the less active star - forming galaxies ( ngc  2403 and ngc  3031 : sfr @xmath141m@xmath16/yr ) .",
    "we also find that by smearing the 70  @xmath0 m images , we are able to reduce the slope of the observed non - linearity in @xmath1 with 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness by @xmath1725% for each galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the non - linearity may be due to the diffusion of cr@xmath2s and is not expected to be found in the _ global _ correlation when integrating the flux over entire galaxies .",
    "in examining the behavior of @xmath1 within the disks of our sample galaxies , along with our image - smearing analysis , we find :    1 .",
    "an empirical trend of @xmath1 decreasing with declining 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness and increasing radius to be a general property within the galaxies .",
    "however , the dispersion measured in @xmath1 at constant 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness is found to be smaller than at constant radius by @xmath30.1 dex , suggesting that star formation sites are more important in determining the @xmath1 disk appearance than the underlying exponential disks .",
    "2 .   the dispersion in the _ global _",
    "fir - radio correlation is comparable to the dispersion for @xmath1 on sub - kpc scales within the galaxy disks .",
    "also , the trend of increasing @xmath1 ratio with increasing 70  @xmath0 m luminosity within each galaxy is not observed in the _ global _ correlation .",
    "the phenomenological modeling of cosmic ray electron ( cr@xmath2 ) diffusion using an image - smearing technique is successful as it both decreases the measured dispersion in @xmath1 and reduces the slope of the observed non - linearity in @xmath1 with 70  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "the latter suggests that the non - linearity may be due to the diffusion of cr@xmath2s from star - forming regions .",
    "exponential kernels work marginally better to tighten the correlation than gaussian kernels , independent of projection .",
    "this result suggests that cr@xmath2 evolution is not well described by a pure random - walk diffusion and requires additional processes such as escape and decay .",
    "our two less active star - forming galaxies require kernels having larger scale - lengths to improve the correlation while our two more active galaxies require smaller scale - lengths .",
    "this difference may be due to time - scale effects in which there has been a deficit of recent cr@xmath2 injection into the ism of the two less active star - forming galaxies , thus leaving the underlying diffuse disk as the dominant structure in the morphology .",
