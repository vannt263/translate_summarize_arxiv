    "the galactic center region is the nucleus of the nearest spiral galaxy ; the milky way .",
    "sagittarius a@xmath4 ( sgr a@xmath4 ) is a compact source from radio to x - ray located near the dynamical center of the galaxy and is associated with the galactic central supermassive black hole ( gcbh ) .",
    "the mass of the gcbh is estimated to be @xmath6 from infrared ( ir ) astrometry observations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the region surrounding sgr a@xmath4 is recognized to be a laboratory for peculiar phenomena , which will be found in the nuclei of normal galaxies by future telescopes . in the last two decades ,",
    "young and highly luminous clusters have been found in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) ( @xcite ) by ir observations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these bright star clusters except for the central cluster presumably formed in the cradle dense molecular clouds in the cmz .",
    "however , the central cluster is a unique object in the milky way because the cluster is centered at sgr a@xmath4 and concentrates within @xmath7pc .",
    "the cluster contains @xmath8 ob and wr stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it may be difficult to make the central cluster in a way by which stars are usually formed in the disk region because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the tidal force of sgr a@xmath4 must have a serious effect on the star formation since the minimum number h@xmath9 density for stabilization toward the tidal shearing is @xmath10 @xmath11 at @xmath7pc ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the strong lyman continuum radiation from the early type stars in the cluster ionizes rapidly the ism in the region .",
    "the ionized ism stream is identified as the  galactic center mini - spiral \" surrounding sgr a@xmath4(@xcite , @xcite ) , of which elongated appearance and kinematics indicate that it is a tentative structure . therefore , it is still an open question how the central cluster has formed .",
    "two distinct scenarios for the formation of the central cluster have been proposed so far .",
    "one is current in - situ star formation in such extreme environment of the vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "the other is that a molecular cloud is fallen from the region somewhat far from sgr a@xmath4 to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 after star formation in the cloud started ( e.g. @xcite ) . recently",
    "a high - resolution observation ( @xmath12 ) within @xmath13 of sgr a@xmath4 at 34 ghz with jvla detected many sources with bow - shock appearance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the authors explained them as ionized outer envelopes of newly forming low mass stars .",
    "if so , this may be circumstantial evidence of the in - situ star formation near sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "however , the elapsed time for falling from @xmath14 pc to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 in the second scenario is @xmath15 yr , comparable to the ages of protostars in the galactic disk region .",
    "the low mass stars may remain as protostars if the low mass star formation in the falling cloud is as slow as that in the galactic disk region .",
    "consequently , the jvla - detected sources do not necessarily support the first scenario of the current in - situ star formation near sgr a@xmath4 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed observations of the survived molecular gas or partially ionized gas are necessary to understand the star formation in the the vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "recently sio(5 - 4 ) emission line observations detected several spots of molecular gas around sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "however the association between the spots and the ir - detected stars are not clear ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we analyze the alma cy.0 data of the region to depict the dust emission from the molecular cloud in the high resolution less than @xmath16 . using them",
    ", we can trace the molecular cloud before destructed completely by the uv continuum radiation . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt 8.5 kpc as the distance to the galactic center",
    ". then , @xmath16 corresponds to about 0.04 pc at the distance .",
    "we analyze the cy.0 data of the sgr a@xmath4 region in 100- , 250- , and 340-ghz bands , which was acquired from the alma archive ( ads / jao.alma#2011.0.00887.s ) .",
    "nineteen 12-m antennas were available .",
    "in addition , the epoch , may 18 , 2012 , was suitable for imaging observation because sgr a@xmath4 was in a relatively quiet phase ( @xcite ) . since the original observation aimed for the measurement of the time variation of sgr a@xmath4 , the time span of the observation is longer than 7 hrs ( from 03:30:47 ut to 10:52:16 ut ) .",

    "the beam sizes at the three bands are much smaller than the arm widths .",
    "in addition , the resolve - out limits at the three bands are much larger than the arm widths . then the difference among the widths is not caused by the beam size difference and/or the resolve - out limit difference .",

    "the observed  spine \" structure presumably shows the dust ridge in the mini - spiral . on the other hand ,",
    "the envelope structure probably shows the distribution of the ionized gas oozing from the ridge by strong uv radiation .    to explore the relation between the dust ridge of the mini - spiral and the ob / wr stars of the central cluster ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we show the positions of the stars on the emission maps at 250 and 340 ghz in the left and right panels of fig.3 , respectively .",

    "in addition , the  famous \" massive dense star cluster , irs13e , is located on the center of the brightest dust condensation in the bar ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there seems to be tight correlation between the dust emission peaks and the ob / wr stars in the northern - arm and the bar .",
    "on the other hand , the correlation between the eastern - arm and the ob stars except for irs9w is not clear because of the limitation of the fov .",
    "@xmath62 angular offset from sgr a@xmath4 of the center of the detected clump .",
    "@xmath63 projected angular distance from sgr a@xmath4 . @xmath64 minimun number density required to sustain against the tidal shear ; @xmath65 .    as the next step of the quantitative analysis of the dust emission , we search dust clumps in the 340 ghz continuum map using the _ clumpfind _ algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "we detected 18 clumps within the fov at 340 ghz .",
    "to estimate the clump mass , @xmath66 , from the integrated intensity at 340 ghz , @xmath67 , we use the formula for optically thin thermal emission from dust , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the dust mass absorption coefficient , @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume here the dust temperature of @xmath71 k as a conservative value , @xmath72 , and the metallicity of @xmath73 .",
    "the most massive core has @xmath74 m@xmath75 . when we get a new dust temperature of the clump , @xmath76 , the clump mass changes to @xmath77 because of @xmath78 .",

    "the physical parameters of the clumps are shown in table 1 .",
    "fig.4 shows the dust clump mass function ( cmf ) .",
    "the function on the high - mass side seems to obey a power - law , which is usually used to depict the cmfs in the disk region of the galaxy .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows the best - fit function for massive three data points , @xmath5 .",
    "recent ir observations suggested that the stars in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 have continuously formed with a top - heavy imf ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the slope of the mini - spiral cmf on the high - mass side is steeper than that of the expected top - heavy imf of the central cluster , the steeper cmf can change into the flat imf by the tidal shear of sgr a*. the mean gas number densities of the dust clumps are fairly less than the minimum gas density required for stability against the tidal shear of the sgr a@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the protostars already formed in the cloud could grow to stars finally because the typical number density of the protostars is larger than the minimum gas density , on the other hand the remaining cloud gas will be ruined by the tidal shear .",
    "consequently the imf should become flatter than the cmf because the tidal destruction is more effective for lower mass cores .",
    "based on the observed tight correlation between the dust emission peaks and the ob / wr stars in the northern - arm and the properties of the detected dust clumps , we would propose the following scenario as the origin of the central cluster ; the stars including massive stars have formed in a molecular cloud located at a relatively large distance from sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "the massive star formation could be triggered by cloud - cloud collision because it can easily make high - mass stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the cloud has considerably lost its angular momentum owing to the head - on collision .",
    "consequently , the star - forming cloud has fallen into the immediate vicinity of sgr a@xmath4 with the time scale of @xmath82 yr , comparable to the expected growth time of massive stars by accretion ( e.g. @xcite ) now the falling cloud is being disrupted by the tidal shear of sgr a@xmath4 and the molecular gas in the cloud is ionized by uv continuum from the ob stars of the central cluster .",
    "this is identified as the mini - spiral .",
    "because the period of the circular orbit around sgr a@xmath4 is @xmath83 yrs at @xmath84 pc ( see table 2 ) , the shearing motion would wind the mini - spiral around sgr a@xmath4 closely within @xmath85 yrs .",
    "although massive stars evolve quickly , low mass stars should be still on the stage of protostar",
    ". they may be the sources with a bow - shock appearance observed by jvla ( @xcite ) .",
    "a part of the massive stars formed in the cloud may be captured in the vicinity of sgr a * and participate in the central cluster .",
    "the captured stars probably form a disk - like structure ( cf .",
    "this is consistent with the observed disk - like distributions of the central cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
