    "observations to define the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface will simultaneously provide the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 at a given @xmath2 ( cross section across @xmath2-axis ) and the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath2 for a given @xmath3 ( cross section across @xmath3-axis ) .",

    "of the three variables , @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( or a suitable proxy such as color ) are the easiest to measure , providing access to the stellar age ( @xmath2 ) , invaluable for the chronological arrangement of stars and their companions ( including planets ) and thus for our understanding of various related astrophysical phenomena .",
    "the thickness of the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface will determine how well the theory of angular momentum evolution can be constrained and how precisely ages can be determined .",

    "the hyades and praesepe clusters constitute the oldest coeval stellar populations for which rotation periods have been measured .",
    "older stars rotate more slowly and are less active , and the lack of periods in clusters older than hyades / praesepe reflects the challenging task of measuring - from the ground - the spot - induced photometric fluctuations required to derive rotation periods .",
    "consequently , the shape and position of the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface for @xmath7myr is constrained only by the rotation period , age , and mass of a single star - the sun .",
    "( ages of field stars with measured periods are too imprecisely known to specify the surface . )",

    "@xcite is targeting three open clusters older than the hyades with the goal of deriving rotation periods for their cool main - sequence members .",
    "if successful , this effort will dramatically improve our empirical understanding of the spin - down rates of low - mass stars of different masses by verifying the existence and precisely defining the shape of the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface beyond the age of the hyades and possibly that of the sun . in this paper",
    "we report the first results from the kepler cluster study for the @xmath01gyr cluster ngc6811 .",

    "the kepler cluster study is a program to identify members of the four open clusters within the _ kepler _ field of view and to obtain and analyze _ kepler _ light curves for those members to measure stellar rotation periods and search for transiting planets .",
    "the four clusters are ngc6866 ( 0.5gyr ) , ngc6811 ( 1gyr ) , ngc6819 ( 2.5gyr ) , and ngc6791 ( 9gyr ) .",
    "as coeval , cospatial , and chemically homogeneous collections of stars with a range of masses , for which precise ages can be determined , open clusters are the best opportunity we have for studying the dependencies of rotation on the most fundamental stellar properties - age and mass .",

    "is highly contaminated with field stars ( see figure  [ cmd ] ) , making an extensive ground - based radial - velocity survey essential to identify cluster members and to improve cluster parameters . the 1gyr cluster age quoted in this study",
    "is based on the recent photometric study by @xcite who found an age of 975myr , and on an estimate of the cluster age of @xmath16gyr based on the color difference between the main sequence turnoff and the red giant clump @xcite .",
    "the latter technique is independent of the cluster reddening and only moderately sensitive to the cluster metallicity .",

    "we found no dominant frequencies and only rarely ( @xmath27 ) periodic photometric variability with an amplitude similar to those observed for members of ngc6811 for which we derived rotation periods .",
    "the sequence in the ngc6811 color - period diagram is equivalent to the sequences observed for fgk dwarfs in the hyades @xcite , praesepe @xcite , coma berenices @xcite , and m37 @xcite , and to the slow sequences seen in numerous younger open clusters for the same spectral range .",

    "the most basic implication of the ngc6811 color - period diagram is that the relatively tight sequence of rotators seen in the hyades , coma berenices , praesepe , and m37 continues to remain tight at later ages , and extends to at least 1gyr . because the rotational evolution of ( single ) cool stars is convergent",
    ", we expect that older clusters will also display similarly tight sequences .",
    "the totality of such data therefore will define the desired @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface .",
    "although based on preliminary analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data , the ngc6811 color - period diagram constitutes a proof of concept for the kepler cluster study , and represents a significant increase in our empirical knowledge of how cool stars spin down .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on color ( or equivalently @xmath3 ) defined by the ngc6811 @xmath28 sequence is a cross - section at @xmath30 of the hypothesized @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 surface .",
    "the scatter along the sequence is consistent with the measurement uncertainty ( and differential rotation ) for individual stars and confirms that the surface is intrinsically thin .",
    "this has important implications for its application to determine stellar ages from measurements of colors and rotation periods .",
    "the thinner the surface the more precisely a gyrochronology age of a star can be determined .",
    "knowing stellar ages is fundamental to understanding the time - evolution of various astronomical phenomena related to stars and their companions .",
    "for the vast majority of stars not in clusters ( unevolved late - type field stars including most exoplanet host stars ) , ages determined using the isochrone method are highly uncertain because the primary age - indicators are nearly constant throughout their main - sequence lifetimes , and because their distances and thus luminosities are poorly known .",
    "for such stars rotation could serve as a superior age indicator .",
    "the tight rotational sequence in ngc6811 will serve to further develop the technique of gyrochronology and thereby enable better ages for unevolved late - type field stars with measured periods .",
    "finally , we note that these results provide new and valuable constraints for models of angular momentum evolution .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ cpds ] displays the color - period diagram in de - reddened @xmath31 color [ transformed from @xmath17-@xmath18 using equations by @xcite and corrected by @xmath32 with the empirical color - period relation from younger clusters extrapolated to 1gyr using @xmath11 ( cross - section of orange surface in figure  [ 3d ] ) and with rotational evolution models from @xcite .",
    "the green , blue , and red theoretical curves correspond to the range of initial periods allowed on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "while preliminary , the comparison suggests that simple extrapolation , using the skumanich @xmath33 law , of the color - period relation from younger clusters can not account for the shape of the ngc6811 sequence .",
    "we emphasize that the current value for the cluster reddening is uncertain , but even with agreement for late - f and early - g dwarfs , the extrapolated and theoretical periods are longer than observed for the mid - g to early - k dwarfs .",
    "additional work is envisioned to understand this and other related issues in cool star angular momentum evolution .",
    "further analysis of ground - based spectroscopic and photometric data will enable us to improve our knowledge of cluster properties such as age , distance , and metallicity .",
    "in addition to our ongoing spectroscopic survey of the cluster we have acquired new ground - based photometric data in ubvi filters , and will use these to provided improved photometric information and reddening for the cluster in due course .",
    "we present the first results from the kepler cluster study for the open cluster ngc6811 . with rotation periods measured for 71 radial - velocity and photometric cluster members",
    ", the ngc6811 color - period diagram displays a single tight rotational sequence from mid - f to early - k spectral type .",
    "this result extends to @xmath01gyr similar sequences observed between @xmath0550 - 600myr in the hyades , praesepe , coma berenices , and m37 , and suggests that cool stars populate a thin surface in rotation - age - mass space .",
