    "the motivation for this paper is to construct discrete groups acting on the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath0 , more specifically lattices ( where one requires in addition that the quotient by the action of the discrete group have finite volume ) .",
    "complex hyperbolic spaces @xmath1 are a natural generalisation to the realm of khler geometry of the familiar non - euclidean geometry of @xmath2 . @xmath1 is simply the unit ball in @xmath3 , endowed with the unique khler metric invariant under all biholomorphisms of the ball ; this metric is symmetric and has non - constant negative real sectional curvature ( holomorphic sectional curvature is constant ) .",
    "the group of holomorphic isometries of @xmath1 is the projectivised group @xmath4 of a hermitian form of lorentzian signature @xmath5 .",
    "it is a well known fact due to borel that lattices exist in the isometry group of any symmetric space , but the general structure of lattices and the detailed study of their representation theory brings forth several open questions .",
    "the basic construction of lattices relies on the fact that for any linear algebraic group @xmath6 defined over @xmath7 , the group of integral matrices @xmath8 is a lattice in @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 is clearly discrete , and the fact that it is a lattice follows from a theorem of borel and harish - chandra . more generally , to a group defined over a number field ( i.e. a finite extension of the rationals ) , one can associate a group defined over @xmath7 by a process called restriction of scalars .",
    "one is naturally led to the general notion of _ arithmetic group _ , keeping in mind that one would like to push as far as possible the idea of taking integral matrices in a group defined over @xmath7 . for the general definition of arithmeticity",
    ", we refer the reader to section  [ sec - arithm ] . in the context of the present paper , the arithmeticity criterion in that section ( proposition  [ crit ] )",
    "will be sufficient .",
    "it is known since deep work of margulis that lattices in the isometry group of any symmetric space of higher rank ( i.e. rank @xmath10 ) are all arithmetic .",
    "there are four families of rank @xmath11 symmetric spaces of non - compact type , namely @xmath12 lattices in the isometry groups of the last two families ( hyperbolic spaces over the quaternions and the octonions ) are all known to be arithmetic , thanks to work of corlette and gromov - schoen .    on the other hand , non - arithmetic lattices are known to exist in @xmath13 ( which is the isometry group of @xmath14 ) for arbitrary @xmath15 .",
    "a handful of examples coming from coxeter groups were known in low dimensions before gromov and piatetski - shapiro found a general construction using so - called interbreeding of well - chosen arithmetic real hyperbolic lattices ( see  @xcite ) .    the existence of non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath4 ( the group of holomorphic isometries of @xmath16 ) for arbitrary @xmath17 is a longstanding open question .",
    "examples are known only for @xmath18 , and they are all commensurable to complex reflection groups .",
    "more specifically , it turns out that all known non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath4 for @xmath19 or @xmath20 are commensurable to one of the hypergeometric monodromy groups listed in  @xcite and @xcite ( the same list appears in  @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to announce ( and give outstanding evidence for ) results that exhibit several new commensurability classes of non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath21 .",
    "our starting point was the investigation by parker and paupert  @xcite of _ symmetric triangle groups _ , i.e. groups generated by three complex reflections of order @xmath22 in a symmetric configuration ( the case @xmath23 was studied by parker in @xcite ) .",
    "writing @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the generators , the symmetry condition means that there exists an isometry @xmath26 of order @xmath20 such that @xmath27 ( indices mod @xmath20 ) .",
    "it turns out that conjugacy classes of symmetric triangle groups ( with generators of any fixed order @xmath28 ) can then be parametrised by @xmath29 provided we represent isometries by matrices for @xmath30 and @xmath26 in @xmath31 ( see section  [ sec - hnc ] for basic geometric facts about complex hyperbolic spaces ) .",
    "following  @xcite , we denote by @xmath32 the group generated by @xmath30 and @xmath26 as above .",
    "the main problem is to determine the values @xmath33 of the parameters such that @xmath32 is a lattice in @xmath21 .",
    "it is a difficult problem to do this in all generality ( see the discussion in  @xcite ,  @xcite for instance ) .    to simplify matters ,",
    "we shall concentrate on a slightly smaller class of groups .",
    "the results in  @xcite give the list of all values of @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are either parabolic , or elliptic of finite order .",
    "when this condition holds , we refer to such a triangle group as _ doubly elliptic _ ( see section  [ sec - sporadic ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the double ellipticity condition is independent of @xmath37 , and the values of @xmath38 that yield doubly elliptic triangle groups come into two continuous @xmath11-parameter families , together with @xmath39 isolated values of the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the continuous families yield groups that are subgroups of so - called mostow groups , i.e. ones where the generating reflections satisfy the braid relation @xmath40 in that case , the problem of determining which parameters yield a lattice is completely solved ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite for the first family and @xcite for the second ) .",
    "the isolated values of @xmath38 corresponding to doubly elliptic triangle groups are called _ sporadic values _ , and the corresponding triangle groups are called _ sporadic triangle groups _ ( the list of sporadic values is given in table  [ tab : sporadic ] , page  ) .",
    "it has been suspected since  @xcite and  @xcite that sporadic groups may yield interesting lattices .",
    "in fact , the work in  @xcite shows that only one sporadic triangle group is an _ arithmetic _",
    "lattice ; moreover , most sporadic triangle groups are not commensurable to any of the previously known non - arithmetic lattices ( the picard , mostow and deligne - mostow lattices ) .",
    "the precise statement of what `` most sporadic groups '' means is given in theorem  [ comm ] , see also  @xcite .",
    "the question left open is of course to determine which sporadic groups are indeed lattices .    to that end , it is quite natural to use the first author s computer program ( see  @xcite ) , and to go through an experimental investigation of the dirichlet domains for sporadic groups .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to report on the results of this search , which turn out to be quite satisfactory .",
    "we summarise the results of our computer experimentation in the following ( see section  [ sec - sporadic ] , table  [ tab : sporadic ] for the meaning of the parameters @xmath41 ) :    [ conj : main ] the following sporadic groups are non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath31 :    * ( cocompact ) : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . * ( non cocompact ) : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "in fact we have obtained outstanding evidence that conjecture  [ conj : main ] is correct , but this evidence was obtained by doing numerical computations using floating point arithmetic , and it is conceivable ( though very unlikely ) that the results are flawed because of issues of precision , in a similar vein as the analysis in  @xcite of the results in  @xcite .",
    "instead of arguing that the computer experimentation is not misleading , we will prove conjecture  [ conj : main ] in @xcite by using more direct geometric methods .",
    "note that the only part of conjecture  [ conj : main ] that is conjectural is the fact that the groups in question are lattices .",
    "the fact that these groups are not arithmetic follows from the results in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the groups indicated in bold are known to not be commensurable to deligne - mostow - picard lattices by @xcite ( in fact , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 this follows from non - cocompactness by the arguments in @xcite ) .",
    "computer experiments also suggest that conjecture  [ conj : main ] is essentially optimal .",
    "more specifically , sporadic groups that do not appear in the list seem not to be lattices ( most of them are not discrete , a handful seem to have infinite covolume ) , apart from the following : @xmath54 these exceptions are in fact completely understood , and they are all arithmetic ; the last two groups are both isomorphic to the lattice studied in  @xcite ( see  @xcite ) . as for the first group ,",
    "partly thanks to work in  @xcite , we have :    @xmath55 is a cocompact arithmetic lattice in @xmath31 .    the fact that this group is discrete was proved in  @xcite ( proposition  6.4 ) , the point being that all non - trivial galois conjugates of the relevant hermitian form are definite .",
    "in fact it is the only sporadic group that is contained in an arithmetic lattice , by  @xcite . in order to check that it is cocompact",
    ", one uses the same argument as in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , one needs to verify that the dirichlet domain is cocompact . this can be done without knowing the precise combinatorics of that polyhedron ( it is enough to study a partial dirichlet domain , and to verify that all the @xmath56-faces of that polyhedron are compact , see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - discreteness results we prove in section  [ sec - nondiscrete ] of the paper are close to proving optimality of the statement of the conjecture , but the precise statement is somewhat lengthy ( see theorem  [ thm : nondiscrete ] ) . for",
    "now we simply state the following :    only finitely many sporadic triangle groups are discrete .    * acknowledgements : * this project was funded in part by the nsf grant dms-0600816 , through the funding of the first author s stay at the university of utah in september 2009 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank domingo toledo for his interest and enthusiasm for this project .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall in def .",
    "[ arithgen ] the general definition of arithmeticity ( see also  @xcite , chapter 6 ) . for the purposes of the present paper",
    "the special case of arithmetic groups arising from hermitian forms over number fields will be sufficient ( see proposition  [ crit ] below ) .",
    "borel and harish - chandra proved that if @xmath6 is a linear algebraic group defined over @xmath57 then @xmath58 is a lattice in @xmath59 .",
    "recall that a * real linear algebraic group defined over @xmath57 * is a subgroup @xmath6 of @xmath60 for some @xmath17 , such that the elements of @xmath6 are precisely the solutions of a set of polynomial equations in the entries of the matrices , with the coefficients of the polynomials lying in @xmath57 ; one denotes @xmath61 and @xmath62 . from their result",
    ", one can deduce that any real semisimple lie group contains infinitely many ( distinct commensurability classes of ) lattices , either cocompact or non cocompact .",
    "one obtains the general definition by extending this notion to all groups equivalent to groups of the form @xmath58 in the following sense :    [ arithgen ] let @xmath6 be a semisimple lie group , and @xmath63 a subgroup of @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath63 is an _",
    "arithmetic lattice _ in @xmath6",
    "if there exist an algebraic group @xmath64 defined over @xmath57 and a continuous homomorphism @xmath65 with compact kernel such that @xmath63 is commensurable to @xmath66 .",
    "the fact that @xmath63 as in the definition is indeed a lattice follows from the borel  harish - chandra theorem .",
    "here we focus on the case of _ integral groups arising from hermitian forms over number fields_. this means that we consider groups @xmath63 which are contained in @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a number field , @xmath69 denotes its ring of algebraic integers , and @xmath70 is a hermitian form of signature @xmath71 with coefficients in @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath69 is usually not discrete in @xmath72 , so @xmath73 is usually not discrete in @xmath74 . under an additional assumption on",
    "the galois conjugates @xmath75 of the form ( obtained by applying field automorphisms @xmath76 to the entries of the representative matrix of @xmath70 ) , the group @xmath73 is indeed discrete ( see part 1 of prop .  [ crit ] ) .",

    "then @xmath63 is arithmetic if and only if @xmath82 not inducing the identity on @xmath78 , the form @xmath83 is definite .",
    "part 1 of the proposition is quite natural ( and motivates the formulation of the general definition of arithmeticity ) .",
    "indeed , it is a general fact that one can embed @xmath69 discretely into @xmath84 by @xmath85 where @xmath86 denote the distinct embeddings of @xmath68 into the complex numbers ( up to complex conjugation ) .    the group @xmath87 can be checked to be defined over @xmath57 ( this is an instance of a general process called _ restriction of scalars _ ) .",
    "its integer points correspond to @xmath88 , which is a lattice in @xmath89 by the theorem of borel and harish - chandra .",
    "now the key point is that the assumption on the galois conjugates amounts to saying that the projection @xmath90 onto the first factor has compact kernel , hence maps discrete sets to discrete sets ( compare with definition  [ arithgen ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath73 is a lattice in @xmath74 .",
