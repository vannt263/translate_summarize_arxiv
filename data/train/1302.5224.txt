    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is supported by an enormous amount of evidence to date , and there is no doubt about its validity , at least in the planar limit . an attractive direction in the study of ads",
    "/ cft is to consider its applications to realistic systems such as qcd @xcite and condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "( for reviews , for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "our purpose here is to consider holographic descriptions of nonequilibrium states dynamically relaxing to the equilibrium state .",
    "since ads spaces correspond to equilibrium states , the gravitational solutions should be time dependent and describe a time evolution to ads spaces .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to consider time - dependent ads / cft .",
    "it is of great importance to understand how to describe nonequilibrium systems holographically in order to obtain the deeper understanding of gravity and ads / cft itself .    in this paper",
    "we construct time - dependent lifshitz - type exact solutions in type iib supergravity and argue their holographic descriptions .",
    "we show some evidence to support that the solutions describe a class of nonequilibrium phenomena called the aging @xcite , which are observed , for example , in glassy materials .",
    "the phenomena are characterized by the following three features : ( 1 ) no time - translation invariance , ( 2 ) the dynamical scaling with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 and ( 3 ) slow ( nonexponential ) relaxation .",
    "the solutions we construct here satisfy all of them . for earlier holographic approaches to the aging ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one of the techniques to prepare nonequilibrium states is quenching the system .",
    "there are various ways of quenching . since we consider the zero - temperature solutions , a quantum quench , which suddenly changes a coupling constant , plays a central role our analysis .",
    "we also explain a mechanism of the quantum quench encoded into the gravitational solutions .",
    "another aspect of the subject is its potential application to realistic cosmological models .",
    "the construction of the time - dependent lifshitz - type solutions is similar to that of dynamical brane solutions @xcite , which provide the friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "indeed , a dynamical universe is also obtained from the lifshitz - type solutions , though there are some undesirable aspects .",
    "let us consider d3-brane solutions with waves in type iib supergravity . we take account of the metric @xmath4 , dilaton @xmath5 , axion @xmath6 and the self - dual five - form field strength @xmath7",
    ". then the field equations are given by @xmath8=0\\ , , \\quad   f_{(5)}=\\ast f_{(5)}\\ , , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the hodge operator in ten dimensions .",
    "we are concerned with a time - dependent generalization of @xmath10 schrdinger spacetimes in type iib supergravity .",
    "hence the following ansatz is supposed , @xmath11    + h^{1/2}(r ) \\bigl[dr^2+r^2d\\omega_{(5)}^2\\bigr]\\ , , \\label{general - sol}\\ ] ] which is equipped with @xmath12\\ , , \\quad   \\phi=\\phi_0\\ , , \\quad f_{\\left(1\\right)}=k\\,du\\ , , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are constants and @xmath15 describes the five - dimensional sphere with unit radius .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not determined yet .",
    "the general forms of them are given by , respectively , @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant parameters . when @xmath21 , ( [ general - sol ] ) is reduced to the general solutions preserving the @xmath10 schrdinger symmetry @xcite .",
    "nonvanishing @xmath22 and @xmath23 break time - translation invariance and phase - rotation symmetry , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath24 can always be removed by shifting @xmath25 as @xmath26 , up to the redefinition of @xmath22 .",
    "henceforth , we will set @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider the solution ( [ general - sol ] ) with @xmath28 , for simplicity .",
    "then the near - horizon limit leads to the following metric , @xmath29   + \\frac{l^2}{r^2}dr^2 + l^2d\\omega_{(5)}^2\\ , ,   \\label{schrodinger}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the following quantities , @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the string coupling constant .",
    "it is necessary to take the string coupling @xmath32 so as to ignore graviton loop effects .",
    "this condition is ensured by taking the scaling limit , @xmath33 as well as the usual scaling limit , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of d3-branes .",
    "note that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are fixed to be two independent constants .    when @xmath38 , the metric ( [ schrodinger ] ) is the direct product of the @xmath10 schrdinger spacetime and the five - dimensional sphere s@xmath39 with the unit radius .",
    "however , the constant shift symmetry for @xmath25 is broken when @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the nonvanishing @xmath23 breaks the phase rotation in the schrdinger algebra with @xmath10 .    in summary ,",
    "the metric ( [ schrodinger ] ) is invariant under ( i ) a constant shift of @xmath41 , ( ii ) spatial translations of @xmath42  ( i=1 , 2 ) , ( iii ) a rotation on the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane , ( iv ) galilean symmetries and ( v ) the scale transformation with @xmath10 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant parameter .",
    "the next step is to derive time - dependent lifshitz - type solutions by applying the trick in @xcite to the solutions ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ schrodinger ] ) is first rewritten as @xmath47 since the @xmath41 direction is still invariant under a constant shift , one may impose a periodic boundary condition for this direction .",
    "the boundary condition breaks the galilean symmetries as shown in @xcite .",
    "now that the coordinate @xmath25 can be regarded as the time direction rather than @xmath41 , the geometry should be understood as a time - dependent lifshitz spacetime .",
    "the remaining symmetry is close to the aging algebra @xcite , but special conformal and galilean symmetries are not contained .",
    "note that a problem happens in the kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction .",
    "this is an intrinsic point to the dynamical case .",
    "the radius of compactification is not small everywhere in comparison to the characteristic length - scale @xmath20 of the solutions . to make matters worse",
    ", it even shrinks to zero when @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the compactification produces another curvature singularity , apart from divergent tidal forces intrinsic to lifshitz and schrdinger spacetime @xcite .",
    "indeed , when @xmath48 , the kk - gauge field also diverges .",
    "to see the time evolution of the solutions ( [ lifshitz ] ) , we use the following coordinates : @xmath49 then the metric ( [ lifshitz ] ) is rewritten as @xmath50   + l^2 d\\omega_{(5)}^2 \\nonumber \\\\   & &    + \\frac{k^2 g_s^2}{4}f(z,\\tau)l^2\\left ( du   + \\frac{2}{kg_s z^2 f(z,\\tau)}d\\tau\\right)^2\\ , ,   \\label{relaxation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the following quantities : @xmath51 we assume that @xmath52 hereafter and @xmath53 is later regarded as a microscopic time scale .",
    "we first consider the time evolution for @xmath57 . as time progresses , the metric ( [ relaxation ] )",
    "tends to deviate from the lifshitz at @xmath58 .",
    "it is convenient to divide the spacetime into the following two regions at a fixed time @xmath59 : @xmath60 in the near - horizon region , it still remains the lifshitz spacetime . to evaluate the behavior of the metric in the near - boundary region , we take the @xmath61 limit .",
    "then 1 in @xmath62 is ignored . by performing the coordinate transformation , @xmath63 the metric ( [ relaxation ] )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath64   + l^2 d\\omega_{(5)}^2   + \\left(\\frac{l\\tau'}{2kg_s z \\tau_0}\\right)^2\\left ( du   + \\frac{2kg_s \\tau_0}{\\tau'}d\\tau'\\right)^2\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] thus the usual ads metric has been reproduced .",
    "this implies that the lifshitz spacetime at @xmath65 tends to decay to the ads space from the boundary as @xmath61 .",
    "the time evolution is shown in fig .  [ evolution : fig ] .",
    "note that the compactification radius is large enough in the near - boundary region or late time and , hence , the kk direction is effectively decompactified in the ads region .",
    "the next issue is to study the conformal boundary of the solutions ( [ relaxation ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to go back to the coordinate @xmath66 .",
    "then the metric is expressed as @xmath67 + \\frac{l^2}{r^2 } dr^2   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\\\   & & ~~~~~~~~+ l^2 d\\omega_{(5)}^2 + \\frac{r^2}{2l^2 } \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_0}\\right)g(r , \\tau ) \\left(du + \\frac{kg_s}{g(r , \\tau)}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_0 } { \\tau}\\right)d\\tau\\right)^2 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined a new function , @xmath68 then by performing a conformal transformation for the metric as @xmath69 with the conformal factor , @xmath70 and by taking the limit @xmath71 , the metric becomes @xmath72 and describes a dynamical universe with a power - law expansion .",
    "it is notable that the conformal boundary is well defined , differently from the lifshitz spacetime .",
    "one may think that there is an external force to drive the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , the time dependence in @xmath42 directions comes from the time - dependent conformal factor ( [ factor ] ) .",
    "it makes the length scale on the boundary time dependent .",
    "this situation is described as the dynamical universe .",
    "thus , the expansion is superficial .",
    "indeed , the time dependence disappears by taking @xmath73 introduced in ( [ cosmic ] ) .",
    "then the time - independent conformal factor leads to minkowski spacetime , up to the dynamical s@xmath74 part .",
    "let us argue what happens in the boundary theory from the bulk structure .",
    "now the ads / cft dictionary tells us that the short - distance physics is dominated by the bulk ads space corresponding to equilibrium states . on the other hand",
    ", the lifshitz spacetime influences the long - distance physics , and it may be regarded as nonequilibrium states ( see fig .",
    "[ length : fig ] ) .",
    "this means that there exists no long - range order , only ordered structure like the crystalline lattice at short distances , such as that found in the materials that exhibit the aging phenomena .",
    "the correlation length of equilibrium state depends on time because of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the time dependence is evaluated as @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be evaluated holographically by using the middle point value of the @xmath77 direction , @xmath78 , as in fig .",
    "[ length : fig ] .",
    "this time dependence agrees with @xmath79 in the aging phenomena with @xmath0 .",
    "now the physical meaning of @xmath53 is also obvious .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath81 vanishes and , hence , no relaxation occurs .",
    "the whole geometry of the bulk is the lifshitz spacetime . when @xmath82 , @xmath83 becomes infinite , and the system is completely relaxed .",
    "then the whole bulk is the ads space .",
    "thus , @xmath53 should be identified with a typical relaxation time at microscopic scale .",
    "finally let us discuss the behavior of the solutions ( [ relaxation ] ) when @xmath84 .",
    "there is a curvature singularity when @xmath85 .",
    "the location of the singularity is @xmath86 and depends on time @xmath59 .",
    "it appears from the horizon at @xmath87 , and it goes up to the boundary and finally runs into the boundary at @xmath88 . the time evolution for @xmath84 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ bump : fig ] . in the region",
    "where @xmath89 , the @xmath59 coordinate can not be regarded as the time direction any more .",
    "the metric in this region behaves as a euclidean ads ( eads ) space and the @xmath41 direction becomes timelike .",
    "now that the @xmath41 direction is compactified , a closed timelike curve exists in this region .",
    "the bump of the singularity may be interpreted as a quantum quench to produce nonequilibrium states .",
    "the effective time - dependent coupling @xmath90 , defined as @xmath91 diverges rapidly as @xmath92 , and this may be understood as a holographic description of quantum quench @xcite .    in conclusion , we have shown time - dependent lifshitz - type solutions in type iib supergravity and discussed the time evolution in relation to the aging phenomena .",
    "it is nice to look for more general solutions corresponding to more complicated processes .",
    "a finite - temperature generalization is especially interesting .    as another aspect ,",
    "our solutions give rise to a dynamical universe with a power - law expansion .",
    "this universe is not isotropic because of the kk circle expanding with time , and hence it would be difficult to construct realistic models in the present setup . it is interesting to look for other setups applicable to building the realistic model .",
