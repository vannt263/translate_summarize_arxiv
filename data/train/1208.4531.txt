    "entanglement is a genuine quantum correlation between two or more parties , with no analogue in classical physics . during last decades",
    "it has been recognized as a fundamental tool in several quantum information protocols , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite , and distributed quantum computing @xcite .    nowadays , spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , a process where the interaction of a strong pump beam with a nonlinear crystal mediates the emission of two lower - frequency photons ( signal and idler ) , is a very convenient way to generate photonic entanglement @xcite .",
    "photons generated in spdc can exhibit entanglement in the polarization degree of freedom @xcite , frequency @xcite and spatial shape @xcite .",
    "one can also make use of a combination of several degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "two - photon entanglement in the polarization degree of freedom is undoubtedly the most common type of generated entanglement , due both to its simplicity , and that it suffices to demonstrate a myriad of important quantum information applications .",
    "but the amount of entanglement is restricted to @xmath0 ebit of entropy of entanglement @xcite , since each photon of the pair can be generally described by the superposition of two orthogonal polarizations ( two - dimensional hilbert space ) . on the other hand , frequency and spatial entanglement",
    "occurs in an infinite dimensional hilbert space , offering thus the possibility to implement entanglement that inherently lives in a higher dimensional hilbert space ( qudits ) .",
    "entangling systems in higher dimensional systems ( frequency and spatial degrees of freedom ) is important both for fundamental and applied reasons .",
    "for example , noise and decoherence tend to degrade quickly quantum correlations . however , theoretical investigations predict that physical systems with increasing dimensions can maintain non - classical correlations in the presence of more hostile noise @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional states can also exhibit unique outstanding features .",
    "the potential of higher - dimensional quantum systems for practical applications is clearly illustrated in the demonstration of the so - called _ quantum coin tossing _",
    ", where the power of higher dimensional spaces is clearly visible @xcite .",
    "the amount of spatial entanglement generated depends of the spdc geometry used ( collinear vs non - collinear ) , the length of the nonlinear crystal ( @xmath1 ) and the size of the pump beam ( @xmath2 ) . to obtain an initial estimate ,",
    "let us consider a collinear spdc geometry . under certain approximations @xcite ,",
    "the entropy of entanglement can be calculated analytically .",
    "its value can be shown to depend on the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rayleigh range of the pump beam and @xmath5 is its longitudinal wavenumber .",
    "therefore , large values of the pump beam waist @xmath2 and short crystals are ingredients for generating high entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , the use of shorter crystals also reduce the total flux - rate of generated entangled photon pairs .",
    "moreover , certain applications might benefit from the use of focused pump beams .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath6 mm long stoichiometric lithium tantalate ( slt ) crystal , with pump beam waist @xmath7 @xmath8 m , pump wavelength @xmath9 nm and extraordinary refractive index @xmath10 @xcite , one obtains @xmath11 @xcite . for a longer crystal of @xmath12 mm , the amount of entanglement",
    "is severely reduced to @xmath13 ebits .",
    "we put forward here a scheme to generate massive spatial entanglement , i. e. , an staggering large value of the entropy of entanglement , independently of some relevant experimental parameters such as the crystal length or the pump beam waist .",
    "this would allow to reach even larger amounts of entanglement that possible nowadays with the usual configurations used , or to attain the same amount of entanglement but with other values of the nonlinear crystal length or the pump beam waist better suited for specific experiments .",
    "our approach is based on a scheme originally used to increase the bandwidth of parametric down - conversion @xcite . a schematic view of the spdc configuration is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it makes use of chirped quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) gratings with a linearly varying spatial frequency given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the grating s spatial frequency at its entrance face ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is a parameter that represents the degree of linear chirp .",
    "the period of the grating at distance @xmath18 is @xmath19 , so that the parameter @xmath17 writes @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the period at the entrance face of the crystal , and @xmath22 at its output face .     and",
    "@xmath23 designate the transverse wave numbers of the signal and idler photons , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the grating wave - vector at the input face of the nonlinear crystal , and @xmath24 at its output face .",
    "the signal and idler photons can have different polarizations or frequencies .",
    "the different colors ( or different direction of arrows ) represent domains with different sign of the nonlinear coefficient.,width=245 ]    the key idea is that at different points along the nonlinear crystal , signal and idler photons with different frequencies and transverse wavenumbers can be generated , since the continuous change of the period of the qpm gratings allows the fulfillment of the phase - matching conditions for different frequencies and transverse wavenumbers .",
    "if appropriately designed narrow - band interference filters allow to neglect the frequency degree of freedom of the two - photon state , the linearly chirped qpm grating enhance only the number of spatial modes generated , leading to a corresponding enhancement of the amount of generated spatial entanglement .     for ( a ) @xmath25 and ( b ) @xmath26 .",

    "in order to determine how much spatial entanglement can be generated in spdc with the use of chirped qpm , let us consider a nonlinear optical crystal illuminated by a quasi - monochromatic laser gaussian pump beam of waist @xmath2 . under conditions of collinear propagation of the pump , signal and idler photons with no poynting vector walk - off , which would be the case of a noncritical type - ii quasi - phase matched configuration , the amplitude of the quantum state of the generated two - photon pair generated in spdc reads in transverse wavenumber space @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the transverse wavenumber of the signal ( idler ) photon .",

    "( [ state3 ] ) is similar to the one describing the joint spectrum of photon pairs in the frequency domain , when the spatial degree of freedom is omitted @xcite .",
    "the reason is that both equations originate in phase matching conditions along the propagation direction ( @xmath40 axis ) .    since all the configuration parameters that define the down conversion process show rotational symmetry along the propagation direction @xmath18 , the joint amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ state3 ] ) can be written as @xmath41 here , we have made use of polar coordinates in the transverse wave - vector domain for the signal , @xmath42 , and idler photons @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are the corresponding azimuthal angles , and @xmath45 are the radial coordinates .",
    "the specific dependence of the schmidt decomposition on the azimuthal variables @xmath46 and @xmath46 reflects the conservation of orbital angular momentum in this spdc configuration @xcite , so that a signal photon with oam winding number @xmath47 is always accompanied by a corresponding idler photon with oam winding number @xmath48 .",
    "the probability of such coincidence detection for each value of @xmath49 is the spiral spectrum @xcite of the two - photon state , i.e. , the set of values @xmath50 .",
    "recently , the spiral spectrum of some selected spdc configuration have been measured @xcite .",

    "an estimation of the overall number of spatial modes generated is obtained via the schmidt number @xmath56 , which can be interpreted as a measure of the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "finally , the spiral spectrum is obtained as @xmath57 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , let us consider first the usual case of a qpm slt crystal with no chirp , i.e. , @xmath58 , and length @xmath12 mm , pumped by a gaussian beam with beam waist @xmath59 and wavelength @xmath9 nm . in this case , the integration of eq .",

    "the main contribution to the spiral spectrum comes from the spatial modes with @xmath61 .",
    "the entropy of entanglement for this case is @xmath62 ebits and the schmidt number is @xmath63 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    we have discussed entanglement in terms of transverse modes which arise from the schmidt decomposition of the two - photon amplitude and , as such , they attain appreciable values in the whole transverse plane .",
    "alternatively , the existing spatial correlations between the signal and idler photons can also be discussed using second - order intensity correlation functions @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "correlations are quantified by the size of the correlated area ( @xmath77 ) where it is highly probable to detect a signal photon provided that its idler twin has been detected with a fixed transverse wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the azimuthal width of correlated area decreases with the increasing width of the distribution of schmidt eigenvalues along the oam winding number @xmath49 . on the other hand , the increasing width of the distribution of schmidt eigenvalues along the remaining number @xmath78 results in a narrower radial extension of the correlated area .",
    "an increase in the number of modes @xmath70 results in a diminishing correlation area , both in the radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "the correlated area drops to zero in the limit of plane - wave pumping , where attains the form of a @xmath79 function .",
    "the use of such correlations in parallel processing of information represents the easiest way for the exploitation of massively multi - mode character of the generated beams .    for the sake of comparison , when considering frequency entanglement , the entropy of entanglement depends on the ratio between the bandwidth of the pump beam ( typically @xmath80 mhz ) and the bandwidth of the down - converted two - photon state ( @xmath81 ) @xcite . for type ii spdc",

    ", one can reach values of @xmath83 thz , therefore allowing typical ratios greater than @xmath84 , with @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a new way to increase significantly the amount of two - photon spatial entanglement generated in spdc by means of the use of chirped quasi - phase - matching nonlinear crystals .",
    "this opens the door to the generation of high entanglement under various experimental conditions , such as different crystal lengths and sizes of the pump beam .",
    "qpm engineering can also be an enabling tool to generate truly massive spatial entanglement , with state of the art qpm technologies @xcite potentially allowing to reach entropies of entanglement of tens of ebits .",
    "therefore , the promise of reaching extremely high degrees of entanglement , offered by the use of the spatial degree of freedom , can be fulfilled with the scheme put forward here .",
    "the experimental tools required are available nowadays .",
    "the use of extremely high degrees of spatial entanglement , as consider here , would demand the implementation of high aperture optical systems .",
    "for instance , for a spatial bandwidth of @xmath86 , the aperture required for @xmath9 nm is @xmath87 .",
    "the shaping of qpm gratings are commonly used in the area of non - linear optics for multiple applications such as beam and pulse shaping , harmonic generation and all - optical processing @xcite . in the realm of quantum optics ,",
    "its uses are not so widespread , even though qpm engineering has been considered , and experimentally demonstrated , as a tool for spatial @xcite and frequency @xcite control of entangled photons . in view of the results obtained here concerning the enhancement of the degree of spatial entanglement",
    ", it could be possible to devise new types of gratings that turn out to be beneficial for other applications in the area of quantum optics .",
