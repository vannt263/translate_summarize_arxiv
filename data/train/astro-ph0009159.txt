    "it is now well established that the hot subluminous b stars can be identified with models of the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb , heber , 1986 , saffer et al .",
    "their photospheric chemical composition is governed by diffusion processes leading to strong peculiarities ( e.g. deficiencies of helium , carbon and silicon in some stars ) with strong variations from star to star ( for a review see heber , 1998 ) .",
    "recently , several sdb stars have been found to be pulsating ( termed ec14026 stars after the prototype , see odonoghue et al .",
    "1999 for a review ) , defining a new instability strip in the hr - diagram .",
    "the study of these pulsators offers the possibility of applying the tools of asteroseismology to investigate the structure of sdb stars .",
    "the existence of pulsating sdb stars was predicted by charpinet et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who uncovered an efficient driving mechanism due to an opacity bump associated with iron ionization in ehb models . however , in order to drive the pulsations , iron needed to be enhanced in the appropriate subphotospheric layers , possibly due to diffusion .",
    "subsequently , charpinet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) confirmed this assumption by detailed diffusion calculations .",
    "even more encouraging was the agreement of the observed and predicted instability strip .",
    "eighteen pulsating sdb stars are well - studied photometrically ( see odonoghue et al .",
    "1999 for a review , and billres et al .",
    "2000 , silvotti et al . 2000 and",
    "stensen et al .",
    "2000 for more recent discoveries ) . a precise knowledge of effective temperature , gravity , element abundances and rotation is a prerequisite for the asteroseismological investigation .",
    "we selected four ec14026 stars for a detailed quantitative spectral analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ pulshrd ] ) : pg@xmath31605@xmath0072 was chosen because it has the lowest gravity and , therefore , has probably already evolved beyond the extreme horizontal branch phase",
    ". it also displays the richest frequency spectrum amongst the ec@xmath314026 stars ( @xmath650 periods have been identified , kilkenny al .",
    "the results of an spectral analysis have already been reported by heber et al .",
    "recently , kawaler ( 1999 ) predicted from his modelling of the pulsations that pg@xmath31605@xmath0072 should be rotating .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by the analysis of optical spectra from which a projected rotational velocity of v@xmath7sini=39km / s was derived ( heber et al . , 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we present the spectral analysis of three additional pulsating sdb stars .",
    "pg@xmath31219@xmath0534 was chosen because it has the shortest pulsation periods and has a helium abundance larger than most other sdb stars ( odonoghue et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "feige@xmath348 was selected because it is the coolest of all ec@xmath314026 stars known ( koen et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the effective temperature and gravity of kpd2109 + 4401 ( billres et al . , 1998 ) places the star in the parameter space where most ec14026 stars are found ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for feige@xmath348 and kpd@xmath32109@xmath04401 only few frequencies ( four for the former , five for the latter ) have been found so far .",
    "high resolution optical spectra were obtained with the hires echelle spectrograph ( vogt et al . 1994 ) on the keck i telescope on july 20 , 1998 using the blue cross disperser to cover the full wavelength region between 3700  and 5200at a resolution 0.09 .",
    "the spectra are integrated over one pulsation cycle or more since the exposure times ( 600900s ) were long compared to the pulsational periods .",
    "the standard data reduction as described by zuckerman & reid ( 1998 ) resulted in spectral orders that have a somewhat wavy continuum . in order to remove the waviness we used the spectrum of h1504@xmath065 ( a very hot pre - white dwarf devoid of hydrogen and helium , werner 1991 ) which was observed in the same night .",
    "its spectrum has only few weak lines of highly ionized metals in the blue ( 36004480 ) where the strong balmer lines are found in the sdb stars .",
    "therefore we normalized individual spectral orders 1 to 20 ( 36004480 ) of the sdb stars by dividing through the smoothed spectrum of h1504@xmath065 .",
    "the remaining orders were normalized by fitting the continuum with spline functions ( interpolated for orders 26 and 27 which contain h@xmath8 ) . judged from the match of line profiles in the overlapping parts of neighboring orders",
    "this procedure worked extremely well .",
    "atmospheric parameters determined from individual balmer lines are found to be consistent with each other except for h@xmath8 .",
    "since this might be a result of interpolation errors in the normalization process , we excluded h@xmath8 from the fit procedure . besides the strong balmer lines of hydrogen , helium lines are present in all three stars",
    "however , 4686  is detected in kpd2109 + 4401 and pg1219 + 534 , only .",
    "in addition , weak photospheric metal lines can be identified in the spectra of all programme stars .",
    "however , the number of detectable photospheric lines differs considerably .",
    "the largest number of metal lines is present in feige@xmath348 ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , al , s and fe ) . in pg@xmath31219@xmath0534 and kpd2109 + 4401",
    "only n , s and fe are detectable .",
    "also interstellar lines are present and are found to have a complex structure ( three to four components , see appendix ) .",
    "the simultaneous fitting of balmer line profiles by a grid of synthetic spectra has become the standard technique to determine the atmospheric parameters of hot high gravity stars ( bergeron et al .",
    "the procedure has been extended to include helium line profiles as well and applied successfully to sdb stars by saffer et al .",
    "it will be referred to as saffer s procedure throughout this paper .",
    "the balmer lines ( h@xmath9 to h@xmath312 ) , he  i ( 4471 , 4026 , 4922 , 4713 , 5016 , 5048 ) and he  ii 4686  lines are fitted to derive all three parameters simultaneously .    the analysis is based on an updated version of the lte model atmosphere code of heber et al . (",
    "1984a ) which includes metal line blanketing using kurucz atlas6 opacity distribution functions .",
    "a large grid of models is calculated for various helium abundances and solar metalicity as well as for metal poor ( [ m / h]=-2.0 ) composition ( see heber et al .",
    "versionai26/linfit / linfor.html ] of the linfor program ( developed originally by holweger , steffen , and steenbock at kiel university ) is used to compute a grid of theoretical spectra which include the balmer lines h@xmath10 to h@xmath11 and and lines . as can be seen from tables [ res_f48 ] ,",
    "[ res_kpd ] and [ res_pg1219 ] the metalicity dependence of the results is marginal , the effective temperature changes by 600k , the gravity by 0.02 dex and the helium abundance by 0.09 dex at the most when we apply saffer s procedure with the metal poor lte grid ( [ m / h]=-2.0 ) instead of the solar composition grid .",
    "tests using models calculated with kurucz atlas9 code were also performed .",
    "no significant deviations of the fit results from those listed in table  1 were found . in order to investigate the role of nlte effects we repeated the analyses using a grid of h -",
    "he line blanketed , metal free nlte model atmospheres ( napiwotzki 1997 ) , calculated with the ali code of werner & dreizler ( 1999 ) . applying saffer s procedure with the nlte model grid ( see tables  [ res_f48 ] , [ res_kpd ] and [ res_pg1219 ] ) yields  and @xmath12  almost identical to that obtained from the lte grid .",
    "we therefore conclude that the balmer and helium lines are not vulnerable to nlte effects .    however , a systematic difference in logg persists , the lte values being higher by 0.1 dex than the nlte results ( see table  [ res_f48 ] ) .",
    "since its origin is obscure , we finally adopted the averaged atmospheric parameters given in tables  [ res_f48 ] , [ res_kpd ] and [ res_pg1219 ] .",
    "the metal lines are sufficiently isolated to derive abundances from their equivalent widths again using the linfor program .",
    "oscillator strengths were taken from the critical compilation of wiese et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for c , n and o , from the opacity project ( seaton , 1987 ) for , and using the opacity project data base `` topbase '' ( cunto & mendoza , 1992 ) at the cds ( strasbourg ) , from becker & butler ( 1990 ) for si , wiese et al .",
    "( 1969 ) for , and ekberg ( 1993 ) and kurucz ( 1992 ) for .",
    "the oscillator strengths for some lines of light elements which could not be found in the papers cited were supplemented from kurucz line list , from which also the damping constants for all metal lines were extracted .",
    "equivalent widths of metal lines between 5m  and 79m  were measured .",
    "since fewer metal lines are present in the spectra of kpd2109 + 4401 and pg1219 + 534 than in those of feige48 and pg1605 + 072 , we use the latter spectra as guidance to determine upper limits for metal abundances of the former from the absence of the presumedly strongest lines of the ions in question . an upper limit to their equivalent width of 5m  was assumed .",
    "the results of the analysis of the h and lines for feige 48 are listed in table  [ res_f48 ] and compared to published values obtained from low resolution spectra .",
