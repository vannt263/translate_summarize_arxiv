    "nonlinear optical effects are usually considered weak .",
    "for example , typical second - order nonlinear processes such as second harmonic generation have efficiencies of a few percent for nonlinear crystals a few mm in length  @xcite .",
    "third - order nonlinear effects are usually weaker and occur on even longer distances , see for example , self - phase modulation in optical fibers  @xcite or even in highly nonlinear semiconductor waveguides  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the vast majority of theoretical studies of nonlinear optical effects are performed within the framework of a perturbative description , i.e. , involving , at most , a third - order ( equivalently , cubic ) nonlinearity .",
    "ultrafast nonlinearities are particularly weak .",
    "however , even the much stronger slow nonlinearities are limited to modest permittivity changes due to saturation effects ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , phase transitions ( e.g. , in liquid crystals ) , or damage .    here ,",
    "we study a case , unique , to the best of our knowledge , whereby the perturbative description is insufficient , sometimes even requiring to go beyond a cubic - quintic nonlinearity to a full non - perturbative description .",
    "in particular , we consider a continuous wave ( cw ) illumination of a few nm metal sphere .",
    "we will focus on the _ thermal _ effect , known to be among the strongest sources of optical nonlinearity , with the dual aim of demonstrating the failure of the perturbative ( cubic ) description and identifying the importance of the various underlying physical effects .",
    "while doing so , we will elucidate the quantitative and qualitative differences between the strength of the thermal nonlinearity in the ultrafast and cw cases . this is important because while the former is well - studied , the latter , i.e. , the cw case , has been practically ignored .    in that sense",
    ", this study was motivated by recent measurements of the extremely strong scattering of intense cw light from small metal particles  @xcite , which , although being conceptually simple , are first of their kind .",
    "further , this study was made possible by recent ellipsometry measurements of metal permittivities at elevated temperatures  @xcite .",
    "thus , although we present here rather simple theoretical calculations , we emphasize that the approach is quite realistic . indeed , it was already shown in  @xcite that the thermal effect reproduces _",
    "qualitatively _ the experimental results of  @xcite . in the current article",
    ", we go beyond  @xcite and study this problem systematically and quantitatively , classifying the importance of the various contributing physical effects using numerical simulations and an approximate analysis .",
    "we identify qualitative differences between au and ag spheres , as well as between various hosts .",
    "this allows us to show that unless the host undergoes a phase transition ( e.g. , boiling ) , it has a relatively smaller role compared to the metal .",
    "overall , all cases require a description beyond the standard perturbative description of the nonlinear response . in some cases ,",
    "a cubic - quintic nonlinear response can capture the intensity dependence of the temperature , permittivity and field , while in other cases , a full non - perturbative description is required .",
    "this study provides an important step towards reaching a quantitative understanding of the nonlinear scattering observed in  @xcite ( i.e. , matching theoretical predictions to the experimental data ) .",
    "it also allows us to predict so far unobserved behaviour , so that if observed experimentally , further support to the claims of the dominance of the thermal effects will be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we describe the basic assumptions of the model , and in section  [ sec : model ] we develop the model equations for the temperature , permittivity and field within the nanosphere .",
    "we then proceed by several numerical examples ( section  [ sec : examples ] ) and complement the numerical results with an approximate analysis ( section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] provides a discussion of the results and an outlook .",
    "in what follows , we denote the quantities within the metal nanosphere ( host ) with a subscript @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and label the ambient properties by a @xmath2 superscript .",
    "we consider spheres which are sufficiently small so that the field and temperature within the metal nanosphere ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) are approximated as being uniform .",
    "the former assumption , known as the quasi - static approximation , is justified for particles sufficiently small with respect to the wavelength ; the latter is valid when the host has a relatively lower thermal conductivity compared with the sphere ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) .",
    "we assume that the nanospheres exhibit only linear ( one - photon ) absorption . while we do not expect multi - photon absorption to yield anything more than a quantitative change to the results shown below , it is also worth noting that the absorption cross - sections of multi - photon processes are difficult to distinguish from the many other effects ( e.g. , the thermal effect , free - carrier generation , stress / strain etc . ) , and are in general not well characterized , hence , difficult to quantify at this stage .",
    "further , we assume a linear dependence of the permittivity on the temperature , namely , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the temperature of the host away from the nanosphere .",
    "this was shown to be the case at least up to several hundreds of degrees in recent ellipsometry measurements of au  @xcite thin films ; the data in these studies was remarkably similar and was in excellent agreement with an earlier study  @xcite performed over a narrower temperature range .",
    "similar behaviour was also seen for a ag film  @xcite , which describes probably the most detailed study , to date , of the temperature dependence of the ag permittivity ( in terms of wavelength and temperature range ) ; it also includes an attempt to eliminate the effects of roughness , and is complemented with a first - principles calculation of the permittivity .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in contrast to the case of au , the ag results of  @xcite were not always in agreement with earlier studies ; the authors of  @xcite included a detailed comparison and a discussion of the possible reasons for these differences .",
    "the most probable reason is the relatively large grain size , and the potential modification of the metal volume morphology at high temperatures , during and after the measurement themselves , see corresponding discussion in  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we assume for the host media that @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we assume that the thermal conductivity also varies linearly with temperature , i.e. , @xmath9 . under the current conditions ,",

    "we ignore strain / stress that may develop within the solid host due to the heating .",
    "these effects may only increase the nonlinear response .",

    "( [ eq : e_np_explicit])-([eq : e_np_explicit_res ] ) and discussion below ) , that the metal - semiconductor system is _ less _ nonlinear than the metal - liquid system .",
    "this is a direct result of the heat diffusion in the host , and more generally , of the spatially non - local nature of the thermal nonlinearity in the system , causing lower effective heating of the metal nanosphere .",
    "another striking difference between fig .",
    "[ fig : au_oil_example ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : au_algaas_example ] is that in the latter , neither the cubic nor the cubic - quintic fits provide a good match to the exact variations of the permittivity and field .",
    "as will be shown below , this can be traced to the relatively larger value of the ( relative ) change of the real part of the metal permittivity .",
    "we now replace the au spheres with ag spheres and set @xmath93 nm such that @xmath94 and  @xmath95  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ag_oil_example](a ) is reminiscent to those shown above , however , in contrast to previous cases , the real part of the permittivity of the ag particle decreases ( rather than increases ) .",
    "more importantly , although fig .",
    "[ fig : ag_oil_example](d ) shows results which look quantitatively similar to the cases of au particles , the reason for the decrease of scattering for the ag particles is different - it originates from the change of the real part of the permittivity rather than the change of the imaginary part , i.e. , the field decreases due to a shift _ away from resonance _ , rather than due to a decrease of the quality factor of the resonator .",
    "indeed , the change of the real part ( fig .  [ fig : ag_oil_example](b ) ) is far larger than the change of the imaginary part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ag_oil_example](c ) ) .",
    "this dominance also makes the cubic - quintic fit quite satisfactory , in contrast to what is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : au_algaas_example ] .",
    "this observation prompts us to predict the opposite behaviour , so far not observed experimentally . specifically ,",
    "if the illumination is initially non - resonant , the heat generation can cause the system to shift _ into _ resonance , hence , the quality factor and local field amplitude to increase .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ag_oil_example2 ] .",
    "peculiarly , this example shows a deviation from the perturbative description in ( a ) , yet , ( b)-(d ) are well described by a cubic - quintic nonlinearity .",

    "we note that all the cases studied here involved @xmath121 , leading typically to the `` thermal saturation '' described above - the temperature grows more slowly at high intensities compared to low intensities . in turn",
    ", this leads to a decrease of the internal and scattered fields with increasing intensity  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour was indeed observed in all experiments of nonlinear scattering from metal nanoparticles under cw illumination performed so far  @xcite .",
    "however , the ellipsometry data reveals narrow spectral regimes where @xmath122 , e.g. , for au for @xmath123 ( due to the effect of the fermi smearing on the interband transitions  @xcite ) .",
    "this regime is , however , out of the resonance band , hence , the response of the system is expected to be weak in this regime . for ag  @xcite , a much narrower regime in which @xmath122 around @xmath124 nm was identified .",
    "even then , the thermo - derivatives in this regime are much smaller than in the examples above . yet , although elusive , such a regime is clearly highly desirable for plasmonic applications , since it gives rise to higher quality factors and _ stronger _ fields .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this effect should not be confused with saturable absorption (= partial population inversion , thus , associated with a non - thermal electron distribution ) , which could explain the intriguing `` reverse saturable '' scattering observed in  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to write the temperature dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps_t_linear ] ) as the product of the intensity and the cubic nonlinear coefficient associated with the thermal effect , and similarly for the quintic effect etc .. however , strictly speaking , such as expansion  ( [ eq : eps_t_linear ] ) _ can not _ be regarded as an inherent material parameter , because although it involves the intrinsic material electromagnetic response of the metal , it also involves , as would happen for any structure , the size of the nanosphere , and the electromagnetic and thermal response of the host . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature - dependent term  ( [ eq : eps_t_linear ] ) can not be understood as an effective nonlinearity either , since such a quantity necessarily involves the fill factor , inter - particle interactions etc ..    thus , the correction to the permittivity , @xmath125 , or its leading order term @xmath126 , should be understood as a figure of merit ( fom ) for the nonlinear response .",
    "specifically , the values of nonlinear coefficients reported in  @xcite can not be compared to other reported values of intrinsic nonlinearity of metals .",
    "note that our fom , @xmath126 , is proportional to the absorption cross - section of the nanosphere or equivalently , to the joule number  @xcite .",
    "it , however , includes also information about the absolute temperature rise for a given incoming intensity and host by accounting for heat diffusion in the host .",
    "accordingly , while the conventional fom ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) and  @xcite ) is relevant globally for linear optics , in the context of intense illumination , it is useful only for ultrafast illumination where the thermal properties do not play an important role , i.e. , when the response is spatially - local . in all other cases , especially the many associated applications ,",
    "our fom should be used .",
    "specifically , our fom shows that the highest thermal nonlinearity will be obtained for a dilute host ( e.g. , gas , or even vacuum ) , due to its low thermal conductivity .",
    "the results of the current manuscript are specific to a few nm sphere .",
    "however , we believe that our claims apply also to larger spheres , as well as to particles of other shapes , with only quantitative differences associated with the non - uniformity of the field and temperature . the results presented above and the good match to experimental results  @xcite support the interpretation of the experimental results of nonlinear scattering of cw light from the small nanospheres as a thermal nonlinear effect",
    ". however , many effects which do not play an important role in the ultrafast case , may have a non - negligible contribution in the cw case ; these include specifically , stress / strain , partial population inversion due to interband transitions  @xcite , free - carrier generation , multi - photon absorption etc .. in that regard , our study identifies several easy measurements that may allow us to establish the dominance of the thermal effect over all the additional ones .",
    "first , we show that the variation of @xmath53 , which appears only in the thermo - optical nonlinearity studied here , may enable the isolation experimentally the role of the thermal effect .",
    "an attempt to do that was made in  @xcite , however , this study ignored various additional relevant factors like the size of the particles that affects the leading order solution @xmath98  ( [ eq : dt_lin ] ) .",
    "it also compared composites with different densities ( details not provided ) that could also affect the effective response due to the long range nature of the thermal interactions between adjacent nanospheres .",
    "these facts can explain the large discrepancy in  @xcite between the theoretical prediction ( based solely on the value of the thermal conductivity ) and the experimental observations .",
    "a more accurate match requires accounting for all the additional parameters , including @xmath116 which appears on the quintic order  ( [ eq : dt_ii_taylor_on ] ) , for size effects by relaxing the assumptions on field and temperature uniformity , as well as for the potential absorption in the host .",
    "alternatively , one has to compare the measurement of a composite to a full effective medium theory for a composite .",
    "second , the configuration described in fig .  [",
    "fig : ag_oil_example2 ] is related , again , with a unique signature of the thermal effect .",
    "however , we emphasize that there is still some uncertainty regarding the exact values of @xmath127 for ag , especially due possible differences of morphology of particles made with different methods ( see e.g. , discussion in  @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "although the most accessible experimental indication for nonlinear scattering is the far field intensity , there is growing interest in measuring temperature in the near field  @xcite .",
    "such measurements will give the ultimate evidence regarding the role of the thermal effect .",
    "the formulation , numerical results and analysis described in this manuscript will provide valuable predictions for such measurements .    in this study , we limited ourselves the thermal effects and modest temperature increases . beyond that range ,",
    "the thermo - derivatives are not necessarily constant , giving rise to further deviation from the perturbative description .",
    "in addition , other effects may become important for higher temperatures / intensities , e.g. , multi - photon absorption , and non - thermal effects  . in the presence of the latter",
    ", one would not be able to use the high temperature ellipsometry results of  @xcite which are relevant only for metals are at thermal equilibrium , i.e. , their electrons obey the fermi - dirac distribution . clearly , at even higher temperatures , the metal would undergo sintering and eventually melting , and the host may get damaged .    as a final statement , this study provides an important step towards the characterization of the effective response of arrays of particles , which can be regarded as thermo - optical metamaterials - artificial materials that change their electromagnetic properties under laser illumination due to temperature rise .",
    "these would have to be studied under proper effective medium theory and beyond the perturbative description , accounting not only for the electromagnetic interactions between the nanoparticles , but also for the thermal interaction between them .",
    "the latter is expected to have a far longer length scale .",
    "this fact , together with the use of an absorptive nonlinearity , may allow surpassing the limitations detailed in  @xcite for highly nonlinear metamaterials .",
