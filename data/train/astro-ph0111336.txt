    "deuterium measurements place fundamental constraints on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the amount of baryons in the universe , and the chemical evolution of galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "deuterium is thought to be formed by primordial bbn , and has subsequently been processed in stellar interiors .",
    "therefore , the abundance of d should decrease with time and local d / h measurements should provide lower limits to the primordial d abundance . by comparing local measurements with measurements obtained for distant intergalactic clouds toward quasars , a better picture of the chemical evolution of the galaxies can be drawn .",
    "a key step is to establish a robust set of measurements for environments within the galaxy .",
    "this has not yet been done , and the picture that now exists is complicated by several recent studies . @xcite",
    "obtained a nearly constant ratio of @xmath9 in the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , while other investigations @xcite suggest variations amongst the different sight lines probing gas beyond the lic .",
    "possible causes of d / h variations are numerous @xcite , but none have yet been definitely implicated in causing the observed variations .    the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) is capable of directly observing deuterium absorption in the lyman series lines ( except lyman-@xmath10 ) at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths shortward of 1200  .",
    "access to higher order lyman lines allows a larger variety of environments ( more distant , denser clouds ) to be observed than is possible with the _ hubble space telescope _ or imaps .",
    "therefore , _ fuse _ measurements are essential for a better description of the possible d / h variations that may occur within the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy .",
    "we present the first measurement of deuterium absorption toward the white dwarf wd0621@xmath0376 ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ) .",
    "the star is a hot ( @xmath13 k ) , metal - rich da white dwarf @xcite with a smooth stellar continuum .",
    "it lies at a photometric distance of @xmath14 pc @xcite . in agreement with the _ iue _ observations ,",
    "no absorption ( e.g. , @xmath15992.3 , 1084.9 ) is seen in the _ fuse _ spectrum ; therefore continuum placement for the observed lines in the _ fuse _ band is not affected adversely by the far - uv series .",
    "this article is part of a series dedicated to the first _ fuse _ measurements of deuterium along sight lines toward feige110 @xcite , wd2211@xmath0495 @xcite , hz43a @xcite , g191-b2b @xcite , bd+284211 @xcite , and wd1634@xmath0573 @xcite . @xcite",
    "present a synthesis of these results .",
    "_ fuse _ is a dedicated observatory providing access to the 9051187   wavelength range at high spectral resolution .",
    "the design and performance of the _ fuse _ spectrograph have been described by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "two sets of _ fuse _ observations of wd0621@xmath0376 were obtained in histogram accumulation mode : on december 6 , 2000 , 19 exposures totaling an exposure time of 8.3 ks were obtained through the large @xmath16 aperture ( lwrs ) , while on february 3 , 2001 , 21 exposures totaling 9.8 ks were obtained with the medium @xmath17 aperture ( mdrs ) .",
    "the data are archived in the multi - mission archive at the space telescope institute under the observation identifications p1041501 and p1041502 . to reduce the effects of detector fixed - pattern noise",
    ", the data were acquired using focal plane split motions , wherein subsequent exposures are placed at different locations on the detector .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of the observations this mode was not fully operational and caused misalignments of different channels during some exposures . for the lwrs observations ,",
    "8 exposures were lost in the sic2 channels . for the mdrs observations ,",
    "only the lif1 channels were properly aligned ; for lif2 , 9 exposures were lost ( for 7 exposures the detector was off ) ; for sic1 , 6 exposures were lost ; and for sic2 only two exposures were aligned .",
    "airglow emission lines were reduced along with the stellar spectra , but their intensities were minimized as most of exposures were obtained during orbital night ( except for two exposures for each observation ) .    standard processing with the current version of the calibration pipeline software ( calfuse v1.8.7 ) was used to extract and calibrate the spectra .",
    "this version of the pipeline does not yet correct for the astigmatism or flatfield , and therefore we required any absorption features to be present in at least two channels to be considered real .",
    "the extracted spectra associated with the separate exposures of a given observation were aligned by cross - correlating the positions of strong interstellar lines , co - added , and rebinned to a nominal spectral resolution of @xmath1@xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the interstellar lines were shifted to 0 @xmath2  in the laboratory rest frame ( note , however , that _ iue _ spectra gave a heliocentric velocity of @xmath20 @xmath2 , * ? ? ? * ) . including or removing the two daylight exposures in each observation",
    "did not change the strengths of the airglow lines , and therefore all the exposures were co - added to maximize the signal - to - noise levels ( s / n ) . to maintain an optimal spectral resolution and information on the fixed - pattern noise , neither the individual segments , nor the lwrs and mdrs observations were co - added together .",
    "we present reduced spectra for several different detector segments in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the data reveal numerous stellar and interstellar absorption lines .",
    "prominent interstellar lines are identified .",
    "we used two different methods to derive the column densities of the interstellar species observed toward wd0621@xmath0376 : ( 1 ) the apparent optical depth method ( aod , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to derive column densities and to check for unresolved saturated structures within the observed profiles .",
    "a direct integration of the apparent column density profiles , @xmath21 $ ] , over the velocity range yields the true total column density in cases where the absorption is weak ( @xmath22 ) or the lines are resolved .",
    "equivalent widths were directly measured by integrating the observed intensity .",
    "( 2 ) a profile fitting ( pf ) method using the code owens was also used to obtain the column densities of , , , and .",
    "the reader should refer to hbrard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a full description of the pf method , and we will concentrate on describing in details the aod results .",
    "the two approaches are different and complementary .",
    "some of the issues involved in using these two methods are discussed by @xcite . by using both approaches",
    ", we have a consistency check on the derived column densities and systematic errors associated with the measurements of each particular method .",
    "all methods are subject to a systematic uncertainty due to the possible presence of a broad component in the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) .",
    "several tests @xcite show however that the uncertainty due to this effect is negligible for weak metal lines of the type discussed in this paper .",
    "consequently , for the profile fitting method , the lsf was modeled with a single gaussian component .",
    "exemples of how the lsf handling in the profile fitting affects the column density results are discussed in   [ pf ] .",
    "we adopted wavelengths and oscillator strengths from the morton ( 2000 , private communication ) atomic data compilation .",
    "this compilation is similar to the @xcite compilation with a few minor updates to the atomic parameters for lines of interest in this study .",
    "the stellar continuum was simple enough near the , , , , , , , , and features to be fitted with low - order ( @xmath23 ) legendre polynomials .",
    "equivalent widths and apparent column densities are summarized in table  [ t1 ] , where lower limits indicate that the line contains some unresolved , saturated absorption that can not be reliably estimated with the existing data .",
    "comparisons of the data from multiple channels were used to check for fixed - pattern noise and systematic continuum placement problems . for the measurements",
    "the following segments were used : sic1b ( 905992  ) ; sic2a ( 9171005  ) ; sic1a ( 10031091  ) ; lif1a ( 9871082  ) ; lif1b ( 10941187  ) ; lif2a ( 10871182  ) .",
    "the last column in table  [ t1 ] indicates which segments were used to study each line . in this column",
    ", the absence of a segment indicates that there may be a detector defect at this wavelength ( e.g. , sic2a has more bad pixels than sic1b , especially in the range 960965   near the lines ) .",
    "although the measurements were cross - checked and were in agreement in the different segments indicated in table  [ t1 ] , we adopted the values of equivalent width and apparent column density from the segments having the best quality data .",
    "exceptions are the sic2a lwrs and sic1b lwrs and mdrs channels that have comparable quality data ; the values for lines measured on these segments were averaged ( all the measured values were within the estimated @xmath24 errors of the individual measurements ) .    to check if the lines contain some unresolved saturated structure , the apparent column density profiles of two or more lines of a given species with different values of @xmath25 were directly compared ( and ) .",
    "the transitions at 963.99 and 965.05   are affected by an unknown source of noise , and this results in a column density that can not be reconcilied with the values derived from other lines ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is unlikely to arise from the adopted oscillator strengths , as studies of other sight lines do not show any particular problem for these transitions .",
    "since we have information from different channels ( see last column in table  [ t1 ] ) , fixed - pattern noise also seems unlikely .",
    "contamination by unidentified photospheric stellar lines is the most likely source of confusion since this star is metal rich .",
    "these two lines were removed from the analysis . of the remaining lines ,",
    "only @xmath261134.98 suffers from weak saturation effects .",
    "similar comparisons were made for , and the transitions at 948.686 , 971.738 and 1039.230   contain unresolved saturated structures ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "we note that , while the total column densities of all the unsaturated lines of and agree remarkably well within the @xmath24 errors , the strongest @xmath26@xmath26953.655 , 1134.415 and @xmath26@xmath26936.630 , 976.448 lines yield the lowest apparent column densities , indicating some weak saturation effects might be present . for the other species ,",
    "assuming they follow a similar curve of growth , only and are likely to be influenced strongly by saturation effects .    both and are blended with their respective stellar features .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a stellar model ( @xmath27 k ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 , preliminary results from chayer et al . , in preparation ) that estimates the stellar contribution ( @xmath1@xmath31 for , @xmath1@xmath32 for ) .",
    "the stellar model was aligned to the observed stellar lines , and an offset of @xmath33 @xmath2  was found with respect to the interstellar lines .",
    "suffers from blending with interstellar @xmath26989.87 absorption , which is clearly visible in figure  [ fig2 ] , but the combination of relatively low spectral resolution and the proximity of the stellar feature did not allow us to model this line .",
    "we examined the _ iue _ spectrum of wd0621@xmath0376 to check for absorption at longer wavelengths , but its poor quality did not shed any light on the amount of along this sight line .",
    "therefore , the derived equivalent width of must be considered an upper limit .",
    "the spectra also show the detection of a very weak feature at 1144.938  .",
    "though its measurement remains uncertain , its identification is unambiguous as the radial velocity of this feature is in agreement with the velocities of the lines in the lif1b and lif2a segments .",
    "the @xmath34 upper limits for the equivalent widths in table  [ t1 ] are defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath5 is the inverse of continuum s / n ratio and @xmath36  , which is approximately the average fwhm obtained from the resolved features .",
    "the corresponding @xmath34 upper limits on the column density are obtained from the corresponding equivalent width limits and the assumption of a linear curve of growth .",
    "lyman-@xmath37 is well detected in the _ fuse _ spectra of wd0621@xmath0376 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows some evidence for tentative detections of @xmath26972 and @xmath26949 .",
    "polynomial fits to the continua are shown for different segments along with their respective normalized profiles with optimized gaussian fits ( see below ) . except for segment sic2a ,",
    "all the measurements for @xmath15972 and 949 yield detections with less than @xmath34 significance ( see table  [ t2 ] ) . for segment sic2a ,",
    "both the continuum placement and the line detection remain very uncertain and fixed - pattern noise may contaminate this feature .",
    "the measurements of these lines and the @xmath34 upper limits on @xmath38 and @xmath39 were derived following the same methods described in   [ ism ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the lyman-@xmath37 spectra in the different segments .",
    "we note that the airglow is relatively strong and broad ( @xmath1100 @xmath2 ) in the lwrs data .",

    "observations : the top panel of figure  [ fig5 ] shows the model overplotted on the data .",
    "while figure  [ fig5 ] shows a reasonable stellar model , there are still some problems as some portions of the spectrum are not so well reproduced by the stellar model . to estimate the contribution from the feature , the normalized profile ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig5 ] )",

    "this approach yields a logarithmic apparent column density of @xmath41 dex ( 1@xmath5 ) . considering other segments",
    "gives similar results , but these are more uncertain as the airglow is stronger .",
    "the above estimates of @xmath7 ) agree within their 1@xmath5 errors , though the difference in the absolute values shows some uncertainties caused by the continuum placement .",
    "we adopt @xmath39(@xmath42 dex ( 2@xmath5 ) , obtained by doing a weighted mean of the apparent column densities derived using the two different continuum placements .",
    "table  [ t3 ] summarizes the definitive results for the different ions ( for and , the values are weighted means of the values listed in table  [ t1 ] )    as discussed above , the s / n levels for the higher lyman series were not high enough to make precise estimates of @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , their @xmath34 upper limits do not suggest that the lyman-@xmath37 line is strongly saturated , if at all . comparing the apparent optical depths of lyman-@xmath37 with the unsaturated and lines ( see figure  [ fig6 ] )",
    "indicates that the lyman-@xmath37 optical depths for the two continuum placements are only as strong as the strongest and features , suggesting that the line might not be entirely resolved ( see   [ ism ] )",
    ". however , saturation corrections should be small ( @xmath43 dex according to the and lines ) and are less than the 2@xmath5 error bars on the measurement .",
    "in addition to estimating column densities using the apparent optical depth method , two independent profile fitting analyses using voigt profiles and using the information simultaneously from all the windows were performed , leading to two sets of results , pf1 and pf2 . in pf1 ,",
    "the profile fitting code owens was used to fit the data in 32 spectral windows , including all available unsaturated lines from , , and ( i.e. , @xmath261134.980 , @xmath26@xmath26948.686 , 971.738 and 1039.230 were excluded ) . in pf2 , a total of 24 windows were used including lines from , , and .",

    "apart from the different number of windows used , the differences in the results arise from the strategies adopted to deal with the widths of the lsf .",
    "the lsfs are not yet well characterized and are known to vary from one segment to another . in pf1 the lsf widths of about 60% of the windows were fixed to a pre - defined value ( ranging from 8.7 to 12 pixels , depending on the window ) , while in pf2 the lsf widths were free to vary , with the constraint that they remain within plausible values ( in the accepted fits the maximum fwhm was 15 pixels and the minimum was 6 pixels).6.7 and @xmath16.2 m  per pixel for lif and sic channels , respectively . ]",
    "the largest differences , found for the column densities , are due to the fact that in pf2 high column density values  implying saturation of some of the fitted lines ",
    "were permitted by the adoption of broader lsfs .",
    "the top and middle panels of figure  [ fig7 ] show the best fits to the lyman-@xmath37 line in the lif1a mdrs channel , as obtained by pf1 ( @xmath39(@xmath44 dex ) and pf2 ( @xmath39(@xmath45 dex ) , respectively . as expected , there is no difference in the fitted profiles , but the difference in the adopted fit parameters can be seen in the profiles plotted before convolution with the lsf .",
    "the unconvolved profile is slightly narrower ( and deeper ) in pf1 than in pf2 because of a slightly lower @xmath46-value ( 7.1 vs 8.9 @xmath2 ) required to compensate for a slightly higher lsf width ( 10.5 vs 9.4 pixels in the lif1a mdrs data ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig7 ] shows a fit performed with owens using the pf2 method but fixing the column density to the best value ( @xmath39(@xmath47 dex ) derived in   [ deut ] using the aod method .",
    "in this case , the unconvolved profile is shallower than the other two , but the convolved profile is not , because this is compensated by a narrow lsf ( 8 pixels ) . for the aod value",
    "the optical depth of the lyman-@xmath37 line is smaller than 1 .",
    "for the two best fits in pf1 and pf2 , the lyman-@xmath37 line is slightly saturated , explaining why the column density results obtained by the two profile fitting studies are higher than those obtained by the aod method .",
    "the results obtained by the three independent investigations are shown in table  [ t3 ] .",
