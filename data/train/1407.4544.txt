    "the role of collisions between the dense clouds of gas in the interstellar medium has flitted on the outside of mainstream star formation theories for over three decades ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while it is not disputed that such events occur , it has been hard to pin down their frequency and what impact these encounters have on their host galaxy s star formation rate .",
    "these problems stem from the difficulty in observing both the collision process itself and its most likely products , the high mass stars .",
    "the formation process involving the largest members of the stellar population remains one of diverse theoretical candidates . while low mass stars can form via accreting gas onto a gravitationally collapsed core ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this process most likely fails in the case of a massive star both by the time - scales involved to accrete sufficient mass and by the radiation pressure and ionisation that the growing core would produce , thereby stopping the accretion before a large enough object is formed . to counter these problems , the proposed models either modify the physical conditions of the accretion via such mechanisms as the dust content @xcite , wind blown cavities @xcite and accretion disks @xcite or opt for later evolution with physical collisions between low - mass stars @xcite . in their paper , @xcite",
    "propose that such problems can be avoided if the collapsed core is turbulent and the surface density is sufficiently high with @xmath6g@xmath2 needed for a @xmath7m@xmath5 . in such cases ,",
    "the ram pressure associated with accretion exceeds the radiation pressure .",
    "the creation of the higher surface densities required by @xcite is a point in favour for cloud - cloud collisions . in this process ,",
    "interstellar clouds moving at supersonic velocities collide and produce a shock wave at the collision interface . where the shock compresses the cloud gas , the densities rise and clumps in the post - shocked gas collapse under the effect of the enhanced self - gravity ( e.g * ?",
    "since clouds moving at the required supersonic velocities are readily observed @xcite and both the interstellar medium and the star forming giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are known to be turbulent @xcite , this dynamic picture of triggered core formation has many points in its favour compared to a quasi - static viewpoint .",
    "examples of probable cloud - cloud collisions are steadily increasing .",
    "in such cases , observations identify two distinct velocity components in the gas , belonging to the two clouds undergoing a collision .",
    "early observations of this phenomenon include @xcite who identified two components in the co spectra of molecular cloud ngc 133 which they propose is the cause of the chain of newly formed stars within the cloud , and later in lkh@xmath8198 , a molecular cloud containing herbig be / ae stars .",
    "@xcite also found two velocity components in dr21/w75 ; a high - mass star forming region and @xcite accounts the star formation and elongated shape of the unbound high altitude cloud gr110 - 13 to compression during a cloud collision .",
    "more recent observations include the two super star clusters , westerland2 and ngc3603 .",
    "super star clusters are tightly packed stellar groups with radii @xmath9pc and masses @xmath10m@xmath5",
    "that contain a large number of massive stars .",
    "their formation has historically perplexed researchers due to the problem of creating such a high mass cluster if the star formation efficiency inside the gmc is low . the first cluster to be identified as a possible collision object was westerland2 which was observed by @xcite and @xcite and found to have two associated clouds with relative velocity of 20km / s .",
    "the authors propose that the resulting shock between the clouds compressed the gas to produce the massive star cluster .",
    "ohama et al . , in prep . later identified two giant molecular clouds associated with ngc3603 , prompting suggestions that it could have a similar formation mechanism .",
    "a third recent cloud collision candidate was found in observations of the galactic hii region trifid nebula , m20 , performed by @xcite .",
    "they identified two clouds with masses @xmath11m@xmath5 and relative velocity @xmath12km / s moving towards a central o star in m20 and suggest this object was created during the clouds collision .",
    "notably , the relative velocities observed in these three events are too high for the clouds to be gravitationally bound to one another , supporting the idea that these are examples of accidental collisions .    despite the increasing frequency of observations ,",
    "the total number of cloud collision candidates remains small , suggesting that such triggered star formation is indeed a minor addition to the galaxy s total star formation rate .",
    "however , new observations using nanten2/nanten 4 m sub - mm / mm telescope conversely suggest that such events have previously been miss - classified and are significantly more numerous that previously thought .",
    "torii et al . , in prep . argues that the ring structure seen in the galactic hii region , rcw120 , is a classic example of what is expected in a cloud collision .",
    "rcw120 is one of the spitzer bubbles @xcite , a collection of 322 objects , 52 of which show a similar ring morphology .",
    "this distinctive shape has previously been accounted for by the wind - blown model @xcite , whereby stellar winds from central high mass star causes gas to be swept into a spherical shell .",
    "however , bubbles such as rcw120 display partial arcs , rather than complete rings with high dust concentration on the outer edge of the ring , rather than the interior .",
    "the star formation is also off - center , pointing towards a bow shock rather than formation via internal expansion .",
    "the idea that such a morphology is the product of cloud collisions is further supported by theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite performed two dimensional simulations of a head - on collision between non - identical clouds .",
    "they found that the larger cloud was disrupted by the resulting bow - shock which in turn , compressed the smaller cloud .",
    "this compression caused the post - shock gas in the smaller cloud to become gravitationally unstable , even in the case where the cloud was initially below its jeans mass .",
    "the geometric structure of the collision shows the same ring - like morphology as seen in the spitzer bubbles , with dense cores for the expected star formation forming in the compressed shock , not in the center of the ring .",
    "@xcite performed a similar simulation where they looked at the stability of the post - collision bow - shock in three dimensional simulations . while initially supported by turbulence , shocks within the bow - shock cause it to be susceptible to a number of hydrodynamic instabilities including the kelvin - helmholtz instability between shearing fluids , the rayleigh - taylor buoyancy instability and the thin shell instability that occurs when a shocked shell of gas becomes unstable to small perturbations , developing expanding ripples .",
    "of these three , the thin shell instability was deemed the most important for the bow - shock evolution , causing it to bend at the apex and extend along the collision axis in a filament that fragments to form cores .",
    "the creation of such a structure was proposed to be the origin for filament - type clouds , such as the orion molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite also note the importance of the relative collision speed between the clouds , finding that a relative velocity of @xmath13km / s produced cores with masses between @xmath14m@xmath5 in clouds of mass @xmath15m@xmath5 and @xmath16m@xmath5 whereas a lower velocity of @xmath17km / s failed to produce any cores .",
    "this find was further supported by colliding flow simulations of magnetised non - homogeneous gas by @xcite .",
    "they found the mass of the generated core depended both on this collision velocity and the strength of the initial magnetic field .    on a larger scale ,",
    "@xcite have tackled the problem of how common accidental collisions between clouds are likely to be .",
    "they find that in a simulation of a milky way - type disk , multiple collisions can occur per orbital period , with a rate of approximately 5 per orbit .",
    "this agrees with analytical calculations performed by @xcite who argues that if the rate of collisions is enough to achieve multiple encounters per orbital period then cloud collisions could drive the star formation rate in the galaxy , producing the empirical kennicutt - schmidt relation between gas surface density and star formation rate @xcite .    in this paper , we examine the formation of dense , star - forming cores in a head - on cloud cloud collision between non - identical clouds and investigate the impact of turbulence and collision speed on the properties and evolution of these cores .",

    "4 explored the collision speed and in section ",
    "5 we present our conclusions .",
    "our simulations were run with _ enzo _ ; a three - dimensional hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement code @xcite .",
    "we used a boxsize of side @xmath18pc with a top level root grid size of @xmath19 and an additional two levels of refinement , giving a limiting resolution ( smallest cell size ) of @xmath0pc .",
    "the refinement criteria was based on baryon mass and on the resolution of the jeans length , which must be refined by at least four cells as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics were evolved over time using a three - dimensional implementation of the _ zeus _ astrophysical code @xcite . to handle shocks , _ zeus _ uses an artificial viscosity where the associated variable , the quadratic artificial viscosity term , set to @xmath20 ( the default value ) .",
    "gas cools radiatively down to @xmath12k using a one - dimensional cooling table created using the cloudy cooling code @xcite where solar metallicity and a density of 100@xmath2 was assumed . for the densities achieved in our simulation , the cooling function remains relatively constant , allowing us to use this simplification .    in order to prevent gas undergoing unrefined collapse on the finest grid level",
    ", we impose a pressure floor . in a collapsing region where the jeans length can no longer be refined by the desired four cells ,",
    "the pressure is increased so that the gas follows a polytrope with an adiabatic index @xmath21 .",
    "this polytrope is stable and stops the collapse at a finite density , preventing single cells getting impossibly dense compared to their surroundings as gravitationally unstable gas flows towards their center .",
    "while the truelove limit of four cells per jeans length is designed to prevent spurious fragmentation , it may not be sufficient to resolve the turbulence on the smallest scales . in simulations performed by @xcite ,",
    "30 cells per jeans length were required to converge the values of the turbulent energy . in our current simulations",
    ", this cell number corresponds to a physical length greater than our core size .",
    "we therefore note that while the overall fragmentation of the gas into star - forming regions is correctly followed , the velocity dispersion within these cores is unlikely to have reached a converged value .",
    "however , since the primary questions in this paper focus on the formation of potential star forming sites , this limit is sufficient to assess the impact of the cloud collision . to confirm this , in section  [ sec :",
    "highres ] we compare our results with a simulation performed at twice the resolution .",
    "a related point with the above is the impact of the pressure floor on the dense cores .",
    "the increased pressure at our maximum refinement prevents unresolved collapse , but also impacts the evolution of the internal core properties .",
    "an alternative technique would have been to utilise sink particles which estimate an accretion rate according to the surrounding density and temperature when the gas reaches a high density and meets additional criteria that identify bound and collapsing regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however due to where our resolution becomes limited and the difficulty with destroying a sink , we chose to keep the cores as pressure supported gas , but note this introduces an error in their internal values .",
    "star - forming cores are identified in the simulation via a constant density contour finding algorithm @xcite . in the majority of our results , this density threshold is set to @xmath22 , although we also compare the evolution in core number with core selection at @xmath23 and @xmath24 in section[sec : core_number ] . in comparison ,",
    "the average gmc density is observed to be @xmath25@xmath26 while star formation is seen to occur at @xmath27@xmath28 ( observations by @xcite and theoretical estimate from @xcite ) .",
    "therefore within these cores , gravity is likely to dominate over other physical processes to result in star formation .    in order to analyse the evolution of the core properties",
    ", we track their motion over the time of the simulation .",
    "this process is performed in a similar manner to the cloud tracking scheme presented in @xcite and works as follows :    1 .",
    "data outputs are taken at 0.1myr intervals during the simulation and cores are identified via the above criteria in all outputs .",
    "the position of each core is predicted in the next time step via @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the core position at time @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the core position and velocity one output earlier and @xmath34 is the time passed between outputs , 0.1myr .",
    "a spherical volume of radius @xmath35 is searched around each predicted position for cores present in the time , t output .",
    "the closest core in that region is assumed to be the same core 0.1myr later .",
    "if no cores are found , the core is assumed to have dissipated or merged with another core .",
    "4 .   in the case of two cores",
    "being assigned to the same present - time core , the closest one is tracked .",
    "an example of the core tracking is shown for three times at 0.1myr intervals in figure  [ fig : trace ] .",
    "the surface density of a 4pc section of the shock front during a collision with a relative velocity of 5km / s is imaged with the core positions and their assigned number overlaid . by eye it is possible to confirm that cores found in equivalent positions as the shock progresses maintain the same tracking number .",
    ".,width=226 ]    the simulation initial conditions consist of two clouds of unequal masses whose boundaries are separated by approximately 1.2pc as shown in figure  [ fig : ics ] .",
    "the density distribution of each cloud takes the form of a bonner - ebert sphere @xcite ; a hydrostatic isothermal self - gravitating gas sphere that is confined by its external pressure .",
    "the maximum mass such a sphere can have and remain stable is given by :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath38 is a constant , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 : boltzmann constant ) is the external gas pressure and g is the gravitational constant . both the simulated clouds fulfil this stability requirement , having masses of @xmath41m@xmath5 and @xmath42m@xmath5 , both equivalent to @xmath43m@xmath44 at 120k and 240k respectively .",
    "their properties are detailed more fully in table[table : ics ] .",
    "once cooling begins , the cloud becomes unstable and without additional support , will start to collapse .",
    "this profile was primarily chosen because the initial stability is appealing when considering the impact of outside effects .",
    "however , molecular clouds have also been observed to show a bonner - ebert density profile in the work of @xcite .",
    "other clouds , meanwhile , have a higher mass than their bonner - ebert mass but despite this are not in free - fall collapse , due to additional support from internal turbulent motions .",
    "this allows @xmath37 in the above equation to be switched for the effective sound speed that also including a contribution from the velocity dispersion .",
    "compared to observed gmcs , the cloud mass we have selected is small .",
    "typical clouds within the milky way have masses @xmath45 @xcite , a factor of 10 above our chosen sizes . the results from collisions between larger clouds will be explored in subsequent papers , but selecting a smaller cloud at this stage allows a simpler study of the shock front evolution at high resolutions .

    "the core radius is defined from the core volume , @xmath46 , as @xmath47 .",
    "the virial parameter , @xmath48 , is a measure of the ratio of the kinetic and potential energy for a spherical object , defined by :    @xmath49    with @xmath50 , the 1d velocity dispersion of the core , including the sound speed : @xmath51 .",
    "a value @xmath52 implies the core is virialised with the total kinetic energy of the cloud equalling half its gravitational .",
    "a gravitationally bound core should correspond to an @xmath53 .    comparing the core properties across the three different collisional velocities ,",
    "the effect of the shock wave s duration inside the cloud is once again apparent ; the slower the collision , the longer the gas spends inside the shock front , allowing a higher mass core to be formed .",
    "so while the number of cores increases with higher collision speed , the core mass obtained is related to the length of time the shock remains inside the cloud .",
    "this results in the most massive core forming in the 3cc simulation while the 10cc cores remain small , despite their numerously seen in figure  [ fig : clumpnum ] .",
    "the average density of the 10cc cores hovers at our threshold definition around @xmath27@xmath54 with the average core accretion rate over a factor of 10 lower than in the 3cc and 5cc case due to the fast exit of the shock front .",
    "this result suggests that maximum core size is determined by accretion , not by the initial fragmentation .",
    "we will revisit this topic in section  [ sec : core_growth ] .",
    "cores are typically unbound , with only the largest core in simulation 3cc and 5cc obtaining an @xmath48 close to the threshold for gravitational binding .",
    "in fact , a more accurate calculation of this property reveals both those cores are bound , but the rest remain unbound .",
    "this is reflected in their mass , with the bound cores reaching a mass several times larger than the next biggest candidate through a runaway growth .",
    "this mass increase will also be explored in section  [ sec : core_growth ] .",
    "the cores continue to grow past the time shown in the tables , but the unbound cores ultimately begin to lose mass once the shock has passed and dissipate as shown in the core number plots in figure  [ fig : clumpnum ] .",
    "the number of unbound cores makes it possible that only a single object in these small clouds will survive to collapse and form a massive star or super star cluster .",
    "the core masses can be explored by looking at the cumulative mass distribution ( cmd ) shown in figure  [ fig : cmf ] . here , we restrict the cores plotted to those only containing a minimum of 27 cells ( approximately 3 cells in each dimension ) , to ensure the best resolution . due to the size of the cores formed in the 10cc case ,",

    "simulations of the collapse of a single isothermal cloud performed by @xcite also found agreement with @xmath65 for cores formed in their fragmented gas , while a comparison of clouds fragmenting with different initial density profiles by @xcite likewise found a salpeter consistent value of @xmath72 for all models .",
    "these similarities suggest that triggered core formation should take a similar form to more quiescent core creation .",
    "however , the time - scale is liable to be significantly shorter since even in the absence of turbulence , the free - fall time of the clouds is longer than their collisional interaction .",
    "this potentially produces a different imf , as the fast - forming cores may be able to gain a higher mass before feedback effects stunt their growth .      from the point of star formation",
    ", the most interesting structures to develop will be the gravitationally bound cores .",
    "these objects are the ones that are the most likely to collapse and form stars . as shown in the previous sections , despite many cores being produced in the collision , only a single bound core is formed in the 3cc and 5cc runs .",
    "due to the collision process being short in the 10km / s case , this run does not form any bound cores .",
    "a bound core can potentially form in two ways : it can collapse directly from shocked gas to form a sufficiently dense structure that its potential energy already exceeds its kinetic .",
    "alternatively , it can begin life as a unbound core and gather mass via accretion of the surrounding diffuse gas or through a merger with another core .",

    "since no bound core is formed in the 10cc case , the mass evolution of the largest formed core is plotted .",
    "as this is unlikely to collapse , we do not plot the supply rate in this case .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clumpnum ] , the first cores to form during the collision are low density , with the high density cores only appearing once the gas has spent time in the shock front .",
    "this suggests that cores do not initially form bound , but increase their mass over time .",
    "what can not be seen so easily from figure  [ fig : clumpnum ] , is whether this mass gain occurs through mergers or accretion .        in the 3km",
    "/ s simulation , the core growth is predominantly by accretion .",
    "it surpasses the effective jeans mass at @xmath81 and grows to a mass of 700m@xmath5 .",
    "the same is almost true for the bound core in the 5km / s simulation .",
    "growth is predominantly by accretion , yet a jump can be seen between @xmath82 that represents a merger scenario .",
    "it is therefore likely that cores grow by both accretion and mergers with other neighbouring cores , with accretion playing the most dominant role . in the 10km / s",
    "simulation , the core growth is insufficient to be gravitationally bound before @xmath83 , the time for the shock wave to propagate through _ cloud 1_. the accretion rate can initially explain the early core growth until @xmath84 , after which the core struggles to gain mass .",
    "this may be due to the exit of the shock from the core s region , which causes the hydrodynamic flow around the low mass core to disrupt it .    in reality",
    ", the maximum mass of the star forming from a gas core will be limited by the radiative heating from the forming stellar object .",
    "once the star has formed , bondi - hoyle accretion ( as plotted by our blue dashed line in figure  [ fig : bm ] ) is expected to only be efficient up to masses of 10m@xmath5 . from figure",
    "[ fig : bm ] , the bound cores in the 3cc and 5cc simulations reach their jeans mass at approximately @xmath85m@xmath5 and @xmath86m@xmath5 respectively . if stars are formed at this point , @xmath87m@xmath5 stars will be created , allowing for 50% of the core s gas to escape as outflows as suggested by the analytical estimates of @xcite and the simulation comparisons of @xcite .    however",
    ", if the cores are prevented from collapsing ( for instance by magnetic fields or turbulence unresolved in our simulation ) then the core may continue to follow the black line in figure  [ fig : bm ] before forming a star .",
    "in this situation , the core will only collapse to form a massive star if the ram pressure from the infalling gas can exceed that of the outward radiation pressure . using dimensional arguments ,",
    "@xcite argue that the rate of gas flow during the collapse into a star should be given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the instantaneous stellar mass . using this",
    ", we can argue that @xmath89 should be either half the core s mass or the effective jeans mass ( since gas mass below this value will not collapse ) , whichever is larger .",
    "this gives the rate of gas feeding the new star as @xmath90 , which we plot as the pink dashed line in figure  [ fig : bm ] , with the axis shown on the right .",
    "if the core is able to grow to 200m@xmath5 ( @xmath91m@xmath5 ) , then the supply rate will be @xmath92m@xmath5 yr@xmath93 , a value very close to the @xmath94m@xmath5 yr@xmath93 rate that @xcite estimate is required to form a 100m@xmath5 star .",
    "to assess how our results are affected by resolution , we reran the 5km / s relative velocity collision case with a limiting resolution of 0.03pc , increasing the resolution from our model in section  [ sec : results ] by a factor of 2 .",

    "this added bonus , however , only has a small benefit to the higher mass cores who appear at about the same time in both the high and low resolution runs at @xmath96 .",
    "1myr after the shock exits _ cloud 2 _ ( the cut - off point for the core number evolution plot ) , both the 5cc and 5cchr have formed 1 bound core , with this number increasing to 3 bound cores for 5cchr 0.5myr later .",

    "overall , the evolution of the higher resolution case is extremely close to that of its low resolution counterpart . the same overall quantity of dense gas is formed in the shock which translates to a similar number of high density and bound cores .",

    "the limiting resolution was 0.06pc , with one additional run performed at 0.03pc .",
    "we compared the effect of collisional speed on the core formation and examined the development of bound cores formed during the impact .    in all cases",
    ", the collision between the two clouds produces a shocked disc of gas where the clouds surfaces meet . due to the size difference between the two clouds ,",
    "the shock front becomes oblique as the clouds merge , pressing down on the shocked disc to form a crescent structure that is commonly observed in observations of suspected cloud - cloud collision events @xcite .    without turbulence , the smaller cloud",
    "is then compressed by its own gravity and the oblique shock , creating a single core . when turbulence is added , the shock front is comprised of filaments which lie at a range of angles to the propagating wave .",
    "these form thin shell instabilities , producing ripples that ultimately fragment into multiple cores .",
    "the number of these cores produced is proportional to the relative collision speed between the clouds . a faster collision forms cores more quickly and in greater numbers .",
    "however , the subsequent growth of these cores is controlled by how long they remain in the high density shock front .",
    "while core mergers can play a role in increasing core mass , the majority of the mass is gained via accretion .",
    "this happens most efficiently while the background density is high ; that is , while the core is inside the shocked disc .",
    "if the shock moves too fast , the cores exit the disc before they have had enough time to gain sufficient mass to become bound .",

    "a similar result was also found in orion b by @xcite .",
    "this evolution in the pdf is intricately linked with the production of turbulence in the clouds . as the shock front forms between the clouds , compressive turbulence modes are formed which increase the star formation efficiency and lead to the pdf tail .",
    "the cumulative mass distribution for the cores fit a power law with @xmath4 ( from equation  [ eq : cmd ] ) , in good agreement with observed cores inside gmcs .",
    "this suggests that cores formed in cloud collisions may resemble those in quiescent star formation , although the increased density of the shocked disc would be expected to increase both initial core size and accretion speed .",
    "indeed , if allowed to collapse without colliding , our clouds only form a small number of low density ( @xmath95g@xmath2 ) cores and do not produce objects close to the observed density of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the fact we produce substantially more massive cores in the collision than are formed through gravitational collapse alone is an indication that this process may be important for massive star formation .",
    "however , since accretion is the dominant forms of core growth in our colliding clouds , the resulting stars are unlikely to exceed 10m@xmath5 .",
    "two possible effects may change this result .",
    "the first is the size of our clouds , which are at the lower end of the observed gmc mass distribution .",
    "a collision between larger clouds or ones with initially higher densities may result in more massive fragmentation , producing larger cores prior to accretion .",
    "the second possibility is that cores are prevented from collapse by magnetic fields or turbulence that we are not resolving at our current resolution .",
    "this would permit the cores to grow via accretion before radiation from the forming star cuts the gas flow .",
    "we will consider these effects in later work .",
    "the authors would like to thank yasuo fukui for many helpful discussions about this work , the yt development team @xcite for support during the analysis of these simulations and their anonymous referee for an extremely helpful report .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on the cray xt4 and cray xc30 at the center for computational astrophysics ( cfca ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "ejt is funded by the mext grant for the tenure track system .",
