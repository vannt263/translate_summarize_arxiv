    "the interest to integrable continuous spin chains starts from @xcite , where the isotropic landau - lifshitz equation was considered as a spin equation of motion , soliton and periodic solutions were obtained by the method of traveling wave . besides numerical investigations of soliton - soliton scattering and stability of soliton solutions in @xcite ,",
    "the inverse scattering method was applied to the continuous heisenberg spin chain in @xcite .",
    "all the mentioned papers deal with su(2 ) spin chain , and the landau - lifshitz equation serves as an equation of motion .",
    "a generalization to su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg spin chain ( hamiltonian with bilinear exchange only ) derived from the vector nonlinear schdinger equation was presented in @xcite . in @xcite the integrable su(3 )",
    "spin chain with the most general hamiltonian was introduced as a system with the lax - pair representation , and shown to be gauge equivalent to a set of nonlinear schdinger - type equations .",
    "separation of variables for the classical integrable sl(3 ) magnetic chain was developed in @xcite . in @xcite the isotropic su(3 ) landau - lifshitz equation together with two- and three - component nonlinear schdinger - type equations were constructed by the orbit method . in @xcite the isotropic su(3 )",
    "landau - lifshitz equation is derived as a continuum limit of the quantum spin-1 lattice system ; this and a more general equations were constructed by means of the orbit method .",
    "the latter generalization of the landau - lifshitz equation , obtained over a generic coadjoint orbit of su(3 ) , is similar to the equation of motion for the su(3 ) spin chain with the most general hamiltonian from @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply sklyanin s separation of variables to the isotropic su(3 ) landau - lifshitz equation over a generic orbit .",
    "in contrast to the classical integrable sl(3 ) magnetic chain from @xcite , whose phase space is endowed with a quadratic poisson bracket and the monodromy matrix serves as an @xmath1-operator , we consider the system whose dynamic variables describe the mean fields of magnetic and quadrupole moments and phase space is endowed with a lie - poisson bracket .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain similar expressions for variables of separation",
    ". then we proceed to finite - gap integration of the isotropic su(3 ) landau - lifshitz equation . according to @xcite",
    "a half of variables of separation serve as poles of the baker - akhiezer function . for the system over a generic orbit",
    "the number of these poles exceeds the genus of the spectral curve by two , so integration leads to inversion of an extended abel - jacobi map by means of generalized @xmath2-functions @xcite .",
    "the similar situation is considered in @xcite .",
    "we focus on the simplest one - gap case with an elliptic spectral curve , and express abelian integrals in terms of the weierstrass elliptic function .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we describe quantum and classical models of su(3 ) spin-1 chain .",
    "the quantum spin operators are represented over the 3-dimensional space of irreducible representation of the group su(2 ) .",
    "we construct quadrupole operators from the tensor operators of weight 2 .",
    "these operators allow to linearize the system with the bilinear - biquadratic exchange hamiltonian . by the mean field approximation",
    "we take the continuum limit and obtain a dynamical system coinciding with the one constructed over a degenerate coadjoint orbit of su(3 ) . at the same time",
    "another dynamical system is constructed over a generic coadjoint orbit of su(3 ) . for the latter system in section 3",
    "we develop the scheme of separation of variables in sklyanin s manner , and prove that variables of separation are quasi - canonical .",
    "we solve the problem of computing dynamic variables from the variables of separation .",
    "then we perform integration for the one - gap case in terms of the weierstrass elliptic function .",
    "suppose we have a lattice of atoms of spin 1 .",
    "every atom is modeled by a tuple of spin and quadrupole operators .",
    "in contrast to the well - known heisenberg model considering two spin projections and representing spin operators by the pauli matrices , we take into account all three projections of the spin momentum and represent spin operators over the 3-dimensional space : @xmath3 the corresponding matrix algebra @xmath4 is not exhausted by these three operators , so we add six operators more .",
    "we choose the following operators and call them quadrupole : @xmath5    introducing the quadrupole operators we have an opportunity to take into account the second order of exchange interaction and use the bilinear - biquadratic exchange hamiltonian , easily reduced to a bilinear form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are interaction constants , @xmath0 runs over all @xmath9 sites of the lattice and @xmath10 runs over the nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "we use the notation : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where every entry @xmath19 is a tensor product over all sites of @xmath20 identity operators @xmath21 and the operator @xmath22 at the @xmath0th position .",
    "next , we apply the mean field approximation under the broken symmetry stimulated by an external magnetic field .",
    "this guarantees nonzero values of the quasiaverage fields corresponding to the spin and quadrupole operators : @xmath23 we arrange the mean fields into the magnetic moment vector - field @xmath24 , and the quadrupole moment tensor - field @xmath25 , which is traceless . in the mean field",
    "hamiltonian the operators of neighbors in number @xmath26 are replaced by the corresponding mean fields : @xmath27    in what follows we consider the case of @xmath28 , when the hamiltonian is uniform in the spin and quadrupole operators : @xmath29 we call this case isotropic su(3 ) because the operators @xmath30 , @xmath12 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath34 form a basis of the algebra @xmath35 ; we denote them all together by @xmath36 , and the corresponding mean fields by @xmath37 , which are functions in the spatial coordinate @xmath38 and the time @xmath39 .",
    "for the mean field model we write heisenberg s equations of motion @xmath40,\\ ] ] and take the continuum limit . neglecting correlations between fluctuations of the operator quantum fields",
    "@xmath41 we obtain the following equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lattice distance , @xmath44 is an infinitesimal volume , @xmath45 are structure constants of the algebra @xmath35 with respect to the basis mentioned above .",
    "it is easy to see that the equation is hamiltonian and write the corresponding effective hamiltonian : @xmath46 in the case of @xmath47-dimensional isotropic lattice the effective hamiltonian has the form @xmath48 for more details see @xcite .",
    "here we construct a dynamical system on a coadjoint orbit in the dual space @xmath49 to the loop algebra @xmath50 with respect to the bilinear form @xmath51 .",
    "in @xmath35 we introduce the same basis : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and denote its elements by @xmath60 .",
    "the loop algebra @xmath61 is homogeneous and consists of the eigenspaces @xmath62 , @xmath63 spanned over the basis elements @xmath64 . evidently , @xmath49 coincides with @xmath61 .",
    "according to the kostant - adler scheme @xcite @xmath61 is decomposed into two subalgebras : @xmath65 and @xmath66 including the eigenspaces of nonnegative and negative degrees , respectively .",
    "consider the space @xmath67 of elements @xmath68 with constant @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we denote the entries of @xmath71 by @xmath72 , namely : @xmath73 and use the set @xmath74 , @xmath75 , 1 ,  , @xmath20 as dynamic variables in @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , @xmath77 with respect to the bilinear form , and the factor - algebra @xmath78 acts effectively on @xmath76 .",
    "we call @xmath76 the @xmath9-gap phase space . in @xmath76",

    ", @xmath86 generated by @xmath87 all these functions are in involution with respect to the lie - poisson bracket , so they are integrals of motion .",
    "moreover , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,  , @xmath88 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , ",
    ", @xmath89 are functionally independent and annihilate the bracket , they define an orbit by means of the orbit equations @xmath90 other @xmath91 integrals of motion serve as hamiltonians for the dynamical system .",
    "we recall the orbit structure of su(3 ) .",
    "it has two types of coadjoint orbits : generic @xmath92 of dimension 6 , and degenerate @xmath93 of dimension 4 : @xmath94 every eigenspace @xmath95 , @xmath75 , 1 ,  ,",
    "@xmath20 , is a foliation into such orbits under the coadjoint action of su(3 ) .",
    "an initial condition defines what orbit is chosen in every @xmath62 , and we call their direct product an orbit of the dynamical system .",
    "so the phase space @xmath76 is a foliation into the leaves which are direct products of @xmath9 samples of coadjoint orbits of su(3 ) .",
    "the system of isotropic su(3 ) magnet lives in @xmath96 , the evolution in all other eigenspaces is defined by @xmath97 and their derivatives with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "to proceed we introduce the spectral curve @xmath98 : @xmath99 . in the generic case",
    "it is trigonal of genus @xmath100 : @xmath101 the orbit equations are written explicitly . in the degenerate case",
    "the spectral curve is decomposed as follows : @xmath102 \\big[w\\pm \\big(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\ , i_2(\\lambda)\\big)^{1/2}\\big]^2 = 0\\ ] ] because of the relation @xmath103 , and is reduced to a hyperelliptic one .",
    "the orbit equations are not so obvious as in the generic case .",
    "the dynamical system in question is constructed from the hamiltonian flows of @xmath104 and @xmath105 : @xmath106\\\\ & \\frac{l(\\lambda)}{\\partial t } = [ \\nabla h_{n+1},l(\\lambda ) ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 denotes the matrix gradient @xmath108 commutativity of the hamiltonian flows implies the compatibility condition @xmath109 = 0\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\partial l_a^{(0)}}{\\partial t } = \\frac{\\partial l_a^{(1)}}{\\partial x},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is the zero - curvature equation .",
    "we obtain different equations of motion over two types of orbits . over a degenerate orbit",
    "the equation leads to @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "the reader can recognize this equation as , obtained for the mean fields when correlations between fluctuations are neglected . over a generic orbit",
    "the zero - curvature equation acquires the more complicate form @xmath112 the latter also serves as equation of motion with the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath113 ) @xmath114 where @xmath115 with the symmetric tensor @xmath116 .",
    "this dynamical system was firstly presented in @xcite , and constructed by means of the orbit method in @xcite .",
