    "k.  ball  @xcite introduced the notion of markov type of metric spaces , defined as follows . recall that a markov chain @xmath14 with transition probabilities @xmath15 on the state space @xmath16 is _ stationary _ if @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath18 and it is _ reversible _ if @xmath19 for every @xmath20 .",
    "given a metric space @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we say that @xmath0 has * markov type * @xmath23 if there exists a constant @xmath24 such that for every stationary reversible markov chain @xmath14 on @xmath16 , every mapping @xmath25 and every time @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( here and throughout , we omit some parentheses and write @xmath28 for @xmath29 , etc . )",

    "ball introduced this concept in his profound study of the lipschitz extension problem  @xcite ( see section 2 ) , and the notion of markov type has since found applications in the theory of bi - lipschitz embeddings  @xcite .",
    "the main theorem in  @xcite states that lipschitz functions from a subset of a metric space @xmath0 having markov type @xmath1 into a banach space with modulus of convexity of power type @xmath1 ( see the definition in   below ) extend to lipschitz functions defined on all of @xmath0 .",
    "ball showed that @xmath32 , yet apart from hilbert space and its bi - lipschitz equivalents , no other metric spaces were known to have markov type @xmath1 .",
    "ball asked in  @xcite whether @xmath10 for @xmath33 has markov type @xmath1 , and more generally , whether every banach space with modulus of smoothness of power type @xmath1 has markov type @xmath1 .",

    "we show in section  [ section : discussion ] that the infinite @xmath55-regular tree satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , theorem  [ thm : tree ] is a particular case of the following result which holds for arbitrary gromov hyperbolic spaces .",

    "the classical jordan - von neumann theorem  @xcite states that hilbert space is characterized among banach spaces by the parallelogram identity @xmath80 .",
    "inductively it follows that the generalized parallelogram identity @xmath81 encodes the rich geometric structure of hilbert space . in the early 1970 s , the work of dubinsky - peczysky - rosenthal  @xcite , hoffmann - jrgensen  @xcite , kwapien  @xcite , maurey  @xcite and maurey - pisier  @xcite has led to the notions of ( rademacher ) _ type _ and _ cotype _ , which are natural relaxations of the generalized parallelogram identity .",

    "these seemingly simple parameters turn out to encode a long list of geometric and analytic properties of a normed space @xmath0 , and in the past three decades the theory of type and cotype has developed into a deep and rich theory .",
