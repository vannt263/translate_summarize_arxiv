    "single - molecule - fluorescence imaging has been a powerful tool in particle localization and tracking studies @xcite . in single - molecule imaging , the fluorescence intensity profile of a point light source is called a point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "while the psf is described by an airy function , it is , in practice , approximated by a gaussian .",
    "a gaussian fit to the psf of a stationary single fluorophore has two fitting parameters : centroid and standard deviation ( sd ) .",
    "the centroid is the center of the psf , and the sd is its width .",
    "while the centroid determines the lateral position of the particle in the imaging plane , the standard deviation determines its axial position @xcite and orientation @xcite , as well as the spatial resolution of the fluorescence imaging system @xcite .    error analysis provides the precision for a physical measurement , and is essential for validation of the method used . while error analysis of single - molecule psf centroid measurements has provided the precision for lateral localization measurements @xcite , which enabled differentiation of various biological mechanisms ( such as the walking mechanisms of myosin v on actin @xcite ) , psf sd measurement error analysis will provide the precision in the following applications : ( 1 ) single - molecule axial position measurements , where the sd of a single molecule s psf increases with the defocusing distance @xcite ; ( 2 ) single - molecule orientation measurements , where at different molecular orientations with respect to the imaging plane , the molecule exhibits an elliptical - shaped gaussian psf with a sd that changes in both lateral directions depending on its orientation @xcite ; and ( 3 ) characterization of a single - molecule - fluorescence imaging system , where the measured sd of an imaged single fluorophore determines whether the imaging system is diffraction - limited @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the precision of centroid measurements which has been extensively investigated and applied to many systems @xcite , the precision of sd measurements of single - molecule psfs has not been evaluated . here",
    "we report sd measurement error studies of immobile - single - molecule psfs using analytical calculation , numerical integration , simulation , and experimental measurements . as with centroid analysis ,",
    "the precision of sd measurements is affected by the experimental settings of a finite number of photons per psf @xmath4 , the standard deviation of the background noise @xmath5 , and the camera s finite pixel size @xmath6 .",
    "we have obtained an analytical expression for the psf sd measurement error as a function of these parameters .",
    "our sd measurements have achieved nanometer resolution for a wide range of experimental conditions .",
    "this expression for the sd measurement error will provide confidence in determining a particle s axial position and molecular orientation from measurements using a single - molecule imaging system of known resolution .",
    "the term  standard deviation \" was introduced by pearson in his 1894 mathematical study of evolution @xcite and characterized further in the following years @xcite . for different collections of size @xmath4 of randomly selected data from a common distribution with a theoretical standard deviation @xmath9 , the error associated with the sd measurement of each collection is @xmath10 , as first calculated by pearl in 1908 @xcite .",
    "the same expression was derived more recently by taylor using a different method @xcite . in this article",
    ", we derive the sd error for a psf , which is a collection of photons from a common distribution emitted by a point light source .",
    "we include the additional experimental effects of photon count fluctuation per psf , background noise , and camera pixelation in our study .",
    "we utilized the method developed by bobroff @xcite and subsequently used for centroid error analysis by thompson , larson , and webb @xcite to derive the error associated with sd measurements of single fluorophores .",

    "here we discuss four issues : ( 1 ) causes for discrepancies between results obtained using different methods ; ( 2 ) modifications to the centroid measurement error developed by thompson , larson , and webb @xcite to include the emccd camera photon conversion effects ; ( 3 ) relation between sd error and the error of the measured quantities associated with each of the aforementioned applications ; and ( 4 ) methods to determine the sd error @xmath110 , for dimeric fluorophores and mobile molecules in future studies .",
    "numerical integration results are consistently higher than the analytical results by @xmath143 , while simulation results are higher than analytical results by @xmath117 for all @xmath4 .",
    "there are a number of reasons for these discrepancies : ( 1 ) the analytical @xmath110 result [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sigma2dp3 ] ) ] is obtained by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pesum ] ) for the two limiting cases of @xmath57 at the high photon count and high background noise regimes .",
    "the intermediate regime is absent and thus the numerical integration and simulation results are larger . ( 2 ) when @xmath23 is expanded about @xmath9 , the higher order terms were neglected [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : uncerts2 ] ) ] .",
    "( 3 ) in the @xmath103 calculation ( appendix [ app1 ] ) , the @xmath23 distribution function is assumed to be a gaussian for all pixels of the psf [ eq .",
    "( [ nidistribution ] ) ] .",
    "this assumption will only be statistically accurate for center pixels of psfs with high @xmath4 .",
    "for peripheral pixels , especially for psfs with low @xmath4 , the @xmath23 distribution function approaches a poisson with a low mean , rather than a gaussian .",
    "these different @xmath23 distributions , which have been verified by simulation , were not considered in the analytical calculations .",
    "( 4 ) in simulations , we attempted to model the background count distribution exactly , whereas in numerical integrations and analytical calculations , the shape of the background count distribution was not considered , and therefore did not influence the results .    in summary ,",
    "the analytical calculation of the sd measurement error expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sigma2dp3 ] ) is a reasonable approximation for a large range of experimental parameters .",
    "when the @xmath117 difference is corrected for , the expression is in excellent agreement with our experimental results .",
    "future studies using this formula should be aware of the limitations and be sure to include this @xmath117 difference from underestimation of the true error for similar @xmath116 values .      the psf centroid error expression developed by thompson , larson , and webb @xcite",
    "did not take the photon - to - camera count conversion variance into consideration .",
    "additionally , the theoretical standard deviation @xmath9 , should be modified to include the pixelation effect @xmath68 , with respect to both directions .",
    "we have modified the psf centroid measurement error to be @xmath144 this theoretical expression for the centroid measurement error underestimates the experimental results by @xmath145 .      with regards to the three applications of sd measurements discussed in this article ,",
    "the sd measurement error of a single image can be translated into the precisions associated with each of the application s measured quantities . for the direct translation ,",
    "sd error is the uncertainty of an imaging system s measured resolution ; for the indirect translations , the precisions for axial localization and molecular orientation measurements can be expressed by sd error .    for characterization of an imaging system s spatial resolution ,",
    "if the system is diffraction - limited , the sd of the imaging system should fall between the measured sd of the psf from a visible point light source @xmath146 the sd error @xcite .",
    "thus , sd measurement error directly provides the precision for quantifying an imaging system s resolution .    for axial localization studies",
    ", it has been previously shown that the sd of the psf of a molecule located at a distance @xmath147 away from the focal plane can be expressed as @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath149 nm is the imaging depth of a typical single - molecule imaging system .",
    "consequently , by error propagation , the precision in the sd measurement of a single image , @xmath103 , can be used to determine the localization error associated with the molecule s axial position , @xmath150 : @xmath151    for molecular orientation studies , the polarized psf , for a range of orientations , has an elliptical intensity profile that can be fit by a 2d gaussian with different standard deviations in the @xmath16 and @xmath72 directions @xcite .",
    "when an expression relating @xmath99 and @xmath100 to the orientation is developed , the error in measuring @xmath99 and @xmath100 , once again by error propagation , can be used to calculate an error associated with the reported orientation of the molecule .",
    "in addition to stationary single molecules , sd measurements can be used in future applications to investigate molecules such as stationary dimers or moving fluorophores .",
    "we are currently exploring these two areas of interest : ( 1 ) two sub - diffraction limit , separated molecules labeled with identical fluorophores that exhibits a combined psf with a sd that increases with their separation @xcite ; ( 2 ) a moving molecule ( i.e. a freely - diffusing fluorophore ) which produces a blurred image given a finite exposure time , whereby the measured sd of the resulting intensity profile can be used to study the dynamic properties of the molecule , particularly its diffusion coefficient @xcite . with modification , the method for estimating the sd error of stationary single molecules in this article can be extended to these two cases .",
    "for these studies , the @xmath23 distribution function at each pixel may be different from the gaussian assumption for stationary molecules in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n2 ] ) . a new @xmath23 distribution function for each specific case can be obtained and a new @xmath57 formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : photonuncerts ] ) ] can be derived . using the new @xmath23 distribution function and @xmath57 , the sd error for these cases",
    "can be obtained following the same procedure outlined in the theory ( sec .",
    "[ theory ] ) .",
    "in this article we report the precision analysis for sd measurements of single - fluorescent - molecule intensity profiles .",
    "our analytical expression of the psf sd error allows for proper quantification of the precision associated with determination of the imaging system s resolution and both axial localization and molecular orientation measurements of single molecules .",
    "furthermore , we propose additional studies to characterize multiple fluorophores and examine the diffusive properties of mobile molecules by evaluating the measured sds of their corresponding intensity profile to known precision .",
    "when our theoretical framework is extended to these studies , sd analysis will be advanced into a powerful tool for single - molecule - fluorescence imaging studies .",
    "here we present the complete derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum1 ] ) .",
    "we first obtain a probability distribution function for @xmath14 . at large @xmath4 of a few hundred photons , the @xmath14 probability distribution function at each of the center nine pixels of the psf is a gaussian , while at the peripheral pixels , the @xmath14 probability distribution function is better approximated by a poisson with a low mean .",
    "here we assume that our @xmath152 is significantly larger than 100 photons and the @xmath14 probability distribution functions for all psf pixels are gaussian functions @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath57 is @xmath155 as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chisq ] ) . for gaussian distributed @xmath14 , we have    @xmath156    starting from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chisq ] ) and taking a derivative with respect to @xmath17 , @xmath157    setting the above equation to zero , we find    @xmath158    we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) using the following terms :    @xmath159    inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5])-([eq:8 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath160    moving @xmath161 to the left - hand side , @xmath162 this equation is eq .",
    "( [ eqn : uncerts2a ] ) . neglecting the @xmath163 term , we get eq .",
    "( [ eqn : uncerts2 ] ) .",
    "we now take the mean square of eq .",
    "[ eqn : uncerts2 ] .",
    "note that the average is meant to apply to @xmath14 only , so we have @xmath164    for two different pixels , their distributions are independent , so @xmath165 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ] .",
    "this gives us eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum1 ] ) .",
    "here we calculate the codependence of @xmath166 and @xmath7 in 1d and show that it vanishes . thus the assumption that @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) is fixed when taking a partial derivative of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath17 ( or @xmath16 ) is valid .",
    "expanding @xmath167 about @xmath168 to first order @xmath169 . setting @xmath170 and solving for @xmath7 and @xmath166 , the error associated with the @xmath17 measurement is @xmath171 the cross product term @xmath172 , and arriving at eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sum1 ] ) , @xmath173 .",
    "in appendix [ app3 ] we calculate the 2d @xmath174 . in 2d , the expected counts at pixel @xmath13 , @xmath175 is given by @xmath176 where we assume that the psf is centered at zero .",
    "taking the derivative of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath99 and evaluating at @xmath73 , @xmath177 next , we approximate the summation by an integral where @xmath13 and @xmath175 are continuous from negative to positive infinity .",
    "there are two limits to the approximation , one being the high photon count limit and the other being the high background noise limit . at the high photon count limit , @xmath178 after taking the photon - to - camera count conversion variance into consideration . at the high background noise limit , @xmath179 .",
    "adding the two terms together and replacing @xmath109 by @xmath180 to incorporate the pixelation effect , we arrive at eq .",
