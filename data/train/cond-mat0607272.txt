    "front propagation has attracted considerable research activity during the past years .",
    "a large number of phenomena in different fields ( e.g. crystal growth , chemical pattern formation , and biological invasion problems ) are determined by the properties of various types of fronts .",
    "an important class of problems is related to the case of front propagation into unstable states  @xcite .",
    "they describe situations in which the dynamics of a system is governed by a front which invades a domain where the system is in an unstable state , leading to the onset of a new stable state ( often with spatio - temporal structures present ) .",
    "examples include population dynamics modeled by the extended fisher - kolmogorov equation  @xcite , onset of vortices in taylor - couette flows  @xcite and of convection rolls in rayleigh - bnard experiments ( modeled by the swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite ) , phase turbulence in autocatalytic chemical reactions modeled by the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies have been addressing the properties of reaction - diffusion fronts in homogeneous media  @xcite .",
    "presently , however , an increasing importance is attached to the more complicated cases of fronts propagating in _",
    "inhomogeneous media_. inhomogeneities may have different natures : chemical ( related to spatial inhomogeneities in the concentration of the reagents ) , physical ( reagents diffusion coefficients may vary in space ) , geometrical ( changes in the geometry of the medium ) , etc .",
    "also , inhomogeneities may be either related to an intrinsic disorder present in the system , or may be created artificially .",
    "there have been both theoretical and experimental effort in studying various situations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "examples are numerous in the context of biology  @xcite , population dynamics  @xcite , heterogeneous catalysis  @xcite , or heterogeneous excitable media like the photosensitive belousov - zhabotinsky reaction  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was argued that under some circumstances reaction - diffusion fronts may behave like light - waves when undergoing refraction and reflection  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall be concerned with a different class of phenomena which emerges when the unstable state is produced by reaction processes in a front moving diffusively . in the wake of the front , the dynamics of the unstable state may generate various spatio - temporal patterns .",
    "a prototype of this pattern - forming process is the liesegang phenomena  @xcite where a chemical reactant ( called inner electrolyte ) is dissolved in a gel matrix and a second reactant ( outer electrolyte ) diffuses in and reacts with the inner electrolyte . under certain conditions ,",
    "the dynamics of the reaction product generates a family of high - density precipitate zones whose properties obey generic laws  @xcite which have been understood in terms of a simple phase separation scenario @xcite .    most of the liesegang pattern studies have been made in homogeneous conditions  @xcite , when the initial concentration of the inner electrolyte is uniform . in recent work by grzybowski _",
    "@xcite , however , the experiments were performed in inhomogeneous conditions ( with a step - like profile in the height of the gel containing the inner electrolyte ) .",
    "it was argued that liesegang bands emerging in the two regions of different thicknesses join each other at the step according to a snell law , where the indices of refraction are related to the so - called spacing coefficients of the patterns .    in order to develop a theoretical basis for the above findings , we shall first investigate the properties of the diffusive reaction front in the presence of inhomogeneities in the initial distribution of the inner electrolyte .",
    "this is the simplest way to take into account the inhomogeneities and it allows to obtain detailed understanding and analytical solutions .",
    "the ultimate goal , left for further studies , will be the use of the reaction zone results as an input to the description of the band formation in the spinodal decomposition scenario  @xcite which has been shown to correctly describe the pattern formation in the homogeneous case .",
    "the paper in organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we present a brief review of the main results known about the properties of diffusive reaction fronts in case when the electrolytes are initially separated but otherwise are homogeneously distributed .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the study of fronts when inhomogeneity is present in the initial state of the inner electrolyte .",
    "both analytical results , at the mean - field level , as well as numerical results are given .",
    "cellular automata simulations are presented in sec .",
    "4 and the role of fluctuations is discussed .",
    "we review here the properties of reaction front emerging in an @xmath3 process where the particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 diffuse and react with rate @xmath4 upon contact .",
    "initially , the reagents are separated , with the inner electrolyte @xmath2 occupying the @xmath5 half - space ( homogeneously distributed with concentration @xmath6 ) , while the outer electrolyte @xmath1 is homogeneously distributed with concentration @xmath7 in the @xmath8 half - space . usually , the case @xmath9 is considered and one finds that @xmath1 and @xmath2 react in a confined region ( the reaction front ) which moves in the positive @xmath10 direction .",
    "the properties of this front can be addressed at different levels : a mean - field like one , neglecting fluctuations , or approaches that take the fluctuations into account .",
    "the mean - field study of the front resulting from the reaction @xmath3 has been made by glfi and rcz  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the reaction @xmath11 has been given by cornell _",
    "we shall recall here the main results without going into the details of the calculations .    in the homogeneous initial condition case and with the fluctuations neglected , the concentration of the reagents @xmath12 and @xmath13 will depend only on the variable @xmath10 at all times and the problem becomes one - dimensional .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equations for the concentrations @xmath12 and @xmath13 read : @xmath14 where @xmath4 is the reaction rate and @xmath15 are , respectively , the diffusion coefficients of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the production rate of @xmath16 , which is a quantity of interest since it is the source for the precipitation process in liesegang phenomena @xcite , is obtained by computing @xmath17 .",
    "actually , the region where @xmath18 is significantly different from zero defines the reaction zone .",
    "the center of the zone , @xmath19 , can be found from the condition @xmath20 , and for the case of @xmath21 this leads to especially simple results . indeed , one notices then that @xmath22 obeys a simple diffusion equation .",
    "introducing @xmath23 , the solution is given in terms of the error function @xmath24 , @xmath25 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and the condition @xmath20 yields @xmath26 this means that the front moves diffusively and its diffusion coefficient @xmath27 is given by the equation @xmath28 .",
    "in order to complete the description of the front one needs the solution of the nonlinear part of the reaction - diffusion equations , @xmath29 it is not possible to obtain a general solution of this equation .",
    "however , assuming that the width @xmath30 of the reaction front , defined as @xmath31 is much smaller that the diffusion length @xmath32 ( an assumption that is justified a posteriori ) , one finds that , in the long - time limit , the quantities of interest take the following scaling forms in the reaction zone region : @xmath33 here the exponents are given as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the exponents actually obey two general scaling relations following from the facts that @xmath37 and that the reaction zone is fed by the fluxes of diffusing particles @xcite , @xmath38 in the mean - field approximation , one has an extra scaling relation , namely @xmath39 , and this leads to the above values of the exponents .",
    "note that the case @xmath40 is more complicated .",
    "however , the exponents obey the same scaling relations , and only the scaling functions @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are affected .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the more general reaction @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the main modification arises when expressing the production rate , and one has now the scaling relation @xmath43 , leading to the mean - field exponents : @xmath44      numerical simulations have been performed for the general reaction @xmath11  @xcite , for several values of @xmath45 , including the case @xmath46 , and confirm the validity of the above scaling relations .",
    "moreover , the mean - field exponents are recovered in dimensions larger than @xmath47 . in @xmath48 ,",
    "the exponent values strongly differ from their mean - field values .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that the upper critical dimension for diffusive reaction fronts is @xmath49 .",
    "the validity of this hypothesis has been supported by theoretical arguments ( cornell and droz  @xcite ) based on the scaling behavior of the steady - state front generated by imposing antiparallel fluxes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles .",
    "this situation is much easier to investigate , since the front is time - independent , and depends only on three relevant parameters , the flux @xmath50 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath51 , and the reaction rate @xmath4 .",
    "the results , however , can be directly applied to the time - dependent case too , since the front is formed quasistatically by diminishing fluxes @xmath52 . assuming that scaling applies even when fluctuations are present ( as seen in numerical simulations ) , a dimensional analysis and scaling arguments lead to the following conclusions : first , there is an upper critical dimension @xmath53 above which mean - field predictions are correct ; second , for @xmath54 ( only realizable for @xmath55 ) , the width exponent is @xmath56 , which for @xmath48 gives @xmath57 instead of @xmath34 for the mean - field case .    in summary",
    ", one finds that , in the physically relevant dimensions , the reaction zone moves diffusively and its width is negligible with respect to the diffusion length of the problem .",
    "there is a third result which has not been discussed here but will be important in a later application when the front will figure as a source of particles in the description of the formation of liesegang bands .",
    "namely , the front leaves behind a constant concentration of @xmath16 particles @xcite .",
    "there are many ways to introduce inhomogeneities",
    ". we shall consider here a simple case which , on one hand , can be treated analytically and , on the other hand , mimics a system with a geometrical inhomogeneity quite similar to the experimental setup used in  @xcite .",
    "namely , we shall assume that the inhomogeneity is in the initial concentration of the inner electrolyte .",
    "as described in fig.[geo ] , the reagents are separated in the plane @xmath58 into three zones , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . for @xmath8 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( region @xmath63 ) , while for @xmath5 the half - plane is divided in two domains , separated by a line making an angle @xmath64 with the @xmath10 axis . in the upper domain @xmath65 , @xmath66 , while in the lower domain @xmath60 , @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to an engineered initial inhomogeneity of the reagent @xmath2 .     +     as before we restrict ourselves to the reaction @xmath3 , although the results could be extended to the more general case @xmath68 .",
    "we also assume that the diffusion coefficients are equal @xmath21 .",
    "the mean - field description is again in terms of the reaction - diffusion equations ( [ rd - eq ] ) , the only difference being that the concentrations depend on two spatial variables ( @xmath10 , @xmath69 ) and the diffusion terms are now expressed through the two - dimensional laplacian .",
    "the position of the reaction front @xmath70 is again obtained by solving the diffusion equation for @xmath71 and finding @xmath72 satisfying the condition @xmath73 .",
    "the diffusion equation being linear , the solution @xmath74 for the initial condition in fig.[geo ] can be constructed as a superposition of two particular solutions @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 satisfies the initial condition @xmath77 and @xmath78 and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , is given by @xmath79\\quad\\ ] ] where @xmath80 .",
    "the second function @xmath81 satisfies the initial condition @xmath82 in @xmath63 and @xmath65 , and @xmath83 in @xmath60 with @xmath84 .",
    "the solution is constructed in terms of the green function for the diffusion operator @xmath85 as an integral restricted to the region @xmath60",
    "@xmath86    for simple cases , the integration can be performed analytically , leading to an explicit expression for @xmath87 .",
    "for example , for the symmetric case when @xmath88 , one obtains @xmath89 \\,\\left[1-{\\rm erf}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{dt}}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the position of the reaction front is thus given by the implicit equation : @xmath90 \\,\\left[1-{\\rm erf}(y_f)\\right]=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 are the scaled , _ time - independent _ coordinates of the front .",
    "the corresponding shape of the front is shown in the left panel of fig.[res_io ] for different values of the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .     +     far from the @xmath10 axis ( @xmath94 ) , the reaction front is not affected by the inhomogeneity , it is parallel to the @xmath69 axis and moves diffusively , along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are given , respectively , by @xmath95 .",
    "near the @xmath10 axis , there is a crossover region between the two almost linear segments of the front .",
    "the crossover is smooth and can be characterized by the front position @xmath96 on the @xmath10 axis and by the angle @xmath97 between the tangent to the front at @xmath98 and the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the front position on the @xmath10 axis is obtained from @xmath99 and , of course , it also moves diffusively .",
    "the angle @xmath97 on the other hand is a constant @xmath100 ^ 2}{q_1-q_2}\\exp[-(x_f^0)^2]\\,.\\ ] ]    a similar calculation can be performed for an arbritrary angle @xmath64 , however the results can no longer be expressed in terms of explicit functions .",
    "namely , the position of the front ( in terms of scaled variables ) is given implicitly by the following equation : @xmath101 the profile of the front is given in the right panel of fig .  2 for different values of the angle @xmath64 .",
    "the analytical results have been checked by numerical integration of the reaction - diffusion equations for the reagents @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "note that the infinite reaction rate @xmath4 limit is especially convenient for carrying out the numerical work since the position of the front does not depend on @xmath4 for the @xmath102 case .",
    "however , it does not allow the investigation of the width of the front . for finite @xmath4 , the width of the front in the asymptotic regions @xmath103 follows from the case of homogeneous initial distribution of inner electrolyte , i.e. @xmath104 with @xmath34 .",
    "investigations of the crossover region in the case when fluctuations are also included ( see next section ) indicate that no anomalous behavior occurs .",
    "thus we expect that the width remains much smaller than the diffusion length and the scaling @xmath104 with @xmath34 remains valid everywhere along the front .",
    "the conclusions one can draw from the analytic results and from fig.[res_io ] are as follows .",
    "first , the front motion remains diffusive but the shape deviates from straight line .",
    "second , the distortion is smooth and can be parameterized by the two asymptotic limits at @xmath103 , and by a linear parameterization of the crossover region .      to test whether the mean - field predictions are robust against including fluctuations",
    ", we will compare the above results to those given by a mesoscopic approach , namely by the simulation of the reaction - diffusion front by a cellular automata .",
    "this approach also provides informations about how the width of the front scales with time , since a finite reaction rate is considered .",
    "the model ( described in more detail in @xcite ) is defined on a two - dimensional square lattice of @xmath105 sites with synchronous dynamics at discrete time steps .",
    "one iteration of the automata is defined as the combination of one diffusion and one reaction step .",
    "the diffusion coefficients for a and b particles are chosen to be equal , and the reaction @xmath106 takes place only for particles entering a site from opposite directions .",
    "we use thus a finite reaction rate , since the probability for a reaction of two particles is equal to @xmath107 .",
    "the front position is defined as the region where the difference of the two concentrations , computed in a moore neighborhood for the a and b particles , vanishes . to allow for better statistics",
    "the results are averaged over 750 runs .",
    "the initial state is prepared as illustrated in fig.[geo ] . in the region @xmath63 ( with a length of 100 sites ) , all the sites are fully occupied , i.e. the concentration of @xmath1 s is @xmath108 .",
    "the regions @xmath65 and @xmath60 ( of length of 150 sites ) are randomly occupied by b particles with concentration @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "+     the results of the cellular automata simulations for the case of @xmath88 are shown in fig.[res_ki ] .",
    "we find good agreement between the analytical results and the averaged position of the front obtained from the cellular automata approach .",
    "the fluctuations in the system therefore appear to play no role for the position of the front .",
    "equally good agreement was found for the case with a nonzero angle @xmath111 .",
    "preliminary investigations of the time dependence of the width of the front at the separation line between @xmath65 and @xmath60 seems to indicate the same time scaling @xmath112 as in the homogeneous case ( as mentioned before , far from the inhomogeneity area the behavior is obviously the one following from homogeneous initial distribution of the inner electrolyte ) .",
    "we have considered the motion of the reaction zone for a case of simple initial - state inhomogeneity which mimics the experimental setup where the snell law had been discussed for liesegang bands @xcite .",
    "our main finding is that although the straight - line shape of the front becomes distorted due to the inhomogeneity , the basic properties such as ( 1 ) the diffusive overall motion , ( 2 ) the negligible width , and ( 3 ) the irrelevance of fluctuations in the physical dimensions remain unchanged .",
    "the next step towards understanding whether a version of the snell law is valid for liesegang bands meeting at a line of inhomogeneity should be the use of our present results as an input for a theory of liesegang band formation .",
    "the best candidate should be the spinodal decomposition description which has been shown @xcite to reproduce all the known generic properties of the liesegang patterns .",
