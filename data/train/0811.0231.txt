    "a simple , well studied model that captures dissipation effects , is the freely cooling gas wherein particles at high temperature come to rest through inelastic collisions @xcite . at short times , the particles undergo homogeneous cooling , described by the haff s law @xcite , wherein the kinetic energy of the system decreases with time @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "this behaviour has recently been verified experimentally @xcite . beyond a crossover time @xmath7 ,",
    "the system crosses over to the inhomogeneous cooling state , characterized by clustering , where the energy decays according to a different power law @xmath8 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 is dependent on dimension .",

    "in one dimension , it has been possible to make considerable analytic and numerical progress . in the special case when the coefficient of restitution ( henceforth denoted by @xmath12 ) is zero , _",
    "i.e. _ particles stick on collision , the problem is exactly solvable .",
    "the problem can be mapped on to the description of shocks in velocity field in the inviscid burgers equation @xcite .",
    "burgers equation being exactly solvable in one dimension @xcite , the exact expressions for different quantities like velocity distribution , mass distribution , energy decay as a function of time are known .",
    "this limit ( @xmath13 ) will be referred to as the sticky gas . in this paper",
    ", we will refer to the case @xmath14 as the granular gas .",
    "extensive simulations of the granular gas in one dimension showed that , beyond the crossover time @xmath7 , the energy decay in the granular gas is identical to that of the sticky gas @xcite .",
    "not only is the exponent @xmath9 the same , all the curves for different @xmath12 s collapse on top of each other .",
    "in addition , the velocity distribution was seen to be independent of @xmath12 . finally , the coarsening length scale @xmath15 scaled with @xmath5 identically for both the granular and the sticky gas .",
    "it was thus concluded that the long time behaviour ( @xmath16 ) of the granular gas is described by the burgers equation .",

    "this was shown numerically by measuring the spatial density - density and velocity - velocity correlation functions . in this paper , we focus on the intermediate time @xmath18 , and show that the correlation functions of the granular gas compare well with that of the sticky gas , obeying what is known as the porod law . in sec .",

    "modeling the coefficient of restitution @xmath12 is crucial in defining the model and understanding cooling granular gases .",
    "experimentally , it is known that @xmath12 tends to @xmath19 ( elastic limit ) when the relative velocity of collision decreases to zero @xcite , while for large relative velocities",
    "@xmath12 tends to a constant .",
    "this introduces a velocity scale @xmath0 in the problem , which consequently gives rise to a new time scale @xmath1 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we model @xmath12 as r = ( 1 - r_0 ) exp(-|v _ rel/|^ ) + r_0 , [ eq : r ] where @xmath0 represents a velocity scale , below which collisions become near elastic , _ i.e _",

    "conclusions and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the freely cooling granular gas is an example of what is known as a coarsening or a phase ordering system .",
    "it is well known that in systems freely relaxing to ordering states , there exists a length scale @xmath30 that increases with time  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for usual phase ordering systems , the presence of a dominant @xmath15 results in a robust scaling law called the porod law  @xcite . for scalar order parameters , the porod law states that in @xmath31-dimensions , the scaled structure function @xmath32 for large @xmath33 , with @xmath34 . hence , in one dimension @xmath35 . in the above",
    ", @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the two point correlation function of the order parameter .",
    "we shall refer to systems having the above features as clean phase ordering systems .",
    "the essential fact is that , in clean phase ordering systems the relative fluctuation with respect to the ordered state is nominal .",
    "for example , in the case of a ferromagnetic ising model , a finite system at infinitely large time shows magnetization per site peaked at two possible values of spontaneous magnetization .    a few non - equilibrium systems , e.g. , particles sliding on a randomly fluctuating surface  @xcite , active nematics namely , agitated granular - rod monolayers or films of orientable amoeboid cells @xcite , show a different kind of phase ordering ; the main characteristic of which is undamped relative fluctuations even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , it is called fluctuation dominated phase ordering . in such systems strong fluctuations sustain in time without losing macroscopic order .",
    "the order parameters have broad probability distributions even in the thermodynamic limit indicating strong variation of the order parameter in time .",
    "unlike usual phase ordering , there need not be sharp interfaces distinguishing one phase from the other .",
    "the ensemble - averaged spatial correlation function shows a scaling form in @xmath37 , but unlike clean phase ordering systems , it exhibits either a cusp or a power law divergence at small values of @xmath37 .",
    "hence the scaled structure factor varies as @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "thus , measuring @xmath40 is a reliable test to identify deviations from the porod law .",
    "we recently showed that the freely cooling granular gas at large times @xmath41 also shows fluctuation dominated phase ordering @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlation function shows a power law divergence for small values of @xmath42 .",
    "this in turn indicates violation of the porod law in the density and velocity structure functions with @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the porod law violation here indicates the presence of power law distributed clusters . in other words",
    "the phase ordering is _ not _ clean .",
    "earlier , in a slightly different model in one dimension with velocity dependent restitution coefficient   @xcite , it was found that the coarsening clusters are not long lived and they start breaking up at late times . that result seems to have similarity to what we found in  @xcite at late times @xmath44 .",
    "but interestingly we find that at late times @xmath41 there are two sub - regimes namely @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here",
    "@xcite is the very large scale beyond which all collisions become elastic and the system again becomes homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "the regime @xmath45 is the new and nontrivial regime of  unclean \" ordering that we have found  @xcite and are highlighting here .    for burgers equation",
    ", it was shown numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite [ also see sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] ] , that the ordering is clean phase ordering , such that porod law is obeyed . in this paper",
    "we examine the structure factor for the granular gas for intermediate times and show that porod law is obeyed , like in the sticky gas .",
    "in this section , we define the model and the different physical quantities that are measured .",
    "consider @xmath48 point particles of equal mass on a ring of length @xmath49 .",
    "initially , the particles are distributed randomly in space with their velocities drawn from a normal distribution . choose the reference frame in which the center of mass momentum is zero .",
    "the particles undergo inelastic , momentum conserving collisions such that when two particles @xmath50 and @xmath51 with velocities @xmath52 and @xmath53 collide , the final velocities @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by : u_i , j^ = u_i , j ( ) + u_j , i ( ) , [ vupdate ] where the relative velocity dependent restitution coefficient @xmath12 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) . for the sticky gas , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , such that @xmath13 for all collision velocities , and the particles coalesce on collision .    for both the systems , the granular gas ( @xmath58 ) and the sticky gas ( @xmath13 ) , we have done event driven molecular dynamics simulations with system size @xmath59 in units of the mean inter particle spacing at time @xmath60 .",
    "the particle density is set to @xmath19 throughout .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were imposed . for the granular gas , simulations were performed for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the time regime in which @xmath64 .",
    "thus , formally the sequence of limits are @xmath65 first and then @xmath66 .",
    "in such a regime , the system continually coarsens , and hence we refer to it as a  phase ordering system \" . in this time regime , simulations were done for various different values of @xmath24 ( namely @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , @xmath0 ( namely @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "we found no qualitative variation of our main results with varying values of @xmath72 and @xmath0 . therefore ,",
    "unless otherwise specified , the data that is presented for the granular gas corresponds to @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath75 , event driven molecular dynamics simulations can not go beyond the inelastic collapse .",
    "a similar difficulty is faced when @xmath0 is finite , but @xmath76 .",
    "for example , doing simulation with realistic @xmath24 like @xmath77 ( suggested from viscoelastic theories ) or @xmath78 ( for plastic collisions at large velocities ) , is out of our reach . at such small @xmath24 the shape of the @xmath12 versus @xmath26 curve has a cusp as @xmath79 .",
    "the particles practically do not see an elastic regime and the simulation run into difficulties like particle overlap and inelastic collapse . nevertheless , from our studies of @xmath80 versus @xmath5 ( fig.3 ) , we see that with decreasing @xmath24 the  clean phase ordering regime \" gets extended further in time .",
    "so we hope this trend would continue even for smaller @xmath24 that our simulation could not access . also , the exponents are independent of the @xmath24 values that we have studied , and we hope this trend will hold for smaller @xmath24 too .",
    "the primary difference between a sticky gas and an granular gas is that in the former particles coalesce to form larger and larger mass clusters , while in the latter masses never coalesce . as a result ,  clustering \" phenomena in granular gas",
    "can be meaningfully quantified only if we define a local coarse - grained mass density @xmath81 .",
    "to do so , first divide the ring into equally sized @xmath48 boxes . for the granular gas , @xmath82",
    "is defined to be the total number of particles in the @xmath50th ( @xmath83 ) box .",
    "the coarse grained velocity @xmath84 is defined as the mean of the velocities of all the particles in box @xmath50 .",
    "we now define the statistical quantities that are measured for the granular gas .",
    "the extent of clustering can be measured in terms of the variation of the density distribution @xmath85 .",
    "it is the probability of finding a spatial box with density @xmath81 at time @xmath5 .",
    "the first moment @xmath86 of the distribution @xmath85 is constant at all times as the total mass is a conserved quantity .",
    "the second moment @xmath87 , is defined in our simulation as @xmath88 , where the sum is over all the boxes at time @xmath5 , and the average @xmath89 is over initial conditions .",
    "other measures of clustering are the cluster lengths and gap lengths .",
    "the distribution @xmath90 is the number of clusters with exactly @xmath91 successive occupied boxes at time @xmath5 , normalized by the total number of occupied clusters .",
    "likewise , the distribution @xmath92 is the number of clusters with exactly @xmath91 successive empty boxes at time @xmath5 , normalized by the total number of empty clusters .",
    "the other quantities of interest in this paper are spatial correlation functions .",
    "the equal time , two - point density - density spatial correlation function is defined as @xmath93 , where @xmath82 and @xmath94 are densities at box @xmath50 and box @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the structure function @xmath96 is the fourier transform of @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , the equal time , two - point velocity - velocity spatial correlation function is defined as @xmath98 , where @xmath84 and @xmath99 are the coarse grained velocities of box @xmath50 and box @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the structure function @xmath100 is the fourier transform of @xmath101 .    in comparison to the granular gas ,",
    "as particles coalesce in a sticky gas , they form bigger and bigger mass clusters localized at points in space , such that their total number steadily decreases with time . therefore , without coarse graining , one can measure mass and velocity distribution functions , and the corresponding two - point correlation functions in space . but , to maintain uniformity with the granular gas",
    ", we will continue to use coarse grained densities and velocities for the sticky gas .",
    "in this section , we show that the introduction of a velocity scale @xmath0 introduces a new time scale @xmath1 , beyond which the granular gas deviates from the usual clean phase ordering as seen in the sticky gas .",
    "we first show the different coarsening regimes by means of a space - time density plot . in fig .",
    "[ xt ] , the density distribution is shown for three different time regimes with the darker regions corresponding to higher density .     the spatial density distribution is shown for different time regimes : ( a ) @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) ( b)@xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) and ( c ) @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "[ xt](c ) , we find grey shaded spatially extended patches reappearing , along with large white gaps , implying fragmentation of some large clusters and growth of smaller clusters .",
