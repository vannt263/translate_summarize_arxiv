    "motion coordination of nonlinear multi - agent systems has received an increased interest in the control community due to the potential applications involving groups of robotic systems and autonomous vehicles in general @xcite .",
    "multi - agent systems control can be formulated as synchronization or consensus problems , where the goal is to drive the networked systems ( or agents ) to a common state using local information exchange .",
    "other related problems include flocking , swarming , and formation control of mechanical systems .",
    "built around the solutions of the consensus problem of linear multi - agent systems , several coordinated control schemes have been recently developed for second - order nonlinear dynamics , which can describe various mechanical systems , with a particular interest to leaderless synchronization problems @xcite , cooperative tracking with full access to the reference trajectory @xcite , leader - follower with single leader @xcite or multiple leaders @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "algebraic graph theory , matrix theory , and lyapunov direct method have been shown useful tools to address various problems related to the systems dynamics , such as uncertainties , and the interconnection topology between the team members .",
    "in addition , various recent papers address the synchronization problem of nonlinear systems by taking into account delays in the information transfer between agents , which is generally performed using communication channels . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it has been shown that output synchronization of nonlinear passive systems is robust to constant communication delays if the interconnection graph is directed , balanced and strongly connected . a similar property was shown in @xcite under unbalanced directed graphs using the contraction theorem . in @xcite , a delay - robust control scheme is proposed for relative - degree two nonlinear systems with nonlinear interconnections . with the same assumption on the delays ,",
    "adaptive synchronization schemes have been proposed in @xcite for networked robotic systems under a directed graph .",
    "in addition to constant delays , a virtual systems approach has been suggested in @xcite to account for input saturations and to remove the requirements of velocity measurements .",
    "control schemes that consider time - varying communication delays have also been proposed for the attitude synchronization of rigid body systems @xcite , formation control of unmanned aerial vehicles @xcite , and consensus of networked lagrangian systems @xcite , yet in the case of undirected interconnection graphs .",
    "more recently , a small - gain framework is proposed in @xcite for the synchronization of a class of second - order nonlinear systems in the presence of unknown irregular time - varying communication delays under general directed interconnection topologies .",
    "one important problem when dealing with second - order nonlinear systems in the presence of communication delays is to achieve position synchronization , _",
    "i.e. , _ all positions converge to a common value , with some non - zero final velocity .",
    "in fact , in most of the above mentioned synchronization laws with communication delays , a static leader or no leader are assumed and position synchronization is achieved with zero final velocity .",
    "the only cases where the final velocities match a non - zero value assume a full access to a reference trajectory or to a leader s states ( position and velocity ) .",
    "by full access , it is meant that this information is available to all agents without delays .",
    "the main challenge in this case resides in the fact that imposing a non - zero final velocity ultimately requires some information on the delays to achieve position synchronization .",
    "in fact , a possible solution to this problem might be to explicitly incorporate the delays in the control algorithms as suggested in @xcite for linear second - order multi - agents .",
    "this , however , comes with the assumptions of full access to the desired velocity and the communication delays are exactly known .",
    "another issue that can be observed in all the aforementioned results is the assumption that information is transmitted continuously between agents .",
    "in fact , it is not clear if these results still apply in situations where agents are allowed to communicate with their neighbors only during some disconnected intervals ( or at some instants ) of time .",
    "this can be induced by environmental constraints , such as communication obstacles , temporary sensor / communication - link failure , or imposed to the communication process to save energy / communication costs in mobile agents . for linear first - order multi - agent systems , the authors in @xcite have proposed a consensus algorithm based on the output of a zero - order - hold system , which is updated at instants when the information is received and admits as input the relative positions of interacting agents . in the presence of sufficiently small constant communication delays and bounded packet dropout , the proposed discontinuous algorithm in @xcite achieves consensus provided that self - delays are implemented and the non - zero update period of the zero - order - hold system is small .",
    "a similar approach has been applied for double integrators in @xcite , where asynchronous and synchronous updates of the zero - order - hold systems have been addressed , respectively , without communication delays . here",
    ", synchrony means that all agents receive information at the same instants . in @xcite ,",
    "a switching algorithm has been proposed for second - order multi - agents in cases where communication between agents is lost during small intervals of time , yet without communication delays .",
    "the latter result has been extended to multi - agent systems with general linear dynamics @xcite and globally lipschitz nonlinear dynamics @xcite , where it has been shown that consensus can be achieved under some conditions on the communication rates and interaction topology . in this paper , we consider the synchronization problem of a class of second - order nonlinear systems with intermittent communication in the presence of communication delays and possible packet loss . here",
    ", it is required that all systems achieve position synchronization with some non - zero desired velocity available to only some systems in the group acting as leaders .",
    "based on the small - gain approach , we propose a distributed control algorithm that allows agents to communicate with their neighbors only at some irregular discrete time - intervals and achieve our control objective .",
    "a discrete - time consensus algorithm is also used to handle the partial access to the desired velocity . in the case where no desired velocity is assigned to the team ,",
    "the proposed synchronization algorithm achieves position synchronization with some velocity agreed upon by all agents . in both cases ,",
    "it is proved that , under some sufficient conditions , synchronization is achieved in the presence of unknown irregular communication delays and packet loss provided that the interconnection topology between agents is described by a directed graph that contains a spanning tree .",
    "the derived conditions impose a maximum allowable interval of time during which a particular agent does not receive information from some or all of its neighbors .",
    "this interval , however , can be specified arbitrarily with a choice of the control gains . to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach , we derive a solution to the above problems in the case of networked lagrangian systems , and simulation results that show the effectiveness of the proposed approach are given .",
