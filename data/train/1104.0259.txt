    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the x - ray emission of nio is measured as the incident photon energy , @xmath5 , is scanned through the ni @xmath6 edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "the ni @xmath6 absorption edge corresponds to exciting a ni @xmath7 electron into unoccupied @xmath8 states near the edge ( and a continuum of states further above the edge ) , leaving behind a @xmath7 core hole .",
    "the emission spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) exhibit a peak at emission energy @xmath9 840 ev that corresponds to resonant emission from ni .",
    "this emission is due to the electrons making transitions to fill in the ni @xmath7 core - hole left behind by the ni @xmath6 edge absorption process .",

    "[ fig : fig1]c , black curve ) suffers significantly from self - absorption effects and bears little resemblance to the absorption coefficient .",
    "in addition to the ni @xmath6 absorption , the x - ray absorption and emission also have contributions from non - resonant transitions of other core electrons of ni ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and from oxygen ( the total linear absorption coefficient is the sum of these contributions , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) .@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a and 1b there is a band of emission centred at 524 ev corresponding to the non - resonant emission of o @xmath7 valence electrons decaying to fill in the o @xmath14 core hole ( o @xmath15 emission ) .",

    "similar to previous work@xcite on la@xmath18nd@xmath19sr@xmath20cuo@xmath21 , the agreement between ipfy and tey is very good , highlighting the ability of ipfy to measure the energy dependence of the absorption coefficient of ni without the strong self - absorption effects experienced with pfy .",
    "it has been shown that the ipfy of thick , homogeneous materials is a function of the total x - ray absorption coefficient @xmath22):@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the angles of incidence and emission , respectively , as measured from the sample surface , @xmath28 is the quantum efficiency of the detector at the emission energy , @xmath29 is the detector solid angle , @xmath30 is the contribution to the total absorption coefficient from the excitation of core electron @xmath31 ( ex .",
    "o @xmath14 ) and @xmath32 is the probability of fluorescence at energy @xmath33 resulting from electrons decaying to fill in the core hole left by @xmath31 .    in eq .",
    ", the constant @xmath34 is independent of @xmath5 and @xmath35 depends only weakly on @xmath5 over a narrow energy range ( xanes ) so it can be treated approximately as constant.@xcite this approximation fails over a large energy range , requiring one to account for the energy dependence of @xmath30 and the quantum efficiency of the @xmath36 measurement , which we demonstrate later .",
    "however , in a narrow energy range , it follows that ipfy is proportional to @xmath37 plus an offset proportional to @xmath34 . the crucial feature of eq .",
    "is that the size of the offset @xmath34 is determined by the geometrical factor @xmath38 .",
    "this allows one to determine @xmath39 from experiments with different measurement geometries .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we demonstrate that the ipfy of nio obeys the expected dependence on the sample geometry as detailed in eq .  .",
    "first , the ni @xmath16 pfy spectra measured for various geometries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a ) depict the strong angle - dependence of self - absorption effects in fy measurements .",
    "notably , attempts to correct the pfy for self - absorption effects using the angle dependence@xcite ( not shown ) do not yield the correct spectra .",
    "in contrast , the ipfy spectra measured with the same geometries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) are undistorted and offset from one another , in agreement with eq .  .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b is a plot of the value of the ipfy spectra at a single value of the incident photon energy [ @xmath40 ev ( red circles ) ] as a function of @xmath38 for the given experimental geometries .",
    "as expected , this offset fits well to a straight line with an intercept equal to @xmath41 ev ) and a slope equal to @xmath42 .",
    "subtracting @xmath43 for each of the spectra , we find that they collapse onto a single curve ( the slight variations in peak intensities are primarily due to magnetic linear dichroism in nio due to anti - ferromagnetic ordering of the ni spins in the @xmath44 plane@xcite ) .",
    "the key point of this analysis is that the resulting spectra , derived entirely from experiment , are directly proportional to the total absorption coefficient without any offsets .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath37 is verified by comparing our measurement to tabulated@xcite and calculated@xcite values of @xmath37 . the calculated and tabulated data capture the transitions from the core electron to the continuum , accurately reproducing the edge - step , but do not include the multiplet physics associated with the @xmath7 to @xmath8 transition .",
    "we use the calculated value of the absorption coefficient at the o @xmath15 emission energy ( @xmath45 m@xmath46 for nio from ref .  ) to normalize the subtracted offset and determine the proportionality constant @xmath35 .",
    "note that the o @xmath15 emission is due primarily to @xmath7 valence electrons decaying to fill the @xmath14 core hole and is peaked at a photon energy below the absorption threshold .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : fig2]c has been scaled using @xmath3 ( a non - arbitrary scaling factor ) and is shown along with the tabulated@xcite ( green curve ) and calculated@xcite ( red squares ) x - ray absorption coefficient .    using this single scaling parameter , we find that the measured spectra are in excellent agreement with the tabulated coefficients in both the pre- and post - edge regions , capturing both the energy dependence and the edge - step .",
    "this demonstrates that ipfy provides a measure directly proportional to the total absorption coefficient with the proportionality constant being @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , quantitative analysis of ey or fy spectra requires scaling and offsetting data to calculated values of the absorption coefficient above and below the edge , essentially fixing the edge - step.@xcite this latter procedure requires prior knowledge of the material composition and is subject to uncertainties in the tabulated or calculated values which are estimated at 5 - 20% between 500 and 1000 ev and even higher near absorption edges.@xcite moreover , xas measurements often still have significant structure above an absorption edge in the form of extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) that is not accounted for in the tabulated or calculated values , resulting in additional errors in normalizing data above an absorption edge .",
    "in contrast , with ipfy , we obtain the energy dependence of @xmath37 directly from measurement and can scale the data at a single point well below the absorption edge .",
    "the result of this normalization can be independently checked against the absorption above and below the absorption edge in question and multiple angles can be measured to ensure self - consistency , resulting in a reliable and accurate normalization of the data .      in the nio measurements shown above ,",
    "the described offsetting procedure works well over the narrow energy range covered , giving a quantity approximately proportional to @xmath37 . however , over a larger energy window , the energy dependence of @xmath30 can be significant .",
    "an example of this effect is shown in measurements of ndgao@xmath1 over a wide energy range . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a , the ipfy measured using the o @xmath15 emission of ndgao@xmath1 is shown for three measurement geometries over an extended energy range covering the nd @xmath47 edge .",
    "the spectra are not rigidly offset , instead appearing to be subject to a sloping background in addition to an offset .",
    "this background is due to the energy dependence of @xmath48 and also to the energy dependence of our measurement of the incident photon flux , @xmath36 .    in our measurement , and many xas measurements",
    ", @xmath36 is measured using a au grid with 85% transmission that is placed between the sample and the last optical component .",
    "the total electron yield from the grid , @xmath49 , is used to measure the incident photon flux .",
    "this measurement , however , depends not only on @xmath36 , but also on the quantum efficiency of the mesh , @xmath50 ( the number of electrons generated per incident photon ) , which in general will be energy dependent .",
    "as such , @xmath51 and eq .   should be modified to : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "fortunately , the energy dependence of both @xmath54 and @xmath30 can be unambiguously eliminated from the data by subtracting ipfy spectra measured with different measurement geometries and normalizing to the geometry ( @xmath54 generally also enters into ey and fy measurements , but is typically not corrected for ) . from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to different measurement geometries and @xmath58 is independent of the choice of @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ". we can now write @xmath59 which is simply rearranged to yield the total x - ray absorption coefficient : @xmath60    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , this subtraction is shown , giving @xmath58 that is a smooth function of energy .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c , dividing the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a by @xmath58 , provides spectra that are rigidly offset over a wide range in energy .",
    "subtracting @xmath61 from the spectra provides @xmath39 , collapsing the data onto a single curve , which is then scaled using a calculated value@xcite of @xmath62 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]d . when normalized in this way , the spectra are in excellent quantitative agreement with the calculated absorption coefficient over a wide energy range above and below the nd @xmath4 absorption edge , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize the role of ipfy to study insulating samples that can be difficult or impossible to measure correctly using fy or ey .",
    "an example of such a system is ndgao@xmath1 .",
    "this material is an insulator commonly used as a substrate for oxide film growth . ey measurements of the nd @xmath47 edge in ndgao@xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a , exemplify issues one can encounter when measuring the ey of samples . here",
    "the ey has an unphysical negative edge jump at the absorption edge .",
    "the unusual behaviour is attributed to a build - up in positive charge near the surface of the sample that effectively reduces the number of emitted electrons .",
    "we were able to reduce the effect by recording the spectra by scanning the incident photon energy in the negative direction ( 1020 ev to 980 ev ) or measuring different spots on the sample , but ultimately these spectra are not reliable .",
    "pfy and tfy in this material are also unreliable .",
    "the nd edge pfy measurements , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b , are heavily distorted by self - absorption effects , similar to nio .",
    "in contrast , the ipfy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]c ) provides the correct xas spectrum for nd@xmath63 .",
    "this is evidenced by excellent agreement with xas in pure nd , which like ndgao@xmath1 has nd@xmath63 character and is described well by atomic multiplet calculations.@xcite in this case , both ey and fy provide erroneous results and transmission measurements are not possible due to the thickness of the sample . as such , ipfy provides the only means to measure the correct xas spectrum .",
    "we anticipate ipfy to be widely applicable to similar cases .",
    "experimental studies that require accurate knowledge of optical constants or atomic scattering form factors , such as in modelling of resonant reflectivity or x - ray scattering , stand to benefit substantially from angle dependent ipfy since it provides a measure of the total absorption coefficient . in such studies , it is common to scale and offset xas spectra above and below an absorption edge to tabulated atomic calculations or absorption data.@xcite this procedure requires knowledge of the composition of a material and requires measurements that extend sufficiently above absorption edges to avoid exafs resonances .",
    "it is not always possible to meet these requirements , and in such cases the determination of optical constants or atomic scattering form factors will necessarily be subject to systematic errors .",
    "in contrast , with angle dependent ipfy , @xmath37 and @xmath3 can be determined with a simple fitting approach that does not depend on prior knowledge of material composition .",
    "consequently , scaling the measured absorption to absolute units using @xmath3 enables the determination of atomic form factors with the appropriate edge - step even if sample composition is not previously known or if the xas spectra do not extend sufficiently above the exafs .    as an accurate measure of @xmath37 ,",
    "ipfy spectroscopy could become a powerful tool in non - destructive quantitative analysis of material composition , which can be done separately or in conjunction with xanes or exafs measurements of electronic and spatial structure . without prior knowledge of material composition , it is possible to fit @xmath39 to a sum of the tabulated atomic absorption coefficients in order to determine the relative weights of each atomic species in a sample .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 can be determined by the fitting routine as it too is the weighted sum of the atomic contributions .",
    "thus , in a fully self - consistent way , it is possible to utilize ipfy spectra to estimate the composition of an unknown sample .",
    "even if a quantitative estimate is not needed , the magnitude of the pre - edge relative to the post - edge bears a distinct signature of the quantity of an element relative to the other elements in the material .",
    "a simple comparison of the magnitude of the edge - step compared to calculations or to ipfy on similar materials can then be used as a clear measure of sample composition .",
    "we believe this kind of non - destructive estimate of sample composition will be very useful to xas practitioners as a simple means to verify the stoichiometry of a given sample .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the applicability of ipfy to the hard x - ray regime .",
    "thus far , ipfy has only been demonstrated using soft x - rays .",
    "however , we feel ipfy would likely also be useful for xas at hard x - ray energies . in order to measure ipfy in this case , one would require the appropriate selection of emission lines . while low energy emission lines would exist",
    ", their excitation cross - section would be quite small and the presence of air and/or windows between the sample and the detector may make it impossible to detect these .",
    "however , in compounds with multiple elements , one could in principle utilize non - resonant @xmath15 or @xmath6 emission lines ( at intermediate to hard x - ray energies ) to study the @xmath15 edge absorption of another element .",
    "hence , we believe that ipfy studies at hard x - ray energies are feasible and could be performed using a similar detection scheme as we have used at soft x - ray energies .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated a measure of the total x - ray absorption coefficient using angle dependent ipfy . unlike in ey or conventional fy measurements , the offset in ipfy",
    "can be subtracted unambiguously from experiments with varied geometry to provide data directly proportional to @xmath37 and undistorted by saturation or self - absorption effects . by scaling to a single value of @xmath3",
    ", @xmath0 is obtained in absolute units .",
    "we anticipate this technique to have wide applicability in many areas of science and engineering , potentially opening xas up to non - destructive , quantitative analysis of material composition .",
    "the xas measurements were performed at the canadian light source s 11-id sgm beamline .",
    "all measurements were made at room temperature .",
    "the drain current of the sample provided the electron yield .",
    "an energy - dispersive silicon drift detector ( sdd ) with an energy resolution of @xmath64120 ev was used to collect the emission spectra as a function of incident photon energy .",
    "the sdd was fixed in position ( @xmath65 below the plane and @xmath66 from the beam axis ) and the sample was rotated about the vertical axis to vary @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the angles of incidence and emission , respectively .",
    "dark counts on the detector were negligible . however , a small background in the 200 - 2000 ev region of the nio emission spectra was observed , likely due to a slight mis - calibration of the detector electronics .",
