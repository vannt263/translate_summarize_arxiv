    "interferometers , which are among the most precise measurement devices known today , are based on the interference of two coherent atomic or photonic modes .",
    "the quantity to be measured is mapped to the relative phase between the two modes , explicitly using the wave - like nature of the resources ( atoms or photons ) . however , in the actual detection process their particle - like character becomes important ; the population of the two modes can be at best be counted one by one .",
    "traditional interferometers use uncorrelated resources in two coherent modes which results in a poissonian distribution of the population difference at the interferometer output .",
    "the standard deviation of this distribution @xmath0 is the so called projection noise or shot noise limit .",
    "the best theoretically possible phase precision for uncorrelated resources and linear interferometers is given by the classical cramer - rao bound of parameter estimation  @xcite .",
    "in the context of ( classical ) interferometric phase estimation this is known as the standard quantum limit .",
    "it can be reached with coherent states , the quantum states that are naturally generated by coherent splitting of a quantum mode , as it is routinely done by beam splitters in optics ( with one input port unused ) .",
    "indeed , modern interferometers measuring for example time  @xcite , position  @xcite or magnetic fields  @xcite are limited by this quantum noise leading to a maximal interferometric phase precision of @xmath1 .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to overcome this standard quantum limit for metrology by using quantum correlated , that is entangled , resources within the interferometer  @xcite .",
    "one of these strategies is to use squeezed quantum states  @xcite which have been successfully generated in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the analogue for atom interferometry are spin squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "spin squeezed states can be obtained from coherent spin states by a continuous transformation which gradually redistributes the quantum noise among two orthogonal spin directions .",
    "this property makes them promising candidates for their experimental realization since the degree of squeezing can be balanced with the increased sensitivity to decoherence .",
    "interferometric precision is increased to @xmath2 for spin squeezed states with a squeezing parameter @xmath3 .",
    "many - body quantum mechanics sets an ultimate limit to the phase precision for general interferometric measurements .",

    "we focus on the theoretical concept of spin squeezing , its connection to entanglement and applications in quantum metrology . experimental techniques to generate and detect spin squeezing in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are explained in detail .",
    "finally we shortly discuss two exemplary experiments in which spin squeezing has been observed in becs .",
    "spin squeezing is a quantum strategy introduced in 1993 by kitagawa and ueda  @xcite which aims to redistribute the fluctuations of two orthogonal spin directions among each other . in 1994",
    "it was theoretically shown that spin squeezed states are useful quantum resources to enhance the precision of atom interferometers  @xcite and in 2001 the connection between spin squeezing and entanglement was pointed out  @xcite . in the field of quantum optics",
    "squeezed states have been proposed to overcome the standard quantum limit in optical interferometry already in 1981  @xcite .",
    "these states are similar to spin squeezed states however differences arise from the different variables , quadratures versus collective spin directions  @xcite .",
    "the connection of spins to interferometry becomes obvious when realizing that an interferometer is essentially a two mode system with modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each particle in the interferometer can be regarded as an elementary spin with spin @xmath14 , with two possible longitudinal eigenstates @xmath15 corresponding to the two interferometer modes .",
    "the relative phase measured by the interferometer corresponds to the spin component in the plane spanned by the transversal spin directions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the generalization of this picture to @xmath18 particles , which results in large collective spin vectors @xmath19 , is outlined below .",
    "an extensive theoretical review of two - mode systems also detailing the pseudo spin description can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical concept of a spin algebra with total spin @xmath20 is a powerful tool to describe very different physical systems .",
    "any observable within such a spin @xmath20 system can be expressed by the three spin operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the identity operator .",
    "the collective spin operators @xmath24 can be defined as the sum over all elementary spin operators ( pauli matrices ) @xmath25 , where @xmath26 : @xmath27    the three orthogonal spin components are non - commuting operators .",
    "their commutation relation is @xmath28=i \\,\\epsilon_{ijk } { \\ensuremath{\\hat{\\textsf{\\ensuremath{j}}}}}_{k}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "therefore , any pair of spin operators obeys a heisenberg uncertainty relation which , for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , is given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the variance in @xmath34 direction .",
    "a basis of the general problem can be obtained as the tensor product of all @xmath18 bases of the individual components , each of dimension @xmath35  the dimension of the hilbert space is huge @xmath36 and grows exponentially with the number of elementary spins .",
    "the length of the collective spin @xmath20 is smaller or equal than half the number of elementary spins .",
    "the spin length in interferometry is usually large such that @xmath37 is a good approximation .    in the symmetric case ,",
    "that is , when all operations done on the spin ensemble affect each spin in the same way ( such that there is exchange symmetry ) the problem simplifies considerably .",
    "for example , each elementary spin can be prepared in the @xmath38 state and maximum collective polarization @xmath39 can be reached .",
    "hence , the total spin length is given by @xmath40 and the dimension of the hilbert space dramatically reduces to @xmath41 , linearly dependent on the number of elementary spins .",
    "one possible choice of a basis are the symmetric dicke states  @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "each of the dicke states corresponds to a perfectly defined particle number difference between the two modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 and  since the total number of particles @xmath18 is fixed ",
    "the dicke states correspond to twin fock states in the modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "due to their exchange symmetry the elementary spins can be effectively described as bosons , the schwinger bosons  @xcite . employing the second quantization formalism the creation ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) and annihilation operators ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) of the two modes",
    "can be related to the different spin components  @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "identical bosonic particles in two modes can be described by the symmetric spin model and the schwinger representation given above can be used . when it comes to experiments",
    ", however , an a priori symmetry assumption is a strong constraint .",
    "its validity has to be shown experimentally .",
    "coherent spin states are the most `` classical - like '' pure quantum states of a symmetric ensemble of @xmath18 elementary @xmath51 spins or of @xmath18 two - mode bosons  @xcite .",
    "they are constructed by placing all @xmath18 particles in the same single particle state , in any superposition of the two modes @xmath52^{n } { \\ensuremath{\\left| \\mathrm{vac } \\right\\rangle}}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the vacuum state .",
    "any coherent spin state @xmath54 can be constructed from the state @xmath55 ( all n bosons in mode @xmath13 ) by a suitable unitary rotation with the angles @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of the coherent spin states is that no quantum correlations between the particles are present .",
    "therefore , a coherent spin state features equal variance in any direction @xmath57 orthogonal to the mean spin direction @xmath56 which , according to the gaussian addition of variances , is given by the sum of the variances of the @xmath58 elementary spin @xmath59 particles .",
    "the perpendicular variances @xmath60 of individual elementary spins are by definition isotropic around @xmath56 since there are no subsystems that could cause any correlations ( figure  [ fig : css]a )  @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation ( [ eq.spinheisenberg ] ) for a single elementary spin @xmath61 pointing in @xmath62 direction is @xmath63 leading to an isotropic variance of @xmath64 for the collective coherent spin state , which identifies this quantum state as a minimal uncertainty state since @xmath65 ( see equation  ( [ eq.spinheisenberg ] ) ) .",
    "we refer to the perpendicular spin fluctuations of a coherent spin state @xmath66 as the shot noise limit . + we go back to the first quantization formalism in order to obtain the probability distribution over different sets of basis states  especially the two dicke state bases in the directions orthogonal to the mean spin direction . in order to develop a more detailed understanding of the coherent spin state and its fluctuations we start with the discussion of a special case where each particle is in a @xmath67 superposition of the two modes with @xmath68 relative phase .",

    "@xmath82 to the mean spin length @xmath20 , is given by : @xmath83 as outlined above this limit arises as the classical statistical limit in a system consisting of @xmath18 independent constituents  @xcite .",
    "it is this angular uncertainty which limits the interferometric precision in a ramsey interferometer .",
    "quantum correlations between the elementary spin @xmath59 particles of a collective spin @xmath20 can cause anisotropic fluctuations of the collective spin in the directions perpendicular to the mean spin ( figure  [ fig : css]b ) . in reference  @xcite quantum states",

    "due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation ( [ eq.spinheisenberg ] ) reduction of the variance in one direction causes an increase of fluctuations in the other . real life strategies to obtain spin squeezing might also involve states that are not minimal uncertainty states . for these states , especially for experimentally very important non - pure quantum states ,",
    "the variance in some other direction than the squeezed direction can be much larger than given by the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the effective mean spin length @xmath86 .",
    "+ standard metrologic applications , for example ramsey interferometry , require a large mean spin length . in order to measure the usefulness of spin squeezed states for these applications another definition of the squeezing parameter",

    "a third spin squeezing criterion was defined  @xcite : @xmath89 entanglement is detected by the inequality @xmath90 as detailed below .",
    "here we explicitly use the standard assumption throughout this tutorial that the mean spin points in @xmath75 direction and the direction of minimal variance  if not explicitly mentioned  is the @xmath73 direction .",
    "+ @xmath91 can be used equivalently to @xmath92 to quantify spin squeezing and precision gain in interferometry and we refer to it as coherent number squeezing or coherent spin squeezing .",
    "both quantities remain a useful parameter to detect entanglement or to measure metrologic precision gain even in a non - symmetric situation . to demonstrate entanglement in a collective spin system without presumptions not only number squeezing is required but also the coherence of the quantum state has to be shown .      employing the q - representation  @xcite ,",
    "collective spin states can be conveniently visualized on a generalized bloch sphere with radius @xmath20 . in order to describe the most general spin state , i.e. pure states and statistical mixtures ,",
    "the density matrix formalism is used  @xcite . the density operator @xmath93 in coherent spin state basis is given by @xmath94 , where the integral covers the full solid angle and @xmath95 .",

    "the q - representation uses the diagonal elements of the density operator to represent the quantum state @xmath97 .",

    "the interpretation of this representation on generalized bloch spheres differs from the usual single spin @xmath51 bloch sphere . in that case",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space is two - dimensional and the quantum state representation on the surface of a sphere is exact .",
    "however for symmetric collective spin systems the dimension of the hilbert space is @xmath99 such that an exact mapping to the surface of a sphere is not possible . the position @xmath100 on the spin @xmath59 bloch sphere describes the full quantum state , while the position on the generalized bloch sphere gives only the mean spin direction and , within the following constraints , its fluctuations : the q - representation projects the density matrix on minimal uncertainty states , in particular coherent spin states .",
    "the most obvious consequence is that the minimal extension of a quantum state in @xmath101 on the bloch sphere is given by the uncertainties of the basis states .",
    "+ the q - representation for visualizing collective spins is rather easily implemented with modern plotting tools .",
    "however , there exist more elaborate ways to visualize the quantum state of the two - mode system as described in  @xcite .",
    "the bloch vector visualization described therein has the advantage that the spin noise in all three components of the bloch vector is directly visible .",
    "also the fragmentation of the quantum state , that is , if the @xmath18 bosons do not occupy the same single particle state  @xcite can be seen directly by a bloch vector that lies inside the bloch sphere .",
    "entanglement is only a meaningful concept if the subsystems relative to which entanglement is defined are clearly specified  @xcite .",
    "coherent spin squeezing detects entanglement among the elementary spins  the subsystems are the individual spin @xmath59 particles  @xcite . for @xmath18 distinguishable particles the definition of a separable state , i.e. non - entangled state , is that its @xmath18-body density matrix @xmath102 can be written as a direct product of single particle density matrices @xmath103 : @xmath104 @xmath105 is a probability distribution to account for incoherent mixtures .",
    "entanglement in many - body systems ( for a general review see  @xcite ) is defined as the non - separability of the density matrix @xmath102 meaning the equality in equation ( [ eq.separability ] ) does not hold .",
    "+ due to technical limitations the individual elementary spins can not be addressed before the measurement in many experiments .",
    "however , it is important to note that the elementary spins ( the subsystems ) have to be in principle distinguishable in order to define entanglement among them in a meaningful way  @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath18 particles in a bec the distinguishability is a priory not given .",
    "however , by a gedanken local operation one can pinpoint each particle in space at the time of measurement without affecting the spin properties of the system .",
    "distinguishability is now given by the position of each particle .",
    "if entanglement is detected in the system , it must have been present in the system before the localization , since local measurements can not generate entanglement  @xcite . given that the atoms in the bec are spaced by more than one wavelength of the detection light ( which is usually fulfilled ) , this gedanken local operation means to overcome the technical limitations for addressability and detection of the individual elementary spins .",
    "the fictitious pinning of the particles at the time of measurement ( the photon scattering destroys the bec ) effectively assigns a spatial mode to each particle by which they become distinguishable  @xcite .",
    "the authors of reference  @xcite show that the notion of entanglement in such a collective spin system can be generalized even without such a fictitious pinning of the individual particles .",
    "+ not surprisingly different entanglement criteria can be found when regarding the two modes that define the spin @xmath59 , as the subsystems  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this kind of mode entanglement can not be extracted in experiments without a suitable reference frame  @xcite .",
    "recently , this problem of a missing reference frame for atomic fields has been addressed experimentally and mode entanglement has been shown in a system of ultracold bosons  @xcite .    without the possibility to address the individual elementary spins before the measurement tests for entanglement ,",
    "that is , experimentally accessible criteria , based on the collective spin variables are necessary .",
    "the observables in most experiments so far are limited to first and second order moments of the distributions functions in different spin directions due to rather small counting statistics and technical noise .",
    "based on these , a complete set of inequalities , that is fulfilled for any separable quantum state , has been found  @xcite .",
    "complete in this sense means that assuming the only information available are first @xmath106 and second moments @xmath107 of the distribution functions .",
    "note that these inequalities allow for experimental tests of entanglement , but they are no quantitative measures for entanglement .",
    "such entanglement criteria only allow for the statement : `` yes , that state is entangled with respect to these subsystems . '' or",
    "`` no , that state is not entangled with respect to these subsystems . ''",
    "the coherent spin squeezing criterion given in equation ( [ eq.coherentspinsqueezing ] ) corresponds to a less general form of such an inequality : all separable states fulfill the inequality @xmath108 , but a subgroup of entangled states violate it  @xcite . coherent spin squeezing as an entanglement criterion does not require any symmetry assumption .",
    "however , in the fully symmetric subspace many entanglement criteria simplify .",
    "for example , the detection of spin fluctuations in one direction below the shot noise limit implies entanglement  @xcite , that is @xmath109 holds for any separable symmetric state .",
    "equation ( [ eq.sqsymmetric ] ) is identical to the spin squeezing parameter of kitagawa and ueda ( [ eq.numbersqueezing ] ) showing that in the symmetric two - mode case entanglement is necessary to redistribute the fluctuations of orthogonal spin components . to avoid misunderstandings about the different definitions of spin squeezing",
    "we refer to @xmath110 as number squeezing .",

    "the parameter @xmath111 to be measured couples via a @xmath23 term in the hamiltonian resulting in a rotation of the spin around the @xmath34 axis during the evolution with rotation frequency @xmath111 . the accumulated relative phase @xmath112 by which the initial spin state rotated around the @xmath34 direction of the bloch sphere is finally converted into an observable population difference .",
    "the phase resolution of the interferometer @xmath113 is determined by the projection noise @xmath114 at the time of readout and the local slope of the ramsey fringe @xmath115 ( see figure  [ fig : ramsey_prec ] ) .",
    "the point of maximum sensitivity ( taking finite environmental noise into account ) is reached where the mean population difference is zero and the slope is maximal @xmath116 . the visibility @xmath117 measures the mean spin length @xmath118 . + the amount of precision gain ( or loss ) relative to standard quantum limit is given by @xmath119 , or equivalently by @xmath120 .",

    "+        the phase @xmath123 appears in two connected contexts in this tutorial . on the one hand , for coherent spin states , it is a variable characterizing the full quantum state of the system ( together with @xmath79 ) . on the other hand , it has the meaning of a relative phase between the two modes of the interferometer ( or more general between the modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the two - mode system ) . in both cases",
    "the phase @xmath123 can be interpreted as the mean angle of the spin state in longitudinal direction ( that is , in the @xmath124 , @xmath125 plane ) on the bloch sphere as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : ramsey_bs ] .",

    "spin squeezed states feature reduced noise in one of the spin directions but excess noise in another direction can be present either due to a non - heisenberg limited quantum state or due to an incoherent mixture of several quantum states .",
    "the former might limit precision in standard ramsey interferometry , but specific correlated quantum states enable even enhanced interferometric precision in a generalized interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the latter is easily limiting interferometric precision at a level above the standard quantum limit and experimentally it requires a large effort to prevent decoherence due to technical noise from the environment or due to finite temperature in the system .",

    "this is possible in gradual steps meaning that depending on the amount of spin squeezing the precision is gradually increased .",
    "therefore  at least for moderate levels of spin squeezing  these states are less fragile and they have been realized with a large number of particles but only with a relatively small squeezing factor  @xcite .",
    "interferometric sensitivity for a coherent spin state and a coherent spin squeezed state is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ramsey_prec ] .",
    "for the coherent spin squeezed state the decreased quantum fluctuations @xmath114 reduce the projection noise while the increased fluctuations @xmath129 cause a slight decrease of the mean spin length and therefore of the visibility of the ramsey fringe . nevertheless , the ratio of projection noise and slope of the ramsey fringe  and therefore the phase sensitivity  is increased .",

    "the center of the resonance is at @xmath248 g , but the absolute magnetic field has an uncertainty of approximately @xmath249 mg in this measurement  @xcite . the background scattering length @xmath250 was chosen as a free parameter and the fit reveals @xmath251 . ]    despite of these limitations coherent spin squeezed states in the double well trap were realized with a maximal squeezing factor of @xmath252db  @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of a full atom interferometer beyond the standard quantum limit remains an experimental challenge with such a setup even though the feasibility of the production of coherent spin squeezed states was demonstrated .",
    "the analog of electromagnetic coupling pulses rotating the spin state non - adiabatically needs to be implemented in order to realize a ramsey sequence with the spin squeezed state as input state .",
    "the required non - adiabatic changes are difficult to realize without the possibility to change the nonlinearity directly ( which could be done by using a feshbach resonance  @xcite ) since fast changes in the external trapping potential lead to unwanted excitation of the condensate .",
    "+ using internal hyperfine states to define the two modes instead of the center of mass modes these limitations can be overcome as presented in the following section .",
    "when working with internal hyperfine states of the atoms fast and precise spin rotations are readily available using electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the experimental challenge is to obtain a sufficiently high nonlinearity such that spin squeezed states can be realized within the experimental coherence time .",
    "several ideas to increase the nonlinear interaction have been experimentally realized reaching from cavity mediated interactions in thermal gases  @xcite to state dependent microwave traps on atom chips which allow for the control of the spatial overlap of the two spin modes  @xcite .",

    "such a feshbach resonance may be used to increase the nonlinearity but at the cost of increased particle losses  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_feshbach ] shows the measured resonantly enhanced effective nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneously enhanced losses limit the available time to generate coherently spin squeezed states to a few tens of milliseconds favoring the fast non - adiabatic `` one axis twisting '' method proposed in  @xcite for the generation of spin squeezing  @xcite .",

    "the performance increase due to the spin squeezing is even larger ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "however , it should be made clear that experimental noise is included here , that is , the comparison is not relative to the standard quantum limit .",

    "these different experiments show that atomic coherent spin squeezing can nowadays be realized with a variety of techniques and in quite different systems .",
    "it remains an open challenge to realize a large amount of coherent spin squeezing with atom numbers comparable to those used in modern linear interferometers .",
    "however , the basic concept of spin squeezing and its experimental feasibility has been demonstrated such spin squeezing might help to push the limit of precision measurements in the future .",
