    "scattering of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region is governed to a large extent by the underlying geometrical optics or ray dynamics , which provides the dynamical skeleton over which the residual interference and diffraction effects can be superimposed . in many instances ,",
    "the ray dynamics is very complex , and it displays chaotic features which earns this phenomenon the name `` chaotic scattering '' . what makes the dynamics _",
    "chaotic _ is that the scattering trajectories which come from infinity , are trapped for a long time within the interaction region before they escape to infinity . in the interaction domain ,",
    "the motion is exponentially unstable , and therefore the outgoing trajectories hardly `` remembers '' the initial conditions .",
    "this results in very complex reaction patterns , fractal distributions , self similarity and other attributes which are typical of classical chaotic dynamics .",
    "as is well known , the complex patterns in dynamical systems are due to the existence of a `` strange attractor '' in phase space . in chaotic scattering , which is not a dissipative process ,",
    "the `` strange attractor '' is replaced by a `` strange repeller '' which consists of all the trajectories which are trapped forever in the interaction domain .",
    "the complexity of the ray ( or trajectory ) dynamics manifests itself also in the corresponding wave phenomena ( be it electromagnetic or acoustic waves or all possible de - broglie quantum waves describing electrons , atoms or nuclei ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to illustrate the importance of `` chaotic scattering '' in the context of electromagnetic wave physics .",
    "the system which we studied in this work consists of three parallel metallic cylinders which scatter electromagnetic waves in the microwave region .",
    "this study has been performed by means of simulations and , what is more important , through measurements in the anechoic chamber of the european microwave signature laboratory ( emsl )  @xcite .",
    "this system illustrates in an elegant and simple way the `` generic '' features of chaotic scattering .",
    "it is also a paradigm in the theoretical studies of this subject ( see e.g. , @xcite @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and references cited therein ) .    in the experiment , we measured the scattered fields in the tm mode ( with the electric field parallel to the cylinders axis ) .",
    "the experimental set - up was planned such that one could neglect the coupling to the other polarization component .",
    "the antennas were in the far - field region of the cylinders ( at a distance of about 10  m ) and therefore the wavefront can be considered to be planar .",
    "the incidence is normal to the cylinders axis .",
    "this reduces the problem to the treatment of a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) scalar field scattering of three cylinders in a planar geometry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , we introduce the formulation of the problem and describe a robust numerical method which provides the scattering matrix for any number of non overlapping metallic cylinders .",
    "we use this method to calculate the scattering from one , two and three cylinders .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec : rays ] , we review the most important features which characterize the chaotic ray dynamics in the present system .",
    "the identification of the fingerprints of chaotic scattering of the rays in the actual experiments , where the scattering of waves of finite wavelengths are measured , is addressed in sect .",
    "[ sec : semiclass ] . for this purpose",
    "we make use of the eikonel ( semiclassical ) approximation and propose a few correlation functions which are shown to depend explicitly on functions which characterize the chaotic dynamics of rays . in sect .",

    "we compare the results in the numerical simulations with those obtained in the experiment .",
    "we show the actual correlation functions and compare them to the predictions of the short wave theory proposed .",
    "we end this work with a summary of our conclusions and a few suggestions for further experiments .",
    "consider n parallel infinitely long conducting circular cylinders as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",

    "finally , the matrix @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 denoting the polar coordinates of the center of the @xmath0th cylinder as measured in the global coordinate system .    if we now take @xmath25 outside the smallest circle which encloses all the cylinders , but inside the domain @xmath16 , the first part of eq .",
    "( [ greent ] ) provides @xmath44 .",
    "we then obtain the @xmath10 matrix at large distance from the scatterer by propagating the wave function , whose gradient on the cylinders is now known . at the last stage of the calculation we use the asymptotic expansions of the bessel functions at large distances @xmath25 and the @xmath10 matrix is identified by comparing with the asymptotic expression ( [ asboun ] ) .",
    "the final result reads , @xmath45 with the matrix @xmath16 defined : @xmath46    the method presented above has the advantage that the calculation of the @xmath10 matrix is essentially reduced to the algebraic problem of inverting the matrix @xmath33 defined in eq .",
    "( [ mmatrix ] ) . in principle",
    ", this matrix is infinite .",
    "however , in order to carry on with numerical calculations , we need to approximate it by a finite square matrix of dimension @xmath47 .",
    "the integer @xmath47 is chosen in such a way that the truncated matrix is unitary to within the desired accuracy of the calculation  @xcite .",
    "the normalized scattered field is given in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath10 as @xmath48 where @xmath3 and @xmath49 denote the incidence and observation azimuth angles , respectively .",
    "the 2-d bistatic radar cross section ( rcs ) is then simply computed as @xmath50    the presented formulation takes multiple scattering to any order and is valid for any working frequency , provided that the number of cylindrical modes used in the scattering matrix @xmath47 is sufficiently large . in the next section",
    ", we will focus on the chaotic behavior of the scattered fields in high frequency limit .",
    "under the approximation of the geometrical optics , the electromagnetic scattering is governed by the simple law of specular reflection at the boundary of the cylinders . given an arbitrary frame of reference , any incoming ray can be identified by its direction @xmath51 and by the nearest distance by which it approaches the origin - the impact parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the impact parameter is proportional to the angular momentum @xmath53 where @xmath6 is the wavenumber . in the domain of all possible initial rays @xmath54 ,",
    "there is a compact set of values for which the corresponding rays will impinge on one of the cylinders .",
    "an initial ray in this relevant set will undergo multiple reflections by the cylinders , until it is scattered away emerging as the outgoing ray @xmath55 .",
    "the function @xmath56 where @xmath51 is kept fixed and @xmath52 varies within the relevant set is called the deflection function .    for scattering on a single cylinder",
    "whose center is at the origin , we have @xmath57 the cylindrical symmetry implies @xmath58 , and the actual deflection @xmath59 is independent of @xmath51 . adding another cylinder has two important consequences- the cylindrical symmetry is broken , and multiple scattering becomes possible in the vicinity of the trapped orbit which runs along the line which connects the two centers of the cylinders .",
    "note that a ray which starts at infinity , can approach the trapped ray arbitrarily closely , but it must finally emerge .",
    "the resulting deflection function can not be calculated analytically .",
    "its complex structure is shown in fig .",
    "the complexity is due to the fact that the trapped orbit is unstable .",
    "( the instability emerges because the reflections are induced by concave mirrors ) .",
    "the longer the scattering orbits dwells next to it , the more rapid are the fluctuations in the deflection function .",
    "the concept of `` dwell time '' is essential for the following discussion and it will be properly defined for a general scattering ray ( independently of the number of cylinders it may encounter ) . consider a scattering ray coming from @xmath60 , and after @xmath61 reflections it goes out with @xmath62 . denote the reflection points on the various cylinders by @xmath63 , with @xmath64 . then the dwell time ( measured in units of length ) is defined as @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the speed of light , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are unit vectors in the incoming and the outgoing directions .",
    "the last two terms above , remove the arbitrariness in the definition of the point at which the dwell - time stop - watch starts ( and stops ) to tick .",
    "[ fig1]b shows the dwell time which correspond to the deflection function for two cylinders .",
    "the correlation of the complexity of the deflection with the dwell time is evident .    to generate chaotic scattering , one needs at least one more cylinder , which should be placed such that no cylinder interrupts ( shadows ) the lines which connect the boundaries of its neighbors . in this case , there exists a cantor set of trapped orbits which can be encoded by the following symbolic dynamics : denote the three cylinders by the letters @xmath69 .",
    "then , to any infinite string of letters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 there corresponds an unstable trapped orbit . if the string is @xmath14 periodic @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , the trapped unstable orbit is periodic",
    "this is the `` strange repeller '' which is responsible for the chaotic dynamics in our system : a ray which comes from infinity and is scattered by the three cylinders is affected by an infinite set of trapped orbits .",
    "it can dwell next to any of them for some time , and then , due to the intrinsic instability , it can either be trapped next to another member of the repeller , or scatter out .",
    "the resulting dynamics is much more complex than what we saw in the two cylinders system , and it has the following features :    * the deflection function is singular on a cantor set of @xmath52 values , showing self similar structures which occur on all scales ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . *",
    "the dwell time function is singular on a cantor set of @xmath52 values , which is correlated with the singular , self similar structures observed in the deflection function ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . *",
    "the deflection function displays also smooth sections , which are due to single scattering from the convex hull of the boundary .",
    "these trajectories correspond to short dwell times , and we shall refer to this component of the scattering system as `` direct '' . * excluding the direct component , the rest of the scattering dynamics is ergodic - any bundle of neighbor incident trajectories emerge with @xmath75 values which are uniformly distributed over the relevant set defined above . * the distribution of dwell times is asymptotically exponential ( see fig .  [",
    "fig4]a ) @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the hausdorff dimension of the cantor set of singular points on the @xmath52 axis , and @xmath79 is the lyapunov exponent which characterizes the instability of the strange repeller . *",
    "the distribution of impact parameter transfers ( defined as the difference between the final and the initial impact parameters ) for the ergodic component is approximately uniform @xmath80 @xmath16 is an effective diameter of the part of the scatterer which induces the ergodic scattering component ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .    much more can be written on the mathematics and physics of chaotic ray scattering .",
    "the interested reader can find more details and references in the articles cited above .",
    "the material presented above suffices for the purpose of the following discussion .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath81 is the transition amplitude to scatter from @xmath82 to @xmath83 at a wavenumber @xmath6 . in the eikonel approximation",
    "the scattering amplitude can be expressed as a superposition of amplitudes .",
    "each amplitude corresponds to a geometrical ray which is incoming from @xmath82 and is out - going in the direction @xmath83 .",
    "these rays are identified in the following way .",
    "consider the deflection function @xmath84 where @xmath51 is fixed at the value of interest @xmath82 and one looks for the impact parameters @xmath85 which satisfy the equation @xmath86 the geometrical rays which are incoming at @xmath87 emerge at @xmath83 , and hence they correspond to the desired transition @xmath88 . due to the fact that the deflection function oscillates wildly as a function of @xmath52",
    ", there is an infinite set of values @xmath89 which satisfies ( [ boundarycond ] ) .",
    "the eikonel approximation for the scattering amplitude is @xmath90^{1\\over 2 } _ s { \\rm e}^{i k \\tau(\\theta_1 , \\theta_2)|_s + i\\nu_s { \\pi \\over 2}}. \\label{sclamplitude}\\ ] ] here , the sum goes over all the rays which satisfy ( [ boundarycond ] ) , and the dwell time for each ray ( [ dwell ] ) appears explicitly , and it is considered as a function of the parameters @xmath91 which define the transition .",
    "the pre - exponential factors can be interpreted as the partial scattering amplitudes brought by the individual rays . as a matter of fact , the sum of their absolute squares is the cross section in the geometrical optics approximation .",
    "it is obtained by deleting from the eikonel cross section all the terms which come from interferences of contributing amplitudes .",
    "the integers @xmath92 are the maslov indices .",
    "the scattering amplitude gets contributions not only from the multiply reflected rays , but also from the  direct \" component of rays which scatter from the convex hull of the cylinders .",
    "the statistical treatment we propose is not applicable for this component , and we have to subtract it from the measured or calculated data .",
    "this is done using the following reasoning .",
    "the  direct \" component corresponds to very short dwell times , and therefore its dependence on @xmath6 is very smooth .",
    "therefore , if one subtract the @xmath6 smoothed scattering amplitude one remains with the desired statistical component .",
    "the smoothing is done over a @xmath6 interval of the size @xmath93 centered about @xmath94 . in the present case ,",
    "the smoothing interval was taken to be the entire interval where the measurement was carried out .",
    "thus , the `` statistical '' component of the scattering amplitude is @xmath95    the @xmath96 is the primary object of our statistical study .",
    "its fourier transform with respect to @xmath6 provides the spectrum of dwell - times for the rays which support the transition @xmath97 .",
    "when averaged over the incoming and outgoing directions , it should coincide with the expression ( [ dwellp ] ) i.e. @xmath98 a comparison between the experimental measurement and the classically expected exponential decay is shown in fig .",
    "the behavior is clearly exponential over some 7 decades .",
    "the slope of the curve is equal to @xmath99 , in reasonable agreement with the value @xmath100 , calculated from the ray dynamics .",
    "we will now define the angle averaged correlation function @xmath101 here , we consider a situation where the outgoing angle relative to the incoming direction @xmath102 is kept constant , and one correlates the scattering amplitudes for different orientations of the target .",
    "the @xmath6 averaging is the same as defined in ( [ oscf ] ) . using the eikonel approximation ( [ sclamplitude ] ) and the relations @xmath103",
    "we can approximate the correlation function by @xmath104 to derive this expression , we assumed that @xmath105 is small so that the phase differences can be approximated by the leading order in their taylor expansion .",
    "off - diagonal contributions are discarded due to the @xmath6 smoothing , and the pre - exponential factors are expressed in terms of the geometrical - optics partial cross sections @xmath106 the sum is extended over all rays @xmath107 .",
    "we can now collect together all the partial cross sections which are due to rays for which the impact parameter transfer @xmath108 equals @xmath109 @xmath110 with this definition we get @xmath111 since we subtracted away the  direct \" contribution , we can use the ergodicity of the chaotic component and estimate @xmath112 by the expression ( [ bp ] ) .    in a similar way we can define the cross correlation @xmath113 where , in contrast with ( [ corr1 ] ) we correlate scattering amplitudes measured at two different detector configurations .",
    "the rays which support the scattering in the two configurations are completely unrelated , and therefore we expect @xmath114    another useful correlation function can be defined by @xmath115 by repeating a similar argument as above , one can express @xmath116 as a fourier transform of the dwell time distribution @xmath117 the dwell time distribution @xmath118 was discussed above , and the expression ( [ dwellp ] ) implies that the @xmath119 is a lorentzian with a width which is proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "the two correlation functions obtained above are typical for scattering systems for which the resonances are overlapping and which display therefore erickson type fluctuations @xcite .",
    "one of the most important achievements of the theory of chaotic wave scattering was to recognize the fact that erickson fluctuations are the hallmark of the underlying chaotic ray dynamics .",
    "several other correlation functions ( e.g. , hanbury - brown twiss type correlations ) can also be computed @xcite .",
    "however , the measurement requires the use of two receiving antennas at close ( angular ) proximity .",
    "this experiment was not yet carried out .",
    "before comparing our numerical simulations with the experimental measurements we shall give a short description of the experimental setup .",
    "the measurements were performed in the anechoic chamber of the european microwave signature laboratory .",
    "this chamber has a hemispherical shape with a diameter of about @xmath121  m. it is equipped with two separate tx / rx antenna modules , which can be moved independently along a circular arch in a vertical plane , as well as @xmath122  receiving antennas which are on the uniformly distributed hemispherical dome .",
    "the range from the center of the chamber to all the antennas is the same : @xmath123  m. the system is fully polarimetric and operates in the stepped frequency mode .    the measurement set - up used in the experimental validation is shown is fig .",
    "[ fig : meas - geom ] .",
    "the target ( consisting of one , two or three identical copper cylinders of height @xmath124  cm and diameter @xmath125  cm ) was placed on a rotating table whose axis of rotation is parallel to the axes of the cylinders .",
    "the center of gravity of the three - cylinders coincides with the rotation axis ( vertical axis ) .",
    "two different antenna configurations were used , and they are referred to as @xmath126 and @xmath127 , with    * @xmath126 configuration : tx at angle @xmath128 ; rx at angle @xmath129 * @xmath127 configuration : tx at angle @xmath130 ; rx at angle @xmath129 .    for each configuration ,",
    "the bistatic scattered fields complex amplitude was measured at @xmath131  equally spaced azimuth positions of the table at @xmath132 intervals .",
    "the data were sampled within the frequency interval @xmath133  ghz with a frequency step of @xmath134  mhz .",
    "the acquired data in the frequency domain were empty room subtracted and gated in the time domain in order to isolate the response of the cylinders from the residual antennas coupling and eventual spurious reflections in the chamber .",
    "then a bistatic calibration using a metallic sphere of diameter @xmath124  cm placed at the focal point of the chamber , was applied in the hh and vv polarizations .",
    "some examples of experimental and numerical radar cross section vs. the frequency @xmath135 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] for antenna configurations @xmath126 and @xmath127 and for one , two and three cylinders . as we see , the agreement of our numerical calculations with the experimental measurements is quite good within the entire frequency range .",
    "we invested some effort to understand the deviations which appear for the @xmath126 configuration at the higher frequency range . in principle , the scattering of a single cylinder should not depend on the table orientation .",
    "however , the experimental data show distinct periodic modulation with peak value of @xmath136 15 % .",
    "this can only be explained as due to the finite geometry : the effective scattering angle does depend on the orientation since the cylinder was not placed at the center of the rotating table .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the variations of the bistatic cross section for some specific values of frequency , when the azimuth position of the rotating table is varied .",
    "again we are able to see a quite good agreement with the experimental results which lead us to the conclusion that our numerical calculations simulate quite well the experimental data .",
    "we turn now to the statistical analysis of the scattering matrix .",
    "more specifically we calculate the various correlation functions defined in section [ sec : semiclass ] in order to test the statistical predictions .",
    "[ fig10 ] displays the functions @xmath137 ( [ corr1 ] ) and @xmath138 ( [ cross ] ) .",
    "the slight deviation of the cross correlation from the expected value @xmath139 is due to the fact that we perform a finite averaging over the frequencies .",
    "the autocorrelation function , however is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ corrtheta ] ) .",
    "another interesting quantity we can evaluate is the energy correlation function @xmath140 defined in eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) . from our semiclassical consideration ,",
    "we expect it to have a lorentzian form with half - width approximately equal to @xmath120 .",
    "our results , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig11]a are in agreement with the semiclassical prediction .",
    "a direct consequence of the above result , and of the underlying ergodicity is that not only the amplitudes but also the cross sections show similar correlations in energy .",
    "we expect @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the fluctuating part of the cross section .",
    "again , we calculate @xmath143 and recovered a satisfactory agreement with the semiclassical predictions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11]b .",
    "we have presented an algorithm that takes multiple scattering to any order and we can use it to simulate any experimental configuration .",
    "we present results which show that chaotic scattering can be unambiguously identified in the experimental data .",
    "moreover , the various theoretical simplifications which were assumed , as well as the finite angular resolution in the experiment , did not blur the signatures of the chaotic ray dynamics .",
    "the main conclusion from the present calculations is that in the range of frequencies used in the experiments , the effects due to chaotic scattering are prominent in the present system and , in general in most systems in which electromagnetic radiation is scattered from metallic objects .",
    "the scattered radiation field is so complex , that it shows many features which would be typically attributed to a _",
    "random _ field .",
    "one may investigate the subject further by performing e.g. , the measurements of the hanburry - brown twiss effect , or by considering other scattering systems such as cavities ( see @xcite ) or waveguide networks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also believe that the observations made here can be used , and should be taken into account when heterodyn electromagnetic radiation experiments analyzed .",
