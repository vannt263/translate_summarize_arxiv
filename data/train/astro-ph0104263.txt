    "last couple of years have seen significant progress in our understanding of the relationship between quasar activity and galaxy formation . in the framework of the hierarchical dark - matter cosmogony ( e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 , hnr98 hereafter ) , the formation and evolution of galaxies and their active nuclei is intimately related ( fabian 1999 , granato 1999 , haehnelt & kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the supermassive black holes form proportionally to the dark matter halos .",
    "the process of formation of a massive bh and the active nucleus is the very process of galaxy formation .",
    "the active nucleus and the galaxy evolve together , with bh accreting matter and the galaxy making stars . at one stage",
    "the winds from the active nucleus blow away the matter surrounding it and a quasar emerges .",
    "this is not only the end of active evolution of the quasar but that of the galaxy as well , which is evacuated of its interstellar medium .",
    "the quasar then shines as long as there is fuel in the accretion disk ( fabian 1999 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "high - redshift quasars represent the early stage of galaxy evolution , balqsos at z@xmath3 represent the stage when the gas is being blown away , and z@xmath4 quasars would be the passively evolving population .",
    "massive ellipticals found today might be the dead remnants of what were once luminous quasars .",
    "observational support to the above scheme of evolution is also accumulating . in a classic paper , maggorian ( 1998 ) found that the mass of a bh in the nucleus of a galaxy is correlated with the mass of its bulge ( see also van der marel 1999 and an excellent review by richstone 1998 ) .",
    "most recently , gebhardt ( 2000a ) and ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) found a correlation between the bh mass and the bulge velocity dispersion , a much tighter relation than that between the bh mass and bulge luminosity .",
    "the important point to note is that the nuclear bh seems to `` know '' the galaxy it harbors .",
    "laor ( 1998 ) showed that the above correlation for normal galaxies extends to quasar host galaxies as well .",
    "the similarity of the two correlations is remarkable given the widely different levels of bh activity in luminous quasars and nearby massive normal galaxies .",
    "franceschini ( 1999 ) found an interesting similarity between the evolution rates for the total populations of galaxies and agns . by comparing the evolution of star formation rate per comoving volume in galaxies and the volume emissivity by agns",
    ", they found that the evolution of luminous quasars parallels that of stellar populations in massive spheroidal galaxies .",
    "much of the above observational evidence relates bh masses of luminous quasars , or what were once luminous quasars , with spheroidal masses of massive galaxies .",
    "wandel ( 1999 ) extended laor s work to low redshift seyfert galaxies for which bh masses were available using reverberation mapping .",
    "interestingly , wandel ( 1999 ) found that the average bh- to bulge - mass ratio for seyferts is systematically lower than that for normal galaxies and luminous quasars .",
    "wandel interpreted this result as a scenario of bh growth in which a bh in a seyfert grows by accretion to become a more massive bh in a quasar .",
    "this , however , is highly unlikely since the seyferts are known to accrete at a sub - eddington rate while the luminous quasars in laor s sample accrete at close to eddington rate .",
    "so , in the above scenario , the accretion rate has to grow with time , which is difficult to achieve and contrary to theoretical expectations .",
    "a possible explanation of the laor and wandel results might be that the quasars and seyferts represent two different populations ( mathur 2000 ) .",
    "the quasar phenomenon may be a result of galaxy formation due to primordial density fluctuations or mergers at early cosmic epochs , which were to result in massive ellipticals of today . at low redshifts ,",
    "when new galaxies are formed due to interactions or mergers , similar evolution may take place .",
    "gebhardt ( 2000b ) have now found that the seyferts and normal galaxies have the same bh mass  bulge velocity dispersion relationship .",
    "note , however , that it still implies that the seyferts are different from the normal galaxies in that the bulges of seyferts have lower mass to light ratio , unless the wandel result is purely due to observational uncertainty .    while we now have the observational evidence for a relation between an agn and its host galaxy , we do not know how it got there , or what are the evolutionary steps towards the `` final '' correlation discussed above .",
    "mathur ( 2000 ) has argued that narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) may represent an early phase in the evolution of active galaxies at low redshift . in our scenario , the luminous quasars and the low - luminosity seyferts follow separate but similar evolutionary tracks . in both cases",
    "the accretion rate m = m@xmath5m@xmath6 is large in the early stages of evolution and reduces later on , consistent with the theoretical expectations ( e.g. hnr98 ) . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we determine the bh- to bulge - mass relation as well as the bh - mass to bulge velocity dispersion relation for nls1s and compare those with the normal seyfert relation .",
    "in @xmath7 we detail our method and present interpretation in @xmath8 .",
    "our sample consists of 15 narrow - line agn ( 11 nls1s and 4 nl quasars ) for which soft- and hard x - ray spectra are available in literature .",
    "the central black hole masses for these objects were calculated by fitting their spectral energy distributions with the accretion disk and corona ( adc ) model of witt , czerny & ycki ( 1997 ) ( see kuraszkiewicz  2000 for details ) . in this model",
    "the corona accretes and generates energy through viscosity , and the division between optically thin accretion flow ( corona ) and optically thick flow ( disk ) results from the cooling instability discussed by krolik , mckee and tarter ( 1981 ) . the model is fully described by the following parameters : the mass of the central black hole , accretion rate and viscosity parameter .",
    "the calculated black hole masses are quoted in table  1 .",
    "we determine the errors of the black hole mass estimated from spectral fitting as follows .",
    "the fit is based on two relations : ( 1 ) the asymptotic shape of the disk emission in the optical band is : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is mass of the black hole , @xmath11 - accretion rate , @xmath12 - the inclination angle of the disk , @xmath13 is the hubble constant , f - spectral correction given by color temperature to the effective temperature ratio ; ( 2 ) the bolometric luminosity is : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the efficiency of accretion . in our fits",
    "we adopt the following values : @xmath16  km / s / mpc , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "if any of these values are different , the mass of the black hole would scale as : @xmath20 .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk for seyfert  1s is in the range @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( schmitt et al .",
    "2000 and assuming the accretion disk is aligned with the dusty torus ) , the upper limit for f is 1.7 ( raska , private communication ) , and if there is strong outflow close to the black hole @xmath15 decreases ( up to a factor 2 if the outflow is energetically comparable to the outflows in radio - loud objects ) .",
    "taking all these effects into account we estimate the calculated mass of the black hole to be accurate to @xmath23 in logarithm .",
    "for the sake of consistency and comparison with earlier results , we also calculated the bh masses for the 7 sy1s from wandel s sample , for which x - ray spectra were available .",
    "the results are presented in table  2 .",
    "the calculated black hole masses are compared to the virial masses in tables  2 and 3 .",
    "the masses calculated by the adc model are generally larger than masses estimated by wandel .",
    "we calibrate our bh mass determinations with the virial mass estimates for the objects in table  2 and 3 and find that : @xmath24 .",
    "this relation , together with the calculated and virial bh masses for seyfert 1s and nls1s ( excluding the outlying point for ic 4329a ) , is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the above equation is a good description of the relation between bh masses calculated by the adc model and by the virial method .",
    "there is clearly some uncertainty in the adc mass estimates , as discussed above ( tables 1 , 2 , 3 ) , and the virial mass estimates are also uncertain by a factor of several because of the uncertainty in the geometry of the broad emission line region .",
    "both of these effects contribute towards the scatter seen in figure 1 .",
    "the calibrated black hole masses for nls1s are given in table  3 .",
    "these masses were used to calculate the black hole to bulge mass ratio .      for the nls1s in our sample",
    ", we determined the bulge masses of their host galaxies following the general method used by laor ( 1998 ) and wandel ( 1999 ) , which we discuss briefly below . for most of our nls1s",
    "we obtain the bulge absolute blue magnitudes ( @xmath25 ) from whittle ( 1992 ) .",
    "a galaxy s total blue magnitude ( @xmath26 ) is related to @xmath25 by simien & vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) equation ( for @xmath16  km  s@xmath27  mpc@xmath27 , @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and t is the hubble stage ( defined in de vaucouleurs , de vaucoulers & corwin 1976 ) .",
    "mrk  110 and mrk  335 do not have a hubble type defined in the whittle ( 1992 ) compilation .",
    "however ned quotes a s0/a hubble type for mrk  335 , which we use to calculate the bulge magnitude for this object .",
    "the resulting @xmath25 ( table 3 ) is consistent with that in ho ( 1999 ) .",
    "for mrk  110 we adopt a canonical hubble type of sa .    for nab  0205 + 024 , pg  1402 + 261 and pg  1444 + 407",
    "we take the host galaxy absolute magnitudes from bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which have been corrected for nuclear emission . for mrk 1044",
    "we take the host galaxy magnitude from mackenty ( 1990 ) , who has nuclear emission included in the total blue magnitude , hence in table 3 we quote the bulge mass as an upper limit .    after obtaining the bulge blue magnitudes we use the relation between the bulge b and v magnitude ( worthey 1994 ) b@xmath31v=0.95 , the standard relation between the bulge luminosity and absolute magnitude : @xmath32 and the relation between bulge mass and bulge luminosity for normal galaxies from magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath33 .",
    "the bulge masses calculated this way are listed in table  3 .",
    "we do not have bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath34 ) measurements for the objects in our sample .",
    "however , nelson ( 2000 ) has shown that the width of the narrow emission line [ oiii ] serves as a good representation of the velocity dispersion with @xmath34 = fwhm [ oiii]/2.35 . adopting from nelson ( 2000 ) , we collected from literature , as well as from our optical data , the values of fwhm [ oiii ] for all the nls1s in our sample ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 , wamsteker 1985 , dahari & de robertis 1988 , busko & steiner 1988 , nelson & whittle 1995 , wilkes 1999 ) .",
    "in figure 2 we have plotted the @xmath35 of bh mass vrs .",
    "@xmath35 of bulge mass obtained using the method discussed in @xmath7 .",
    "the dashed line represents the relation for normal galaxies and luminous quasars ( from laor 1998 ) while the dotted line represents the relation for seyfert galaxies ( from wandel 1999 , excluding 3 nls1s in his sample ; we have also re - calculated the bulge masses for these objects , as wandel uses a slightly different relation between the mass and luminosity of the bulge than we do ) .",
    "the nls1s are represented by filled squares .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the relation for seyfert galaxies does not hold for nls1s ; nls1s lie systematically below the line for seyfert galaxies .",
    "in addition , we find that the narrow line quasars also lie systematically below the line for quasars .",
    "the mean @xmath36 for nls1s is 0.00005 , lower by a factor of six compared to @xmath37 for wandel s seyferts , excluding the three nls1s in his sample .",
    "similarly , the bh to bulge mass ratio for nl quasars is 0.0005 , almost an order of magnitude lower than 0.006 for normal galaxies and quasars .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , since we have calibrated our bh masses with those from the reverberation mapping , the relative difference in the bh- to bulge - mass relation of nls1s and normal sy1s is a robust result , though the absolute values may suffer from various uncertainties .",
    "we have not been able to do such a calibration for nl quasars , so we can not place similar confidence in the difference between nl quasars and the quasars in laor s sample .",
    "comparison of bh mass to bulge mass , using bulge luminosity , is a worthwhile exercise even in the light of the new , stronger , correlation with bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "reasons for the differences in two correlations may be many : e.g. hubble types of many bright agns may have systematic errors , or nuclear starbursts may reduce the mass to light ratio of bulges in agns ( gebhardt 2000b ) .",
    "understanding these differences is important .",
    "moreover , here we are comparing two subclasses of seyfert galaxies : regular , broad line seyfert 1s and nls1s , so any systematic problems in determining the bulge luminosity is likely to be the same in both classes .",
    "so , any difference in the two is not likely to be a result of observational uncertainty .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) has determined bh - mass to bulge velocity dispersion relation for seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is noteworthy that all the three nls1s in his sample : ngc 4051 , mkn 110 , and mkn 335 , lie at the lowest boundary of the scatter . in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the @xmath35 of bh mass vrs fwhm [ oiii]/2.35 .",
    "the open squares are the seyfert 1s and the filled circles are the nls1s in our sample .",
    "the straight line represents the relation for seyfert galaxies from nelson ( 2000 ) .",
    "while the seyfert 1s follow the nelson relation , nls1s lie systematically below the line .",
    "the above results support our conjecture that nls1s are young agns .",
    "nls1s are believed to accrete at close to eddington rate , as first proposed by pounds , done & osborn ( 1995 ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , in our scenario the accretion rate is highest in the early growing stage of an agn .",
    "the bh would grow by accretion and eventually the accretion rate would slow down . whether the bulge mass would grow or not would depend upon how young/ rejuvenated the galaxy is , or how complete is the interaction/ merger .",
    "so an agn will follow a vertically upward or diagonally upward ( with both @xmath38 and @xmath39 increasing ) track on figure 2 , as it evolves . similarly , if the bulge velocity dispersion has settled down to its `` final '' value , an agn would follow a vertically upward track on figure 3 .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the bh- to bulge - mass relation might be that the bulge mass to light ratio in nls1s is lower compared to normal seyferts ( see @xmath40 ) .",
    "this might be due to higher bulge luminosity as a result of a nuclear starburst , again supporting our proposal of nls1s being rejuvenated agn ( mathur 2000 ) .",
    "this , however , can not explain the result regarding velocity dispersion .",
    "alternatively , the above results might mean that the bulge luminosities and fwhm [ oiii ] are systematically overestimated for nls1s . while not impossible , it seems unlikely that both the quantities are overestimated .",
    "assuming that our results are not just due to observational uncertainties , and that our scenario of bh growth is valid , some interesting inferences may be obtained .",
    "it can be seen from figure 2 that for nls1s , the relation between bh mass and bulge mass is not strictly linear .",
    "so , the bh mass is not a `` universal fraction '' of the baryonic mass as suggested by haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) .",
    "more likely , the accretion process determines the bh mass ( e.g. hnr99 ) at any given time .",
    "the salpeter time for the growth of a bh , i.e. the e - folding time , is @xmath41 years where @xmath42 is the radiative efficiency normalized to 0.1 .",
    "@xmath43 calculated for the objects in our sample is listed in table  1 . for a bulge with mass @xmath44m@xmath45",
    ", we have a bh mass of @xmath46m@xmath45 for nls1 mrk  493 .",
    "( figure 2 , table 3 ) .",
    "let us assume this to be the initial bh mass .",
    "the bh would grow to a `` final '' seyfert mass of @xmath47m@xmath45 assuming @xmath48 .",
    "so to grow by a factor of 10 , a bh would need @xmath49 years , for a constant accretion rate . since the accretion rate decreases with time , the growth time scale t@xmath50 years .",
    "it is possible that being more luminous , quasars evolve faster than the seyferts .",
    "however , if the evolution of quasars and of seyferts is indeed similar , then quasar lifetimes of about @xmath51 years is inferred .",
    "this timescale is much larger than @xmath52 yr .",
    "proposed by haiman & leob ( 1998 ) .",
    "predict quasar lifetimes anywhere in the range @xmath53 to @xmath51 yrs .",
    "our results are consistent with , and close to their upper limit @xmath1@xmath54 years calculated for @xmath55 .",
    "hnr98 have considered three different scenarios for bh growth in a quasar : ( i ) accretion far above the eddington rate , ( ii ) accretion obscured by dust , and ( iii ) accretion below the critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for a hubble time .",
    "our results , together with laor ( 1998 ) make the third option unlikely . for nls1s",
    ", we have evidence for accretion rate close to eddington rate , but not far above the eddington rate .",
    "there are also several nls1s which are dusty ( e.g. iras  13349 + 2438 )",
    ". so options ( i ) and ( ii ) are plausible",
    ". studies of low redshift nls1s thus provide a unique and relatively easy way to understand the high redshift quasars and their evolution .",
