    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; in this study , we consider only long grbs , so we refer to long grbs as grbs hereafter ) have been mysterious phenomena since their discovery in 1969  @xcite .",
    "last decade , observational evidence for supernovae ( sne ) and grbs association has been reported ( e.g. woosley and bloom 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "some of the sne that associate with grbs were very energetic and blight .",
    "the estimated explosion energy was of the order of @xmath2 ergs , and produced nickel mass was @xmath3 .",
    "thus they are categorized as a new type of sne ( sometimes called as hypernovae ) .",
    "the largeness of the explosion energy is very important , because it can not be explained by the standard core - collapse sn scenario , and other mechanism should be working at the center of the progenitors .",
    "the promising scenarios are the collapsar scenario  @xcite and the magnetar scenario  @xcite . in the collapsar scenario , a rapidly rotating black hole ( bh ) is formed at the center , while a rapidly rotating neutron star with strong magnetic fields ( @xmath4 g ) is formed in the magnetar scenario .",
    "many numerical simulations have been done for the collapsar scenario  @xcite and the magnetar scenario  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we investigate the collapsar scenario .    in the collapsar scenario ,",
    "a bh is formed as a result of gravitational collapse . also ,",
    "rotation of the progenitor plays an essential role . due to the rotation",
    ", an accretion disk is formed around the equatorial plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter around the rotation axis falls into the bh almost freely .",
    "it is pointed out that the jet - induced explosion along the rotation axis may occur due to the heating through pair annihilation of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos that are emitted from the accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "effect of extraction of rotation energy from the accretion disk by magnetic field lines that leave the disk surface ( blandford - payne effect  @xcite ) is also investigated by several authors  @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of extraction of rotation energy from the bh through outgoing poynting flux ( blandford - znajek effect  @xcite ) is investigated  @xcite . in order to investigate the collapsar scenario completely , a high - quality numerical code including effects of a lot of microphysics ( neutrino physics , nuclear physics , and equation of state for dense matter ) and macrophysics ( magneto - hydrodynamics , general relativity ) has to be developed .",
    "although many numerical studies have been reported , such a numerical code has not been developed yet .",
    "thus we have to develop our numerical code step by step .    in this study , we investigate the dynamics of collapsars taking into account the general relativistic effects .",
    "extraction of rotation energy from a rotating bh is one of them .",
    "also , even when the rotation energy is extracted from the accretion disk , the properties of the accretion disk should depend on the properties of the bh : if the bh is rotating , the inner region of the accretion disk should be enforced to co - rotates with the bh .",
    "we investigate how a jet is launched at the center of a progenitor , and how the property of the jet is .",
    "effects of rotation of the bh on the formation of grb jet have not been investigated so much .",
    "barkov and komissarov ( 2008 ) is a pioneering study .",
    "however , only one case is investigated in their study , and the initial progenitor model they used is a simplified one - dimensional model without rotation and magnetic fields  @xcite . since there should be many initial conditions of progenitors ( progenitor mass , metallicity , angular momentum , magnetic fields ) , it should be important to investigate the general relativistic effects using a different initial condition from the previous study . in this study , we use a realistic initial condition for the progenitor model that is developed by woosley and heger ( 2006 ) , in which rotation and magnetic fields are taken into account .",
    "when we investigate the general relativistic effects , one has to develop a general relativistic magneto - hydro dynamic ( grmhd ) code .",
    "so far , there are many studies on grmhd code for fixed background space times using high - order conservative schemes based on either approximate or full wave - decomposition riemann solvers  @xcite or non - conservative schemes  @xcite .",
    "since the accreted mass onto the bh is still less than the initial bh mass in this study , we take the grmhd code for the fixed background .",
    "especially , we develop our code using the conservative scheme of gammie et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with the method of noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for transforming conserved variables to primitive variables .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ grmhd1 ]",
    ", we present the formulation of the grmhd code . in section  [ test1 ] ,",
    "we show results of many , well - known test calculations to confirm the reliability of the code . after we show the reliability , we present results of numerical simulations of collapsars in section  [ grb1 ] .",
    "summary and discussion are presented in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we have developed a two - dimensional grmhd code following gammie et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . we have adopted a conservative , shock - capturing scheme with harten , lax , and van leer ( hll ) flux term  @xcite with flux - interpolated constrained transport technique  @xcite .",
    "we use a third - order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) runge - kutta method for evolution in time , while monotonized central slope - limited linear interpolation method is used for second - order accuracy in space  @xcite .",
    "2d scheme ( 2-dimensional newton - raphson method ) is usually adopted for transforming conserved variables to primitive variables  @xcite .",
    "when we perform simulations of grmhd , modified kerr - schild coordinate is basically adopted with mass of the bh ( @xmath5 ) fixed where the kerr - schild radius @xmath6 is replaced by the logarithmic radial coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "when we show the result , the coordinates are sometimes transfered from modified kerr - schild coordinate to kerr - schild one for convenience . in the following , we use @xmath8 unit .",
    "@xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the speed of light , and @xmath5 is the gravitational mass of the bh at the center . throughout this paper",
    "we follow the standard notation  @xcite .",
    "number of variables that appear in the equations of grmhd is 13 : rest - mass density ( @xmath11 ) , internal energy density ( @xmath12 ) , pressure ( @xmath13 ) , four - velocity of fluid ( @xmath14 ) , and faraday tensor ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that faraday tensor has only 6 independent components due to the relation @xmath16 .",
    "we can reduce the number of independent variables to 8 using the mhd condition ( @xmath17 ) , equation of state ( @xmath18 : @xmath19-law gas is assumed ) , and the unit length of the four velocity ( @xmath20 ) . note that the number of independent equations of the mhd condition is 3 .",
    "we choose ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath21,@xmath22 ) as the 8 independent variables where @xmath21 is the space component of the four velocity .",
    "@xmath22 can be written as @xmath23/@xmath24 where @xmath24 is the lapse function ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath23 is the magnetic field measured by the fiducial observer ( fido ) whose four velocity is @xmath26 .",
    "we call these independent variables as the primitive variables . below , we introduce the conserved variables . of course , number of the conserved variables is also 8 .",
    "thus we require 8 basic equations to follow the time evolution of the system .",
    "the basic equations of grmhd represent the rest - mass conservation , the energy - momentum conservation , and space component of the induction equation that determines the time evolution of the magnetic fields .",
    "these are : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the stress energy tensor that is composed of the sum of the matter part ( @xmath31 ) and electromagnetic part ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath33 is absorbed into the definition of the faraday tensor  @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 is introduced so that eq.([eq3 ] ) looks simple , and it is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "@xmath37 $ ] is the completely antisymmetric symbol . in the fluid - rest frame , @xmath34 becomes ( 0,@xmath22 ) .    in this study , we adopt the conservative scheme for integration of the grmhd equations . in this case , the left terms of eq.([eq1])-([eq3 ] )",
    "are considered to be fundamental variables and called as the conserved variables .",
    "the right terms of eq.([eq1])-([eq3 ] ) are flux terms with a source term ( the second right term of eq.([eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "since we have to estimate pressure of the fluid , we have to estimate the primitive variables from the conserved variables at each time step .",
    "the problem is that the primitive variables can not be expressed analytically by the conserved variables .",
    "thus we have to use the newton - raphson method to obtain the primitive variables from the conserved ones  @xcite .",
    "basically , we adopt the 2d scheme introduced by noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to calculate the primitive variables .",
    "however , it sometimes happens that the 2d scheme fails to converge well , and the primitive variables can not be obtained precisely . in such a case , we first adopt the 1@xmath38 scheme introduced by noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and see whether the 1@xmath38 scheme converges .",
    "if it converges well , we adopt the primitive variables obtained by the 1@xmath38 scheme for the next time step .",
    "otherwise , we adopt the second choice explained in the following subsection .      following noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we introduce convenient variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . these variables , of course ,",
    "depend on the primitive variables .",
    "the definition of these variables are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath42 = @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fluid velocity relative to fido , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be written analytically by the conserved variables . on the other hand , @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "can not be expressed analytically by the conserved variables .",
    "thus , we have to solve @xmath39 and @xmath40 numerically in order to determine the proper , corresponding primitive variables .    here",
    "we show that an upper limit and a lower limit for @xmath40 can be obtained before searching for a solution of @xmath40 and @xmath39 numerically .",
    "thanks to this fact , all we have to do is to seek the solution with the condition @xmath51 . from eq.(28 ) and eq.(29 ) in noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xmath40 and @xmath39 satisfy the following equations : @xmath52 @xmath53 -1 .",
    "\\label{noble29}\\ ] ] from these equations and the relation @xmath54 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy the following relations : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 since @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and at least one of the solution for @xmath60 is less than 0 , there is only one positive solution @xmath61 that satisfies @xmath62 .",
    "thus , from eq.([eq4 ] ) , @xmath40 has to be greater than @xmath61 .",
    "we can understand the behavior of @xmath63 from its first derivative for @xmath40 : @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{eq7}\\ ] ] it is apparent that @xmath65 is a solution for @xmath66 . as for the other solution(s ) , it is not so obvious because the pressure @xmath13 depends on @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , it will be natural to consider that the monotonic relation holds between @xmath40 and @xmath13 .",
    "it means that the pressure rises when @xmath40 becomes larger .",
    "if this assumption is adopted , as long as @xmath66 has another solution , it is a positive one @xmath67 .",
    "this is because when @xmath65 , @xmath13 should be also 0 and @xmath68 $ ] is a positive value .",
    "thus , @xmath69 has only one positive solution @xmath70 .",
    "this holds even if @xmath66 has only one solution at @xmath65 .",
    "also , same conclusion can be derived for @xmath71 : there is only one positive solution @xmath72 that satisfies @xmath73 .    since @xmath74 , the relation @xmath75 holds . in conclusion",
    ", @xmath40 has to be in the range @xmath76 .",
    "thus all we have to do is to find a solution of @xmath40 that satisfies @xmath77 in this range .",
    "this procedure is more expensive than the 2d scheme and the 1@xmath38 scheme , but the solution for @xmath40 and @xmath39 is more likely to be found because the range for the solution of @xmath40 is determined apriori .",
    "thus we use this method as a supplementary one to obtain the primitive variables .",
    "using the grmhd code that is developed in this study , we check whether it can pass many , well - known test calculations .",
    "the first three tests are special relativistic hydrodynamic ( srhd ) or special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( srmhd ) calculations , while the rest of three tests are grmhd ones .",
    "1d shock tube tests are the most basic test problems for srhd / srmhd .",
    "we have carried out a number of the test simulations introduced in komissarov ( 1999 ) and balsara ( 2001 ) . here",
    "we describe only two of them .",

    "the results are shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] , which show that the test calculations are well solved as in the previous studies .      here",
    "2d shock tube problem is done to confirm whether the shock dynamics in the multidimensional flow can be solved safely .",
    "this problem includes the interactions of shocks , rarefactions , contact discontinuities . initially a square computational domain is prepared in x - y plane and divided into four quarter boxes .",
    "initial condition in each box is summarized in table.[tab2 ] .",
    "this condition is same with previous study  @xcite .",
    "we use 400@xmath78400 uniform grid points in a square computational box .",
    "boundary condition is open ones .",
    "density contour at the final stage of the simulation is shown in fig.[fig3 ] , which shows that our code reproduces the previous studies very well .",
    "here we go to a srmhd test .",
    "a famous , cylindrical blast explosion test is done  @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath79 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] cartesian grid with a resolution of @xmath80 grid points .",
    "we define an initially static background with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the relativistic flow comes out by setting a much higher pressure , @xmath83 within a circle of radius @xmath84 placed at the center of the domain .",
    "@xmath19 for the equation of state is set to be 4/3 .",

    "the lower right panel shows the divergence of the magnetic fields in logarithmic scale with magnetic field lines .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous studies .",
    "especially , the divergence of the magnetic fields is kept as small as @xmath85 .",
    "next we consider a grmhd test . a steady , magnetized inflow solution on the equatorial plane around a kerr bh",
    "is considered  @xcite .",
    "initially , the steady inflow solution for the kerr parameter @xmath86 and the magnetization parameter @xmath87 is set , and time evolution of the system is followed by the grmhd code . in this calculation ,",

    "the definition of the norm of the error is @xmath94 . in fig.[fig6 ] , the norms of errors are shown .",
    "we can see that these values converge roughly proportional to @xmath95 , as expected .",

    "we consider the blandford - znajek monopole solution  @xcite .",
    "this analytic solution has been investigated numerically by previous studies  @xcite .",

    "the plasma velocity relative to the fido is set to zero initially , and its pressure and density are set to small value ( @xmath104 ) so that the system becomes force - free like . also , to keep the magnetization reasonably low , when the critical condition @xmath105 is satisfied , density and internal energy are increased by the same factor so that the critical condition holds  @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is set to be 4/3 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations with the kerr parameters 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 0.95 , 0.99 , and 0.995 until time @xmath106 = 200 .",
    "the total energy flux , which is the integrated outgoing poynting flux over the zenith angle , can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is introduced as a convenient variable  @xcite .    in fig.[fig7 ] , the outgoing poynting fluxes ( @xmath109 ) as a function of zenith angle are shown .",
    "the fluxes are measured at @xmath110 at the final stage of the simulations .",
    "we would like to note that the outgoing poynting flux hardly depends on the radius where it is evaluated .",
    "this means that the conservation of the outgoing poynting flux is confirmed numerically .    in fig.[fig8](a )",

    "dashed line is just the interpolation of the calculated values . for comparison ,",
    "the second - order analytical solution is shown by dotted line and the forth - order analytical solution is shown by solid line . from this comparison , we can see that all of them coincide with each other .",
    "thus the results of the numerical simulations by the grmhd code are confirmed by analytical solutions .",
    "the situation becomes different for large kerr parameters . in fig.[fig8](b ) , we plot the same values with fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , but for wide range of the kerr parameters ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "we can see clearly the difference among three cases .",
    "this is because the analytical solution is obtained by the perturbation method in kerr parameter , and it is applicable only for small kerr parameters .",
    "of course , there is no such limitation for the numerical simulations .",
    "thus the total energy flux obtained by the numerical simulation is more reliable than the analytical estimation ( see tanabe and nagataki ( 2008 ) for detailed discussion ) .      here",
    "we present a final test of the grmhd code .",
    "a steady and stationary torus  @xcite around a kerr bh that is supported by both centrifugal force and pressure is solved numerically . of course",
    ", it should be solved as a steady and stationary state .",
    "we have integrated a fishbone - moncrief solution around a kerr bh with @xmath114 .",

    "the lower left panel shows the final state of the simulation with magnetic fields .",
    "the lower right panel is same with the lower left one , but for a wide region . due to the presence of the magnetic fields , the angular momentum in the torus",
    "is conveyed outward and the the torus starts to accrete , and the jet is launched from the bh around the polar region .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "since our code has passed the many test calculations shown in the previous section , we now simulate the dynamics of a collapsar using the code . however , we have to say beforehand that no microphysics is included in the code such as nuclear reactions , neutrino processes , and equation of state for dense matter .",
    "so this is the first step of our project to simulate the dynamics of a collapsar and formation of a relativistic jet of a grb .",
    "we have done a 2d grmhd simulation of a collapsar using the modified kerr - schild coordinate and @xmath131 units .",

    "the calculated region covers from @xmath1321.8 to 3@xmath133 ( that corresponds to 5.3@xmath134 cm and 8.9@xmath135 cm in cgs units , as explained below ) with uniform grids in the modified kerr - schild space .",
    "we adopt the model 12tj in woosley and heger ( 2006 ) .",
    "this model corresponds to a star that has 12@xmath136 initially with 1@xmath137 of solar metallicity , and rotates rapidly and does not lose its angular momentum so much by adopting small mass loss rate . as a result ,",
    "this star has a relatively large iron core of @xmath138 , and rotates rapidly ( the estimated kerr parameter that a bh forming of mass and angular momentum of the inner 3 @xmath136 would formally have is 0.57 ) at the final stage .",
    "of course , what kind of stars are appropriate for progenitors of grbs is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "thus we chosed the model 12tj as a first example of our study because the iron core is large and rotating rapidly , which seems to form a rapidly - rotating bh , among the models listed in woosley and heger ( 2006 ) .",
    "we assume that the central part of the star with 2@xmath136 has collapsed and formed a bh at the center with the kerr parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we also assume that the gravitational mass of the bh is unchanged throughout the calculation .",
    "since @xmath139 , @xmath140 corresponds to 2.95 @xmath141 cm , as explained above .",
    "also , the inner boundary @xmath142 is set within the outer horizon @xmath143 .    since 1-d calculation",
    "is done for the model 12tj , we can use the data directly only for the physical quanta on the equatorial plane . as for the density , internal energy density , and radial velocity , we assume the structure of the star is spherically symmetric .",
    "we also set @xmath144 initially .",
    "as for @xmath145 , we extrapolate its value such as @xmath146 .",
    "effects of magnetic fields are taken into account in the model 12tj .",
    "however , again , since 1-d calculation is done , we do not know the configuration of the magnetic fields .",
    "it is difficult to extrapolate magnetic fields that satisfy the condition div@xmath147 = 0 everywhere . also , there are much uncertainty on the amplitude of the magnetic fields in a progenitor .",
    "thus we do not use the information on magnetic fields of the model 12tj .",
    "rather , we adopt the same treatment in section [ test7 ] .",
    "that is , the vector potential @xmath148 where @xmath122 is the peak density in the progenitor ( after extracting the central part of the progenitor that has collapsed and formed a bh ) .",

    "the definition of @xmath149 is @xmath150 .",

    "is adopted for the rotation axis , while the reflecting boundary condition is adopted for the equatorial plane . as for the magnetic fields , the equatorial symmetry boundary condition , in which the normal component is continuous and",
    "the tangential component is reflected , is adopted .      in fig.[fig11 ] , color contours of rest mass density at the central region are shown .",

    "a jet is clearly seen along the rotation axis . in fig.[fig13 ] , mass accretion rate history on the horizon is shown .",
    "the definition of the mass accretion rate is @xmath161 it takes about 0.15 sec for the inner edge of the matter to reach the horizon .",
    "when the matter reaches there , there is an initial spike of the mass accretion rate .",
    "after that , there is a quasi - steady state like fig.[fig11](a ) is realized .",
    "then , the jet is launched at @xmath1621.1 sec .",
    "after that , the mass accretion rate varies rapidly with time , which resembles to a typical time profile of a grb .",
    "we show color contours of the plasma beta ( @xmath123 ) in logarithmic scale at @xmath160 in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "as expected , the plasma beta is low in the jet region while it is high in the accretion disk region .",
    "we show color contours of bulk lorentz factor around the central region at @xmath160 in fig.[fig15](a ) ( upper panel , in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "color contours of the energy flux per unit rest - mass flux ( @xmath163 ) , which is conserved for an inviscid fluid flow of magnetized plasma , are also shown in fig.[fig15](b ) ( lower panel , in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "this value represents the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath164 ) of the invischid fluid element when all of the internal and magnetic energy are converted into kinetic energy at large distances  @xcite .",
    "we can see that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is still low ( fig.[fig15](a ) ) , but it can be potentially as high as @xmath1 at large radius ( fig.[fig15](b ) ) . at @xmath160 , the strength of the magnetic field ( @xmath165 ) at the bottom of the jet",
    "is found to be @xmath4 g , and @xmath166/@xmath167 is @xmath168 at @xmath169 on the equatorial plane .",
    "here @xmath170 is the marginally stable orbit . for the kerr bh with @xmath86 ,",
    "@xmath169 is 4.23 .",
    "as stated in section  [ grb2 ] , the initial biggest amplitude of the magnetic fields is 7.4@xmath152 g at @xmath153 where the initial density is @xmath171 g @xmath155 , the expected amplification factor of the magnetic fields due to the gravitational collapse and differential rotation around the bh is @xmath172 @xmath162 100 @xmath78 0.016 @xmath78 180000 @xmath173 .",
    "thus the initial magnetic field can be amplified as large as several times of @xmath174 g , which is roughly consistent with the amplitude of the magnetic fields at the bottom of the jet . at late phase",
    ", the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) may be also working , which is discussed in the next section .    in fig.[fig16 ]",
    ", contours of the @xmath91 component of the vector potential ( @xmath151 ) at @xmath160 are shown .",
    "level surfaces coincide with poloidal magnetic field lines , and field line density corresponds to poloidal field strength .",
    "as expected , the magnetic fields are strong at the jet region , which makes the plasma beta very low . from fig.[fig16 ] , the opening angle of the jet is estimated as @xmath175 . from fig.[fig14 ] , [ fig15](b ) , and [ fig16 ]",
    ", this jet should correspond to the poynting flux jet  @xcite .",
    "this jet is surrounded by the funnel - wall jet region  @xcite , which is shown in fig.[fig17 ] below .    in table.[tab3 ] and",
    "[ tab4 ] , the integrated energies of matter and electromagnetic field at @xmath160 are shown .",
    "the integrated region is between the horizon and @xmath156 ( for table.[tab3 ] ) or @xmath176 ( for table.[tab4 ] ) , and within the zenith angle measured from the polar axis . as for the matter component ,",
    "the contribution of the rest mass energy is subtracted .",
    "that is , @xmath177 factor 2 is coming from the symmetry of the system with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "the field part can be written as @xmath178 it can be seen that the energy in electromagnetic field dominates that in matter within @xmath179 , while they become comparable within @xmath180 . also , the integrated energy is still less than the typical explosion energy of a grb ( @xmath181erg ; frail et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "finally , we show the rest - mass density , outgoing mass flux , and outgoing poynting flux in fig.[fig17 ] .",
    "the top panel ( a ) shows the rest - mass density ( g @xmath155 ) as a function of the zenith angle at @xmath182 and @xmath160 .",
    "it is seen that the low - density region is realized around the polar axis , which corresponds to the jet region ( 0.1 radian corresponds to 5.7@xmath183 ) .",
    "the middle panel ( b ) shows the outgoing mass flux @xmath184 ( g @xmath185 s@xmath186 ) at @xmath187 and @xmath160 .",
    "it is seen that the outgoing mass flux exists around @xmath188 , which corresponds to the funnel - wall jet  @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel ( c ) shows the outgoing poynting flux ( in units of 10@xmath189erg s@xmath186 rad@xmath186 ) at @xmath190 and @xmath160 .",
    "definition of the outgoing poynting flux is @xmath191 factor 2 is coming from the assumption of the symmetry of the system with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "we can see that the positive outgoing poynting flux exists at the jet region ( @xmath192 in radian ) .",
    "the integrated energy of the outgoing poynting flux at @xmath190 and @xmath160 is @xmath193 erg s@xmath186 .",
    "since the duration of the jet in this study is @xmath194 s , this outgoing poynting flux seems to be too weak to explain the energy of the jet listed in table.[tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] .",
    "thus we conclude that the jet is launched mainly by the magnetic field amplified by the gravitational collapse and differential rotation around the bh , rather than the blandford - znajek mechanism in this study .",
    "in order to investigate the formation of relativistic jets at the center of a progenitor of a grb , we have developed a two - dimensional grmhd code . in order to confirm the reliability of the code ,",
    "we have shown that the code passes many , well - known test calculations .",
    "then we have performed a numerical simulation of a collapsar using a realistic progenitor model .",
    "we have followed the time evolution of the system for 1.773 s , and it was shown that a jet is launched from the center of the progenitor .",
    "we also found that the mass accretion rate is in quasi - stable state before the launch of the jet , while it shows rapid time variability that resembles to a typical time profile of a grb after the launch .",
    "the structure of the jet is similar to the previous study : a poynting flux jet is surrounded by a funnel - wall jet . even at the final stage of the simulation ,",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is still low , and the total energy of the jet is still as small as @xmath0 erg .",
    "however , we found that the energy flux per unit rest - mass flux ( @xmath163 ) is as high as @xmath1 at the at the bottom of the jet .",
    "thus we conclude that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet can be potentially high when it propagates outward .",
    "also , as long as the duration of the activity of the central engine is long enough , the total energy of the jet can be large enough to explain the typical explosion energy of a grb ( @xmath181 erg ) .",
    "it is shown that the outgoing poynting flux exists at the horizon around the polar region , which proves that the blandford - znajek mechanism is working . however , we conclude that the jet is launched mainly by the magnetic field amplified by the gravitational collapse and differential rotation around the bh , rather than the blandford - znajek mechanism in this study .",
    "when we apply the blandford - znajek formula  @xcite , the integrated outgoing poynting flux is @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 g @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "this value becomes @xmath200 erg s@xmath186 for the jet with opening angle @xmath201 , which is comparable to our numerical result ( fig.[fig17](c ) ) .",
    "as for the efficiency of converting the released gravitational energy to the jet s energy , it can be estimated as follows : the mass accretion rate is @xmath202 s@xmath186 ( fig.[fig13 ] ) , the total energy of the jet at the final stage is @xmath203 erg ( table.[tab3 ] ) , and the duration of the jet is @xmath194 s ( fig.[fig13 ] ) . thus the efficiency can be estimated as @xmath204 .",
    "when we use the outgoing poynting flux at the horizon ( 4.6@xmath205erg s@xmath186 ) , the efficiency is as low as @xmath206 .",
    "these values seem to be very small compared with the previous study  @xcite .",
    "one of the reason will be because they used an almost steady disk model . on the other hand",
    ", we used a realistic progenitor model that collapses gravitationally .",
    "thus the resulting mass accretion rate is pretty high .",
    "second reason may be because the efficiency is still low even at the final stage of the simulation .",
    "if we perform the simulation further , the efficiency may become higher with time : mass accretion rate will become smaller , and the jet energy might be larger due to the amplification of the magnetic fields due to winding - up ( and mri ) effects .",
    "also , when the initial amplitude of the magnetic field is set to be larger ( as in barkov and komissarov 2008 ) , the efficiency may be enhanced .",
    "further , we should investigate the dependence of the dynamics on progenitor models as well as the kerr parameter of the bh .",
    "we are planning to investigate this point systematically in the next paper .",
    "it is well known that the system is unstable against mri when there is a strong negative shear profile @xmath207  @xcite , where @xmath208 is the angular velocity .",
    "the saturation toroidal magnetic field strength is roughly expected to be @xmath209  @xcite , which is confirmed by semi - global simulations  @xcite .",
    "the saturation poloidal magnetic field strength is roughly an order of magnitude smaller  @xcite . thus @xmath210 may be amplified by mri as strong as @xmath211 g @xmath212 where @xmath213 is @xmath214 rad s@xmath186 .",
    "the characteristic timescale for saturating the mri is the alfv@xmath215n crossing time : @xmath216ms @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 are the radius in units of @xmath221 cm , the density in units of @xmath222 g @xmath155 , and the amplitude of magnetic fields in units of @xmath223 g , respectively .",
    "thus this characteristic timescale can be shorter than the winding - up timescale for strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , the length scale of the mode with the largest mri growth rate is approximately @xmath224 cm @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the rotation period in units of 0.5 ms , which is too short to be resolved numerically .",
    "at least , it is not resolved in the beginning of the simulations . after the magnetic field is amplified to a certain value due to gravitational collapse and winding - up effect , mri may be working in this study  @xcite",
    ". it will be necessary to develop a sophisticated code that takes into account the mri effectively with help of semi - global simulations  @xcite in order to evaluate the influence of mri on the dynamics of a collapsar .",
    "it is well known that it becomes difficult to obtain the matter part of the primitive variables ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath21 ) precisely by the newton - raphson method  @xcite due to numerical truncation errors  @xcite when the electromagnetic part of the stress energy tensor ( @xmath227 ) greatly exceeds the matter part ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "the problem is that the time integration of the electromagnetic part does not become so reliable , either .",
    "this is because the mhd condition ( @xmath229 ) is implicitly assumed in the basic equations , and the resulting basic equation of electromagnetic part depends on the velocity of fluid ( eq.[eq3 ] ) .",
    "such pathological conditions may be realized at the bottom of the jet in our study . in order to confirm the validity of our results in this study",
    ", we are planning to develop a general relativistic force - free code that is coupled with the grmhd code sophisticatedly  @xcite .",
    "it is very important to evaluate the terminal bulk lorentz factor , because grbs are considered to be emissions from relativistic flows with their bulk lorentz factors greater than @xmath1  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although an ad - hoc thermal ( and kinetic ) energy deposition into the polar region seems to lead to relativistic jets with bulk lorentz factors @xmath230  @xcite , it is still controversial whether such ad - hoc energy deposition is justified by numerical simulations with proper neutrino physics  @xcite . on the other hand , numerical study on the acceleration of electromagnetically powered jet requires quite high - resolution  @xcite . due to the reason , a simplified jet model with an idealized boundary condition",
    "is used at present in order to investigate whether the initial poynting flux can be effectively converted into kinetic energy  @xcite . according to their results ,",
    "as long as confinement of the jet is realized , acceleration operates over several decades in radius and considerable fraction of the poynting flux can be converted into the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , from the high - ratio of the poynting flux relative to rest - mass flux seen in our study ( fig.[fig15](b ) ) , a relativistic jet with high bulk lorentz factor may be realized at large radius .",
    "it is true that the two - dimensional restriction can be a significant limitation .",
    "first , anti - dynamo theorem  @xcite prevents the indefinite maintenance of the poloidal magnetic field in the face of dissipation .",
    "second , axisymmetric simulations tend to overemphasize the channel mode  @xcite , which produces coherent internal magnetized flows rather than the more generic mhd turbulence .",
    "hydrodynamic instability in the azimuthal direction may be also very important  @xcite .",
    "thus we are planning to develop a three - dimensional grmhd code  @xcite and investigate the difference between two - dimensional simulations of collapsars with three - dimensional ones .    in this study , we assumed that the central region of the progenitor has collapsed and a bh is formed at the center with surrounding envelope unchanged .",
    "thus we solved the grmhd equation on a fixed background .",
    "but the final goal of our project is to study how a grb is formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star .",
    "thus we are planning to develop a grmhd code on a dynamical background , which makes the study on the gravitational collapse and bh formation at the center of a massive star possible  @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "photo - disintegration of nuclei and neutrino processes are not taken into account .",
    "photo - disintegration absorb considerable amount of thermal energy , and cooling / heating due to neutrino processes may have great influence on the dynamics of a collapsar  @xcite . especially , pair - annihilation of electron - type neutrinos may be a key process to drive a grb jet  @xcite .",
    "thus we are planning to include such microphysics in our code , and perform more realistic simulations of collapsars .",
    "the sne associated with grbs often show peculiar properties .",
    "some are very energetic and blight  @xcite , but others prohibit such blight sne from being accompanied  @xcite . since the brightness of sne depends on the mass of produced @xmath231  @xcite , it is suggested that there is a huge variety of the amount of @xmath231 in a sn that associates with a grb .",
    "it is still controversial where and when @xmath231 is produced in a sn accompanied by a grb  @xcite .",
    "it may be produced in a grb jet  @xcite , or it may be produced in ( or outflow from ) the accretion disk around the bh  @xcite , or it may be synthesized around a proto - neutron star  @xcite . at present , it is impossible to investigate the explosive nucleosynthesis in a collapsar in our code because nuclear reactions are not taken into account .",
    "we are planning to include this effect , and study the site of @xmath231 production .",
    "also , study of a grb as a possible site where very heavy elements and light elements are synthesized is very important  @xcite .",
