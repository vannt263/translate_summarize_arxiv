    "highly frustrated magnets are a fascinating area of research with many challenges and surprises @xcite .",
    "one exotic case is the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice , where in particular an unusually large number of low - lying singlets was observed numerically @xcite .",
    "an effective hamiltonian approach to the strongly trimerized kagom lattice @xcite was then successful in explaining the unusual properties of the homogeneous lattice @xcite .",
    "interest in this situation has been renewed recently due to the suggestion that strongly trimerized kagom lattices can be realized by fermionic quantum gases in optical lattices @xcite . for two fermions per triangle ,",
    "one obtains the aforementioned effective hamiltonian on a triangular lattice @xcite , but without the original magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "this effective hamiltonian also describes the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the trimerized kagom lattice at one third of the saturation magnetization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this model shares some features with pure orbital models on the square lattice @xcite , but it is substantially more frustrated than these models .",
    "numerical studies of the effective quantum hamiltonian @xcite provide evidence for an ordered groundstate and a possible finite - temperature ordering transition .",
    "since the hamiltonian only has discrete symmetries , one expects indeed a finite - temperature phase transition if the groundstate is ordered .",
    "furthermore , quantum fluctuations should be unimportant for the generic properties of such a phase transition , which motivates us to study the classical counterpart of the model at finite temperatures .",
    "entering the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) . [",
    "fig : latham ] ]    in this paper we study a hamiltonian which is given in terms of spins @xmath1 by @xmath2 the sum runs over the bonds of nearest neighbours @xmath3 of a triangular lattice with @xmath4 sites . for each bond ,",
    "only certain projections of the spins @xmath1 on unit vectors @xmath5 enter the interaction .",
    "these directions are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : latham ] . note that these directions depend both on the bond @xmath3 and the corresponding end @xmath6 or @xmath7 such",
    "that three different projections of each spin @xmath1 enter the interaction with its six nearest neighbours .    in the derivation from the trimerized kagom lattice @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 are pseudo - spin operators acting on the two chiralities on each triangle and should therefore be considered as quantum spin-1/2 operators . here",
    "we will treat the @xmath1 as classical unit vectors .",
    "since only the @xmath8- and @xmath9-components enter the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) , one may take the @xmath1 as ` planar ' two - component vectors .",
    "on the other hand , in the quantum case commutation relations dictate the presence of the @xmath10-component as well , such that taking the @xmath1 as ` spherical ' three - component vectors is another natural choice @xcite . here",
    "we will compare both choices and thus assess qualitatively the effect of omitting the @xmath10-components .",
    "the internal symmetries of the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) constitute the dihedral group @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the symmetry group of a regular hexagon",
    ". some of its elements consist of a simultaneous transformation of the spins @xmath1 and the lattice @xcite .",
    "since these symmetries are only discrete , a finite - temperature phase transition is allowed above an ordered groundstate .",
    "the derivation from a spin model @xcite yields a positive @xmath12 , while it may also be possible to realize @xmath13 @xcite in a fermi gas in an optical lattice @xcite . in the following",
    "we will first discuss the case of a negative exchange constant @xmath13 and then turn to the case of a positive exchange constant @xmath12 .",
    "the second case is more interesting , but also turns out to be more difficult to handle .",
    "for @xmath13 there is a one - parameter family of ordered groundstates , @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the three sublattices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively ( @xmath21 nel order ) .",
    "the energy of these states , @xmath22 , is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "computing the free energy @xmath24 by including the effect of gaussian fluctuations we find that @xmath24 has minima at @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the above @xmath21 nel structures lock in at these angles .    , @xmath27 , and planar spins .",
    "( a ) snapshot of a configuration on a @xmath28 lattice .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed at the edges .",
    "( b ) histogram of angles @xmath29 , averaged over 1000 configurations .",
    "[ fig : cfgneg ] ]    we have performed monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations for @xmath13 using a standard single - spin flip metropolis algorithm @xcite . a snapshot of a low - temperature configuration on an @xmath30 lattice is shown in fig .  [ fig : cfgneg](a ) .",
    "the @xmath21 ordering is clearly seen in such snapshots .",
    "[ fig : cfgneg](b ) shows histograms of the angles @xmath29 .",
    "one observes that with increasing lattice size @xmath4 , pronounced maxima emerge in the probability @xmath31 to observe an angle @xmath29 at the predicted lock - in values @xmath25 .",
    "thermodynamic quantities have been computed by averaging over at least 100 independent mc simulations .",
    "each simulation was started at high temperatures and slowly cooled to lower temperatures in order to minimize equilibration times . a first quantity , namely the specific heat @xmath32 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cneg ] .",
    "there is a maximum in @xmath32 at @xmath33 for spherical spins , and for planar spins at a higher temperature @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath32 around the maximum increases with @xmath4 indicates a phase transition . for @xmath35 , the equipartition theorem predicts a contribution @xmath36 to the specific heat per transverse degree of freedom .",
    "indeed , the low - temperature results are very close to @xmath37 and @xmath38 for planar and spherical spins , respectively .    in order to quantify the expected order ,",
    "we introduce the sublattice order parameter @xmath39 where the sum runs over one of the three sublattices @xmath40 of the triangular lattice .",
    "[ fig : mneg ] plots the square of this sublattice order parameter @xmath41 which is a scalar quantity and expected to be non - zero in a three - sublattice ordered state .",
    "note , however , that the order parameter ( [ defmsubl ] ) is insensitive to the mutual orientation of spins on the three sublattices . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mneg ] we observe that @xmath42 converges to zero with @xmath43 at high temperatures , while a non - zero value persists at lower temperatures , consistent with a phase transition around @xmath44 , as already indicated by the specific heat .",
    "furthermore , the sublattice order again points to a higher transition temperature for planar spins than for spherical spins .",
    "it should also be noted that there are noticeable quantitative differences between the values of @xmath42 for planar and spherical spins over the entire temperature range .",
    "just for @xmath35 both planar and spherical spins yield @xmath45 , as expected for a perfectly ordered groundstate .    in order to determine the transition temperature @xmath46 more accurately",
    ", we use the ` binder cumulant ' @xcite associated to the order parameter ( [ defmsubl ] ) via @xmath47 the constants in ( [ defbinder ] ) are chosen such that @xmath48 for a gaussian distribution of the order parameter @xmath49 .",
    "such a distribution is expected at high temperatures , leading to @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , a perfectly ordered state yields @xmath52 such that with the prefactors as in ( [ defbinder ] ) we find @xmath53 .",
    "hence , for an ordered state we expect @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig : uneg ] shows our results for the binder cumulant , as defined in ( [ defbinder ] ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath46 can be estimated from the crossings of the binder cumulants at different sizes @xmath4 @xcite , which are shown for planar spins in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : uneg ] .",
    "since we have not been aiming at high precision , we can not perform a finite - size extrapolation .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain a rough estimate @xmath56 with an error on the order of a few percent .",
    "the corresponding value for spherical spins is estimated as @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that out - of - plane fluctuations reduce @xmath46 by about @xmath58 .",
    "as in the case @xmath13 , there is a one - parameter family of @xmath21 nel ordered groundstates with energy @xmath59 .",
    "they differ from the states found for @xmath13 by an interchange of the spin directions on the @xmath19- and @xmath20-sublattices .",
    "the contribution of gaussian fluctuations around these states yields a free energy @xmath60 which has minima at @xmath61 , @xmath26 .",
    "hence the nel structure locks in at these angles for @xmath12 .",
    "surprisingly , an inspection of all states of finite cells of the lattice , in which the mutual angles between pairs of spins are multiples of @xmath62 @xcite , reveals that there is a macroscopic number of groundstates in addition to the @xmath21 nel states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of ground states grows exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath21 nel state has @xmath63 soft modes , all other groundstates have fewer soft modes @xcite . at low but finite temperatures the @xmath21 nel state",
    "will therefore be selected by a thermal order - by - disorder mechanism @xcite .",
    "the large number of groundstates which are separated by an energy barrier renders it extremely difficult to thermalize a simple mc simulation at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "we have therefore performed exchange mc simulations ( also known as ` parallel tempering ' ) @xcite for @xmath12 , using a parallel implementation based on mpi .",
    "96 replicas were distributed over the temperature range @xmath64 in a manner to ensure an acceptance rate for exchange moves of at least 70% .",
    "statistical analysis was performed by binning the time series at each temperature .",
    "[ fig : cfgpos ] shows snapshots of two low - temperature configurations with @xmath30 generated by the exchange method with planar spins .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath13 , it is difficult to decide on the basis of such snapshots if any order arises for @xmath12 : there are definitely large fluctuations including domain walls in the system",
    ". these fluctuations are in fact a necessary ingredient of the order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "a careful quantitative analysis is therefore clearly needed .",
    "we start with the specific heat @xmath32 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpos ] .",
    "there is a broad maximum at @xmath65 for planar spins and @xmath66 for spherical spins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cpos](a ) ) .",
    "however , this maximum does not correspond to a phase transition , as one can infer from the small finite - size effects .",
    "there is a second small peak in @xmath32 at a lower temperature @xmath67 , see panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig.[fig : cpos ] .",
    "since this peak increases with @xmath4 , it is consistent with a phase transition .",
    "note that at the lowest temperatures @xmath68 is clearly smaller than @xmath36 and @xmath38 for planar and spherical spins , respectively .",
    "indeed , in - plane fluctuations around the @xmath69 state yield",
    "one branch of soft modes , which we expect to contribute only @xmath70 to @xmath32 rather than @xmath71 , as the other two branches .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath72 for planar spins and @xmath73 for spherical spins in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "our mc results tend in this direction , but we have not reached sufficiently low temperatures to fully verify this prediction .",
    "lastly , we note that the difference between @xmath68 for planar and spherical spins is consistent with @xmath36 within error bars only for @xmath74 .    next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpos ] we show the square of the sublattice magnetization ( [ defms ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "first , we observe that it remains small for almost all temperatures and shoots up just at the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : mpos ] where we measure a maximal value of @xmath75 for @xmath76 on the @xmath77 lattice .",
    "this is consistent with a phase transition into a three - sublattice ordered state in the vicinity of the low - temperature peak in the specific heat @xmath32 . in marked difference with the case",
    "@xmath13 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mneg ] ) , here we observe only small differences between planar and spherical spins ( at least for the sizes where we have data for planar spins , _ i.e. _ , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : upos ] shows our results for the binder cumulant , as defined in ( [ defbinder ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the sublattice magnetization @xmath42 , the binder cumulants for planar and spherical spins are close to each other only for @xmath81 , provided we scale to the same prefactor @xmath82 in the definition ( [ defbinder ] ) .",
    "again , our best estimate for the transition temperature @xmath46 is obtained from the crossings of the binder cumulants at different sizes @xmath4 shown for planar spins in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : upos ] .",
    "the only meaningful crossings are those of the @xmath78 with the @xmath83 and @xmath80 curves , respectively .",
    "this leads to a rough estimate @xmath84 this estimate is indistinguishable from the corresponding value for spherical spins @xcite , as is expected since the spins lie essentially all in the @xmath8-@xmath9-plane for such low temperatures .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated finite - temperature properties of the classical version of the hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) on a triangular lattice .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "we have clear evidence for a low - temperature phase with @xmath69 nel order .",
    "the transition temperature is of order @xmath85 and can be determined with reasonable accuracy .",
    "planar and spherical spins yield qualitatively similar results , but there are quantitative differences , in particular the transition temperature ( [ tcnegplanar ] ) is higher for planar spins .",
    "we have performed further simulations for spherical spins @xcite in order to determine critical properties . on the one hand , so far we have no evidence for a discontinuity at @xmath46 , on the other hand the assumption of a continuous phase transition yields very unusual critical exponents @xcite which violate the hyperscaling relation .",
    "thus , the most plausible scenario may be a weakly first - order transition .    for @xmath12",
    ", the groundstates are macroscopically degenerate @xcite .",
    "a thermal order - by - disorder mechanism @xcite predicts the selection of another @xmath69 ordered state .",
    "the corresponding phase transition is just at the limits of detectability even with the exchange mc method @xcite : we find an extremely low transition temperature ( [ tcposplanar ] ) which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the overall energy scale @xmath86 . in this case , the spins lie essentially in the @xmath8-@xmath9-plane in the relevant temperature region such that we obtain quantitatively extremely close results for planar and spherical spins in the vicinity of @xmath46 , apart from a constant offset in the specific heat .",
    "the features observed e.g.  in the specific heat for the classical variant resemble those found in the original quantum model @xcite . since only much smaller systems are numerically accessible for the quantum model , the results for the classical variant are an important tool for understanding the quantum case",
    ". in particular , the finite - temperature phase transitions should be universal and may therefore be characterized in the classical model . however , highly accurate data is needed for that purpose .",
    "our result that spherical and planar spins exhibit the same qualitative features for @xmath13 , and that for @xmath12 the @xmath10-component is even quantitatively very small in the relevant temperature range , may be useful in this context .",
    "namely , one may choose planar spins for further simulations , thus reducing the number of degrees of freedom to be updated .",
