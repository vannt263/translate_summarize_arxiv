    "galaxies form from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , process such gas into stars , and possibly re - eject a fraction of it , enriched by nucleosynthetic products , back into the intergalactic space via powerful supernova - driven outflows ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ; ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ; madau , ferrara & rees 2001 ; scannapieco , ferrara & madau 2002 ; theuns 2002 ) . the energy deposition connected to these processes",
    "is expected to leave at least some detectable imprints on the physical state of the igm .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that such signatures can be studied through qso absorption line experiments .",
    "naively , the presence of hot outflowing gas should result primarily in two effects : [ i ] a decrease of the gas density and [ ii ] an increase of the temperature caused by shock - heating ( acting in conjunction with photo - heating by the uv background ) in a large ( several hundreds kpc ) region around the perturbing galaxy .",
    "both these occurrences would imply an increasingly more transparent ly@xmath2 forest when approaching the galaxy , a galactic proximity effect .",
    "quantitative confirmation of this scenario has faced tremendous difficulties , standing the complications of the physics of star formation , explosions and metal mixing in multiphase media . hence , most simulations to date had to rely on _ ad hoc _ recipes for such processes .",
    "+ nevertheless , these ideas have stimulated the first challenging observations aimed at detecting the imprints of galaxy - igm interplay .",
    "adelberger ( 2002 , a02 ) obtained high resolution spectra of 8 bright qsos at @xmath3 and spectroscopic redshifts for 431 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at lower redshifts . by comparing the positions of the lbgs with the ly@xmath2 absorption lines in qso spectra ,",
    "indeed they conclude that within @xmath4 ( comoving ) mpc of the galaxies little is present ; on the contrary , between 1 and 5@xmath0 mpc an excess with respect to the igm mean is detected .",
    "this simple interpretation might be at odd with the results of a vlt / uves study of the forest in the vicinity of the lbg ms1512-cb58 showing the opposite trend ( savaglio 2002 ) , an absorption excess close to the galaxy . + numerical simulations have also noticeable difficulties reproducing a02 results as discussed by croft ( 2002 ) and kollmeier ( 2002 ) ; however , these studies lack a self - consistent treatment of multiphase gas structure and/or outflow dynamics . here",
    "we revisit a02 results through sph simulations ( marri 2003 ) that implement a new scheme for multiphase hydrodynamics and , more importantly , a physically meaningful outflow treatment ; the full description of the code and of the tests made are given in marri & white ( 2002 ) .",
    "we then derive synthetic absorption line spectra along lines of sight randomly traced through the simulation box at @xmath5 and compare them directly with a02 data to investigate galactic feedback effects on the igm .",
    "we have performed hydrodynamic simulations for a @xmath6cdm cosmological model with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the initial power spectrum is cluster - normalized ( @xmath12 ) ; periodic boundary conditions are adopted .",
    "we first obtained a set of low - resolution runs ( @xmath13 particles for both gas and dark matter ) in a @xmath14 comoving mpc cube ; these runs serve as a guide for more computationally expensive runs and for testing purposes .",
    "we consider a first model where the igm multiphase structure and galaxy outflows are deliberately ignored and a second one which includes a description of both these physical effects .",
    "we will refer to these runs as and , respectively , with the same meaning ( and parameters ) adopted in the description of the low - resolution @xmath6cdm test problem described in marri & white ( 2002 ) .",
    "the high - resolution run , on which the main results of the present analysis are based , is a @xmath15 particles simulation in a @xmath16 comoving mpc box . for this run",
    "we only studied the full model .",
    "+ softening lenghts are fixed both in physical and comoving coordinates as required in gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) .",
    "gas ( dark matter ) gravitational softening is approximately @xmath17  kpc ( @xmath18  kpc ) comoving and @xmath19  kpc ( @xmath20  kpc ) physical in the high - res case and scales according to particle number and box size in the low - res run . in all runs",
    "we include the effects of a uv background produced by qsos and filtered through the igm , whose shape and amplitude are taken from haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .      to allow a direct comparison of simulation results with observational data we construct synthetic spectra from simulation outputs at redshift @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for the low - res ( high - res ) runs .",
    "in the simulation box we randomly trace 60 lines - of - sight ( los ) parallel to the @xmath23-axis , each of which is discretized into @xmath24 pixels . in order to assign to each pixel a value for the hydrogen density , temperature and peculiar velocity",
    "we perform a standard sph smoothing using the 32 closest neighbour sph particles to the los pixel position .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density is derived using the code cloudy94 on each pixel , adopting the same uvb as in the simulation .",
    "the transmitted flux due to ly@xmath2 absorption in the igm is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the optical depth along the considered los .",
    "the hubble velocity @xmath27 varies in the range ( 0,@xmath28 ) , where the maximum value is set by the box size .",
    "the contribution to @xmath26 at the observed frequency corresponding to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the pixel index , is given by @xmath31=\\frac{\\delta x \\sigma_{0}f\\lambda_{0}}{\\pi^{1/2 } } \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{pix}}\\frac { n_{\\nhi}(i ) } { { b(i)}}\\phi_{g}[v_{h}(k)-v(i ) ] , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the pixel size , @xmath33 is the ly@xmath2 cross section , @xmath34 is the ly@xmath2 oscillator strength , @xmath35 is the ly@xmath2 wavelength , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number density , the doppler parameter , and the total velocity in the pixel @xmath38 , respectively ; @xmath39 is a gaussian line profile and @xmath40 is the peculiar velocity . for additional discussion on this formula , see rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ( 1997a ) .",
    "+ to compare observations and simulations at best it is necessary to degrade the synthetic spectra to account for the uncertainties affecting the observed spectra .",
    "we perform such procedure through the following steps : _ i _ ) continuum normalization at the highest flux value in each spectrum ; _ ii _ ) convolution with the instrumental profile ; _ iii _ ) sampling due to spectrograph spatial resolution ; _ iv _ ) addition of instrumental noise ( see rauch 1997b ; theuns 1998 ; mcdonald 2000 ; petry 2002 ) . as most of the data we compare with",
    "are taken with the keck / hires spectrograph we adopt the following instrumental characteristics : fwhm @xmath41 km s@xmath11 , pixel spectral resolution @xmath42   and signal - to - noise ratio s / n=50 . the low ( high ) resolution box has a wavelength extent of @xmath43   ( @xmath44 ) ; hence , degraded spectra in the two cases are made of 269 and 417 pixels , respectively .",
    "as a general sanity check of the simulations we have first confronted the simulated statistical properties of the ly@xmath2 forest with the observed ones .",
    "the most obvious comparison involves the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the transmitted flux . in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the pdf as a function of the flux @xmath45 for the low - res ( both and runs ) and high - res simulations ( case only ) and compare them with the observational data of mcdonald ( 2000 ) .",
    "the general agreement is quite good through all the flux range and for all three cases .",
    "the discrepancy between simulations and data at high fluxes is probably due to the uncertainties in the data continuum fitting ( mcdonald 2000 ; croft 2002 ) .",
    "surprisingly , it appears that the inclusion of multiphase and outflow physics , not considered in the pure run , does not affect the distribution in a sensible manner . in other words ,",
    "galactic outflows leave the forest unperturbed .",
    "this result is in agreement with that recently found by theuns ( 2002 ) , who interpreted it as an indication that galactic outflows tend to propagate preferentially in the voids leaving the absorbing filaments virtually unaffected . as an additional check we have calculated the doppler parameter , @xmath46 , and the column density distribution , and compared them with two qsos observations at @xmath47 and @xmath48 by hu ( 1995 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath49 for each absorber in the synthetic spectra have been derived using the fitting programm autovp .",
    "the experimental @xmath46 distribution is well reproduced both by the and ( low - res + high - res ) runs at similar quality level ( simulated and observed distributions peak both around @xmath50  km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "however , simulated spectra tend to slightly overproduce lines with @xmath51  km  s@xmath11 and under - predict lines with @xmath52  km  s@xmath11 . a similar effect",
    "has already been noted by theuns ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors propose a number of possible explanations for this behavior : physical ( reionization , radiative transfer effects ) , numerical ( resolution ) and related to data analysis ( fitting procedure ) .",
    "our results seem to indicate that numerical artifacts should not be the dominant factor . as for the column density distribution ,",
    "the case seems to reproduce the observational data for @xmath53 somewhat better ; for smaller values of @xmath49 the differences between the two runs are negligible .",
    "+    in fig.[fig2 ] we show a temperature map from a slice through the high - res box at @xmath22 .",
    "hot bubbles ( @xmath54  k ) of shocked gas produced by outflows around the parent galaxies are clearly apparent .",
    "their sizes range from @xmath55 mpc @xmath0 to @xmath1 mpc @xmath0 , and their shape appears in some case rather jagged as a result of the interaction with the inhomogeneous ambient medium .",
    "the volume filling factor of gas with temperature above @xmath56  k is 14% .",
    "the internal structure of the bubbles can be inspected more quantitatively in fig.[fig3 ] , where the comparison between and is shown ( low - res case ) for various physical quantities ( hydrogen density , @xmath57 , ionization fraction , @xmath58 , gas temperature , t , and peculiar velocity , @xmath40 ) along the los through the center of the most massive galaxy @xmath59 in these simulations ; the galaxy position corresponds to the density peak at @xmath60  mpc  @xmath0 . in both simulations",
    "the star formation rate in this galaxy is 5.6 @xmath61 ( 18 @xmath62 ) for the ( ) models . a striking result of the comparison between the two models shows that , although outflows are able to heat the halo / igm gas up to high temperatures out to more than 1 mpc  @xmath0 from the galaxy , they do not seem able to modify its density structure in a sensible way .",
    "hence the density in the surroundings remains high and close to that set up by the process of galaxy formation .",
    "close to the galactic center the outflow peak speed is about @xmath63  km  s@xmath11 , but this value rapidly decreases as kinetic energy is used to counteract the pressure of intergalactic accreting gas , raining onto the galaxy at essentially the escape speed of the system , roughly @xmath64  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the stalling radius is seen at the zero - crossing of @xmath40 , approximately 0.3  mpc  @xmath0 away from the outflow source .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the density to the sn energy injection can be interpreted as the fact that the outflow velocities are lower than the escape speeds and hence the flow is confined by inflow .",
    "also , we note that the outflow velocities we find are lower than those inferred by a02 , @xmath65 km s@xmath11 from lbgs .",
    "+ fig.[fig4 ] shows the mean ly@xmath2 forest flux averaged on pixels on different los at different distances , @xmath66 , from the galaxy centers in the simulation box , following the same experimental procedure as in a02 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of pixels that fall in the bin @xmath66 , and @xmath69 is the transmitted flux in the pixel @xmath38 .",
    "the synthetic data , normalized to the observational ones , are plotted only out to a distance @xmath70  mpc  @xmath0 for the low - res simulations ( @xmath71  mpc  @xmath0 for high - res one ) due to the periodic boundary conditions of the simulation .",
    "we first compare the two low - res and cases .",
    "the difference between these curves is negligible and on average the ly@xmath2 absorption is similar : this is expected after the results analyzed in fig .",
    "in addition both simulations are in agreement with the high - res one , thus ensuring that numerical convergence has been reached and results are not affected by spurious effects .",
    "however , these models fail in reproducing the observed trend inside 1 mpc  @xmath0 .",
    "the simulated forest seems to be much more opaque than the observed one , with a maximum @xmath26 discrepancy of about a factor 2.2 . in order to assess",
    "if the disagreement could be reduced by a more efficient outflow clearing of the halos of smaller systems , we excluded the contribution of most massive galaxies ( @xmath72 ) to the flux .",
    "however , as it is seen from the figure , this does not solve the problem . as a final resort",
    ", we have randomized the position of galaxy centers in the box to account for the reported experimental error determination .",
    "to this aim we have added a gaussian random displacement to the redshift of each galaxy with r.m.s .",
    "@xmath73 , which represents the 1-@xmath74 error of the measure .",
    "this procedure improves the result , as now galaxy centers do not perfectly coincide with density peaks , but to an extent insufficient to explain the data .",
    "motivated by the recent observational results of a02 , we have studied , with the help of a set of cosmological simulations including star formation in multiphase gas and outflows from galaxies , the effects of galaxy formation / activity on the properties of the surrounding forest .",
    "although on large scales our simulations can reproduce remarkably well a number of statistical properties of the igm , they fail to predict the observed flux increase in regions close to the galaxies themselves",
    ". the success can be ascertain to two concomitant effects : ( i ) outflows preferentially expand in regions of low - density ( voids ) thus preserving the filaments responsible for the absorbing network ; ( ii ) the hot bubbles fill a relatively small fraction of the cosmic volume ( @xmath75% in our simulations ) .",
    "support to the first hypothesis emerges also from an inspection of the velocity field in the surrounding of the most massive galaxy in the simulation : the inflow of gas from low density regions is blocked by the bubble expansion , but it proceeds basically unimpeded along the filaments ( see marri 2003 ) .",
    "+ much more puzzling is instead the reason for the opacity excess ( with respect to real data ) we see in the simulation in the inner mpc  @xmath0 .",
    "apparently , simulated outflows do not carry sufficient momentum to disperse the density peak created in the vicinity of the galaxy as a leftover of its formation .",
    "also , a large fraction of the outflow energy is used to counteract the infalling gas ram pressure which tends to pile up the gas into the galaxy . the temperature increase close to galaxies",
    "amplifies the magnitude of the collisional ionization rate , which becomes larger than the equivalent photoionization rate for @xmath76  k. in this case the neutral fraction @xmath58 is independent of gas density and remains at roughly the same level as in the general igm .",
    "therefore , collisional ionization is not sufficient to balance the opacity increase induced by the density raise and the transmitted flux drops accordingly to the latter .",
    "what are the possible alternative explanations for the observed flux trend ?",
    "the presence of a bias in the data produced by a preferential selection effect of low absorption lbgs has already been suggested by croft ( 2002 ) .",
    "another possibility is provided by photoionization , particularly if one recalls the recent results by steidel , pettini & adelberger ( 2001 ) , who detected flux beyond the lyman limit ( with significant residual flux at @xmath77   ) in a composite spectrum of 29 lbgs at @xmath78 , a clue of a conspicuous escape probability of ionizing radiation from these objects . as mentioned above , the a02 data would require an optical depth ( or equivalently a @xmath58 , assuming a prescribed density profile ) a factor @xmath79 smaller .",
    "if this can be achieved with the ionizing flux coming from galaxies must be proved with detailed radiative transfer calculations which are currently ongoing ( maselli 2003 ) the first attempt using simplified analytical and/or post - processing techniques to account for this effect ( croft 2002 , kollmeier 2002 ) have yielded so far negative answers , but a fully self - consistent , physically accurate description of the problem is awaited in order to draw a final conclusion .",
