    "it is now widely recognized that non - gaussianity is a useful tool to distinguish between various models for the primordial perturbation .",
    "although the power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations are well constrained by current observations such as wmap @xcite , at linear order many mechanisms can give rise to almost the same spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "thus , to differentiate between models , one needs to go beyond the linear order .",
    "for example , the standard slow - roll inflation models predict an almost gaussian primordial perturbation , while other mechanism such as the curvaton @xcite , yield almost identical power spectrum but can have a significant non - gaussian component .",
    "the deviations from the purely gaussian perturbation are usually characterized by some non - linearity parameters , such as @xmath0 , related to the 3-point function , and @xmath10 and @xmath2 , which are related to the 4-point function .",
    "the present observational constraint on @xmath0 is @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath2 , see @xcite and for forecasts on future constraints see @xcite . ] .",
    "if taken at face value , the current limit might actually suggest that @xmath0 deviates from zero ( although it is still consistent with zero ) ; this might spell trouble for the standard single - field slow - roll inflation models , which typically give @xmath0 which is proportional to the small slow - roll parameters , or at most @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if this suggestion turns out to be confirmed by planck , the curvaton models would be natural candidates for the primordial perturbation .",
    "indeed , non - gaussianity in the curvaton model has been the subject of extensive study @xcite .",
    "however , in the majority of these studies the curvaton potential is assumed to be of the quadratic form .",
    "since in order to be able to decay , the curvaton has to couple to some other fields , it then follows that through loop corrections there will also appear some effective curvaton self - couplings , even if they were absent at tree level .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out that even small deviations from the quadratic potential may have significant effects for the primordial perturbation if due to the curvaton @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that for non - quadratic curvaton potentials the predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 can be quite different as compared with the purely quadratic case @xcite . in the presence of non - linearities , it is also possible that the non - gaussianity of the perturbation can be revealed by @xmath2 ( or the 4-point function ) rather than by @xmath0 , which by virtue of the non - linearites can remain very small for certain choices of the parameters @xcite .",
    "another point worth stressing is that the well - known relation @xmath13 for the curvaton model , where @xmath14 is related to the curvaton fraction of the total energy density at the time of curvaton decay , is not generic and strictly speaking only true for the quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "thus a general , self - interacting curvaton model is a source for new observational signatures .",
    "however , self - interaction means also more free parameters .",
    "hence it would be desirable to have more observational quantities beyond @xmath15 and @xmath2 that would help to constrain the models .    indeed , recently it has been pointed out that the scale - dependence of @xmath15 could be measured by future observations @xcite .",
    "theoretical aspects of the scale - dependence have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "we note that the scale dependence of equilateral type non - gaussianity is also of interest @xcite . here",
    "we study the scale - dependence of the non - gaussianity parameters in a self - interacting curvaton model .",
    "we show that , in some cases , the scale - dependence of @xmath0 can be large enough to be detected in future observations .",
    "we also demonstrate that by using the combined information about @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we may essentially fix the curvaton model parameters .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we summarize the formalism for the study of the scale - dependence of @xmath0 , which manifests itself in the spectral index @xmath1 , in a general curvaton model .",
    "then in section  [ sec : results ] , we closely look at @xmath1 in various cases and discuss its detectability in future observations . we also discuss the implications for @xmath2 , in particular focusing on the complementary nature of the combined information .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and a discussion about the implications of the results .",
    "for the purpose of discussing the scale - dependence of non - gaussianity parameters in the curvaton model , let us assume that the potential for the curvaton @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the curvaton , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the strength and the power of the self - coupling , respectively . to characterize the relative size of the self - interaction term in the potential",
    ", we define the parameter @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22 where the subscript @xmath23 represents that the quantity is evaluated at the time the scale leaves the horizon .",
    "thus @xmath21 is the ratio of two terms in eq .   at the horizon exit .",
    "once the curvaton begins to oscillate , the energy density of the curvaton can soon be well described by the purely quadratic case ( i.e. , the  nearly \" quadratic case discussed in @xcite ) , the curvature perturbation up to the third order , adopting sudden decay approximation , can be written as @xmath24 \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma'_{\\rm osc}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } } \\right)^2   ( \\delta \\sigma_\\ast ) ^2 \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{4}{81 } \\left [ \\frac{9r_{\\rm dec}}{4 }   \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^2 \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime } } { \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 3 } } + 3\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 2 } } \\right ) -9r_{\\rm dec}^2 \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 2 } } \\right ) \\right . \\notag \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "the non - linearity parameter @xmath0 is then given by @xmath28    let us now discuss the scale dependence of @xmath0 in the self - interacting curvaton model .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath0 is defined as ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath29 where we regard @xmath1 as the spectral index for @xmath15 . from this definition , treating @xmath1 as a constant is equivalent to assuming the power - law form : @xmath30    for the self - interacting curvaton model , the spectral index can be calculated as @xcite ( for a very recent , alternative method of calculation see @xcite ) @xmath31^{-1 }   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\frac{v^{\\prime\\prime\\prime } ( \\sigma_\\ast)}{3 h_\\ast^2 } \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}}{\\sigma'_{\\rm osc } } \\frac{5}{4 r_{\\rm dec } f_{\\rm nl}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to the spectral index @xmath1 , the running of @xmath1 can also be defined analogously to the running of the spectral index of the usual spectrum as @xmath34 for the curvaton model with self - interaction , we obtain the following expression for the running @xmath35 : @xmath36 - n_{f_{\\rm nl}}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the derivative of the potential can be evaluated once @xmath37 , and the mass @xmath18 are given .",
    "however , in the following discussion , instead of the mass we find it convenient to use the parameter @xmath38 , defined as the ratio between @xmath39 and the hubble parameter during inflation : @xmath40 notice that the spectral index for the power spectrum in this model is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the slow - roll parameter for the inflaton sector .",
    "thus the value of @xmath38 should be small enough to be consistent with the observational constraint : @xmath43 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite .    with the definition ( [ defeta ] ) for @xmath38",
    ", we can express the higher derivatives of the potential as @xmath44    it should be noticed here that , in the self - interacting curvaton model , the value of @xmath0 can change its sign when parameters are varied .",
    "in fact , when @xmath0 changes its sign , the scale - dependence of @xmath0 can not be well described by the power - law form of eq .  .",
    "one could also see this by noticing that the expression of @xmath1 given by eq",
    ".   diverges when @xmath45 .",
    "however , as we will discuss later , when @xmath0 is small enough , it would be impossible to measure the scale - dependence of @xmath0 ; for small enough @xmath0 , it is not an observable .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the magnitude of the running @xmath35 is much smaller than @xmath1 except in the region where @xmath46 . in the following",
    "we do not consider the unobservable region @xmath47 ; as a consequence , for us @xmath48 is indeed the proper way to describe scale - dependence of @xmath0 in the whole range of interest .",
    "although in this paper we mainly focus on the scale - dependence of @xmath0 , we can also define the scale dependence of @xmath2 similarly to the case of @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath49 since in the curvaton model with a self - interaction term , the non - linearity parameter @xmath2 is given by @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the case for @xmath1 , a similar calculation ( consistent with the results of @xcite ) yields @xmath51 : @xmath52 \\notag \\\\   & &   \\times \\left [ \\frac{9}{4 }   \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^2 \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime } } { \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 3 } } + 3\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 2 } } \\right ) -9r_{\\rm dec } \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 2 } } \\right ) + \\frac{r_{\\rm dec}^2}{2 } \\left ( 1 - 9 \\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm osc } \\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\sigma_{\\rm osc}^{\\prime 2 } } \\right ) + 10 r_{\\rm dec}^3 + 3 r_{\\rm dec}^4 \\right]^{-1}. \\notag \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath0 are also shown in the right panel .",
    "we have chosen the value of @xmath14 such that we obtain @xmath56 at @xmath57 for each relative self - interaction strength @xmath21 ( therefore the values of @xmath14 are different for each case ) . as discussed in the previous section , when @xmath0 very small , with @xmath47 , the power - law form can not well describe the scale dependence of @xmath0 . to emphasize this fact we cut out the regions with @xmath58 .    according to @xcite , future observations such as cmbpol may be able to detect the scale dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the observational error has been estimated as ( for the fiducial value of @xmath59 ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fraction of the sky measured .",
    "hence in the parameter space where the theoretical estimate @xmath62 we may be able to constrain the self - interacting curvaton model by the scale dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "for example , as can be read off from figure [ fig : n6_8 ] , when @xmath57 and @xmath63 , the spectral index is @xmath64 , which should be observable with future observations .    to chart the parameter space where @xmath1 is a useful tool for model building , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : n6_8 ] the contours of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the @xmath21@xmath14 plane for the cases of @xmath57 and @xmath65 . from the expression of eq .",
    ", one can see that while generally @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath66 , in the self - interacting curvaton model @xmath0 also depends on @xmath21 through the non - linear evolution of the curvaton field .",
    "this is encoded in @xmath67 and its derivatives . on the other hand , when @xmath14 is small , @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath68 but strongly depends on @xmath21 .",
    "since the scale - dependence of @xmath0 mainly originates from the non - linear evolution of @xmath16 due to the higher order term in the potential , the value of @xmath21 controls @xmath1 . notice that , when @xmath69 , the sign of @xmath0 is determined by the factor @xmath70 which appears in the first term in eq .  .",
    "this factor depends on @xmath21 and @xmath20 , but not on @xmath14 .",
    "this is the reason why the contours of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n6_8 ] appear to converge at @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath57 and @xmath65 , respectively , where @xmath0 abruptly switches from a positive value to a negative one .",
    "the region around this line also corresponds to the breakdown of the power - law description for the scale - dependence . by cutting out the region with @xmath73 , which anyway is irrelevant from an observational viewpoint",
    ", we therefore guarantee that the power - law description is valid .    since the sensitivity of @xmath1 in future observations depends on the value of @xmath0 , as indicated in eq .",
    ", the self - interacting curvaton model may be tested in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : testable ] , where the regions with @xmath74 are shown for the cases @xmath75 and @xmath65 . here",
    "we conservatively adopt the range @xmath76 .",
    "if future observations find a non - zero value for @xmath1 , the self - interacting curvaton model must lie inside the colored regions .",
    "on the other hand , if no scale - dependence of @xmath0 will be detected , the colored region will be excluded .",
    "planck is expected to have about half of the sensitivity to @xmath1 compared to ( [ eq : nfnl_obs ] ) , but large scale structure probes may become even more sensitive to @xmath1 than cmbpol .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that @xmath1 can be a useful tool to probe / test the self - interacting curvaton model . however , even if we can observe @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the situation remains degenerate : different combinations of the power @xmath20 , the strength @xmath21 and @xmath14 can give the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to demonstrate this , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gnl ] , we plot @xmath48 as a function of @xmath0 , which is almost equivalent to the plot as a function of @xmath14 , for the cases of @xmath57 and @xmath65 . to give an example , by fixing @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath57 and @xmath65 , respectively , the lines for @xmath57 and @xmath65 almost coincide , as is shown in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : gnl ] .",
    "however , the predictions for @xmath2 are in general different .",
    "this is demonstrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gnl ] , where we show @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 for the same parameters as in the right panel .",
    "this figure indicates that , in principle , it is possible break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 by including @xmath2 in the analysis . thus combining together information about the bispectrum amplitude , the spectral index of the bispectrum , and the amplitude of the trispectrum , one may actually fix completely the parameters of the simplest self - interacting curvaton model ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath10 in this model does not give new information , since it satisfies @xmath79 ( for more discussion on the trispectrum see @xcite ) , but testing this consistency relation is still valuable since it can determine whether it was justified to neglect the the inflaton field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can also address the scale - dependence of @xmath80 ; the appropriate expression was already given in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngnl ] , @xmath51 is plotted as a function of the power @xmath20 for @xmath63 .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath51 becomes larger the smaller @xmath20 is .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of @xmath1 , which becomes smaller as the value of the power @xmath20 becomes smaller , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnl ] .",
    "thus , in future observations it may be possible to see the scale - dependence of @xmath2 even if we can not detect the scale - dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in addition to @xmath2 itself , the scale - dependence of @xmath2 might also provide a tool to probe / test the self - interacting curvaton model .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the scale dependence of the non - linear parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 in a curvaton model with a simple self - interaction term given by the potential ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the curvaton mass @xmath81 , the power of the self - interaction term @xmath20 , and its relative strength @xmath21 .",
    "the complete parametrization of the curvature perturbation would require also the knowledge of @xmath26 , determined by the inflaton sector . in principle @xmath26",
    "can be observationally fixed by a detection of primordial gravitational waves , but their amplitude is likely to be very small in the curvaton scenario . in a complete model , the curvaton decay rate might not be a totally independent parameter , but here we assume that , for a given @xmath26 , the decay rate can be tuned to yield the correct perturbation amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "in such a situation , as has been argued before , even a modest amount of non - linearity in the curvaton potential @xcite may lead to observable consequences .",
    "therefore , although @xmath82 is scale - invariant when the curvaton potential is quadratic , in many cases the spectral index @xmath1 of the bispectrum can be detectable when one includes the self - interaction term ; this fact is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfnl ] .",
    "since the observational sensitivity to the scale - dependence of @xmath0 depends on the magnitude of @xmath0 , there are regions where the self - interacting curvaton model parameters can be pinpointed by the observations of @xmath0 and its scale dependence @xmath1 .",
    "the testable domains in the parameter space are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : testable ] . if no scale - dependence of @xmath0 will be found , these regions",
    "would be excluded so that for the self - interacting curvaton model , the scale - dependence can indeed provide us with clear - cut evidence for or against the model .",
    "in addition to the scale - dependence of @xmath0 , we also studied the non - linearity parameter of the trispectrum , @xmath2 , and its scale - dependence @xmath51 . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnl ] , even though in principle there is a degeneracy in the space of model parameters in that a given pair of values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 is produced by several combinations of @xmath83 , the degeneracy can be broken by @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral index of @xmath2 could be used to probe the scale - dependence of non - gaussianity in the self - interacting curvaton model at least for some of the cases where @xmath1 is not observable .",
    "so far the studies of non - gaussianity in the curvaton and other models have focused on the non - linearity parameters @xmath84 and @xmath2 .",
    "here we have pointed out that the scale dependence could also provide a realistic and useful tool to test the models .",
    "in particular , we have argued that the self - interacting curvaton model parameters could actually be completely fixed by the combined observations of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and the spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the projected observational sensitivity of the latter appears in many cases to be much higher than would be required for verification of the theoretical estimates is of course encouraging .",
    "it also lends some hope for the expectation that the physical origin of the primordial perturbation can be determined in the not too distant future .",
