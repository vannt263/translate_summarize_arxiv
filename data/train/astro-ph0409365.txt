    "* ) , h@xmath2 @xcite , and x - ray observations @xcite . in particular , high - sensivity h@xmath0i@xmath1 observations of edge - on galaxies like ngc 891 @xcite and ugc 7321 @xcite reveal neutral gas emission up to large distances from the plane and show the presence of a vertical gradient in the gas rotation velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ rotcur.891 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the study of face - on galaxies has revealed the presence of vertical motions of neutral gas often associated with holes in the disk h@xmath0i@xmath1 distribution ( * ? ? ? * boomsma et al .",
    ", this conference ) .    clearly , the two major issues of the origin and of the dynamical state of the extra - planar gas are strictly related .",
    "for example , the halo gas could be the result of cosmological accretion ( i.e. , infall of extragalactic gas ; binney , this conference ) , or could have been ejected from the plane through a galactic fountain mechanism @xcite , or it could have had a mixed origin .",
    "one might expect different structural and kinematical configurations for these cases .",
    "here we focus on the problem of the dynamical state of the extraplanar gas .",
    "there are two `` extreme '' kinds of explanations for the extra - planar gas kinematics ( low rotation and vertical motions ) : the ballistic models and the fluid stationary models .",
    "ballistic models describe the gas as an inhomogeneous collection of clouds in ballistic motion , subjected only to the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "a well - known example of ballistic model is the galactic fountain , which describes how ionized gas is ejected from the galactic plane due to stellar winds and supernova explosions and then cools and falls back ballistically onto the disk @xcite .",
    "ballistic models are effective at explaining vertical motions of the cold ( h@xmath0i@xmath1 ) and warm ( h@xmath2 ) gas components . however , the observations indicate a considerable morphological and kinematical regularity of the extra - planar gas ( see , e.g. , the total h@xmath0i@xmath1 map of ngc 891 in @xcite @xcite and fig .  [ rotcur.891 ] here ) , which may be difficult to understand in the context of purely ballistic models ( see also *",
    "the observed regularity may be explained more satisfactorily in the context of fluid stationary models . in these models",
    ", the gas is taken to be a rotating fluid in stationary equilibrium , without motions along the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions ; all the thermodynamical quantities are therefore time - independent , and the galaxy gravitational field is balanced by the pressure gradient and the centrifugal force .",
    "until now , this approach has not been fully explored in all its possibilities , and only a few attempts have been made ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "here we present a short account of our approach and of its main advantages , while a full discussion will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the simplest fluid models are constructed by solving the stationary equations of hydrodynamics ( written in the standard cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) , under the assumptions that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( in other words , the system is in a state of _ permanent rotation _ ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density , the pressure and the angular velocity of the gas , and @xmath13 is the total gravitational potential of the system . owing to the axial simmetry ,",
    "all the physical variables are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 only .    a commonly adopted approach for the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.hydro ] ) is that based on the poincar - wavre theorem @xcite .",
    "according to this theorem , the effective gravitational _ field _ at the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq.hydro ] ) can be obtained from an effective _ potential _",
    "@xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 . in this case , the gas density , pressure , and temperature are all stratified on @xmath14 , the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 is necessarily barotropic [ i.e. , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . the last property , i.e. the so - called `` cylindrical rotation '' , is in clear disagreement with the observed vertical gradient of the extra - planar gas rotation velocity in spiral galaxies .",
    "thus , in standard applications , one fixes @xmath13 and the radial trend of @xmath18 ( thus fixing @xmath14 ) .",
    "then , one solves the equation @xmath19 for the density , with assigned boundary conditions and with specified @xmath20 ; for @xmath21 one recovers the standard ( barotropic ) hydrostatic equilibrium solutions .",
    "clearly , rotational velocities changing with @xmath4 are excluded here , and this would seem to argue against the fluid stationary approach .",
    "however , in the next section we will show that it is possible to construct _ baroclinic _ equilibrium solutions with a negative velocity gradient along @xmath4 : this approach is a simple application of a more general technique that will be presented by @xcite .",
    "note that baroclinic solutions have been studied before for problems ranging from geophysics to the theory of sunspots to galactic dynamics ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , isotropic , self - gravitating axysimmetric galaxy models can be interpreted as baroclinic fluid configurations , showing streaming velocities often decreasing with @xmath4 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "at variance with the standard approach , here we start by assuming a gas density distribution @xmath22 ( vanishing at infinity ) .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath23 , the first of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.hydro ] ) can be integrated to obtain the gas pressure @xmath24 in general , @xmath11 can not be expressed as a function of @xmath10 only , and so our system is barocline .",
    "its temperature distribution is obtained from the perfect gas equation of state , @xmath25 inserting eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) in the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.hydro ] ) and integrating by parts one obtains a remarkable `` commutator - like '' expression for the rotational velocity @xmath26 clearly , due to the baroclinic nature of the solution , the quantity @xmath27 will depend on @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , the construction of barocline solutions is not as easy as it appears : in fact , not all the density distributions produce _ physically acceptable _ solutions , that is solutions for which @xmath28 everywhere .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) we can state a few sufficient conditions that can be used as _ guidelines _ to choose the density distribution @xmath10 and to obtain physically acceptable solutions . from now on , for simplicity we assume that the gas is not self - gravitating .",
    "two sufficient conditions are the following :    * when the total potential is homeoidally stratified with axial ratio @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 ( as in binney s [ 1991 ] logarithmic potential and evans [ 1994 ] spheroidal potentials ) , if one assume a gas density distribution of the form @xmath31 a sufficient condition to have @xmath28 everywhere is @xmath32 in particular , the third condition requires the gas density distribution to be stratified on _ flatter _ homeoids than the equipotentials . * when the total potential is generated by a razor thin uniform disk , ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , a necessary and sufficient condition to obtain @xmath28 everywhere is @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , point @xmath35 suggests that if the stellar disk contribution to the total potential is dominant in the central regions , a `` sufficient condition '' to have physically acceptable solutions is to take a centrally depressed gas distribution .",
    "the physical reason for this condition is very simple .",
    "in fact , suppose to fix a generic @xmath22 distribution in a uniform ( vertical ) gravitational field .",
    "the gas distribution is not stratified on @xmath13 and so must be rotating . according to the second of eq .",
    "( [ eq.hydro ] ) this means that , at any fixed @xmath4 , the gas pressure must increase with @xmath3 .",
    "this request can be stated in terms of the gas column density @xmath36 .",
    "in fact from eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) it results that in a vertical gravitational field the square of the gas rotational velocity is just proportional to the radial gradient of the column density , that must be positive .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this trend is consistent with the observed h@xmath0i@xmath1 surface density distribution for several spiral galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as a simple application of baroclinic solutions we have attempted to reproduce the observed negative gradient of the rotational velocity of the extra - planar gas in ngc 891 . the model here should be considered exploratory , in the sense that we are not interested at reproducing perfectly the kinematical data , but only to provide a reasonable , physically acceptable model for the extraplanar gas , and to show that baroclinic solutions deserve deeper investigations in the context of the extra - planar gas kinematic .",
    "we consider a very simple galaxy model that consists of two components , namely a razor - thin exponential stellar disk @xmath37 and a logarithmic dark matter halo @xcite with constant asymptotic velocity @xmath38 @xmath39 the galaxy bulge is not considered here . in eqs .",
    "( [ phi.exp])-([phi.log ] ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the disk mass and scale radius , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the halo potential scale radius and flattening parameter , and @xmath44 is the @xmath45-th order bessel function of the first kind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following the simple criteria illustrated in points @xmath46 and @xmath35 , we adopted the trial function @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the central density , the radial and vertical scales of the gas distribution , and @xmath2 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are dimensionless constants . for @xmath53 ,",
    "( [ rho.gas ] ) describes a centrally depressed ( i.e. toroidal ) gas density distribution , and the exponential is a scale - height modulating function .",
    "note that the equations for this model must be solved numerically , and the description of the code will be given in @xcite .",
    "after a few attempts we fixed @xmath54 kpc , @xmath55 , @xmath56 km s@xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 kpc , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for this choice",
    "the model circular velocity reproduces the observed rotation curve of ngc 891 ( see fig .",
    "[ rotcur.891 ] , solid line ) , and @xmath66 everywhere . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq.state])-([velocity ] ) , the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath67 do not depend on the value of  @xmath48 .",
    "the meridional section of the isorotation surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "[ veltemp ] as solid lines : @xmath27 decreases with @xmath4 over the main body of the distribution , with the exception of the region @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath27 varies in a non - monothonic way with @xmath4 .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .  [ rotcur.891 ] corresponds to a horizontal cut of fig .",
    "[ veltemp ] , at @xmath70 kpc , superimposed to the observed values of the h@xmath0i@xmath1 rotation velocity at the same @xmath4 .",
    "the match between the observed points and the model curve is surprisingly good , in particular when considering that the exploratory nature of the presented model .",
    "the model isothermal surfaces are also shown in fig .",
    "[ veltemp ] as dashed lines . as expected , the gas distribution is quite hot , with temperatures in the range @xmath71 k. the hotter region is `` bubble '' near the symmetry axis above ( and below ) the equatorial plane , while the gas temperature decreases steadily approaching the galactic disk . in @xcite",
    "we present and discuss ( soft ) x - ray total luminosity and surface brightness maps of our models . in order to compare the model with the observations the value for the central gas density , @xmath48 , must be known .",
    "in fact , one could proceed as follows : while the dimensionless part of eq .",
    "( [ rho.gas ] ) can be fixed to reproduce the rotational and temperature fields , the observed total x - ray luminosity could be used to determine @xmath48 . with",
    "this parameter fixed , one can then discuss other , astrophysically relevant model properties ( see next section ) .",
    "we have presented fluid models for the extra - planar gas in spiral galaxies .",
    "the approach is based on the class of hydrodynamical equilibria known as baroclinic solutions . in particular , we have showed how very simple baroclinic configurations can be caracterized by a decrease of rotational velocity with increasing @xmath4 similar to that observed in the extra - planar gas of spiral galaxies .",
    "we remark that baroclinic solutions are very flexible : for instance , if we require @xmath27 to reach the systemic velocity for large @xmath72 ( i.e. , the halo becomes hydrostatic ) , one could repeat the previous analysis with a factorized gas density distribution as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 at large @xmath72 and @xmath75 is an hydrostatic equilibrium solution in the galactic potential .",
    "even more general cases can be obtained by `` perturbing '' cylindrical rotation solution , i.e. , by assuming @xmath76 . for such distributions",
    "several interesting results similar to those reported in points @xmath46 and @xmath35 can be easily derived @xcite .",

    "observationally the gas is multiphase : what is the relationship between the ( hot ) single - phase gas described by fluid models and the h@xmath0i@xmath1 and h@xmath2 components of extra - planar gas ?",
    "\\2 ) absence of vertical motions .",
    "observations show vertical motions of the order of @xmath77 km / s , while in the approach described in sect .",
    "3 such motions are excluded : is this enough reason to abandon stationary fluid solutions ?",
    "about point 1 ) , a first important insight will be given by the calculation , for a chosen baroclinic distribution , of the _ local _ and _ global _ cooling times .",
    "in fact , while the global cooling time sets the rate at which heat must be furnished to the distribution in order to assure stationarity , the local cooling time indicates where clouds will condense out of the smooth density distribution",
    ". it would be interesting to follow the trajectories of such falling clouds under the drag force of the gas and with initial conditions given by the baroclinic solution .",
    "thermal conduction could be another important ingredient in the evolution of the clouds . of similar interest",
    "would be the study of the interaction of cosmologically accreted cold gas with a hot rotating halo .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to measure evaporation times and to find out whether and on what time - scales the kinematical regularity of the fluid solution is transferred to the infalling cloud population .",
    "as to point 2 ) , in addition to the comments above , we also note that baroclinic solutions can be generalized to include meridional motions .",
    "this generalization is not trivial but can be obtained , at least in the geostrophic limit ( i.e. , for small rossby numbers ) , by standard expansion techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical methods are required to investigate existence and properties of solutions with faster meridional motions . in any case",
    ", it can not be excluded that also meridional motions may play a role in the kinematics of the hot gas .",
    "thus , it is clear that the ballistic and fluid approaches both give important ( but restricted ) informations about the state of the extra - planar gas .",
    "a better understanding of the problem will be obtained by the investigation of the interaction of clouds with baroclinic fluid configurations using time - dependent numerical hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "numerical simulations will also clarify the fate of the `` torus - like '' structure common in baroclinic distributions .",
