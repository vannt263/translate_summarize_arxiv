    "cluster algorithms are among the most efficient tools for numerical simulations of nonperturbative lattice field theories and statistical mechanics models . the first cluster algorithm for discrete classical spins",
    "was developed by swendsen and wang for ising and potts models @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was generalized by wolff to @xmath3 models formulated in terms of continuous classical spins @xcite . in the 2-d @xmath4 model",
    "the wolff cluster algorithm has been extended to a meron - cluster algorithm which has been used to solve the complex action problem at non - zero @xmath5-vacuum angle @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 models in two dimensions @xcite provide a generalization of the @xmath6 model alternative to @xmath3 models .",
    "they have a global @xmath1 symmetry and share several features with qcd , including asymptotic freedom , the nonperturbative dynamical generation of a mass - gap , a topological charge , and thus nontrivial @xmath5-vacua . finding efficient algorithms for @xmath0 models is difficult in the standard wilson formulation .",
    "in particular , a wolff - type embedding cluster algorithm turned out to be inefficient for @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is even a no - go theorem that prevents the success of this type of algorithms @xcite .",
    "still , a rather efficient multigrid algorithm does exist @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "however , due to a very severe complex action problem , no efficient algorithm has ever been found for non - zero vacuum angle .",
    "consequently , in the wilson formulation numerical studies of @xmath5-vacua @xcite have been limited to moderate volumes , or are based on additional assumptions @xcite .    _ d - theory _ is an alternative formulation of field theory in which continuous classical fields arise dynamically as collective excitations by the _ dimensional _ reduction of _ discrete _ variables such as quantum spins @xcite .",
    "the discrete nature of the quantum variables allows the development of new types of cluster algorithms .",
    "the first cluster algorithm for quantum spins was developed in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm works efficiently for 1-d ferro- and antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains , while the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite works efficiently in any dimension . for example , the loop - algorithm has led to very accurate simulations of the 2-d heisenberg quantum antiferromagnet @xcite , which can even be performed in continuous euclidean time @xcite .",
    "the d - theory formulation of field theory has been used , for example , to construct an efficient cluster algorithm that solves the complex action problem in the 2-d @xmath4 model at non - zero chemical potential @xcite . in this paper",
    "we construct an efficient algorithm for the d - theory formulation of @xmath0 models .",
    "the d - theory approach allows efficient simulations both at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in d - theory @xmath0 models",
    "are represented by ferro- or antiferromagnetic @xmath1 quantum spin systems . just like the @xmath9 heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath1 quantum antiferromagnets",
    "can be simulated with the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite which was recently reviewed in @xcite . here",
    "we construct an @xmath1 loop - cluster algorithm for a ferromagnet to study @xmath0 models at @xmath7 , and we investigate their numerical efficiency .",
    "we find a dynamical exponent for critical slowing down which is consistent with @xmath2 .",
    "the d - theory method even solves the @xmath5-vacuum sign problem , and has recently allowed us to confirm the conjectured first order phase transition @xcite at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the standard wilson formulation of lattice @xmath0 models in section 2 and the d - theory formulation in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes the path integral formulation for @xmath0 models in terms of ferromagnetic quantum spins transforming in the fundamental representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding loop - cluster algorithm is constructed in section 5 , and its efficiency is investigated in section 6 . finally , section 7 contains our conclusions .",
    "the manifold @xmath11 is a @xmath12-dimensional coset space relevant in the context of the spontaneous breakdown of an @xmath1 symmetry to a @xmath13 subgroup . in particular , in more than two space - time dimensions ( @xmath14 ) the corresponding goldstone bosons are described by an @xmath15 matrix - valued field @xmath16 which obeys @xmath17 for @xmath18 the hohenberg - mermin - wagner - coleman theorem implies that the @xmath1 symmetry can not break spontaneously . correspondingly , similar to 4-d non - abelian gauge theories , the field @xmath19 develops a mass - gap nonperturbatively .",
    "motivated by these observations , dadda , di vecchia , and lscher  @xcite introduced @xmath0 models as interesting toy models for qcd .",
    "the corresponding euclidean action is given by @xmath20 = \\int d^2x \\ \\frac{1}{g^2 } \\mbox{tr}[\\partial_\\mu p \\partial_\\mu p ] - i \\theta q[p],\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the topological charge @xmath22 = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i } \\int d^2x \\ \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu } \\mbox{tr } [ p \\partial_\\mu p \\partial_\\nu p ] \\in \\pi_2[cp(n-1 ) ] = { { \\sf z \\!\\!\\ !",
    "z}},\\ ] ] takes integer values in the second homotopy group of @xmath0 in eq.([cpncharge ] ) is necessary for obtaining a real - valued quantity .",
    "] , and @xmath5 is the corresponding vacuum angle . note that both the action and the topological charge are invariant under global transformations @xmath23 @xmath24    the topological term explicitly breaks the charge conjugation symmetry @xmath25 which acts as @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 = - q[p]$ ] .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath25 is not explicitly broken at @xmath7 or @xmath8 . in particular , for @xmath10 the boltzmann weight @xmath28 ) = ( -1)^{q[p]}$ ] is @xmath25-invariant .",
    "for @xmath29 it has been conjectured that there is a first order phase transition at @xmath10 , at which charge conjugation is broken spontaneously  @xcite . recently ,",
    "this has been confirmed numerically using a cluster algorithm similar to the one described below  @xcite . for @xmath30 ,",
    "on the other hand , charge conjugation remains unbroken , but there is still a second order phase transition at @xmath10  @xcite . at that point",
    "the model corresponds to the @xmath31 wess - zumino - novikov - witten conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to define @xmath0 models beyond perturbation theory in the framework of wilson s lattice regularization .",
    "then the field @xmath32 is defined on the sites @xmath33 of a quadratic lattice and the standard lattice action is given by @xmath34 = - \\frac{2}{g^2 } \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\mbox{tr}[p_x p_{x+\\hat \\mu}],\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the unit - vector in the @xmath36-direction .",
    "in this section we describe an alternative formulation of field theory in which the @xmath37-dimensional @xmath0 model emerges from the dimensional reduction of discrete variables  in this case @xmath1 quantum spins in @xmath38 space - time dimensions .",
    "the dimensional reduction of discrete variables is the key ingredient of d - theory , which provides an alternative nonperturbative lattice regularization of field theory . in d - theory",
    "we start from a ferromagnetic system of @xmath1 quantum spins located at the sites @xmath33 of a @xmath37-dimensional periodic hypercubic lattice of size @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath1 spins are represented by hermitean operators @xmath40 that generate the group @xmath1 ( e.g.  the gell - mann matrices for the triplet representation of @xmath41 ) and thus they obey @xmath42 = i \\delta_{xy } f_{abc } t_x^c ,",
    "\\quad \\mbox{tr}(t_x^a t_y^b ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\delta_{xy } \\delta_{ab}.\\ ] ] in principle , these generators can be taken in any irreducible representation of @xmath1 . however , not all representations lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath13 and thus to @xmath0 models .",
    "the hamilton operator for an @xmath1 ferromagnet takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the exchange coupling . by construction ,",
    "the hamilton operator is invariant under the global @xmath1 symmetry , i.e.  it commutes with the total spin given by @xmath45 the hamiltonian @xmath46 describes the evolution of the quantum spin system in an extra dimension of finite extent @xmath47 . in d",
    "- theory this extra dimension is not the euclidean time of the target theory , which is part of the @xmath37-dimensional lattice .",
    "instead , it is an additional compactified dimension which ultimately disappears via dimensional reduction .",
    "the quantum partition function @xmath48 ( with the trace extending over the hilbert space ) gives rise to periodic boundary conditions in the extra dimension .",
    "for @xmath49 the ground state of the quantum spin system has a broken global @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the choice of the @xmath1 representation determines the symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "we choose a totally symmetric @xmath1 representation corresponding to a young tableau with a single row containing @xmath50 boxes .",
    "it is easy to construct the ground states of the @xmath1 ferromagnet , and one finds spontaneous symmetry breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , there are @xmath51 massless goldstone bosons described by a field @xmath19 in the coset space @xmath52 . in the leading order of chiral perturbation theory",
    "the euclidean action for the goldstone boson field is given by @xmath53 = \\int_0^\\beta dt \\int d^dx \\",
    "\\mbox{tr } [ \\rho_s \\partial_\\mu p \\partial_\\mu p - \\frac{2 n}{a^2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau \\",
    "p \\partial_t p \\partial_\\tau p].\\ ] ] here @xmath54 is the spin stiffness which is analogous to the pion decay constant in qcd . the second term in eq.([ferroaction ] ) is a wess - zumino term which involves an integral over an interpolation parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the point @xmath56 corresponds to the physical space - time , such that @xmath57 . at @xmath58 ,",
    "on the other hand , the field takes the constant value @xmath59 . at intermediate values of @xmath55 the field is smoothly interpolated between the two limiting cases .",
    "there is no topological obstruction against such an interpolation because @xmath60 $ ] is trivial .",
    "the integrand in the wess - zumino term is a total derivative .",
    "hence , the integral depends only on the boundary values at @xmath56 , i.e.  on the values of the field in the physical space - time .",
    "however , since @xmath61 = { { \\sf z \\!\\!\\ !",
    "z}}$ ] , there is an integer ambiguity of the integral depending on which particular interpolation is chosen for @xmath62 . in order to make sure that this ambiguity does not affect the physics",
    ", the prefactor of the wess - zumino term must be quantized .",
    "remarkably , this prefactor is just determined by the number of boxes @xmath50 of the chosen @xmath1 representation .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath18 case . for @xmath63",
    "the system then has a spontaneously broken global symmetry and thus massless goldstone bosons .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath47 becomes finite , due to the hohenberg - mermin - wagner - coleman theorem , the symmetry can no longer be broken , and , consequently , the goldstone bosons pick up a small mass @xmath64 nonperturbatively . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding correlation length @xmath65 becomes finite and the @xmath1 symmetry is restored over that length scale .",
    "the question arises if @xmath66 is bigger or smaller than the extent @xmath47 of the extra dimension .",
    "when @xmath67 the goldstone boson field is essentially constant along the extra dimension and the system undergoes dimensional reduction .",
    "since the wess - zumino term contains @xmath68 , it simply vanishes after dimensional reduction .",
    "correspondingly , the action dimensionally reduces to @xmath69 = \\beta \\rho_s \\int d^2x \\ \\mbox{tr}[\\partial_\\mu p \\partial_\\mu p],\\ ] ] which is just the action of the 2-d target @xmath0 model at @xmath70 .",
    "the coupling constant of the 2-d model is determined by the extent of the extra dimension and is given by @xmath71 due to asymptotic freedom of the 2-d @xmath0 model , for small @xmath21 the correlation length is exponentially large , i.e.@xmath72 here @xmath73 is the 1-loop coefficient of the perturbative @xmath47-function .",
    "indeed , one sees that @xmath67 as long as @xmath47 itself is sufficiently large .",
    "in particular , somewhat counter - intuitively , dimensional reduction happens in the large @xmath47 limit because @xmath66 then grows exponentially . in d - theory one",
    "approaches the continuum limit not by varying a bare coupling constant but by increasing the extent @xmath47 of the extra dimension .",
    "this mechanism of dimensional reduction of discrete variables is generic and occurs in all asymptotically free d - theory models @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that ( just like in the standard approach ) no fine - tuning is needed to approach the continuum limit .    in order to show that d - theory indeed defines the same field theory in the continuum limit as the standard wilson approach ,",
    "we have evaluated a universal physical quantity in both regularizations @xcite .",
    "a convenient quantity is the universal finite - size scaling function @xmath74 .",
    "here @xmath75 is the correlation length ( obtained with the second moment method ) in a finite system of size @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is a finite size scaling variable that measures the size of the system in physical units .",
    "figure 1 shows monte carlo data for @xmath78 obtained both from d - theory and from the standard wilson approach . up to small scaling violations , the agreement of the two data sets confirms that , after dimensional reduction , the @xmath79-d @xmath1 quantum ferromagnet indeed provides the correct continuum limit of the 2-d @xmath0 model .",
    "thanks to the cluster algorithm , the d - theory framework allows calculations that are much more accurate than the ones using wilson s approach .",
    "let us also discuss the @xmath14 case .",
    "then dimensional reduction still occurs , but the goldstone bosons remain massless even at finite @xmath47 .",
    "however , if @xmath47 is decreased sufficiently , the @xmath1 symmetry is restored and the goldstone modes are replaced by massive excitations . by fine - tuning @xmath47 to the critical value ( again , as in the standard approach ) one can reach a continuum limit of the target theory , provided that the corresponding phase transition is second order .",
    "let us construct a path integral representation for the partition function @xmath80 of the @xmath1 quantum spin ferromagnet introduced above .",
    "in an intermediate step we introduce a lattice in the euclidean time direction , using a trotter decomposition of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , since we are dealing with discrete variables , the path integral is completely well - defined even in continuous euclidean time .",
    "also the cluster algorithm to be described in the following section can operate directly in the euclidean time continuum @xcite . hence , the final results are completely independent of the trotter decomposition . in @xmath37 spatial dimensions ( with an even extent @xmath76 )",
    "we decompose the hamilton operator into @xmath81 terms @xmath82 with @xmath83 the individual contributions @xmath84 to a given @xmath85 commute with each other , but two different @xmath85 do not commute . using the trotter formula , the partition function then takes the form @xmath86 we have introduced @xmath87 euclidean time - slices with @xmath88 being the lattice spacing in the euclidean time direction .    inserting complete sets of spin states",

    "let us now discuss the cluster algorithm for the @xmath1 quantum ferromagnet .",
    "just like the original @xmath9 loop - cluster algorithm @xcite , the @xmath1 cluster algorithm builds a closed loop connecting neighboring lattice points with the spin in the same quantum state , and then changes the state of all spins in that cluster to a different randomly chosen common value . to begin cluster growth ,",
    "an initial lattice point @xmath94 is picked at random .",
    "the spin located at that point participates in two plaquette interactions , one before and one after @xmath101 .",
    "one picks one interaction arbitrarily and considers the states of the other spins on that plaquette .",
    "one of the corners of this interaction plaquette will be the next point on the loop . for configurations",
    "@xmath102 $ ] or @xmath103 $ ] the next point is the time - like neighbor of @xmath94 on the plaquette , while for configurations @xmath104 $ ] or @xmath105 $ ] the next point is the diagonal neighbor . if the states are all the same , i.e.  for @xmath106 $ ] or @xmath107 $ ] , with probability @xmath108\\ ] ] the next point on the loop is again the time - like neighbor , and with probability @xmath109 it is the diagonal neighbor .",
    "the next point on the loop belongs to another interaction plaquette on which the same process is repeated . in this way the loop grows until it finally closes .",
    "the cluster rules are consistent with detailed balance , i.e.@xmath110 where @xmath111)$ ] is the boltzmann weight of the plaquette configuration and @xmath112 is the transition probability to go from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .    with this single - cluster algorithm , the uniform susceptibility of eq.([sus ] ) has an improved estimator @xmath115 given in terms of the cluster size @xmath116 this shows explicitly that the clusters are physical objects whose size is directly related to a physical quantity .",
    "in order to quantify the efficiency of our numerical method , we have used a multi - cluster algorithm for a @xmath79-dimensional @xmath41 ferromagnet in discrete euclidean time to investigate the autocorrelation times of the uniform magnetization which gives the cleanest signal .",
    "a monte carlo history of this observable is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this already indicates that autocorrelations are very much suppressed .",
    ".__numerical data for the correlation length @xmath75 and the autocorrelation time @xmath55 for an @xmath41-symmetric ferromagnet corresponding to a @xmath117 model in d - theory .",

    "our data are summarized in table 1 . since the autocorrelation time @xmath55 does not show any dependence on @xmath75 , critical slowing down is practically eliminated . in particular ,",
    "our data are consistent with @xmath2 .",
    "we have constructed an efficient cluster algorithm for @xmath0 models within the theoretical framework of d - theory .",
    "the continuous classical @xmath0 field then emerges dynamically from the dimensional reduction of discrete @xmath1 quantum spins .",
    "our cluster algorithm is a generalization of the loop algorithm for @xmath9 quantum spins .",
    "we have investigated the algorithm s efficiency by estimating its autocorrelation times .",
    "our monte carlo data show that critical slowing down is practically absent , i.e.  the dynamical critical exponent is consistent with @xmath2 .",
    "this is thus another example where the d - theory formulation allows us to construct efficient numerical methods which are not available using the standard wilson lattice field theory .",
    "in particular , the use of the discrete d - theory variables evades the no - go theorem that prevents the construction of efficient wolff - type embedding algorithms for @xmath0 models in the standard wilson formulation .",
    "interestingly , using spin ladders with both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings , @xmath0 models can even be simulated at vacuum angle @xmath10 @xcite with no additional numerical effort . in particular , the sign problem that afflicts the standard approach is completely eliminated . using the cluster algorithm described in this paper one can perform accurate numerical simulations of the @xmath0 mass gap for which no analytic results are available .",
    "also the approach to the large @xmath120 limit can now be investigated in detail .",
    "it is also interesting to ask if d - theory allows us to construct efficient cluster algorithms for other field theories such as , e.g. , @xmath121 chiral models with @xmath29 to which the no - go theorem also applies .",
    "of course , the most challenging application of d - theory would be to non - abelian gauge theories and , in particular , to qcd @xcite .",
