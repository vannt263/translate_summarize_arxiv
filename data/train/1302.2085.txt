    "same arguments are also applicable to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) . hence , focusing can approximate the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - mat6 ] ) and ( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) fairly well when @xmath150 is small or the system - bath coupling is weak ; _ i.e. _ , a separation of time scale can be assumed .",
    "unfortunately , these assumptions are not valid in the long - time limit for most physical systems .    by using focusing",
    ", one avoids the full sampling from the gaussians in the mc evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - mat6 ] ) and ( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) . as indicated in many numerical tests@xcite , focusing often yields a converged result with at least an order of magnitude fewer trajectories than that required for a full calculations . however , when used indiscriminately , focusing might yield poor results  @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the quantum subsystem is initially in a single subsystem state @xmath151 .",
    "this requirement is not as restrictive as it might appear , since our formalism does not dictate which particular quantum subsystem basis is to be used .",
    "therefore , we can often take the initial state of the system to be a vector in the basis .",
    "when focusing  @xcite is applied to the fbts , the approximation restricts the initial conditions of the trajectories to a very narrow region in the phase space specified by the dirac delta functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : focusing ] ) .",
    "first , we discuss the effects of the focused initial conditions on the forward and backward coherent state trajectories . in appendix b , we prove that the backward coherent state trajectories can be replaced by the forward trajectories in the fbts if focused initial conditions are imposed and the required assumptions ( such as the separation of time scales ) are valid .",
    "this observation shows that the two sets of trajectories are highly synchronized in the sense explained in appendix b. one manifestation of such synchronization is the reduction of noise in the calculation of the phase factor of the quantum subsystem density matrix element , @xmath152 . in the full fbst calculation ,",
    "such a matrix element is determined by the ensemble average of @xmath153 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - mat6 ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of focused initial conditions , one can simply replace @xmath154 with @xmath155 in the above expression for the ensemble average .",
    "for instance , if one employs the formalism to compute a diagonal density matrix element , @xmath156 , then one finds that this replacement yields an exact real number as required .",
    "for the full calculation , one needs to average over a large number of trajectories to suppress the noisy imaginary components .",
    "next we consider the effects of focused initial conditions on bath trajectories .",
    "as mentioned earlier , focusing should be a valid approximation for an initial short time interval or for a weak subsystem - bath coupling .",

    "should be averaged over all possible values of @xmath164 with respect to the gaussian distribution @xmath165 .    for situations typical of a scattering problem , where the quantum subsystem is initialized in the asymptotic region with @xmath166 ( the subsystem basis and the adiabatic basis coincide ) , the final form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : focus_bathp ] ) reduces to @xmath167 .",
    "this simple bath dynamics is the adiabatic approximation in the asymptotic region .",
    "in contrast , the full calculation requires summation over a large number of trajectories such that the interferences among them leads to the adiabatic approximation .",
    "however , in the interaction region of the scattering potential , this adiabatic approximation is certainly not sufficient .",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ eq : focus_bathp ] ) shows that focusing includes more than the adiabatic approximation on the bath dynamics , it simply does not include enough corrections to fully describe the dynamics in the interaction region in many cases .",
    "for instance , in a recent calculations on a simple avoided crossing model  @xcite , huo and coker showed  @xcite that the correct bath properties can not be reliably extracted from focused initial conditions .      while focusing is not an essential part of the fbts , it is often the only tractable means by which one can obtain a converged jfbts solution when one needs more than five jumps in order to obtain the qcle result .",
    "similar to several iterative schemes of partially linearized path integral formalisms@xcite , such as ipldm , we rely on focusing s superior convergence properties to minimize the increasing number of trajectories required to produce a stable result .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - mat6 ] ) and ( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) , the jfbts essentially adds a sequence of summations over intermediate quantum states , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , and integrals over coherent state variables @xmath77 and @xmath170 on top of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - mat6 ] ) . while an exact evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) is conceptually straightforward , the numerical implementation incorporating the focusing approximation is slightly more complicated .",
    "first we evaluate the sequence of intermediate summations by an importance sampling mc calculation .",
    "this technique has been adopted in several related qcle and linearized path integral algorithms@xcite .",
    "thus , in each mc run , we randomly select a pair of forward and backward quantum states @xmath171 at every @xmath172-th jump instead of summing over all quantum states .",
    "the pair selection is governed by a discrete probability distribution , @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "this probability distribution is based on the intuition that the selection of the pair indices should be related to the present distribution of the population weight , @xmath175 , over all quantum states .",
    "a re - weighting factor , @xmath176 , is added to the mc evaluation whenever such an importance sampling is made .",
    "once the selection of a pair of quantum indices is made for the @xmath172-th jump , we use the focusing approximation with the condition @xmath177 to evaluate the integral over @xmath77 and @xmath170 . in the above focusing condition , we imply that all unspecified components of forward and backward variables are set to zero .    now we analyze the effects of iterative focusing on the trajectories in the jfbts formalism .",
    "first , we provide an intuitive picture of the trajectory evolution when full sampling over coherent state variables and full summation over quantum states at each intermediate step are performed exactly . at the initial time ,",
    "@xmath147 , we assign initial conditions of @xmath178 and @xmath179 for each quantum state @xmath180 by sampling from the gaussian @xmath181 .",
    "the trajectories are then propagated with hamiltonian dynamics based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : vol - nonh ] ) . at each time step , we stochastically decide if a jump should be introduced . when a jump is introduced at time @xmath150 , we store a snapshot of the trajectories by saving the polynomial factor @xmath182 for each @xmath183 , where the plus and minus signs are for forward and backward coherent state variables , respectively .",
    "then we discard the trajectories and re - sample new initial conditions for those trajectories .",
    "we also take a snapshot of the new trajectories by saving the polynomial factor @xmath184 prior to further propagation .",
    "the same process is then be repeated until the simulated time length has been reached . due to the interferences in the full summations of the products of the polynomial factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) , only those trajectories with rather minimal discontinuities contribute significantly to the final result .",
    "next we describe a rather different evolution of trajectories in the phase space .",
    "the combination of the importance sampling of intermediate quantum state indices and the focusing approximation for the coherent state integrals yields a picture involving trajectory collapse whenever a jump is introduced . in this numerical implementation , each forward and backward trajectory can only be initialized in the given pair of quantum states , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "once the initial conditions are assigned to the trajectories , the population weights , @xmath187 , of the trajectories will gradually shift from the initial states , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , to other states in the forward and backward phase space , respectively . after some time",
    ", the population weights may become more uniformly distributed over all available states .",
    "there will then come a moment where a jump is introduced , a new pair of quantum indices is selected , and a new focusing condition is imposed to collapse all trajectories onto the new pair of forward and backward states .",
    "these two rather different pictures of the trajectory evolution make one wonder if iterative focusing applied to the jfbts can be trusted .",
    "we argue that the result should be reliable .",
    "different from the focused initial condition where the states to be focused onto are fixed , iterative focusing collapses the forward and backward trajectories into all possible combinations of pairs of quantum states .",
    "therefore , if we have a large enough mc sample , we will eventually obtain collapsed trajectories re - initialized in all possible quantum states and recover an ensemble picture that is in accord with that of the full - sampling case .",
    "we now present the results obtained from simulations of the fbts and jfbts for four models , which are selected to examine different aspects of the simulation algorithms .",
    "in particular , we use these results to illustrate the following : first , the differential form of the fbts has been shown  @xcite to be invariant to the following forms of hamiltonian , @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 where @xmath191 denotes the trace over subsystem dof .",
    "the local , infinitesimal time - step analysis can be extended to a finite - interval time scale if the orthogonality approximation is not used and , in this case , results using either form of the hamiltonian will be identical . however",
    ", if the orthogonality approximation is made , global errors which depend the form of the hamiltonian will accumulate .",
    "the traceless version of the hamiltonian often yields similar or better results than the trace form , since it is less susceptible to problems due to inverted potentials .",
    "analysis of the results of the dual avoided crossing ( tully 2 ) and the fenna - mathews - olsen ( fmo ) models support this conclusion . for consistency , we will display the hamiltonian in trace - form when we introduce the models in this section , although calculations have been carried using both forms as indicated below .",
    "second , we analyze the effects of focused initial conditions on the fbts .",
    "we use results of the tully 2 model and spin - boson models to illustrate the trajectory picture described in sec .",
    "[ sec : focusing ] . through these examples , we show that the tully 2 and symmetric spin - boson models represent a small set of special cases where the use of focused initial conditions might yield results similar to those of the full sampling calculation .",
    "last , we consider the application of iterative focusing with jfbts to alleviate the onerous demands on the very large number of trajectories required in the full - sampling calculations . from the results on the asymmetric spin - boson and conical intersection models , we demonstrate the convergence of the jfbts to the qcle solution . due to the fact that trajectories collapse onto a pair of diabatic surfaces at each jump",
    ", it turns out that the selection of the subsystem basis ( _ i.e. _ , which diabatic surfaces are used ) in the formalism affects the convergence of the results .",

    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : if ] , the importance sampling used to select a pair of forward and backward state indices , @xmath171 , for the collapse of the trajectories in each mc run helps to avoid doing the exact summation over state indices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqc_soln - jump2 ] ) .",
    "thus , another key to the efficiency of the jfbts algorithm is to have a dispersed probability distribution for @xmath257 in order to select as many different combinations of states as possible .",

    "however , we prefer the distribution @xmath173 defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : if ] since it minimizes the abrupt changes that can influence the bath dynamics .",
    "another way to obtain a more uniform distribution is to select a basis where the off - diagonal matrix elements are maximized since these influence population transfer among different levels .    in the original basis , the flv model has a sharply peaked off - diagonal matrix element , @xmath259 .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic region where @xmath260 , the population distribution over the quantum states does not change significantly even if jumps are introduced in the jfbts calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : flv_mtx]a shows the population distribution over pairs of forward and backward quantum states for a typical trajectory in the original basis .",
    "the distribution is highly localized on one particular pair of states , except when the system moves through the interaction region where @xmath259 approaches maximum strength ; however , @xmath259 has a rather steep profile and the interaction region occupies a very small portion of the phase space .",
    "therefore , extensive mc sampling involving many jumps would be required to sample all different pairs of states . by contrast , in the rotated basis @xmath261 are now the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix , and the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath262 is linearly dependent on @xmath17 . in the `` asymptotic '' region ( where @xmath260 ) , the two diagonal matrix elements are approximately energetically degenerate in the rotated basis .",
    "consequently , population transfer occurs easily in the `` asymptotic '' region . since the `` asymptotic '' region represents the bulk of the phase space , fig .",
    "[ fig : flv_mtx]b shows a more balanced and oscillating population distribution over pairs of forward and backward quantum states for a typical trajectory in the rotated basis .",
    "these results show that the fbts formalism can be customized and several modifications , such as the choice of subsystem basis and the jump probability distribution , etc .",
    ", can be independently tuned and adapted to suit the problem under study without actually changing the structure of the algorithm . from the analysis of flv model , we have seen how to determine the most suitable subsystem basis for the jfbts calculation .",
    "in this work , we demonstrated the usefulness of the fbts through simulations of a variety of systems . in most instances , we obtained converged results with @xmath263 trajectories .",
    "these numerical tests suggest that the fbts performs at the same level of accuracy and efficiency as the pldm@xcite , a closely related algorithm .",
    "we showed that the traceless - form hamiltonian yields more accurate results when there is no dominant pure bath potential in the model and should be used for all numerical computations . in cases where the fbts results were compromised by the orthogonally approximation , we demonstrated that these results could be systematically improved by increasing the number of jumps in the generalized jfbts algorithm . in order to make jfbts a computationally efficient algorithm",
    ", we carried out a detailed investigation of the focusing approximation and provided an extensive analysis of the approximate trajectory dynamics .",
    "this analysis indicated that focused initial conditions should be used only when the nonadiabatic effects can be treated as a weak perturbation or for special cases such as the symmetric spin - boson model where the bath is rather insensitive to the differences between the quantum states . finally , we also justified the validity of iterative focusing in the jfbts . in all cases studied the qcle solution either reproduced the exact quantum results or was a very good approximation to the exact results .",
    "thus , the ability of the fbts and jfbts to reproduce the qcle solution also implies an ability to reproduce the full quantum results .",
    "the number of jumps used in the jfbts determines how many trajectories will be needed to obtain a converged result . as noted throughout the paper , several implementation details of the jfbts algorithm",
    "can be customized to significantly reduce the minimum number of jumps and improve the convergence properties of the algorithm .",
    "in addition , the number of jumps needed to obtain qcle result will certainly depend on the details of the hamiltonian of each model .",
    "it is not a simple manner to predict the number of jumps and trajectories required to obtain the full qcle result for an arbitrary system .",
    "however , at least two orders of magnitude increase in the number of trajectories ( in comparison to the corresponding fbts calculation ) should be expected for most cases in which the fbts results are compromised by the orthogonality approximation .",
    "perhaps the greatest utility of the jfbts algorithm is that it provides a simple method to gauge the sufficiency of the fbts when one studies nonadiabatic dynamics for complex real systems , beyond the simple benchmark models studied here for which exact quantum results are known .",
    "potential improvements to the family of ( j)fbts algorithms are still possible ; especially , it might be helpful to reformulate the entire formalism in the adiabatic basis . currently , the flexibility of the algorithm can be traced back to the use of the subsystem basis , which is not uniquely defined as in the case of adiabatic basis . in particular , a current challenge of the jfbts algorithm is related to the determination of the best timings for the insertion of jumps in the course of trajectory evolution . in the current formulation , there are no indicators which help to make this judgement . however , as is often the case with surface hopping algorithms formulated in the adiabatic basis , we expect that inherent indicators naturally emerge from the formalism once it is re - expressed in the adiabatic basis .",
