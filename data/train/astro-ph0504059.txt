    "a long gamma - ray burst ( grb ) was detected on 2003 march 28 at 11:20:58.34 ut by the hete-2 spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray event showed a duration of approximately 100 seconds in the 30 - 400 kev energy band , so it belongs to the category of `` long - duration '' grbs @xcite .",
    "the grb peak flux over 5.2 seconds was @xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , and the fluence was @xmath7 erg @xmath5 in the mentioned energy band .",
    "optical images taken @xmath8 hours after the grb revealed the associated optical afterglow ( oa ) @xcite .",
    "subsequent low resolution spectroscopy determined a redshift value of @xmath9 for the oa @xcite .",
    "nevertheless no host galaxy detection has been reported to date .    throughout , we assume a cosmology where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the luminosity distance of grb  030328 is @xmath13 gpc and the look - back time is 9.05  gyr ( @xmath14 % of the present universe age ) .",
    "in the present paper we report optical multicolour imaging of the grb 030328 host galaxy .",
    "the observations were carried out with the calar alto ( caha ) 2.2-m telescope @xmath151 year after the grb , when the contribution of the oa was negligible .",
    "the data were collected with the busca camera @xcite , which allows simultaneous imaging in four optical bands .",
    "the four channels ( named @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are not standard filters , so they were calibrated by observing the spectro - photometric standard star gd153 @xcite at the same airmass to that of the grb field ( information on the four busca channels are described in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath16 is similar the johnson @xmath20-band , @xmath17 is a transition between johnson s @xmath2 and @xmath21 filters .",
    "@xmath18 is very close to the @xmath22-band and @xmath19 is identical to the @xmath23 filter .",
    "the covered field of view ( fov ) was @xmath24 , and the resulting pixel scale @xmath25/pix .",
    "the photometric and astrometric analysis of the field was complicated by the presence of two bright field stars ( @xmath26 ) located @xmath27 south from the oa position . in order to mitigate the high background they generated ,",
    "the busca camera was rotated 45 degrees and the telescope pointing was shifted that both stars were out of the fov . even with this configuration some degree of contamination was unavoidable , and a spike coming from the star crossed the oa position ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "reduction was based on standard procedures running under iraf and the photometry on phot . to account for the spike contamination",
    "three apertures were used ; two positioned along on the spike bracketing the oa equidistantly , and the third one on the oa .",
    "the fluxes of the two apertures were averaged and subtracted from the central one at the oa .",
    "this procedure only integrated the oa flux .",
    "the process was repeated moving the two apertures along the spike , giving the magnitude errors of table  [ table1 ] .",

    "the astrometric solution for each of the four co - added images was based on @xmath32 usno - a2.0 stars .",
    "the final host coordinates , obtained averaging the four channels , are ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the astrometric error for each coordinate is @xmath35 , not accounting for the systematic error of the usno - a2.0 catalogue ( @xmath36 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the main source of error comes from the uncertainty on the centroid position due to the bright spike contamination .",
    "the inferred position is consistent with the one reported for the oa @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the sed of the grb 030328 host galaxy once the observed flux densities have been corrected for galactic reddening ( @xmath37 , @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen a power law fit provides a satisfactory fit to the sed ( @xmath38 ) yielding a spectral index value of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .    in order to infer information on the host extinction the sed",
    "was fitted with the empirical galaxy templates described in @xcite ( k96 hereafter ) .",
    "the observed k96 templates can be grouped into seven sets : bulge ( b ) , e , s0 , sa , sb , sc and stb galaxies .",
    "additionally , the stb k96 templates are subdivided into six classes depending on their extinction by increasing @xmath41 in steps of 0.1 ( from stb1 to stb6 ; see more details in k96 ) .",
    "the extinction for the b , e , s0 , sa , sb , and sc templates is a free parameter .    the best fit is obtained with the blue stb1 and stb2 seds ( @xmath42 ) , which are defined to have the lowest extinctions among the k96 starburst templates ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the rest of redder templates yield worse results .",
    "thus , we conclude that the grb  030328 host is likely a blue low extinction starburst galaxy",
    ". this result agrees with the conclusion by @xcite , who found that grb hosts are similar to the blue starburst galaxies of the hubble deep field . for the stb1 and stb2",
    "sed fits the absolute @xmath2-band magnitude of the host is @xmath44 .",
    "no information can be obtained on the stellar population age since the 4000     jump is beyond our restframe wavelength range .",
