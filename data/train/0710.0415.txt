    "the photon plus jet ( `` @xmath4 ''  ) events have the sheer advantage that the isolated photons are mostly `` direct '' photons , which emerge unaltered from the hard - scattering and provide clean probe of the parton level dynamics @xcite .",
    "together with the jet kinematics , these events shed more light on the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "the parton level subprocesses include the compton - scattering @xmath5 which dominates in a wide kinematic range and the annihilation subprocess @xmath6 .",
    "studies of `` @xmath4 ''  events , therefore , offer precision tests of perturbative qcd as well as information on the gluon density inside the colliding hadrons .",
    "photons from hadron ( @xmath7 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) decays and the bremsstrahlung process provide the major background particularly at low transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) . however , their contribution is suppressed after application of tight photon isolation criteria .",
    "using about 1.1 fb@xmath3 of tevatron run ii data , d  has measured the triple differential cross section for @xmath0 process with a photon in the central pseudorapidity region , @xmath9 , and a leading jet with @xmath10 gev in either the central ( @xmath11 ) or the forward ( @xmath12 ) region .",
    "the photon @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) varies from 30 to 300 ( 200 ) gev for the central ( forward ) jets .",
    "the analysis considers four kinematic regions differing in @xmath14 and @xmath15 : ( 1 ) both central and same side , ( 2 ) both central and opposite side , ( 3 ) central photon , forward jet and same side , and ( 3 ) central photon , forward jet and opposite side .",
    "the kinematic region in the @xmath16 plane covered by the analysis ( approximately 0.007@xmath17 0.7 and 0.9@xmath1810@xmath19 gev@xmath20 ) significantly extends previous measurements .",
    "photons are identified in the d  detector as isolated energy deposits in the electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter consisting of 4 layers , em1-em4 .",
    "photon candidates are reconstructed with a cone algorithm with cone size @xmath21 .",
    "candidates are selected if there is significant energy in the em layers ( @xmath22% ) , and the probability to have a matched track is less than @xmath23% , and they satisfy an isolation requirement @xmath24/e_{em}(0.2)<0.07 $ ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total and em energies within cone size of 0.4 and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "we also limit the energy weighted cluster width in the finely - segmented em3 layer .",
    "potential backgrounds from @xmath27 boson decays to electrons and cosmics were suppressed by the cut on missing transverse energy @xmath28 .",
    "three discriminating variables were used for further background suppression : the number of em1 cells with energy @xmath29  gev within @xmath30 , the fraction of the em cluster energy deposited in the em1 layer , and the scalar sum of track @xmath31 in the ring of @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 gev ) around the photon cluster direction .",
    "these variables turned out to be very efficient for background suppression and show consistent behavior for mc / data electrons from @xmath34 events .",
    "they are used as an input to an artificial neural network ( nn ) optimized for pattern recognition .",
    "an additional cut on the nn output @xmath35 is applied .",
    "the total photon selection efficiency is about 62% at @xmath36 30 gev and increases to a plateau of @xmath3770% at @xmath3870 gev .",
    "the event is required to have at least one hadronic jet reconstucted with a cone algorithm of @xmath39 .",
    "the photon candidate and the most energetic jet were required to be well separated , @xmath40 .",
    "the total number of `` @xmath4 ''  events remaining in regions 14 after application of all the selection criteria is about 2.4 million ( @xmath4134.4% , 30.2% , 20.1% 13.3% in regions 1 to 4 ) .",
    "these events are used to calculate the cross sections in 15 @xmath13 bins varied from 30 to 300 gev for regions 1 , 2 and in 13 @xmath13 bins varied from 30 to 200 gev for regions 3 , 4 .",
    "the selected signal sample still contains a sizeable background dominated by the di - jet events when one jet fluctuates to a well isolated em cluster .",
    "these jets are primarily composed of one or more neutral mesons that decay into photons , and may also be accompanied by other soft hadrons whose energies are deposited in the em portion of the calorimeter . since the signal events can not be identified on an event - by - event basis , their fraction is determined statistically for a given @xmath13 bin . the photon purity ( @xmath42 )",
    "is determined by fitting the ann distribution in data to a linear combination of the predicted ann distributions for the signal and the background .",
    "the triple differential `` @xmath4 ''  cross section is obtained using the relation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of `` @xmath4 ''  candidates in the selected sample , @xmath45 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath46 is the signal selection efficiency , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the bin sizes in @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the factor @xmath53 corrects the cross section for the finite resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "the measured cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] as a function of @xmath13 with the full experimental ( systematic @xmath54 statistical ) errors .",
    "the largest uncertainties are caused by the purity estimation , photon and jet selections and luminosity .",
    "statistical errors vary from 0.1% in the first @xmath13 bin to @xmath55% in the last bin while systematic errors are within @xmath56% depending on region .",
    "the superimposed theoretical curve corresponds to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd predictions based on the jetphox program @xcite with the cteq6.1 m set of parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) and bfg set of fragmentation functions @xcite .",

    "only the statistical uncertainties are shown in the data points .",
    "the @xmath31 dependent systematic uncertainties are shown on the plots separately by a shaded region .",
    "the scale dependence of the predictions is estimated by varying the scales by factors of two which yield uncertainties of 911% for regions 13 and 1820% for region 4 .",
    "the choice of different parameterizations of pdf s lead to variations in the data / theory ratios up to about 10% for regions 13 and up to @xmath4120% for region 4 .",
    "the results of the measurements show a significant deviation from the nlo predictions for @xmath63 gev for the regions 1 and 2 and for @xmath64 gev for the region 3",
    ". such pattern of deviations in the data - to - theory ratios have earlier been encountered by the ua2 @xcite , cdf @xcite and d  @xcite analyses .",
    "these results do indicate the need of a better theoretical understanding of the processes with production of high energetic photons .",
    "in particular , calculations enhanced for soft - gluon contributions are expected to provide a better description of the data at low @xmath13 in region 3 .    in order to reduce the systematic uncertainties , we have also calculated ratios of the measured cross sections between different regions .",
    "most systematic uncertainties related to object ( @xmath65 & jet ) identification and luminosity are canceled in the ratios .",
    "the only systematic uncertainties that survive are related to the `` @xmath4 ''  event purities ( since they differ a little between the four regions ) and the jet selection efficiency when we calculate ratios with the central jet in one region and the forward jet in another region . the overall experimental uncertainty estimated in such a way is about 3.59% for @xmath66 gev and becomes larger for smaller @xmath13 ( due to systematics ) and larger @xmath13 ( due to statistics ) .",
    "also , the scale uncertainty in the ratios is noticeably reduced ; to the level of just 13% for regions 13 and up to 38% for region 4 . in general , the shapes of the measured cross section ratios in data are qualitatively reproduced by the theory but we observe a quantitative disagreement for some kinematic regions even after taking into account the overall ( experimental and theoretical scale ) uncertainty .",
    "it is especially noticeable for the cross section ratios between regions 1 & 3 as well as between regions 2 & 3 .",
