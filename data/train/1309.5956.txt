    "the detection of transits and eclipses in the broadband optical channel of _ kepler _ has enabled the geometric albedos of about a dozen hot jupiters to be measured . in figure",
    "[ fig : kepdata ] , we show the geometric albedo ( @xmath2 ) versus the incident stellar flux at the substellar point ( @xmath3 ) for a sample of hot jupiters , for which we have performed an improved analysis of q0q14 data ( see  [ subsect : data ] for details ) . to begin",
    "our discussion requires defining a few temperatures @xcite , @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the stellar effective temperature , @xmath6 the stellar radius and @xmath7 the orbital semi - major axis of the exoplanet .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 may be regarded as the  irradiation temperature \" at the substellar point , such that @xmath9 is the incident stellar flux ( or  stellar constant \" ) with @xmath10 denoting the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is our conventional definition of the  equilibrium temperature \" and includes a dimensionless factor @xmath12 that describes the efficiency of heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside hemisphere : we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 for no and full redistribution , respectively @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the equilibrium temperature assuming full redistribution and a vanishing albedo . strictly speaking",
    ", the geometric albedo is defined at a specific wavelength @xmath16 and at zero viewing angle .",
    "the spherical albedo ( @xmath17 ) is the geometric albedo considered over all viewing angles @xcite . for a lambertian sphere ( isotropic scattering )",
    ", we have @xmath18 .",
    "when integrated over all wavelengths , we obtain the bond albedo ( @xmath19 ) . since we are dealing with observations integrated over a broad optical bandpass , we assume @xmath20",
    "; the consideration of more sophisticated scattering behavior will introduce an order - of - unity correction factor to this relation .    for the range of @xmath15 values listed in table 1",
    ", we estimate that the hot jupiters examined in figure [ fig : kepdata ] radiate mostly at wavelengths of about 12 @xmath21 m",
    "( using wien s law ) . nevertheless , since the _ kepler _ bandpass extends from @xmath22 @xmath21 m to @xmath23 @xmath21 m @xcite , it is instructive to estimate the fraction of thermal flux from the exoplanet radiated in this bandpass , @xmath24 by approximating the spectral energy distribution of a hot jupiter to be a blackbody function . in figure",
    "[ fig : kepdata ] , we plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath3 for both @xmath26 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath25 may not be small and generally increases with @xmath3 , implying that the measured geometric albedo @xcite , @xmath27 may be contaminated by thermal emission  leaking \" into the _ kepler _ bandpass , causing @xmath2 to be over - estimated .",
    "the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the fluxes from the star and the exoplanet , respectively , received at earth , while the radius of the exoplanet is given by @xmath30 .",
    "one may approximately correct for the contamination by thermal emission by considering the following equation , @xmath31 \\left ( \\frac{a}{r_p } \\right)^2 \\\\ & = a_{g,{\\rm obs } } - \\frac{\\pi \\int^{\\lambda_2}_{\\lambda_1 } b_\\lambda\\left(t_{\\rm eq}\\right ) ~d \\lambda}{f_0 } \\left ( \\frac{a}{r_\\star } \\right)^2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the measured value of the geometric albedo obtained by applying equation ( [ eq : ag ] ) . since @xmath11 depends on @xmath2 ,",
    "the preceding expression is an implicit equation for the geometric albedo , which may be solved to obtain the  de - contaminated \" @xmath2 , also shown in figure [ fig : kepdata ] .",
    "the small and large open circles represent the corrected @xmath2 values assuming no and full redistribution , respectively . generally , decreasing the efficiency of heat redistribution decreases the geometric albedo obtained .",
    "a better approach is to allow for @xmath12 to vary with @xmath3 , since the efficiency of heat redistribution worsens as @xmath3 increases @xcite , but we do not attempt this as the functional form of @xmath33 is not well known .",
    "for this reason , we do not specify the uncertainties associated with the corrected @xmath2 values .",
    "based on the results in figure [ fig : kepdata ] , there are two possible interpretations :    * taken at face value ( without performing a correction for contamination by thermal emission ) , the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 data exhibits a weak correlation ( spearman rank coefficient of 0.6 ) , although the @xmath34 measurement associated with kepler-7b stands out . when we correct for contamination by thermal emission assuming full redistribution ( @xmath35 ) , the @xmath2 values do not change much ( and the spearman rank coefficient remains , to the first significant figure , unchanged ) .",
    "* when the correction is performed assuming no redistribution ( @xmath26 ) , the trend flattens as expected ( with a spearman rank coefficient of @xmath36 ) .",
    "three of the data points are consistent with being zero .",
    "the key point is that the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 can only weaken , and not strengthen , when heat redistribution is taken into account .",
    "our conclusion is that there exists no clear correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "values of @xmath37 may be consistent with rayleigh scattering caused by hydrogen molecules alone @xcite , without the need for the presence of clouds or condensates .",
    "the high geometric albedo associated with kepler-7b ( @xmath38 ) may require an explanation that includes the effects of clouds or condensates @xcite .",
    "unlike other previously examined relationships between various properties of hot jupiters ( e.g. , radius and heat redistribution versus @xmath11 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , there is no clear trend of @xmath2 with the incident stellar flux .",
    "one of the goals of the present study is to suggest that the absence of a clear trend is caused by a combination of opacity effects , possibly due to the presence of condensates or clouds , and atmospheric circulation , the latter of which is often ignored in spectral analyses of hot jupiters .",
    "the study of clouds or hazes is emerging as a major theme in the observations of hot jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite ) and directly - imaged exoplanets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and has long been an obstacle plaguing advances in the understanding of brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the theoretical front ,",
    "several trends are now understood :    * the strength and depth of atmospheric circulation is intimately tied to the intensity of stellar irradiation @xcite .",
    "an  eddy diffusion coefficient \" ( @xmath39 ) is often used to _ mimic _ this behavior , but ultimately the relationship between atmospheric circulation and stellar flux can  and should  be calculated from first principles using global , three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations . * the geometric albedo of an irradiated atmosphere controls not only the amount of starlight penetrating the atmosphere , but also the _ depth _ of the penetration @xcite . * whether a particle embedded in an atmospheric flow is held aloft depends not only on its size and density , but also on the local temperature , pressure and velocity field of the atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance of the particles relative to the atmospheric gas , their sizes and their composition in turn determine the geometric albedo , which controls the heating of the atmosphere .",
    "to date , no model or simulation has succeeded in including all of these effects , which need to be studied in concert in order to gain a global perspective on the atmospheres of irradiated exoplanets .",
    "examining each factor in isolation is reasonable and necessary as an initial step , but the final word will come from studying their complex interplay .",
    "conversely , investing precision in some of these factors at the expense of others may yield misleading results .",
    "we highlight some features of this interplay using an analytical toy model and scaling relations in the hope that it will motivate more sophisticated , follow - up studies .",
    "more succinctly , the goal of the present study is to relate the presence of condensates and their properties with the geometric albedo , the pressure of the atmospheric layer probed by the _",
    "bandpass and the strength of atmospheric circulation , which is tied to the stellar irradiation flux .    to begin , ",

    "we describe our methodology and results .",
    "this study is based on quarters q0 through q14 of _ kepler _ data ( see * ? ? ? * for the q0q8 data release ) that are available at the time of writing . in total , the datasets encompass about 1,250 days of quasi - continuous photometric monitoring between may 2009 and october 2012 .",
    "we retrieved the q0q14 fits files from mast and extracted the raw long - cadence photometry @xcite for each target .",
    "we consider the following 11 giant exoplanets in this study : tres-2b @xcite , hat - p-7b @xcite , kepler-8b @xcite , kepler-6b @xcite , kepler-5b @xcite , kepler-12b @xcite , kepler-7b @xcite , kepler-14b @xcite , kepler-15b @xcite , kepler-41b @xcite and kepler-17b @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to search for the planetary occultation ( whose depth yields @xmath40 ) in the _ kepler _ bandpass and derive the corresponding geometric albedo . to this end",
    ", we employ a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) framework to characterize the posterior distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "mcmc is a bayesian inference method based on stochastic simulations that samples the posterior probability distributions of adjusted parameters for a given model .",
    "our mcmc implementation ( described in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) uses the gibbs sampler and the metropolis - hastings algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution function of all jump parameters .",
    "our nominal model is based on a star and a transiting planet on a keplerian orbit about their center of mass .",
    "input data provided to the mcmc for each system consist of the q0q14 _ kepler _ photometry and the spectroscopic stellar parameters ( effective temperature @xmath5 , metallicity [ fe / h ] and @xmath41 ) published in the references mentioned above .",
    "we correct for the photometric dilution induced by neighbor stellar sources using a quarter - dependent dilution factor based on the dilution values presented in the literature and on the contamination values reported in the fits files headers @xcite .",
    "we divide the total lightcurve in segments of duration of about 24 to 48  hr and fit for each of them the smooth photometric variations due to stellar variability or instrumental systematic effects with a time - dependent quadratic polynomial .",
    "baseline model coefficients are determined at each step of the mcmc for each lightcurve with the singular value decomposition method @xcite .",
    "the resulting coefficients are then used to correct the raw photometric lightcurves .",
    "we assumed a quadratic law for the stellar limb - darkening ( ld ) and used @xmath42 and @xmath43 as jump parameters , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the quadratic coefficients .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 were drawn from the theoretical tables of @xcite for the stellar parameters obtained from the references above .",
    "the mcmc has the following set of jump parameters : the planet / star flux ratio , the impact parameter @xmath46 , the transit duration from first to fourth contact , the time of minimum light @xmath47 , the orbital period , the occultation depth , the two ld combinations @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the latter two parameters allow to fit for the occultation phase and width .",
    "a uniform prior distribution is assumed for all jump parameters but @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for which a normal prior distribution is used , based on theoretical tables and the stellar parameters used as input data to the mcmc fit .",
    "we run two markov chains of 100,000 steps each .",
    "the good mixing and convergence of the chains are assessed using the gelman - rubin statistic criterion @xcite .",
    "we use the posterior distribution functions for the jump parameters @xmath40 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 obtained from the mcmc to derive the geometric albedo posteriors for each planet .",
    "we show the median of the posterior distribution function and its associated 1-@xmath54 probability interval for @xmath2 and @xmath15 in table  [ tab : data ] .    as already mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : intro ] , the non - parametric spearman rank coefficient is 0.6 for the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 data shown in figure [ fig : kepdata ] .",
    "values of @xmath55 indicate a perfectly monotonically increasing or decreasing trend , while those close to zero indicate no correlation between the two quantities .",
    "any model constructed to describe clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres has to include both their radiative and dynamical effects .",
    "even when clouds contribute negligible mass to the atmosphere , they introduce strong radiative forcing to it in the form of the reflection of incident starlight ( cooling ) and the retention of reprocessed starlight in the infrared ( heating ) . on earth , these two significant effects almost cancel , but not quite  it is this imperfect cancellation that is important for determining details of the terrestrial weather and climate system . getting these details correct to high precision remains a formidable challenge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . clouds also interact with the atmospheric flow . to first order , we may neglect the dynamical effects of clouds on the flow ( unless the dust - to - gas ratio is close to unity ) , but we may not neglect the dynamical effects of the flow on the clouds .",
    "atmospheric circulation sets the background state of velocity , temperature , pressure and density  and all of its dependent quantities  that allows us to determine if a cloud particle will remain at a certain location in the atmosphere .",
    "to place the present study in context , we note that the 3d simulations of @xcite examine the effects of the atmospheric flow on embedded tracers that mimic the presence of cloud particles , but these tracers do not feed back on the flow in any way , both dynamically and radiatively .",
    "by contrast , the 3d simulations of @xcite include an extra opacity source to describe rayleigh scattering , but do not consider the interaction between the flow and embedded particles .",
    "it is practically impossible to include all of these effects in an analytical model in any rigorous manner .",
    "instead , we subsume the absorptivity of the clouds into a general , infrared , absorption opacity that also describes the atmospheric gas . the geometric albedo is a consequence of the scattering and absorption properties of the atmosphere , as we will discuss in  [ subsect : albedo ] . while being mindful of this fact , we prescribe the geometric albedo as a free parameter when computing the analytical temperature - pressure profile . to describe the action of the atmospheric flow on the cloud particles",
    ", we use an analytical expression for the local terminal velocity of a given cloud particle and approximate the vertical velocity of the flow to be a fixed fraction of the local sound speed . finally , we discuss the relationship between the properties of the cloud particles and the albedo .",
    "we use analytical models of the temperature - pressure profiles of hot jupiters in the present study from @xcite , where the cloudfree models of @xcite were generalized to include a non - zero albedo . whether the albedo is due to rayleigh scattering associated with molecules or scattering associated with condensates or dust grains is unspecified . these models",
    "solve the one - dimensional ( 1d ) radiative transfer equation in the plane - parallel , two - stream approximation using the method of moments , while the incoming stellar radiation is approximated as a collimated beam .",
    "the free parameters involved are the irradiation temperature ( @xmath8 ) , the bond albedo ( @xmath19 ) , the absorption opacity in the infrared ( @xmath56 ) and the absorption opacity in the optical ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we set collision - induced absorption , associated with hydrogen molecules , to be the dominant opacity source at pressures of 0.1 bar and greater ( @xmath58 for a bottom pressure of 10 bar ) .",
    "there is an option to specify a purely - absorbing cloud deck of intermediate width , which we ignore for the purpose of simplicity and clarity .",
    "starlight incident upon an atmosphere is predominantly absorbed at the following pressure level , known as the  photon deposition layer \" @xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the surface gravity of the exoplanet . in a purely reflecting atmosphere ( @xmath61 ) , there is no penetration of starlight ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "note that this unique relationship between the photon deposition layer and the bond albedo only exists in the limit of uniform , vertical populations of scatterers and absorbers in the 1d model atmosphere .",
    "when the assumption of spatial uniformity is relaxed , this unique relationship is broken and it is now possible to specify cloud decks of varying spatial and optical thicknesses , located at different altitudes , that will produce the same bond albedo . while being aware of this possibility , we do not explore this complexity for several reasons : we are interested in elucidating trends , rather than making detailed predictions ; to develop intuition , we confine ourselves to analytical models as much as possible , and it has been previously shown that such a generalization breaks the analytical nature of the model for the temperature - pressure profile @xcite ; the atmospheric data associated with hot jupiters is not ( yet ) of a high enough quality to warrant such sophisticated investigations ( unlike , for example , in the case of brown dwarfs ) .",
    "in this sub - section , we use simple scaling relations to elucidate the relationship between vertical , atmospheric flow and its ability to loft condensates .",
    "the mean free path of molecules within an atmosphere is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mean molecular mass , @xmath65 is the mass density and @xmath66 @xmath67 is the cross section for inter - molecular interactions . to describe the influence of the atmospheric flow on a particle embedded within it , we use the analytical formulae previously described in @xcite and @xcite ( and references therein ) .",

    "the kinematic viscosity of the atmospheric gas is @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the local sound speed .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is a correction factor accounting for the enhancement of the terminal velocity in rarefied media , @xmath74,\\ ] ] and depends on the knudsen number , @xmath75 which in turn depends on the pressure level ( @xmath76 ) and local temperature ( @xmath77 ) of the atmosphere considered .",
    "the boltzmann constant is given by @xmath78 .",
    "we define a quantity @xmath79 , which describes whether a particle is likely to be lofted by atmospheric circulation .",
    "we approximate the vertical component of the velocity to be @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the adiabatic gas index . the vertical mach number @xmath82 is approximated to be constant , although we fully anticipate that it generally has the functional form @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that @xmath84 when @xmath85 , atmospheric circulation keeps the particles lofted . when @xmath86 , the particles sink under the action of gravity .",
    "we expect @xmath87 . when @xmath88 , we get @xmath89 . in the limit of @xmath90",
    ", we obtain @xmath91 we thus expect micron - sized particles to be lofted by atmospheric circulation .",
    "to obtain the correct order - of - magnitude value for @xmath82 , we use the 3d simulations of atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters by @xcite .",
    "further details are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , we employ their models c (  cold \" ) , w (  warm \" ) and h (  hot \" ) , which have @xmath92 , 969 and 1723 k , respectively . for each model",
    ", we also examine atmospheres with ( @xmath93 ) and without ( @xmath94 ) temperature inversions . in figure",
    "[ fig : vert ] , we show the root - mean - square ( rms ) vertical velocity ( @xmath95 ) and vertical mach number ( @xmath96 ) as functions of the vertical pressure @xmath76 .",
    "we see that at @xmath97 bar , we have @xmath98 with a somewhat weak dependence on the equilibrium temperature and the absence or presence of a temperature inversion .",
    "a caveat is that the simulations of @xcite essentially assume @xmath0 and do not include a treatment of scattering .",
    "secondly , like most other published general circulation models ( gcms ) of hot jupiters , they solve the primitive equations of meteorology , which assumes hydrostatic balance .",
    "hydrostatic balance does not preclude @xmath99 , since the vertical velocity is assumed to be sub - dominant only in the vertical component of the momentum equation , but it does imply that any simulated value is probably a lower limit to the one obtained by a fully non - hydrostatic simulation . it is with these caveats that we adopt @xmath100 at @xmath101 bar .",
    "since we are interpreting @xmath102 to be the rms vertical velocity in equations ( [ eq : vz ] ) , ( [ eq : s ] ) and ( [ eq : s2 ] ) , @xmath103 may be interpreted as the relative abundance of embedded cloud particles summed horizontally over an entire atmospheric layer .",
    "the scattering and absorption properties of cloud particles are mainly described by two quantities .",
    "the first quantity is the  single scattering albedo \" : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the scattering and absorption cross sections , respectively .",
    "the second quantity is the  asymmetry parameter \" ( @xmath107 ) , which is the mean cosine of the relative angle between the initial and scattered directions of a photon incident upon the particle .",
    "it is the sole parameter in the henyey - greenstein scattering phase function , which determines the spatial distribution of scattered light @xcite .",
    "isotropic scattering occurs for @xmath108 .",
    "particles described by @xmath109 produce predominantly forward scattering , while those described by @xmath110 produce mostly backward scattering .",
    "generally , @xmath111 and @xmath107 depend on both the particle radius ( @xmath70 ) and the wavelength considered ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "asymptotically , we expect that ( e.g. ,  5.4 of @xcite ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant .",

    "there are two possible configurations of @xmath202 that will produce a sinusoidal functional form for @xmath186 with a peak that is offset from the secondary eclipse .",

    "the second configuration is for @xmath203 , with @xmath204 being the longitude of the exoplanet and @xmath205 being a constant offset , which also produces a sinusoidal function for @xmath186 . in the right circumstances ( i.e. , @xmath162 @xmath21 m ) , the variation in temperature and pressure may cause @xmath186 to possess values ranging from 0.1 to 1 .",
    "such a variation in @xmath186 produces a longitudinal variation in the abundance of lofted cloud particles , which in turn produces a longitudinal variation in the associated albedo and the flux of reflected starlight .",
    "the observations of kepler-7b @xcite are consistent with such a scenario . by contrast , if small cloud particles ( @xmath90 ) are embedded in the atmosphere of kepler-12b , we expect @xmath190 , which produces a flat phase curve for a given albedo value if the opacity in the optical range of wavelengths is roughly constant with longitude .",
    "in other words , when small grains are present , we expect their abundance to be zonally uniform ; if @xmath60 , @xmath57 and @xmath2 are constant , then @xmath181 and hence @xmath186 are constant across longitude .",
    "small particles are consistent with a lower albedo if @xmath206 .",
    "however , there is an important detail in the optical phase curve of kepler-7b that is difficult to reconcile with our simple explanation .",
    "the peak of the optical phase curve peaks _ after _ secondary eclipse , implying that the corresponding brightness map peaks _ westwards _ of the substellar point @xcite . irradiated atmospheres in the hot jupiter regime are expected to possess temperature maps that peak _ eastwards _ of the substellar point @xcite , a theoretical expectation that is corroborated by 3d simulations of atmospheric circulation . that this property is independent of whether newtonian cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , dual - band radiative transfer @xcite or multi - wavelength radiative transfer @xcite is utilized suggests that it is a robust outcome of the hot jupiter regime .",
    "if an infrared phase curve of kepler-7b is measured with this property ( eastward shift ) , then it is a  smoking gun \" for the presence of condensates  reflected light and thermal emission are not tracing each other , implying that the spatial distribution of the condensates is being modified by atmospheric dynamics .",
    "several caveats and unexplored aspects provide opportunities for future work .",
    "we have not used an eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath39 ) to mimic atmospheric circulation and instead approximated the vertical velocity as a fixed fraction of the local sound speed .",
    "while such an approach includes the effect of varying the stellar irradiation , since it is tied to the temperature - pressure profile , it fails to capture the dependence of the _ depth _ of atmospheric circulation on the incident stellar flux @xcite .",
    "the vigor of atmospheric circulation in irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres means that if clouds form , they will be well - mixed from @xmath207 mbar all the way down to @xmath171 bar , depending on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "performing 3d simulations of atmospheric circulation with a diversity of cloud configurations will inform 1d models on how to  paint \" clouds onto their @xmath77-@xmath76 profiles .",
    "another important interplay we have not explored concerns atmospheric chemistry . specifically , the strength and spectral distribution of the incident stellar flux modifies the absorption ( @xmath57 ) and scattering ( @xmath2 ) properties of both the condensates and the gas in the irradiated atmosphere . to understand the lofting behavior of small cloud particles as a function of the incident stellar flux requires this interplay to be elucidated .    in recent years",
    ", retrieval models , originally developed for the modestly - irradiated planets / moons of the solar system , have been employed to infer the temperature - pressure profiles and atmospheric chemistry / composition of hot jupiters @xcite . while being an important development in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres , these published works have so far been  blue sky \" and omitted the effects of clouds .",
    "@xcite specify the albedo as a free parameter in their analysis , but only include one of its effects as suggested by their use of the @xcite model : the diminution of the incident stellar flux , but not the modification of its vertical absorption profile .",
    "they also allow for the cloud - top pressure to be a fitting parameter . to illustrate the importance of including a non - zero albedo , consider the limiting case of @xmath208 , in which case we expect the photon deposition layer to reside at the top of the atmosphere and for the infrared photosphere to be undefined ( if interior heat from the irradiated exoplanet is negligible ) .",
    "when the geometric albedo is just below unity , we expect the infrared photosphere(s ) to be located just below the top of the atmosphere .",
    "when @xmath0 , the contribution functions are correctly computed by the published retrieval models . since we expect physical quantities to vary continuously , the contribution functions , at various infrared wavelengths , should shift to lower pressures as @xmath2 increases , an effect that needs to be included in the retrieval models .",
    "future work that includes a simple model of clouds , with a small number of free parameters , in the retrieval technique will set some empirical constraints on the cloud properties , although some degeneracy is anticipated .",
    "while 3d simulations that treat only the dynamical or radiative interaction between the atmospheric flow and the cloud particles are insufficient for a full understanding of the effects of clouds in irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres , neither is a 1d analytical model that employs simple , approximate treatments for these effects , as presented in this study .",
    "nevertheless , both approaches drive us toward constructing falsifiable models that are realistic yet simple enough to be confronted by observations and feasibly included in future 3d simulations .",
    "to provide an executive summary of the observational relevance of our study , we highlight a few scenarios and suggest possible ( and possibly non - unique ) interpretations . when the peak amplitude of the phase curve is on the order of the occultation depth , then we term it to be  sinusoidal \" ; if not , we term it to be  flat \" .",
    "when the angular offset of the peak of the phase curve from secondary eclipse is @xmath209 or close to zero , we term it to be  small \" .",

    "this is consistent with the low intensity of stellar irradiation impinging upon its atmosphere ( @xmath212 k ) .",
    "transit observations in the ultraviolet and optical range of wavelengths reveal a spectral slope , punctuated by sodium lines , consistent with rayleigh scattering by condensates present at the day - night terminators @xcite .",
    "that the infrared peak offsets are not small suggests that the albedo associated with the condensates is small , or even close to zero , at and near the peak of the stellar spectrum . based on a tentative comparison of several brightness temperature points with an analytical temperature - pressure profile , @xcite estimate that the bond albedo of hd 189733b is about 0.1 .",
