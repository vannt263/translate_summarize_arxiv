    "@xmath7 is in state @xmath8 , jobs arrive according to a poisson process with rate @xmath9 , while the departure rate is given by @xmath10 . the resulting markov - modulated infinite - server queue has attracted some attention during the past decades ; see e.g.  the early contributions @xcite . in these papers",
    "the main results were in terms of systems of ( partial ) differential equations characterizing probability generating functions related to the system s transient behavior , and recursions enabling the evaluation of the corresponding moments .    in a series of recent papers @xcite ,",
    "substantial attention has been paid to the asymptotic behavior of markov - modulated infinite - server queues in specific scaling regimes . in these parameter scalings",
    "the arrival rates are typically inflated by a factor @xmath1 , while the transition rates of the background process are sped up by a factor @xmath2 for some @xmath11 .",
    "the objective is to analyze the transient distribution of the number of jobs in the system at time @xmath12 , to be denoted by @xmath13 , in the limiting regime that @xmath1 grows large .",
    "the asymptotic results derived come in three flavors : ( i )  large deviations ( ld ) results , describing the tail probabilities @xmath14 for @xmath1 large ; ( ii )  central - limit - theorem ( clt ) type of results , describing the convergence of @xmath13 ( after centering and normalization ) to a normally distributed random variable ; and ( iii )  functional central limit theorems ( fclts ) , describing the convergence of the process @xmath15 to an appropriate gaussian process .    importantly , two model variants can be distinguished , with their own specific departure processes .",
    "* in the first , to be referred to as model i , each job present is experiencing a departure rate @xmath10 when @xmath7 is in state @xmath8 ; as a consequence , this hazard rate may change during the job s sojourn time ( when the background process makes a transition ) . * in the second , model ii , the job s sojourn time is sampled upon arrival : when the background process is then in state @xmath8 , it has an exponential distribution with mean @xmath16 , and hence the corresponding hazard rate is constant over its lifetime .",
    "[ figschema ] summarizes the results that have been established so far . in the ld domain ,",
    "the papers @xcite cover , for both models , the regime in which the background process is relatively slow ( more specifically , @xmath17 ) as well as the regime in which it is essentially faster than the arrival process ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "also in the clt regime the picture is complete , with results for models i and ii , and with both slow ( @xmath5 ) and fast ( @xmath4 ) switching of the background process . in terms of fclts , however , not all cases are covered : the only result derived so far @xcite concerns the case that @xmath18 for all @xmath8 , i.e. , the case in which models i and ii actually coincide ; we may refer to this model as to ` model  0 ' .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is the derivation of fclts for models i and ii ; this is done in sections 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "these findings , with a limiting gaussian process of the ornstein - uhlenbeck type , turn out to be in accordance with explicit expressions for means , variances , and covariances in these models , as we present in sections  3  and  4 .",
