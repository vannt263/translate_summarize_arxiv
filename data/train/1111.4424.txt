    "this is due to two main factors .",
    "first , the main pathway for the formation of h@xmath1d@xmath119 , the parent molecule of deuterated molecules , is exothermic by 230 k , and the backward reaction is not available .",
    "second , co will freeze out at temperatures below 20 k , removing the main destroyer of h@xmath1d@xmath119 .",
    "however , n@xmath1 should also freeze out at essentially the same rate at co at @xmath020 k , so the picture is not so simple .",
    "a number of more subtle factors that affect the d / h ratio , such as grain size ( surface chemistry ) , ionization rate , ortho - to - para h@xmath1 value , and the co depletion factor are examined in detail by caselli et al .",
    "they show that the d / h ratio can still be relatively high near 20 k , but drops sharply at @xmath015 k. one obvious explanation for the relatively high values of d / h in n6 may be temperatures a few degrees lower than 20 k , but the complete reason for the high d / h values is likely to be more complicated .",
    "the d / h ratio is largest away from the dust temperature peak , to the nw , and pon et al .",
    "( 2009 ) do infer a radial temperature drop .",
    "thus , n6 appears to be denser and smaller than starless cores in both cluster - forming and isolated environments . while a very small number of cluster - cores have a similar size , no isolated core does , and no starless core has a mean density as high .",
    "starless cores have typically been modeled with spherically symmetric geometries , with a radial density profile that is almost constant at small radii but decrease as a power law at larger radii ( ward - thompson et al.1994 , 1999 ; bacmann et al .",
    "2000 ; evans et al .  2001",
    "; kandori et al .  2005 ; j.  kirk et al .",
    "however , n6 is clearly elongated , with an aspect ratio of at least 2:1 , as observed in many cores ( myers et al .",
    "1991 ; ryden 1996 ) , suggesting that it is prolate or filamentary in nature . over its half - maximum size",
    "its dust temperature is fairly uniform at about 20 k , to within 1 - 2 k , decreasing at larger distances ( pon et al .",
    "we have thus compared the column density profile of n6 to that of an isothermal cylinder ( ostriker 1964 ; curry 2000 ) , finding an extremely good match between the data and the model ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cylinder ] ) .",
    "the mass of the isothermal model cylinder is @xmath133 , similar to the observationally derived mass of 0.3 , given the uncertainties in the input values ( cylinder size , column density per pixel , temperature ) .",
    "similarly , the critical mass for fragmentation of an isothermal filament with properties similar to those of n6 is @xmath134  ( larson 1985 ) , also close to the observational value given the uncertainties ( in particular as the observed value of mass depends on column density , whereas the critical cylinder mass depends on its inverse ) .",
    "the excellent match between the column density profile of n6 and the isothermal cylinder model , and the similarity of the observed mass to the mass of an isothermal filament with the properties of n6 , strongly suggest that n6 has formed via fragmentation of the oph a filament , and is in a critical state at the beginning of star formation , or has already started the star - formation process ( as evidenced by the low - mass compact dust continuum emission ) .",
    "n6 is aligned with its parent core , oph a , supporting the view that it has formed as the result of fragmentation of oph a along its axis .",
    "although non - spherically symmetric models are rarely used , they have been quite successful in explaining the observed elongated structure of dense cores and filamentary nature of molecular clouds ( harvey et al .  2003b ; johnstone et al .",
    "it has also been shown that the density profiles of collapsing centrally condensed (  bonner - ebert \" ) spheres and cylinders are remarkably similar , and distinguishing between these cases observationally , using only column density maps , may not be possible ( myers 2005 ) .",
    "resorting to the ease of using spherical models without considering alternatives should be avoided , a message that is often given without heed ( hartmann 2004 ) .",
    "harvey et al .  ( 2003b ) performed a detailed study of the isolated starless core l694 - 2 , through near - infrared extinction mapping .",
    "they found that spherical models where the radial density profile is described by a power - law , or a bonnor - ebert sphere , did not provide accurate matches to the data .",
    "instead they found that a cylindrical model , like that described here , provided an excellent fit to their data . in the case of l694 - 2",
    ", the cylinder is inclined to the line - of - sight , so initially it was not obvious that a cylindrical model was needed .",
    "the steep power - law index that best matched the data , significantly steeper than predicted by inside - out collapse , motivated the cylindrical model .",
    "many distant infrared dark clouds and nearby star - forming complexes have filamentary or elongated structures ( schneider & elmegreen 1979 ; myers 2009 ) , and in at least one case , that of the infrared dark cloud g11.11 - 0.12 , the radial profile of 850  emission closely matches that of an isothermal filament of radius @xmath135 0.1 pc over a length of more than 10 pc ( johnstone et al .  2003 ) . while many molecular clouds have been compared to models of infinite or finite sheets , models of individual clouds as cylinders are almost absent , although theoretical studies suggest that such models could provide good matches to available data ( curry 2000 ) .",
    "new results from the herschel space observatory show filamentary structures in nearby molecular clouds ( andr et al .  2010 ;",
    "arzoumanian et al .",
    "2011 ) , and modelling suggests radial profiles much shallower than isothermal cylinders , at radii @xmath5 0.1 pc . at such large radii",
    "the assumptions of constant temperature and/or hydrostatic equilibrium are unlikely , so this result is not surprising .",
    "the observations do not have the resolution to probe scales similar to that of n6 .",
    "the profiles could be consistent with collapsing polytropic cylinders ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "2011 ) , or magnetized filaments in virial equilibrium ( fiege & pudritz 2000 )",
    ". it will be interesting to observe cores within these filaments with finer resolution to study their structure .",
    "the physical , kinematic , and chemical properties of dense cores have been used to assess their evolutionary state ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1999 ; crapsi et al .",
    "2005 ; di francesco et al .",
    "crapsi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) searched for evolutionary indicators in a sample of 31 isolated cores , using observations of n@xmath1h@xmath2 , n@xmath1d@xmath2 , co and the dust continuum .",
    "they proposed eight chemical and kinematic evolutionary indicators , and identified as  evolved \" those cores that met at least four of the conditions .",
    "these conditions include large column densities of n@xmath1h@xmath2  and n@xmath1d@xmath2 , a large deuterium fraction , large co depletion and central density , broad linewidths , infall asymmetry in the line profiles , and compact central regions . all of these conditions , with the exception of co depletion , can be tested in n6 with our data .",
    "the peak column densities of n@xmath1h@xmath2  ( @xmath77 ) and n@xmath1d@xmath2(@xmath62 ) are greater than the dividing values given by crapsi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , of @xmath136  and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the peak of the deuterium fraction , 0.15 , is greater than the value of 0.1 used by crapsi et al .",
    "to separate candidate prestellar cores from starless cores . the peak density",
    "we determine , @xmath138 , is far greater than the separator of @xmath139  used by crapsi et al .",
    ", as is the degree of central concentration ( this is not a function of resolution , as the single dish data have been included in our results ) .",
    "the narrow line widths , and hyperfine structure , makes the search for line skewness difficult . as mentioned , pon et al .",
    "( 2009 ) observe infall asymmetry in hco@xmath119 , so there is some evidence of contraction in n6 .",
    "however , the n@xmath1h@xmath2  and n@xmath1d@xmath2  lines widths are of similar size to the separating value of 0.25  used by crapsi et al .",
    "so of the seven evolutionary indicators we can measure , five clearly indicate that n6 is an evolved prestellar core , according to the analysis of crapsi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , while the other two indicators are borderline ( line widths ) or unclear ( infall asymmetry or line skewness ) .",
    "these results strongly suggest that n6 is at an advanced stage of prestellar evolution .",
    "the compact dust continuum emission further supports this idea .",
    "we have presented high spatial ( @xmath3500 au ) and spectral ( 0.07 ) resolution observations in n@xmath1h@xmath2  3 - 2 , n@xmath1d@xmath2  3 - 2 , and the dust continuum at 1-mm , of the starless core oph a - n6 , embedded within the oph a molecular ridge in the ophuichus cluster - forming molecular cloud .",
    "these are the highest resolution observations of a starless dense core presented to date .",
    "such a small condensation as n6 would be hard to detect with coarser angular resolution observations , especially in clouds much more distant than ophiuchus .      1 .",
    "the observations reveal a compact dust continuum peak , of size @xmath31000 au and mass 0.005 - 0.01 , not seen in single dish observations , except in a dust temperature map ( pon et al .",
    "the small size and mass suggests it might be the first indication of collapse , either representing a temperature increase , or possibly a first hydrostatic core .",
    "the size of n6 from the line observations is larger , with a projected half - power diameter of @xmath140 au , and thus an aspect ratio of 2:1 .",
    "the n@xmath1h@xmath2  and n@xmath1d@xmath2  integrated line maps show slightly different position angles , probably representing chemical variations , or the very high optical depth in n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "very little variation is seen in either linewidth or line center velocity in either line across their maps .",
    "the variations are so small that n6 appears to be a coherent core , with very small non - thermal motions .",
    "the peak column densities are @xmath77  for n@xmath1h@xmath2 , and @xmath62  for n@xmath1d@xmath2 .",
    "the positions of peak column density are offset , with the n@xmath1d@xmath2  peak located to the nw of the n@xmath1h@xmath2peak .",
    "5 .   the deuterium fraction has a peak value of 0.15 , and is greater than or about equal to 0.05 over much of the mapped area .",
    "the maximum value of deuteration lies in the nw , and not at the position of the dust continuum peak , nor the n@xmath1h@xmath2  peak .",
    "the column density profile of n6 across its minor axis , as determined from the n@xmath1h@xmath2  observations , is very well represented by an isothermal cylinder ( at 20 k ) , of peak density @xmath141 , and n@xmath1h@xmath2abundance @xmath7 .",
    "the mass of n6 , determined from the mapped positions , lies in the range 0.25 - 0.34 , depending strongly on the assumed n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the low value compares favourably to the mass determined from the cylindrical analysis , of @xmath133 , while the high value compares well to the critical mass for fragmentation of an isothermal filament with similar properties , of @xmath134 .",
    "compared to isolated low - mass cores , oph a - n6 shows similar narrow line widths and small velocity variation , with a deuterium fraction that is similar to  evolved \" dense cores .",
    "it is significantly smaller than isolated cores , with larger peak column density and volume density , while the previously measured kinetic temperature is significantly higher than isolated starless cores .",
    "these results strongly suggest oph a - n6 has formed from the fragmentation of the oph a filament , and is a precursor to a low - mass star in a cluster - forming region .",
