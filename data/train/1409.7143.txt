    "methanol masers are commonly found in star - forming regions , and are used as indicators of star formation activity ( menten 1991a ) .",
    "methanol masers can be classified into two classes : class i and ii ( batrla et al .",
    "1987 ; menten 1991a ) .",
    "class i methanol masers are recognized as shock excited masers , while class ii methanol masers are pumped by infrared radiation . although the classification of each maser type was originally based on emitting regions of the masers , slysh et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and kurtz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) pointed out that the definition is better based on transitions .",
    "it is well established that class ii methanol masers are exclusive tracers of high - mass star formation ( e.g. , menten 1991b ; minier et al . 2003 ; ellingsen 2007 ; sugiyama et al .",
    "in contrast , class i methanol maser emission is found both in high - mass ( e.g. , kurtz et al .",
    "2004 ) and low - mass ( e.g. , kalenskii et al . 2010 ) star forming regions .",
    "class i methanol masers are usually associated with molecular outflows ( e.g. kurtz et al .",
    "2004 ; chen et al .",
    "plambeck & menten ( 1990 ) and cyganowski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that class i methanol maser emission comes from the interface between outflows and ambient dense gas .",
    "in addition , class i methanol masers are also found toward ultracompact h ii regions ( e.g. fontani et al .",
    "2010 ; voronkov et al .",
    "2010 ) , where shocks caused by expansion of the ultracompact h ii regions are responsible for excitation .",
    "thus , class i methanol masers are thought to be good tracers of various shocks .",
    "although class i methanol masers are thought to trace shocked regions , their peak velocities are usually similar to that of the ambient dense gas ( e.g. menten 1991a ) . a relationship between the maser emitting regions and the ambient dense gas is not very clear due to a lack of high spatial resolution observations . in this letter , we have studied the relationship between class i methanol maser emission and dense molecular gas toward g34.43 + 00.24 mm3 at sub - arcsecond resolution with atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "g34.43 + 00.24 is an infrared dark cloud ( irdc ; garay et al .",
    "2004 ; rathborne et al .",
    "2006 ; sanhueza et al .",
    "2010 ) , which contains 9 molecular clumps ( mm1-mm9 ; rathborne et al .",
    "the distance to this object is derived to be 1.56 kpc from vlbi parallax observations ( kurayama et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the distance derived by using the galactic rotation curve ( e.g. , sakai et al . 2008 ; sanhueza et al . 2012 ) and near - infrared extinction ( foster et al .",
    "2012 ) ranges around 3 - 4 kpc .",
    "this discrepancy is discussed in detail by foster et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "an ultracompact h ii region is associated with mm2 .",
    "thus , this cloud is forming at least one , and probably several , high - mass stars .",
    "g34.43 + 00.24 mm3 is the third most massive clump in this irdc .",
    "mm3 is less luminous in the infrared than mm1 and mm2 , and is associated with a dark extinction region in the spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath10 m images .",
    "there is no ultracompact h ii region in mm3 .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "( 2013 ; paper i ) identified a very young hot core / outflow system in mm3 by using alma .",
    "in addition , they found a possible evidence for past star formation activities , and suggested that this clump has already actively formed low - mass stars .",
    "recently , foster et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found another evidence of star formation activity in this clump from near - infrared @xmath11-band observations .",
    "thus , mm3 is a good target to investigate the relationship between star formation activity and class i methanol masers . although chambers et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported the detection of 25 ghz class i methanol masers toward this source by using the green bank telescope , high - resolution observations of the class i methanol masers have not been reported so far .",
    "we observed the ch@xmath0oh @xmath1=@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 line toward g34.43 + 00.24 mm3 by using alma .",
    "the @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath4 lines of ch@xmath0oh are likely to be a class i maser line ( e.g. , voronkov et al . 2012 ) .",
    "we compare the emission from the methanol masers with that of n@xmath14h@xmath15 and cs , in addition to shock - tracing molecules , such as sio and thermal ch@xmath0oh , in order to investigate the emitting regions of the class i methanol masers .",
    "although zinchenko et al .",

    "the spatial distributions of ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 and ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath4 look similar to that of ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 , except that the @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 and @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath4 emission is more extended . in figure 2",
    ", we present the spectra of all three methanol transitions .",

    "assuming optically thin emission and local thermodynamic equilibrium excitation , we calculate the excitation temperature from the intensity ratios of ( @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath4)/(@xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4)/(@xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 ) at the peak velocity of the @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 emission .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "the excitation temperatures derived from the ( @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath4)/(@xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 ) ratio range from 19 k to 40 k , while the excitation temperatures derived from the ( @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4)/(@xmath5-@xmath6 @xmath4 ) ratio are negative .",
    "this indicates population inversion for the @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 transition .",
    "the compact distribution , the narrow velocity width , and the population inversion indicate that the observed ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 emission is maser emission .",
    "in contrast to the 6 peaks , toward the hot core , the peak intensity of @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 is weaker than that of @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 and @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath4 ( figures 1 and 2 ) . at this position , the excitation temperature derived from the ( @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4)/(@xmath5-@xmath6 @xmath4 ) ratio is 79 k. thus , maser emission is either absent or very weak toward the hot core .",

    "the cs emission is likely tracing outflows ( paper i ) .",
    "all of the ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 peaks are indeed associated with the cs outflows , and some peaks are located on the edge of the cs outflows .",
    "figure 1f shows the color image of 2.2 @xmath10 m @xmath11-band from keck telescope ( paper i ) overlaid with the cs contours .",
    "diffuse @xmath11-band emission due to the h@xmath14 line at 2.12 @xmath10 m ( foster et al .",
    "2014 ) is seen near m2 and m3 .",
    "voronkov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also reported class i ch@xmath0oh masers associated with h@xmath14 emission toward the high - mass source , iras 16547 - 4247 .",
    "in addition , cyganowski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported that methanol masers are seen on the edge of the extended green objects or `` green fuzzies '' , which are diffuse sources with a 4.5 @xmath10 m excess likely due to shock excited h@xmath14 lines .",
    "m2 and m3 are probably similar to such situations .",
    "although h@xmath14 emission is not seen toward the northern outflow lobe , this is likely due to dust extinction as pointed out in paper i.    in figure 1f , we also find that none of the methanol masers peaks are associated with infrared point sources .",
    "although infrared emission is seen toward m2 , this is extended emission and not a point source . in particular",
    ", no infrared emission is observed near m5 , where the maser emission is the brightest .",
    "we have checked that there is no peak of @xmath24 24 @xmath10 m toward m5 .",
    "thus , the maser emission does not originate from regions very close to luminous young stellar objects .",
    "this is consistent with a well known characteristic of class i methanol masers ( menten 1991a ) ; they are collisionally excited rather than ir pumped .      to make the emitting regions of ch@xmath0oh @xmath1=@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 clear , we present velocity channel maps of ch@xmath0oh @xmath1=@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 , cs @xmath9=54 and n@xmath14h@xmath15 @xmath9=32 ( figure 3 ) , where the n@xmath14h@xmath15 data is presented in t. sakai et al .",

    "the n@xmath14h@xmath15 emission is known to trace cold gas ( e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ) . at the velocity range of 58 - 60 km s@xmath18",
    ", we can see an anti - correlation between the n@xmath14h@xmath15 and cs emission .",
    "this indicates an interaction between the outflow and ambient dense gas , which is discussed in t. sakai et al .",
    "( 2014 ; in preparation ) . in the panel at 58.07 km s@xmath18 , we can see the strong peak of the ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 emission toward the m1 position .",
    "this peak is clearly located on the edge of the n@xmath14h@xmath15 emission .",
    "thus , the maser emission comes from the interacting regions between the outflow and ambient cold dense gas .    in figures 4a and 4b ,",
    "we show the position - velocity ( pv ) maps of cs and sio each overlaid on n@xmath14h@xmath15 and ch@xmath0oh @xmath1 = @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 through the cut labeled # 1 in figure 1e .",
    "as reported in paper i , the cs and sio emission is broad ( @xmath25@xmath225 km s@xmath18 ) toward the shocked regions . in these figures ,",
    "the peak position of the methanol maser is almost spatially coincident with those of the cs and sio emission , and it is offset from the n@xmath14h@xmath15 peak .",
    "thus , it is likely that the methanol maser emission comes from the post - shocked gas near the shock front .    in figures 4a and 4b , the peak velocity of the methanol maser line is almost coincident with that of the n@xmath14h@xmath15 line .",
    "in addition , the methanol maser emission is not strong in the broad high velocity components . in figure 4c",
    ", we present the pv map of the methanol thermal transition @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath4 . in this figure",
    ", the methanol thermal line is not strong in the broad components either , as compared with the sio and cs lines .",
    "the intensity ratio of the thermal ch@xmath0oh and sio emission is different by more than one order of magnitude between the narrow and broad components .",
    "this may indicate that the abundance of ch@xmath0oh is relatively low in the broad components .",
    "thus , the weakness of the maser emission in the broad components could originate from the less abundance ch@xmath0oh .",
    "it seems likely that ch@xmath0oh is destroyed in high velocity shocks .",
    "in fact , garay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that the ch@xmath0oh molecule is destroyed for shock velocities above 10 km s@xmath18 .    in figure 3 ,",
    "strong methanol maser emission is seen toward m4 and m5 at the panel of 59.27 km s@xmath18 .",
    "however , we can not see a clear interaction between the outflow and the cold dense gas toward m5 . in figures 4d - f",
    ", we present the pv maps through the cut labeled # 2 in figure 1e . in figures 4d - f , the methanol maser emission is found to be distributed along the n@xmath14h@xmath15 lane . toward m4 ,",
    "the methanol maser peak is almost coincident with the n@xmath14h@xmath15 peak .",
    "although n@xmath14h@xmath15 emission is not seen toward m5 , the peak velocity of the methanol maser emission agrees well with that of the n@xmath14h@xmath15 lane .",
    "thus , we suggest that the methanol maser emission at m5 is also related to the interaction between the cold ambient gas and some star formation activity .",
    "here , we discuss the origin of the ch@xmath0oh maser emission toward m5 , the strongest maser in this source . toward m5 ,",
    "the sio emission is very weak ( figure 4e ) , although the methanol thermal emission is rather strong ( figure 4f ) .",
    "such a trend is also seen toward m6 ( figures 4h-4i ) .",
    "these characteristics are different from those observed in m1-m4 .",
    "since the upper state energy and the critical density are comparable between the observed sio and ch@xmath0oh lines , this difference is likely to reflect a difference in their abundances . although the sio emission is also weak toward the hot core , as compared with the methanol thermal emission ( see also paper i ) , no methanol masers are detected toward the hot core .",
    "thus , the situation is probably different between the hot core and m5 .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh molecule is mainly formed on grain surface , while si exists mainly in dust cores . although si is also thought to exist in ice mantles , the abundance would be much lower than that in dust cores ( jimnez - serra et al .",
    "the radiation from ysos can sublimate ch@xmath0oh from the ice mantles at @xmath2290 k , but evaporation of dust cores requires much higher temperature ( @xmath221000 k ) . toward the hot core ,",
    "the methanol emission traces such sublimated molecules .",
    "the absence of methanol maser emission toward the hot core implies that all of the observed ch@xmath0oh transitions are thermalized due to its high - density and high - temperature , as suggested by cyganowski et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in the hot core g19.01 - 0.03 .    toward m5 ,",
    "there are no detected 1.3 mm or infrared continuum sources .",
    "thus , the ch@xmath0oh molecule in m5 can not originate from radiative heating by embedded protostars .",
    "since m5 is located on the edge of the cs contours ( see figure 1 ) , the ch@xmath0oh molecule in m5 seems to be released to the gas phase by shocks , as mentioned above .",
    "one possibility is that the shock toward m5 is relatively old , and that sio has already been depleted onto dust grains .",
    "since the sublimation temperature of sio is much higher than that of ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath1790 k ) , sio can deplete onto dust grains even in a hot ( @xmath22@xmath1790 k ) region . as a result ,",
    "gas - phase sio could decrease faster than gas - phase ch@xmath0oh in a post shocked region , unless the cooling timescale of post shocked materials is much shorter than the depletion timescale of gaseous molecules .",
    "the depletion timescale of molecules depends on the gas density : @xmath1710@xmath26/(n [ @xmath27 ) [ yr ] ( tielens , 2005 ) .",
    "since the critical densities of the observed thermal ch@xmath0oh lines are 10@xmath28 @xmath29 , the depletion timescale of ch@xmath0oh could be 10@xmath30 yr in the emitting region .",
    "if the shock ended and the gas was cooled down below the sublimation temperature of ch@xmath0oh about 10@xmath30 years ago , ch@xmath0oh would still be in the gas phase to some extent toward m5 .",
    "cyganowski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also pointed out a similar possibility from the observations of class i methanol masers and sio toward massive ysos in g18.67 + 0.03 .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the maser emission can be maintained for a relatively long timescale after the shock ended .",
    "model calculations may be necessary to assess this possibility .",
    "another possibility is that the methanol maser emission toward m5 traces relatively weak shocks .",
    "caselli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that mantle evaporation occurs when the shock velocities are larger than 6 km s@xmath18 , and grain - core destruction occurs when the shock velocities are larger than 19 km s@xmath18 .",
    "thus , the ch@xmath0oh / sio abundance ratio depends on the strength of the shock , and may be high in a weak shock .",
    "the high ch@xmath0oh / sio intensity ratio toward m5 may suggest that a weak shock occurs there , although we can not find a clear velocity structure indicating an outflow near m5 .    in either case , the driving source of the outflow is not clear . according to the morphology of the cs emission",
    ", the spitzer sources might be the driving source . if we can investigate proper motions of the maser spots by using vlbi ( e.g. matsumoto et al . 2014 ) and in the future obtain alma observations with longer baselines , we may find the driving source",
    ". such high resolution observations of methanol masers will be powerful tools to reveal a possible relationship between dynamical and chemical evolution of cluster - forming regions .",
