    "understanding the physical properties of low - dimensional thermal transport is an active field of research since such properties are often counter intuitive and present intriguing features @xcite .",
    "for instance , some one - dimensional ( 1d ) models violate the well known fourier law of heat transport , while some others do not .    it has been known , since the seminal work of rieder _ et al . _",
    "[ ] , that in 1d homogeneous harmonic systems ( also referred to as integrable systems ) , the thermal conductivity diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "no temperature gradient is formed in the bulk of the system , since the dominating energy `` carriers '' are not scattered and propagate ballistically . a large variety of harmonic ( integrable ) classical @xcite and quantum @xcite systems",
    "have been studied using analytical and/or numerical approaches .",
    "all these studies show that there is no temperature gradient inside the system ( except for small regions in the vicinity of the contacts between the central system and the baths ) .",
    "one usually obtains a constant - temperature profile @xcite in the central system around the averaged temperature @xmath0 .    on the other hand , in classical or quantum non - integrable systems",
    ", a temperature gradient is formed inside the system .",
    "the temperature gradient is uniform , and the heat conductivity is finite .",
    "the transport is said to be diffusive and these systems obey fourier s law . in order to obtain a diffusive transport regime",
    ", one has to introduce any form of anharmonic effects in the system @xcite .",
    "diffusive transport is also obtained when extra local stochastic processes @xcite or extra collision processes @xcite are introduced .",
    "a vibrational mode coupling in classical systems @xcite is also responsible for diffusive transport .",
    "the introduction of configurational defects @xcite or disorder @xcite in harmonic systems can also lead to diffusive transport , with the build up of a temperature gradient across the system .",
    "defects and disorder introduce some form of localisation of the vibration modes @xcite which do not favour ballistic transport @xcite .    in the previously mentioned studies , the system is either ballistic or diffusive .",
    "however it is very important to understand if a crossover between the two regimes can be obtained as it has been observed experimentally in a wide range of low - dimensional systems ( from carbon nanotubes @xcite , graphene nanoribbons @xcite , nanowires @xcite and polymer nanofibres @xcite ) . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "the ballistic to diffusive crossover has been studied phenomenologically by introducing and tuning a viscosity - like coefficient ( in a simple langevin - like dynamics ) on each atom in the system @xcite , by modifying the inter - atomic potential @xcite , or by introducing a simple description of phonon - phonon interaction @xcite . a single scheme that can describe both regimes is central and crucially needed to understand the origin of the crossover .",
    "recently , a unified microscopy formalism to study the ballistic - to - diffusive crossover was provided in @xcite on the basis of a scaling ansatz for model systems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use a single scheme , based on the generalised langevin equation ( gle ) , for simulating the dissipative dynamics of realistic al systems ; and we shall also determine if different transport regimes can be obtained and why .",
    "we consider 1d atomic chains connected to two thermal 3d baths kept at temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we use the embedded atom method ( eam ) @xcite to describe the inter - atomic potential between the atoms in these systems .",
    "the only `` free parameters '' that can be changed are the length @xmath3 of the 1d chains and the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the baths .",
    "we study the temperature and length dependence of the linear heat conductance and of the nonequilibrium heat current .",
    "we find different transport regimes , i.e. diffusive or ballistic , depending on the temperatures and temperature differences and on the length of the chains .",
    "we analyse the results in terms of anharmonic versus harmonic effects in the effective inter - atomic potential .",
    "to study the thermal transport of 1d atomic chains , we used our recently developed gle scheme @xcite . the method and its implementation in the molecular dynamics package lammps @xcite",
    "have been well documented in recent papers @xcite .",
    "the extension of the original gle scheme to situations where the central system is interacting with several independent baths has been recently given in @xcite .",
    "we call it the gle-2b scheme .",
    "we stress that this method , at least in principle , enables one to obtain an exact solution of the problem of heat transport in the classical case .",
    "the method is based on a physically realistic picture of infinite leads kept at equilibrium ( at corresponding temperatures ) and an arbitrary central region which interacts and exchanges heat with the leads .",
    "the only approximations made are that the leads are treated as harmonic baths and the interaction between the leads and the central system is linear in terms of displacements of the atoms in the leads ; the central system is treated without any approximations and can be arbitrarily anharmonic .     in a recent paper  [ ] ,",
    "we have discussed the advantage of the gle-2b approach over other more conventional thermostatting approaches such as nose - hoover or simple langevin thermostats . here , we use our gle-2b approach as it does not rely on the use of adjustable parameter(s ) to describe the relaxation processes in the baths . in ref .",
    "[ ] , we have shown that depending upon the value used for such parameters , one observe completely different physical results .",
    "this is a situation we want to avoid in the present study as we want to study the influence of , only , the length of the system and the baths temperatures , on the thermal transport properties .",
    "we now briefly recall the main `` ingredients '' of the method .",
    "we consider a central system ( the 1d atomic chain ) with a general hamiltonian dynamics for the positions @xmath4 and momenta @xmath5 degrees of freedom ( dof ) associated with atom @xmath6 ( mass @xmath7 ) and cartesian coordinate @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath17 is the mass of atom @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling force @xmath18 between the central system and the bath @xmath16 is arbitrary with respect to the central system dof @xmath4 .    by solving newton s equations of motion for all the dofs , and integrating out the baths dofs ,",
    "one obtains the following `` embedded '' dissipative dynamics for the dof of the central system @xcite : @xmath19    the total force @xmath20 acting on atom @xmath6 of the central system ( in direction @xmath21 ) arises not only from the interaction between atoms in the central system , but also from the interaction between these atoms and the atoms of the harmonic baths which are kept fixed at their equilibrium positions .",
    "the force @xmath20 also contains a polaronic - like term which reflects the fact that , due to the coupling between the central system and the baths , the harmonic oscillators of the baths are displaced @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : gle ] ) also contains a generalised memory kernel which depends on both times @xmath22 and @xmath23 separately ( i.e. not on their difference ) and also on the spatial coordinates ( dofs ) @xmath24 of all atoms of the central system .",
    "the memory kernel is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the derivative of the coupling force @xmath27 and the polarization matrix @xmath28 is related to the harmonic dynamical matrix of the bath @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "finally , the terms @xmath29 contain all the information about the initial conditions of the bath @xmath16 dofs .    by considering these initial conditions as random processes ,",
    "the corresponding stochastic forces @xmath29 can be described by a multi - dimensional gaussian stochastic process with correlation functions @xcite @xmath30 and consequently eq.([eq : gle ] ) corresponds now to a generalised langevin equation for the central system dofs , with a non - markovian memory kernel and coloured noise .    ,",

    "one can easily see that for small temperature differences @xmath69 , the heat current is almost independent of the chain length which is characteristic of the ballistic transport regime . for larger temperature differences @xmath70 or @xmath2 , the current @xmath44 decreases with the chain length .",
    "the larger the temperature differences are , the more @xmath44 decreases with the chain length which is characteristic of a diffusive system .    as we mentioned in the introduction , the diffusive transport regime",

    "the dependence of @xmath79 and @xmath80 vs @xmath3 , and the presence of a temperature gradient across the chain , indicate a more diffusive transport regime which could be a signature either of anharmonicity in the systems or of the existence of localised vibration modes .",
    "note that for small temperatures and small temperature differences , the chains behave as ballistic harmonic systems .",
    "it is important now to understand what kind of physics is behind the two transport regimes . for that we check first how the eigenmodes of vibration of the 1d chains change when @xmath3 increases .",
    "the eigenmodes of vibration of the chains are obtained from the diagonalisation of the dynamical matrix of the chains connected to the baths , as shown on figure  [ fig:1dchains ] .",

    "one observes more ( nearly ) degenerate modes in the longer chains and a larger number of long wavelength modes in the longer chains , as expected .",
    "furthermore , we do not see any eigenvalues outside the energy spectrum that would correspond to localised modes ( i.e. bound states ) .",
    "the presence of such more localised mode ( in the longer chains ) would lead to the breakdown of the ballistic properties .",
    "( bottom to top lines with circle ) .",
    "more ( nearly ) degenerate modes exist in the longer chains .",
    "however the `` accumulation '' of a lot of long wave - length modes ( around @xmath81 ) is not yet achieved for @xmath75 .",
    "there are no obvious boundstates outside the energy spectrum that would corresponding to more localised vibrational modes.,width=283 ]    another possible mechanism is related to anharmonic effects in the inter - atomic potential . in order to understand such effects ,",
    "we first consider the work of segal _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in that work , a simpler bath model and coupling to the bath was used in comparison with our gle-2b .",
    "however , in their model calculations , the authors modified the inter - atomic potential used for their description of the interaction in the 1d chains .",
    "it was found that for purely harmonic chains , the heat current is roughly independent of the chain length ( a harmonic chain is an integrable model and presents ballistic properties no matter what the chain length is ) .",
    "when anharmonic effects are introduced in the inter - atomic potential , @xmath44 becomes length dependent and decreases with increasing chain length ( see fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "such results are fully compatible with our calculations of @xmath80 shown in figure  [ fig : jlin_vsl ] .     versus time .",
    "the average variance @xmath82 increases when the temperature increases ( see the two top panels ) .",
    "however such an increase is bigger when one increases the length of the chains .",
    "hence in short chains , the atoms are more confined around the bottom of the potential energy well , while for longer chains , the atoms have more `` space '' to move and are able to sample the anharmonic part of the potential well.,width=321 ]    in order to quantify the presence of anharmonic effect , we consider the averaged displacement @xmath82",
    ". the averaged displacement @xmath83 is obtained from @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath85 is the relative displacement of atom @xmath6 in the chain of length @xmath3 .",

    "figure  [ fig : sqrdispl ] shows the evolution of @xmath82 versus time when the system has reached the steady state .",
    "the results show that , for a given chain length , the average variance @xmath82 increases when the temperature increases , as expected ( top panels in fig .",

    "however , for a given couple of temperatures @xmath91 , the average variance is more pronounced in longer chains than in the shorter ones ( see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqrdispl ] ) .",
    "this suggests that for short chains , the atoms are more confined around the bottom of the the potential energy well , while for longer chains , the atoms have more `` room '' to move and are able to sample the anharmonic part of the potential energy well .    fig .",
    "[ fig:1config_27at ] shows typical configurations of the atoms in the long chain with @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , during the gle run , some atoms get closer to each other ( with distances smaller than the average inter - atomic distance ) , forming some of kind of clusters .",
    "the distance between `` clusters '' is also larger than the average inter - atomic distance .",
    "such a feature is also characteristic of the presence of long wavelength modes , which are more numerous in longer chains than in the shorter ones .",
