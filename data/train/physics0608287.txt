    "let us represent the 2d flow with velocity vector field @xmath0 as a complex scalar function @xmath1 by means of the usual isomorphism @xmath2 regarding the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane as the complex @xmath5 plane , we note that the divergence and curl of @xmath1 are given by @xmath6 here the first equation expresses incompressibility of the flow @xmath1 , and the second defines the vorticity @xmath7 , understood as the ( scalar ) component of a vector field normal to the plane .",
    "similarly , the gradient of the pressure @xmath8 in this complex representation is @xmath9 the stokes equation , representing the balance of viscous stress in the fluid by the pressure gradient , then becomes @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the viscosity . in light of eqs .",
    "( [ divu ] ) and ( [ curlu ] ) this means that @xmath12 that is , that @xmath13 is a single - valued function of @xmath5 , holomorphic except for possible poles @xcite .",
    "if we choose such a function @xmath14 , we can integrate eqs .",
    "( [ divu ] ) and ( [ curlu ] ) to find the flow @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a second holomorphic function , having logarithmic singularities at the poles of @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath1 is represented in terms of two holomorphic functions , @xmath14 and @xmath17 .    the force exerted by the flow @xmath1 on a finite obstacle , given by closed contour @xmath18 , just involves the enclosed residues of @xmath14 .",

    "( [ functionf ] ) and ( [ uformula ] ) , and integrating over the closed curve @xmath18 , oriented in the conventional positive direction , we find the force on @xmath18 due to the fluid outside it @xmath21\\\\ & = & \\frac{i\\mu}{2}\\left[\\oint_cd(z\\overline{f}+\\overline{g})+\\oint_c f\\,dz\\right]\\\\ \\label{fonobstacle } & = & i\\mu\\oint_c f\\,dz=-2\\pi\\mu\\sum_c { \\rm res}(f)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last line follows because @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ uformula ] ) is single - valued .",
    "consider the integer lattice generated by two complex numbers , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , consisting of the points @xmath25 for all integers @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "suppose identical obstacles are located at these places , forming a doubly periodic array . a stokes flow through this array , represented as in eq .",
    "( [ uformula ] ) , is characterized by a function @xmath14 with very restrictive properties .",
    "it is single - valued , it is holomorphic outside the obstacles , it has poles inside the obstacles , its imaginary part is doubly periodic , and its real part is a doubly periodic function plus a linear function , where the linear function is essentially the average pressure @xmath28 , increasing linearly along its ( constant ) gradient . if we further ask for the simplest function of this type , having only simple poles at the @xmath29 , then there is essentially only one possibility , the weierstrass zeta function @xmath30 , with a linear correction .",
    "this follows from the theory of elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "( note that @xmath31 depends also on the lattice constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but we regard these as fixed parameters and do not indicate this dependence . )",
    "more precisely we make use of the quasi - periodicity of @xmath30 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are constants satisfying @xmath35 then we can take , for the function @xmath14 , either of @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 . using eqs .",
    "( [ quasiperiodic ] ) and ( [ eta1eta3 ] ) , we verify that @xmath37 thus in both functions only the real part , which we interpret as @xmath38 , shows a linear growth .",
    "the average pressure gradient corresponding to @xmath39 is perpendicular to @xmath40 . from its projection on the other lattice vector",
    "we determine that it is @xmath41 by taking linear combinations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 we can find a suitable @xmath14 with the pressure gradient in any direction with respect to the lattice .",
    "the combination corresponding to a pressure gradient of the same magnitude as @xmath42 and @xmath43 but in the direction @xmath44 is @xmath45 with @xmath46    the force on the fluid in a period parallelogram @xmath47 , with sides @xmath48 and @xmath49 , due to the average pressure in the flow corresponding to @xmath39 , is @xmath50    the force on the fluid due to each obstacle in this same flow , since @xmath30 is normalized to have residue 1 at each simple pole , is @xmath51 , by eq .",
    "( [ fonobstacle ] ) .",
    "there is on average one obstacle in each period parallelogram .",
    "thus the force on the fluid due to the average pressure ( applied somehow from outside ) is balanced by the force due to the obstacles , and the net force on the fluid is zero , as is always the case in stokes flows .    a more general function @xmath14 in the representation of eq .",
    "( [ uformula ] ) for the stokes flow @xmath1 would be a superposition of translates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , always keeping the singularities inside the obstacles , and not in the physical region of flow .",
    "equivalently , one could take a multipole expansion of such functions .",
    "this would be a series in derivatives of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these functions are doubly periodic with higher order poles at the lattice points , that is , they are the weierstrass @xmath52 function and its derivatives . thus @xmath14 has the form @xmath53 if the boundary contours have reflection symmetry in the origin , then it is enough to take only the terms in the series with @xmath27 odd .",
    "from eq .  ( [ uformula ] ) we know that the flow @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath14 above is @xmath54 where @xmath17 is a second analytic function , still to be determined .",
    "we have already used the freedom to add terms of the form @xmath55 in adding a term @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the sigma function , another of the special functions of elliptic function theory @xcite .",
    "such logarithmic terms compensate the multivaluedness of logarithmic terms in the integral of @xmath14 .",
    "now among all the functions @xmath17 that we could choose , we want the one that makes @xmath1 doubly periodic , and that makes @xmath58 ( say ) on the boundary contours of the obstacles . since the logarithmic part of @xmath17 has been explicitly written as a separate term , @xmath17 as defined above is single - valued , and hence has a laurent series in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "we must anticipate , though , that @xmath17 has singularities at all the lattice points @xmath29 , and hence that this series would converge only out to the nearest such lattice point .",
    "this difficulty can be removed because double periodicity of @xmath1 determines the principal part of @xmath17 at all lattice points .",
    "we see , for example , that @xmath1 blows up logarithmically at @xmath59 but , because of the poles in @xmath31 , it blows up like @xmath60 at every other lattice point .",
    "this is inconsistent with double periodicity , and hence @xmath17 must cancel the @xmath60 behavior at all @xmath29 except @xmath61 . also , in the laurent series for @xmath17 about @xmath59 , there will be negative powers of @xmath5 .",
    "translates of these terms contribute to the principal part of @xmath17 at other @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a set of indices @xmath63 sufficiently large to label all @xmath29 in a disk large enough to contain a period parallelogram .",
    "then we take @xmath17 in the form @xmath64 because the poles of @xmath17 have been included as explicit terms , the power series with coefficients @xmath65 now converges out to the nearest @xmath29 not indexed in @xmath62 , and we choose this index set large enough to get good numerical behavior in our final step .",
    "lastly we specify the boundary conditions that determine the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in eqs .",
    "( [ uperiodic ] ) and ( [ gperiodic ] ) .",
    "we choose a region @xmath47 with a boundary @xmath69 that is entirely within the fluid region , and such that every point @xmath5 in @xmath69 has a corresponding point @xmath70 in @xmath69 displaced by one of the lattice constants @xmath71 .",
    "typically @xmath47 would be the period parallelogram centered on the origin with vertices @xmath72 .",
    "we ask that the complex function @xmath1 be periodic , taking the same value at points @xmath5 and @xmath70 in @xmath69 related by a lattice constant , and also that the derivative @xmath73 be periodic in the same sense .",
    "we also require that @xmath1 take prescribed values on the boundary contour @xmath18 of the obstacle . choosing a large number of pairs of points @xmath74 on @xmath69 and",
    "also points @xmath5 on @xmath18 for imposing these conditions , we obtain an overdetermined inhomogeneous system of linear equations that we then solve in the sense of least squares .",
    "because @xmath68 occurs together with its complex conjugate @xmath75 , the system must be regarded as real linear , not complex linear . with suitable choices for the truncation parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ,",
    "this boundary value problem has a solution accurate to many decimal places .",
    "we confirm the solutions in @xcite , for flows through square and triangular lattices of obstacles , to 5 decimal places , typically .",
    "it is superficially surprising that one can stipulate conditions on both @xmath1 and its derivative in this elliptic problem , but it is clear physically that such periodic solutions must exist .",
    "it is also clear mathematically , if one considers the equivalent stokes flow on a torus .",
    "this argument only applies , though , if the applied stress that drives the flow has all the properties that we have required of the function @xmath14 in section  [ pressure ] . for other functions @xmath14 the boundary value problem would have no solution . knowing the form of @xmath14 in advance , as we do , the actual boundary values of @xmath8 and @xmath1 emerge as part of the solution .",
    "other approaches to this problem are typically restricted to situations in which one knows the boundary values by symmetry , where @xmath8 is constant on part of @xmath69 , for example , or where @xmath1 is normal or tangential on @xmath69 , special cases that do not hold for general lattices and flows .",
    "let us define the _",
    "mean _ of a flow @xmath1 to be the constant flow @xmath79 such that the flux of @xmath79 and the flux of @xmath1 into a period parallelogram are the same .",
    "by incompressibility of the flow , this is also the flux of @xmath79 ( and @xmath1 ) out of a period parallelogram .",
    "if we take the period parallelogram to be the one with vertices @xmath72 , then we have the formula @xmath80\\ ] ] the integrals depend only on the endpoints , by incompressibility of the flow , and the formula is invariant under a common translation of the endpoints .",
    "thus the choice of period parallelogram is in fact arbitrary .    using this formulation",
    "we have computed the tensorial relation between the force @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ fonobstacle ] ) and the mean velocity @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ meanv ] ) in many examples . for regular square and triangular lattices , @xmath81 and @xmath79",
    "are simply proportional , but more generally @xmath82 where the conductance tensor @xmath83 is a real symmetric matrix ( and we are now representing @xmath79 and @xmath81 as real 2-vectors , not complex scalars ) .",
    "a typical computed flow is shown in figure  [ flow2 ] .    ,",
    "@xmath84 , and the obstacles have radius @xmath85 .",
    "the pressure gradient is vertical , but the mean flow is , to good approximation , along @xmath23 , the shorter of the lattice vectors . ]    here @xmath86 , @xmath84 , and the circular obstacles have radius @xmath85 .",
    "the pressure gradient @xmath81 is in the @xmath4 direction , but the mean flow @xmath79 is approximately along @xmath23 , the shorter of the lattice vectors .",
    "the reason for this behavior is simple , and in accord with common sense .",
    "the direction of @xmath23 is an  easy direction \" for the flow , an eigenvector of @xmath83 , and the corresponding conductance eigenvalue for the rather wide  channels \" along this direction is large .",
    "the obstacles , being relatively closely spaced along the direction of @xmath23 , create  walls \" along the sides of the channels .",
    "the conductance corresponding to the other , perpendicular eigenvector , normal to the  walls \" , is much smaller than the conductance along the channels .",
    "the ratio of the two eigenvalues , a measure of the anisotropy of the conductance tensor , is about @xmath87 in this example , noticeably more anisotropic than the lattice itself .",
    "it is clear that the conductance anisotropy could be indefinitely large for this lattice if the round obstacles were larger and almost touched along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the theory described here provides a starting point for problems involving flow near ciliated surfaces . within a ciliated layer",
    ", the cilia , hairlike projections from the surface , would constitute the regular array of obstacles . in the simplest case they would be rigid and perpendicular to the surface .",
    "consider , for example , a straight pipe of circular cross section , with such a ciliated inner surface , still leaving a free cylindrical channel down the center .",
    "suppose the length of the cilia is much greater than the mean distance between them , and much less than the radius of the pipe .",
    "the poiseuille flow problem asks for the flow in response to a pressure difference between one end of the pipe and the other .",
    "the usual boundary condition says that the flow should be zero on the walls of the pipe , and this condition still determines the flow in a thin region near the wall , comparable in thickness to the mean spacing of the cilia , but within most of the ciliated layer , the mean flow will be given in the manner described here . via a similarly thin transition layer ,",
    "the poiseuille flow down the unobstructed central channel matches this mean flow at its edge .",
    "systematic anisotropy in the placement of the cilia , including , one must anticipate , a merely statistical anisotropy , would impart rotation to the fluid channel , as it amounts to a  rifling \" of the inner surface of the pipe .",
    "considerations of this kind are relevant in biological settings where such surfaces are very common .",
    "the cilia as we have just described them are merely passive obstacles , but often they are active agents driving flows .",
    "the methods of this paper could also be a starting point for treating such phenomena , as we hope to show in the future .",
