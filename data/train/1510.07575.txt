    "one of the roads in search for novel materials is based on heterostructures formed at least from two different materials .",
    "such systems can have properties which are significantly different from those of individual materials .",
    "recently , there has been growing interest in the heterostructures based on oxides , like laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 for instance .",
    "this is because interfaces between two oxides may have unusual properties.@xcite it has been shown , that even though the constituent oxides are ordinary band insulators with well - known electronic properties,@xcite their interfaces can exhibit a variety of phenomena  from two - dimensional ( 2d ) metallic conductivity,@xcite and superconductivity,@xcite to ferromagnetism  @xcite and coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity.@xcite    beginning with the paper by ohtomo and hwang,@xcite the physical properties of the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface have been intensively studied in recent years , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the main peculiarity of such an interface is its perfectly metallic conductivity , with a relatively high electronic mobility , that can be described by the model of 2d electron gas .",
    "moreover , all the above mentioned unusual properties , like interfacial magnetism and superconductivity occur in this case as well.@xcite apart from this , anomalous magnetoresistance and hall effect have been measured in this system , too.@xcite the emergence of conductive interface is closely related to the metal - insulator transition , which can be realized at this interface.@xcite    several physical models have been proposed in order to account for possible origin of the interface metallicity in the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 system . to our knowledge",
    ", one can distinguish three groups of such models .",
    "the first group is related to the so - called polar catastrophe model.@xcite the second group is based on extrinsic doping by cations such as la@xmath9 , which is n - type dopant in srtio@xmath0 ( sto).@xcite the third model , in turn , consists in the formation of bulk - like oxygen vacancies in the sto layers near the interface , which provide free charge carriers.@xcite    the _ polar catastrophe _ model is based on the argument that the alternating polarity of atomic layers in laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) along the [ 001 ] direction leads to a diverging electrostatic potential across the structure ( hence the words _ polar catastrophe _ ) , unless the electric charges are reconstructed at the interface .",
    "two possible choices for the connection of lao and sto impose opposite electrostatic boundary conditions .",
    "namely , laalo@xmath0 is composed of charged layers of ( lao)@xmath10 and ( alo@xmath11)@xmath12 , whereas the corresponding layers in srtio@xmath0 are electrically neutral .",
    "therefore , terminating the lao on an atomic plane at the interface breaks the charge neutrality , yielding the above mentioned _ polar catastrophe _ at the interface . to avoid this diverging interface energy , a compensating charge is required .",
    "this demonstrates that the _ polar catastrophe _ model is based on the notion of crystal atomic planes which interact with each other along the [ 001 ] direction . below we will use this fact when formulating the tight - binding model .    it should be emphasized that there is still active debate on the possible physical mechanisms of the formation of two - dimensional electron gas,@xcite the electron energy structure , and the electron states at the lao / sto interface . here",
    "we present a simplified model , in which the formation of the 2d electron states at the interface is related to a short - range potential barrier ( or potential well ) near the interface .",
    "this potential barrier may be related to a mechanical stress , which is inevitably present at any interface due to mismatch and misfit effects or various kinds of imperfections . in principle , the existence of such barrier at the interface is in agreement with the _ polar catastrophe _ model , which requires the reconstruction of the crystalline structure at the heterointerface in order to avoid the electrostatic potential divergence . in section 2",
    "we describe the tight - binding model of the electronic structure of lao and also of sto .",
    "section 3 presents description of the electronic states at the interface of sto and lao . summary and final conclusions",
    "are in section 4 .",
    "having in mind the main objective of this paper , which is to describe electronic properties of the lao / sto interface , we begin with the model hamiltonian of a layered crystal like lao and sto .",
    "to do this we use the approach based on the tight - binding model , with electron hopping within each atomic layer ( lying in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , see fig .  1 ) and interlayer electron hopping along the axis @xmath3 ( perpendicular to the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ) .",
    "the latter hopping term is assumed to be relatively small and therefore will be considered perturbatively",
    ".     corresponds to the interface , while @xmath13 is the lattice constant . ]    in the case of laalo@xmath0 , the intralayer hoping occurs within the la - o and al - o atomic layers , which are parallel to the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , while the interlayer hopping occurs between al and o atoms in the neighboring atomic planes , see fig .  1 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian in the basis of atomic orbitals can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 labels crystal unit cells and @xmath16 refers to the nonequivalent atoms within the cell . in the following we use the atom s labeling as shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the hopping parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the intra - planar ones , while @xmath19 is the hoping parameter between the layers , i.e. that along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "it is firmly established , that possible metallic conductivity of the lao / sto interface  @xcite occurs in a narrow 2d interface region . bearing this in mind ,",
    "our approach to the interface states is to trace how the coupling of 2d atomic layers ( due to interlayer hopping , @xmath20 ) alters their electronic spectrum . to do this",
    "we assume the interlayer hoping term ( @xmath19 ) as a small perturbation in comparison to the intralayer hopping ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we use the fourier transformation @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 describing position of the elementary cell , and @xmath25 describing position of the @xmath16-th atom within the cell . here ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the basis vectors of the lattice and @xmath28 is a three - dimensional ( 3d ) wavevector .",
    "the fourier - transformed hamiltonian becomes @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we took into account the fact that only the term @xmath59 is nonzero .",
    "thus , to describe electrons in the considered electronic bands , we can restrict ourselves to an effective 3d model which includes electron hopping between the 2d electron bands . in the matrix form",

    "in summary , the tight - binding model we applied to a junction with a potential barrier at the interface is a natural continuation of a microscopic description of layered oxide structures , stemming from the paper by ohtomo and hwang,@xcite see fig.1 of this paper .",
    "the natural way to model the mechanical stresses and crystalline structure imperfections , which is inevitably present at the interface , is to introduce the interfacial potential , which can modify the electronic structure of the lao / sto heterojunction .",
    "we have shown that , depending on the potential strength @xmath4 , the interfacial conductivity can change its character from @xmath218 ( quasielectron ) to @xmath219type ( quasihole ) with some threshold value @xmath220 , at which the charge carrier becomes dispersionless and thus can not propagate .",
    "this means that at some interfacial potential strength , @xmath221 , this potential ( related to mechanical stress and/or imperfections ) works as a _ valve _ , which suppresses the interfacial conductivity and also separates the regions of @xmath218type ( @xmath222 ) and @xmath219type ( @xmath223 ) conductivity .",
    "in other words , the variation of the interfacial potential can modulate the conductivity , which may be used in the designing of functional interfaces for oxide electronic devices .",

    "<S> we present a tight binding description of electronic properties of the interface between laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) . </S>",
    "<S> the description assumes lao and sto perovskites as sets of atomic layers in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , which are weakly coupled by an interlayer hopping term along the @xmath3 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the interface is described by an additional potential , @xmath4 , which simulates a planar defect . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the interfacial potential can result from either a mechanical stress at the interface or other structural imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> we show that depending on the potential strength , charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) may form an energy band which is localized at the interface and is within the band gaps of the constituting materials ( lao and sto ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our description predicts a _ valve effect _ at a certain critical potential strength , @xmath5 , when the interface potential works as a valve suppressing the interfacial conductivity . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the interfacial electrons become dispersionless at @xmath6 , and thus can not propagate . </S>",
    "<S> this critical value separates the _ quasielectron _ ( @xmath7 @xmath5 ) and _ quasihole _ </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath8 @xmath5 ) regimes of the interfacial conductivity . </S>"
