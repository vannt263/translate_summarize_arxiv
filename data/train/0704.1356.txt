    "the publications of kia ngai deal with more substances and more measurement techniques than the work of any other scientist in the field of undercooled liquids . within the past three decades ,",
    "whenever a new development appeared , he was the quickest to appreciate it , analyze it and bring it to the general attention , thus speeding up the progress substantially .    many scientists in the field share his conviction that the flow process in highly viscous liquids can only be understood by combining all possible techniques for its study @xcite .",
    "the present paper evaluates recently published @xcite broadband shear and dielectric relaxation data on seven glass formers .",
    "the mechanical shear data were obtained with a new technique @xcite which allows to cover a large dynamical range .",
    "samples for dielectric and shear measurements were taken from the same charge , and the temperature sensors of both measurements were calibrated to each other .",
    "the data show a striking similarity of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the right hand side of the @xmath0-peak , a similarity which is sometimes perturbed by the secondary johari - goldstein peak @xcite .",
    "the similarity suggests a common origin of the @xmath0-peak in dielectrics and shear .",
    "the fact that the shear peak appears at a higher frequency than the dielectric peak is explainable in terms of the viscosity , which in a compliance treatment @xcite is a free parameter .    in order to identify the elementary processes with thermally",
    "activated jumps over an energy barrier @xmath3 , one can use a recent translation @xcite of the textbook @xcite retardation spectrum @xmath4 into a barrier density function @xmath5 .",
    "we will argue that the compliance barrier density of the shear equals the electric dipole moment barrier density @xmath6 of the dielectric data .",
    "the next section ( section ii ) explains and motivates this approach in more detail . the results of the data treatment are described in section iii .",
    "they are discussed and compared to other approaches in section iv .",
    "section v summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "the choice of a retardation spectrum for the shear is motivated by a surprising coincidence , which is more or less visible in the data of all seven substances .",
    "we show the two examples where it is most clearly seen in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 .    fig . 1 compares @xmath1 and @xmath7 at the same temperature for the type - a glass former ppe .",
    "ppe , 1,3-bis(3-phenoxyphenoxy)benzene , is a diffusion pump oil with the commercial name santovac-5p , a molecule consisting of five phenyl rings connected by four oxygens to form a short chain . in terms of the classification proposed by the bayreuth group @xcite",
    ", it is a type - a glass former , a glass former which shows no or at least no pronounced secondary johari - goldstein peak .",
    "the ( negative ) @xmath2-data have been scaled to coincide with the @xmath1-data on the right hand side of the peak .",
    "one finds good agreement between @xmath1 and @xmath7 as soon as the frequency is two decades higher than the one of the peak in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "1 shows a change of slope of the @xmath0-tail , from an @xmath8- to an @xmath9-behavior .",
    "the tendency is seen most clearly in the dielectric data , but it is also in the shear data ; their fit improves markedly if one allows for a @xmath9-component .",
    "this might be the influence of a hidden johari - goldstein peak , an explanation which has been favored for glycerol on the basis of pressure , aging and chemical series measurements ( for a review , see ngai and paluch @xcite ) .",
    "but there is also impressive experimental evidence for a limiting @xmath9-behavior in shear compliance data of type - a molecular glass formers @xcite , which show the so - called andrade @xcite creep , @xmath10 , in the short - time limit .",
    "therefore we will fit our data in terms of a sum of an @xmath11-term ( with @xmath12 as fit parameter ) and an @xmath9-term , dominating at high frequency .    toward lower frequency ,",
    "the common slope terminates for the shear data already at a higher frequency ( a shorter time ) than for the dielectric data .",
    "the natural explanation for this is that the parallel between dielectrics and shear is in fact between shear compliance and dielectric susceptibility . in a comparison of these two quantities ,",
    "the shear compliance starts to deviate from the dielectric susceptibility as soon as the viscous flow sets in .",
    "this suggests a treatment of the shear data in terms of a retardation spectrum , with the viscosity as an independent parameter @xcite .    the good agreement at the right - hand side of the @xmath0-peak is found to be a general feature of all seven measured substances , as long as there is no disturbing influence from the secondary johari - goldstein peak @xcite .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "2 , which shows that the good agreement between @xmath13 and @xmath14 disappears as the peaks merge .",
    "the substance , tripropylene glycol ( tpg ) , @xmath15 , is still a molecule and not yet a polymer ( the whole series from the small molecule propylene glycol to long - chain polypropylene glycol is well - investigated by dielectrics @xcite ) .",
    "tpg itself has been studied under aging @xcite and under pressure @xcite .",
    "it consists of three connected propylene groups , with a large dielectric moment and a pronounced johari - goldstein peak ( which is absent or at least much less pronounced in propylene glycol @xcite ) .",
    "2 shows another tendency which will be evaluated quantitatively in this paper , namely a much stronger increase of the imaginary quantities in the @xmath0-peak region with temperature than in the johari - goldstein peak region .",
    "if one wants to decompose a measured relaxation into a spectrum of exponential decays in time , one can choose between two equivalent possibilities @xcite , the relaxation spectrum in which the elementary exponential relaxators add to decrease the modulus or the retardation spectrum in which they add to increase a susceptibility . in principle , the choice is not crucial , because the two spectra can be calculated from each other . here",
    ", we choose the retardation spectrum , with the viscosity @xmath16 as an independent variable .    for this choice",
    ", one has the textbook expressions @xcite for the real and imaginary parts of the complex frequency - dependent shear compliance @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relaxation time and @xmath4 is the weight of this relaxation time in the retardation spectrum .",
    "@xmath20 , the glass compliance , is the inverse of the infinite frequency modulus @xmath21 .    in an energy landscape picture @xcite ,",
    "one reckons with thermally activated jumps over the energy barrier between two neighboring minima .",
    "in fact , one very often finds a broad secondary relaxation peak ( the johari - goldstein peak @xcite ) below the @xmath0-peak of the flow process .",
    "this peak follows the arrhenius relation in the glass phase , indicating that it stems from local thermally activated jumps . for a jump over an energy barrier of height @xmath3 , the arrhenius relation for the relaxation time @xmath22 reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 s and @xmath25 is the temperature .    for a spectrum of thermally activated jumps",
    ", one defines @xcite the barrier density function @xmath26 @xmath27 the index @xmath28 stands for the shear . with this definition ,",
    "the complex shear compliance equations ( [ jpferry ] ) and ( [ jppferry ] ) transform into @xmath29 and @xmath30    the dielectric susceptibility can also be described @xcite in terms of a dielectric barrier density function @xmath6 @xmath31 and @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the static dielectric susceptibility , @xmath34 is the real part of @xmath35 in the ghz range ( larger than @xmath36 , the square of the refractive index , because of vibrational contributions @xcite ) .",
    "the above definitions of eqs .",
    "( [ jp]-[epp ] ) imply a normalization of both @xmath26 and @xmath6 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the recoverable compliance of the steady - state flow @xcite , and @xmath39    the dielectric @xmath0-peak occurs always at a lower frequency than the shear one and seems to coincide with the heat capacity and the structural relaxation peaks @xcite .",
    "below , we will adopt the view that the left side of the dielectric peak marks the disappearance and renewal of the relaxing entities .    in order to describe this decay",
    ", one needs to multiply the barrier density of the energy landscape with an appropriate cutoff function at a cutoff barrier @xmath40 . here",
    ", we will assume that the relaxing entities decay exponentially in time with the critical relaxation time @xmath41 . with the arrhenius relation @xmath42 ,",
    "this translates into a double - exponential cutoff @xmath43    equations ( [ jpp ] ) and ( [ epp ] ) show that a johari - goldstein peak in @xmath1 or @xmath2 at the peak frequency @xmath44 corresponds to a peak in @xmath5 at a peak barrier @xmath45 .",
    "we will see that the johari - goldstein peaks are reasonably well described by gaussians in @xmath5 .    to describe both the @xmath0-peak and the johari - goldstein - peak in terms of a barrier density , @xmath26 and @xmath6",
    "will be fitted by the form @xmath46 the first two terms describe the high - frequency tail of the @xmath0-process , the third term the johari - goldstein peak ( if there is one ; in three of our seven examples , it is not needed ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 determines the slope @xmath11 at the beginning of the @xmath0-tail in the double - log plot of fig . 1 .    instead of using the three prefactors @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 as fit parameters",
    ", it is better to use the corresponding weights @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the integral over the barriers , equs .",
    "( [ snorm ] ) and ( [ enorm ] ) .",
    "a type - a glass former without johari - goldstein peak with @xmath53 is characterized by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath12 and @xmath54 , at least as far as the form of its spectrum is concerned . @xmath12 and @xmath55 have the advantage to be reasonably temperature - independent .    with this prescription",
    ", one can fit the @xmath2 of a type - a glass former with two temperature - independent parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath55 , and two temperature - dependent parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath40 .",
    "their temperature dependence is a decrease with increasing temperature , which is well fitted by an appropriate power law @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the glass temperature .",
    "similarly , one describes the decrease of @xmath40 with the exponent @xmath59 and the one of @xmath21 with @xmath60 .    the strategy of our evaluation is to fit @xmath5 to the dielectric data , and then use the same spectral form to describe the shear .",
    "the fit of the shear data requires three additional temperature - dependent parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath38 and @xmath16 .",
    "again , it is worthwhile to look for combinations which might turn out to be temperature - independent .",
    "one of them is the ratio @xmath61 which appears in the normalization of the shear spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ snorm ] ) .",
    "a second interesting possibility is not to fit the viscosity @xmath16 , but the ratio @xmath62 where @xmath41 is the arrhenius relaxation time of the terminal barrier @xmath40 . as we will show in the discussion",
    ", one can argue that the ratio @xmath63 should be 2 for a renewal of the relaxing entities within the critical time @xmath41 .    in the case of a type - b glass",
    "former , fig .",
    "2 shows that one needs another dimensionless parameter , because the weight of the johari - goldstein peak is different in the two quantities . in fig .",
    "2 , the johari - goldstein peak is more prominent in the shear signal , but this varies from substance to substance .",
    "three of our seven substances , tpe , dc704 and ppe , happen to have no or at least only a rather weak johari - goldstein peak .",
    "let us begin with tpe .",
    "tpe stands for triphenylethylene , @xmath64 , a rather flexible molecule with three phenyl rings attached to a central @xmath65 double bond .",
    "3 ( a ) shows data and fit for @xmath2 in a double - log plot , fig .",
    "3 ( b ) the ones for @xmath66 . the dielectric data in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) are well fitted with only the first two terms of eq .",
    "( [ lvform ] ) , without any johari - goldstein peak . @xmath12 and @xmath55 turn out to be temperature - independent within experimental accuracy .",
    "one gets a good fit for the shear data in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) , taking over @xmath12 , @xmath55 and the cutoff barrier @xmath40 from the fit of the dielectric data at the given temperature and fitting @xmath21 , @xmath67 and @xmath63 . @xmath21 is temperature - dependent , but @xmath67 and @xmath63 are again temperature - independent within the experimental accuracy , thus justifying our choice of variables .",
    "the parameters and their temperature dependence are listed in table i.    the temperature exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the critical barrier @xmath40 and the infinite frequency shear modulus @xmath21 are the same within their error bars ( about 5 % for @xmath59 and about 10 % for @xmath60 ) .",
    "this shows the validity of the shoving model @xcite , according to which the energy barrier of the @xmath0-process should be proportional to the infinite frequency shear modulus @xmath21 .",
    "the shoving model postulates that the @xmath0-process happens when the local energy concentration exceeds the product @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a volume expansion .",
    "the same results , maybe even a bit clearer because of the stronger dielectric signals , are obtained for the two other type - a glass formers ppe and dc704 .",
    "again , the fit parameters are listed in table i. in particular , the @xmath9-contribution is much better seen , as illustrated in fig . 1 for ppe . in dc704 ,",
    "again a diffusion pump oil ( 1,3,3,5-tetramethyl-1,1,5,5-tetraphenyl - trisiloxane , a rather large molecule ) we have the additional advantage of a large temperature range of the measurement , from 209 to 239 k. as in tpe , we find temperature - independent parameters @xmath12 , @xmath55 , @xmath67 and @xmath63 .",
    "again , we find the shoving model @xcite confirmed in both glass formers . in dc704 ,",
    "one even sees the curvature of both curves ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which justifies our temperature exponent ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ tscal ] ) .",
    "table i comprises the fit parameters for these three type - a glass formers .",
    "note that our formalism allows to describe both shear and dielectric data over the whole temperature range with eleven temperature - independent parameters .",
    ".parameters of the three type - a glass formers .",
    "upper part @xmath35 , lower part @xmath66 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the preceding section presented a quantitative description of the @xmath0- and the @xmath12-process in dielectrics and shear for seven different glass formers , a description which is based on the concept of isolated and independent thermally activated jumps in the energy landscape .",
    "the description allows for a reasonable fit of the temperature dependence in terms of temperature - independent parameters .",
    "the number of parameters is not small ; one needs eleven or twelve parameters for a type - a glass former ( depending on whether @xmath67 is temperature - independent or not , see table i and ii ) and five additional parameters for the description of the @xmath12- or johari - goldstein peak ( see table ii ) .    nevertheless , the exercise is not completely meaningless .",
    "one does indeed get meaningful quantitative information , which is impossible to obtain otherwise .",
    "the first and rather important one is the probable equality of the retardation spectra of shear and dielectrics ( but with a different weight of the johari - goldstein peak ) , an information which one can guess from the raw data ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) , but which requires a full fit for its quantitative check .",
    "the second and equally important quantitative information concerns the dimensionless ratio @xmath63 between the terminal dielectric relaxation time @xmath41 and the product of the viscosity with the total retardation compliance , eq .",
    "( [ fjc ] ) .",
    "the seven fitted values lie between 2 and 2.7 ( average value 2.37 ) .",
    "this indicates a general relation between the dielectric terminal time and the viscosity .",
    "since the dielectric terminal time seems to coincide with the structural lifetime @xcite , it is probably also the lifetime of the double - well potentials which are responsible for the retardation spectrum .",
    "question : what do we expect for the ratio @xmath63 if this is indeed the case ? to answer this question , consider a constant applied shear stress .",
    "after the time @xmath41 , all the double - well potentials of the spectrum would have reached thermal equilibrium , giving their full contribution to the compliance . from this consideration , if we renew them at the time @xmath41 , we would naively expect them to be able to give their contribution again after this time , yielding @xmath70 .",
    "but this answer is not correct . to get the correct answer",
    ", one must consider the difference between energy and free energy in these double - well potentials . to keep the argument simple ,",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the special case of a symmetric double - well ; it applies as well to the asymmetric case .    if the double - well is initially symmetric and if it couples to the shear stress @xmath71 with a coupling constant @xmath72 ( the coupling constant has the dimension of a volume ) , then the asymmetry @xmath73 under the stress is @xmath74 .",
    "one well has the energy @xmath75 , the other has the energy @xmath76 .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the population of the two wells is given by their boltzmann factors .",
    "it is easy to calculate the energy @xmath77 of the equilibrated system in the limit of a small stress @xmath78 this is the energy transported to the heat bath in the equilibration of the relaxing entity after switching on the stress .",
    "the free energy @xmath79 is @xmath80 only half of the energy itself .",
    "if one thinks about it , the reason is clear : spending the energy , one has spanned an entropic spring by the population difference in the two wells .",
    "if one removes the stress slowly , one gets half the energy back .",
    "but if the double - well potential decays , one gets nothing back .",
    "the contribution of the relaxing entity to the compliance is given by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the stress .",
    "but if we now deal with the effect of a renewal of the double - well potential on the viscosity , we have to count the energy .",
    "this means we spend twice as much energy under a constant stress as the one calculated above in our first oversimplified picture . and",
    "this means the viscosity must be a factor of 2 smaller , which implies @xmath81 .",
    "this is reasonably close to the fitted values in table i and ii .    a third quantitative conclusion of the present study is a surprising agreement with the conclusions of plazek et al @xcite from their recoverable shear compliance experiments .",
    "if one takes the parameters of table i to calculate the recoverable compliance , one gets curves which closely resemble those reported by them .",
    "obviously , it is experimentally much easier to detect the andrade creep @xcite in creep experiments than in dynamical ones .",
    "if one calculates @xmath67 from their data , one finds values between 1.5 and 2.3 , similar to those in table i.    here , however , a word of caution is in place . our data , taken as they are ,",
    "do not imply a limited recoverable shear compliance .",
    "in fact , they are well fitted by the bel model @xcite , which has a divergent recoverable compliance . the values in the two tables stem from the assumption that the two retardation spectra of dielectrics and shear ( at least as far as the @xmath0-peak is concerned ) are the same .",
    "the same is true for the fourth conclusion , the validity of the shoving model @xcite .",
    "the fitted @xmath21-values were obtained under the same assumption .    finally , the johari - goldstein peak increases its height with increasing temperature .",
    "the increase follows a boltzmann factor , with a formation energy of about two thirds of the barrier height at the center of the peak .",
    "dielectric and shear relaxation data in seven highly viscous liquids , most of them molecular liquids , were evaluated in terms of a barrier density of independent thermally activated relaxation centers .",
    "three of the substances are type - a glass formers without or with only a very small johari - goldstein peak , four of them show a pronounced johari - goldstein peak .",
    "the most important conclusion is the probable equality of the dielectric and shear retardation spectra , guessed from the raw data and confirmed by a quantitative fit .",
    "the difference in the peak positions is due to the influence of the viscosity .",
    "the johari - goldstein peak has different weight in dielectrics and shear .",
    "the second important conclusion concerns the viscosity .",
    "it seems probable that the viscosity results from the constant renewal of the double - well potentials in the sample within the terminal dielectric relaxation time .",
    "our data support earlier recovery compliance results by plazek et al @xcite , according to which one has an andrade @xcite creep @xmath82 at short times in type - a glass formers ( glass formers without johari - goldstein peak ) .",
    "they further support the shoving model @xcite , which postulates a proportionality between the infinite frequency shear modulus and the arrhenius barrier of the terminal relaxation time .",
