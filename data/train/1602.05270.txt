    "all porous media , whether random or ordered , granular or networked , heterogeneous or homogeneous , are typified by the geometric and topological complexity of the pore - space  @xcite .",
    "this pore - space plays host to a wide range of fluid - borne processes including transport , mixing and dispersion , chemical reaction and microbiological activity , all of which are influenced by the flow structure and transport properties  @xcite .",
    "pore - scale fluid mixing plays a key role in the control of both fluid - fluid reactions ( e.g. redox processes ) and fluid - solid reactions ( e.g. precipitation - dissolution processes ) , which are of importance for a range of subsurface operations , including co@xmath0 sequestration , contaminant remediation or geothermal dipoles management . whilst pore - scale flows are often smooth and steady ( typically stokesian or laminar ) , the inherent topological complexity of the pore - space renders upscaling transport and mixing processes a challenging task .",
    "because of their fundamental role in driving chemical reactions , mixing processes have received increasing attention in recent years in the context of porous media flows  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional laboratory experiments  @xcite and theoretical and modeling studies  @xcite have shown that upscaled chemical kinetics are not captured by classical macro - dispersion theories due to incomplete mixing at the pore scale .",
    "this points to a need for predictive theories for pore - scale concentration statistics which are couched in terms of the underlying medium properties .",
    "lamellar mixing theories , developed in the context of turbulent flows @xcite , have been applied and extended for the prediction of concentration statistics in two - dimensional ( 2d ) darcy scale heterogeneous porous media @xcite .",
    "a central element of this theory is to quantify the link between fluid stretching and mixing . in this context , linking the pore network topological properties to mixing dynamics is an essential step , which we explore in this study .",
    "while the topological constraints associated with the poincar - bendixson theorem limit fluid stretching in two - dimensional ( 2d ) steady flows to be algebraic , in three - dimensional ( 3d ) steady flows much richer behaviour is possible .",
    "indeed , the topological complexity inherent to all three dimensional random porous media has been shown to induce chaotic advection under steady flow conditions via a 3d fluid mechanical analogue of the baker s",
    "map  @xcite .",
    "such chaotic lagrangian dynamics are well - known to rapidly accelerate diffusive mixing and scalar dissipation  @xcite , yet have received little attention with respect to pore - scale flow . from the perspective of transport dynamics",
    ", the distribution of pore sizes and shapes , together with no - slip boundary conditions at the pore walls , are known to impart non - gaussian pore velocity distributions  @xcite , which lead to a rich array of dispersion phenomena ranging from normal to super - diffusive . the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) approach  @xcite has been used to model this behaviours @xcite based on the transit time distributions over characteristic pore lengths , which reflect the distirbution of pore velocities .",
    "the interplay of wide transit time distributions and chaotic advection at the pore - scale impacts both macroscopic transport and dispersion as well as pore - scale dilution .",
    "pore - scale chaotic advection has been shown  @xcite to significantly suppress longitudinal dispersion arising from the no - slip wall condition due to transverse mixing generating an analogue of the taylor - aris mechanism .",
    "conversely , the wide transit time distributions are expected to have a drastic impact on the dynamics of mixing in conjunction with chaotic advection as the transit times set the timescales over which significant stretching of a material fluid element occurs . while the impact of broad transit time distributions on the spatial spreading of transported elements is well understood , their control on mixing dynamics is still an open question .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , lagrangian chaos generates ergodic particle trajectories at the pore - scale , and the associated decaying correlations allows the advection process to be modelled as a stochastic process . during advection through the pore - space ,",
    "fluid elements undergo punctuated stretching and folding ( transverse to the mean flow direction ) events at stagnation points , leading to persistent chaotic advection in random porous media .",
    "such dynamics have been captured in an idealized 3d random pore network model which comprises of a periodic network of uniform - sized pores which alternately branch and merge in the mean flow direction , leading to a high number density of stagnation points local to these pore junctions which generate fluid stretching . whilst highly idealized , this network model contains basic features common to all porous media , namely topology - induced chaotic advection and no - slip boundary conditions , and so represents the minimum complexity inherent to all porous media .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a novel stretching ctrw which captures the advection and deformation of material elements through the porous matrix .",
    "closure of this ctrw model in conjunction with a 1d advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) describing diffusion transverse to highly striated , lamellar concentration distributions generated by pore - scale chaotic advection facilitates quantification of mixing and dispersion of scalar fields under the action of combined chaotic advection and molecular diffusion both within the pore space and across the macroscopic network .",
    "this formalism allows prediction of concentration pdf evolution within the pore - space and quantification of the impact of chaotic advection .    to simplify exposition",
    ", we first consider the somewhat artificial case of a steady state pore - scale mixing and dispersion of a concentration field which is heterogeneous at the pore - scale but homogeneous at the macro - scale continuously injected across all pores in a plane transverse to the mean flow direction .",
    "these results are then extended to the more realistic situation of the evolution of a solvent plume which is continuously injected as a point source .",
    "we compare these predictions for three distinctly different porous networks , a random 3d porous network which gives rise to lagrangian chaos , an ordered 3d porous network which generates maximum fluid stretching , and an ordered 2d network which gives rise to non - chaotic dynamics .",
    "hence the impact of both network topology and structure upon pore - scale mixing and dispersion is quantified .",
    "these results form a quantitative basis for upscaling of pore - scale dynamics to macroscopic mixing and transport models , and establish the impacts of ubiquitous chaotic mixing in 3d random porous media .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; the mechanisms leading to topological mixing in 3d porous media are briefly reviewed in @xmath1  [ sec : topomix ] , followed by a description of the 3d open porous network model in @xmath1  [ sec:3dmodel ] .",
    "fluid stretching in this model network is considered in @xmath1  [ section : stretch ] , from which a stretching ctrw model is derived in @xmath1  [ sec : ctrw ] .",
    "this model is then applied to quantify mixing in @xmath1  [ sec : mixing ] , and the implications for the evolution of the concentration pdf , mixing scale and dispersion are conisdered in @xmath1  [ sec : diffmix ] .",
    "the overall results are discussed in @xmath1  [ sec : discussion ] and finally conclusions are made in @xmath1  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "topological complexity is a defining feature of all porous media - from granular and packed media to fractured and open networks - these materials are typified by a highly connected pore - space within which the flow of continua arise .",
    "such topological complexity is characterised by the euler characteristic @xmath2 ( related to the topological genus @xmath3 as @xmath4 ) which measures the connectivity of the pore - space  @xcite as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of pores , @xmath7 the number of redundant connections and @xmath8 the number of completely enclosed cavities . for porous media",
    "it is meaningful to consider the average number density of these quantities , where from computer tomography studies  @xcite it is found that typically @xmath6 is large whilst @xmath7 , @xmath8 are small . hence the number density of the euler characteristic @xmath2",
    "is uniformly found to be strongly negative  @xcite , reflecting the basic topological complexity which typifies all porous media .",
    "when a continuous fluid is advected through such media , a large number of stagnation points ( non - degenerate equilibrium points ) arise at the fluid / solid boundary as a direct result of this topological complexity .",
    "these stagnation points @xmath9 are zeros of the skin friction vector field @xmath10 on the 2d boundary @xmath11 of the fluid domain @xmath12 , where @xmath10 may be defined as @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the fluid velocity field , @xmath15 is the coordinate normal to the fluid boundary @xmath11 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are orthogonal coordinates tangent to this boundary . whilst different definitions of the skin friction are possible  @xcite , these are all equivalent on the boundary @xmath11 , as is the topology of the flow structure in the fluid domain @xmath12 .",
    "the poincar - hopf theorem provides a direct relationship between the nature of the critical points @xmath9 and the pore - space topology , such that the sum of the indices @xmath18 of critical points @xmath9 is related to the topological genus @xmath3 and euler characteristic @xmath2 as @xmath19 where the index @xmath18 equals -1 for saddle - type zeros , + 1 for node - type zeros and 0 for null zeros of the skin - friction field .",
    "hence @xmath20 represents a lower bound for the number density of stagnation points under steady 3d stokes flow , and these points impart significant fluid stretching into the local fluid domain .",
    "digital imaging studies  @xcite measure the euler characteristic across a broad range of porous media , from granular to networked , and find @xmath2 to be strongly negative , with number densities of the order @xmath21200 - 500 mm@xmath22 .",
    "this large number density of stagnation points imparts a series of punctuated stretching events as the fluid continuum is advected through the pore - space .",
    "a relevant question is what role these stretching events play with respect to transport and mixing in porous media ?",
    "stagnation points play a critical role with respect to the lagrangian dynamics of 3d steady flows , as it is at these points that the formal analogy between transport in steady 3d volume - preserving flows and 1 degree - of - freedom hamiltonian systems breaks down  @xcite ( such that the steady 3d dynamical system can no longer be expressed as an analogous unsteady 2d system ) , and such points are widely  @xcite implicated in the creation of non - trivial lagrangian dynamics .",
    "@xcite proposes that the stable @xmath23 and unstable @xmath24 manifolds which respectively correspond to the fluid contraction and stretching directions around stagnation points ( shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] ) form the `` skeleton '' of the flow , a set of surfaces of minimal transverse flux which organize transport within the fluid domain .",
    "if these manifolds which project into the fluid bulk are two - dimensional ( hence co - dimension one ) , they form essentially impenetrable barriers which organise fluid transport and mixing .    [",
