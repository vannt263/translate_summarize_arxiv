    "this paper has a very modest scope : we present our `` operational system '' for hamiltonian mechanics on cotangent bundles @xmath0 , based on moving frames . in a related work @xcite , we will present some concrete examples to convey the algorithmical nature of this formalism .",
    "a powerful tool in riemannian geometry is the `` method of moving frames '' , introduced by lie cartan . actually , moving frames appeared earlier in lagrangian mechanics : poincar presented in 1901 a moving frame version of the euler - lagrange equations , later refered as the `` quasi - coordinates '' method .",
