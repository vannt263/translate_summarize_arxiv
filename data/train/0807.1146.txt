    "the recent advancement in the knowledge and fabrication techniques of nanoscopic systems has revealed a great variety of novel physical behaviours , a striking example of which is the observation of the phenomenon now known as the _ quantum mirage _ @xcite .",
    "this effect arises in nanoscopic systems called quantum corrals , where the electron wave functions are confined to a finite region by means of a barrier formed by atoms encircling a closed region in space .",
    "quantum corrals are built by positioning atoms , typically transition metal atoms , along a closed line on the clean surfaces of noble metals . in their recent experiments ,",
    "manoharan et .",
    "al.@xcite have built elliptical corrals with co atoms on the ( 111 ) surface of cu .",
    "the cu ( 111 ) surface has a band of surface states , orthogonal to the bulk states , which can be represented as a two dimensional electron gas confined at the surface .",
    "the fermi level is placed at 450 mev above the bottom of the surface state band .",
    "the atoms forming the corral act as scattering centers which tend to confine the surface electrons inside the corral .    a number of theoretical papers analyzed these experiments with one or more impurities considering different configurations agam , aligia , weissmann , porras , fiete , armandochiappe , lobos , nos1,nos2 ( see also complete review articles in @xcite ) . in refs . nos1,nos2",
    "it was suggested that , as a consequence of the focalizing properties of quantum elliptic corrals , two impurities located at the foci of the system will strongly interact .",
    "such a prediction has been supported by stepanyuk _",
    "@xcite who reported results of first principle calculations of the exchange coupling between magnetic impurities inside quantum corrals .",
    "the physical properties of quantum corrals are affected by several factors , which include confinement , quantum interference and many - body effects .",
    "so far , interest has been focused on the static properties of quantum corrals , leaving the dynamical behaviour of such systems almost unexplored .    in this work",
    "we have studied static and dynamical physical properties of elliptical quantum corrals for various models and perturbations , where the focalizing properties of the system have important consequences in the physical behaviour .",
    "we have considered two cases .",
    "the first one consisted of an isolated ellipse describing a closed quantum system containing an arbitrary number of non - interacting electrons up to a certain fermi energy .",
    "the system was perturbed by either local potentials located on the foci of the ellipse , or a potential in the form of a barrier cutting the ellipse through its minor axis . in the second case ,",
    "two impurity spins interacting via a superexchange term with the electrons in the ellipse were added to the foci of the system .",
    "this many - body problem was treated numerically and static properties like the spin gap , and dynamical responses , including real - time behaviour , where analyzed .",
    "throughout this work we have adopted a simplified description of the system , based on a spinless tight - binding model defined on a discretized square lattice within the boundaries of the ellipse , with eccentricity @xmath2 and hopping element @xmath3 between nearest neighbours .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case is simple and reads @xmath4 , where the sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 run inside the ellipse which consists of around 1000 sites or atoms .",
    "here we have considered a constant zero local energy in each site . as we will be analyzing low - energy wave functions with wave lengths much larger that the real interatomic distance , the underlying atomic distribution is irrelevant@xcite .",
    "our calculations could have also relied on the exact solutions for a continuum ellipse ( mathieu functions ) .",
    "the fermi energy was set to coincide with its @xmath7 eigenstate @xmath8 , which is similar to the state at the fermi energy in the experimental setup of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] ( see fig .",
    "this configuration is not crucial for the main conclusions and other eccentricities and reference levels will have a similar behaviour , as long as the wave function bears an appreciable weight at the foci of the ellipse .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the wave function at the fermi energy when , at time @xmath9 a constant negative or positive potential @xmath10 is applied to focus 1 : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . figs .",
    "1 , 2 and 3 show the square of the amplitude of such a wave function in foci 1 and 2 for @xmath13 , for three distinct cases corresponding to @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "we notice that in the two first figures , a finite time @xmath17 elapses between the onset of the perturbation in focus 1 and the observation of the response in focus 2 , as shown in the insets which is of the order of @xmath18s , where we have used @xmath19ev ( see below ) .",
    "another interesting point regards the oscillatory behaviour of the two squared amplitudes for @xmath20 .",
    "the occurrence of oscillations in the probability amplitude in the presence of a time - independent potential ( for @xmath21 ) , as well as the overall  see - saw \" or alternating behaviour between both foci , i.e. , when the probability is high in one focus it is low in the other and viceversa ( except for the higher order oscillations in focus 1 for negative @xmath10 ) , are intimately related to quantum interference effects within the ellipse .",
    "the period of these oscillations is of the order of the energy difference corresponding to the main transitions involved , _",
    "i.e. _ states 18 , 23 and 29 for this configuration . using the parameters of refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of the ellipse on the copper [ 111 ] surface , i.e. distance between foci @xmath22 @xmath23 , total ellipse area @xmath24 nm@xmath25 and @xmath19ev , we obtain periods of the order of @xmath26 s , where @xmath27mev ( the transition between states 23 and 29 has a similar value ) .",
    "we remark that this energy is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the kondo temperature in quantum dots .",
    "an animated version of these behaviours is found in @xcite .",
    "we notice that the amplitude of oscillation in focus 1 is larger than that in focus 2 when @xmath10 is negative ( attractive potential , fig .",
    "1 ) , and smaller when @xmath10 is positive ( repulsive potential , fig .",
    "2 ) .    , applied in focus 1 at time @xmath9 .",
    "insets depict short times and @xmath17 is the time elapsed until the perturbation reaches the unperturbed focus . for @xmath28 ev , typical periods in this figure",
    "are around @xmath29s.,width=264,height=151 ]    .,width=264,height=151 ]    .,width=264,height=151 ]    as a matter of corroboration , using the above set of parameters we obtain for the fermi velocity of the electrons involved in the transmission of the information from one focus to the other the value @xmath30 cm / s ( were we have considered the focal distance @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , which is of the same order of magnitude as the one calculated in @xcite .    we have also calculated the delay time and fermi velocity for parameters corresponding to semiconductors , where , for an effective mass @xmath33 the energy difference of the main transition is around @xmath34ev and @xmath35 s , which leads to a fermi velocity of around @xmath36cm / s and an electron density of @xmath37 , which is somewhat higher than the typical carrier densities in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting case was the response to an infinitely large potential barrier along the minor axis applied at times @xmath13 , starting from the same state as in the previous case ( state 23 ) . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we see the evolution which is quite periodic with a frequency corresponding to the energy difference between the most relevant states involved ( states 15 , 16 and 25 , 26 of the semi - ellipses , as shown in the approximate evolution where only these states were included ) .",
    "we , thus , observe here that due to the symmetry of the problem and the energy structure of the ellipse , only very few states take part and the time evolution becomes simple and robust .    .",
    "solid and dot lines correspond to the time evolution of the exact and aproximate wave functions respectively .",
    "b ) modulus of the overlap between the non - perturbed and final wave functions after the potential barrier had been applied during an interval @xmath38 and then removed ( note the different parameters in the x - axis used both figures).,width=264,height=264 ]    if , on the other hand , we leave the barrier potential on only for a finite time @xmath39 and then calculate the overlap of the original wave function to the remaining one after having removed the perturbation , we find another oscillatory behaviour between a nearly complete recovery of the original wave function and a nearly completely orthogonal state ( see fig .",
    "in addition to the one - particle behaviour studied in the previous section , we have analyzed the more interesting case of the effect of the focalizing properties of the ellipse on the interaction between two spins interacting via a superexchange term with the electron spins in the ellipse ( fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads :    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the number operator and @xmath45 the destruction operator of an electron with spin @xmath46 in focus @xmath5 of the ellipse .",
    "in the basis of eigenstates @xmath47 of the ellipse , these local operators can be expanded as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the destruction operator and amplitude in state @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath51 is the hamiltonian of the isolated ellipse with infinite walls described in sect .",
    "ii .    in this basis",
    "the spin operators are expressed as : @xmath52     for the non - interacting ellipse with eccentricity @xmath2 .",
    "white and black represent high and low electron densities respectively .",
    "b ) graphical representation of the system considered here where @xmath53 represents an eigenstate of the non - perturbed ellipse . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the impurity spins at the foci of the ellipse which interact with the localized spins @xmath56 via a superexchange interaction @xmath1.,width=264,height=226 ]      we have solved this hamiltonian numerically with exact diagonalization for a small number of levels and using the lanczos technique for larger systems and different fillings corresponding to an even ( closed shell ) or odd ( open shell ) number of particles , @xmath57 .",
    "the results for the spin gap @xmath58 are depicted in fig . 6 where we find a different behaviour for even and odd number of electrons in the ellipse . for the former case",
    "we observe a slow increase of the spin gap as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath1 which is quadratic and linear for small and large @xmath1 respectively .",
    "for an odd number of electrons the behaviour is linear from the beginning and the gap is somewhat larger than for the even filling",
    ". one can understand this behaviour by using perturbation theory .",
    "for the even case ( closed shell ) the first correction to the energy stems from second - order non - degenerate terms while for the odd filling ( open shell ) , a first - order degenerate expansion is required , leading to a linear dependence .     with @xmath1 for even ( triangules ) and odd ( circles ) number of electrons in the ellipse . , width=302,height=226 ]    for a realistic value @xcite of the superexchange parameter for the cu ellipse , @xmath59ev , we obtain @xmath60 and a corresponding gap of around @xmath61 ev@xmath62 k for even filling , temperature under which the system is in a stable singlet state . for the semiconductor ellipse",
    "the spin gap could be around 10 times larger although we do not have any reliable estimation of @xmath1 in this case .",
    "thus , in both cases , copper or semiconducting corrals , this singlet state could be observed at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "one of the most important consequences of impurity spins in the presence of an elliptical corral like the one considered here is their enhanced correlation when situated at the foci of the system .",
    "for example , by analyzing the spin - spin correlation function in the ground state @xmath63 we find that they form a singlet or triplet for small @xmath1 and even or odd particles , respectively ( see fig .",
    "a ferromagnetic interaction between localized spins for odd numbers of electrons in the ellipse was also found in @xcite .",
    "for larger values of the interaction parameter both impurity spins decorrelate .",
    "the results are weakly dependent on the number of levels considered , as also shown here .",
    "even , for the first excited state ( having total spin @xmath64 ) showing the triplet character between the localized spins in both foci for small @xmath1 .",
    "lower panel : correlation function between the localized spin @xmath54 and the spin of the itinerant electron @xmath65 compared to the spin - spin correlation between localized spins for even @xmath57 ( for the ground state in all cases ) . for small @xmath1",
    "the localized spins are entangled in a singlet state with no correlation with the electrons . for large @xmath1 , these spins decouple while enhancing the local singlet interaction with the itinerant electron.,width=264,height=264 ]    it is also interesting to analyze the on - site correlation between the localized spin @xmath54 and the spin of the electron localized immediately above it , @xmath66 . in fig .",
    "7(b ) we show how this interaction , which is antiferromgnetic , strengthens by increasing @xmath1 , while @xmath54 decorrelates from @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath1 increases , the electrons in the ellipse become more localized near the impurity in order to take advantage of the magnetic interaction and the spin - spin correlation should grow towards the singlet value -0.75 .",
    "we find a lower absolute value for large @xmath1 and this is due to the finiteness of the system . in this limit , many more extended states are required to form the localized state ( see eq .",
    "we have calculated the spin response function to a spin excitation performed in focus 1@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68     for an even number of particles , three values of @xmath1 and different number of levels in the ellipse showing a negligible  finite size \" effect . for small values of @xmath1",
    "the spin gap is small and the first excitation is mainly a triplet state .",
    "see also fig.7(b ) , top panel.,width=264,height=264 ]    , width=264,height=264 ]     for small and moderate interactions . for small @xmath1",
    "the correlation is nearly a triplet as seen in previous figures.,width=264,height=264 ]    in figs .",
    "8 and 9 we show the results for different values of @xmath1 and for even and odd fillings , respectively . for even @xmath57",
    "we find that the excitations for small @xmath1 consist mainly of one peak located at the spin gap , which is small . in this case",
    "both localized spins form a very well defined singlet , whereas the first spin excitation has a triplet character as can be seen in figs .",
    "7(b ) ( top panel ) and 10(a ) ( see below ) . for larger values of @xmath1",
    "the spectral weight of this peak diminishes , other states get involved and the spectral function is more complicated ( see also larger values of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "7(b ) ) . for odd @xmath57 and small @xmath1",
    "both localized spins form a well defined triplet in the ground state and the first spin excitation corresponds to a spin flip of an electron spin , leaving @xmath54 and @xmath55 still entangled in a triplet state . in both cases a negligible  size \" dependence with the number of levels considered is found .",
    "the fact that , for small @xmath1 and an even number of particles , the first excitation is nearly purely a triplet can also be seen as a robust excitation which varies very slowly in time ( see fig .",
    "10 ) . here",
    "we depict @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 the time - evolution operator and @xmath72 is the interacting ground state . for @xmath73",
    "we find a nearly constant behaviour , scrumbling up with a larger amount of eigenstates for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the factor 1/4 which arises when comparing this correlation to a pure triplet behaviour stems from the perturbation operator @xmath74 applied to the ground state ( the function @xmath75 is not normalized ) .",
    "we have studied static and dynamical properties of hard - wall elliptical quantum corrals subject to different kinds of perturbations .",
    "on one hand we considered non - interacting systems and applied localized perturbation potentials in the foci and along the minor axis of the ellipse , finding robust oscillatory behaviours which are a consequence of the small amount of levels involved in the excitations .",
    "a finite elapse was found in the case that the potential was applied to one focus until the perturbation reaches the unperturbed one . on the other hand we studied the interacting case where two localized spins at the foci of the ellipse interacted antiferromagnetically with the itinerant electrons . in this case",
    "we found a different behaviour for even and odd electrons which shows up in the spin gap , the character of the ground state and the excitations .",
    "for the even particle number case and small interaction @xmath1 , both localized spins are entangled in a ( quasi)-singlet state , forming a ( quasi)-triplet in the first excitated state , which is the main spin excitation .",
    "these states are very robust , however , the spin gap is quadratically small with @xmath1 .",
    "an interesting feature can be seen which resembles the rkky - kondo like transition occurring in the two - impurity system when increasing the kondo interaction @xmath1 : while the localized spins form a singlet state for small interaction , this coupling decreases for larger @xmath1 giving rise to an on - site singlet correlation between the spin and the itinerant electron .    in this work",
    "we have shown that the focalizing properties of elliptic corrals lead to an interesting behaviour between localized spins . for small @xmath1 and even number of electrons in the ellipse",
    ", the system can be modelled by two spins interacting via an effective antiferromagnetic interaction parameter @xmath76 , where @xmath77 . for odd number of electrons",
    "the interaction is ferromagnetic in the ground state .",
    "the character of this interaction can be controlled by changing the chemical potential of the system .    for small to moderate values of @xmath1 ( @xmath78 ) the main results synthesized above still hold in the case of more realistic models of quantum ellipses which include tunneling of the electrons in open corrals and inelastic processes with bulk electrons . in this parameter",
    "range the broadening of the relevant energy levels is smaller than their separation@xcite .",
