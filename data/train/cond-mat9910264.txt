    "density functional theory ( dft ) has been the subject of remarkable developments since its original formulation by hohenberg and kohn ( hk ) @xcite . after formal improvements , extensions , and an uncountable number of applications to a wide variety of physical problems ,",
    "this theoretical approach has become the most efficient , albeit not infallible , method of determining the electronic properties of matter from first principles @xcite .",
    "the most important innovation of dft , which is actually at the origin of its breakthrough , is to replace the wave function by the electronic density @xmath18 as the fundamental variable of the many - body problem . in practice , density functional ( df ) calculations are largely based on the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme that reduces the many - body @xmath19-particle problem to the solution of a set of self - consistent single - particle equations @xcite . although this transformation is formally exact , the implementations always require approximations , since the ks equations involve functional derivatives of the unknown interaction energy @xmath20 $ ] , usually expressed in terms of the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "therefore , understanding the functional dependence of @xmath21 $ ] and improving its approximations are central to the development of df methods .",
    "the currently most widespread _ anstze _ for @xmath21 $ ] the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite with spin polarized @xcite and gradient corrected extensions @xcite were originally derived from exact results for the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to investigate the properties of the interaction - energy functional from an intrinsically inhomogeneous point of view , namely , by considering exactly solvable many - body lattice models .    despite the remarkable success of the local spin density approximation ,",
    "present dft fails systematically in accounting for phenomena where strong electron correlations play a central role , for example , in heavy - fermion materials or high-@xmath22 superconductors .",
    "these systems are usually described by simplifying the low - energy electron dynamics using parameterized lattice models such as pariser - parr - pople,@xcite hubbard,@xcite or anderson@xcite models and related hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "being in principle an exact theory , the limitations of the df approach have to be ascribed to the approximations used for exchange and correlation and not to the underlying hks formalism .",
    "it would be therefore very interesting to extend the range of applicability of dft to strongly correlated systems and to characterize the properties @xmath23 in the limit of strong correlations .",
    "studies of the xc functional on simple models should provide useful insights for future extensions to realistic hamiltonians . moreover , taking into account the demonstrated power of the df approach in _ ab initio _ calculations , one may also expect that a dft with an appropriate @xmath23 could become an efficient tool for studying many - body models , a subject of theoretical interest on its own .",

    "the local site occupancies were treated as the basic variables .",
    "some years later schindlmayr and godby @xcite provided a different formulation of dft on a lattice by considering as basic variables both diagonal elements @xmath24 and off - diagonal elements @xmath0 of the single - particle density matrix ( see also @xcite ) .",
