    "the preparation and manipulations of photonic states by using an atom or a quantum dot play an important role in quantum information processing .",
    "atoms , ions or quantum dots are essential components of many optical quantum information processing devices  @xcite , which have been proposed  @xcite or demonstrated  @xcite over past ten years . in such devices",
    "it is very useful to be able to transfer qubit between the atomic state and the field state  @xcite .",
    "typically researchers perform a state - mapping operation using stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite because of the robustness of this technique against different experimental imperfections .",
    "however , if the state - mapping operation has to be really fast then stirap is not a proper choice , since pulses should vary slow enough to fulfil the adiabaticity criterion .",
    "if computational speed is very important then the state - mapping operation via raman transition should be based on rabi oscillations between these two states , in which qubit is encoded .",
    "this method is much more demanding than stirap , but it is probably that the near future technology will satisfy its all requirements . in the paper",
    "@xcite authors have discussed quantum operations via rabi oscillations performed in a three - level system in the @xmath0-configuration with focus on improving fidelity .",
    "the authors have shown that it is possible in this system to achieve high enough fidelity to make these operations useful in future quantum computations , i.e. , the authors have shown that one can achieve the fidelity differing from unity by @xmath1 , required by large quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "such high fidelities are a result of using fine tuning technique , which prevents a reduction of the fidelity by the population of the third ( auxiliary ) level .",
    "in this paper , we study the state - mapping operation performed in a v - type three - level system .",
    "the quantum interference manifested in the v - type system leads to many important effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency , quenching of spontaneous emission , lasing without inversion , unexpected population inversion , quantum beats despite the incoherent pumping etc .",
    "@xcite , and therefore , this system is useful in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of v - type systems as memory elements is limited because of spontaneous emission from excited states , however , if the time of a quantum operation is much shorter than the decoherence time then it is possible to consider these systems as a candidate for qubit  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the state - mapping operation in v - type systems can be fast and the fidelity can be high enough to make such systems useful in large quantum algorithms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section 2 with a description of the model . in section 3",
    ", we prove that it is impossible to transfer perfectly the qubit encoded in excited atomic states to the state of a cavity field mode using a single rectangular laser pulse . in section 4",
    ", we show that an approximate state mapping is possible for long operation times only . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we present the two - stage state - mapping protocol that performs the transfer almost perfectly . numerical results ( section 7 )",
    "show that this protocol is fast and the fidelity satisfies the requirement of large quantum algorithms . in sections 8 and 9 , we investigate the influence of field and atomic ( respectively ) damping on this protocol and we show that in some special case the fidelity of the state mapping in the v - type system can be higher than in @xmath0-type system .",
    "the state - mapping operation is performed using a device , which is formed of an atom ( or an atom - like structure ) trapped inside a cavity .",
    "this atom or atom - like structure plays the role of memory component and we assume that it can be modeled by a three - level system in the v - configuration .",
    "the setup and the level scheme are sketched in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the quantum information is encoded in a superposition of two excited levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we can operate on this quantum information using two transitions to the intermediate level @xmath4 , which is the ground level .",
    "the first transition @xmath5 is coupled to the cavity mode with a frequency @xmath6 and coupling strength @xmath7 .",
    "the second transition @xmath8 is driven by a classical laser field with a frequency @xmath9 and coupling strength @xmath10 . the classical laser field and the quantized cavity mode are equally detuned from the corresponding transition frequencies by @xmath11 .",
    "the v - type level configuration can not be considered as an ideal memory because , contrary to the @xmath0-type system , a qubit is here encoded in a superposition of two excited states , and thus , the time of storage of quantum information is limited by the spontaneous emission .",
    "spontaneous emission rates from levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 we denote by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively",
    ". however , new technology shows that it is possible to build devices where the coherent coupling strength is much greater than the spontaneous transition rate  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the coupling strength @xmath7 between quantum dot and the microcavity mode is 80 times greater than spontaneous emission rate @xmath14 for the same transition .",
    "therefore , the v - type level structure can be considered as a short - term memory useful in quantum information processing .",
    "such large values of @xmath7 compared to @xmath14 are possible for microcavities since @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the square of the cavity mode volume .",
    "unfortunately , the cavity decay rate @xmath15 increases with decreasing the cavity length , and therefore , @xmath16 in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to assume that the finesse of microcavities will be improved in the future and the coherent coupling will dominate all dissipative rates .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the atom ( or the quantum dot ) with the cavity field mode is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the atomic flip operators and @xmath19 denotes the annihilation operator of the cavity mode .",
    "let us consider the case of the unitary evolution of the system , i.e. , we assume that @xmath15 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are equal to zero .",
    "the quantum information encoded in the atomic state @xmath20 has to be mapped perfectly and quickly onto the cavity field state : @xmath21 . here",
    ", we have denoted a state of the system consisting of the atomic state @xmath22 and the cavity field with @xmath23 photons by @xmath24 .",
    "so , we have to perform quantum operation defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "is it possible to achieve this task using the evolution governed by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) ?",
    "let us investigate this problem .",
    "the evolution of the state @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 from  ( [ eq : solution0u7 ] ) one can see that the population of the state @xmath27 will be fully transferred to the state @xmath32 if three conditions will be satisfied , i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "taking into account two first conditions we can express the third one in the form @xmath36 equation  ( [ eq : con0 ] ) leads to a discrete set of detunings  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a natural odd number and @xmath40 is a non - negative integer .",
    "so , the population is fully transferred from the state @xmath27 to @xmath32 if and only if the value of detuning satisfies condition  ( [ eq : gen5 ] ) and the operation time @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 if we assume that @xmath43 then it is seen from  ( [ eq : evolution10 ] ) and  ( [ eq : solution0u7 ] ) that such a perfect @xmath44 pulse is given by @xmath45    the state - mapping operation requires also that the population of the state @xmath46 has to remain unchanged . in the case of three - level @xmath0 systems",
    "the state @xmath46 experiences no dynamics .",
    "therefore , in such systems the perfect state - mapping operation ( also defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) can be easily achieved .",
    "the situation , however , is considerably more complicated for three - level @xmath47 systems . in @xmath47 systems",
    "the time evolution is given by @xmath48/(2\\nu ' ) \\ , , \\\\",

    "it is worth to mention here that these above equations hold also for @xmath50 . during the evolution described by  ( [ eq:200 ] ) the population of the intermediate state",
    "is given by @xmath51 the condition @xmath26 is fulfilled up to a phase factor if the operation time is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a positive integer .",
    "since the state - mapping operation requires both conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , an operation time @xmath54 has to be equal to  ( [ eq : tpi ] ) and  ( [ eq : tpini ] ) , and the detuning has to satisfy  ( [ eq : gen5 ] ) .",
    "these three conditions lead to a diophantine equation @xmath55 it follows from  ( [ eq : diophantine ] ) that the numbers @xmath56 and @xmath57 should be both odd or both even",
    ". however , the numbers @xmath56 and @xmath57 will never be both odd or both even , because @xmath58 is always an odd number .",
    "thus ,  ( [ eq : diophantine ] ) has no solutions in natural numbers @xmath56 , @xmath59 , @xmath58 with @xmath58 odd",
    ".    one can see that three - level @xmath47 systems have important drawback .",
    "the fidelity of the state - mapping operation is always reduced by the population of the intermediate level , and therefore the perfect state mapping using single rectangular laser pulse is impossible in three - level v - type systems .",
    "moreover , it seems likely that there is no prefect state mapping consisting of more than one laser pulse .",
    "however , it is hard to prove it because there are infinitely many possible sequences of laser pulses  from two different pulses to series of very many ultra - short pulses as in  @xcite .",
    "we already know that there is no perfect state - mapping operation in three - level @xmath47 systems , i.e. , @xmath41 will be never equal to @xmath60",
    ". however , @xmath41 can be very close to @xmath60 for some special numbers @xmath56 , @xmath59 , and @xmath58 . in such cases it is possible to perform an approximate state - mapping operation with the operation time @xmath61 .",
    "now we investigate if approximate state - mapping operations can satisfy the fidelity requirement of large quantum algorithms .",
    "of course , the fidelity of approximate state - mapping operations is state dependent , and therefore , we need the minimum fidelity taken over all possible input states in our investigation .",
    "since computational speed is also very important , the times of these operations @xmath54 should be not too long .",
    "we have calculated the minimal fidelity of state mapping for all such @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 , for which the operation time is shorter than some fixed time limit @xmath62 .",
    "we have found that there are only fourteen different state - mapping operations , which can satisfy the fidelity requirement of large quantum algorithms @xmath63 and take less time than the chosen time limit @xmath62 .",
    "we have only fourteen different values of the detuning , which we can choose .",
    "the shortest approximate state - mapping operation lasts @xmath64 and is determined by @xmath65 .",
    "so , it is possible to perform the approximate state mapping , but such an approximate state mapping can not be short and achieve very high fidelity at once .",
    "the state - mapping operation performed using a single rectangular laser pulse in @xmath47-type systems can not achieve fidelity equal to unity .",

    "the problem comes from the fact that the states @xmath27 and @xmath46 ( which belong to orthogonal subspaces \\{@xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath66 } and \\{@xmath46 , @xmath67 } ) evolve with noncommensurate frequencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) .",
    "the operations @xmath25 and @xmath26 require the @xmath44 pulse and the @xmath74 pulse , respectively .",
    "since @xmath75 and @xmath76 are noncommensurate , the duration times of these pulses are always different , and therefore , there is no rectangular pulse which can perform operations @xmath25 and @xmath26 simultaneously .",

    "inset : the pulses sequence.,width=302 ]    the main idea of such a two - stage state - mapping protocol is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "thus , in the first stage of this protocol we need an operation , which changes only the state that belongs to the subspace \\{@xmath46 , @xmath67 } and leaves the state belonging to the other subspace unchanged .",
    "this needed operation is just the intense laser pulse operation .",
    "it is clearly seen from equations  ( [ eq : evolution10 ] ) , ( [ eq : solution0u7 ] ) and  ( [ eq:200 ] ) that when the laser pulse is very intensive @xmath79 then @xmath80 , and therefore , the state @xmath27 experiences almost no dynamics while the population of the state @xmath46 oscillates with a very high frequency . in the following",

    "from  ( [ eq : to03 ] ) it is seen that we can set arbitrary populations of the states @xmath46 and @xmath67 for @xmath90 .",
    "it is also seen that we can easily give an arbitrary phase shift to the state @xmath67 with respect to the state @xmath46 just by setting proper argument of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "so we can always produce the state @xmath93 for large enough @xmath94 .",
    "we can calculate amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath96 by premultiplying @xmath78 by @xmath97 .",
    "we also assume that in the second stage of the protocol , i.e. , during the perfect @xmath44 pulse we change the intensity and the phase of the laser field that @xmath43 . in this way we get @xmath98/(2\\nu_\\pi ' ) \\ ,   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 .",
    "a comparison of the moduli of the amplitudes  ( [ eq : to03 ] ) and  ( [ eq : to08 ] ) leads to @xmath100    in order to find the proper argument of @xmath10 we write  ( [ eq : to03 ] ) and  ( [ eq : to08 ] ) in terms of the moduli and the arguments of @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath101 where @xmath102 the arguments of phase factors are given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the argument of @xmath7 and @xmath106 is 0 or even for @xmath107 and odd for @xmath108 .",
    "now it is easy to check that if we chose such @xmath109 that the condition @xmath110 is fulfilled then @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is an integer .",
    "the protocol that is able to achieve fidelity as close to unity as it is needed consists of two stages : ( a ) the evolution - shift stage , and ( b ) the @xmath44 pulse stage .",
    "initially , the quantum system is prepared in the state @xmath114 for simplicity , we assume here , and in the following , that @xmath7 is a real positive number .",

    "the @xmath44 pulse operation is described by @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "so , after this @xmath44 pulse operation the system state is given by @xmath125 if we set @xmath126 then the protocol ends up with the state @xmath127 the condition @xmath126 leads to @xmath128 .",
    "results obtained using  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) show that the fidelity of the state - mapping protocol tends to unity for large @xmath129",
    ". however , we have to keep in mind that the hamiltonian given by  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) describes the quantum system composed of the v - type atom or atom - like structure and the cavity in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "this means that we can not set @xmath129 too high because  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) will be unreliable  @xcite .",
    "the careful choice of @xmath129 is especially important in the performing of state mapping with a very high fidelity .",
    "therefore , we have to take into account in our considerations counter - rotating terms which are neglected in rwa .",
    "the hamiltonian without rwa is given by @xmath130 here , we have assumed that the classical laser field and the quantized cavity mode field are @xmath131 and @xmath132 polarized , respectively . we can estimate the error introduced by the counter - rotating terms using  ( [ eq : rwa01 ] ) and time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the quantum system , which is initially prepared in the state @xmath27 should remain in this state after the first stage .",
    "assuming that @xmath133 and @xmath79 , the probability that it will be found in other state can be roughly approximated by @xmath134 one can see that the first term of  ( [ eq : rwa02 ] ) , which represents the error introduced by terms @xmath135 , is in agreement with  ( [ eq : to02 ] ) .",
    "the second term represents the error introduced by the counter - rotating terms .",
    "now it is easy to check that rwa is justified for atoms . for atoms ,",
    "typically @xmath136 is of order 10 mhz and @xmath137  mhz , so @xmath138 is smaller than @xmath139 up to @xmath140 .",
    "the situation is more complicated for quantum dots .",
    "we will consider the case of quantum dots later .",
    "let us see capabilities of the state - mapping protocol and check the derived formulas using numerical computations .",
    "first , we examine the protocol for a great value of the detuning @xmath141 . here , and in the following , we set @xmath68  mhz . for @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    "we obtain @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "it is seen that the total time of the protocol is much shorter than the time of the shortest approximate state - mapping solution .",
    "it is also worth to note that @xmath148 , which means that the state - mapping protocol for v - type systems is almost as fast as state mapping in @xmath0-type systems .",
    "the fidelity is very close to one , so it is almost as high as fidelity of state mapping in @xmath0-type systems . according to  ( [ eq : to02 ] ) we can increase the fidelity .",
    "the fidelity of the state - mapping protocol should tend to unity as @xmath10 becomes large . in order to check it we repeat these calculation for @xmath149 and we obtain @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . as expected from  ( [ eq : to02 ] ) , the error probability is proportional to @xmath153",
    ".    we can come to the same conclusions simulating the state - mapping protocol for small values of @xmath154 .",
    "for example , @xmath155 and @xmath143 lead to @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",

    "it is also seen that the fidelity is smaller than in case of large @xmath154 .",
    "this , however , is not a problem",
    ". we can always increase the fidelity by increasing @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath149 we obtain @xmath156 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the evolution of the state of real optical cavities is not unitary because of absorption of photons in mirrors . in some of devices photons",
    "can also leak out of the cavity through a semitransparent mirror .",
    "such a photon leakage is very important when quantum information encoded in the photonic state of the cavity has to be transferred to a distant quantum system .",
    "we can take into account these photon losses assuming that cavity decay rate @xmath15 is greater than zero .",
    "let us now consider the effect of non - zero @xmath15 on operations needed by the state - mapping protocol , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    as mentioned above ,",

    "hence , the time of the operation @xmath26 is still given by  ( [ eq : tpini ] ) .",

    "from  ( [ eq : evol10k2 ] ) , it is easy to check that the population of the intermediate state @xmath172 is greater than zero for @xmath173 .",
    "this means that the state - mapping operation can not be perfect for @xmath174 .",
    "computed numerically versus time for a non - zero cavity decay rate .",
    "this population reduces the fidelity of the state mapping .",
    "the parameters are @xmath175 , where @xmath68  mhz.,width=302 ]    in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] we plot the population of state @xmath66 for quite large value of @xmath15 to show that this population reaches a local minimum periodically , but does not reach zero .",
    "we can infer two consequences from this .",
    "first , a very high fidelity is possible only for very small @xmath176 .",
    "second , although we can only approximate the operation @xmath25 , this approximation can be quite good if we use the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath172 to minimize it .",
    "it is interesting that the local minima of @xmath172 are almost independent of @xmath15 .",
    "so , to a good approximation , this population takes minimum values at @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a positive integer .",
    "second important difference in the operation @xmath25 between cases when the damping is present and when is not is the time of this operation . in order to get an approximated formula for the @xmath44 pulse ,",
    "we need further approximations . recalling that @xmath164 , we drop all small terms and as a result we eliminate the state @xmath66 from the evolution .",
    "expressions for amplitudes obtained in this way are less precise , but much simpler @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",

    "this @xmath44 pulse is close to be perfect when the population of the intermediate state takes minimum value at the end of this pulse .",
    "therefore , the time given by  ( [ eq : tka12 ] ) has to be equal to that given by  ( [ eq : dka01 ] ) .",
    "this is possible only for the fine tuned values of the detuning @xmath187 where @xmath188 is given by  ( [ eq : gen5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath44 pulse operation for non - zero @xmath15 can be approximated by @xmath189 and @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , after the second stage of the protocol the unnormalized state of the system is given by @xmath190 now it is useful to set @xmath191 , which satisfies the condition @xmath192",
    ". this leads to @xmath193 then at the end of the protocol we obtain @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the normalization factor . observe that for non - zero values of @xmath15 the state mapping is not perfect because of the damping factor @xmath196 .",
    "we can achieve high fidelity for small enough values of @xmath197 only .    using  ( [ eq : tka12 ] ) , ( [ eq : dka17 ] ) , ( [ eq : dka19 ] ) and  ( [ eq : stage210b ] ) we find that the minimal fidelity exceeds the value @xmath82 for @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "more considerable value of @xmath15 we can set for small values of @xmath154 , because then the @xmath44 pulse is faster and @xmath197 smaller . the formulas  ( [ eq : tka12 ] ) , ( [ eq : dka17 ] ) and  ( [ eq : dka19 ] ) work properly only when @xmath164 and @xmath201 .",

    "so far , we have assumed that spontaneous emission decay rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 are equal to zero .",
    "let us now relax this assumption and investigate the influence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 on state - mapping operations .",
    "it seems obvious that the fidelity of state mapping decreases with increasing @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "sometimes even a small value of the spontaneous decay rate can considerably decrease the fidelity or the success probability  @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be surprising that non - zero spontaneous emission decay rates can improve state - mapping operations .",
    "the reason is that field and atomic damping act in a sense in opposite directions .     as a function of time for the same parameters as in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , but for ( @xmath206 .",
    "for non - zero values of @xmath207 and @xmath208 this unwanted population again approaches zero periodically.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows that the periodic behaviour of the system lost due to non - zero @xmath15 can be partially recovered by non - zero @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the unwanted population of the state @xmath66 again approaches zero periodically .",
    "the same effect can be also observed in the @xmath0-type system  @xcite .",
    "this is one of rare examples of a decay process demonstrating its usefulness in quantum - state engineering .",
    "however , it should be noted that the atomic damping mechanism plays this constructive role only when we are able to distinguish and reject unsuccessful cases of state - mapping operations , where spontaneous emissions take place .",
    "fortunately , in v - type systems the quantum system is in the auxiliary level @xmath4 after spontaneous emission , and therefore , it is easy to check whether the spontaneous emission takes place or not .    the atomic damping is responsible for one more surprise  the v - type system can be better than the @xmath0-type system for the state mapping . the perfect @xmath44 pulse operation for non - zero @xmath15 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be approximated by @xmath209 and @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is an effective damping rate . if @xmath164 and @xmath201 then @xmath212 .",
    "in this case , at the end of the protocol the unnormalized state of the system is given by @xmath213 the normalized system state in the v - type system is given by @xmath214 while the normalized system state in the @xmath0-type system is almost independent of @xmath14 and can be well approximated by @xmath215 a comparison of  ( [ eq : gam02 ] ) with  ( [ eq : gam03 ] ) shows that the damping factor in the v - type system can be closer to one than the damping factor in the @xmath0-type system in the case of @xmath216 and large detunings .",
    "since the damping factor has significant influence on the fidelity for considerable values of @xmath15 , the fidelity of the state mapping in v - type systems is higher in this case than in @xmath0-type systems . in  ( [ eq : gam02 ] ) @xmath217 .",
    "now let us use atomic decay to increase @xmath15 in the state - mapping protocol without decreasing the fidelity .",
    "we want @xmath15 as large as possible because for real cavities it takes considerable values .",
    "the state - mapping protocol , for which the minimal fidelity exceeds @xmath82 , can be performed for @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "even larger value of @xmath15 can be set for small @xmath154 .",
    "using numerical calculations , we have found that @xmath202 for @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "it is worth to note that it is possible to set @xmath224 larger than @xmath225 with @xmath202 .",
    "the main obstacle to achieve such high fidelity for large cavity decay rates is the damping factor in  ( [ eq : gam02 ] ) .",
    "we can overcome this obstacle in the class of algorithms , in which the damping factor is compensated for  @xcite . in this way we can get @xmath202 for @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "a typical range of @xmath136 in quantum dot - cavity systems is @xmath229 to @xmath230  ghz  @xcite , so the coupling strength in quantum dot systems is three orders of magnitude larger than in atom - cavity systems .",
    "since the state - mapping protocol needs @xmath231 in the first stage , counter - rotating terms become important and can not be neglected .",
    "one can check using  ( [ eq : rwa02 ] ) that for the excitonic wavelength of  @xcite @xmath232  nm ( @xmath233  ghz ) there is no such @xmath129 that @xmath234 .",
    "( solid line ) and for considerable value of @xmath154 ( dotted line).,width=302 ]    it is seen in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] that for @xmath68  ghz and small value of the detuning @xmath156 ( @xmath155 ) we obtain the fidelity , which does not satisfy the requirement of large quantum algorithms , though it is still very high .",
    "fortunately , @xmath235 can be reduced also by increasing @xmath154 . from  ( [ eq : to01 ] ) it is seen that @xmath235 is proportional to @xmath236 , which tends to 0 as @xmath237 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows that for large enough @xmath154 it is possible to perform the state - mapping protocol with @xmath63 by setting moderate value of @xmath94 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath147 for @xmath68  ghz , @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( which lead to @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) .",
    "it is possible to satisfy the requirement of large quantum algorithms even in the presence of field and atomic damping .",
    "the state mapping with the minimal fidelity equal to @xmath243 can be performed for @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "it is worth to mention here that quantum optimal control theory  @xcite makes it possible to manipulate spins very fast and with high fidelity in two level systems beyond the rwa regime  @xcite .",
    "this is all what is needed in the first stage of the state - mapping protocol performed in quantum dot - cavity systems .",
    "therefore it is possible that the presented results may be improved by using optimal control theory .",
    "finally , we shortly discuss the realizability of the state - mapping protocol in a quantum system consisted of a quantum dot placed in a photonic crystal cavity , like in  @xcite . a neutral exciton @xmath247 eigenstates naturally form a three - level v - type system .",
    "let us set experimentally achievable coupling strength @xmath68  ghz and the exciton decay rate @xmath248 ( @xmath249 )  @xcite .",
    "let us also assume that the damping factor is compensated for .",
    "then we can obtain high fidelity @xmath250 for @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 . note that the protocol time is short compared with @xmath254 of  @xcite .",
    "however , the protocol time is comparable to @xmath255 of  @xcite , where @xmath256 is the exciton pure dephasing rate .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , the value of the cavity decay rate required by the protocol is demanding for present technology . in our numerical calculations",
    "we have chosen value @xmath257 , which is 40 times smaller than that of  @xcite .",
    "i have shown that v - type quantum systems consisting of an atom or atom - like structure and optical cavity have important drawback  quantum information stored in a superposition of two excited states can not be exactly mapped onto cavity mode state using a single rectangular laser pulse .",
    "the fidelity of such a state mapping is always reduced by the population of the intermediate ground state .",
    "however , i have found that there exists a two - stage state - mapping protocol for v - type systems , which performs the state - mapping operation almost perfectly , i.e. , the fidelity tends to unity with increasing the intensity of the laser light in the first stage of the protocol .",
    "since the first stage is ultra - short , this protocol is almost as fast as state mapping performed in @xmath0-type quantum systems .",
    "the protocol time is short compared with @xmath254 of  @xcite .",
    "i have also investigated the influence of field and atomic damping on this protocol .",
    "i have shown that the atomic decay can be useful in the state - mapping protocol  it can suppress unwanted effects of the cavity decay .",
    "the atomic decay partially recovers the periodic behaviour of the system and can make the damping factor close to one .",
    "surprisingly , in the limit of large detunings the state - mapping protocol for v - type systems can achieve higher fidelity than the state mapping for @xmath0-type systems due to the atomic damping ."
