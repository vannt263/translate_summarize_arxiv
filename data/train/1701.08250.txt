    "with the discovery of the new resonance of mass around 125 gev by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc in 2012 , a change of paradigm has taken @xcite .",
    "the discovery has unambiguously established the role of the higgs mechanism in electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "all the properties of the new particle measured so far are consistent with that of the standard higgs boson .",
    "thus , one may be tempted to conclude that for all practical purposes , the newly found particle is like that of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , and new physics effects are decoupled as far as the higgs sector is concerned . at the same time , it is well known that there are difficulties associated with the higgs sector of the sm that need to be addressed .",
    "the main difficulty is the hierarchy problem associated with the quadratically diverging quantum corrections to the mass of the higgs boson when computed in the sm .",
    "there is no remedy to this difficulty within the sm , and for a higgs boson of mass 125 gev , the new physics effects should show up within the tev range to cure this malady . assuming that the new physics effects are expected to appear only indirectly in the higgs sector , it is natural to consider these effects through effective couplings of the higgs bosons , with itself as well as with the gauge bosons and heavy fermions .",
    "precise measurement of these couplings is very essential to establish the true nature of the ewsb mechanism .",
    "while the lhc is capable of probing some of these couplings @xcite , especially the higgs couplings with the gauge bosons and top quark , one may need to rely on a cleaner machine like the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite for the required precision . within an effective lagrangian",
    ", the effect of new physics could be studied in the various couplings through the quantum corrections they acquire .",
    "such an effective lagrangian basically encodes the new physics effects in higher - dimensional operators with anomalous couplings .",
    "+ the study of the higgs sector through an effective lagrangian goes back to refs.@xcite .",
    "more recently , the lagrangian including a complete set of dimension - six operators was studied by refs .",
    "@xcite . for some of the recent references discussing the constraints on the anomalous couplings within different approaches ,",
    "please see refs .",
    "reference @xcite studied the @xmath6 , where @xmath7 associated production at the lhc and tevatron to discuss the bounds obtainable from the global fit to the presently available data , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite has discussed the constraint on the parameters coming from the lhc results as well as other precision data from lep , slc , and tevatron .",
    "experimental studies on the higgs couplings at the lhc are presented in , for example , refs . @xcite .",
    "+ the measurement of trilinear higgs couplings is best done through the process @xmath8 @xcite . at the same time , this process also depends on the higgs - gauge boson couplings , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which will affect the determination of the @xmath11 coupling . another process that could probe the @xmath11 couplings is @xmath12 following the @xmath13 fusion @xcite , which is also affected by the @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings . in a recent study @xcite , we investigated the effect of the @xmath16 coupling , where @xmath17 , in the extraction of the @xmath11 coupling , and found that a precise knowledge of the @xmath14 and @xmath9 couplings is necessary to derive information regarding the trilinear couplings . apart from this",
    ", an investigation of higgs - gauge boson couplings has been performed in the recent study of wwh production at ilc @xcite .",
    "the anomalous couplings like @xmath18 and @xmath19 has been studied @xcite in the process of @xmath20 .",
    "the table [ table : constraints ] contains obtained limits on coupling parameters in previous studies .",
    "+ the process @xmath21 is well suited to study the higgs to neutral gauge boson couplings @xcite .",
    "this process is influenced by the trilinear couplings like @xmath22 and @xmath23 which can contaminate the effects of @xmath9 couplings . in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on this process in some detail within the framework of the effective lagrangian .",
    "one goal of this study is to investigate cp - conserving higgs sector through higgs to gauge boson couplings and to understand the significance of other couplings in their measurement .",
    ".current 95% cl bounds ( 2nd column ) and future higgs factory 2@xmath24 exclusion sensitivities ( 3rd and 4th columns ) on the coefficients of dim.-6 operators that contribute to @xmath25 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc has confirmed the higgs mechanism as the way to have ewsb providing masses to the fundamental particles .",
    "the properties of the higgs boson measured by the lhc so far are consistent with the expectations of the sm .",
    "it is expected that the lhc would measure the mass , spin , and parity of this particle along with the standard decay widths somewhat precisely . on the other hand , details of the couplings like the trilinear and quartic self - couplings as well as the couplings with the gauge bosons",
    "are not expected to be measured precisely . at the same time , precise knowledge of these couplings is very important in reconstructing the ewsb mechanism . a precision machine like the ilc is expected to help in the precise measurement of these couplings . in this paper , the process @xmath0 , which is influenced by the higgs to gauge boson couplings , namely , @xmath26 and @xmath23 is considered .",
    "the reach of an ilc at @xmath27 gev with an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath1 in probing the different relevant parameters of the corresponding effective lagrangian is presented .",
    "the influence of the presence of other couplings in the probe of each of the couplings are studied .",
    "we observed that the study of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 planes show that the allowed region can be narrowed to a very small band .",
    "while this band is unaffected by the presence of @xmath31 , the effect is significant if @xmath32 .",
    "consideration of the angular distributions of the higgs boson ( @xmath33 ) , the z - boson ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the transverse momentum as well as energy distributions of the higgs boson , z - boson and photon have proved to provide a handle in distinguishing the presence of different scenarios of @xmath38 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "all other parameters have an indistinguishable effect on these distributions .",
    "the invariant mass distributions of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairs are also sensitive to some parameters related to anomalous couplings . a quantitative estimate of the forward - backward asymmetry corresponding to the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath43 as well as z and@xmath42",
    "show that large deviations of up to 77% are possible for moderate values of the couplings . in all cases ,",
    "a suitably chosen beam polarization is found to be advantageous , as illustrated with an 80% left - polarized electron beam and a 30% right - polarized positron beam .",
    "the statistics can be improved by a factor of 1.5 with the baseline polarization quoted above , which can be improved to an enhancement factor of 1.7 with the expected 60% positron beam polarization in the upgraded version of the ilc .",
    "apart from the overall normalizing factor , some details are also affected , as is illustrated in the improvements in the forward - backward asymmetry , when beam polarization is used .",
    "thus , the study shows that @xmath44 production at the ilc is useful in detecting the anomalous couplings in higgs - gauge boson interactions . a detailed analysis involving standard kinematic distributions",
    "could be used to distinguish different scenarios involving the couplings .",
    "while the numerical study needs to be improved with more realistic collider and detector information , as well as study of the background processes , we hope to have conveyed the importance of the process in determining and disentangling the effects of anomalous higgs - gauge boson couplings . + * acknowledgements * sk would like to acknowledge the financial support from the serb - dst , india , under the national post - doctoral fellowship programme , grant no .",
    "pdf/2015/000167 and the iit - gandhinagar during the initial stages of the project .",
    "we thank b. coleppa and p. poulose for useful discussions .",
    "* a. * the most general formula for the matrix element square for arbitrary polarized @xmath45 beams is given in refs.@xcite .",
    "if one considers massless electron and positron , the final formula is reduced to the following form @xcite ,      where @xmath47 is the helicity amplitude for the process under consideration , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the helicities of the electron and positron respectively .",
