    "in condensed matter physics quantum phases and associated strongly correlated many body states are typically prepared by cooling the system to low temperatures , where its properties are dominated by the ground state of a hamiltonian , @xmath0 , i.e. by considering a _ thermodynamic equilibrium _",
    "situation , where @xmath1 for temperature @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , in the context of ultracold atomic quantum gases , much of the interest of the last few years has focused on _ engineering _ _ specific hamiltonians _ based on control of microscopic system parameters via external fields @xcite , opening the door to a quantum simulation of strongly correlated ground states @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum optics typically considers driven open quantum system , where a system of interest is driven by an external field and coupled to an environment inducing a _ non - equilibrium _ dynamics , with time evolution described by a master equation for the reduced system density operator ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath3+{\\cal l}\\rho\\label{eq : masterequation}\\\\ & \\equiv & -i[h,\\rho]+\\sum_{\\ell}\\kappa_{\\ell}\\left(2c_{\\ell}\\rho c_{\\ell}^{\\dagger}-c_{\\ell}^{\\dagger}c_{\\ell}\\rho-\\rho c_{\\ell}^{\\dagger}c_{\\ell}\\right).\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the driven system , while the liouvillian @xmath5 in lindblad form represents the dissipative terms .",
    "the _ quantum jump operators _ @xmath6 are system operators as they appear in the interaction hamiltonian for the coupling to the bath of harmonic oscillators , and describe the time evolution ( quantum jump ) of the system associated with the emission of a quantum into the harmonic oscillator bath with rate @xmath7 in channel @xmath8 .",
    "the validity of the master equation is based on the born - markov approximation with system - bath coupling in rotating wave approximation , which in quantum optics is an excellent approximation because the ( optical ) system frequencies are much larger than the decay rates . for long times , the system described by ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) will approach a dynamical steady state , @xmath9 , which in general will be a mixed state .",
    "however , under special circumstances the steady state can be a _ pure state , _",
    "@xmath10 , where in the language of quantum optics @xmath11 is called a _",
    "dark state_. sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique dark state are ( i ) @xmath12 @xmath13 , i.e. the dark state is an eigenstate of the set of quantum jump operators with zero eigenvalue , which will be compatible with the dynamics induced by the hamiltonian if ( ii ) @xmath14 . uniqueness of the dark state is guaranteed if there is no other subspace of the system hilbert space which is invariant under the action of the operators @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that for any given pure state there will be a master equation so that this state becomes the unique steady state @xcite .    here , we are interested in this novel possibility of quantum state engineering by designing jump operators such that one drives the system into a desired many - body quantum state .",
    "this _ non - equilibrium _ approach is in strong contrast to conventional hamiltonian engineering methods , as standard thermodynamics concepts are not valid in this driven system , and the dynamics goverened by the master equation ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) is the only remaining principle determining the final state . while in quantum optics we know several examples of preparing _ single particle _ pure states dissipation , including dark state laser cooling to subrecoil temperatures @xcite , it is of interest to extend these ideas to many body systems , dissipatively driving the system into entangled states of interest , or preparing non - equilibrium quantum phases in condensed matter systems .",
    "furthermore , for the example of a dissipative driven bose einstein condensate ( bec ) discussed below , but also for stabilizer states in a system of spins-@xmath15 or qubits living on a lattice @xcite , the dissipation can be chosen to be quasi ",
    "local , i.e. the jump operators act non  trivially only on a small neighborhood of particles .    as an illustration of a many particle dark state",
    ", we discuss below a dissipatively driven bec , where for non - interacting atoms a pure state exhibiting long range order is generated as the steady state by quasi - local coupling to an environment with finite correlation length .",
    "applying standard linearization schemes in the weakly interacting situations , allows us to determine the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) , and we find that the steady state exhibits similar properties as bosons in thermal contact to a heat bath : in 3d the effect of the interaction can be understood in terms of a depletion of the condensate , while in 1d and 2d the system exhibits properties reminiscent of a luttinger liquid or a kosterlitz - thouless critical phase at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , we give a physical realization in terms of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice by immersion in a superfluid bath @xcite . as a second example we discuss a master equation whose steady state corresponds to an @xmath16-condensate @xcite , i.e. a state of long range order of paired fermions , which remarkably corresponds to an _ exact _ _ excited _ eigenstate of a hubbard hamiltonian with repulsive or attractive interactions in @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of @xmath18 bosonic atoms on @xmath17-dimensional lattice with @xmath19 lattice sites , lattice vectors @xmath20 and spacing @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "we assume that the coherent motion of the atoms can be described a single band hubbard model with hamiltonian@xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the kinetic energy of bosons hopping between adjacent lattice sites with amplitude @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the onsite interactions with strength @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are bosonic destruction ( creation ) operators for atoms at site @xmath29 .",
    "a physical realization of this situation is achieved by loading cold bosonic atoms into an optical lattice . by cooling to temperatures @xmath2",
    "the system is prepared in the groundstate , which for noninteracting atoms is @xmath30 which corresponds to a state with macroscopic occupation of the quasimomentum @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the destruction operator for quasimomentum @xmath33 in the bloch band .",
    "for weak interactions we have in 3d a bec , and a quasi - condensate in 1d and 2d , while with increasing interactions the system can undergo a quantum phase transition to a mott phase @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we are interested here in a _ dissipative _ hubbard dynamics modelled by a master equation ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) . in atomic physics",
    "a bath will typically couple to the atoms via the atomic density , @xmath34 , as in the case of decoherence due to spontaneous emission in an optical lattice , or for collisional interactions .",
    "this will tend to dephase the condensate , and can heat the system .",
    "in contrast , our goal is to couple the system to a bath so that the system is driven to a pure many body state by quasi - local dissipation .",
    "this is achieved , for example , by chosing jump operators @xmath35 acting between a pair of adjacent lattice sites @xmath36 with a dissipative rate @xmath37 it is then easy to see that the state @xmath38 satisfies ( i ) @xmath39 @xmath40 , and ( ii ) is an eigenstate of the kinetic energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the single particle bloch energy for quasimomentum @xmath33 . in other words , @xmath38 is a many body dark state corresponding to a state of long range order for non - interacting bosons on the lattice . in fact ( see appendix a ) , this state is the unique steady state of this master equation , and any initial mixed state will evolve for long times into @xmath38 .",
    "the key in obtaining a state of long range order as the steady state is to couple to the bath involving the atomic current operator between two adjacent lattice sites ; the concept that dissipative coupling to the current operator stabilizes superconductivity is well knwon in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the jump operator @xmath43 describes a pumping process where the second factor @xmath44 annihilates the anti - symmetric ( out - phase ) superposition on the pair of sites @xmath45 , while @xmath46 recycles the atoms into the symmetric ( in - phase ) state . loosely speaking",
    ", we can interpret this process as a dissipative locking of the atomic phases of two adjacent lattice sites , which in turn results in a global phase locking , i.e. a condensate .",
    "note that in view of @xmath47 it is the destruction part of the jump operator which makes @xmath38 the dark state , while any linear combination @xmath28 and @xmath48 of recycling operators will do , except for a hermitian @xmath43 which would lead to a pure dephasing but no pumping into the dark state .    the above discussion becomes particularly clear in a momentum representation suggested by the translation invariance . the dissipative part of the master equation takes on the form ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) with jump operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which makes the appearance of the dark state @xmath31 decoupled from dissipation particulary apparent .",

    "the above master equation can be realized by immersing atoms @xmath21 moving in an optical lattice in a large bec of atoms @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the condensate interacts in the form of a contact potential with interspecies scattering length @xmath58 with the atoms @xmath21 , and acts as a bath of bogoliubov excitations .",
    "this coupling provides an efficient mechanism for decay of atoms @xmath21 from an excited to lower bloch bands by emission of a bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
    "atoms @xmath21 moving in the lowest bloch band can be driven by laser induced raman processes to the first excited bloch band , and can decay back to the ground band .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of optical pumping in quantum optics , or laser cooling @xcite .",
    "there a laser excites electronic states of an atom , which return to the ground state by spontaneous emission of a photon .",
    "this formal analogy suggests and justifies a description of a driven dissipative hubbard dynamics in terms of a master equation .",

    "spontaneous emission is either correlated or uncorrelated .",
    "however complicated @xmath66 , the existence of a dark state is guaranteed by @xmath47 , a property which follows from the laser excitation step .",
    "we will confine our discussion below to the master equation with jump operators ( [ eq : jump ] ) with qualitatively similar results expected for the general case .",
    "for a realistic system with a finite interaction @xmath25 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) , the @xmath70 is no longer a dark state of the master equation : the interactions tend to localize the particles , while the dissipative terms tend to enforce a pure condensate . in general , the competition between these two incompatible dynamics results in a mixed state .",
    "below we present linearized theories , which allow us to solve for the density matrix @xmath71 , as well as to study the correlations functions under the time evolution .      for weak interactions , one can expect that the pure @xmath72 state is only weakly perturbed with the zero momentum mode @xmath73 still macroscopically occupied .",
    "we follow therefore the standard bogoliubov prescription and replace in the master equation the zero momentum mode by its mean value , i.e. , @xmath74 with @xmath75 the condensate density ( @xmath76 ) . in leading order ,",

    "note that @xmath84 and the summation over the index @xmath8 avoids these double countings .",
    "it follows that the master equation decouples for each mode @xmath85 and is quadratic in the bosonic operators . the analogous master equation in quantum optics is well known from parametric amplification .",
    "the general solution is given by a mixed gaussian state , which in steady state takes the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 with @xmath88 describing a finite occupation of the squeezed operators @xmath89 .",
    "the squeezing parameter @xmath90 and @xmath88 are given by the relation @xmath91 with @xmath92 the bogoliubov energy .",

    "we recover the pure @xmath72 in the limit of vanishing interactions @xmath94 . on the other hand for fixed interaction and dissipation @xmath95 , the modes @xmath96",
    "essentially reduce to the well known bogoliubov modes for small momentum @xmath97 , while the parameter takes the form @xmath98 with an effective temperature @xmath99 the density matrix for the low momentum modes is therefore indistinguishable from the thermal state of a weakly interacting bose gas with the role of a `` finite temperature '' played by the interactions @xmath100 .",
    "this similarity of the driven system with a thermal bogoliubov state naturally rises the question on the validity of the mean field approximation : the ansatz assumes a small depletion @xmath101 of the zero momentum mode . using the above solution for the steady state",
    ", the condensate depletion takes the from @xmath102 with @xmath103 the volume of the brillouin zone .",
    "this expression strongly depends on the dimension of the system : in 3d the depletion remains finite and small for weak interactions @xmath104 . on the other hand , in one- and two - dimensions an infrared divergence appears indicating the absence of a macroscopic occupation and the breakdown of mean - field theory .",
    "consequently , we find that a dissipatively driven system exhibits the same behavior as a bosonic system in themal contact with a heat bath , where the appearance of long - range order at finite temperature is only possible above the lower critical dimension d=2 .",
    "the solution to the master equation also allows us to study the relaxation into the steady state , see appendix c. the build up of the macroscopic occupation @xmath105 obeys the long time behavior @xmath106 the condensate @xmath105 approaches the steady state according to a power law . in the strict absence of interactions",
    "the behavior is modified to @xmath107 .",
    "the slower approach to equilibrium for the interacting system results from the scrambling of the particles via the interaction .      in lower dimensions ,",
    "the interaction drives strong phase fluctuations , which destroy the macroscopic occupation of the condensate .",
    "however , these fluctuations are only relevant on distances larger than the coherence length @xmath109 ( @xmath21 denotes the lattice spacing ) .",
    "consequently , the formation of a local condensate still takes place on shorter distances , while only the phase between these local condensates is destroyed by the fluctations .",

    "this behavior of the dissipatively driven system is in close analogy to the thermodynamics of interacting bosons giving rise to kosterlitz - thouless critical phases in 2d , and luttinger liquids in 1d .",
    "the jump operators simplify to @xmath113 while the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) reduces to the harmonic model @xmath114 consequently , the master equation becomes again quadratic and introducing new bosonic operators @xmath115 with @xmath116 allows us to decouple the master equation for each mode @xmath8 : we define the bosonic operator @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "surprisingly , with this definition the jump operator reduces to @xmath119 and the master equation ( [ eq : masterequation ] ) in the long wave length limit @xmath120 is mapped to the same form as the master equation in the previous section , with the operator @xmath85 replaced by the new operator @xmath115 and the chemical potential @xmath100 replaced by @xmath121 .",
    "consequently , we find again the exact solution to the master equation , which allows us to characterize the state via its correlation functions , see appendix c ; such a characterization of a states in cold gases has attracted a lot of interest recently @xcite .",

    "then , simple analytic results are found in 2d ( with the help of the quantum regression theorem ) giving rise to quasi long - range order @xmath127 with the kosterlitz - thouless temperature @xmath128 , and the short distances scales @xmath129 and @xmath130 . on the other hand , in one - dimension we find an exponential decay both in space and time with coherence length @xmath131 , with the parameter @xmath132 playing the role of the luttinger parameter .",
    "the concept of the effective temperature is particularly efficient in the low dimensional systems , where the correlations are dominated by the low energy phase modes , as implied by the exponential ( 1d ) and algebraic decay ( 2d ) .",
    "noticeably , the functional dependence of the correlation function is determined by the ratio @xmath133 alone , while the dissipative coupling strength @xmath95 only gives rise to non - universal prefactors .",
