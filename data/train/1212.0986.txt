    "the magnetic potential due to the ferromagnetic order , does obviously not exhibit a step - like increase right at the ybco / lcmo interface or a corresponding decrease at the lcmo / ybco interfaces .",

    "+   + model 2 describes the inverse magnetic proximity effect , where fm moments antiparallel to the mn moments in lcmo are induced on the ybco side of the interface . in the first place",
    ", one expects that these are the cu moments which have been observed with the xmcd and xrmr measurements .",
    "however , the magnitude of these ferromagnetic cu moments is reported to be only  @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it remains to be seen whether they can account for the observed large increase of the intensity of the even order bragg peaks .",
    "on the other hand , we can not completely exclude the possibility that an additional , possibly even larger contribution arises from some mn ions that may have been incorporated in the ybco layers , for example due to an unwanted contamination or a diffusion across the interface during the growth .",
    "+   + model 3 accounts for a similar case where the induced fm moment on the ybco side is parallel to the one of the mn moments in lcmo and to the applied magnetic field .",
    "such a contribution would have to arise solely from the mn moments , since the xmcd and xrmr data clearly established the antiparallel orientation of the cu moments . +   + for all three models we had to use a modified magnetic potential for the topmost lcmo layer , i.e.",
    ", a 2 - 3 nm thick non - magnetic layer has been introduced at the film surface .",
    "this was necessary to reproduce the sizable differences between the @xmath32 and @xmath33 curves in the region right before and after the 1st order slbp .",
    "we suspect that this effect arises from the interaction of the surface layer with the ambient which degrades the fm order in the first few lcmo monolayers . +   + in the following we use the quality of the best fits as the criterion to determine the validity of each model .",
    "in addition , we compare the average value of the magnetization obtained from the model with the experimental result as measured with dc magnetization . +   + figs .",
    "[ sadam ] and  [ nrex ] show the pnr curves at 100k , 10k and 4k with the best fits for each model ( solid lines ) together with the obtained depth profiles of the nuclear and magnetic scattering length densities .",
    "as was already mentioned , the structural parameters have been constrained to lie within the error bars of the parameters derived from the unpolarized room temperature curves .",
    "the obtained reduced likelihood estimators for models 1 , 2 and 3 of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , are in favor of model 1 .",
    "the specific features where models 2 and 3 fail to describe the experimental data are discussed next . +   + the close - ups in figs .  [",
    "sadam](h ) and  [ nrex](h ) reveal that model 3 predicts a shift in the position of the 2nd order slbp towards lower ( higher ) @xmath24 for the @xmath33 ( @xmath32 ) curve .",
    "such a shift is not observed in the experimental data where the maxima nearly coincide and the splitting of the curves is due to the different intensities of the peaks .",
    "the disagreement is especially obvious on the high @xmath24 side of the 2nd order slbp where the intensity of the fitted @xmath32 curve is higher than for the corresponding @xmath33 curve , whereas in the experimental data the opposite trend is observed .",
    "such a discrepancy was already noted in ref . and",
    "was used to discard model 3 .",
    "furthermore , we note that a rather large value of the induced magnetization in the ybco layers has to be assumed for model 3 to account for the large intensity of the 2nd order slbp . for the fits in figs  [ sadam ] and  [ nrex ] the fm moment in the ybco layer has been constrained to have the same value as the one in the lcmo layers .",
    "when it was released , the induced magnetization reached even larger values whereas the quality of the fit was not significantly improved .",
    "already the constrained value appears to be unreasonably large , e.g. for the pnr curves taken at 4koe it reaches @xmath38 .",
    "such a large ferromagnetic moment on the ybco side of the interface can not arise from the induced cu moments , it would also require an unrealistically large concentration of mn ions . +   + for model 2 , as shown in the close - ups in figs  [ sadam](e ) and  [ nrex](e ) , can account reasonably well for the data in the vicinity of the 2nd order slbp .",
    "nevertheless , it largely overestimates the intensity of the 3rd order slbp in the @xmath33 curve .",
    "the intensity of the 3rd slbp in the simulation could be reduced assuming an increased roughness of the magnetic potential .",
    "however , this would lead to a faster decay of the curve to the background level which is not observed .",
    "it would also further enhance the discrepancy at the 4th order slbp where the fit already severely underestimates the peak intensity of the @xmath33 curve .",
    "furthermore , model 2 has the same problem as model 3 concerning the very large value of the induced moment in the ybco layers that has to be assumed .",
    "once more , for the fit in figs  [ sadam](d ) and  [ nrex](d ) the fm moment in the ybco layer has been constrained to be the same as the one in the lcmo layers , i.e. at 4 koe it reaches @xmath38 .",
    "this value is larger than the moment of @xmath39 of cu@xmath40 and one order of magnitude larger than the value reported from the xmcd measurements , @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "if the induced magnetic moment is for example bounded to @xmath41 , the intensity of the 2nd slbp is largely reduced and the overall quality of the fit is strongly reduced .",
    "+   + model 1 is clearly the one that reproduces the measured data the best and yields a realistic magnitude of the ferromagnetic moments . the position , spin splitting , and intensity of all slbps are reasonably well described .",
    "only the overestimation of the intensity of the 4th order slbp in the @xmath32 curve at nrex can be regarded as a significant mismatch between the simulation and the data .",
    "the very fact that such a simple block - like model reproduces all features of the measurement is remarkable and confirms that it contains the main characteristics of the magnetic depth profile of the sl .",
    "these simulations clearly establish the trend that a sizable suppression of the fm moment on the lcmo side of the interface is responsible for the occurrence of the even order slbps .",
    "the characteristic length of the decay of the ferromagnetic moment at the interface should therefore be directly related to the calculated thickness of the depleted layers which are shown in table  [ depl ] for the different temperatures and fields .",
    "+   + it appears that the thickness of the depleted layer is consistently larger for the bottom interface than for the one on top of the lcmo layer ( in terms of the sl growth direction ) .",
    "the origin of this difference between the two interfaces is not known .",
    "it may be related to a structural difference that is imposed by a different growth process . however",
    ", a recent transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) study on superlattices that were grown under identical conditions did not show any clear indication of such a difference  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , but in good agreement with a previous study of similar superlattices on sto substrates  @xcite , the tem images suggest that both the ybco / lcmo and the lcmo / ybco interfaces involve the same kind of cuo@xmath42-y - cuo@xmath42-bao - mno@xmath42 layer stacking sequence for which the last ybco unit cell is lacking its cuo chains",
    ". the expected asymmetry of the interfaces , where a cuo chain layer should be adjacent to one of the interfaces and a cuo@xmath42 bilayer to the other one , could not be observed .",
    "this still leaves the possibility that the layer separating the cuo@xmath42 and mno@xmath42 planes may have a different stoichiometry , i.e. it may have a variable ba and la or ca content .",
    "+   +    , width=325 ]    to obtain further information about the magnetic nature of the depleted layers , we have modified the fitting with model 1 by allowing for a finite magnitude of the fm moments in the depleted layer ( treating the net magnetization in the depleted layers as a fitting parameter ) . to keep the number of fitting parameters reasonably low ,",
    "we have now set the thickness of the depleted layers for the top and bottom interfaces to be common for all temperatures and fields .",
    "this modification is labeled as model 1a and the comparison of the fitted curves using this model and the pnr data at 4koe data is shown in fig .",
    "[ model1a ] .",
    "the inset shows the obtained depth profile of the scattering length densities , for which the magnetic part is proportional to the fm moment . in agreement with the results obtained for model 1 , shown in table  [ depl ] , the thicknesses of the top and bottom depleted layers",
    "are calculated as 9.2(7) and 20.1(7) , respectively .",
    "it appears that the best fit obtained with model 1a is indeed very similar to the one of model 1  ( see fig .",
    "[ nrex ] ) and results in the same value of the reduced likelihood estimator of @xmath43 .",
    "the fit with model 1a yields a finite magnetic scattering length density near the bottom interface corresponding to a fm moment of about 20 percent of the one in the central part of the lcmo layers .",
    "this value increases somewhat as the temperature is reduced from 100k to 4k , in good agreement with model 1 where a corresponding decrease of the depleted layer thickness was obtained . near the top interface",
    "the fit with model 1a does not yield a finite value of the fm moment . nevertheless , given the crude assumption of block - like magnetic potentials ,",
    "we are not sure whether these fits results are significant .",
    "therefore we can not draw any firm conclusion about presence of a small ferromagnetic moment in the depleted layers .",
    "+   + as a next step , we have addressed the question whether the induced ferromagnetic cu moment in the ybco layers are playing a significant role for the fitting of the pnr curves .",
    "the presence of these cu moments was confirmed by the xmcd and xrmr measurements which suggest an average fm moment of 0.25@xmath44 per cu ion that is antiparallel to the applied field and the moments in lcmo  @xcite . we have therefore modified model 1 to allow in addition to the depleted layers on the lcmo side for a small , antiparallel moment on the ybco side .",
    "it turned out that these cu moments do not significantly modify or improve the fit results .",
    "this is not surprising since these cu moments are about ten times smaller than the mn moments in the central part of the lcmo layers and so are the corresponding value of the magnetic potential and the magnetic scattering length density .",
    "the reflectivity curves are governed by the larger magnetic moments inside the lcmo layers and within the sensitivity of our pnr measurements we can not make any quantitative statements regarding the induced cu moment in the ybco layers .",

    "this comparison shows a very good agreement for models 1 and 1a and large discrepancies for models 2 and 3 . for model 3 where the fm moments in the lcmo and ybco layers are assumed to be parallel , the calculated magnetic moment is almost twice as large as the measured one . for model 2",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are significantly smaller than the measured ones .",
    "evidently , this is the consequence of the assumption that the fm moment in the ybco layers is antiparallel to the ones in the lcmo layers .",

    "given the simplicity of the model , with its simple block like potentials , this agreement can be considered as excellent .",
    "the somewhat larger difference that appears in the low field data at 100oe , where the magnetization is not yet fully saturated , may have its origin in a weak spin flip scattering which would contribute to both spin channels , especially around the 1st bragg peak , and thus enhance the calculated magnetic moment .    , width=325 ]     +   + to conclude , the analysis of the pnr data as shown above provides clear evidence for the presence of a so - called depleted layer on the lcmo side of the interfaces in which the ferromagnetic moment of the mn ions is strongly suppressed as compared to the central part of the lcmo layers .",

    "interfaces it remains almost constant , whereas at the bottom interfaces it decreases considerably toward low temperature . as reported in ref .",
    ", this decrease is even anomalously enhanced below the superconducting transition temperature . additional evidence for an intrinsic electronic origin of the depleted layers in the ybco / lcmo sl comes from the observation that the magnetic proximity effect and thus these depleted layers are absent for a corresponding ybco / lamno@xmath46 sl for which the manganite layers are insulating  @xcite .",
    "the large fm moments of the mn ions persist here right up to the interface .",
    "furthermore , there is the observation of the xmcd and xrmr studies that a ferromagnetic ( or strongly canted antiferromagnetic ) order of the cu moments is induced on the ybco side of the interfaces of the ybco / lcmo sl .",
    "notably , these cu moments are much weaker or even absent in the ybco / lmo sls where the fm order of the mn moments persists right up to the interface .",
    "these observations suggest that the induced ferromagnetic cu moments in the ybco layers are a central part of the magnetic proximity effect just as much as the suppression of the fm moment on the lcmo side of the interface .",
    "the apparent antiparallel coupling between the induced cu moments in the ybco layers and the mn moments therefore requires that the depleted layer maintains some kind of magnetic order .",
    "likely , this involves a non - collinear magnetic order that can not be detected with the pnr technique which probes the average fm component .",
    "+   + finally , we note that such a non - collinear magnetic order may have important consequences for the superconducting proximity effect in these ybco / lcmo superlattices .",
    "it was previously shown that it can induce a spin - triplet component of the superconducting order parameter which has a long - ranged proximity effect into the fm layers  @xcite .",

    "<S> we emphasize that the ferromagnetic moment of these cu moments is apparently induced by the coupling to the mn moments suggesting that the depleted layer can not be a so - called dead  layer that is entirely not magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the observed strong suppression of the ferromagnetic moment in the depleted layer thus may be related to a canted antiferromagnetic or an oscillatory type of ordering of the mn moments that is not detected with the pnr technique .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the competing superconducting ( sc ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) order parameters is a fascinating topic that has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> significant progress has been made with thin - film heterostructures from conventional superconductors and elemental or alloy ferromagnets where effects such as domain wall superconductivity  @xcite , critical temperature oscillations with the thickness of the fm layer in sc / fm / sc junctions  @xcite and a long - range proximity effect of a spin - triplet sc state through composite fm layers with a non - collinear magnetic order  @xcite , were predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these developments have inspired concepts for a new kinds of spintronic devices and applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +   + driven by curiosity and encouraged by the potential for applications , researchers have also started to investigate heterostructures involving high-@xmath6 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) and ferromagnetic manganites  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the common perovskite - related structure and similar in - plane lattice parameters , together with recent improvements in film deposition techniques , enable the layer by layer controlled epitaxial growth of multilayers and superlattices ( sls ) with very sharp interfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on this kind of oxide sc / fm heterostructures revealed effects such as a change in the sc critical temperature , @xmath6 , related to the presence and thickness of the fm layers , and vice - versa  @xcite ; a sc related giant magneto - resistance in fm / sc / fm trilayers  @xcite ; the enhancement of @xmath6 by an external magnetic field  @xcite and even a sc induced modulation of the magnetic moment in the fm layers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide encouraging evidence for a sizable interaction between the sc and fm order parameters in these cuprate / manganite multilayer systems . </S>",
    "<S> they also show that not only the superconducting but also the magnetic properties of these oxide heterostructures are extremely versatile and need to be thoroughly investigated . </S>",
    "<S> +   + polarized neutron reflectometry ( pnr ) measurements on @xmath7/@xmath8 ( ybco / lcmo ) sls have indeed revealed an unusual kind of magnetic proximity effect that gives rise to a significant change of the fm order in the vicinity of the ybco / lcmo interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> pnr measurements on sls with equally thick ybco and lcmo layers , for which the even order superlattice bragg - peaks should be absent for symmetry reasons , showed that a 2nd order bragg peak appears and gains considerable intensity below the fm transition , @xmath9 , of the lcmo layers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation clearly showed that the depth profile of the magnetic potential has a lower local symmetry than the nuclear one . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the fm moment is either significantly modified ( reduced ) on the lcmo side of the interface or a fm moment is induced on the ybco side . </S>",
    "<S> two different models were proposed in ref .   to describe this magnetic proximity effect : a so - called dead layer model with a strongly reduced magnetization on the lcmo side , and a so - called inverse proximity effect model where ferromagnetic cu moments antiparallel to the mn moments in lcmo </S>",
    "<S> are induced on the ybco side of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> it was not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities since the pnr data contained only a fairly limited range in momentum space such that the superlattice bragg peaks beyond the 2nd order were not observed . </S>",
    "<S> later on , it was found that this is due to a problem of the srtio@xmath4 ( sto ) substrates for which a structural transition below 100 k can give rise to a buckling of the surface with micrometer - sized structural domains that are tilted up to 0.5 degree  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that this tilting extends into the sl on top of the sto substrate and thus gives rise to a large broadening or even a well pronounced splitting of the pnr specular signal along the 2@xmath10 direction of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> +   + in the meantime , i.e. before this problem with the sto substrates had been fully appreciated , additional experiments of ybco / lcmo sls on sto substrates were reported that supported either the dead layer model or the inverse proximity effect model . </S>",
    "<S> hoffmann et al . </S>",
    "<S> reported an enhancement in the mn  3@xmath11 occupation next to the interface and concluded that their pnr data support the dead layer model  @xcite . on the other hand , chakhalian et al . </S>",
    "<S> reported x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) data which established the presence of a ferromagnetic cu moment and thus were interpreted in terms of the inverse proximity effect model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> seemingly contradictory results were also reported concerning theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the density functional theory calculations performed by luo et al . predicted a strongly reduced ferromagnetic or even antiferromagnetic coupling for the mn atoms next to the interfaces  @xcite , whereas the theoretical work of salafranca et al . concluded that the negative spin polarization of cu in ybco layers is a key ingredient to explain the observed enhancement of @xmath6 with magnetic field observed in lcmo / ybco / lcmo trilayers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +   + more recently , some of the present authors have been shedding new light on this seemingly contradictory issue of the magnetic proximity effect . </S>",
    "<S> they investigated a ybco / lcmo sl on a @xmath3 ( lsat ) substrate which is well lattice - matched and avoids the complications of the buckling of the sto substrates @xcite . on this sl </S>",
    "<S> they performed a combination of pnr , xmcd and x - ray resonant magnetic reflectometry ( xrmr ) which showed that the magnetic proximity effect at the ybco / lcmo interface involves in fact both effects , i.e. a suppression of the fm moment on the lcmo side and , yet , an induced ferromagnetic cu moment on the ybco side . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was firmly established by the xmcd and especially by the xrmr measurements at the cu - l edge which confirmed that the ferromagnetic cu moments reside within the ybco layers . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , they demonstrated that the ferromagnetic cu moments do not arise from a small amount of cu ions that might have been incorporated in the lcmo layers . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a layer with a depleted fm moment on the lcmo side was inferred from the analysis of the pnr data which extend with a sufficient signal - to - noise - ratio to the 4th order superlattice bragg peak . in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> we present the details of the analysis of these pnr data which could not be shown in the previous short letter . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that the dead layer model , or rather the depleted layer model as we prefer to call it for the reasons given below , accounts very well for the pnr data . we also show that alternative models fail to reproduce important features of the pnr curves . </S>",
    "<S> +   + we remark that this observation has important implications . </S>",
    "<S> in combination with the xmcd and xrmr data , which reveal the existence of an induced fm cu moment on the ybco side of the interface , it suggests that a strongly reduced but finite fm order or possibly even a non - collinear magnetic order of the mn moments persists in the depleted layer which mediates the antiparallel coupling between the cu moments in ybco and the mn moments in the central part of the lcmo layers . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called depleted layer therefore should not be considered as a magnetically dead layer , instead it seems very much alive and may play an important role , for example , in the recently reported long - range sc proximity effect@xcite . </S>"
