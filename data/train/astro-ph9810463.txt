    "is a bright persistent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located in the globular cluster terzan 2 @xcite .",
    "terzan 2 is a metal - rich globular cluster of the galactic bulge with a reddening e(b - v)=1.57 @xcite .",
    "depending on the relation r=@xmath6 , ortolani et al .",
    "@xcite estimated a distance of 7.7 kpc for the `` canonical '' value of 3.1 for r @xcite , and d=5.3 kpc for r=3.6 @xcite respectively .",
    "the type i x - ray bursts observed from  indicate that the compact object is a weakly magnetized neutron star @xcite .",
    "analysis of these bursts , in particular the one observed by einstein that showed photospheric radius expansion , and therefore likely reached the eddington limit , places the source at a distance of 7 kpc @xcite , consistent with the estimate for r=3.1 .",
    "recent monitoring of the source , by the all sky monitor aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite , as well as snapshot observations performed earlier , indicate that  is weakly variable in x - rays ( less than about a factor of 3 on a few day time scale ) with a mean flux level of 45 mcrab in the 2 - 12 kev range .    prior to asca ,",
    "exosat , ttm and rosat x - ray observations ( @xmath7 1 - 20 kev ) have shown that the source spectrum could be simply fit by a power law of photon index @xmath8 @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "is one of the first neutron star systems from which hard x - ray emission ( e@xmath935 kev ) was discovered @xcite .",
    "additional observations of the source with sigma demonstrated that  was a persistent , though variable , hard x - ray source emitting at the mean level of 22 mcrab in the 35 - 75 kev range @xcite .",
    "fitting of the time - averaged sigma spectrum yields a photon index of @xmath10 for a power law fit , thus suggesting the existence of a cutoff or a break between the x - ray and hard x - ray bands @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our observation provides the most accurate  estimate obtained so far ( see fig .",
    "[ contours ] ) .",
    "our values are consistent with the one derived by sax @xcite . following predehl and schmitt @xcite , the visual extinction is related to the x - ray absorbing column density as = @xmath11 . taking e(b - v)=1.54 @xcite , we obtain = @xmath12 and @xmath13  for r=3.1 and 3.6 respectively .",
    "the `` optical '' value is remarkably close to the value derived with the + bb model ( see table 2 ) . it is smaller by than the value derived for the + dbb model ( the systematic difference in the  value between the bb and dbb models is due to the fact that the dbb is steeper than the bb model at low energies ) . in any case , the difference between the observed and expected , and the consistency between the sax , rxte values suggest that the source does not show intrinsic ( and variable ) absorption , as one might have suspected from previous measurements ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the larger  observed by ttm and at a lower degree by exosat might result from an overestimate of the photon index for a power law fit .",
    "we now know from sax , rxte and the present data ( all of which were in a very similar spectral state ) that the photon index is less than 2 for a power law fit .",
    "our results , which show agreement between the `` optical ''  and the x - ray  values , therefore eliminate the need for internal absorption in the source and therefore , any dependence upon the metallicity of terzan 2 ( which happens to be metal rich ) .",
    "consistent with the sax / lecs - mecs observations , asca failed to detect any emission lines from .",
    "for instance , an iron line and a broad absorption feature above 10 kev were detected from the x - ray burster 4u1608 - 522 by ginga , and interpreted as due to absorption / reflection of a power law incident spectrum on a relatively cold medium @xcite .",
    "therefore the lack of an iron line in our data is consistent with the absence of a reflected component the broad - band sax and rxte spectra of  @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the emission line models of ko and kallman @xcite for this relatively low luminosity source ( compared to sco x-1 which does show fe line emission ) , particularly if the disk in  is illuminated at relatively grazing angles from the central x - ray source .",
    "we observed  in its hard state , during which it emits hard x - rays .",
    "the weak variability of the source in x - rays suggests that it spends most of its time in such a hard state with a hard power law type spectrum in x - rays ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the soft excess detected at low energies is more likely originating from the accretion disk .",
    "as for the hard component , it more likely originates from the comptonization of soft photons in a hot boundary layer .",
    "the  value we have measured is consistent with the value expected from the cluster redenning .",
    "the consistency of this result with recent  measurements by sax and rxte suggests that the source does not display intrinsic ( and variable ) absorption .",
    "the lack of iron line emission is consistent with the absence of a reflected component in the broad band spectrum of the source .",
    "part of this work was supported by nasa grant ( to jeg ) nag5 - 2763 .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center operated by the nasa / goddard space flight center ."
