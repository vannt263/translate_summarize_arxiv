    "the study of ferromagnets  @xcite dates back to several years ago , following two main paths sometimes overlapping , i.e. the statistical mechanics approach to lattices , and the graph theory approach to networks  @xcite .",
    "a notable result , coming from their combination , is the modern network theory  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the latter extends the classical graph theory to the analysis of networks characterized by non - trivial topologies and containing a big amount of nodes .",
    "so , the role of statistical mechanics is to offer methods and strategies for investigating the properties and the dynamics of these complex networks  @xcite .",
    "usually , investigations on ferromagnets are performed using the ising model  @xcite , mainly because the latter constitutes a simple and powerful tool for studying phase transitions and further applications , also beyond the domain of statistical mechanics ( e.g. data science  @xcite and machine learning  @xcite ) . despite its simplicity ,",
    "the ising model becomes , itself , a very hard problem ( not yet solved ) when studied in dimensions greater than @xmath1 . in those cases , the curie - weiss  @xcite model allows to approximate its behavior , with the advantage to be also analytically tractable . in both models , namely ising and curie - weiss ,",
    "the numerical simulations require the utilization of monte carlo methods  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the metropolis algorithm  @xcite constitutes one of the early , and most adopted , strategies for simulating thermalization processes over a lattice .",
    "this latter algorithm is based on the optimization of the hamiltonian function representing the energy of the system .",
    "notably , the hamiltonian of the ising model reads @xmath2 where the summation is extended to all the nearest neighbors @xmath3 in the lattice ( realized with periodic boundary conditions , so actually becoming , in topological terms , a toroid ) . as result , the value of the hamiltonian  [ eq : ising ] depends on the set @xmath4 , i.e. the configuration of spins @xmath5 in the lattice .",
    "accordingly , the two ground states of the system correspond to the spin configurations @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "therefore , considering a lattice with @xmath8 sites , and starting with a random configuration @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 $ ] , the metropolis algorithm leads the system towards one of the two ground states .",
    "this algorithm is based on two simple steps    1 .",
    "randomly select a site @xmath11 , and compute the local @xmath12 associated to its spin flip 2 .",
    "if ( @xmath13 ) : accept the flip ; + else : accept the flip with probability @xmath14    repeated until a ground state is reached .",
    "we remind that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , appearing in the probability shown in the step @xmath17 of the metropolis algorithm , refer to the boltzmann constant and to the system temperature , respectively .",
    "in addition , the term local @xmath12 , used in the step @xmath18 , indicates that the difference in energy is computed considering only the site @xmath11 and its nearest neighbors .",
    "thus , in principle , some flips may increase the global energy of the whole system .",
    "in general , the process simulated by the metropolis algorithm takes into account the fact that the ferromagnetic interactions @xmath19 are _ quenched _ , i.e. the thermalization is fast enough to allow to consider the interactions as constant . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. with non - constant interactions , we have different scenarios .",
    "for instance , a spin system can become glassy by introducing anti - ferromagnetic interactions ( i.e. @xmath20 ) , or can undergo a dilution process by removing interactions ( i.e. setting @xmath21 ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on dilution of ferromagnets introducing a strategy , based on the erds - renyi model  @xcite , for modeling this process .",
    "it is worth to recall that previous investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ) highlighted the critical behavior of diluted ferromagnets .",
    "so , beyond providing a novel method for dilution , we give also a description of some statistical properties of the resulting system , of the dynamical processes living on it , and on potential applications . to this end",
    ", the analyses are performed in two different conditions : for introducing the dilution strategy and studying some properties of the ferromagnets , the spin variables ( i.e. @xmath5 ) are considered as _ quenched _ , while for studying thermalization processes after a dilution , the _ quenched _ variables are the interactions @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the proposed strategy and the related analyses are performed by means of numerical simulations . beyond describing the behavior of our model",
    ", we emphasize that the achieved results allow also to envision potential applications in the area of complex networks .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] introduces the proposed strategy .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows results of numerical simulations .",
    "eventually , section  [ sec : conclusion ] provides a description of the main findings .",
    "let us consider ferromagnets of dimension @xmath0 , modeled via the curie - weiss ( cw hereinafter ) model .",
    "the latter is composed of @xmath8 sites , with a position @xmath11 and a spin @xmath22 . here",
    ", the interactions are not limited to the nearest neighbors ( like in the ising model ) , but are extended to all the system , i.e. every site interacts with all the others .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian of the cw model reads @xmath23 with @xmath24 , i.e. combination of spins @xmath5 .",
    "then , like in the ising model , the two ground states correspond to the spin configurations @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. those that minimize the value of @xmath27  eq.[eq : cw ] .",
    "it is worth to highlight that the cw model can be represented as a complete ( i.e. fully - connected ) graph , where each site corresponds to a node , and each interaction to an edge .",
    "in addition , the number of interactions is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the mapping from the physical object ( i.e. the ferromagnet ) to the mathematical entity ( i.e. the graph ) allows to map a dilution to a pruning process . however , before presenting the dilution strategy developed with the framework of graph theory , we discuss the application of a more classical method , i.e. the previously mentioned metropolis algorithm .      in principle , the metropolis algorithm , and similar methods , may be used for modeling the dilution of ferromagnets .",
    "notably , since this algorithm modifies spins from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and vice versa , according to the energy difference resulting from the spin flipping , an opportune variant say metropolis - like , might be used for flipping the interaction variables @xmath19 . in the case of spin flipping the possible values that @xmath5 can take are @xmath31 whereas , in the case of interactions @xmath19 , the latter may take three different values : @xmath29 ( i.e. ferromagnetic ) , @xmath30 ( i.e. anti - ferromagnetic ) , @xmath32 ( i.e. removal ) .",
    "thus , a metropolis - like algorithm devised for flipping interactions may , in principle , generate a spin glass  @xcite ( flipping @xmath19 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) , and perform a dilution ( flipping @xmath19 from @xmath29 to @xmath32 ) .",
    "in addition , both processes ( i.e. from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and to @xmath32 ) can be combined , modeling the emergence of a diluted spin glass .",
    "hence , focusing on dilution , from now on , we consider only the case @xmath33 . in",
    "doing so , a metropolis - like algorithm ( m - l hereinafter ) can be defined as follows :    1 .",
    "randomly select an interaction @xmath19 between two sites , and compute the local @xmath12 associated to its flip to @xmath32 2 .   if ( @xmath13 ) : accept the flip ; + else : accept the flip with probability @xmath14    as in the thermalization processes , the m - l strategy depends on the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "furthermore , one might consider also flipping of @xmath19 from @xmath32 to @xmath29 , i.e. modeling a kind of ( edge ) re - population . however , since the addition of interactions between inverse spins would increase the hamiltonian , the actual realization of flipping @xmath34 would be quite rare .      now , with the aim to introduce our model , we go back to description of ferromagnets with the formal language of graph theory . in general , a graph @xmath35 is an entity composed of two sets : @xmath8 ( i.e. nodes ) and @xmath36 ( i.e. edges ) . as above reported , the maximum number of edges ( i.e. @xmath37 ) depends on @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the edges can be provided with some properties , as a direction , a weight , and so on , in order to represent specific characteristics of the object their refer to ( e.g. a ferromagnet , or a real network as a social network  @xcite , a biological network  @xcite , a financial network  @xcite , and many others ) . in the proposed model ,",
    "edges have no particular properties ( i.e. they are indirect and unweighted ) , and the graph is implemented via the e - r model .",
    "the latter is realized by defining a number of nodes @xmath8 and a parameter @xmath38 , which represents the probability of each edge to exist .",
    "thus , the expected number of edges in an e - r graph is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "notably , decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath38 entails to remove ( add ) edges in the graph .",
    "the algorithm for generating an e - r graph is very simple :    1 .   define the number of @xmath8 of nodes and the probability @xmath38 2 .",
    "draw each edge with probability @xmath38 +    in particular , in the step @xmath17 , all possible @xmath37 edges are considered .",
    "therefore , an e - r graph generated with @xmath40 contains exactly @xmath37 edges ( i.e. it is complete ) , and constitutes the graphical counterpart of the cw model previously described .",
    "the tuning of the parameter @xmath38 allows to represent ferromagnets with different amounts of interactions .",
    "thus graphs generated with @xmath41 ( i.e. having @xmath42 ) represent diluted ferromagnets .",
    "this last observation constitutes the base of our model , i.e. an e - r - like ( er - l hereinafter ) model devised for dilution processes . for the sake of clarity , now we provide a pictorial representation for highlighting their main differences between two mentioned strategies , i.e. m - l and er",
    "- l see figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] .",
    "so , a quick glance to the pictorial representation allows to observe what follows : _ i _ )",
    "the er - l strategy starts with non - connected nodes then populates the graphs with new edges , while the m - l strategy starts with a complete graph and then removes the edges ; _ ii _ ) the er - l strategy allows to obtain more configurations than the m - l strategy , being the latter hamiltonian - dependent. in particular , once the hamiltonian has been optimized , further actions ( i.e. edge removal ) have very low probability . on the other hand , the er - l strategy , being hamiltonian - independent ,",
    "allows the realization of ferromagnets with higher degree of dilution . for this reason ,",
    "m - l is closer to a physical realization of a dilution than er - l .",
    "we are now ready to present the er - l strategy in detail .",
    "firstly , the er - l uses a parameter @xmath43 $ ] , representing a kind of control in the dilution process .",
    "notably , @xmath44 entails the process is not controlled , while @xmath45 entails a fully controlled process .",
    "it is worth noting that , while the dilution of a ferromagnet does not need any control , being driven towards the optimization of a hamiltonian , using a probabilistic model ( i.e. the er - l ) , whose dynamics does not depend on any hamiltonian , the so - called control parameter @xmath46 becomes fundamental for approaching the behavior of a physical dilution .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 compensates for the energy independence of the proposed strategy . accordingly , the edge probability @xmath38 is corrected as follows @xmath47 with @xmath48 step function and @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 in doing so , @xmath51 when @xmath49 has a null or a negative value and , at the same time , the normalization condition ( i.e. @xmath52 ) is respected for any value of @xmath38 , and of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , varying the parameter @xmath53 , we can study the hamiltonian of the resulting diluted ferromagnet and its behavior . before illustrating the results of numerical simulations",
    ", it is important to elucidate a further aspect of our investigation . as previously reported , when studying the equilibrium configuration of a spin system , the interaction variables @xmath19 are considered _",
    "so , with the aim to analyze the behavior of diluted ferromagnets , the variation of @xmath19 must be faster than that of @xmath5 , i.e. the latter is _",
    "quenched_. now , having defined the er - l model , we discuss how it can be used .",
    "first , one can realize a diluted ferromagnet via er - l , studying then its properties .",
    "second , one can analyze the behavior of the ferromagnet during the dilution process . while a single realization , of a diluted ferromagnet , is very similar to the realization of a graph via the e - r model , i.e. drawing edges according to the @xmath53 probability",
    ", it is worth to explain how to implement a continuous dilution process by the er - l model . to this end , let us consider a dilution as the motion of a graph @xmath35 over a phase space , along an axis-@xmath38 .",
    "the phase space is larger for low values of @xmath38 , and becomes narrower as @xmath38 increases , until it contains only one state when @xmath54 ( i.e. fully - connected ) .",
    "the lower @xmath38 , the larger the number of possible realizations of @xmath35 with the same amount of edges ( i.e. higher its entropy , see also  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "so in a continuous dilution , beyond considering the effect of @xmath46 , one can be able to move from a state , say @xmath55 , to a state @xmath56 without losing information about the edges existing at @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the er - l must account for the removal of a density of edges equal to @xmath60 , preserving the remaining structure of the graph . therefore , the simple generation of a first graph with @xmath61 , and then with @xmath62 , is not allowed because the two resulting graphs are not correlated .",
    "thus , in the considered example , the continuous dilution process entails to move in the phase space of the graph by removing each edge with a probability much smaller than @xmath63 , in order to consider also the effect of @xmath64 . to generalize , given @xmath64 and @xmath63 , with @xmath65 ,",
    "if an edge @xmath66 ( i.e. connecting sites @xmath11 and @xmath67 ) belonging to the graph in the state @xmath68 has to be confirmed in the state @xmath69 , one can not simply use @xmath63 because , after the process , the edge @xmath66 would be present with probability @xmath70 , that is obviously smaller than @xmath63 . for this reason , we need to compute the factor @xmath71 such that , @xmath72 . in this way , at @xmath73 , each edge remains in the graph with probability @xmath74 . in a similar fashion , we implement the inverse process , i.e. repopulating the graph with missing edges , from the state @xmath75 to @xmath76 , now having @xmath77 . in particular , a new edge ( always defined @xmath78 ) must be added to @xmath35 with a probability @xmath79 , coming from the following relation : @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 . summarizing , while a diluted ferromagnet can be realized with a single instance of the er - l model , a continuous dilution can be implemented as follows :    1 .",
    "generate a graph @xmath82 and define the sampling rate for the dilution , i.e. @xmath83 ; 2 .   while @xmath84 : 3 .",
    "_ _ remove each edge in @xmath35 with probability @xmath85 4 .   _ _",
    "@xmath86    the parameter @xmath87 represents the final edge probability @xmath38 , i.e. the probability one should use for generating via the e - r model a graph similar to that resulting from the dilution process .",
    "@xmath88 corresponds to the starting value of @xmath38 for generating the initial graph , and @xmath89 corresponds to the value of @xmath38 at step @xmath90 .",
    "the inverse process , i.e. the graph re - population , can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "generate a graph @xmath82 and define the sampling rate for the re - population , i.e. @xmath83 ; 2 .   while @xmath91 : 3 .",
    "_ _ add each new potential edge in @xmath35 with probability @xmath92 4 .   _ _",
    "@xmath93    as @xmath87 , @xmath94 represents the final value of @xmath38 one should use for generating a similar graph ( i.e. with same statistical properties ) , achieved after re - population , using the e - r model .",
    "moreover , we clarify that new potential edge refers to the edges that can be added to the graph for making it again fully - connected , i.e. it refers only to missing edges .",
    "eventually , we analyze also thermalization processes ( considering , after each dilution , the variables @xmath19 as _ quenched _ ) . to this end , the system magnetization defined as @xmath95 offers a macroscopic view on the process .",
    "notably , we recall that the magnetization is an order - parameter and allows both to observe the emergence of a phase transition , and to evaluate its nature ( e.g. first order ) . in addition , it is worth emphasizing that _ quenched _ spins entail the magnetization is always null ( i.e. the system remains in a disordered phase ) .",
    "further analyses devised for studying the behavior of our model are introduced in the following section .",
    "the proposed model is studied by means of numerical simulations , considering ferromagnets composed of @xmath96 sites . in particular",
    ", we aim to obtain diluted ferromagnets with single realizations of the er - l strategy , and to use the latter for modeling continuous dilution and re - population processes .",
    "in addition , we analyze thermalization processes on the resulting diluted ferromagnets and , eventually , we present a potential application in the field of complex networks , i.e. in the evaluation of community stability  @xcite .",
    "we start considering different realizations of ferromagnets via the er - l model , on varying @xmath38 and @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_2 ] shows the ( absolute value of ) hamiltonian @xmath97 , normalized over the actual number of edges @xmath98 , which reads @xmath99 with @xmath4 denoting a specific spin configuration .        as expected , the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "[ eq : actual_h ] ) is equal to zero when there is no control in the dilution process , since interactions are removed without considering the spin of related nodes . on the contrary , increasing @xmath46 , we observe that the hamiltonian increases up to @xmath100 we remind that we are considering the absolute value of the hamiltonian , so that its actual value is @xmath30 . for @xmath101",
    ", the maximum of @xmath102 can be reached spanning @xmath38 within well defined ranges .",
    "notably , the latter enlarges by increasing @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath103 the optimal @xmath97 is obtained with @xmath104 , while when @xmath45 the optimal @xmath97 is obtained with @xmath105 .",
    "it is worth clarifying that we can not study the dilution in function of @xmath53 , since its value depends on the involved spins , so consequently being potentially different from edge to edge .",
    "this preliminary investigation constitutes an early indicator of the existence of a critical edge probability @xmath106 , i.e. the highest value of @xmath38 to have @xmath107 .",
    "now , we start analyzing continuous dilution and repopulation processes .",
    "before to show results of simulations , let us highlight that modeling a continuous dilution entails to start the process from a fully - connected graph .",
    "therefore , considering fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_3 ] , here the direction of a dilution corresponds to that of the m - l strategy while , obviously , a repopulation follows the inverse path .",
    "the pictorial representation of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_3 ] aims to give an overview about the continuous dilution process ( via er - l ) in two conditions : non - controlled ( @xmath44 ) and fully controlled ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "provided that the starting graph and the landing one are equal in both cases , a quick glance to the pictorial allows to appreciate the influence of @xmath108 . in particular , the intermediate graphs , between the starting and the ending ones , are related to those achieved via the er - l method setting @xmath109 .",
    "notably , in the case @xmath44 , the graph is obtained setting @xmath110 , while in the case @xmath45 the plot illustrates a graph achieved with @xmath111 and one with @xmath110 .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath112 , the resulting graph appears perfectly divided between the two communities ( i.e. spins @xmath29 separated from spins @xmath30 ) .",
    "instead , for values of @xmath38 slightly higher than @xmath113 , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_3 ] , the two communities are connected by few edges .",
    "this observation is very important , because strongly related to thermalization processes ( i.e. when the variables @xmath19 are taken as _ quenched _ after the dilution step ) .",
    "numerical simulations , shown in fig .  [ fig : figure_4 ] , demonstrate that the er - l strategy is able to dilute and to repopulate a graph , no matter the value of @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , implementing the two processes as a cycle , we did not find any form of hysteresis , i.e. dilution and repopulation cover two perfectly overlapping paths in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_4 ] .",
    "only in the case with @xmath44 , we found an observable difference between the two paths , which can still be considered negligible .",
    "now , we study thermalization processes on ferromagnets diluted with different @xmath46 . to this end",
    ", ferromagnets can be diluted both implementing single realizations of the er - l strategy ( as we did here ) , and by performing the continuous dilution , i.e. considering the resulting graph obtained at each step .",
    "moreover , we remind that thermalization is analyzed by studying the average magnetization ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eq : magnetization ] ) of the system see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_5 ] .        in all cases",
    ", it seems that the order - disorder phase transition occurring in the ferromagnet is of first order , no matter the value of @xmath46 . at the same time",
    ", the latter strongly affects the critical @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath44 we found @xmath114 , while for @xmath45 the value is smaller than @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath116 , the transition is caused by the relevant reduction of edges , so that without interactions the thermalization can not take place .",
    "on the contrary , increasing @xmath46 , the order - disorder phase transition is caused initially by a combined effect of edge reduction and community separation , until @xmath45 , where the disordered phase is reached for the emergence of two well separated , and ordered , communities having opposite spin ( i.e. one with @xmath117 and one with @xmath118 ) see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_5 ] .",
    "in addition , we found that with @xmath119 and @xmath45 , the average ( absolute ) value of the magnetization and the variance are equal , proving its role as the critical @xmath106 . to conclude",
    ", we remind that these simulations have been performed on ferromagnets containing an equal amount of positive and negative spins .",
    "the proposed strategy aims to perform dilution processes on ferromagnets using , as reference , a well - established random graph model ( i.e. the e - r model ) .",
    "the latter is widely used in the modern theory of networks for studying dynamical processes , and structural properties of complex networks .",
    "now , we want to evaluate if a modification of the e - r model that we introduced , i.e. the er - l strategy , can be useful for extracting information from a complex network . in particular , we envision a potential application in the task of measuring the stability of a community , i.e. if according to the properties of its nodes , it risks to disappear after a while .",
    "notably , in a number of models studied in social dynamics  @xcite , often properties and behaviors are mapped onto binary spins  @xcite .",
    "so , in principle , one could use the hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : actual_h ] for measuring the stability of a community  @xcite , i.e. the higher its @xmath102 the higher the probability that the community survives over time . even if only the analysis of real datasets would allow to confirm the validity of this hypothesis , and then also the usefulness in the area of complex networks of the proposed strategy , our assumption is based on the simple observation that groups of individuals are more likely to cluster together when share common interests , opinions , and so on .",
    "moreover , beyond observations of real scenarios , this mechanism is confirmed by the positive assortativity  @xcite that social networks show , i.e. individuals are more likely to interact with their likes .",
    "so , since the case with binary spins has been previously studied , even if referred to dilution processes , here we focus on two main analyses .",
    "first we study the influence of heterogeneity in a complete community , measuring how the hamiltonian decreases while increasing the amount of nodes with different spins .",
    "second , we study the hamiltonian of a graph , considering the xy model  @xcite as reference . in doing so , we are able to represent situations where there are more than @xmath120 opinions ( e.g.  @xcite ) , states , or behaviors .",
    "the first investigation considers , at the beginning , the combination named @xmath121 , then some spins flip increasing the density of nodes with spin @xmath30 ( this process leads to the same results also considering the inverse case , i.e. starting with @xmath122 and then flipping spins to @xmath29 ) .",
    "results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_6 ] .",
    "as expected , the minimum of @xmath102 is reached when the number of @xmath29 spins is equal to that of @xmath30 spins . finally , we analyzed the hamiltonian of a community using the xy model .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_7 ] reports the related results , for different @xmath46 , and considering both @xmath123 different states , and @xmath124 different states . here",
    ", the pairs of spins are evaluated according to the cosine similarity @xmath125 , with @xmath126 and @xmath127 representing the value of the involved spins .",
    "we observe two main differences from the classical binary spins .",
    "in particular , using the xy model , the decrease of the hamiltonian is smoother in the xy model than in the ising model , where it appears less monotonous .",
    "furthermore , the maximum value of @xmath102 is always smaller than @xmath128 .",
    "accordingly , we note that communities are more stable ( or robust to spin flipping ) when there are more than @xmath120 states characterizing the related nodes . on the other hand",
    ", many possible states do not allow to reach a perfect stability ( i.e. @xmath129 ) , exposing a community to a higher risk to disappear .",
    "this work introduces a strategy , named er - l , for modeling the dilution of ferromagnets using the framework of modern network theory .",
    "in particular , we adopt as reference the e - r graph model , since the latter , under opportune conditions , constitutes the graphical representation of the curie - weiss model .",
    "the proposed method is hamiltonian - independent , i.e. while a metropolis - like strategy can dilute a ferromagnet according to energy - based rules , the er - l strategy depends on a parameter @xmath46 , which represents a kind of control in the dilution .",
    "notably , diluting a ferromagnet can be thought as pruning a graph @xmath35 , moving the latter in a phase space composed of all its possible realizations .",
    "the amount of edges ( i.e. interactions ) depends on the parameter @xmath38 of the er - l model , so our strategy moves @xmath35 along the axis @xmath38 . in doing so , @xmath35 undergoes a kind of phase transition ( see also  @xcite ) , where different structures can be obtained , from sparse nodes to a complete graph .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath46 ensures that the motion along the @xmath38 axis , on the phase space , corresponds to that followed by a ferromagnet during a spontaneous dilution . in particular , like during thermalization , a system tends to naturally reach an equilibrium state that minimizes its energy . in a similar fashion",
    ", spontaneous dilutions should lead the system towards a ground state .",
    "results indicate that er",
    "- l is able to perform this task for different values of @xmath46 , depending on the considered @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we also analyzed the closed path ( i.e. the cycle ) from a complete graph to single nodes , and then to a complete graph by repopulating with new edges the diluted graph .",
    "it is worth to highlight that er - l allows to dilute a graph also after its hamiltonian has been minimized , while a metropolis - like strategy , being hamiltonian - dependent , would not be able .",
    "therefore , not all the structures obtained via er - l have a physical meaning .",
    "however , during a continuous dilution , we can discriminate those that appear without a physical meaning , computing the difference of the hamiltonian between the two structures .",
    "the related analyses have been performed considering the spin variables @xmath5 as _",
    "quenched_. so , we studied also the opposite case , i.e. after a dilution the interactions @xmath19 become _ quenched _ , and the spins can flip towards an equilibrium state . in order to study this process , and to make a relation with the parameter @xmath38 , we analyze the average magnetization achieved at equilibrium , which provides an indication about the phase transitions occurring in the system see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_5 ] . once analyzed the outcomes of the er - l strategy , we performed a further analysis for evaluating the opportunity to apply it to further tasks , in particular considering the measure of stability of communities in complex networks .",
    "first we analyzed the variation of the hamiltonian turning an ordered system to a disordered one .",
    "then , we studied the hamiltonian considering as reference the xy model , i.e. admitting spins with more than @xmath120 values .",
    "this preliminary investigation suggests that er - l may , in principle , be useful for evaluating the risk that a community will dissolve after a while , according to the degree of heterogeneity of its individuals ( e.g. in terms of opinions , interests , and so on ) .",
    "in addition , we found that communities whose nodes have more possible states ( e.g. opinions ) , never reach a perfect stability ( i.e. @xmath130 ) but can be more robust than those with binary spins to the emergence of interaction between different individuals .",
    "obviously , we are not taking into account all the social processes that may occur in real systems , e.g. once two different individuals interact , one might imitate the other , relaxing the system .",
    "moreover , considering the two strategies here described , i.e. er - l and m - l , we deem important to mention that , in principle , they might constitute also the base for developing learning algorithms  @xcite .",
    "notably , almost all simulations have been carried on considering an equal distribution of positive and negative spins , however different combinations ( i.e. patterns ) might be used .",
    "therefore , the optimization of the hamiltonian during the dilution , in our view , even if referred to only one pattern , can be actually interpreted as a form of learning in a neural network  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , further investigations are required for evaluating whether the proposed model may allow the graph to learn and store more than one pattern .",
    "finally , we remark that , in order to assess the actual usefulness of er - l for evaluating the community stability , further investigations based on real datasets are definitely mandatory .",
