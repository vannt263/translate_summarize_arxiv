    "the fermionic isotope of potassium @xmath0k is among the most interesting atomic species for the experimental study of quantum degenerate gases , as early discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of cooling a sample of fermionic @xmath0k atoms to the regime of quantum degeneracy has been demonstrated @xcite , by means of evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap .",
    "this is the first step towards further studies on a dilute fermi system , including the possibility of cooper pairing . as for this prospect",
    ", the presence of feshbach resonances in the scattering length of selected zeeman substates of @xmath0k @xcite , induced by a magnetic field , could be exploited to bring the required temperatures for a bcs - like phase transition to a range experimentally achievable .",
    "optical traps appear to be very useful tools for investigating such collisional properties of atoms at low temperature , since they can hold high - density samples in any spin state , and an homogeneous magnetic field can be applied without modification of the trapping potential @xcite . for the particular case of @xmath0k ,",
    "the most interesting feshbach resonance has been predicted for two spin states which are not magnetically trappable , and therefore an optical trap would be necessary @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report for the first time on optical trapping of a sample of @xmath0k , precooled in a magneto - optical trap to sub - doppler temperatures @xcite . by using a compression phase followed by optical molasses cooling",
    "we obtain trapped samples at relatively low temperature ( 65  @xmath4k ) and high density ( 10@xmath2  @xmath3 ) . in this temperature and density regime",
    ", our optical trap appears to be an interesting environment to investigate the collisional properties of @xmath0k , possibly including the predicted feshbach resonances .",
    "we are indeed able to perform elastic collisional measurements on unpolarized sample of atoms in the ground f=9/2 state , and inelastic measurements on samples in the f=9/2 and f=7/2 hyperfine substates , which are both held in the optical trap .",
    "a comparison with theoretical predictions is made in both cases , and a good agreement is found .",
    "the optical trap is realized with linearly polarized light from a single - mode ti : sa laser , detuned to the red of both the d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 transitions of potassium , respectively at 769.9  nm , and 766.7  nm .",
    "the laser radiation is arranged in a vertical standing - wave configuration , by retroreflecting the beam , achieving a 1d optical lattice with the strongest confinement against gravity .",
    "the laser beam is weakly focused within a two - lens telescope to a waist - size @xmath7=90  @xmath4 m , with a rayleigh length @xmath8=3  cm ; the effective running wave power at the waist position is p=600  mw . a schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ apparatus ] .    the use of a tunable ti : sa laser allows us to change in a continuous way the trap detuning from a few nanometers to about 40  nm , allowing a variety of trap conditions . for a typical wavelength of the trapping laser @xmath9=787  nm",
    ", the calculated trap depth@xcite for the ground state is @xmath10=300  @xmath4k ( 6.2  mhz ) and the scattering rate is @xmath11=30  s@xmath12 .",
    "since the trapping light is very far detuned from any transition starting from the excited 4p states , the light shift for both the excited states is positive , and it is approximately half of the trap depth .",
    "the vibrational frequencies of each lattice site are given , in the harmonic approximation , by @xmath13 in the axial and radial directions , respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 is the mass of potassium .",
    "the expected values of the radial and axial trap frequencies for the conditions above are respectively @xmath15870  hz and @xmath15450  khz .",
    "the power of the trapping laser can be controlled with a fast aom ( with a fall time of 300  ns ) ; a polarizer cube after the aom provides the required linear polarization .",
    "the pump laser is a low - noise doubled nd : yvo , and no active stabilization or tuning of the ti : sa laser frequency is used , to avoid amplitude noise which can possibly heat up the trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "we load the optical trap directly from a vapor cell magneto - optical trap ( mot ) of @xmath0k as described in @xcite .",
    "we note the typical cooling and repumping light intensities of 36  mw/@xmath16 and 4  mw/@xmath16 respectively , and the detuning of the cooling light of -20  mhz from the cycling f=9/2  @xmath17  f@xmath18=11/2 transition ( the natural linewidth and saturation intensities of @xmath0k are @xmath19=2@xmath206.2  mhz and @xmath21=1.8  mw/@xmath16 ) . in the mot",
    "we collect in 4  s about @xmath22 atoms at a peak density of @xmath23  @xmath3 and at a temperature of 60  @xmath4k .",
    "the dipole trap beam , which is passing approximately through the center of the mot , is left on during the mot loading , with no detectable effect on the atom number or temperature .    to load the optical lattice from the mot we use the following procedure :",
    "the trapped atoms are compressed for 30  ms by ramping the quadrupole gradient of the mot from the normal value of 18  gauss / cm up to 44  gauss / cm , while the intensity of the cooling and repumping light are abruptly reduced to 20  mw/@xmath16 and 0.06  mw/@xmath16 respectively . moreover ,",
    "the detuning of the cooling light is reduced to -6  mhz to improve the compression effect .",
    "the mot quadrupole field is then switched off in 1  ms , and the detuning of the cooling light is increased to -20  mhz for other 2  ms , providing the usual optical molasses cooling . then the mot beams are turned off by switching off the aoms in a few @xmath4s .",
    "the repumping beams are turned off 1  ms later than the cooling ones , to pump the atoms in the lower hyperfine ground state , f=9/2 . for a complete shielding of the optical trap from the resonant stray light of the mot beams , which could cause undesired optical excitation and pumping",
    ", we also block the light with a mechanical shutter within 3  ms from the switch - off of the aoms . using this procedure , about",
    "5% of the atoms in the mot can be loaded in the optical trap , corresponding to a few 10@xmath24 atoms .",
    "the atoms in the optical trap are probed by turning on again the mot beams at half the normal intensity and in resonance with the cycling transition , while the repumper is in resonance with the f=7/2  @xmath17  f@xmath18=9/2 .",
    "the fluorescence is detected by a photomultiplier with the help of a lens and of an optical fiber with a core diameter of approximately 0.5  mm , which provides good spatial selectivity to discard the light scattered by the windows of the vacuum cell , and allows detection of as few as 10@xmath25 atoms .",
    "a typical measurement of the lifetime of the optical trap is shown in fig .",
    "[ decayg ] . after about 0.3  s of storage",
    ", the decay curve of the atoms pumped in the ground f=9/2 state is a single exponential , with a 1/e lifetime of @xmath26=1.4(3 )  s. we expect the main source of loss in this regime to be collisions with background gas , the trap lifetime being roughly one third of the mot loading time",
    ". the faster decay at shorter times could possibly be due to losses connected to an evaporative cooling process , which we will consider below .",
    "alternatively , the density and the absolute number of trapped atoms can be measured by absorption imaging , using a pulse of light derived from the mot laser lasting 200  @xmath4s , at half the saturation intensity and in resonance with the cycling transition . to compensate for the light shift due to the optical trap ,",
    "the frequency is blue shifted by approximately 1.5@xmath27 from the unperturbed resonance .",
    "the beam is passing through the optical trap in the horizontal plane and is imaged on a ccd camera with a two - lens system .",
    "the distribution of atoms in the optical trap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ccd ] , is gaussian in the radial direction , with a typical fwhm of 70  @xmath4 m .",
    "also the axial distribution is generally gaussian , and the typical fwhm of 500  @xmath4 m indicates that approximately 1200 lattice sites , spaced by 395  nm , are occupied . the mean number density is determined by averaging the optical density over the trap section and scaling by the ratio of the lattice spacing @xmath28 to the the mean axial extension @xmath29 of an individual lattice site .",
    "such mean axial extension is estimated from the temperature and axial trap frequency as @xmath30 and is of the order of 100  nm .",
    "the typical mean density of atoms after 100  ms of storage is 7@xmath3110@xmath32  @xmath3 , and decays proportionally to the number of atoms for increasing storage times .",
    "the radial temperature is measured by detecting the radial extension of the atomic cloud after 1  ms of expansion , following a sudden switch - off of the optical trap .",
    "alternatively it is possible to estimate the temperature directly from the radial extensions of the atoms in the trap ; this estimation is affected by a larger uncertainty , since it relies on the knowledge of the radial trap frequency .",
    "the axial temperature is extracted from the temporal width of a time - of - flight ( tof ) signal , as detected by the absorption of a 1-cm wide sheet of light placed 1.5  cm below the trapping region , in resonance with the cycling transition .",
    "the tof beam , generated by an extended - cavity diode laser , is doubly passing through the vacuum cell , and the absorption signal is detected with a frequency modulation technique .",
    "the typical tof signal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tof ] , indicates the presence of two different velocity distributions , corresponding to temperatures around 70  @xmath4k for the broad peak and around 4  @xmath4k for the narrow one .",
    "we think that the colder component is due to a small fraction of the trapped atoms which are adiabatically cooled during the release from the optical trap . indeed , the aom which controls the optical trap is capable of cutting only 95% of the light in less than 300  ns , while the residual tail is extinguished in about 5  @xmath4s .",
    "since the latter switch - off time is longer than @xmath33 , the atoms in the bottom of the trap are further cooled down .",
    "we have verified this conjecture by intentionally slowing the main switch - off time of the aom down to 5  @xmath4s , and observing an adiabatic cooling of hotter component to 8  @xmath4k .",
    "we expect to be possible to eliminate such residual adiabatic cooling effect by using the aom in a double - pass configuration , but since this would reduce by about 30% the available laser power , we prefer to fit the tof signal with a two - component curve to accurately extract the temperature of the majority of the atoms .",
    "the temperature measurement described above can be performed only after a minimum storage time of 80  ms , to allow for the separation of the tof signal due to the atoms in the optical trap from the signal due to the atoms in the mot which have not been loaded in the trap .",
    "we have verified that after this time interval the axial and radial temperature are identical within the uncertainty .    to look for any relationship between the temperatures of the atoms in the mot and of those in the optical trap , we have performed a series of temperature measurements after 100  ms of storage in optical traps of different depths .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ loading ] : the temperature appears to scale almost linearly with the trap depth , and for deep traps we measure a ratio @xmath34@xmath354.5 . note that for very deep traps such a temperature can be much higher than the mot one , which is about 70  @xmath4k after the compression phase .",
    "this behavior , which has been reported also in @xcite , seems to indicate that the temperature of the atoms in the optical trap is determined by the process of loading and optical trapping itself , and not by the original temperature in the mot .",
    "we note also that the number of atoms loaded in the trap is observed to decrease almost linearly with the trap depth , with the density decreasing even faster due to the accompanying reduction in the spring constant of the trap . as a result ,",
    "the optimal density conditions for performing collisional measurements are found only at large trap depths , where the temperature of the trapped atoms is comparable to that of the mot .",
    "a detailed description of these observations goes beyond the scope of this paper , and will therefore be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have also observed that the temperature of the atoms in the optical trap remains almost constant with time , although the calculated scattering rate would lead to a constant heating with a rate as large as 100  @xmath4ks@xmath12 for the tightest trap investigated .",
    "also this result is suggesting the presence of an evaporative cooling effect , which counteracts the heating due to photon scattering .",
    "the effective trap depth and spring constants are measured with the help of a parametric heating technique @xcite .",
    "if the power of the trap light is sinusoidally modulated by the aom , a strong heating of the atoms , accompanied by trap losses , arises whenever the modulation frequency matches twice the trap oscillation frequency or a subharmonic thereof . by monitoring the trap population after @xmath35100  ms of parametric heating",
    "it is therefore possible to measure both radial and axial trap frequency with an uncertainty of the order of 10% . a typical measurement of the trap frequencies is shown in fig .  [ parametric ] , for a trap depth of 180  @xmath4k .",
    "note the presence of a strong resonance also at four times the axial frequency , which can be explained only by considering the anharmonicity of the optical trap in the axial direction , due to its sinusoidal shape @xcite .",
    "to characterize the elastic collisions we use a technique which has already proved useful in this kind of optical trap@xcite , which is based on the detection of the rethermalization of the trapped atoms after the excitation of one of the degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , we parametrically excite the axial vibrational mode of the trap by applying a 2% modulation to the laser power for about 5  ms , and measure the subsequent rapid increase of the axial temperature , followed by an exponential decay due to thermalization of the axial mode with the radial ones , as mediated by elastic collisions . in order to excite uniformly the atoms distributed over the vibrational levels in the anharmonic trap",
    ", we sweep the modulation frequency roughly between @xmath36 and 2@xmath36 during the 5  ms heating phase . indeed ,",
    "if only a single frequency is used , we observe a large loss of atoms from the trap , with no larger increase of the temperature , as if only the population of a few levels were excited .",
    "moreover , modulation amplitudes larger than 2% cause quite a large loss of atoms , which are detected by the tof beam together with those released from the trap , therefore altering the temperature measurements . the decay curve for the conditions",
    "@xmath37=  65@xmath4k , @xmath38=7.5@xmath3110@xmath32  @xmath3 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ decay ] ; each data point is the average of two series of about 20 tof measurements , and the original temperature was 67  @xmath4k .",
    "the fit to an exponential decay yelds @xmath39=10(2 )  s. we have checked that the decay time is halved , within the uncertainty , when the atomic density in the optical trap is halved , to verify that the rethermalization is actually mediated by elastic collisions , and not simply by cross - dimensional anharmonic effects .",
    "we compare the observed collision rates with the results of a full close - coupling numerical calculation with the standard hamiltonian including hyperfine structure .",
    "the model is parametrized by the long range dispersion coefficients of the atom - atom interaction potential and by single channel singlet and triplet scattering lengths .",
    "we adopt the high precision value @xmath403897au from ref.@xcite for the van der waals coefficient , and choose the range of possible scattering lengths by scaling to @xmath0k the results obtained for @xmath41k from an analysis of the @xmath42 @xcite molecular state photoassociation spectroscopy .",
    "similar but less restricted values are also presented in @xcite from an analysis of the @xmath43 spectrum .",
    "we obtain in this way the limits 100 @xmath44110a@xmath45 and 150 @xmath46250a@xmath45 . it is consistent with the experimental errors in the present measurements to fix the singlet scattering length to say @xmath47 and leave only the triplet as a free parameter .    from our calculation and from the results of an analogous experiment performed in a magnetic trap @xcite",
    ", we expect that both @xmath48- and @xmath49-wave collisions are contributing to the cross sections at @xmath37=65  @xmath4k for @xmath0k .",
    "indeed , a @xmath49-wave shape resonance close to threshold enhances the @xmath49-wave contribution at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "since our sample is unpolarized we calculate spherical @xmath48 and @xmath49 cross sections @xmath50 , and estimate the thermalization rate as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the average number of collisions necessary for the rethermalization , @xmath38 is the atomic density , and @xmath53 is the rms relative velocity between two colliding atoms .",
    "note that we have implicitly assumed an identical distribution of all possible spin states in f=9/2 over the optical trap , since the trap potential is independent of the magnetic moment of the atoms .",
    "we adopt for the parameters @xmath52 the values @xmath54 and @xmath55 quoted in @xcite .",
    "we find the best agreement with the measured rate at the lowest allowed value of the triplet scattering length ( @xmath56=150@xmath57 ) , _ i.e. _ when the @xmath49-wave resonance is closer to threshold .",
    "in this situation the average thermal rates are @xmath58=@xmath59cm@xmath25/s and @xmath61=@xmath62cm@xmath25/s and the characteristic time for rethermalization for the given density in the trap is then about @xmath39=20  ms .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a comparison between the photoassociation results in @xcite and @xcite seems to privilege lower values of @xmath56 in agreement with what we find here .    from the calculated elastic collision rate 1/@xmath63 , with @xmath50 the total cross section ,",
    "is also possible to estimate the typical speed of the thermalization due to evaporative cooling processes . using the formalism presented in @xcite , the ratio of the evaporation to the elastic collision time constant is @xmath64 where @xmath65=@xmath27/@xmath66 . from the measured value of @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ loading ] ) , the timescale for the thermalization due to evaporation is therefore expected to be a few hundreds of ms .",
    "although this process can be neglected with regard to the cross - dimensional collisional processes reported above , which are proceeding at a much faster rate , we speculate that it could play an important role in the observed long term stability of the temperature of the atoms in the optical trap .      the inelastic two - body collisions between atoms in the f=7/2 state , and between atoms in the f=9/2 and f=7/2 states , can be detected in a relatively easy way through trap losses , since the hyperfine energy of 1.285  ghz released under the transition f=7/2@xmath179/2 is much larger than the trap depth .",
    "we can vary the population of the upper hyperfine state f=7/2 by means of an optical pumping beam , derived from the mot laser , in resonance with the f=9/2@xmath17f@xmath18=7/2 transition , and controllable in intensity with an aom . by shining the beam on the trapped atoms with an intensity of about 10  @xmath4w/@xmath16 , and for a time interval variable between 0.1 and 2  ms , we transfer up to 95% of the atoms from the ground to the upper state .",
    "the relative populations of the two hyperfine states after the pumping pulse are measured by monitoring the tof signal , to which only the atoms in f=9/2 contribute .",
    "we have verified that the typical time scale for hyperfine optical pumping due to inelastic raman scattering of the trap photons is much longer than 1  s , and therefore such effect is negligible .",
    "the optical pumping pulse is applied after about 100  ms from the loading of the dipole trap , to let the trapped atoms equilibrate , and then the decay of the number of atoms in the trap is measured with the usual procedure . in fig .",
    "[ hyperfine ] the decay of the trapped atoms is shown for the cases of 95% and 85% of the total population pumped into the f=7/2 state . in this particular measurement",
    "the temperature of the atoms was @xmath37=50  @xmath4k .",
    "we fit the experimental data by assuming a constant volume regime , which in an harmonic trap is equivalent to the assumption of a constant temperature . in this regime ,",
    "the density is proportional to the number of atoms , and the decay curves are the solutions of the coupled differential equations for the densities of the populations in both hyperfine states @xmath68 here the suffixes 1 and 2 refer to the levels f=9/2 and f=7/2 , respectively , @xmath69 is the rate of linear trap loss , and @xmath70 is the spherical rate of two - body inelastic collisions between atoms in states @xmath71 and @xmath72 at temperature @xmath37 . to account for the loss of both atoms in the pair for each collision event",
    ", factors of 2 are added for collisions of atoms belonging to the same hyperfine level .",
    "the constant @xmath69 can be obtained from the tails of the decay curve , where the binary collision rate is negligible .",
    "the fit yields @xmath69=(0.90@xmath730.05 )  s@xmath12 .",
    "we keep this value fixed for the fits where we have 95% , 83% and 66% of the atoms in f=7/2 . we assume a 30% uncertainty in the atomic density and obtain best estimates of the decay rates from the individual curves .",
    "next we combine the three measurements to obtain @xmath74=3.2@xmath3110@xmath75  cm@xmath25/s and @xmath76=3.8@xmath3110@xmath77  cm@xmath25/s with an uncertainty of the order of 50% . from numerical calculations we find thermally averaged spherical rates of @xmath74=4.4@xmath3110@xmath78  cm@xmath25/s and @xmath76=3.5@xmath3110@xmath77  cm@xmath25/s for @xmath37=50@xmath4k , in agreement with the measured rate .",
    "we obtain these values at the lower edge @xmath79=150@xmath57 of the initial confidence range .",
    "the agreement holds until the value @xmath80 , where the loss coefficient @xmath76 drops to values of the order of @xmath81  cm@xmath25/s . in all this",
    "range @xmath49-wave losses provide a significant contribution to both @xmath74 and @xmath76 , and the agreement with the measured values represents therefore further evidence of the presence of a low energy @xmath49-wave resonance .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the rate coefficient @xmath82 rapidly increases above @xmath79=180@xmath57 , reaching values larger than 10@xmath78  cm@xmath25/s for @xmath83 , in disagreement with the measured value .",
    "this seem to rule out the higher range of @xmath79 values , as already indicated by the large observed rethermalization rate .",
    "we also note that inelastic collisions can not be responsible for the faster decay of the atom number at short trapping times ( see fig .",
    "[ decayg ] ) , even assuming a residual 5% on the f=7/2 state after the normal loading of the optical trap , due to the relatively small value of @xmath76 .",
    "we have reported on loading of fermionic @xmath0k atoms in a 1d optical lattice from a single mot .",
    "the 1.4-s lifetime of the optical trap is large enough to allow the observation of elastic and inelastic collisional processes , due to the high density of the atomic sample in the trap . indeed ,",
    "the typical time scale for collisional processes is a few tens of ms , at a density of 7@xmath3110@xmath32  @xmath3 and at a temperature of 65  @xmath4k .",
    "furthermore , optical pumping and heating effects arising from the scattering of trap photons do not seem to play a significant role on such time scale .",
    "the experimental collisional rates for unpolarized samples we determine are quite consistent with the theoretical expectations .",
    "further studies of inelastic and elastic collisions in spin - polarized samples in our optical trap could lead to a characterization of the collisional properties of fermionic potassium at low temperature . as already noted ,",
    "particularly interesting is the possibility of searching for the occurrence of @xmath48-wave feshbach resonances in the collisions between zeeman sublevels of the ground state . for such purpose ,",
    "a temperature lower than the present 65  @xmath4k would be preferred , to reduce the @xmath49-wave contribution , and to avoid temperature broadening of the resonance .",
    "although the temperature can be lowered by loading the atoms in very shallow traps , the achieved density is not large enough to perform accurate collisional measurements , and therefore methods for reducing the temperature of a dense sample are needed .",
    "in particular , we note that the axial degree of freedom of our trap is in the lamb - dicke regime ( @xmath84 ) , allowing for the application of fast degenerate raman sideband cooling @xcite , which would allow for an efficient reduction of the temperature without atom losses .",
