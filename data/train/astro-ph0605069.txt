    "massive binary stars are invoked as the progenitors of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena , from short and long gamma - ray bursts @xcite , type ib / c and blue type ii supernovae @xcite , to the fastest runaway o / b stars @xcite and the entire menagerie of binary systems with compact remnants : x - ray binaries , millisecond pulsar systems , and double neutron star systems ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "whether binaries are necessary for the formation of all such objects is a matter of debate .",
    "for instance , although many authors propose that type ib / c supernovae and short- and long - duration gamma - ray bursts are produced in binaries , it is still argued that their progenitors may be single stars @xcite .",
    "observational studies can contribute to this debate by measuring the frequency , separations , and mass ratios of close massive binary systems .",
    "although debates on the role of binaries continue , it is generally agreed that most of the progenitors of x - ray binaries and double neutron star binaries in the galactic disk must arise from massive binary systems",
    ". population synthesis models of these systems , however , adopt very different properties for the progenitors stellar components .",
    "these studies begin with four assumptions regarding the binary characteristics : the distribution of primary masses , the distribution of secondary masses , the distribution of orbital separations , and the distribution of eccentricities .",
    "population synthesis studies all choose some analytic form for these distributions , generally basing them upon observational constraints on the initial and final binary system parameters",
    ".    one significant source of disagreement in these initial distributions is the choice of the secondary star mass function .",
    "typically , the primary star mass distribution is chosen using a field initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary mass can be chosen through the same imf or , more commonly , from a distribution of the secondary - to - primary mass ratios : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . in this latter formalism ,",
    "the distribution is chosen to be proportional to the mass ratio to some power : @xmath19 between the limits @xmath20 .",
    "note that the power - law slope , @xmath1 , is not equivalent to the power - law slope , @xmath21 , of the secondary star mass distribution , commonly expressed @xmath22 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath23 is discussed by @xcite , and it is , in general , non - trivial .",
    "population studies disagree on the choice of @xmath1 , primarily because the choice of @xmath1 strongly effects the formation rate of key astrophysical objects .",
    "high values maximize the formation rate of double neutron star binaries whereas low values maximize the formation rate of low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "generally , population synthesis studies of low - mass x - ray binaries have assumed @xmath1 values near -2.7 @xcite , whereas studies of double neutron star binaries tend to prefer a flat distribution with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "resolving this ambiguity is important because the choice of this value can change formation rates of , for example , neutron star binaries by nearly a factor of 100 @xcite ! this is the difference between advanced ligo detecting 10 binary inspirals per year versus 1 inspiral in 10 years .",
    "the second critical parameter is the distribution of orbital separations , @xmath25 .",
    "this distribution is often taken to be a power law between some inner and outer limits , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 indicates a preference for large orbital separations and @xmath28 indicates a preference for small separations .",
    "observational studies of binaries have reached widely varying , even disparate , conclusions regarding these key parameters ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",

    "arguments abound over whether this @xmath35 peak is real or a selection effect arising from the fact that sb2s are only identified as such if the mass and luminosity ratios are near unity @xcite    several investigations have concluded that there are two populations of secondaries leading to a bimodal distribution of mass ratios . in summarizing data from the _ index catalog of visual binary stars _ @xcite @xcite and the 6th _ catalog of the orbital elements of spectroscopic binary stars _",

    "therefore , the distribution of orbital separations should be approximately log - normal as well , with a mean of @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "this result contrasts with others that indicate the distribution of orbital separations is flat in log space , @xmath57 , corresponding to @xmath58 ( i.e. , pik s law ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite report a flat distribution of separations among _ hipparchos _ common proper motion stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "estimates for the binary fraction , @xmath0 , among massive stars vary widely , and such estimates are always lower limits given that very close , very distant , and very low - mass companions are difficult to detect . here , we use @xmath0 to mean the fraction of all primary stars having exactly one secondary .",
    "we do not explicitly consider triple and higher order systems , even though @xcite report that a significant fraction of massive close binaries may have multiplicity @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite report binary fractions of at least @xmath61 , and suggest that the binary fraction may be close to 100% after corrections for incompleteness . among o stars in clusters and associations , @xcite report binary fractions of @xmath6226%  55% .",

    "75% for o stars in clusters and associations .",
    "@xcite tabulate multiplicity statistics for o stars in a variety of cluster environments , and they conclude that the binary fraction varies between @xmath6214% and 80% , with denser clusters having lower binary fractions .      despite a wealth of observational data on parameters of binary systems , there is little apparent agreement , leaving reasonable doubt as to whether the results are reconcilable .",
    "much of the disagreement can be explained by observational and sample selection biases .",
    "both spectroscopic radial velocity surveys and direct imaging surveys for companions of massive primaries become incomplete at low mass ratios below @xmath63 .",
    "secondaries in close , extreme mass ratio systems with massive primaries are presently undetectable with either technique and are likely to remain so in the near future .",
    "thus , estimates of @xmath0 , @xmath25 , and @xmath17 at low @xmath64 must be made by extrapolating some functional form of the distribution based on data from systems with larger @xmath64 and/or large @xmath65 .",
    "radial velocity surveys such as @xcite preferentially detect close , short - period companions ( @xmath66 @xmath56 ) while imaging surveys such as @xcite preferentially detect more distant , long - period companions .",
    "if the fundamental parameters of binaries are different for close versus distant binaries @xcite , then the variety of reported results might be partially understood in terms of these observational selection effects ( see fig  1 of @xcite ; also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , many studies do not explicitly describe the limits , @xmath4 , @xmath5 over which the results are valid , complicating comparisons between surveys .",
    "the statistics on companions to massive stars are especially uncertain as there have been few studies of massive binaries since the survey of @xcite . for",
    "massive primary stars , the small number of broad spectral features , coupled with rotational broadening , make radial velocity measurements difficult , and the @xcite sample may have missed binaries below velocities of 50kms@xmath67 .",
    "more than half of their sample consisted of double - lined spectroscopic binaries , thereby introducing a bias in favor of nearly equal mass components with large relative radial velocities . about half of the sample",
    "consisted of evolved o stars , selected on a magnitude - limited basis from throughout the sky .",
    "given the selection biases and lack of a common origin and age for this sample , the conclusions of @xcite may not apply to the general population of zero - age massive binaries .",
    "similarly , the conclusions of @xcite are based upon a small number of eclipsing systems in the smc , and are , therefore , most sensitive to systems of equal mass and radius so that no firm conclusions can be drawn @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze data from the radial velocity survey of 120 o and early - b stars in cygnus ob2 @xcite to help resolve these disparate conclusions regarding the binary characteristics of massive stars .",
    "the new data more than double the sample size of the @xcite study , include massive stars down to early b spectral types , and often involve more epochs of observations .",
    "although orbital parameters for a large number of systems are not yet available , we use the observed distribution of radial velocities , in conjunction with monte carlo models , to test several popular formulations of @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and @xmath25 from the literature @xcite . using only the raw velocities of a large sample of stars from one young ob association mitigates many of the selection and evolutionary effects responsible for conflicting results from more general binary surveys and catalogs @xcite .",
    "we find that we are able to constrain the probable values for @xmath1 and @xmath3 to a narrow region of parameter space , subject to reasonable assumptions about the boundary conditions of the mass ratios and orbital separations",
    ". only select combinations of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 can reproduce the levels of velocity variation seen in the data .",
    "some canonical parameterizations for binary characteristics are inconsistent with the data and can be ruled out .",
    "our immediate intent is to provide improved input parameters for population synthesis models that predict the rates of energetic phenomena in the milky way and at cosmic distances .",
    "we also expect that these results will have implications for the formation scenarios of massive stars which are currently under debate @xcite .",
    "@xcite report on a 6year radial velocity survey of 120 early - type probable members of the cygnus ob2 association .",
    "cygnus ob2 was chosen as a target for long term radial velocity study to determine the binary fraction and mass ratio distribution among massive binaries _ in a populous young ob association where the stars are of comparable age and stellar evolutionary effects are minimized .",

    "like podsiadlowski ( 1992 ) , we find that the primary formation path for type ib / c supernovae begins with a close binary where the more massive primary envelops its companion in a common envelope phase .",
    "the companion spirals into the envelope of the massive primary , ejecting the hydrogen envelope . after the common envelope phase",
    ", the primary will continue to lose mass in a wind . for this paper",
    ", we will assume any star that loses its entire hydrogen envelope has the potential to become a type ib / c supernova . because mass is lost in winds as well , even systems ( especially those at high metallicity ) that merge in the common envelope phase without ejecting",
    "the hydrogen envelope can make type ib / c supernovae .",
    "systems with more extreme mass ratios ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) are more likely to go through a common envelope phase and systems with such low - mass companions dominate the formation rate of type ib / c supernovae . figure  [ primary ] shows the range of primary masses and orbital separations that form ib / c supernovae for 4 separate values of the system mass ratio . as @xmath64 increases , the system tends to undergo more stable mass transfer without a common envelope phase . most of these systems do not become type ib / c supernovae .",
    "these simulations are based on our standard wind assumptions in which wind mass loss rates are set to 10% of the @xcite values . beyond 32m@xmath118",
    ", these primary star winds will also produce type ib / c progenitors , regardless of companion mass .",
    "however , this corresponds to only a small fraction of our type ib / c supernova rate .    the other requirement for a star to produce a type ib /",
    "c supernova is that it actually explode as a supernova .",
    "we assume any primary with an initial mass above @xmath119 will produce a supernova .",
    "although the total rate of type ib / c supernova does depend on this choice , the dependence on the type ii rate is nearly identical and varying this value in the @xmath120 range leads to variations in the rate of 2 - 3% for the bulk of our parameter study .",
    "we also assume that stars that have helium cores in excess of @xmath121 collapse directly to black holes and do nt form supernovae .",
    "varying this value of the helium core mass over the @xmath122 range yields variations in the rate of less than 1% .",
    "this is not surprising because the number of such high - mass systems is quite small .    in this paper",

    "if the stellar radii are smaller , we produce fewer common envelope systems with a larger fraction of the remaining common envelope systems leading to mergers prior to the ejection of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "this error dominates our 50% error .",

    "triple and quadruple systems probably exist among the sample , but they are likely to be a small fraction of all systems . among solar type stars the fraction of triple and quadruple systems is @xmath231 @xcite . the tertiary components , if any , are statistically likely to have wide orbital separations and long periods , making their observable dynamical influence minimal over few year time baselines and at @xmath1310 km s@xmath67  velocity precisions .",
    "we assume that the measured velocity variations are due to orbital dynamics of the primary star .",
    "stellar photospheric line profile variations may be present among some of the most massive stars , especially the evolved stars in our sample ( 31 of 114  or about 27% are post - main - sequence stars ) .",
    "line profile variations attributed to atmospheric pulsations are observed in @xmath23277% of evolved o stars and in some be stars @xcite but rarely among dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these phenomena could mimic the effects of bona fide orbital velocity variability in systems observed with sufficiently high spectral resolution to see these effects .",
    "neglecting this possibility would lead to an overestimate of the binary fraction and bias the conclusions in favor a larger @xmath1 and/or smaller @xmath3 .",
    "since our sample consists predominantly of dwarfs and non - be stars ( there are 35 be stars ) , the impact of line profile variations is minimal and is unlikely to dominate the results .",
    "finally , we caution that the binary characteristics within a single ob association may not be representative of the binary properties in other massive starforming regions . the fraction of binaries , the distribution of mass ratios , the initial orbital separations , and their eccentricities may depend upon the _ global _ conditions in the molecular cloud from which they formed .",
    "@xcite highlight a possible trend in the binary frequency with cluster density and richness .",
    "for example , the dense , massive molecular clouds with densities @xmath233 @xmath234 which can produce a super star cluster with @xmath235 @xmath14 within a diameter of a few pc @xcite may produce a different population of binaries than those which generate the relatively diffuse ob associations",
    ". this would be especially true if binaries result primarily from gravitational encounters between cloud cores and/or massive protostars early in the star formation episode .",
    "on the other hand , it might be argued that the production of binaries is primarily a _ local _ effect driven by physics on the scale of an individual cloud core ( @xmath135 @xmath56 ) .",
    "if massive stars form primarily through mergers of intermediate mass stars in a dense core as suggested by @xcite , then perhaps characteristics of massive binaries are set by the masses and separations of subclumps that fail to complete the merger process .",
    "@xcite provides a review of the predictions and consequences of competing theories for massive star formation .",
    "we have analyzed the radial velocity data spanning 6 years on a large sample of ob stars from the cygnus ob2 association to measure the probable system characteristics among massive binaries .",
    "we have compared the radial velocity amplitudes to expectations from monte carlo models based upon several popular formulations for the mass ratios distributions in massive binaries .",
    "these comparisons highlight the allowed parameter space and the sensitivity of the models to the key binary parameters : the true binary fraction , @xmath0 ; the power - law slope @xmath1 of the mass ratio distirbution over the range @xmath20 ; and @xmath3 , the power law slope of the orbital separations between the inner and outer radial boundaries , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the data improve upon prior studies by including a larger number of objects in a common association over more observational epochs .",
    "the sample also consists of a young population with a ( mostly ) uniform age of 23 myr , thereby minimizing evolutionary and selection effects inherent in many samples .",
    "1 .   descriptions of the massive binary mass ratio distribution and orbital separation distribution derived from spectroscopic and direct imaging studies are biased by selection effects and measurement limitations .",
    "these produce apparently conflicting prescriptions of massive binary parameters .",
    "power - law parameterizations require explicit boundaries over which the power law is valid .",
    "these boundaries are often insufficiently well specified in the published studies to allow meaningful comparisons given that the conclusions are sensitive to the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as shown in the figures herein .",
    "2 .   radial velocity amplitude data , such as we model here ,",
    "are consistent with a range of mass ratio distributions and orbital radius distributions .",
    "although the models are degenerate in @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the best fitting power - law slopes are correlated . under the assumption that the distribution of orbital separations is approximately flat ( pik s law @xmath238 ) ,",
    "the data allow only a narrow range of @xmath1 for given inner and outer radial boundaries .",
    "power - law parameterizations of @xmath17 and @xmath25 for plausible boundary values @xmath239 ,",
    "@xmath240 , @xmath131 , and @xmath9 are consistent with a mass ratio distribution described by @xmath241 assuming that @xmath242 , i.e. , the flat pik s law distribution of separations .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath243 reported for adaptive optics imaging studies of sco ob2 @xcite .",
    "best - fitting monte carlo models are , on average , consistent with the data at the @xmath2446070% level . agreement between models and data",
    "is limited by discrepancies between the cumulative distribution functions of the model velocity amplitudes and the data both at small velocities @xmath245 km s@xmath67  and at large velocities @xmath246 km s@xmath67  in roughly equal proportions .",
    "this result suggests that small sample size , measurement uncertainties , and the possible presence of higher - order systems in the data all act to preclude better agreement .",
    "power - law models with binary fractions @xmath152 fit the data slightly more poorly than models with @xmath9 , and they require larger mean mass ratios with @xmath247 . 5 .",
    "power - law models with binary fractions @xmath194 fit the data significantly less well , having @xmath248 .",
    "they also require extreme values of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath249 that are inconsistent with observational studies .",
    "the @xcite distribution of mass ratios ( @xmath188 for systems with @xmath250 and @xmath24 for systems with @xmath39 ) for @xmath129 and @xmath132 can reproduce the data at the @xmath251 level , comparable to the best - fitting power - law models with @xmath252 .",
    "this is because the two - component @xcite @xmath64 distribution effectively mimics a power law with slope intermediate between @xmath253 and @xmath168 .",
    "given the ad hoc nature of the this formulation , its additional parameters , and its inability to produce a superior match to the data , we find no reason to prefer it over a simpler power - law description for @xmath17 .",
    "secondary star masses drawn from a @xcite imf are inconsistent with the data unless the imf is truncated at low masses below @xmath1324 @xmath14 .",
    "imf truncation at such high masses is required to produce the levels of velocity variability seen in the data . _",
    "the implication here is that the physical conditions under which massive stars form are conducive to producing relatively close binaries with correlated component masses .",
    "mass ratio distributions involving both a twin component comprising 2540% of multiple systems and a power - law component with @xmath172 ( i.e. , flat ) for the remainder of multiple systems @xcite are inconsistent with the data unless the true binary fraction is @xmath254 .",
    "such low binary fractions are shown to be improbable",
    ". however , mass ratio distributions involving both a twin component comprising @xmath1340% of multiple systems and a power - law component with @xmath11 -2  -3 ( i.e. , salpeter - like ) are consistent with the data . 9 .",
    "secondary star mass distributions comprised of two components , a power - law component and a `` twin '' component with @xmath255 , provide good agreement with the data at the level of @xmath256 , marginally better than the best - fitting single power - law models .",
    "if the fraction of twin systems is @xmath257 and these secondaries have mean orbital separations @xmath258>=0.6\\pm0.6 $ ] , then the data are consistent with the remainder of the companions being drawn from the canonical miller - scalo -type field star imf",
    ". this formalism simultaneously predicts a type ib / c supernova fraction of @xmath1370.300.40 , consistent with the most recent estimates .",
    "_ this two - component description may allow for the production of massive binary phenomena such as the large number of double neutron star systems that seem to be required by the data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) while simultaneously permitting the production of low - mass x - ray binaries at the expected rates .",
    "the best - fitting binary parameters also predict that the fraction of core - collapse supernovae that are type ib / c supernovae is least 30% ( assuming single stars do not produce type ib / c supernovae ) . if the actual ib / c supernova fraction were 15% , the allowed binary parameter space would require binary systems where the two components were all nearly the same mass ( high @xmath1 ) and with orbital separations well above pik s law ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "such values , although possible , seem unlikely . more likely",
    "is that the binary observations indirectly support the most recent supernova observations suggesting that the ib / c supernova fraction may be as high as 3040% .",
    "observational work that better defines the distribution of binary separations , mass ratios , and binary fractions will help to reduce degeneracies in the types of model constraints used here .",
    "thereby , such data will allow a more precise specification of initial binary parameters .",
    "optical interferometric observations of companions to massive stars in the radial range @xmath260 @xmath56 would help verify that the pik s law distribution of separations extends to smaller orbital distances .",
    "such data may also begin to directly identify `` twin '' systems with typical separations @xmath131few  @xmath56 .",
    "the continuing cyg ob2 radial velocity survey @xcite will also measure orbital parameters , modulo inclinations , for a sizable sample of massive binaries with a common origin , permitting tighter constraints on the binary separations and companion masses .",
