    "interacting particles in confinement potentials are omnipresent in nature and laboratory systems such as trapped ions , e.g. @xcite , dusty plasmas , e.g. @xcite or ultracold bose and fermi gases @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of particle traps is that it is easy to realize situations of strong correlations .",
    "the observed particle arrangements reach from gas - like , liquid - like to solid behavior where the symmetry is influenced by the trap geometry .",
    "of particular recent interest have been spherical traps in which plasma crystals consisting of spherical shells ( yukawa balls ) are formed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the particle distribution among the shells is by now well understood @xcite .    in a recent study @xcite",
    "we have analyzed also the average particle density in the trap and found that it is very sensitive to the binary interaction : it changes from a flat profile in case of long - range coulomb interaction to a profile rapidly decaying away from the trap center in the case of a screened yukawa potential . using a non - local mean - field ( mf ) approximation the density profile could be computed analytically and was found to agree very well with first principle computer simulations for yukawa crystals .",
    "however , when the screening is increased deviations in the trap center kept growing which were attributed to correlation effects missing in the mean - field model .",
    "the goal of this paper is to remove these discrepancies . for this",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by including correlation effects following an idea of totsuji et al .",
    "@xcite applied to 2d systems .",
    "we apply the local density approximation ( lda ) using known results @xcite for the correlation energy of a homogeneous one - component yukawa plasma .",
    "the results clearly confirm that correlation effects are responsible for the strong density increase in the trap center .",
    "we find that lda with correlations included agrees very well with simulations of yukawa crystals in the limit of strong screening . on the other hand , for weak screening ,",
    "the previous mf result turns out to be more accurate .",
    "interestingly , for intermediate values of the screening parameter both methods are accurate , so a combination of both allows to quantitatively describe the density profile in the whole range of screening parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the lda and use it first to compute the density profile in a mean - field approximation , which , of course , gives worse results than mf , but helps to understand lda . then , in sec .",
    "iii we improve the lda model by including correlation effects . in sec .",
    "iv the results for the density profile are compared to molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "a discussion is given in sec .",
    "we consider @xmath0 identical particles with mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 confined by an external potential @xmath3 and interacting with the isotropic yukawa - type pair potential , @xmath4 . to derive the properties of interest we start with the expression of the ground - state energy , which is given by @xmath5=\\int d^3r\\ , u({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] with the energy density @xmath6 , where the mean - field energy density is @xmath7 the correlation contribution @xmath8 will be discussed below ( sec .",
    "iii ) by means of the local density approximation . before , we introduce this approximation and obtain first the lda results in mean - field approximation ( lda - mf )",
    ". these results will not be as accurate as the mf results , due to the applied approximation , but lda - mf helps to familiarize oneself with lda and its characteristics .",
    "the local density approximation is based upon the idea of replacing the non - local terms within the energy density at point @xmath9 by local expressions using the known energy density of the homogeneous system with its density @xmath10 equal to the local density @xmath11 of the true inhomogeneous system in question .",
    "therefore , to derive lda - mf we need to substitute for the non - local second term in , i.e. for the density of interaction energy , the corresponding expression of the infinite homogeneous system , which is given by [ details are given in the appendix ] @xmath12 and , as a second step , replace the homogeneous density @xmath10 by the local density @xmath11 .",
    "thus we obtain the lda - mf ground - state energy @xmath13=\\int d^3r\\ , u({\\bf r})\\ ] ] with the energy density @xmath14 the variation of the energy @xmath15=e^\\text{mf}_\\text{lda}[n]+\\mu\\biggl\\{n-\\int d^3r\\ , n({\\bf r})\\biggr\\}\\ ] ] with respect to the density @xmath11 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) yields an explicit expression for the density profile in an arbitrary confinement potential @xmath16 which holds at any point where the density is nonzero . due to",
    "this density is normalized by @xmath17    the case of an isotropic confinement @xmath18 , which is of particular interest , leads to an isotropic density distribution @xmath19 the outer radius @xmath20 of which is being fixed by the normalization condition which now becomes @xmath21 . in this isotropic case",
    "the yet unknown lagrange multiplier @xmath22 can be obtained by taking the variation also with respect to @xmath20 @xcite , which yields @xmath23    compared to the mf result which was given in @xcite , @xmath24 the lda - mf density differs in two points . on the one hand the laplacian of the potential @xmath25 is missing and , on the other hand , the expression of the chemical potential @xmath22 is simpler than @xmath26 .",
    "that is based upon the fact , that the missing expressions consist of derivatives and thus contain informations about contiguous values of the potential , what is suppressed within lda - mf and generally within lda .       and",
    "a constant screening parameter @xmath27 and three different particle numbers @xmath28 .",
    "also the result for @xmath29 , @xmath30 is shown by the dashed line .",
    "for comparison , the non - local mf results for @xmath31 , @xmath30 are given by the dotted lines.,width=323,height=226 ]    for the case of a parabolic external potential @xmath32 the density following from eqs .   and",
    "is @xmath33 the dimensionless combination @xmath34 , which contains the limiting outer radius , can be obtained from the normalization and is given by @xmath35{\\frac{15 ( n-1 ) q^2 \\kappa^3}{\\alpha}}\\\\           & = \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{15}{2}(\\kappa d_c)^3(n-1)}.      \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , we introduced the length scale @xmath36 , which is the stable distance of two charged particles in the absence of screening @xcite and which will be used below as the proper unit for lengths and screening parameters .",
    "as unit for densities we use the average density of a large coulomb system , which is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the results of are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldaresults ] for three particle numbers from @xmath38 to @xmath30 .",
    "one clearly sees the parabolic decrease of the density away from the trap center till it terminates in zero .",
    "the curvature of the density does not change by increasing the particle number - just the density increases continuously at every space point and , at the same time , extends to higher values of the limiting radius @xmath20 .",
    "however , the curvature of the density profile changes dramatically , when the plasma screening is increased at constant @xmath0 .    thus , in the case of an isotropic parabolic potential , the lda density profile bears qualitative resemblance to the density profile in the non - local mean - field approximation , although in the case of other confinement potentials the deviations of the lda - mf from the mf approximation are stronger , cf .",
    "eqs .   and .",
    "however , quantitatively in two points mf differs from lda - mf for parabolic confinement as well , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldaresults ] .    .",
    "the abscissa is normalized with the mf radius @xmath39 , while the ordinate is normalized with the corresponding mf density @xmath40 at the trap center.,width=323,height=226 ]    first , the density in this local density approximation does not show a discontinuity at @xmath41 , in contrast to the mf result , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : general_meanfielddensity ] , [ eq : general_meanfieldmu ] ) .",
    "this is due to the neglect of edge effects in this derivation of the lda result .",
    "secondly , lda - mf yields too small values of the density .",
    "this error is reduced ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ldacomparison ] ) with increasing values of the density parameter @xmath42 , cf .",
    "@xcite , which regardless of the factor @xmath43 solely determines the density profile .",
    "the reason for this improved behavior with increasing @xmath44 is due to the fact that an increase of @xmath45 contracts the effective area of integration within as well as within .",
    "the contraction finally is in favor of the accuracy of lda - mf , because the decreased integration volume contains a more homogeneous density .",
    "also an increase of the particle number @xmath0 , what flattens the density profile , will similarly improve lda - mf .    because the validity of the mean - field model depends on the value of the screening parameter @xmath46",
    ", there are the following two cases . in the first case , for small values of the screening parameter",
    ", the mf approximation provides a good description of the density profile , but lda - mf underrates this profile and so does not give a good description on its own .",
    "( that applies also if finite - size effects are included , cf .",
    "[ fig : lda - finitesize ] . ) in the second case , for large values of the screening parameter , the lda - mf approaches the mf approximation , however , there , the latter does not describe the density profile correctly due to the neglect of the now relevant correlation contributions @xcite .",
    "thus , the local density approximation of the mean - field energy alone does not give a good description of the density profile .",
    "however , it gives a straightforward way to include the missing correlation contributions in the energy density by usage of the result of the homogeneous system , see sec .",
    "[ section_correlation ] .      as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ldacomparison ] and from eq .   the density profile obtained by lda - mf breaks down in the coulomb case",
    "- the density can not be normalized anymore , which is the same as in the two - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "but the application of a local density approximation can not be the reason for this , because the method of lda is based upon the usage of results from the homogeneous system , and the coulomb system is homogeneous with @xmath47 n_c$ ] .     and",
    "@xmath48 calculated by lda - mf with ( fs corrected ) and without finite - size effects included . for comparison",
    "the exact mf result is also given by the dashed line .",
    "the difference between the finite - size correction and the partial finite - size correction is described in the text.,width=323,height=226 ]    in fact , the cause of the breakdown is the use of results from the infinite homogeneous system neglecting finite - size effects .",
    "this failure can be avoided by replacing by the corresponding expression of the finite homogeneous system . in the appendix such an expression",
    "is derived for isotropic confinement . as a result",
    "the finite - size effects lead to a corrected density profile @xmath49 instead of eq .",
    ", what indeed yields the constant mf solution also for lda - mf . as another example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lda - finitesize ] the density profiles with [ lda - mf ( fs corrected ) ] and without these finite - size contributions are shown for @xmath50 , @xmath48 .",
    "one clearly sees , that in the case of finite - size correction the density profile shows a discontinuity at the boundary and , due to that , it yields increased values of the density .",
    "however , the density profile including edge effects is not monotonically decreasing away from the trap center but has a density increasing part in the outer range , what is not correct .",
    "this is due to the spatial dependence of the denominator of eq .  .",
    "by contrast a more accurate monotonically decreasing density profile can also be obtained by taking the finite - size effects only partly into account [ lda - mf ( partly fs corrected ) ] , as derived in the appendix .",
    "the final result is given by @xmath51 which now misses the spatial dependence in the denominator .",
    "the corresponding result is also given in fig .",
    "[ fig : lda - finitesize ] .",
    "consequently , for yukawa systems like those analyzed here an improvement of lda is possible by including edge effects .",
    "however , for small values of the screening parameter even the improved local density approximation does not approach the degree of accuracy obtained by the non - local mean - field model , cf .",
    "[ fig : lda - finitesize ] . on the other hand , for increased screening the finite - size effects",
    "do not alter the density profile significantly .",
    "therefore , below we continue to use eq .   of the infinite homogeneous system , what will not interfere the following results .",
    "the energy expression @xmath52 ( [ eq : energy_lda],[eq : energydensity_lda ] ) contains only the energy density of the confinement and of the mean - field interaction . to include the contribution of the particle correlations we can make use of the result for the density of correlation energy of the homogeneous system which is given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath10 is the corresponding density of the homogeneous system . by replacing this density with the local density @xmath11 of the inhomogeneous system one obtains the correlation contribution of the energy density within lda .",
