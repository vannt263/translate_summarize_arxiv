    "the pump , or fundamental wave ( fw ) , experiences an effective spm from the cyclic energy transfer to the second harmonic ( sh ) .",
    "the advantage is that the effective cubic nonlinearity induced by the cascading process can be made self - defocusing because it is controlled by the sign of the phase - mismatch parameter @xcite , and therefore normal dispersion can be used to compress the fw .",

    "the delay is caused by the xpm term creating an intensity dependent self - focusing phase - shift in addition to the one already created by the kerr spm term .",

    "the compression limit does therefore not follow @xmath142 , but instead follows the characteristic raman - like time @xmath192 quite closely .",
    "indeed some physical explanation can be extracted from this parameter , since it namely represents the pulse duration , where the gvm length @xmath193 becomes shorter than the coherence length @xmath194 .",
    "intuitively it seems logical that the compressed pulse duration hit a limit when the gvm length is equal to the coherence length : the cascaded nonlinear interaction can no longer build up the phase shift because the gvm will remove the fw and sh from each other before even one cascaded cycle is complete .",
    "it is interesting to note that arguments similar to these were initially used to define the nonstationary regime @xcite , and it was already there clear that compression was limited in the same way as shown here .",
    "these studies were , as mentioned before , carried out in the nonstationary regime as defined by the nonlocal analysis , so the results corroborate each other .",

    "[ fig:1064-neff](b ) , decreases even beyond this point of maximum intensity .",
    "the explanation is that @xmath221 in ( b ) is determined by the compression factor @xmath222 alone , while the intensity in ( a ) is @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the compressed pulse quality relating the energy of the central spike to the initial pulse energy . around @xmath218",
    "the compressed pulse is quite close to the single - cycle regime .",
    "the time profiles for this case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1064-neff](c ) .",
    "the simulations without kerr nonlinearities ( so @xmath225 ) actually predict single - cycle compressed pulses , while turning on the kerr nonlinearities the compressed pulses are no longer single - cycle but increase to 1.5 optical cycles . notice also that the pulses with kerr nonlinearities are more asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry is caused by the gvm - induced raman - like perturbations [ 1st term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fh - shg - nlse - weakly - nonlocal ] ) ] as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "since this effect stems from the quadratic nonlinearities it must be stressed that they are also affecting the single - cycle pulses obtained without kerr nonlinearities .",
    "however , the difference is that there @xmath226 while with kerr nonlinearities @xmath227 must be chosen to have @xmath218 . therefore the strength of the raman - like perturbation , which scales as @xmath132 , is much stronger when including the competing kerr nonlinearities leading to a more asymmetric pulse .",
    "we also note that the simulations with exact dispersion ( no polynomial expansion , @xmath21 ) have fast trailing oscillations , which are absent for the tod simulations .",
    "the fw spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:1064-neff](d ) offer an explanation : only with exact dispersion is there a spectral peak around 3 @xmath228 m ; these are phase - matched dispersive waves .",
    "with tod the spectrum is instead smooth because the phase - matching condition for the dispersive wave is pushed far into the infra - red .    considering these results ,",
    "a brief discussion on the effect on tod in soliton compressors is fruitful . in fiber soliton compressors the most detrimental effect on pulse compression",
    "is the raman self - scattering term , that comes from a non - instantaneous kerr nonlinear response .",
    "as mentioned before , this effect can be neglected in nonlinear crystals .",
    "however , chan and liu showed that tod can severely distort the pulse when gvd is small @xcite , while for larger gvd the tod is less important for the pulse shape @xcite , and simply leads to a slowing down of the soliton . in this context the tod effect observed here , namely that the phase - matching wavelength of the dispersive wave is shifted , is completely different .",
    "we also remark that in our simulations tod is positive , and gvd is not small ( @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) .",
    "summing up , the gvm - induced raman - like distortions prevents efficient compression at high soliton numbers ( as previously found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the competing cubic nonlinearities aggravates this effect .",
    "in addition , the presence of a dispersive wave prevented soliton compression to the single - cycle level .",
    "the dispersive wave disappears when only including up to tod because the dispersion is no longer accurate in the region where the dispersive wave is observed , and this underlines the importance of including hod in the numerics .",
    "an interesting case to study would be when a large dispersion control is possible , such as with photonic crystal fibers @xcite .",
    "one could namely imagine that the dispersion could be engineered , so the phase - matching condition for the dispersive wave is pushed into the far ir - regime , allowing for further compression towards the single - cycle regime .",
    "to summarize we have shown that the limits to compression in cascaded quadratic soliton compressors can in most cases accurately be understood from a nonlocal model , which describes the cascaded quadratic nonlinearity as a nonlocal kerr - like self - phase modulation response .    in the stationary regime , where the nonlocal response is localized , one can not compress pulses beyond the width ( strength ) of the nonlocal response function .",
    "when increasing the effective soliton order to potentially compress beyond single - cycle duration , the numerical simulations indicated that competing kerr nonlinear effects were preventing single - cycle compressed pulses : since the quadratic soliton number must be chosen much larger than without kerr nonlinearities , this increases detrimental effects such as the gvm - induced raman - like perturbation found using the nonlocal theory .",
    "additionally it was found that higher - order dispersion can also prevent the observation of single - cycle compressed pulses . in particular , dispersive waves phase - matched to the compressed higher - order soliton caused trailing oscillations on the compressed pulse , eventually impeding further compression even at higher intensities .    in the nonstationary regime",
    "the nonlocal response function is oscillatory , and the convolution between the pulse and the nonlocal response function in the weakly nonlocal limit can elegantly be understood in the same way as in the stationary regime , except for an oscillatory contribution that causes trailing oscillations in the compressed pulse and severely degrades compression .",
    "the sh spectrum was found to be strongly red - shifted to a wavelength accurately predicted by the nonlocal theory .",
    "this spectral shift in turn induces a peak in the fw , which is the main compression limitation in the nonstationary regime .",
    "the compression limit was found to be the characteristic raman - like response time of the cascaded process @xmath155 , roughly the pulse duration for which the gvm and the coherence lengths become identical .",
    "another compression limit is set by the material kerr nonlinearity , which makes compression possible only below a critical phase mismatch parameter , and requires large soliton orders for successful compression .",
    "thus , higher - order effects ( xpm , higher - order dispersion and self - steepening ) come into play and detrimental nonlocal effects are increased . the xpm effects were accurately accounted for by using a corrected ( reduced ) soliton number .",
    "the present analysis will serve as a useful tool for further experimental progress in soliton compression using cascaded quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "we will now focus our attention to compression in a bbo at @xmath231  nm , because gvm is much stronger than what was presented here .",
    "thus we expect the nonlocal analysis to provide more insight into this case , in particular concerning the nonstationary regime , which is the dominating one at 800 nm ."
