    "_ beppo_sax  nfi observation started the same day at 16:20:14 ut , i.e. @xmath1 hours after the trigger time , and lasted 1.44 days .",
    "the net exposure time was 44609 s for mecs and 31280 s for lecs .",
    "two distinct uncatalogued x - ray sources are detected , one for each instrument .",
    "the source detected in the mecs has constant flux during the observation and its position is only marginally compatible with the wfc position of the grb . the lecs source ( 0.14 kev ) , though detected at low statistical significance , is visible only in the first half of the observation ; its position is fully compatible with the wfc one .",
    "optical / ir / radio searches did not detect any new source ( see gcn circulars 706 , 708 , 709 , 713 , 719 , 721 , 727 ) .",
    "the grbm ( 40700 kev ) light curve ( lasting @xmath4 s ) is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "1 . spectral analysis shows a softening during the burst with a power - law spectral index ( @xmath5 ) from @xmath6 ( rise ) to @xmath7 ( last part of the decay ) with an average of @xmath8 .",
    "the average flux in the 40700 kev band is @xmath9 erg  @xmath10 s@xmath11 , the peak flux is @xmath12 erg  @xmath10 s@xmath11  and the total fluence @xmath13 erg @xmath10 . the hardness ratio @xmath14 .    in the 228 kev wfc band ,",
    "the burst behaviour is quite different . at the time of the grb onset",
    ", the x - ray flux increases only slightly , while a major rise appears some 40 s later and lasts @xmath15 s. splitting the wfc band in the ranges 210 and 1028 kev we note that the prompt emission comes mainly from the hard band , while the delayed emission from the soft band .",
    "this effect , which is under study , can be attributed to scattering of gamma - rays to lower energies rather than to `` clean '' source photons .",
    "the 228 kev ( delayed ) flux is @xmath16 erg  @xmath10 s@xmath11 . in 210 kev",
    "it is @xmath17 erg  @xmath10 s@xmath11 .",
    "the follow - up _ beppo_sax  nfis observation showed , in the mecs energy range 1.64 kev , a soft and stable x - ray source ( @xmath18 level ) .",
    "an optimized source counts extraction radius of @xmath19 was used .",
    "figure 2 shows the smoothed image of the entire observation .",
    "the source coordinates are : r.a .",
    "= @xmath20 , dec = @xmath21 ( 1sax j1532.4 + 7349 ) . to be _ conservative",
    "_ , we can set an error circle of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "this position ( note it is @xmath22 away from that reported in gcn 707  @xcite ) could then be compatible ( offset @xmath23 ) with the wfc grb position .",
    "however its flux stability suggests it is not related to the grb .",
    "the average flux is @xmath24 erg  @xmath10 s@xmath11  in 1.64 kev .",
    "no significant emission is detected above 4 kev .    in the lecs ( 0.14 kev )",
    "a source is detected at @xmath25 level , but _ only in the first half _ of the observation .",
    "the smoothed images of the two halves of the observation are shown in fig .",
    "the position of this source is : r.a .",
    "= @xmath26 , dec = @xmath27 ( 1sax j1532.6 + 7348 ) , fully compatible with the wfc ( grb ) position .",
    "the low significance of the detection can not help in discriminating the source characteristics .",
    "unfortunately the low statistics leaves open several interpretations .",
    "in particular it is not clear if the mecs and lecs sources are really distinct and which ( if any ) is related to grb000615 .",
    "more sensitive observations of the field may help investigating the two detected sources .",
    "nevertheless , one can speculate that a soft prompt ( actually _ delayed _ ) x - ray event could lead to a soft afterglow .",
    "in brief , our refined data analysis shows that :    * a stable ( probably unrelated to the grb ) source is detected in the mecs",
    ". its spectrum can be fit by a power - law of index @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . * after @xmath30 hours from the gamma - ray event the x - ray afterglow is not detected to the limit of the mecs sensitivity suggesting a power - law temporal decay index @xmath31 ( respect to the wfc mean flux and @xmath32 ) . *",
    "a source is detected in the lecs band 0.14 kev ; some hint of decay is present ."
