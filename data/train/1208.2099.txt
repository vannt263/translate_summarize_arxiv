    "space astrometry missions such as gaia and jasmine are expected to reach a few micro arcseconds @xcite .",
    "moreover , high - accuracy vlbi is also available .    for visual binaries , formulations for orbit determinations",
    "have been well developed since the nineteenth century @xcite . at present , numerical methods",
    "are successfully used @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an analytic solution for an astrometric binary , where one object can be observed and the other such as black holes and neutron stars is unseen , has been found @xcite .",
    "the solution requires that sufficiently accurate measurements of the position of a star ( or the photo - center of a binary ) are done more than four times for one orbital period of the binary system .    for a close binary system with a short orbital period",
    ", we have a relatively large uncertainty in the position determination .",
    "for instance , the orbital period of cyg - x1 is nearly 6 days , which are extremely shorter than that of normal binary stars , say a few months and several years . because of such an extreme condition",
    ", it is interesting to seek another method in addition to the standard one .",
    "moreover , stars with planets also are another interesting target .    what can we do for orbit determination from position measurements with low signal - to - noise ( sn ) ratio ?",
    "it is expected that the position of the object is measured many times .",
    "the dense region of the observed points is corresponding to the neighborhood of the apastron of the kepler orbit , because the motion of the source star is slower according to the kepler s second law . on the other hand ,",
    "a region of fewer points is including the periastron , around which the source star moves faster .",
    "therefore , a statistical analysis including the variance of the measured positions and their correlation will bring the information about the orbital elements of the binary system .",
    "gedanken experiments suggest that the second moments are useful for exploring the shape of the orbit but they are not sufficient for the full orbit determination . at least the third moments seem to be needed .",
    "[ moment-1 ] and [ moment-2 ] .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this paper is to propose a method for orbit determination of an astrometric binary with low sn ratio by using the second and third moments .",
    "we shall provide also an exact solution for the coupled equations . as a result",
    ", the orbital elements of the binary are written in terms of the second and third moments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present a formulation and the solution in @xmath0 2 . in @xmath0 3 ,",
    "numerical tests are also done to see how reliable the analytic result is for practical cases taking account of observational noises .",
    "@xmath0 4 is devoted to conclusion . throughout this paper ,",
    "the spatial coordinates are the angular positions normalized by the distance to the celestial object .",
    "before projecting onto the celestial sphere , we consider a kepler orbit , where the semimajor axis and semiminor one are denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we choose the @xmath3 coordinates on the orbital plane such that the @xmath4-axis is along the semimajor axis of the elliptic orbit , the @xmath5-axis is along the semiminor one and the origin of the coordinates is chosen as the center of the ellipse .",
    "the orbit is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the eccentric anomaly .    by introducing the eccentricity @xmath8 , the semiminor axis becomes @xmath9    for an object in the kepler motion ,",
    "the time @xmath10 is related with the position @xmath7 through the so - called kepler equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the time of periastron passage .",
    "this equation represents transcendental equations in the sense that it can not be solved analytically without any approximation . in other words ,",
    "@xmath7 can not be expressed by using elementary functions of @xmath10 .",
    "this makes the inverse problem in astrometry difficult .",
    "we assume a plane perpendicular to the line of sight , where this plane is safely considered a small part of the celestial sphere because the angular position shift of extra - solar objects is sufficiently small .    a reference frame , which is used in astrometric observations , is described by the @xmath13 coordinates . as usual",
    ", the @xmath3 coordinates on the orbital plane and the @xmath13 coordinates on the reference plane are related through @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are defined as @xmath21 here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the longitude of ascending node , the argument of periastron and the inclination angle , respectively .",
    "[ config ] .    the ascending node and the descending one can not be distinguished by astrometric observations alone .",
    "therefore , both of @xmath25 for @xmath24 are possible . furthermore , this paper focuses on the moments , so that the clockwise and anti - clockwise motions can not be distinguished .",
    "two pairs of @xmath26 are possible .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the orbit is uniquely determined as shown below .",
    "let us assume frequent observations of the angular position .",
    "namely , we consider a large number of observed points .",
    "for such a case , the statistical average expressed as a summation is taken as the temporal average in an integral form as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the mean and @xmath29 denotes the total time duration of the observations .    in this paper , we focus on the periodic motion , so that the above expression becomes the integration over one orbital period .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath30 where we used eq .",
    "( [ kepler ] ) and @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider statistical moments .",
    "figure [ moment-1 ] suggests that the moments @xmath32 and @xmath33 are useful for distinguishing two different orbits .",
    "next , we consider the periastron for the orbit denoted by the closed solid curve . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that it is located at positive @xmath34 ( in the right hand side of the ellipse ) . for this case , the object moves faster around the periastron and slower around the apastron .",
    "hence , the dots in the figure schematically show asymmetry in the number of observed points . in order to distinguish such an asymmetry , the third moment such as",
    "@xmath35 seems useful because of the odd parity .",
    "figure [ moment-2 ] suggests that @xmath36 is needed via a gedanken experiment .",
    "the second moments are defined as @xmath37    the third moments are defined as @xmath38 the moments @xmath39 are actually observables .",
    "the vanishing of all the third moments leads to @xmath40 . in the following ,",
    "let us consider @xmath41 cases .    in the above second and third moments , the specific combinations among @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 frequently appear .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define new variables as @xmath42 by using the moments expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ mxx])-([mxy ] ) , the variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are rewritten as @xmath46    eq . ( [ i ] ) is substituted into eq .",
    "( [ mxxx ] ) to obtain a cubic equation for @xmath47 as @xmath48 this cubic equation gives three roots as @xmath47 by using cardano s formula . for saving the space , we do not write down the formula . in the similar manner ,",
    "we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ ii ] ) and ( [ myyy ] ) @xmath49 this provides @xmath50 , where its multiplicity is three .    at this point , we know both @xmath47 and @xmath50 , which can be substituted into eqs .",
    "( [ i])-([iii ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain the value of the variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in general",
    ", we get multi values for @xmath47 and @xmath50 . however , they are true solutions for eqs .",
    "( [ ekalpha ] ) and ( [ ekgamma ] ) , whereas not all of them satisfy the observed third moments .",
    "they have to satisfy the remaining set of the third moments as @xmath51 which can be used to pick up the correct @xmath47 and @xmath50 from multiple candidate values .    the definition of @xmath43 by eq .",
    "( [ i - def ] ) is rewritten as @xmath52 which tells us @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 @xmath53    it is obvious that the sign of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ alphapm ] ) must be the same as that of the left hand side , namely @xmath17 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the sign of @xmath17 is the same as that of @xmath47 that has been obtained above .",
    "this is expressed by @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the sign .",
    "therefore , the sign of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ alphapm ] ) is obtained uniquely as @xmath56 .",
    "( [ alphapm ] ) thus becomes @xmath57 what is the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ alphapm ] ) and ( [ alphapm2 ] ) ?",
    "( [ alphapm ] ) means two different equations because of @xmath25 in the right hand side , whereas eq .",
    "( [ alphapm2 ] ) is a _ single _ one .    for the later convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath58 as @xmath59 which is obtained from known quantities @xmath47 and @xmath50 as @xmath60 .",
    "we substitute eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) into the definition of @xmath45 by eq .",
    "( [ iii - def ] ) in order to delete @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain @xmath61 this is substituted into the definition of @xmath43 by eq .",

    "we obtain @xmath62 this is a function of only @xmath18 .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ delta - fn ] ) are substituted into @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ ii - def ] ) .",
    "after rather lengthy calculations , we get @xmath63 where we used eq . ( [ i - def ] ) for @xmath64",
    "interestingly , the right hand side of this equation consists of only the known quantities @xmath43 , @xmath44",
    ", @xmath45 and @xmath58 . therefore , we obtain the value of @xmath65 , which determines @xmath17 through eq .",
    "( [ alphapm2 ] ) .",
    "( [ beta^2 ] ) is solved for @xmath18 as @xmath66 unfortunately , we do not know @xmath67 contrary to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the sign of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ beta - sol ] ) is not uniquely determined .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath18 is two and hence that of @xmath20 is also two according to eq .",
    "( [ delta - fn ] ) .    up to this point , we know the value of @xmath17 and @xmath47 from observed quantities .",
    "we thus find separately @xmath8 as @xmath68 .",
    "it is crucial in the following procedure that the eccentricity @xmath8 is determined at this step .",
    "it is very inconvenient that @xmath18 and @xmath20 are proportional to the semiminor axis @xmath2 in their definition .",
    "we know @xmath8 , so that @xmath2 can be expressed by @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we define renormalized quantities as @xmath69 where we used eqs . ( [ beta ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) . we know",
    "the values of @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one can estimate @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "one can construct from four variables @xmath17 , @xmath70 , @xmath19 , @xmath71 , some quantities that are dependent on the inclination angle @xmath24 but not on any other angles @xmath23 nor @xmath22 .",
    "one example is @xmath72 another is @xmath73 these relations can be verified by direct calculations .",
    "note that @xmath74 must be positive because @xmath75 .",
    "this positivity chooses one pair of @xmath76 and reject the other pair .",
    "only the pair of @xmath77 is thus obtained . we know",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , so that @xmath78 and @xmath74 can be estimated .    by deleting @xmath79 from eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , we obtain @xmath80 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath81",
    ". apparently , two cases of @xmath81 are possible . however , this is not the case . by using newton s identities for eq .",
    "( [ cos2i ] ) , we obtain the identity as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the two roots for eq .",
    "( [ cos2i ] ) .",
    "the inequality as @xmath85 thus leads to the unique value of @xmath81 , because the other exceeds the unity as its absolute value .",
    "the single value of @xmath81 provides positive @xmath24 and negative one .",
    "they are corresponding to the ascending node and the descending node , respectively .",
    "they can not be distinguished by astrometric observations alone . in order to distinguish them ,",
    "radial velocity measurements for instance are needed .",
    "we get the value of the inclination angle . from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , therefore , the semimajor axis is obtained as @xmath86 this suggests that the value of @xmath1 is uniquely determined but not doubly .    in order to determine @xmath23 and @xmath22 ,",
    "let us consider other combinations among @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "direct calculations lead to @xmath87 the ratio of them is denoted as @xmath88 this is solved for @xmath22 as @xmath89 which gives the values of @xmath22 because we have already determined @xmath24 and @xmath90 . as mentioned already , both of @xmath91 are allowed .",
    "next , we consider different combinations as @xmath92 which can be verified by direct calculations . the ratio of them is denoted as @xmath93 this is solved for @xmath23 as @xmath94 which tells us the values of @xmath23 because we have already determined @xmath24 and @xmath95 . as mentioned already , both of @xmath96 are possible .    at most four values of @xmath22 are possible .",
    "similarly , the maximum multiplicity of @xmath23 is four . in total",
    ", sixteen sets of @xmath97 appear to exist .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath97 is reduced , because they must satisfy the definition of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 with the uniquely determined @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 include different combinations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 . basically , the sign of @xmath98 and @xmath99 has four types @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the apparent multiplicity sixteen is divided by four .",
    "in addition , it is obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ alpha])-([delta ] ) that the sign of @xmath22 depends on that of @xmath23 .",
    "the multiplicity is thus divided also by two . as a consequence ,",
    "we get only the two pairs of @xmath26 .",
    "one pair is corresponding to the clockwise motion and the other to the anti - clockwise one .",
    "the above formalism is discussed in an idealized world .",
    "numerical tests are done below to see whether the analytic result works for practical cases .",
    "first , eqs .",
    "( [ average1 ] ) and ( [ average2 ] ) assume that one can integrate observed quantities . in practice , however , observations are discrete , for which the integration becomes a summation .",
    "the integration and the summation could agree in the limit that the number of observations @xmath104 approaches the infinity . in a real world",
    ", @xmath104 is a large number but much smaller than the infinity .",
    "does the above formalism still give a reliable answer ?",
    "for investigating this point , we perform numerical simulations . according to the simulation for observations with equal time interval ,",
    "the above formalism recovers perfectly the orbital parameters for @xmath105 .",
    "next , we consider observation noises .",
    "the above formalism assumes that the observed points are located on an apparent ellipse . however , position measurements are inevitably associated with observational errors . therefore , we perform numerical simulations by adding gaussian errors into the position measurements as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 obey gaussian distributions with the standard deviation @xmath110 .",
    "we consider two cases : @xmath111 ( smaller case ) and @xmath112 ( larger one ) in the units of @xmath113 .",
    "table @xmath114 is a list of the orbital parameters that are recovered by using the above formalism .",
    "@xmath115 for simulated points in a @xmath116 simulation for @xmath111 and @xmath112 . for small observation error cases , the orbital parameters are well recovered . for large observation errors comparable to a half of the semimajor axis ,",
    "however , the recovered angles @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 are far from the true ones . on the other hand , the eccentricity @xmath8 and the semimajor axis @xmath1",
    "are recovered better than the angles .",
    "the semimajor axis is overestimated , because the simulated second moments apparently become larger than the true ones owing to such a large dispersion .",
    "we numerically study also different parameter values .",
    "they lead to similar results , for which numerical tables are omitted for saving the space .",
    "our numerical tests for the discreteness of observations and for the observation noises suggest that the above formalism derived for the idealized system could work in practice if observation noises are not so large .",
    "the previous analytical method can not guess orbit parameters for such large measurement errors @xmath117 , mostly because @xmath81 apparently becomes larger than the unity ( namely , the data points fit better with open orbits ) @xcite .    up to this point",
    ", we have assumed that the orbital period is known .",
    "what happens for unknown binaries ?",
    "we have made fourier analyses for numerically simulated points with time in fig .",
    "[ points ] . in the time domain ,",
    "the fourier spectrum has two peaks .",
    "one peak corresponds to the orbital period and the other is around the artificial time step in the numerical simulations .",
    "this suggests that the moment approach can be applied also to unknown binary systems , if a fourier analysis is adequately used to know the orbital period .",
    "namely , the present method could be used to search new binary systems .",
    "let us consider cyg - x1 , @xmath118 au at @xmath119 kpc from us .",
    "the expected angular accuracy in jasmine is @xmath120 microarcsec , so that the semimajor axis of cyg - x1 can become a direct observable .",
    "other known x - ray binaries seem too faint to be observed by jasmine .    a sun - like star at 20 pc with jupiter - like planet at 1",
    "au could produce a wobble of 0.001 au , corresponding to 50 microarcsec .",
    ", which must be an interesting target .      in the main part of this paper , we ignore the proper motion of the binary system in our galaxy .",
    "this is mostly because , for a close binary , the proper motion of the binary in our galaxy causes a larger cumulative displacement than the orbital motion of the component stars , though the orbital velocity may be larger than the proper motion . in advance , therefore , we know the proper motion before determining the orbital elements . for instance , it can be done by a comparison between the hipparcos data and the future space astrometry .",
    "if one wishes to determine the proper motion @xmath121 in the present formalism , however , the apparent positions should be replaced as @xmath122 and @xmath123 . by averaging the observed position according to eq .",
    "( [ average1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath124 where the terms of @xmath125 in the right hand side come from the kepler motion .",
    "hence the terms are nothing but a decaying term such as @xmath126 for the eccentric anomaly @xmath127 corresponding to @xmath128 .",
    "they become negligible as @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , the cumulative translation by the proper motion exceeds the oscillatory displacement by the kepler motion for a close binary .",
    "that is , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 . owing to this effect ,",
    "the decaying part due to the kepler motion goes away for a long observation period @xmath29 , say @xmath132 yr .",
    "the parts growing linearly in the observation time @xmath29 give the information about @xmath121 , provided @xmath29 is taken as a variable in the data analysis .",
    "if @xmath133 , the above extraction of the linearly growing part will be possible , especially for a short - separation binary .",
    "finally , we mention a mildly relativistic compact binary , in which the relativistic advance of the periastron occurs . rigorously speaking",
    ", we have to take account of the general relativistic equations . in practice",
    ", however , the above method may be applied .",
    "for instance , let us imagine two - year observations .",
    "for the first - year data , the periastron direction @xmath134 is derived .",
    "the second - year data tells @xmath135 .",
    "the difference between the first - year and second - year directions of the periastron suggests the periastron advance as @xmath136 .",
    "for instance , the hulse - taylor binary pulsar shows the large periastron shift rate @xmath137 deg . per year , though the angular orbital radius is a few microarcsec .",
    "and it is beyond the current measurement capability .",
    "this paper proposed a moment approach for orbit determinations of a close binary system with a short orbital period from astrometric observations alone . as an exact solution to the coupled equations ,",
    "the orbital elements are written in terms of the second and third moments of the projected position that is measured by astrometry .",
    "the moment formalism does not replace the standard method using kepler equation .",
    "it is safer to say that the present formalism is a supplementary tool for giving a rough parameter estimation , which can be used as a trial value for full numerical data fittings .",
    "it is interesting to make numerical tests of the present method .",
    "it is left as a future work .    in the moment approach ,",
    "the temporal information is smeared .",
    "therefore , the orbital period can not be determined by this method .",
    "another method such as the fourier analysis of position data with time ( in fig .",
    "[ points ] for example ) would give a characteristic frequency that is the inverse of the orbital period .",
    "fourier analyses recover the orbital period from numerically simulated data for fig .",
    "[ points ] .",
    "this suggests that the moment approach can be applied also to unknown binary systems , if a fourier analysis is adequately used to know the orbital period .",

    "<S> the orbital elements are written in terms of the second and third moments of projected positions that are measured by astrometry . </S>",
    "<S> this may give a possible estimation of the true orbit . </S>"
