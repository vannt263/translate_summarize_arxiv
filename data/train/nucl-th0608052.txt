    "the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction has played a key role in hypernuclear physics .",
    "it is known as the basic force which binds @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperons in hypernuclei . even in a conventional nuclear system ,",
    "understanding of the @xmath3 interaction is indisputably important if one introduces the strangeness degrees of freedom in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction , in order to extend the baryon - baryon interaction to a more unified picture demanded by su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "while performing @xmath3 scattering experiments is a daunting task , hyperon photoproduction on the deuteron appears to be a promising process for investigating the available @xmath3 interaction models .",
    "this is made possible by choosing some photoproduction kinematics where the outgoing baryons have small relative momenta and , therefore , the @xmath3 interaction is effectively strong .",
    "several previous studies have been done in inclusive and exclusive kaon photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite based on simple @xmath3 forces .",
    "nevertheless , all calculations indicated that significant @xmath3 final state interaction effects are present near the production thresholds .",
    "another motivation of performing experiments on the deuteron is due to the lack of the neutron target .",
    "experiments for kaon photoproduction on the proton have just been finished in elsa , jlab , and spring8 , resulting in a large number of unprecedented precise data that certainly need more sophisticated analyses . however , previous studies @xcite had indicated that neutron channels can provide a more stringent constraint to elementary models that can successfully explain the process on the proton .",
    "thus , kaon photoproduction on the deuteron can serve as a means for testing the available elementary models .",
    "to this end , a simple calculation has proven that in most kinematic situations the elementary cross section on the neutron can be reliably extracted from the deuteron cross section @xcite .",
    "a related experiment has recently been done at lns - tohoku by measuring the @xmath7 final states cross section and the collected data are being analyzed @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite , we have investigated the inclusive @xmath8 and exclusive @xmath9 photoproduction on the deuteron by using modern hyperon - nucleon forces and a certain kaon photoproduction operator .",
    "sizable effects of the hyperon - nucleon final state interaction were found near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 thresholds in the inclusive reaction .",
    "angular distributions for the exclusive process showed clear @xmath3 final state interaction effects in certain kinematic regions .",
    "we pointed out that precise data especially for the inclusive process around the @xmath1 threshold would help to clarify the strength and property of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "we notice that a fairly elaborate calculation focusing on rescattering contributions to the kaon photoproduction on the deuteron has recently appeared @xcite . in order to emphasize",
    "the influence of rescattering terms in the differential cross sections , the calculation , however , has been performed in a certain kinematics where final state interactions among the hyperons and the nucleon have negligible effects . a more detailed calculation , which includes the @xmath3 and @xmath10 rescattering terms , as well as a two - body photoproduction contribution in terms of a pion mediated process @xmath11 ,",
    "has also been performed @xcite .",
    "it is found that the latter gives the dominant contribution beyond the impulse approximation for backward kaon angles . in the forward directions ( @xmath12 ) the effects turn out to be small .    in this paper",
    "we theoretically examine in detail a number of polarization observables that are immediately accessible experimentally due to the high intensity continuous wave electron beams available nowadays at jlab , elsa , graal , and spring8 , and due to the hyperon recoil polarization , which can be directly obtained from the hyperon decay .",
    "this work is also greatly motivated by the hall a and hall b data recently taken which are currently being analyzed @xcite .    for the convenience of the reader",
    "we briefly describe the latest update of the elementary photoproduction operator in sec .",
    "section  iii describes the evaluation of the nuclear matrix element and the definition of various polarization observables .",
    "our numerical results for the various @xmath3 forces are extensively given in sec .",
    "iv and we give the conclusion in sec .  v.",
    "models for kaon photoproduction on the nucleon have been proliferating rapidly in recent years , due mostly to the continuously improving data base from experimental facilities like elsa , graal , and jlab .",
    "most of these descriptions employ an effective lagrangian approach at tree level @xcite where the results from coupled - channel calculations @xcite are taken into account .",
    "while the details of the model ingredients vary in the different studies , all models provide a good parameterization of the elementary kaon photoproduction data and are thus adequate for use in the nuclear environment .",
    "recently , we note that two new versions of data have just been published by the saphir and the clas collaborations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as reported in ref.@xcite , the clas data show substantial and systematic discrepancies with the saphir ones .",
    "thus , as a consequence , an attempt to fit the model to both data simultaneously would be meaningless .",
    "while waiting for a new method to reconcile this problem , and for the sake of comparison , we will in this study use the same operator @xcite we have used in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the operator consists of gauge - invariant background and resonances terms .",
    "the background terms include the standard @xmath13- , @xmath14- , and @xmath15-channel contributions along with a contact term required to restore gauge invariance after hadronic form factors have been introduced .",
    "the resonance part consists of three nucleon resonances that have been found in the coupled - channels approach to decay into the @xmath16 channel , the @xmath17(1650 ) , @xmath18(1710 ) , and @xmath19 . for the @xmath20 production operator further contributions from the @xmath21(1900 ) and @xmath22(1910 )",
    "@xmath23- resonances were added .",
    "in addition , we added the @xmath24 state @xcite found to be important in the description of saphir data @xcite .    in order to implement the operator in a nuclear matrix element , we rewrite the amplitude in an arbitrary frame    @xmath25 ~ , \\label{op1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the nucleon and hyperon masses , @xmath28 and",

    "the two - baryon final state state @xmath51 depends on @xmath52 , the ( nonrelativistic ) relative momentum of the final hyperon and nucleon , while the momentum transfer to the final state is denoted by @xmath53 . the elementary operator @xmath54 contains a label , indicating that it acts only on one of the baryons .",
    "the kinematics and the elementary operator are kept in their relativistic form , while nonrelativistic two - baryon wave functions are used .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated cross sections in the total momentum zero frame of the final two baryons .",
    "however , the nuclear matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ ic1 ] ) is not invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "the reason is the nonrelativistic treatment of the two baryons in the deuteron and the final state .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we calculate all observables in the lab frame ( the deuteron rest frame ) which corresponds to the experimental situation .",
    "the exclusive cross section is obtained by carrying out the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ ic1 ] ) in the lab frame ,    @xmath55    where the relative momentum @xmath52 is determined by the nonrelativistic relation @xmath56    the calculations of the nuclear matrix element are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , but eqs .",
    "( 3.13 ) , ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.15 ) therein should be replaced by the expressions in the lab frame ,    @xmath57    the inclusive @xmath58 cross section can be obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) over @xmath59 . however , this turns out to be inconvenient since the integration limits over @xmath59 are complicated and , secondly , the phase space factor appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) can become singular .",
    "we therefore take as the integration variable the direction of the hyperon momentum @xmath60 in the c.m .",
    "frame of the final two baryons .",

    "in addition to the inclusive @xmath58 and exclusive @xmath63 cross sections , we calculate the hyperon recoil polarization @xmath64 , the beam polarization asymmetry @xmath5 and the double polarizations @xmath65 , @xmath2 which are given by    @xmath66    in the definitions above , @xmath67 is the @xmath68 break - up amplitude @xmath69 with @xmath70 as the amplitude where the photon polarization points into the y - axis , @xmath71 , and so on .",
    "the photon polarization @xmath72 describes the helicity state + 1 .",
    "the beam polarization asymmetry @xmath5 is obtained with linearly polarized photon , while the double polarization observables @xmath65 and @xmath2 are the hyperon polarization along with circularly polarized photons .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the aim of this paper is twofold , i.e. , to study the @xmath3 final - state interaction ( fsi ) effects as well as to extract the information on the elementary amplitude in the region where fsi effects are negligible . for this purpose , we limit the outgoing kaon lab angles to the forward ones less than @xmath73 because we expect other types of fsi would start to show some effects for larger kaon angles . as a sample , the incoming photon energy of 1.3 gev is chosen throughout this paper .",
    "we analyze observables for two @xmath3 forces , i.e. , nsc89 @xcite and nsc97f @xcite , both of which give the correct hypertriton binding energy @xcite .",
    "the nsc89 interaction is a soft - core one - boson - exchange model based on regge - pole theory , and a straightforward extension of the @xmath6 model through the application of su(3 ) .",
    "the nsc97f model is an improvement of nsc89 .",
    "reference @xcite gives the six models from nsc97a through nsc97f classified by the different choices for the magnetic vector - meson @xmath74 ratio , which results in a different balance between @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath0 scattering lengths . among them only the two models , nsc89 and nsc97f , reproduce the hypertriton binding energy , but still have different @xmath77-wave scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "a rigorous four - body calculation @xcite has also shown that both of these two can not reproduce the bound states of @xmath78h and @xmath78he .",
    "thus , the present analysis is expected to supply additional information on the @xmath3 interaction via the continuum .",
    "the deuteron wave function is generated by the nijmegen93 potential  @xcite .",
    "some figures and discussions for the inclusive observables are similar to those which are already given in the previous paper @xcite , but we include them for the convenience of the readers .",
    "notice that we present all observables in the deuteron rest frame as mentioned in sec.iii , which differs from the former paper .",

    "[ fig2 ] we also see the fsi effects around the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 thresholds . around the @xmath1 threshold , the nsc97f result shows a prominent cusp - like structure , whereas the nsc89 one displays only a little deviation from the pwia result .",
    "this fact can be traced back to the location of the @xmath77-matrix pole for the @xmath0-@xmath1 system around the @xmath1 threshold , the full detail of which has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the structure produced by nsc97f with different @xmath0-@xmath1 partial wave contributions is enlarged in fig .",

    "<S> single and double polarization observables for kaon photoproduction on the deuteron are studied theoretically with modern hyperon - nucleon forces . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical region of the kaon scattered forward with large momentum is thoroughly investigated where either the quasifree scattering leading to the kaon and hyperon or the final - state interaction between hyperon and nucleon are expected . </S>",
    "<S> the quasifree scatterings show characteristic peaks in the inclusive cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the final - state interaction effects are significant , especially around the @xmath0 and @xmath1 thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> the double polarization @xmath2 is found to be sensitive to the final - state interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> precise data would help to clarify the property of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction and also help to extract the information on the elementary amplitude from the quasifree scattering region . </S>"
