    "the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory has detected pulsed signals from at least six rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. , for the crab pulsar , nolan et al .",
    "1993 , fierro et al .",
    "1998 ) . since interpreting @xmath0-rays should be less ambiguous compared with reprocessed , non - thermal x - rays , the @xmath0-ray pulsations observed from these objects are particularly important as a direct signature of basic non - thermal processes in pulsar magnetospheres , and potentially should help to discriminate among different emission models .",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere can be divided into two zones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sidev ] ) : the closed zone filled with a dense plasma corotating with the star , and the open zone in which plasma flows along the open field lines to escape through the light cylinder .",
    "the last - open field lines form the border of the open magnetic field line bundle . in all the pulsar emission models , particle acceleration and",
    "the resultant photon emissions take place within this open zone .    on the spinning neutron star surface , an electro - motive force , @xmath1  v ,",
    "is exerted from the magnetic pole to the rim of the polar cap . in this paper",
    ", we assume that both the spin and magnetic axes reside in the same hemisphere ; that is , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the rotation vector , and @xmath4 the stellar magnetic moment vector .",
    "this strong emf causes the magnetospheric currents that flow outwards in the lower latitudes and inwards near the magnetic axis ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] ) .",
    "the return current is formed at large - distances where poynting flux is converted into kinetic energy of particles or dissipated ( shibata  1997 ) .",
    "attempts to model the particle accelerator have traditionally concentrated on two scenarios : polar - cap models with emission altitudes of @xmath5 cm to several neutron star radii over a pulsar polar cap surface ( harding , tademaru , & esposito 1978 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; dermer & sturner 1994 ; sturner , dermer , & michel 1995 ) , and outer - gap models with acceleration occurring in the open zone located near the light cylinder ( cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b , hereafter chr86a , b ; chiang & romani 1992 , 1994 ; romani and yadigaroglu 1995 ) .",
    "both models predict that electrons and positrons are accelerated in a charge depletion region , a potential gap , by the electric field along the magnetic field lines to radiate high - energy @xmath0-rays via the curvature and inverse - compton ( ic ) processes .    in the outer magnetosphere picture of romani ( 1996 ) , he estimated the evolution of high - energy flux efficiencies and beaming fractions to discuss the detection statistics , by considering how pair creation on thermal surface flux can limit the acceleration zones .",
    "subsequently , cheng , ruderman and zhang ( 2000 , hereafter crz00 ) developed a three - dimensional outer magnetospheric gap model , self - consistently limiting the gap size by pair creation from collisions of thermal photons from the polar cap that is heated by the bombardment of gap - accelerated charged particles .",
    "the outer gap models of these two groups have been successful in explaining the observed light curves , particularly in reproducing the wide separation of the two peaks commonly observed from @xmath0-ray pulsars ( kanbach 1999 ; thompson 2001 ) , without invoking a very small inclination angle . in these outer gap models ,",
    "they consider that the gap extends from the null surface , where the goldreich - julian charge density vanishes , to the light cylinder , beyond which the velocity of a co - rotating plasma would exceed the velocity of light , adopting the vacuum solution of the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential ( chr86a ) .",
    "however , it was analytically demonstrated by hirotani , harding , and shibata ( 2003 , hhs03 ) that an active gap , which must be non - vacuum , possesses a qualitatively different properties from the vacuum solution discussed in traditional outer - gap models .",
    "for example , the gap inner boundary shifts towards the star as the created current increases and at last touch the star if the created current exceeds the goldreich - julian ( gj ) value at the surface . therefore , to understand the particle accelerator , which extends from the stellar surface to the outer magnetosphere , we have to merge the outer - gap and polar - cap models , which have been separately considered so far .",
    "in traditional polar - cap models , the energetics and pair cascade spectrum have had success in reproducing the observations . however , the predicted beam size of radiation emitted near the stellar surface is too small to produce the wide pulse profiles that are observed from high - energy pulsars . seeking",
    "the possibility of a wide hollow cone of high - energy radiation due to the flaring of field lines , arons ( 1983 ) first examined the particle acceleration at the high altitudes along the last open field line .",
    "this type of accelerator , or the slot gap , forms because the pair formation front ( pff ) , which screens the accelerating electric field , @xmath6 , in a width comparable to the neutron star radius , occurs at increasingly higher altitude as the magnetic colatitude approaches the edge of the open field region ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) .",
    "muslimov and harding ( 2003 , hereafter mh03 ) extended this argument by including two new features : acceleration due to space - time dragging , and the additional decrease of @xmath6 at the edge of the gap due to the narrowness of the slot gap .",
    "moreover , muslimov and harding ( 2004a , b , hereafter mh04a , b ) matched the high - altitude slot gap solution for @xmath6 to the solution obtained at lower altitudes ( mh03 ) , and found that the residual @xmath6 is small and constant , but still large enough at all altitudes to maintain the energies of electrons , which are extracted from the star , above 5  tev .",
    "it is noteworthy that the polar - slot gap model proposed by mh04a , b is an extension of the polar - cap model into the outer magnetosphere , assuming that the plasma flowing in the gap consists of only one sign of charges .",
    "this assumption is self - consistently satisfied in their model , because pair creation in the extended slot gap occurs at a reduced rate and the pair cascade due to inward - migrating particles does not take place . in the polar - slot gap model ,",
    "the completely charge - separated , space - charge - limited flow ( sclf ) leads to a negative @xmath6 for @xmath2 .",
    "however , we should notice here that the electric current induced by the negative @xmath6 ( right panel of figure  [ fig : current ] ) contradicts with the global current patterns ( left panel of figure  [ fig : current ] ) , which is derived by the emf exerted on the spinning neutron - star surface , if the gap is located near the last - open field line .",
    "( note that the return current sheet is not assumed on the last - open field line in the slot gap model . ) on these grounds , we are motivated by the need to contrive an accelerator model that predicts a consistent current direction with the global requirement .",
    "to this aim , it is straightforward to extend recent outer - gap models , which predict opposite @xmath6 to polar - cap models , into the inner magnetosphere . extending the one - dimensional analysis along the field lines in several outer - gap models ( hirotani and shibata 1999a ,  b ,  c ;",
    "hhs03 ) , takata , shibata , and hirotani ( 2004 , hereafter tsh04 ) and takata et al . ( 2006 , hereafter tshc06 ) solved the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential on the two - dimensional poloidal plane , and revealed that the gap inner boundary is located inside of the null surface owing to the pair creation within the gap , assuming that the particle motion immediately saturates in the balance between electric and radiation - reaction forces .    in the present paper , we extend tsh04 and tshc06 by solving the particle energy distribution explicitly , and by considering a super - gj current solution with ion emission from the neutron star surface . in   [ sec : basic_eqs ] , we formulate the basic equations and boundary conditions .",
    "we then apply it to the crab pulsar in   [ sec : appl ] , and compare the solution with mh04 in ",

    ", @xmath387 does not have to be greater than @xmath388 , in order to screen @xmath6 .",
    "in short , the gap has a hybrid structure : the lower latitudes ( with small @xmath340 ) are nearly vacuum having sub - gj current densities and the inner boundary is located slightly inside of the null surface , because @xmath297 region will be filled with the electrons emitted from the stellar surface . the higher latitudes , on the other hand , are non - vacuum having super - gj current densities , and the inner boundary is located at the stellar surface , extracting ions at the rate such that their non - relativistic column density at the stellar surface cancels the strong @xmath6 induced by the negative @xmath389 of relativistic electrons , positrons , and ions .",

    "let us see the pitch angle evolution of the electrons , which is presented by the right panel of figure  [ fig : fn70e1 ] .",
    "in the outer part of the gap , the electrons are created by the collisions between the outward - directed @xmath0-rays and the surface x - rays .",

    "since such inward - created electrons do not change their migration direction , their pitch angles are greater than those of the outward - created ones , as the dotted curve demonstrates .",
    "as the electrons migrate inwards , they lose perpendicular momenta via synchro - curvature radiation in the strong @xmath124 field , reducing their pitch angles , as the dotted , dash - dotted , and dashed curves indicate .",
    "we should point out that a pure curvature formula can not be applied to the electrons .",
    "for example , at @xmath502 , the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : fn70e1 ] demonstrates that electrons have @xmath503 and @xmath504 .",

    "only when the gap is formed along most of the open field lines ( i.e. , @xmath522 ) , @xmath523 can be of the order of unity . since the second factor in equation  ( [ eq : sigmal ] ) does not change significantly for different values of parameters except for @xmath324 , @xmath523",
    "solely depends on @xmath324 . substituting @xmath524 , @xmath525 , @xmath526 in @xmath527 for @xmath325 , @xmath528 , and @xmath529",

    "positrons escape from the gap with @xmath485 , while ions with @xmath531 .",
    "to conclude , we investigated the self - consistent electrodynamic structure of a particle accelerator in the crab pulsar magnetosphere on the two - dimensional surface that contains the magnetic field lines threading the stellar surface on the plane in which both the rotation and magnetic axes reside .",
    "we regard the trans - field thickness , @xmath324 , of the gap as a free parameter , instead of trying to constrain it . for a small @xmath324 ,",
    "the created current density , @xmath180 , becomes sub - goldreich - julian , giving the traditional outer - gap solution but with negligible @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "however , as @xmath324 increases , @xmath180 increases to become super - gj , giving a new gap solution with substantially screened acceleration electric field , @xmath6 , in the inner part . in this case",
    ", the gap extends towards the neutron star with a small - amplitude positive @xmath6 , which extracts ions from the stellar surface .",
    "it is essential to examine the pitch - angle evolution of the created particles , because the inward - migrating particles emit @xmath0-rays , which governs the gap electrodynamics through pair creation , via synchro - curvature process rather than pure - curvature one .",
    "the resultant spectral shape of the outward - directed @xmath0-rays is consistent with the existing observations ; however , their predicted fluxes appear insufficient .",
    "the pulsar wind at the light cylinder is magnetically dominated : along the field lines threading the gap , magnetization parameter , @xmath523 , is about @xmath532 .",
    "the obtained @xmath0-ray fluxes in the present work , are all below the observed values .",
    "nevertheless , this problem may be solved if we extend the current analysis into a three - dimensional configuration space . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : boltz_gamm ] , we assume @xmath222 and neglect the aberration of photon emission directions . however , in a realistic three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere , @xmath0-rays will have angular momenta and may be emitted in a limited solid angle as suggested by the caustic model ( e.g. , dyks & rudak  2003 ; dyks , harding , & rudak 2004 ) , which incorporate the effect of aberration of photons and that of time - of - flight delays . in particular , in the trailing peak of a highly inclined rotator , photons emitted at different altitudes @xmath62 will be beamed in a narrow solid angle to be piled up at the same phase of a pulse ( morini  1983 ; romani & yadigaroglu  1995 ) , resulting in a @xmath0-ray flux which is an order of magnitude greater than the present values .",
    "thus , the insufficient @xmath0-ray fluxes does not suggest the inapplicability of the present method .",
    "it is noteworthy that the meridional propagation angles of the emitted photons ( e.g. , different curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : c70s1 ] , [ fig : c70s2 ] , and [ fig : incl ] ) can be readily translated into the emissivity distribution in the gap as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , in this work , we do not sum up the @xmath0-ray fluxes emitted into different meridional angles taking account of the aberration of light .",
    "let us discuss the electrodynamic stability of the gap , by considering whether an initial perturbation of some quantity tends to be canceled or not . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider that the soft photon field is given and unchanged when gap quantities vary .",
    "thus , let us first consider the case when the soft photon field is fixed .",
    "imagine that the created pairs are decreased as an initial perturbation .",
    "it leads to an increase of the potential drop due to less efficient screening by the discharged pairs , and hence to an increase of particle energies .",
    "then the particles emit synchro - curvature radiation efficiently , resulting in an increase of the created pairs , which tends to cancel the initial decrease of created pairs .",
    "let us next consider the case when the soft photon field also changes .",
    "imagine again that the created pairs are decreased as an initial perturbation .",
    "it leads to an increase of particle energies in the same manner as discussed just above .",
    "the increased particle energies increase not only the number and density of synchro - curvature @xmath0-rays , but also the surface blackbody emission from heated polar caps and the secondary magnetospheric x - rays . even though neither the heated polar - cap emission nor the magnetospheric emission are taken into account as the soft photon field illuminating the gap in this paper , they all work , in general , to increase the pair creation within the gap , which cancels the initial decrease of created pairs more strongly than the case of the fixed soft photon field .",
    "because of such negative feedback effects , solution exists in a wide parameter space .",
    "for example , the created current density is almost unchanged for a wide range of @xmath324 ( e.g. , compare the dash - dotted and dash - dot - dot - dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : c70d ] ) . on these grounds , although the perturbation equations are not solved under appropriate boundary conditions for the perturbed quantities , we conjecture that the particle accelerator is electrodynamically stable , irrespective whether the x - ray field illuminating the gap is thermal or non - thermal origin .",
    "let us briefly look at the relationship between the locally determined current density @xmath181 ( eq .  [ [ eq : jgap ] ] ) and the globally required one , @xmath533 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath533 is constrained independently from the gap electrodynamics by the dissipation at large distances ( shibata  1997 ) , which provides the electric load in the current circuit , or by the condition that the magnetic flux function should be continuous across the light cylinder , as discussed in recent force - free argument of the trans - field equation ( contopoulos , kazanas , fendt 1999 ; goodwin et al .",
    "2004 ; gruzinov 2005 ; spitkovsky 2006 ) . in either case",
    ", @xmath533 will be more or less close to unity ( i.e. , typical gj value ) .",
    "on the other hand , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : supergj ] , for super - gj cases , @xmath181 is automatically regulated around @xmath534 for a wide parameter range .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between @xmath181 and @xmath533 is small provided that @xmath324 is large enough to maintain the created current density at a super - gj value .",
    "the small imbalance @xmath535 may have to be compensated by a current injection across the outer boundary ( if the gap terminates inside of the light cylinder , charged particles could be injected from the outer boundary ) , or by an additional ionic emission from the stellar surface ( if the imbalance leads to an additional residual @xmath6 at the surface ) . in any case , the injected current is small compared with @xmath181 ; thus , it will not change the electrodynamics significantly , even though the gap active region may be shifted to some degree along the magnetic field lines , as demonstrated by hirotani and shibata ( 2001a , b ; 2002 ) , tsh04 , and tshc06 .",
    "let us devote a little more space to examining the particle flux along the open field lines that do _ not _ thread the gap ( i.e. , @xmath536 ) .",
    "since @xmath6 vanishes , the created , secondary pairs emit synchrotron photons , which are capable of cascading into tertiary and higher - generation pairs by @xmath0-@xmath0 or @xmath0-b collisions . examining the cascade , we can calculate the rate of pair creation , which takes place mainly in the inner magnetosphere . denoting that the pair creation rate is @xmath537 per unit area per second , we find @xmath538 , @xmath539 , @xmath540 , @xmath541 , @xmath542 , @xmath543 , @xmath544 , @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 , @xmath544 at @xmath548 , @xmath549 , @xmath550 , @xmath551 , @xmath552 , @xmath553 , @xmath554 , @xmath555 , @xmath556 , @xmath557 , and @xmath558 , respectively , for @xmath325 , @xmath559 , and @xmath451 .",
    "thus , the averaged creation rate becomes @xmath560 pairs per unit area per second , giving @xmath561 as the pair creation rate in the entire magnetosphere .",
    "it should be noted that this @xmath562 appears less than the constraints that arise from consideration of magnetic dissipation in the wind zone ( kirk & lyubarsky  2001 , who derived @xmath563 ) , and of crab nebula s radio synchrotron emission ( arons 2004 , who derived @xmath564 ) .    due to strong synchrotron radiation",
    ", these inwardly created particles quickly lose energy to fall onto the lowest landau level , preserving longitudinal momentum @xmath565 per particle .",
    "these non - relativistic particles possess momentum flux of @xmath566 , where @xmath567 denotes the polar cap radius . on the other hand ,",
    "surface x - ray field has the upward momentum flux of @xmath568 .",
    "thus , the created pairs will not be pushed back by resonant scatterings .",
    "they simply fall onto the stellar surface with non - relativistic velocities .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath569-@xmath570 annihilation line is about @xmath571 , which is negligible ( e.g. , compared with the @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath572 ) . on these grounds , for the crab - pulsar , we must conclude that the present work fails to explain the injection rate of the wind particles , in the same way as in other outer - gap models .",
    "it is worth comparing the present results with the polar - slot - gap model proposed by muslimov and harding ( 2003 ; mh04a ; mh04b ) , who obtained a quite different solution ( e.g. , negative @xmath6 in the gap ) solving essentially the same equations under analogous boundary conditions for the same pulsar as in the present work .",
    "the only difference is the transfield thickness of the gap . estimating the transfield thickness to be @xmath573 , which is a few hundred times thinner than the present work",

    "because of this very small @xmath574 , emitted @xmath0-rays do not efficiently materialize within the gap ; as a result , the created and returned positrons from the higher altitudes do not break down the original assumption of the completely - charge - separated sclf near the stellar surface .    to avoid the reversal of @xmath6 in the gap ( from negative near the star to positive in the outer magnetosphere ) , or equivalently , to avoid the reversal of the sign of the effective charge density , @xmath575 , along the field line , mh04a and",
    "mh04b assumed that @xmath576 nearly vanishes and remains constant above a certain altitude , @xmath577 , where @xmath578 is estimated to be within a few neutron star radii .",
    "because of this assumption , @xmath6 is suppress at a very small value and the pair creation becomes negligible in the entire gap . in another word , the enhanced screening is caused not only by the proximity of two conducting boundaries , but also by the assumption of @xmath579 within the gap ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : chr ] ] ) . to justify this @xmath364 distribution ,",
    "mh04a and mh04b proposed an idea that @xmath28 should grow by the _",

    "if @xmath593 holds in the outer magnetosphere , @xmath576 could be a small positive constant by the cross - field motion of charges ( without pair creation ) ; in this case , the current is slightly sub - gj with electron emission from the neutron star surface , as mh04a , b suggested . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath594 holds in the outer magnetosphere , @xmath576 takes a small negative value by the discharge of the created pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : c70nine ] ) ; in this case , the current is super - gj with ion emission from the surface , as demonstrated in the present paper . since no studies have ever successfully constrained the gap transfield thickness , there is room for further investigation on this issue .",
