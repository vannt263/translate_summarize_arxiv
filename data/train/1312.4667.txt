    "recent experimental realizations of systems of ultracold atoms prepared in excited bloch bands in optical lattices have opened new prospects in ultracold atomic science  @xcite .",
    "this access to the orbital degree of freedom allows to observe new exotic physics by playing with the anisotropy of the wannier functions from which the bloch states of the excited bands are built . in particular , they can possess new quantum degeneracies associated with the symmetries of the system  @xcite .",
    "the population of the excited levels was also shown to be important in the study of the simplest building block of an optical lattice , the double well . here",
    ", the excited levels are responsible for enhancing the tunneling of atoms through the barrier  @xcite , which is a process that has been suggested for the creation of macroscopic superposition states with orbital degrees of freedom and two - qubit phase gates  @xcite .",
    "also , the josephson effect between different orbital states within the same region of space was predicted to exist in externally driven condensates  @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms in double wells have been thoroughly studied in the framework of two - mode models , both with an eye towards unveiling josephson physics  @xcite and as a candidate system to observe macroscopic atomic quantum superpositions  @xcite . in this manuscript",
    ", we introduce a semiclassical approach that allows one to study effects on the double - well condensate dynamics stemming from a finite population of the excited single - particle states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dw ] ) .",
    "we study the situation where the presence of excited states yields a simplified model for the effect of dissipation on the collective dynamics of atoms oscillating coherently between the ground states of the two wells .",
    "we also consider the physically realizable case where a significant part of the gas is intentionally excited to the higher lying states .     and @xmath0 are represented .",
    "the @xmath1 terms ( @xmath2 ) indicate the tunneling energy in each level .",
    "the @xmath3 terms represent the interaction energy in each level .",
    "the @xmath4 term is the inter - level interaction energy . ]",
    "two - mode approaches are conventionally used to model ultracold bosons in double wells @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters in such a model are the tunneling energy @xmath5 and the interaction energy @xmath6 , together with the total number of atoms @xmath7 . according to which energy dominates",
    "one can identify three main regimes @xcite .",
    "for the rabi regime ( @xmath8 ) , macroscopic tunneling of essentially independent atoms between both wells is predicted .",
    "increasing the atom - atom interaction ( @xmath9 ) , the system will enter the josephson regime in which , for certain initial conditions , macroscopic self - trapping is possible  @xcite .",
    "finally , the fock regime is reached ( @xmath10 ) , in which semiclassical approaches cease to be adequate .",
    "several methods exists that allow to theoretically treat the double well : the semiclassical approximation maps its dynamics onto a non - rigid pendulum  @xcite and in the strong correlation regime direct diagonalization of the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( originally called the lipkin - meshkov - glick hamiltonian in nuclear physics  @xcite ) can be undertaken .",
    "the correspondence between the exact two - mode many - boson hamiltonian and the semiclassical approach can be elucidated by means of a phase - space distribution function . in this context , the husimi distribution function has been used to express the quantum results in a semiclassical language  @xcite .",
    "an interesting outcome is that , while in the josephson regime the quantum approach always maintains the parity of the hamiltonian , the semiclassical approach breaks that symmetry , allowing in particular for the phenomenon of macroscopic self - trapping  @xcite .",
    "one of the numerical methods that have successfully been used to study this system within the quantum approach is , for example , the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree methods ( mctdh )  @xcite .",
    "here we extend the two - mode model to include two additional excited modes .",
    "this extension is motivated by several reasons .",
    "it is a first step towards a complete interpolation between two limits in the dynamics of @xmath7 atoms ( with @xmath7 large ) : ( i ) the dimension of the one - atom hilbert space is two ( which amounts to an @xmath7-body extension of the two - level system ) , and ( ii ) the dimension is @xmath11 ( which resembles the problem of ultracold atoms in optical lattices ) . on the other hand",
    ", it will allow us to test the validity and limits of the common two - mode approach in more detail .",
    "it will also help in benchmarking the more exact but numerically demanding mctdh approach .",
    "another important motivation for this work is the goal of mimicking the effect of dissipation through the existence of higher lying states into which the atoms can be excited , in what could be viewed as a toy model of the depletion cloud .",
    "we will argue that some aspects of real dissipation can already be explored within this simplified description .",
    "finally , a further motivation is to show that the presence of higher modes can lead to new double - well dynamics which is interesting in its own right .",
    "particularly , we will see that the short time dynamics of the excited modes can be manipulated by means of the initial population imbalance of the ground modes .",
    "this is quite relevant for the current state of the art , as recent experimental progress has shown that it is possible to invert the populations in a single well ( see refs .  ) .",
    "the semiclassical limit is described by two non - rigid pendula for which the canonically conjugate variables are the population imbalances and phase differences between left and right wells for both the ground and excited modes .",
    "these pendula are coupled by a third pendulum , for which the canonically conjugate variables are number and phase difference between the total populations ( i.e. , summed over the two wells ) in the excited and ground modes .",
    "this latter pendulum stems from the local interaction that transfers atoms between the ground and the excited modes . in the rabi regime ,",
    "the dynamics of the first two pendula is similar to that of two uncoupled pendula .",
    "by contrast , the population imbalance associated to the third pendulum remains constant , while the corresponding phase grows unbounded .",
    "this aspect of the non - interacting picture remains qualitatively valid in the josephson regime for a considerable time during which the population imbalance between ground and excited modes remains approximately constant .",
    "we note , however , that actual fixed points for this third pendulum exist only in the fock regime , which lies outside the limits of applicability of the semiclassical model .",
    "indeed , the nominally opposite extreme of negligible interactions is the limit of an infinitely high barrier . in that limit",
    ", the population imbalances in the first two pendula are of course self - trapped , but the local interaction can still be viewed as causing intra - well tunneling of atoms between the ground and excited modes .    from our semiclassical study",
    "we find that , in addition to the known bifurcation at the fixed point in the transition from the rabi to the josephson regime  @xcite , new fixed points emerge which stem from the competing effects of inter - well tunneling and intra - well inter - level ( local ) interactions .",
    "we find that the inclusion of additional modes leads to a shift in the tunneling frequencies .",
    "we also show that in the josephson regime the population of the ground modes can be used to control the tunneling dynamics of the excited ones .",

    "in the few - atom limit and for small interactions , the functions @xmath30 do not depart significantly from the non - interacting single - particle eigenstates of the individual wells .",
    "the spectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : two - level ] ) was thoroughly studied in this few - atom limit in refs .  .",
    "it was noted there that , once the interaction energies in a single well become larger than the difference between the ground and the first excited state , more than two levels need to be considered . while in this range the exact functional form of the eigenstates changes , the physics discussed below",

    "the fixed point associated with macroscopic tunneling for @xmath241 is shifted towards the less populated well and , since the time average of @xmath157 is no longer zero , the effect appears as self - trapping .",
    "this behavior can be magnified in the experimentally realizable case of @xmath242 , i.e. ,  when half of the atoms in one well are intentionally excited , while those in the other well are not . in general , by tuning the effective 1d scattering properties of the atoms and the initial populations of the atoms in an energy level , one can influence the dynamics of the atoms in the other energy level , even if on average no ( or only a few ) atoms are exchanged between the different energy modes .    finally , we would like to note that , in the region of @xmath185 to the right of point c in fig .

    "we have focused on regimes close to those found in the two - mode model .",
    "this means that we have assumed the level spacing to be greater than the energy ( @xmath4 ) which , stemming from the local interaction , characterizes both the intra - well inter - level coupling and the repulsive interaction between atoms in the ground and excited modes within the same well .",
    "we have found two main effects .",
    "the first one is that the semiclassical inclusion of the excited modes provides a simple model for the effect of dissipation on the collective dynamics of the ground modes .",
    "an interesting result is the slowing down of the low - lying oscillations in the presence of excited atoms .",
    "the second result is the discovery of a rich dynamics resulting from the manipulation of the population of the ground and excited modes .",
