    "in particular , we consider a simple @xmath5-hop decode - and - forward protocol , where , at hop @xmath6 , relay terminal @xmath7 hears and attempts to fully decode the data signal transmitted from terminal @xmath8 and forwards its re - encoded version over hop @xmath9 to terminal @xmath10 , as depicted in fig .

    "what remains is to use the per - hop reliability function and associated lower and upper bounds through error exponents and sphere packing exponents to develop a theoretical framework for the notion of a system - wide reliability concept that accounts for error events over all hops over the linear network . to this end",

    "@xcite in the networking literature .",
    "such a distributed approach involves the end - to - end propagation of a single parameter ; only requiring neighbor - to - neighbor message passing of the accumulated multi - hop link cost metric which is updated by each terminal with the addition of the cost of the last hop .",
