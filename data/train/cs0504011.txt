    "ensemble analysis on weight distributions of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes gives us insights on properties of an instance of the ensemble .",

    "the average coset weight distribution ( acwd ) of the gallager ensemble has been introduced by the author @xcite @xcite and the acwd formulas of the gallager ensemble has been derived .",
    "these papers show that the acwd of an ensemble indicates some detailed properties of a code ( e.g. , weight of coset leaders ) which is not available from an average weight distribution .",
    "structured ldpc codes are known to be a promising class of codes which attains excellent trade - offs between decoding complexity versus decoding performance .",
    "an instance of a structured ldpc code can be regarded as a regular or an irregular ldpc code with additional constraints on edge connections .",
    "this class of ldpc codes includes some well known codes such as repeat accumulate codes ( ra code ) @xcite , irregular repeat and accumulate codes ( ira code ) @xcite , and multi - edge type ldpc codes @xcite , etc ..    for design and analysis of structured ldpc codes , knowledge on the average weight distribution and the acwd is desirable .",

    "our main focus is on ensembles of combined matrices , which is called _ combined ensemble_. a party check matrix of a structured ldpc codes can be considered as a combined matrix . a combined ensemble is composed of a set of simpler ensembles such as a regular bipartite ensemble .",
