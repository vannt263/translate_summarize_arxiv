    "if a delaunay edge @xmath5 is @xmath9-stable then it remains in @xmath0 during any continuous motion of @xmath1 for which every angle @xmath44 , for @xmath45 , changes by at most @xmath46 .",

    "( this argument also covers the cases when a point @xmath51 crosses @xmath49 from side to side : since each point , on either side of @xmath49 , sees @xmath5 at an angle of @xmath52 , it follows that no point can cross @xmath5 itself  the angle has to increase from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",

    "what this analysis also implies is that if the true bound for kinetic changes in a delaunay triangulation is really close to cubic , then the overhelming majority of these changes involve edges which never become stable and just flicker in and out of the diagram by cocircularity with their two delaunay neighbors .    in sections [ sec : polygprop ] and [ sec : reduces ] we show that @xmath3 can be maintained by a kinetic data structure that uses only near - linear storage ( in the terminology of @xcite , it is _ compact _ ) , encounters only a nearly quadratic number of critical events ( it is _ efficient _ ) , and processes each event in polylogarithmic time ( it is _ responsive _ ) . for the second data structure , described in section [ sec : reduces ] , can be slightly modified to ensure that each point appears at any time in only polylogarithmically many places in the structure ( it then becomes _ local _ ) .",
    "the scheme described in section [ sec : polygprop ] is based on a useful and interesting  equivalence \" connection between the ( euclidean ) @xmath3 and a suitably defined  stable \" version of the delaunay triangulation of @xmath1 under the  polygonal \" norm whose unit ball @xmath30 is a regular @xmath12-gon , for @xmath13 .",

    "we call such a placement a _ corner contact _ at the appropriate point . note that a corner contact where some vertex @xmath148 of ( a copy @xmath144 of ) @xmath30 touches @xmath6 has the property that the center of @xmath144 lies on the fixed ray emanating from @xmath6 and parallel to the directed segment from @xmath148 to the center of @xmath30",
    ".    a useful property of bisectors and delaunay edges , in the special case where @xmath30 is a regular @xmath12-gon , which will be used in the next subsection , is that the breakpoints along a bisector @xmath149 alternate between corner contacts at @xmath6 and corner contacts at @xmath7 . indeed , assuming general position , each point @xmath150 determines a unique placement of @xmath30 where it touches @xmath6 at @xmath148 and also touches @xmath7 , as is easily checked .",
    "a symmetric property holds when we interchange @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "however , this distance for @xmath6 is the length of a full edge of @xmath152 , because the motion starts and ends with @xmath6 touching a vertex , and therefore the same holds for @xmath7 , which is impossible ( unless @xmath7 also starts and ends at a vertex , which contradicts our general position assumption ) .",
    "another well known property of @xmath30-bisectors and voronoi edges , for arbitrary convex polygons in general position with respect to @xmath1 , is that two bisectors @xmath154 , @xmath155 , can intersect at most once ( again , assuming general position ) , so every @xmath30-voronoi edge @xmath156 is connected .",

    ".    our algorithm will detect the possibility of such an event before the criticality occurs , when @xmath629 becomes @xmath9-short ( or even before this happens ) .",
    "it will then remove this edge from the stable subgraph , so the actual cocircularity will not be recorded . the new edge @xmath631",
    "will then be detected by the algorithm only when it becomes sufficiently long ( if this happens at all ) , and will then enter the stable delaunay graph .",
    "in short , critical cocircularities do not arise _ at all _ in our scheme .    as noted in the introduction ,",
    "a delaunay edge @xmath632 ( interior to the hull ) is just about to become @xmath9-short or @xmath9-long when the sum of the opposite angles in its two adjacent delaunay triangles is @xmath53 ( see figure [ fig : longdelaunay ] ) .",
    "this shows that changes in the stable delaunay graph occur when the `` cocircularity defect '' of a nearly cocircular quadruple ( i.e. , the difference between @xmath54 and the sum of opposite angles in the quadrilateral spanned by the quadruple ) is between @xmath9 and @xmath56 , where @xmath58 is the constant used in our definitions in section [ sec : viapolygonal ] or section [ sec : reduces ] .",
    "note that a degenerate case of cocircularity is a collinearity on the convex hull .",
    "such collinearities also do not show up in the stable delaunay graph . ; see , e.g. , @xcite . ]",
    "a hull collinearity between three nodes @xmath633 is detected before it happens , when ( or before ) the corresponding voronoi edge becomes @xmath9-short , in which case the angle @xmath634 , where @xmath58 is the middle point of the ( near-)collinearity becomes @xmath53 ( see figure [ collinearity ] ) .",
    "therefore a hull edge is removed from the @xmath3 if the delaunay triangle is almost collinear .",
    "the edge ( or any new edge about to replace it ) re - appears in the @xmath3 when its corresponding voronoi edge is long enough , as before .",
    "consider the voronoi cell @xmath23 of a point @xmath6 , and suppose that @xmath6 has only one @xmath9-long edge @xmath8 .",
    "since the angle at which @xmath6 sees @xmath8 is at most @xmath54 , the sum of the angles at which @xmath6 sees the other edges is at least @xmath54 , so @xmath23 has at least @xmath635 @xmath9-short edges .",
    "let @xmath636 denote the number of points @xmath6 with this property .",

    "[ fig : skeleton ] we sketch a straightforward proof of the fact that the edges of the @xmath10-skeleton are @xmath9-stable in @xmath21 , provided that @xmath648 .",
    "a similar argument shows that the stable delaunay graph contains the closest pair in @xmath649 as well as the crust of a set of points sampled sufficiently densely along a 1-dimensional curve ( see @xcite for the definition of crusts and their applications in surface reconstruction ) .",
    "we only sketch the argument for closest pairs : if @xmath179 is a closest pair then @xmath650 , and the two adjacent delaunay triangles @xmath651 are such that their angles of @xmath40 are at most @xmath652 each , so @xmath8 is @xmath653-long , ensuring that @xmath5 belongs to any stable subgraph for @xmath9 sufficiently small ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "we omit the proof for crusts , which is fairly straightforward .",
    "in contrast , stable delaunay graphs need not contain all the edges of several other important subgraphs of the delaunay triangulation , including the euclidean minimum spanning tree , the gabriel graph , the relative neighborhood graph , and the all - nearest - neighbors graph . an illustration for the relative neighborhood graph is given in figure [ norng1 ] . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the stable delaunay graph need not even be connected , as is illustrated in figure  [ norng2 ] .      as argued above , the delaunay edges that are missing in the stable subgraph correspond to nearly cocircular quadruples of points , or to nearly collinear triples of points near the boundary of the convex hull .",
    "arguably , these missing edges carry little information , because they may  flicker \" in and out of the delaunay triangulation even when the points move just slightly ( so that all angles determined by the triples of points change only slightly ) .",
    "nevertheless , in many applications it is desirable ( or essential ) to complete the stable subgraph into _ some _ triangulation , preferrably one that is also stable in the combinatorial sense  it undergoes only nearly quadratically many topological changes .    by the analysis in section [ sec : polygprop ]",
    "we can achieve part of this goal by maintaining the full delaunay triangulation @xmath59 under the polygonal norm induced by the regular @xmath12-gon @xmath654 .",
    "this diagram experiences only a nearly quadratic number of topological changes , is easy to maintain , and contains all the stable euclidean delaunay edges , for an appropriate choice of @xmath655 .",
    "moreover , the union of its triangles is simply connected  it has no holes .",
    "unfortunately , in general it is not a triangulation of the entire convex hull of @xmath1 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : almosttriangulation ] .    for the time being , we leave it as an open problem to come up with a simple and  stable \" scheme for filling the gaps between the triangles of @xmath59 and the edges of the convex hull",

    ", if we only want to maintain a triangulation of @xmath1 that experiences only a nearly quadratically many topological changes , then we can use the scheme in @xcite , or the earlier , somewhat more involved scheme in @xcite . however , if we want to keep the triangulation  as delaunay as possible \" , we should include in it the stable portion of @xmath0 , and then the efficient completion of it , as mentioned above , becomes an issue , not yet resolved .",
    "one way of interpreting the results of section 3 is that the stability of delaunay edges is preserved , in an appropriately defined sense , if we replace the euclidean norm by the polygonal norm induced by the regular @xmath12-gon @xmath654 ( for @xmath655 ) .",
    "that is , stable edges in one delaunay triangulation are also edges of the other triangulation , and are stable there too . here",

    "<S> we show that ( i ) @xmath3 always contains at least roughly one third of the delaunay edges at any fixed time ; ( ii ) it contains the @xmath10-skeleton of @xmath1 , for @xmath11 ; ( iii ) it is stable , in the sense that its edges survive for long periods of time , as long as the orientations of the segments connecting ( nearby ) points of @xmath1 do not change by much ; and ( iv ) stable delaunay edges remain stable ( with an appropriate redefinition of stability ) if we replace the euclidean norm by any sufficiently close norm .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if we approximate the euclidean norm by a polygonal norm ( with a regular @xmath12-gon as its unit ball , with @xmath13 ) , we can define and keep track of a euclidean @xmath3 by maintaining the full delaunay triangulation of @xmath1 under the polygonal norm ( which is trivial to do , and which is known to involve only a nearly quadratic number of discrete changes ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we describe two kinetic data structures for maintaining @xmath3 when the points of @xmath1 move along pseudo - algebraic trajectories of constant description complexity . </S>",
    "<S> the first uses the polygonal norm approximation noted above , and the second is slightly more involved , but significantly reduces the dependence of its performance on @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> both structures use @xmath14 storage and process @xmath15 events during the motion , each in @xmath16 time . </S>",
    "<S> ( here the @xmath17 notation hides multiplicative factors which are polynomial in @xmath18 and polylogarithmic in @xmath2 . ) </S>"
