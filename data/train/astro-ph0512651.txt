    "in 1998 , via the distance measurements of type ia supernovae , it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "the accelerating expansion of the present universe was reinforced recently by the updated supernova data @xcite and the wmap measurement @xcite of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "regarding the cosmic evolution , it is the common consensus that normal matter ( such as protons , neutrons , electrons , etc . )",
    "can only provide attractive gravity and therefore should always slow down the cosmic expansion , i.e. , @xmath0 thus , to explain this surprising , mysterious phenomenon of the accelerating expansion , many people rely on exotic energy sources , as generally called `` dark energy '' , which provide significant negative pressure and accordingly anti - gravity ( repulsive gravity ) .",
    "the above conclusion about the existence of the cosmic acceleration and the necessity of introducing dark energy is based on a simplified cosmological model , the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model , and indeed could be model - dependent . in the flrw model the universe is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic ( i.e.  the cosmological principle ) and accordingly the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric is invoked in the einstein equations that describe the evolution of the universe",
    ". meanwhile the energy - momentum tensor in the right - hand side of the einstein equations is regarded to truly reflect the real energy distribution ( averaged in space ) of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , so far there is no convincing proof validating this simplification .",
    "apparently , our universe at present is not homogeneous at small scales . the cosmological principle is roughly realized only at very large scales . to take advantage of the cosmological principle and invoke the rw metric",
    ", it is necessary to perform spatial averaging over large scales , along with which the form of the einstein equations in general should change because of the non - linearity of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "that is , ( i ) when invoking the rw metric and the real energy sources of our universe in the einstein equations for describing the cosmic evolution , the left - hand side ( the geometry part ) of the einstein equations should be modified , or , from another point of view , ( ii ) if one insists to use the einstein tensor corresponding to the rw metric in the left - hand side of the einstein equations ( or , equivalently , moving the above mentioned modification in the geometry part to the right - hand matter - energy part ) , there should appear new , effective energy sources coming from geometry ( which is certainly `` dark '' ) and consequently the energy - momentum tensor in the right - hand side does not truly correspond to the real energy distribution of our universe .",
    "thus , generally speaking , it is doubtful to employ the einstein equations to describe long - time , large - scale phenomena , such as the evolution of our universe , while the spatially averaged energy - momentum tensor and the spatially averaged metric tensor are used therein .",
    "( for more discussions about the validity and the problems of the flrw cosmology , see @xcite . )    instead of invoking exotic energy sources or unconfirmed physics , it is suggested @xcite that the cosmic acceleration might originate from the violation of the cosmological principle , homogeneity and isotropy , i.e. , the acceleration might be induced by the inhomogeneities of the universe .",
    "the possible change of the deceleration parameter in an inhomogeneous universe has been pointed out in refs . and .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the luminosity distance - redshift relation indicated by the supernova data can be reproduced in an inhomogeneous cosmological model without introducing dark energy @xcite .",
    "the current situation of our knowledge ( what we know and what we do not know well ) about observations , cosmic acceleration and inhomogeneities is as follows .     known  + @xmath1 _ based on the flrw cosmology , the current observational results indicate the existence of the cosmic acceleration . _",
    "( that is , by invoking the flrw cosmological model to interpret the observational data , one would conclude that the expansion of the universe is accelerating in the recent epoch . )     doubts  + ( 1 ) _ is the flrw cosmology a good approximation ? _ + ( 2 ) _ do the current observational results indicate the existence of cosmic acceleration for the real universe with complicated energy distribution ? _",

    "this issue will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ def ] . ) + ( 3 ) _ can the inhomogeneities of our universe explain the observational results ? _ + ( 4 ) _ can the inhomogeneities of our universe generate accelerating expansion ? _    these four doubts are far from being fully answered .",
    "this is due to the difficulties from the complexity of the real energy distribution and the non - linearity of the einstein equations .",
    "because of these difficulties , instead of dealing with the full einstein equations describing the real complicated universe , usually people employ the following two approaches to sketch the possible answers to the above doubts .",
    "\\(i ) _ taking perturbative approach with a simple background _ ( such as the homogeneous and isotropic rw background ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ invoking exact solutions of the einstein equations describing an inhomogeneous universe_.    in addition to these two approaches , there are also non - perturbative studies without invoking exact solutions , e.g. , see refs ..    via approach ( i ) with a homogenous and isotropic background , the positive answer to doubt ( 1 ) is supported in refs . and , and the negative answer to doubts ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) supported in refs",
    ".. nevertheless , the reliability of the perturbative approach in ( i ) is doubtful for investigating the late - time cosmic evolution , for which not only energy distribution , but also curvature , may not be described with perturbations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the arguments of refs . have been countered in refs .. the drawback of approach ( ii ) is that the exact solution invoked may be very different from the real situation of our universe . from some angle , instead of doubts ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , approach ( ii )",
    "is to answer a more general question :    @xmath1 _ can inhomogeneities explain observational results and generate accelerating expansion ?",
    "_    or , more precisely ,    ( 3@xmath2 ) _ does there exist a universe ( maybe very different from ours ) in which the inhomogeneities can explain the observational results ? _ + ( 4@xmath2 ) _ does there exist a universe in which the inhomogeneities can drive the expansion to accelerate ? _    via approach ( ii ) , for doubt ( 3@xmath2 ) it has been shown in refs . that the supernova data can be explained by invoking the lemaitre - tolman - bondi solution @xcite that describes a spherically symmetric ( but inhomogeneous ) dust fluid .    in the present work ,",
    "we take approach ( ii ) for investigating the general possibility of generating accelerating expansion via inhomogeneities , i.e.  doubt ( 4@xmath2 ) . against the common intuition in eq .",
    "( [ consensus ] ) we find examples of accelerating expansion in the case of a spherically symmetric dust fluid described by the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution , thereby giving support to the positive answer to doubt ( 4@xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition to our examples , kai et al .",
    "@xcite also found acceleration examples based on the ltb solution , where there exists singularity around the center of the spherically symmetric system during the accelerating epoch .",
    "in contrast , in our examples the system is smooth everywhere and no singularity is involved .",
    "( for more comparison , see sec .",
    "[ dom ] . )",
    "the possibility of the accelerating expansion in the ltb model was also pointed out by paranjape and singh in ref . ,",
    "in which numerical models exhibiting acceleration were constructed by an approximation where the contribution of 3-curvature dominates over the matter density .",
    "there also existed acceleration examples for a system consisting of two or more regions @xcite . in these acceleration examples , connecting the separate regions smoothly and the effect of the junction between these regions are the essential issues yet to be seriously explored .",
    "we particularly note that it needs much caution to connect two ( or more ) regions . in many cases",
    "the effect from the junction between separate regions is significant and should not be ignored . a similar doubt",
    "was also raised by paranjape and singh in ref .. as a demonstration of how things may go wrong when the connection or the junction is not appropriately taken care , in appendix [ app : nt_example ] we investigate in detail the acceleration examples studied by nambu and tanimoto in ref .",
    ", and show that actually there should be no acceleration in those cases when we properly connect the separate regions and seriously take the effect of the junction into account .",
    "the acceleration examples we find could be far away from the real situation of our universe .",
    "we are not proposing to employ these mathematical examples or the ltb solution to describe our universe .",
    "these acceleration examples , which provide positive answer to doubt ( 4@xmath2 ) , are to demonstrate how inhomogeneities can drive the expansion to accelerate , thereby showing how our intuition about the interplay of gravity and the cosmic evolution may go wrong [ i.e.  against the common intuition in eq .",
    "( [ consensus ] ) ] .",
    "accordingly , the effects of inhomogeneities on the evolution of the universe should be carefully restudied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ def ] , a tricky issue of the definition of acceleration is discussed and two definitions to be utilized for searching acceleration examples are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ ltb ] , the ltb solution is described . in sec .",
    "[ rad ] and sec .",
    "[ dom ] , we present the examples of the accelerating expansion corresponding to these two definitions of acceleration , respectively .",
    "a summary and discussions follow in sec .",
    "[ con ] .    throughout the present paper",
    "we will use the units where @xmath3 .",
    "we note that in this unit system there is still one unit unspecified , and , as a result , the value of one of the dimensionful quantities can be arbitrarily set .",
    "for example , in the acceleration examples we will present , the physical size of the spherical region under consideration can be any length long ( such as @xmath4fermi , @xmath4 cm , @xmath4pc , @xmath4mpc , hubble length @xmath5 , etc . ) .",
    "once the value of one of the dimensionful quantities ( which are independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) is settled , all the units for the dimensionful quantities studied in the present work are specified .",
    "in cosmology , expansion and acceleration of the universe are a subject associated with the evolution of the space ( in size ) , and should have nothing to do with the particle motion relative to the space . how to define the speed and the acceleration purely corresponding to the evolution of the space , meanwhile avoiding confusion and interference from the particle motion relative to the space ? this is a tricky issue for a real universe with complicated energy distribution @xcite .    to characterize the evolution status of the space ,",
    "usually one needs to invoke two quantities : a length ( distance ) quantity @xmath8 and a time quantity @xmath9 , with which @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where the over - dot denotes the time derivative ) present the speed and the acceleration of the expansion , respectively .",
    "the tricky issue mentioned above then corresponds to the problem of making the choice of these two quantities . with different choices one has different definitions",
    ". it will be puzzling if the description of the space evolution ( expansion and acceleration ) status is not universal but depends on the definition one invokes . if it is inevitable to make the choice which the description of the evolution status of the universe is based on and maybe sensitively depends on , what is the reasonable physical choice ?",
    "the very guiding principle for making the choice is that we are quantifying simply the evolution of the space and we need to make sure that the definition we invoke does not involve particle motion relative to the space nor something fake stemming from an inappropriate frame choice .    in this section",
    "we will introduce two definitions , as to be called `` _ _ line acceleration _ _ '' and `` _ _ domain acceleration _ _ '' , respectively involving two length quantities : ( i ) the distance between two points in space and ( ii ) the size of a domain in space . for these two kinds of lengths",
    "the above tricky issue relates to the choice of two points for the line acceleration and the choice of the domain ( i.e.  its boundary ) for the domain acceleration . with different choices ( corresponding to different definitions )",
    "one might obtain very different conclusions about the acceleration / deceleration status .    in general , with a certain choice of frame ( coordinate system ) ,",
    "the two spatial points and the boundary mentioned above can be fixed in the spatial coordinate space . with an improper choice of these two points and the boundary , or , equivalently , with an improper choice of frame ( in which the spatial coordinates of the two points and the boundary are fixed ) ,",
    "the change of the length quantity with time may be incapable of representing the true evolution of the space , which could be mixed up with the evolution of the frame .",
    "the contribution from the frame evolution to the acceleration of the chosen length will be called `` frame acceleration '' in the present paper .    to construct suitable definitions of acceleration for these two kinds of lengths ,",
    "for simplicity we consider a universe consisting of freely - moving particles ( i.e. , moving along geodesics ) , among which there is no interaction other than gravity . in this case , for the line acceleration a simple reasonable length quantity to choose is the distance between two ( freely - moving ) particles .",
    "in contrast , an apparently improper definition which could lead to fake frame acceleration is to invoke the distance between two points which move `` outward '' relative the particles in between , i.e. , accordingly , there are more and more particles between these two chosen spatial points .    as to the domain acceleration ,",
    "a reasonable choice is the size of a spatial domain in which the number of particles is constant in time .",
    "in contrast , an apparently improper definition which could lead to fake frame acceleration is to invoke a domain whose boundary moves outward relative the particles therein , i.e. , accordingly , there are more and more particles within this domain .    for implementing these two acceleration definitions ,",
    "meanwhile satisfying the above mentioned requirements for avoiding the confusion from particle motion and fake frame acceleration , it is particularly beneficial to use the synchronous gauge .",
    "note that in a dust universe the synchronous gauge can be chosen if and only if the vorticity vanishes . in the synchronous gauge",
    "the line element is as follows .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath9 is the cosmic time . in this gauge , the cosmic time @xmath9 is simple and universal to choose in defining acceleration .",
    "regarding the length quantity , in this gauge the above mentioned requirements are easy to meet because a point fixed in the spatial coordinate space is a geodesic .",
    "in particular , for a dust fluid with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 the distance between two fixed points and the size of a domain with its boundary fixed in this coordinate space are simple and direct choices satisfying the requirements . in the following",
    "we will focus on this simple case of a dust fluid described in the synchronous gauge , and introduce two definitions of acceleration involving these two length quantities respectively .",
    "regarding two points in space with the proper distance @xmath14 between them at time @xmath9 , it is reasonable to use @xmath15 and @xmath16 to characterize the expansion / collapse status and the acceleration / deceleration status of the space in between .",
    "the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter for the proper distance @xmath14 are defined in the usual way , as follows : @xmath17 the condition @xmath18 corresponds to the accelerating expansion of the proper distance between these two points in space , which is dubbed `` line acceleration '' in the present paper .",
    "we have found examples of the line acceleration in a dust universe , as to be shown in sec .",
    "[ rad ] .",
    "another definition of acceleration , as dubbed `` domain acceleration '' in the present paper , has been widely used in the literature @xcite .",

    ", @xmath23 one can define the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter of the domain in the usual way , as follows : @xmath24 the condition @xmath25 corresponds to the accelerating expansion of the domain ( in size ) , i.e. , domain acceleration .    as shown in @xcite , for an infinitesimal domain in a dust universe without vorticity",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath26 is always positive , i.e. , corresponding to local deceleration .",
    "nevertheless , the non - local deceleration / acceleration status of a domain with a nonzero finite volume ( in particular , the observational universe of the hubble size ) may be very different @xcite .",
    "so far there is no no - go theorem excluding the possibility of negative @xmath26 . on the contrary ,",
    "we have found examples of the domain acceleration in a dust universe , as to be shown in sec.[dom ] .",
    "we note that , in the special case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the rw metric with the scale factor @xmath27 , the expansion rates and the deceleration parameters defined above are the same as those in the standard cosmology : @xmath28    in the next section we will introduce the ltb solution , based on which we find examples of acceleration .",

    "since each region is decelerating one might expect that the domain acceleration in this case does not correspond to physically observable attributes ( e.g.  the luminosity distance - redshift relation ) of an accelerating flrw model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , on the contrary , it has been shown that for a system consisting of decelerating regions it is possible to fit the supernova data or to generate apparent acceleration @xcite .",
    "in addition , as already pointed out in introduction , it needs much caution to connect separate regions or to put them together .",
    "two particular important issues ( that may be closely related to each other ) are : + ( 1 ) there may be singularity in the junction between separate regions",
    ". + ( 2 ) the effect from the junction between separate regions may be significant and should be taken into account seriously .",
    "+ we have already had a lesson from the work by nambu and tanimoto in ref .",
    ", where they basically considered a system ( of spherical symmetry ) consisting of an inner and an outer decelerating flrw region and , as a result , they found and presented examples of the domain acceleration . in this system",
    "there is singularity in the junction between these two regions , and in their treatment the contribution from the junction is ignored .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section ( with details in appendix [ app : nt_example ] ) , it is inappropriate to ignore the junction .",
    "actually the junction makes significant contribution to the volume of the system , although it looks like a `` 2d '' surface in the coordinate space . after taking care of the singularity and taking into account the volume of the junction",
    ", we find that there exists no domain acceleration in the cases studied in ref ..",
    "another concern is about the definition of acceleration , as discussed in sec .",
    "the two definitions employed in the present paper  line acceleration and domain acceleration , on which our acceleration examples are based  follow the scenario proposed in sec.[def ] for a system of freely moving particles interacting with each other only through gravity . for the purpose of truly representing the space evolution status while avoiding the confusion from particle motion and fake frame acceleration , the length quantities invoked in this scenario to define acceleration are ( 1 ) the distance between two freely moving particles for the line acceleration and ( 2 ) the size of a spatial region with constant number of particles therein for the domain acceleration .",
    "regarding the frame / gauge choice , we have emphasized the advantage of the synchronous gauge in which the above requirements for the length involved in the acceleration definition can be easily met .",
    "in addition , in this gauge , there exists a universal cosmic time that is the proper time of comoving observers , and for a region with its boundary fixed in the coordinate space the volume expansion rate coincides with the expansion rate of the physical proper volume .",
    "the counter - intuitive acceleration examples we found raise two issues worthy of further investigations :    @xmath1 _ how to understand these counter - intuitive examples ? _",
    "+ @xmath1 _ can inhomogeneities explain `` cosmic acceleration '' ?",
    "_    regarding the first issue , the common intuition about eq.([consensus ] ) may actually stem from newtonian gravity that is a perturbed version of general relativity in the newtonian limit with the minkowski space - time as the background .",
    "accordingly , this intuition may be valid only for considering the particle motion relative to a background space - time in a perturbative framework , but may be invalid for considering the evolution of space - time that is described by general relativity . for further understanding the cosmic evolution and other topics involving the general - relativity effects as the dominant effects , it will be helpful if one can build the intuition about general relativity , i.e. , with which one can make a proper guess at the behavior of the space - time geometry for an arbitrarily given energy distribution .",
    "regarding the second issue , the most important is whether the inhomogeneities of our universe can explain the supernova data .",
    "if yes , the next step is to see , according to observational data , how the universe evolves , in particular , whether the cosmic acceleration exists or not , in this cosmological model taking the real inhomogeneities into account .",
    "so far the examples we found may be far away from the real situation of our universe . how to benefit from these mathematical examples in order to understand the present cosmic acceleration through the inhomogeneities of our universe is an important issue currently under our investigations .",
    "no matter whether the comic acceleration can eventually be explained simply by inhomogeneity , these examples have shown that inhomogeneity may affect the cosmic evolution in a manner far beyond the usual naive intuition about the interplay of gravity and the space - time geometry .",
    "thus , the effects of inhomogeneity on the cosmic evolution should be restudied carefully .",
    "these examples open a new perspective on the understanding of the evolution of our universe .",

    "[ fig : ntvton ] .",
    "this figure shows that the contribution to the total volume from the junction region remains significantly nonzero when @xmath82 becomes large .",

    "@xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 [ note that the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : junction volume lower bound ] ) is obtained by keeping only the singular part in the integrand . ]",
    "thus , even when the junction region goes to a `` 2d surface '' in the coordinate space , its volume remains significantly nonzero if the scale factor of the outer open under - density region ( @xmath145 ) is significantly larger than that of the inner closed over - density region ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , with the initial condition in eq.([eq : nt - initial condition ] ) we do have @xmath180 for @xmath156 .    note that by changing the initial condition for @xmath139 and @xmath141 [ instead of using that in eq .",

    "<S> it is the common consensus that the expansion of a universe always slows down if the gravity provided by the energy sources therein is attractive and accordingly one needs to invoke dark energy as a source of anti - gravity for understanding the cosmic acceleration . to examine this point </S>",
