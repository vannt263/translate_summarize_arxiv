    "the quantum vacuum amounts to a highly nontrivial state , characterized by the omnipresence of fluctuations of virtual particles . while the microscopic theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) does not provide for a direct ( tree - level ) interaction among photons , effective interactions of this kind are induced by quantum fluctuations of charged particles  in qed , electrons and positrons . specifically in strong electromagnetic fields",
    "quantum fluctuations give rise to effective , nonlinear interactions among photons and macroscopic electromagnetic fields @xcite ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most famous optical signatures of qed vacuum nonlinearity is vacuum birefringence @xcite experienced by probe photons traversing a strong field region , which is actively searched for in precision experiments using macroscopic magnetic fields @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent proposal .    at zero field ,",
    "the vacuum is characterized by translational invariance and the absence of any preferred direction .",
    "conversely , an external electromagnetic field generically introduces a preferred direction , and , in the presence of inhomogeneities , also breaks translational invariance for charged particles . via the charged particle - antiparticle fluctuations coupling to the external electromagnetic field , this preferred direction can also impact probe photon propagation .",
    "it can in particular affect the two probe photon polarization modes differently , and thereby effectively result in two different indices of refraction for these polarization modes .",
    "this can give rise to a birefringence phenomenon , manifesting itself in a tiny ellipticity picked up by an originally purely linearly polarized probe photon beam .",
    "as an ellipticity signal has a nonvanishing overlap with both linearly independent polarization modes spanning the transverse probe photon polarizations , vacuum birefringence alternatively manifests itself in signal photons scattered into an  originally empty  perpendicularly polarized mode .",
    "the number of perpendicularly polarized photons constitutes the most straightforward signature to be observed experimentally in a high - intensity laser experiment aiming at an experimental verification of vacuum birefringence put forward by @xcite , envisioning the combination of an optical high - intensity laser as pump and a linearly polarized x - ray pulse as probe ; cf . also @xcite . for proposals of vacuum birefringence experiments with dipole , synchrotron and gamma radiation , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other theoretical proposals aiming at the experimental study of optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity have focused on interference effects @xcite , photon - photon scattering in the form of laser - pulse collisions @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite , as well as photon merging @xcite and splitting @xcite .    in a recent feasibility study for detecting qed vacuum birefringence with x - ray free electron lasers ( fels ) and high - power optical lasers ,",
    "the probe photons are assumed to traverse the pump field on straight lines resembling their trajectories in vacuum at zero field @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity acquired by a probe photon counter - propagating the pump at a given impact parameter is then traced on such a straight - line trajectory . by construction",
    "this procedure only gives rise to signal photons emitted exactly in forward direction .",
    "the conclusion of this study was that the experimental verification of vacuum birefringence with state - of - the - art laser systems and polarimetry is possible , but  as the measurement is dominated by noise  requires a large number of laser shots to increase the statistics .",
    "however , another recent publication @xcite emphasized a way to overcome the noise domination , namely by exploiting the scattering of signal photons out of the cone of the incident probe beam . modelling the probe pulse as a non - divergent macroscopic electromagnetic field of finite transverse extent",
    ", the signal photons induced upon transversal of the pump laser field genuinely feature a finite divergence .",
    "assuming the probe in the interaction region to amount to the essentially divergence free segment of a gaussian beam around its focus , by an adequate choice of the beam parameters the divergence of the signal photons can be made substantially larger than the far - field divergence of the original probe beam . looking for signal photons scattered outside the divergence of the probe beam , the demands on the polarization purity are less stringent for detection under such angles due to the significantly lower background photon flux . in @xcite",
    "this scenario was studied under idealized conditions , assuming the beam axes of the pump and the probe to be perfectly aligned and the pulses to be exactly counter - propagating . while the pump was realistically modeled as a gaussian laser pulse in the paraxial approximation , the description of the probe was less elaborate and",
    "only its essential features were explicitly accounted for .",
    "more specifically , it was modeled as a plane wave with a longitudinal envelope implementing a finite pulse duration .",
    "its finite transverse extent was only indirectly accounted for , which limited the discussion to certain special cases , namely probe beams either significantly narrower or wider than the pump beam .",
    "here we go beyond these limitations and consider probe beams of finite width and generic elliptically shaped cross - sections . besides , we account for several additional parameters of experimental relevance , like a finite angle between the beams axes and finite impact parameters .",
    "these improvements facilitate unprecedented theoretical predictions of the experimental signals attainable in a dedicated discovery experiment of qed vacuum birefringence at a fel / high - intensity laser facility , like the upcoming helmholtz international beamline for extreme fields ( hibef ) @xcite at the european xfel @xcite at desy .",
