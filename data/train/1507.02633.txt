    "when a thin elastic rod is under compression on its two ends , it experiences an instability towards buckling as the compression exceeds a critical value ; this is the classical euler buckling problem  @xcite .",
    "this critical compression is determined by the competition between the compression and bending energy costs of the rod .",
    "the buckling instability plays an important role in many problems in fields ranging from physics to engineering and biology  @xcite .",
    "more recently , experimental studies on buckling phenomena at small length scales , such as the buckling of stiff or semiflexible polymers , nano - filaments , and nanotubes , have been enabled by advances in various technologies  @xcite .",
    "these studies may lead to novel devices that utilize transitions between multiple mechanical ground states . at these small scales , it is necessary to include effects of thermal fluctuations , which have been shown to lead to interesting phenomena near mechanical instabilities in various systems  @xcite .",
    "such thermal - fluctuation effects have been theoretically investigated , and phenomena such as corrections to the projected end - to - end length , shifts in the critical compression , and softening of the buckling transition have been discovered  @xcite .",
    "however , most of these theoretical studies on how fluctuations renormalize the buckling transition have focused on the case of inextensible polymers and have employed the worm - like chain model , which assumes that the polymer has a _ constant contour length_. this is an idealized limit where the rod can not be stretched / compressed . for real rods , although the resistance against stretching is much stronger than that against bending , it is worthwhile to discuss whether the extensibility of the rod changes what is known about buckling at finite temperature .    in this paper , we investigate finite - temperature buckling using a model elastic energy that allows for rod extensions . in this model ,",
    "the end - to - end distance is the control parameter ( fixed - strain ensemble ) , and the rod is allowed to have transverse fluctuations , which both stretch / compress and bend the rod . by integrating out higher - momentum modes which couple to the first fundamental mode through anharmonic terms , we calculate fluctuation corrections to the rigidity and analyze the buckling transition of the renormalized theory .",
    "we find that , in both two and three dimensions , thermal fluctuations shift the buckling transition to larger - magnitude values of compression .",
    "our monte carlo simulations verify the analytic phase diagram we obtain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagfull ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also analytically calculate the effective force of the rod , showing that , close to the buckling transition , thermal fluctuations are prominent and contribute an @xmath1 correction to the effective force .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in the presence of thermal fluctuations , the rod is never completely `` straight . ''",
    "the physical meaning of having a `` straight - buckled '' transition is that the mean - square transverse fluctuations of the rod ( e.g. , the mean - square transverse displacement of the midpoint of the rod ) change from zero in the straight phase to a nonzero value in the buckled phase . in other words , the elastic free energy minimum of the rod changes from the straight configuration to the buckled configurations .",

    "this is because it originates from quartic - order terms in the bending energy ( see eq .  ) where the spatial derivatives are on the legs that combine to form the loops in the feynman diagrams .",

    "thus , the landau free energy becomes @xmath237 since the first two terms are independent of @xmath65 , we can easily obtain an expression for the free energy , @xmath238 we now proceed to compute the latter two terms in this expression .",
