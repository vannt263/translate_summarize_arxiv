    "in this work we propose and explore two new ideas pertaining to the energy density functional ( edf ) methods .",
    "first , we suggest a necessity of shifting attention and focus of these methods from ground - state bulk properties ( e.g.  total nuclear masses ) to single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "properties , and to look for a spectroscopic - quality edfs that would correctly describe nuclear shell structure .",
    "proper positions of s.p .",
    "levels are instrumental for good description of deformation , pairing , particle - core coupling , and rotational effects , and many other phenomena .    on the one hand , careful adjustment of these positions were at the heart of tremendous success of phenomenological mean - field ( mf ) models , like those of nilsson , woods - saxon , or folded yukawa @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "similarly successful phenomenological description of nuclear masses , within the so - called microscopic - macroscopic method @xcite , relies on the liquid - drop mass surface , which is entirely decoupled from the s.p",
    ".  structure .    up two now ,",
    "methods based on using edfs , in any of its variants like local skyrme , non - local gogny , or relativistic - mean - field ( rmf ) @xcite approach , were mostly using adjustments to bulk nuclear properties . as a result",
    ", shell properties were described poorly .",
    "after so many years of investigations , a further increase in precision and predictability of all methods based on the edfs may require extensions beyond forms currently in use .",
    "before this can be fully achieved , we propose to first take care of the s.p.properties , and come back to precise adjustment of bulk properties once these extensions are implemented .",
    "second , we propose to look at the s.p .  properties of nuclei through the magnifying glass of odd - even mass differences . this idea has already been put forward in a seminal paper by rutz _",
    "@xcite , where calculations performed within the rmf approach were presented . in this paper",
    "we perform analogous analysis for the edfs based on the skyrme interactions .    on the one hand ,",
    "it was recognized long time ago , cf . ,",
    "e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , that the theoretical s.p .",
    "energies , defined as eigenvalues of the mf hamiltonian , can not be directly compared to experiment , because they are strongly renormalized by the particle - core coupling . on the other hand , procedures used to deduce the s.p .",
    "energies from experiment @xcite require various theoretical assumptions , by which these quantities cease to result from direct experimental observation . in the past , these theoretical and experimental caveats hampered the use of s.p .",
    "energies for proper adjustments of edfs .",
    "however , the odd - even mass differences carry very similar physical information to that given by s.p .",
    "energies , and have advantage of being clearly defined , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "indeed , experimental difference in mass between an odd nucleus and its lighter even - even neighbor , i.e. , the particle separation energy , is an easily available and unambiguous piece of data , which reflects the physical role of the s.p .",
    "energy , with all polarizations and couplings taken into account .",
    "similarly , differences of masses between the low - lying excited states in an odd system and lighter even - even neighbor may illustrate effective positions of higher s.p.states .",
    "physical connections between these mass differences and s.p.energies are closest in semi - magic nuclei , which will be studied in the present paper .    in theory ,",
    "the primary goal of the edf methods is to describe ground - state energies of fermion systems , i.e. , in nuclear - physics applications ",
    "masses of nuclei . for odd systems",
    ", the edf methods should give masses of ground states and of several low - lying excited states ; the latter being obtained by blocking specific s.p.orbitals .",
    "we stress here that in an odd system , separate self - consistent calculations have to be performed for each of the blocked states , so as to allow the system for exploring all possible polarizations exerted by the odd particle on the even - even core . again , this procedure is clearly defined and entirely within the scope and spirit of the edf method , which is supposed to provide exact energies of correlated states .",
    "note , that although one here calculates _",
    "total masses _ of odd and even systems , the comparison with experiment involves the _ differences of masses _ , for which many effects cancel out .",
    "therefore , one can confidently attribute calculated differences of masses to properties of effective s.p.energies , with all polarization effects taken into account , like in the experiment .",
    "again , in semi - magic nuclei such a connection is most reliable .    following the above line of reasoning , in the present paper we study experimental and theoretical aspects of the spin - orbit ( so ) splitting between the s.p",
    ".  states .",
    "in particular , we analyze the role of the so and tensor mfs in providing the correct values of the so splittings across the nuclear chart .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly recall basic theoretical building blocks related to the so and tensor terms of the edfs and interactions . in sect .  [ sec3 ] we discuss in details three major sources of the core polarization : the mass , shape , and spin polarizabilities . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we present a novel method that allows for a firm adjustment of the so and tensor coupling constants arguing that currently used functionals require major revisions concerning strengths of both these terms .",
    "the analysis is based on the @xmath4 so splittings in three key nuclei , including spin - saturated isoscalar @xmath1ca , spin - unsaturated isoscalar @xmath2ni , and spin - unsaturated isovector @xmath3ca systems , and is subsequently verified by systematic calculations of the so splittings in magic nuclei . in sect .",
    "[ sec5 ] we discuss an impact of these changes on binding energies in magic nuclei .",
    "conclusions of the paper are presented in sect .",
    "we begin by recalling the form of the edf , which will be used in the present study . in the notation defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and extensions ) , the edf reads @xmath5 where the local energy density @xmath6 is a sum of the kinetic energy , and of the potential - energy isoscalar ( @xmath7 ) and isovector ( @xmath8 ) terms , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 for the time - even , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and time - odd , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , local densities we follow the convention introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein .",
    "in particular , the so density @xmath19 is the vector part of the spin - current tensor density @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 with @xmath22    in the context of the present study , the time - even tensor and so parts of the edf , @xmath23 are of particular interest .    in the spherical - symmetry limit , the scalar @xmath24 and symmetric - tensor @xmath25 parts of the spin - current tensor vanish , and thus @xmath26 where the so density has only the radial component , @xmath27 .",
    "variation of the tensor and so parts of the edf over the radial so densities @xmath28 gives the spherical isoscalar ( @xmath7 ) and isovector ( @xmath8 ) so mfs , @xmath29 which can be easily translated into the neutron ( @xmath30 ) and proton ( @xmath31 ) so mfs , @xmath32 although below we perform calculations without assuming spherical and time - reversal symmetries , here we do not repeat general expressions for the so mean - fields , which can be found in refs .",
    "we also note that , in principle , in this general case , one could use different coupling constant multiplying each of the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ spin - current2 ] ) . in the present exploratory study",
    ", we do not implement this possible extension of the edf , and we use unique tensor coupling constants @xmath33 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ hte ] ) .",
    "identical potential - energy terms of the edf , eqs .",
    "( [ hte ] ) and ( [ hto ] ) , are obtained by averaging the skyrme effective interaction within the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approximation @xcite . by this procedure ,",
    "the edf coupling constants @xmath34 can be expressed through the skyrme - force parameters , and one can use parameterizations existing in the literature .",
    "it is clear that one can study tensor and so effects entirely within the edf formalism , i.e. , by considering the corresponding tensor and so parts of the edf , eqs .",
    "( [ htta ] ) and ( [ httb ] ) , and coupling constants @xmath33 and @xmath35 , respectively",
    ". however , in order to link this approach to those based on the skyrme interactions , we recall here expressions based on averaging the zero - range tensor and so forces @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent analyses .",
    "namely , in the spherical - symmetry limit , one has @xmath36 , \\ ] ] @xmath37,\\ ] ] where in eq .",
    "( [ h_so ] ) two different coupling constants , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , were introduced following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the corresponding so mfs read @xmath40 [ note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the factor of @xmath41 was missing at the @xmath38 term of eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] . by comparing eqs .  ( [ sotnp ] ) and ( [ so ] ) , one obtains the following relations between the coupling constants : @xmath42 for further discussion of the skyrme forces and their relation to tensor components we refer the reader to an extensive and complete recent discussion presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this exploratory work ,",
    "we base our considerations on the edf method and deliberately break the connection between the functional ( [ hte ] ) , and the skyrme central , tensor , and so forces .",
    "nevertheless , in the time - even sector , our starting point is the conventional skyrme - force - inspired functional with coupling constants fixed at the values characteristic for either skp  @xcite , sly4  @xcite , or sko  @xcite skyrme parameterizations .",
    "however , poorly known coupling constants in the time - odd sector ( those which are not related to the time - even ones through the local - gauge invariance @xcite ) are fixed independently of their skyrme - force values .",
    "for this purpose , the spin coupling constants @xmath43 are readjusted to reproduce empirical values of the landau parameters , according to the prescription given in refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath44 are set equal to zero .",
    "these variants of the standard functionals are below denoted by skp@xmath45 , sly4@xmath45 , and sko@xmath45 .",
    "strictly pragmatic reasons , like technical complexity and lack of firm experimental benchmarks , made the majority of older skyrme parameterizations simply disregard the tensor terms , by setting @xmath46 .",
    "recent experimental discoveries of new magic shell - openings in neutron - reach light nuclei , e.g. , around @xmath47 @xcite , and their subsequent interpretation in terms of tensor interaction within the shell - model  @xcite , caused a revival of interest in tensor terms within the mf approach @xcite , which is naturally tailored to study s.p .  levels . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tensor terms mark clear and unique fingerprints in isotonic and isotopic evolution of s.p .",
    "levels and , in particular , in the so splittings .    in this paper ,",
    "we perform systematic study of the so splittings .",
    "the goal is to resolve contributions to the so mf ( [ sot ] ) due to the tensor and so parts of the edf , and to readjust the corresponding coupling constants @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is shown that this goal can be essentially achieved by studying the @xmath48 so splittings in three key nuclei : @xmath1ca , @xmath3ca , and @xmath2ni .",
    "before we present in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] details of the fitting procedure and values of the obtained coupling constants , first we discuss effects of the core polarization and its influence on the calculated and so splittings .",
    "in spite of the fact that the s.p .  levels belong to basic building blocks of the mf methods , there is still a vivid debate concerning their physical reality . the question",
    "whether they constitute only a set of auxiliary quantities , or represent real physical entities that can be inferred from experimental data , was never of any concern for methods based on phenomenological one - body potentials .",
    "indeed , these potentials were bluntly fitted directly to reproduce the s.p .",
    "levels deduced , in one way or another , from empirical information around doubly - magic nuclei , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in turn",
    ", these potentials also appear to properly ( satisfactorily ) reproduce the one - quasiparticle band - heads in open - shell nuclei , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this success seems to legitimate the physical reliability of the theoretical s.p .",
    "levels within the microscopic - macroscopic approaches .",
    "the debate concerns mostly the self - consistent mf approaches based on the edf methods or two - body effective interactions .",
    "the arguments typically brought forward in this context underline the fact that the self - consistent mfs are most often tailored to reproduce bulk nuclear properties like masses , densities , radii , and certain properties of nuclear matter .",
    "consequently , the underlying interactions are non - local with effective masses @xmath49  @xcite , what in turn artificially lowers the density of s.p .  levels around the fermi energy .",
    "it was pointed out by several authors  @xcite that restitution of physical density of the s.p .",
    "levels around the fermi energy can be achieved only after inclusion of particle - vibration coupling , i.e. , by going beyond mf .",
    "within the effective theories , however , these arguments do not seem to be fully convincing .",
    "first of all , an effective theory with properly chosen data set used to fit its parameters should automatically _ select _ physical value of the effective mass and readjust other parameters ( coupling constants ) to this value .",
    "examples of such _ implicit _ scaling are well known for the shf theory including : ( _ i _ ) explicit effective mass scaling of the coupling constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 through the fit to the spectroscopic landau parameters  @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) direct dependence of the isovector coupling constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the isoscalar effective mass through the fit to the ( observable ) symmetry energy strength  @xcite ; ( _ iii _ ) numerical indications for the @xmath54 scaling of the so interaction inferred from the @xmath55-@xmath56 splittings in @xmath57 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the differences between various parameterizations of the skyrme - force ( or functional ) parameters rather clearly suggest that such an _ implicit _ @xmath54 dependence of functional coupling constants is a fact , which is , however , neither well recognized nor understood so far .",
    "secondly , the use of effective interaction with parameters fitted at the mf level is not well justified in beyond - mf approximation .",
    "rather unavoidable double counting results in such a case , and quantitative estimates of level shifts resulting from such calculations need not be very reliable .",
    "it is , therefore , quite difficult to accept the viewpoint that unsatisfactory spectroscopic properties of , in particular , modern skyrme forces can be cured solely by going beyond mf . on the contrary , the magnitude of discrepancies between the shf and experimental s.p",
    ".  levels ( see below ) rather clearly suggest that : ( _ i _ ) the data sets used to fit the force ( or functional ) parameters are incomplete and ( _ ii _ ) the interaction / functional should be extended .",
    "this is exactly the task undertaken in the present exploratory work .",
    "we extend the conventional edfs based on skyrme interactions by including tensor terms , and fit the corresponding coupling constants to the so splittings rather than to masses .",
    "the preliminary goal is to improve spectroscope properties of functionals , even at the expense of the quality in reproducing the binding energies .",
    "empirical energy of a given s.p .",
    "neutron orbital can be deduced from the difference between the ground - state energy of the doubly - magic core with @xmath58 neutrons , @xmath59 , and energies , @xmath60 or @xmath61 , of its odd neighboring isotopes having a single - particle ( p ) or single - hole ( h ) occupying that orbital , i.e. , @xmath62 see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and referenced cited therein .",
    "note that the total energies above are negative numbers and _ decrease _ with increasing numbers of particles , @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , we can define a measure of the neutron shell gap as the difference between the lowest single - particle and highest single - hole energy , @xmath64 single - particle energies of proton orbitals and proton shell gaps are defined in an analogous way .",
    "consistently with the empirical definitions , in the present paper , the same procedure is used on the theoretical level @xcite .",
    "it means that we determine the total energies of doubly - magic cores and their odd neighbors by using the edf method , and then we calculate the s.p.energies as the corresponding differences ( [ eq307a ] ) or ( [ eq307b ] ) . in this way , we avoid all the ambiguities related to questions of what the s.p .",
    "energies really are and how they can be extracted from data .",
    "our methodology simply amounts to a specific way of comparing measured and calculated masses of nuclei .",
    "in odd nuclei , one has to ensure that particular s.p .",
    "orbitals are occupied by odd particles , but still the calculated total energies correspond to masses of their ground and low - lying excited states . since here",
    "we consider only doubly - magic nuclei and their odd neighbors , the pairing correlations are neglected .    in our calculations ,",
    "both time - even and time - odd polarizations exerted by an odd particle / hole on the doubly - magic core are evaluated self - consistently . in order to discuss these polarizations ,",
    "let us recall that the extreme s.p .",
    "model , in which ground - state energies are sums of fixed s.p .",
    "energies of occupied orbitals , is the model with no polarization of any kind included . in this model ,",
    "the differences of ground - state energies , eqs .",
    "( [ eq307a ] ) and ( [ eq307b ] ) , are , of course , exactly equal to the model s.p.energies . having this background model in mind",
    ", we can distinguish three kinds of polarization effects :      this effect can be understood as the self - consistent rearrangement of all nucleons , which is induced by an added or subtracted odd particle , while the shape is constrained to the spherical point and the time - odd mean fields are neglected .",
    "one has to keep in mind , that none of the s.p .",
    "orbitals of a spherical multiplet is spherically symmetric , and therefore , when a particle in such a state is added to a closed core , the resulting state of an odd nucleus can not be spherically symmetric , and thus can not be self - consistent .",
    "a self - consistent solution can only be realized within the so - called filling approximation , whereupon one assumes the occupation probabilities of all orbitals belonging to the spherical multiplet of angular momentum @xmath65 and degeneracy @xmath66 , to be equal to @xmath67 .",
    "the mass polarization effect is exactly zero when evaluated within the first - order approximation . indeed , as expressed by the koopmans theorem @xcite , the linear term in variation of the total energy with respect to adding or subtracting a particle is exactly equal to the bare single - particle energy of the core .",
    "however , the obtained results do not agree with koopmans theorem .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ t0 ] , where we compare bare and polarized s.p .",
    "energies of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbitals in @xmath1ca .",
    "one can see that for both orbitals there is a quite large and positive mass polarization effect .",
    "the reason for this disagreement lies in the fact that , because of the center - of - mass correction , the standard edf calculations are not really variational with respect to adding or subtracting a particle .",
    "indeed , in these calculations , the total energy of an @xmath70-particle system is corrected by the center - of - mass correction @xcite , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average kinetic energy of the system .",
    "the factor of @xmath73 is not varied when constructing the standard mean - field hamiltonian , and therefore , the koopmans theorem is violated .",
    "had this variation been included , it would have shifted the mean - field potential and thus all bare s.p .",
    "energies in given nucleus by a constant , @xmath74 in @xmath1ca , this shift equals to 0.40mev and almost exactly corresponds to the entire mass polarization effect shown in fig .",
    "the remaining mass polarization effect can be attributed to higher - order polarization effects ( beyond linear ) and to the non - selfconsistency of the filling approximation .",
    "a few remarks about the shift in eq .",
    "( [ eq711 ] ) are here in order .",
    "first , the effect is independent on whether the two - body or one - body center - of - mass correction @xcite is used , and on whether this is done before or after variation .",
    "only the detailed value of the shift may depend on a particular implementation of the center - of - mass correction .",
    "second , the shift induces an awkward result of the mean - field potential going asymptotically to a positive constant and not to zero .",
    "although this may seem to be a trivial artifact , which does not influence the s.p .",
    "wave functions and observables , it shows that the standard center - of - mass correction should be regarded as an ill - defined theoretical construct .",
    "this fact shows up as an acute problem in fission calculations @xcite .",
    "third , whenever the bare s.p .",
    "energies are compared to empirical data , this shift must by taken into account . alternatively ,",
    "as advocated in the present study , one should compare directly the calculated and measured mass differences .",
    "finally , one should note that the shift is irrelevant when differences of the s.p .",
    "energies are considered , such as the so splittings discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "particle and the @xmath75 hole in @xmath1ca .",
    "the polarized s.p .",
    "levels were deduced from binding energies in one particle / hole nuclei according to the formulas  ( [ eq307a ] ) and ( [ eq307b ] ) .",
    "note that attractive ( repulsive ) polarization corrections to the binding energies shift the particle state down ( up ) and the hole state up ( down ) , respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]      this effect is well known both in the mf and particle - vibration - coupling approaches . within a deformed mf theory ( with the time - odd mean fields neglected ) , it corresponds to a simple fact that the s.p .",
    "energies ( eigen - energies in a deformed potential ) depend on the deformation in specific way , which is visualized by the standard nilsson diagram @xcite . indeed , in an axially deformed potential , a spherical multiplet of angular momentum @xmath65 splits into @xmath76 orbitals according to moduli of the angular - momentum projections @xmath77 . unless @xmath78 , for prolate and oblate deformations , orbitals with @xmath79 decrease and increase in energy , respectively , while those with maximum @xmath80 behave in an opposite way .",
    "therefore , both for prolate and oblate deformations , and for @xmath81 , the lowest orbitals have the energies that are lower than those at the spherical point .",
    "hence , a @xmath81 particle added to a doubly - magic core always polarizes the core in such a way that the total energy decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of a @xmath82 orbital does not depend on deformation ( in the first order ) , and thus such an orbital does not exert any shape polarization ( in this order ) .",
    "exactly the same result is obtained in a particle - vibration - coupling model , in which a @xmath81 particle can be coupled with either 0@xmath83 or 2@xmath83 state of the core , @xmath84_j$ ] or @xmath85_j$ ] , and the repulsion of these two configurations decreases the energy of the ground state with respect to the unperturbed spherical configuration @xmath84_j$ ] .",
    "as before , for @xmath78 , the configuration @xmath85_j$ ] does not exist , and the ground state is not lowered .",
    "the above reasoning can be repeated for hole states , with the result that the @xmath81 holes added to the doubly - magic core always polarize the core in such a way that the total energy also decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the shape polarization effect decreases the s.p .",
    "energies of particle states ( [ eq307a ] ) and increases those of hole states ( [ eq307b ] ) , and thus _ decreases _ the shell gap ( [ eq308 ] ) .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ t0 ] .      when an odd particle or hole is added to the core , and the time - odd fields",
    "are taken into account , it exerts polarization effects both in the time - even ( mass and shape ) and time - odd ( spin ) channels .",
    "it means that a non - zero average spin value of the odd particle induces a time - odd component of the mean field , which influences average spin values of all particles , leading to a self - consistent amplification of the spin polarization .",
    "it should be noted at this point that the spin polarization effect dramatically depends on the assumed symmetries and choices made for the occupied orbital , see discussion in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , without the time - odd fields , in order to occupy the odd particle or hole",
    ", one can use any linear combination of states forming the kramers - degenerate pair .",
    "the total energy is independent of this choice , because the time - even density matrix does not depend on it .",
    "this allows for making specific additional assumptions about the conserved symmetries , e.g. , in the standard case , one assumes that the odd state is an eigenstate of the signature ( or simplex ) symmetry with respect to the axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis",
    ". however , in order to fully allow for the spin polarization effects through time - odd fields , one has to release all such restrictive symmetries and allow for alignment of the spin of the particle along the symmetry axis .",
    "this requires calculations with broken signature symmetry and only the parity symmetry being conserved .",
    "therefore , calculations of this kind are more difficult than those performed within the standard cranking model .",

    "note , that the procedure leads to essentially identical so interaction strengths @xmath86 for all three forces irrespective of their intrinsic differences , for example in effective masses .",
    "the tensor coupling constants in both the skp and the sly4 functionals are also very similar . in the sko case , one observes rather clear enhancement in the isovector tensor coupling constant which becomes more negative to , most likely , counterbalance the non - standard positive strength in the isovector so channel .",
    "the functionals were modified using only three specific pieces of data on the neutron @xmath87 so splittings . in order to verify the reliability of the modifications ,",

    "in all these figures , estimates taken from ref .",
    "@xcite are used as reference empirical data .",
    "this global set of the results can be summarized as follows :    * the @xmath88 , @xmath89 , so splittings are slightly better reproduced with original rather than modified functionals . * the @xmath90 so splittings ( @xmath91o , @xmath92ca ) are rather poorly reproduced by both the original and modified functionals .",
    "these splitting are also subject to relatively big empirical uncertainties as shown in table  [ sodata ] and , therefore , need not be very conclusive .",
    "in particular , the @xmath90 so splittings in @xmath58=@xmath93 @xmath91o and @xmath1ca nuclei deduced from ref .",
    "@xcite and depicted in the figures show surprisingly large isospin dependence . *",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 splittings are quite well reproduced by both the original and modified functionals with slight preference for the modified functional , in particular for the sly4 interaction . *",

    "* magic gaps are also better ( although not fully satisfactorily ) reproduced by the modified functionals .    without any doubt",

    "it should be stressed that the improvements were reached using only three additional data points without any further optimization .",
    "the tensor coupling constants deduced in this work and collected in table  [ fity ] should be therefore considered as reference values . indeed ,",
    "direct calculations show that variations in @xmath97 within @xmath9810% affect the calculated so splittings only very weakly .",
