    "consensus problems have been recognized as important in distribution coordination of dynamic agent systems , which is widely applied in distributed computing @xcite , management science @xcite , flocking / swarming theory @xcite , distributed control @xcite , and sensor networks @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "the multi - agent systems need to agree on a common value for a certain quantity of interest that depends on the states of the interests of all agents or is a preassigned value .",
    "the interaction rule for each agent specifying the information communication between itself and its neighborhood is called the _ consensus protocol / algorithm_. a related concept of consensus , namely _ synchronization _ , is considered as `` coherence of different processes '' , and is a widely existing phenomenon in physics and biology .",
    "synchronization of interacting systems has been one of the focal points in many research and application fields @xcite . for more details on consensus and the relation between consensus and synchronization ,",
    "the reader is referred to the survey paper @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a basic idea to solve the consensus problem is updating the current state of each agent by averaging the previous states of its neighborhood and its own .",
    "the question then is whether or under which circumstances the multi - agent system can reach consensus by the proposed algorithm . in the past decade ,",
    "the stability analysis of consensus algorithms has attracted much attention in control theory and mathematics @xcite .",
    "the core purpose of stability analysis is not only to obtain the algebraic conditions for consensus , but also to get the consensus properties of the topology of the network .",
    "the basic discrete - time consensus algorithm can be formulated as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the state variable of the agent @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the discrete - time , @xmath4 denotes the neighborhood of the agent @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is the coupling strength .",
    "define @xmath6_{i , j=1}^{m}$ ] as the laplacian of the graph of the network in the manner that @xmath7 if @xmath8 and a link from @xmath9 to @xmath2 exists , @xmath10 if that @xmath8 and no link from @xmath9 to @xmath2 exists , and @xmath11 .",
    "with @xmath12 , ( [ form1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14^{\\top}$ ] .",
    "if the diagonal elements in @xmath15 are nonnegative , i.e. , @xmath16 , then @xmath15 is a stochastic matrix .",
    "( [ form2 ] ) is a general model of the synchronous consensus algorithm on a network with fixed topology .",
    "the network can be a directed graph , for example , the leader - follower structure @xcite , and may have weights .    in many real - world applications ,",
    "the connection structure may change in time , for instance when the agents are moving in physical space .",
    "one must then consider time - varying topologies under link failure or creation .",
    "the asynchronous consensus algorithm also indicates that the updating rule varies in time @xcite .",
    "thus , the consensus algorithm becomes @xmath17 where the time - varying coupling matrix @xmath18 expresses to the time - varying topology .",
    "we associate @xmath18 with a directed graph at time @xmath3 ( see sec .",
    "2 ) , in which @xmath19 implies that there is a link from @xmath9 to @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , which may be a _ self - link _ if @xmath20 . note that the self links in @xmath15 arise from the presence of the @xmath21 on the right hand side of ( [ form1 ] ) ; they do not necessarily mean that the physical network of multi - agents have self - loops .    furthermore , delays occur inevitably due to limited information transmission speed .",
    "the consensus algorithm with transmission delays can be described as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , denotes the time - dependent delay from vertex @xmath9 to @xmath2 . a link from @xmath9 to @xmath2",
    "is called _ instantaneous _",
    "if @xmath25 @xmath26 , and _ delayed _ otherwise .    in this paper , we study a general consensus problem in networks with time - varying topologies and time delays described by @xmath27 as well as the more general form @xmath28 note that ( [ multi_delay1 ] ) can be put into the form ( [ delayed ] ) by partitioning the inter - links according to delays , where @xmath29 is the maximum delay .",
    "however , ( [ delayed ] ) is more general , as it in principle allows for multiple links with different delays between the same pair of vertices . in particular",
    ", there may exist both instantaneous and delayed self - links , which may naturally arise in a model like ( [ form1 ] ) where the term @xmath21 appears both by itself as well as under the summation sign . in reference to ( [ delayed ] ) ,",
    "we talk about _ self - link(s ) _ when @xmath30 , which may be _ instantaneous _ or _ delayed _ depending on whether @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively . in equations ( [ multi_delay1])([delayed ] ) , @xmath33 denotes a stochastic process , @xmath34_{i , j=1}^{n}=[\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau_m}g_{ij}^{\\tau}(\\sigma^t)]_{i , j=1}^{n}$ ] is a stochastic matrix , @xmath35 is the stochastically - varying transmission delay from agent @xmath9 to agent @xmath2 .",
    "this model can describe , for instance , communications between randomly moving agents , where the current locations of the agents , and hence the links between them , are regarded as stochastic .",
    "furthermore , the delays are also stochastic since they arise due to the distances between agents . in this paper",
    ", @xmath36 is assumed to be an adapted stochastic process .",
    "( _ adapted process _ ) let @xmath37 be a stochastic process defined on the basic probability space @xmath38 , with the state space @xmath39 , the @xmath40-algebra @xmath41 , and the probability @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a filtration , i.e. , a sequence of nondecreasing sub-@xmath40-algebras of @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is measurable with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "@xmath46 , then the sequence @xmath47 is called an adapted process .    via a standard transformation",

    "then @xmath57 is a filtration .",
    "thus , it is clear that the notion of an adapted process is rather general , and it contains i.i.d .",
    "processes , markov chains , and so on , as special cases",
    ".    * related work .",
    "* many recent papers address the stability analysis of consensus in networks of multi - agents .",
    "however , the model ( [ multi_delay1 ] ) with delays we have proposed above is more general than the existing models in the literature .",
    "we first mention some papers where models of the form ( [ form3 ] ) are treated .",
    "a result from @xcite shows that ( [ form3 ] ) can reach consensus uniformly if and only if there exists @xmath58 such that the union graph across any @xmath59-length time period has a spanning tree . ref .",
    "@xcite derived a similar condition for reaching a consensus via an equivalent concept : _ strongly rooted _ graph .",
    "our previous papers @xcite studied synchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems of networks with time - varying topologies by a similar method .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that under the assumption that self - links always exist and are instantaneous ( i.e.  without delays ) , the condition presented in ref .",
    "@xcite also guarantees consensus with arbitrary bounded multiple delays .",
    "however , this criterion may not work when the time - varying topology involves randomness , because for any @xmath58 , it might occur with positive probability that the union graph across some @xmath59-length time period does not have a spanning tree for any @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite studied the consensus in networks under the circumstance that the processes @xmath60 are independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) and @xcite also investigated the stability of consensus of multi - agent systems with markovian switching topology with finite states . in these papers ,",
    "consensus is considered in the almost sure sense .",
    "@xcite studied a particular situation with packet drop communication .",
    "the most related literature to the current paper is @xcite , where a general stochastic process , an adapted process , was introduced to model the switching topology , which generalized the existing works including i.i.d . and",
    "markovian jumping topologies as special cases .",
    "the authors proved that , if the @xmath61-graph ( see its definition in sec .  2.2 ) corresponding to the conditional expectation of the coupling matrix sum across a finite time interval has a spanning tree almost surely , then the system reaches consensus .",
    "however , none of those works considered the stochastic delays but rather assumed that self - links always exist .",
    "there are also many papers concerned with the continuous - time consensus algorithm on networks of agents with time - varying topologies or delays .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a framework and ref .",
    "@xcite for a survey , as well as refs .",
    "@xcite , among others . also , there are papers concerned with nonlinear coupling functions @xcite and general coordination @xcite .",
    "* statement of contributions .",
    "* in the following sections , we study the stability of the consensus of the delayed system ( [ multi_delay1 ] ) , where @xmath33 is an adapted process .",
    "first , we consider the case that each agent contains an instantaneous self - link . in this case , we show that the same conditions enabling the consensus of algorithms without transmission delays , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , can also guarantee consensus for the case of arbitrary bounded delays .",
    "second , in case that delays also occur at the self - links ( for example , when it costs time for each agent to process its own information ) , and only certain delay patterns can occur , we show that the algorithm does not necessarily reach consensus but may synchronize to a periodic trajectory instead .",
    "as we show , the period of the synchronized state depends on the possible delay patterns .",
    "finally , we briefly study the situation without self - links , and present consensus conditions based on the graph topology and the product of coupling matrices .",
    "the basic tools we use are theorems about product of stochastic matrices and the results from probability theory . ref .",
    "@xcite has proved a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of infinite stochastic matrix products , which involves the concept of scramblingness .",
    "@xcite provided a means to get scrambling matrices ( defined in sec .",
    "2.2 ) from products of finite stochastic indecomposable aperiodic ( sia ) matrices and ref .",
    "@xcite showed that an sia matrix can be guaranteed if the corresponding graph has a spanning tree and one of the roots has a self - link .",
    "the borel - cantelli lemma @xcite indicates that if the conditional probability of the occurrence of sia matrices in a product of stochastic matrices is always positive , then it occurs infinitely often .",
    "these previous results give a bridge connecting the properties of stochastic matrices , graph topologies , and probability theory which we will call upon in the present paper .",

    "similarly to the the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] , the main condition of theorem [ thm3 ] and items ( ii ) and ( iii ) in lemma [ lem_syn_m2 ] imply that there exist @xmath441 and @xmath179 such that the subgraph @xmath442 is strongly connected , consequently having a spanning tree , and each vertex in @xmath443 is one of the roots in @xmath442 and has a self - link almost surely for all @xmath429 .",
