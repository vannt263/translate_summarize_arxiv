    "the @xmath0- or @xmath168-cocycles ( or @xmath168- or @xmath49-cocycles ) are used to define a quandle cocycle invariant of an oriented classical - link ( or an oriented surface - link ) .",

    "note that it is easy to construct a pair of trivial virtual - knot diagrams which need at least one vri - move between them , since the parity of the number of virtual - crossings is unchanged under the generalized reidemeister moves except for the vri - move . if we find such a pair of trivial virtual - knot diagrams for the other generalized reidemeister moves , we might be able to answer the next conjecture :    for any virtual - knot @xmath172 , there exist two diagrams @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath172 such that any sequence of generalized reidemeister moves between @xmath1 and @xmath2 must contain all of the generalized reidemeister moves .",
