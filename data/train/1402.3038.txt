    "the proton and neutron density distributions are some of the most fundamental properties of nuclei .",
    "charge radii of nuclei can be derived from charge density distributions which can be determined to a high accuracy ( often with the accuracy in charge radii better than 1% or better for many nuclei ) by experiments using electromagnetic probes , for example , electron scattering experiments  @xcite . the empirical information of proton radii is then obtained from these charge radii .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of neutron distributions , which have been studied mainly by hadron - nucleus scattering , is limited because the descriptions of strong interactions in nuclei are highly model dependent  @xcite .",
    "reliable neutron distributions will improve our understanding of the nucleus and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "nuclei with neutron number ( @xmath5 ) larger than proton number ( @xmath6 ) are expected to have a neutron skin .",
    "the skin thickness is defined as the difference between the neutron and proton root - mean - square ( rms ) radii : @xmath7 .",
    "the neutron skin thickness depends on the balance between various aspects of the nuclear force .",
    "the formation of neutron skin arises because of the large neutron excess and also the difference of potentials for neutron and proton  @xcite .",
    "strong correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ( the slope of symmetry energy ) , @xmath12 ( the curvature of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath10 ) , the ratio @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the symmetry energy coefficient at the saturation density @xmath10 ) , j-@xmath15(@xmath15 is the symmetry energy coefficient of finite nuclei ) have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "these constraints are important for extrapolation of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) to high density and hence useful for studying properties of neutron star .",
    "moreover , a large number of correlations between @xmath8 and several neutron star quantities have also been found , such as ( a ) the pressure of pure neutron matter near saturation density  @xcite , ( b ) neutron star radii  @xcite , ( c ) the crust - to - core transition density  @xcite , and ( d ) the crustal moment of inertia  @xcite .",
    "neutron skin thickness is also closely related with the derivation of volume and surface symmetry energy , as well as nuclear incompressibility with respective to density . furthermore , neutron skin thickness helps to identify a nucleus with exotic structure .",
    "thus the precise determination of neutron skin thickness for a nucleus becomes an important research subject in nuclear physics .",
    "several attempts have been made to determine neutron skin thickness .",
    "these include hadron scattering  @xcite , @xmath16 scattering  @xcite , antiprotonic atoms method  @xcite , giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) method  @xcite , spin - dipole resonance ( sdr ) method  @xcite , gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) method  @xcite etc .",
    "almost all these methods are strongly model dependent due to the complexity of the strong interaction between nucleons . and significant differences exist between these experimental results .",
    "the pb radius experiment ( prex ) at jefferson laboratory , has initiated a new line of research based on the parity - violating elastic electron scattering to measure the neutron density radius  @xcite .",
    "although parity - violating elastic electron scattering provides a model independent measurement of neutron distributions , its current precision is far from satisfactory and the method can not be applied to unstable isotopes .    by using the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) model , sun _",
    "et al_. have investigated the neutron to proton ratio @xmath17 of emitted nucleons from projectile with different neutron skin thickness and shown that there is a strong linear relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath2 , especially for peripheral collisions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is proposed as a possible observable for extracting neutron skin size .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to measure precisely the @xmath18 ratio experimentally due to the low detection efficiency for neutrons .",
    "but it is relatively much easier to measure light charged particles . under the coalescence picture for cluster formation , the ratio of triton to @xmath0he ( r(t/@xmath0he ) ) is expected to be proportional to the @xmath18 ratio . and",
    "r(t/@xmath0he ) can easily be measured since triton and @xmath0he are charged particles . meanwhile ,",
    "the ratio r(t/@xmath0he ) is also found related with nuclear symmetry energy of neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is also proposed as a possible observable to probe the thermodynamic properties of the fragmenting system  @xcite .",
    "thus the ratio of triton to @xmath0he is an interesting and important physics quantity in nuclear physics . in this paper",
    ", we will explore the relationship between the triton - to-@xmath0he yield ratio r(t/@xmath0he ) and the neutron skin thickness within the framework of iqmd model .",
    "the possibility of extracting the neutron skin thickness for neutron - rich nuclei from measurement of r(t/@xmath0he ) will be investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the iqmd model , the droplet model as well as the initialization of projectile and target . in sec .",
    "iii we present the correlation between the neutron skin thickness and triton - to-@xmath0he yield ratio .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "the quantum - molecular - dynamics ( qmd ) approach is a many - body theory to describe heavy ion collisions from intermediate to relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the qmd model is that it can explicitly treat the many - body state of the collision system and contains correlation effects for all orders .",
    "therefore , the qmd model can provide valuable information about both the collision dynamics and the fragmentation process .",
    "it mainly consists of several parts : initialization of the projectile and the target nucleons , propagation of nucleons in the effective potential , two body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions in a nuclear medium and the pauli blocking .",
    "the iqmd model is based on the general qmd model with explicitly inclusion of isospin degrees of freedom in the mean field , two - body nn collisions and the pauli blocking .",
    "in addition , it is also important that , in initialization of the projectile and target nuclei , the samples of neutrons and protons in phase space should be treated separately since there exists a large difference between neutron and proton density distributions for nuclei far from the @xmath19-stability line .",
    "particularly , for neutron - rich nucleus one should sample a stable initialized nucleus with neutron - skin and therefore one can directly explore the nuclear structure effects through a microscopic transport model . qmd model has been widely and successfully used in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these include nuclear structure  @xcite , particle and fragment production  @xcite , nuclear eos  @xcite , collective flow  @xcite and other subjects  @xcite .    in the iqmd model ,",
    "the wave function for each nucleon is represented by a gaussian wave packet , @xmath20 \\exp\\left[\\frac{i\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{p_i}(t)}{\\hbar}\\right ] ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23th wave pocket in the coordinate and momentum space .",
    "@xmath11 is the width of the wave pocket , which is system - size - dependent  @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 is used in the present study . and",
    "all nucleons interact via mean field and nn collisions .",
    "the nuclear mean field can be parameterized by @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 ( the normal nuclear matter density ) .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the total , neutron , and proton densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is the @xmath33-th component of the isospin degree of freedom , which equals 1 or -1 for neutrons or protons , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath19 and @xmath35 are parameters of the nuclear eos .",

    "@xmath38 mev and @xmath39 are taken , which corresponds to the so - called soft eos .",
    "@xmath40 is the coulomb potential and @xmath41 is yukawa ( surface ) potential .    in the phase space initialization of the projectile and target , the density distributions of proton and neutron",
    "are distinguished from each other .",
    "the neutron and proton densities for the initial projectile and target nuclei in the present iqmd model are taken from the droplet model . in the droplet model  @xcite",
    ", we can change the diffuseness parameter to get different skin size in density distributions , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalization constant which ensures that the integration of the density distribution equals to the number of neutrons ( @xmath23=n ) or protons ( @xmath23=p ) ; @xmath44 is the diffuseness parameter ; @xmath45 is the half density radius of neutron or proton determined by the droplet model  @xcite .",

    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by the droplet model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , trzci@xmath50ska _ et al_. found that the half density radii for neutrons and protons in heavy nuclei are almost the same , but the diffuseness parameter for neutron is larger than that for the proton which determines the neutron skin thickness . especially for neutron - rich nuclei",
    "far from the stability line , a large neutron skin is expected .",
    "therefore , a factor @xmath51 is introduced by us to adjust the diffuseness parameter . in the calculation for neutron - rich nucleus",
    ", @xmath52 = 1.0 is used in eq.([eq3 ] ) for the proton density distribution , while @xmath53 in eq.([eq3 ] ) is changed from 1.0 to 1.5 .",
    "different values of @xmath8 can be deduced from eq.([eq3 ] ) with different @xmath53 values . using the density distributions given by the droplet model",
    ", we can get the initial coordinate of nucleons in the nucleus in terms of the monte carlo sampling method . in the iqmd model",

    "the fermi momentum is calculated by @xmath55^{1/3 } \\qquad i = n , p . \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    to avoid taking an unstable initialization of projectile and target in the iqmd calculation , the stability of the sampled nuclei is strictly checked by the time evolution in the mean field until 200",
    "fm / c at zero temperature according to the average binding energies , rms radii , and density distributions of the neutrons and protons . in the initialization",
    ", the projectile and target nucleus are treated differently .",
    "eligible initialization samples of projectile should meet the following requirements until 200 fm / c : ( @xmath23 ) the average binding energy matches with the experimental data ; ( @xmath56 ) the rms radius is in accordance with the droplet model ; ( @xmath57 ) the neutron skin thickness of projectile averaged on time is consistent with the droplet model . while the target @xmath58c only have to keep stable in the evolution time . using the selected initialization phase space of nuclei in iqmd to simulate the collisions ,",
    "the nuclear fragments are constructed by a coalescence model , in which nucleons with relative momentum smaller than p@xmath59 = 300 mev / c and relative distance smaller than r@xmath59 = 3.5 fm will be combined into a cluster .",
    "and there are many different methods of clusterization  @xcite",
    ". different clustering methods may change the production rate of fragments , but the ratio r(t/@xmath60he ) is less model - dependent and also less affected by other effects  @xcite .",
    "the semi - peripheral collision processes of @xmath3ca and @xmath4ni with @xmath58c target at 50 mev / nucleon are simulated using the iqmd model .",
    "the relationship between triton - to-@xmath60he yield ratio and the neutron skin thickness in the projectile is investigated .",
    "the fragments including neutrons and protons that formed during the evolution of the collision are constructed by the coalescence method . the yield ratio r(n / p ) and r(t/@xmath60he )",
    "can be calculated from the emitted neutrons , protons , tritons and @xmath60he .",
    "it is assumed that the emitted fragments will have a memory of the @xmath61 of the quasiprojectile in peripheral collisions . as the neutron skin thickness increases ,",
    "the neutron - proton composition in the surface of nucleus will also increase .",
    "thus the yield ratio r(t/@xmath60he ) will carry the initial neutron - proton composition ( @xmath61 ) of its emitting source . by changing the factor @xmath53 in the neutron density distribution of the droplet model for the projectile , different values of @xmath8 and the corresponding r(n / p ) and r(t/@xmath0he )",
    "are obtained .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the correlation between r(n / p ) , r(t/@xmath0he ) and @xmath8 .    since the main purpose of the present work is to study the effect of neutron skin thickness of the projectile on the yield ratio of emitted particles .",
    "the calculation will focus on the production of fragment from the projectile in semi - peripheral collision .",
    "the reduced impact parameter is used to describe the centrality of collision which is defined as @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the maximum impact parameter . since the main difference between neutron and proton density distribution is in the surface of nucleus",
    ", the probe r(t/@xmath0he ) may be much more sensitive in peripheral collisions . while the statistics also need to be taken into account .",
    "thus @xmath64 is used in the calculation . in order to minimize the target effect on r(n / p ) and r(t/@xmath0he ) , we use rapidity ( @xmath65 ) cut to select neutrons , protons , tritons and @xmath60he emitted from the projectile .",
    "the rapidity of the fragments normalized to the incident projectile rapidity is defined as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy of the fragment , @xmath68 is the momentum of fragment in @xmath33 direction and @xmath69 is the rapidity of the projectile .",
    "all calculations are carried out in the center - of - mass system ( cms ) .    in the calculation , the time evolution of the dynamical process was simulated until t=200 fm / c . as shown in fig .",
    "[ th_t ] , the yields of produced tritons and @xmath60he ( upper panel ) , together with the corresponding r(t/@xmath0he ) and also r(n / p ) ( lower panel ) are stable after 100 fm / c . from fig .",
    "[ th_t](b ) , one can see that r(t/@xmath0he ) is larger than r(n / p ) throughout the whole evolution process",
    ". the reason may be that it is easier to combine a neutron into a cluster than a proton due to the coulomb repulsion as well as the neutron - rich environment . in order to improve statistics we accumulate the emitted neutrons , protons , tritons and @xmath60he between 150 fm / c and 200 fm / c .    while analyzing the rapidity distribution of different fragments in semi - peripheral collisions , an interesting phenomenon was found as shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_y ] . for a certain kind of light cluster",
    ", there are more particles distributing in the target - like region rather than in the projectile - like region , which is contrary to our expectation .",
    "the rapidity distribution of neutrons , protons , tritons and @xmath60he are shown in fig .",
    "[ ydis ] respectively . from the figure",
    "one can see that there are more neutrons and protons in projectile - like region , while for tritons and @xmath60he it is opposite . to better understand what happened in the collision process , we followed the tracks of the nucleons in the whole collision process .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath58c target is much easier to break up than the neutron - rich projectiles @xmath3ca and @xmath4ni .",
    "this can be explained as a geometry effect . in semi - peripheral collision of such an asymmetry system ,",
    "the target is almost penetrated by nucleons from the projectile since the size of the projectile is much larger than the target . while only a limited part of nucleons in the projectile is abraded .",
    "the rapidity distribution of r(n / p ) and r(t/@xmath0he ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ rnpth_y ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that the ratio corresponding to @xmath70=3 clusters indeed displays a similar rapidity dependence to that of the emitted neutrons and protons , though opposite rapidity dependence in their yields as discussed above .",
    "from this figure , we can see that r(n / p ) and r(t/@xmath0he ) in projectile - like region are much larger than that in the target - like region .",
    "this is because the neutron - rich projectile will produce more neutrons than protons .",
    "however , what we are interested in is the fragments produced from the neutron - rich projectile , so we make a cut of rapidity @xmath71 to strip away fragments coming from the target . on the other hand ,",
    "the yield ratios are much more sensitive to the surface of the nucleus , so only the events with the reduced impact parameter from 0.6 to 1.0 are taken into account .",
    "the yields of neutrons , protons , tritons and @xmath0he are selected under the condition with @xmath64 and @xmath71 and the emitted time from 150 fm / c and 200 fm / c .",
    "the corresponding ratios r(t/@xmath0he ) and r(n / p ) with respect to the neutron skin thickness for @xmath3ca+@xmath58c and @xmath4ni+@xmath58c systems are plotted in fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] . a strong linear correlation between r(t/@xmath0he ) , r(n / p ) and @xmath8 is exhibited , which indicates that both r(t/@xmath0he ) and r(n / p ) are sensitive to @xmath8 . and",
    "r(t/@xmath0he ) is always larger than r(n / p ) as mentioned previously .",
    "the double ratios r(t/@xmath0he)/r(n / p ) as a function of @xmath8 for both @xmath3ca+@xmath58c and @xmath4ni+@xmath58c systems are plotted in fig .",
    "[ rthrnp ] .",
    "one can see that , with the increasing of the neutron skin thickness , the double ratio r(t/@xmath0he)/r(n / p ) is almost constant , which indicates that r(t/@xmath0he ) is proportional to the @xmath18 ratio for different @xmath8 , which is consistent with the coalescence method .",
    "thus both r(t/@xmath0he ) and r(n / p ) could be used as experimental observables for determination of the neutron skin thickness .",
    "however , r(t/@xmath0he ) will be a better quantity from the experimental point of view since the charged particles triton and @xmath0he could be measured much easier than neutrons . to see the linear relation between r(t/@xmath0he ) and the neutron skin thickness will be changed or not by varying the parameters in iqmd model , effect of the width of gaussian wave packet ( @xmath11 ) is investigated .",
    "the results show that a small change in @xmath11 has almost no effect on r(t/@xmath0he ) and its linear dependence on neutron skin thickness .",
    "the system of @xmath72ca+@xmath58c is calculated to study the effect of neutrons in the projectile , the value of r(t/@xmath0he ) will decrease by about 7@xmath73 compared with @xmath3ca+@xmath58c which is consistent with the change of @xmath61 from @xmath3ca ( 1.5 ) to @xmath72ca ( 1.4 ) .",
    "but the slope of linear dependence between r(t/@xmath0he ) and @xmath8 is the same .",
    "furthermore , the effect of mdi interaction is studied . with the mdi potential ,",
    "the system becomes unstable and it is very difficult to have stable initial samples compared with the eos without mdi interaction .",
    "further investigation is necessary for understanding the effect of mdi interaction on the relation between r(t/@xmath0he ) and @xmath8 .",
    "within the framework of the iqmd model in which the initial neutron and proton densities are sampled according to the droplet model , we have simulated the semi - peripheral collisions of 50 mev / nucleon @xmath3ca and @xmath4ni on a @xmath58c target . assuming different neutron skin thickness for the projectile",
    ", we have studied the correlation between triton - to-@xmath0he yield ratio and neutron skin thickness for the first time .",
    "a strong linear relationship is obtained between r(t/@xmath0he ) and @xmath8 for neutron - rich projectile , similar with the relationship between r(n / p ) and @xmath8 . since light charged particles could be measured easily in experiment as compared with neutrons , r(t/@xmath0he )",
    "could be regarded as a sensitive and practical observable of @xmath8 for neutron - rich nuclei . if the emitted tritons and @xmath60he are measured by experiment , it is possible to extract @xmath8 from r(t/@xmath0he ) .",
    "furthermore , some information about the nuclear equation of state could be deduced after the determination of neutron skin thickness from the experimental measurements .",
