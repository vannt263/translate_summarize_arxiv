    "experimental results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have confirmed the formation of a hot and dense medium in the initial stages of high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "thus one of the prerequisites for the formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite in such collisions has been established .",
    "high statistics data on @xmath0 meson elliptic flow and yields as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) have been used to support the picture of formation of a hot and dense medium with partonic collectivity at rhic  @xcite .",
    "evidence of @xmath0 mesons being formed by the coalescence of seemingly thermalized @xmath12-quarks in central au+au collisions has also been presented  @xcite .",
    "several interesting features were also observed in the centrality dependence of @xmath0 meson production in au+au collisions at 200 gev .",
    "as one goes from central collisions ( average number of participants , @xmath13 , @xmath14 166 ) to peripheral collisions ( @xmath13 @xmath7 77 ) , the @xmath15 spectra showed a gradual evolution from an exponential shape to a shape which requires an additional power law type of behavior at higher @xmath15 ( @xmath14 3 gev/@xmath9 )  @xcite . at the same time , the average transverse momentum ( @xmath16@xmath8@xmath17 ) of @xmath0 mesons , dominated by the transverse momentum distribution at low @xmath8 , showed no significant collision centrality dependence in au+au collisions , unlike what has been seen for other particles of similar mass such as anti - protons ( @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19/@xmath20 ratio was observed to be independent of collision centrality in au+au collisions , in contrast to predictions from microscopic transport models like rqmd and urqmd  @xcite .",
    "both of these results led to the conclusion that @xmath0 meson production may not be from @xmath21 coalescence and @xmath0 mesons may have decoupled early on in the collisions  @xcite .",
    "the linear increase of the @xmath22 ratio with @xmath8 was proposed as an observable to test the recombination picture and hence also provided a test for thermalization in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "a distinct trend was observed in the centrality dependence of this ratio vs. @xmath8 in au+au collisions  @xcite . with decreasing centrality , the observed @xmath22 ratio seems to turn over at successively lower values of @xmath8 indicating a smaller contribution from thermal quark coalescence in more peripheral collisions .",
    "furthermore , in lower energy collisions at the sps  @xcite and ags  @xcite , it was observed that the relative strangeness production increases with @xmath23 . for similar @xmath23 ,",
    "the increase was found to be slower for larger colliding ions .",
    "the possible reason was related to variations of space - time density of the participating nucleons and the increase in collision density ( interactions per @xmath24 ) towards the center of the reaction volume  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 production in cu+cu collisions , in which systems with @xmath23 @xmath7 128 are created , is therefore expected to provide more precise data to further probe these centrality and colliding ion size dependent features .    in this letter",

    "production by this process is not suppressed as per the ozi ( okubo - zweig - izuka ) rule  @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with large abundances of strange quarks in the plasma , may lead to a dramatic increase in the production of @xmath0 mesons and other strange hadrons relative to non - qgp @xmath10+@xmath10 collisions  @xcite .",
    "alternative ideas of canonical suppression of strangeness in small systems as a source of strangeness enhancement in high energy heavy - ion collisions have been proposed for other strange hadrons ( e.g @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "the strangeness conservation laws require the production of an @xmath27-quark for each @xmath26-quark in the strong interaction .",
    "the main argument in such canonical models is that the energy and space time extensions in smaller systems may not be sufficiently large .",

    "this in turn suggests that the observed centrality dependence of the enhancement for other strange hadrons ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) is likely to be related to the same reasons as in the case of the @xmath0 meson , that it is due to the formation of a dense partonic medium in the collisions .",

    "the corresponding results for the nuclear modification factor , scaled by the number of binary collisions , are in general found to be higher for cu+cu compared to au+au collisions .",

    "the colliding beam energy is high , so it is very unlikely that the observed enhancement in heavy - ion collisions is due to ozi suppression of @xmath0 production in @xmath10+@xmath10 collisions .",
