    "in recent years , there has been a remarkable upturn in experimental work reporting the formation of highly unusual correlated many - body states in materials with partially occupied @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "examples include observation of the topologically protected metallic surface states in canonical kondo insulator smb@xmath7,@xcite violation of the wiedmann - franz law in ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8,@xcite intrinsic non - fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity in @xmath9-ybalb@xmath10,@xcite rotational symmetry breaking inside the hidden - order phase in uru@xmath8si@xmath8,@xcite and cooperative states in superconducting alloys ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3.@xcite despite many years of experimental and theoretical research , however , many of these phenomena  with the possible exception of metallic states with dirac spectrum in smb@xmath7are still poorly understood and are often a subject of controversy .",
    "what is common to all these phenomena is that they are driven not only by the strong local correlations between the @xmath0-electrons , but also by the non - local interactions between the conduction and @xmath0-electrons.@xcite in particular , large enough repulsion between the @xmath0-electrons may lead to a significant energy separation between the two ionic configurations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , thus leading to the formation of the local magnetic moments.@xcite at the same time , in other cases , even in the presence of strong coulomb interactions , the energy of the two ionic configurations becomes comparable , so that the local moments do not form and the @xmath0-ions are in an intermediate valence state.@xcite how unconventional superconductivity emerges in the @xmath0-orbital materials that appear to be either in the local moment or mixed valence regime still remains one of the most fundamental problems .",
    "one way to tune the relevant energy scales in order to study the physics of the crossover from kondo - lattice to kondo - impurity behavior is to introduce substitutional disorder on the @xmath0-electron sites . in the case of the unconventional superconductor cecoin@xmath3a member of the family of ce - based  115  compounds @xcite",
    " it is done by replacing a ce ion with a non - magnetic one ( la ) .",
    "@xcite as another possibility , the substitution of magnetic ( yb ) ions on the ce sites provides an extra dimension to the problem:@xcite since yb ions are in the mixed valence state of yb@xmath13 ( non - magnetic valence configuration ) and yb@xmath14 ( magnetic valence configuration),@xcite one can study not only how normal and superconducting states evolve as the alloy crosses over from the predominantly local - moment ( @xmath15 ) to the mixed - valence ( @xmath16 ) regime , but also the problem of the kondo impurity in the heavy - fermion metal when @xmath17 .",
    "strong hybridization between the conduction and @xmath0-orbitals leads to the significant enhancement of the effective mass of the charge carriers at low - temperatures as well as emergence of the effective energy scale @xmath18 , which is much smaller then the conduction electron fermi energy .",
    "thus , the onset of unconventional superconductivity at a superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath19 ) around 2.3 k in cecoin@xmath3 relegates this material to the class of high - temperature superconductors since @xmath20 only .",
    "the origin of such a high ( compared to @xmath18 ) transition temperature is thought to be due to system s proximity to a magnetic field induced quantum phase transition , so that strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations provide the source of strong superconducting coupling for the heavy electrons and consequently yield the relatively high value of the superconducting transition temperature.@xcite    recently , the idea of unconventional superconductivity induced by the proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point in cecoin@xmath3 has been challenged by the systematic study of the superconducting alloys ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3.@xcite in particular , the evolution of the critical field ( @xmath21 ) along the @xmath22-axis at which the quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases takes place @xcite has been studied as a function of yb concentration .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of @xmath21 can be extracted from both normal and superconducting states .",
    "the authors @xcite found that the value of @xmath21 is significantly reduced for @xmath23 and vanishes as @xmath24 . yet , at the same time , the value of the superconducting critical temperature is reduced by only about 15% at @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the critical temperature is reduced only by half at @xmath26 ; this is completely unexpected for an unconventional superconductor given the fact that ytterbium ions are in a mixed valence state with the average valence of @xmath27,@xcite so that the magnetic valence state of yb@xmath14 together with essentially unscreened cerium moments should provide enough scattering to completely suppress superconductivity .",
    "thus , previously reported robustness of the unconventional superconductivity in ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3 for intermediate values of yb concentrations @xcite represents a major challenge to our understanding of the physics of this @xmath0-electron alloy .    in this paper",
    ", we report the results of a systematic transport and thermodynamic study of the ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3 alloy , mostly focusing on the intermediate range of concentrations , @xmath28 . as we have already mentioned above",
    ", the effect of relatively small yb substitution @xmath29 ) is very dramatic on the physics related to the presence of the magnetic quantum critical point.@xcite in the intermediate doping range , however , we observe a crossover from coherent cerium kondo lattice behavior to a coherent many - body state formed by the strong hybridization between conduction electrons and ytterbium @xmath0-electrons .",
    "we note that the temperature ( @xmath30 ) at which resistivity reaches its peak , referred to as coherence temperature in the text , has a minimum as a function of yb concentration at @xmath31 , signaling the reconstruction of the fermi surface , in agreement with the recent quantum oscillations experiments.@xcite on the other hand , the monotonic dependence@xcite of @xmath19 on @xmath32 suggests that the onset of many - body coherence in the lattice of yb ions diluted with ce @xmath0-moments is decoupled from unconventional superconductivity . moreover , our observation of the single impurity kondo behavior of ce ions in magneto - transport for @xmath33 points toward an intriguing possibility that unconventional superconductivity has purely local origin and is driven by the presence of ce @xmath0-moments .",
    "single crystals of ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) were grown using an indium self - flux method . the crystal structure and composition",
    "were determined from x - ray powder diffraction and energy dispersive x - ray techniques .",
    "the single crystals studied have a typical size of @xmath35 mm@xmath36 , with the @xmath22-axis along the shortest dimension of the crystals .",
    "they were etched in concentrated hcl for several hours to remove the indium left on the surface during the growth process and were then rinsed thoroughly in ethanol .",
    "the electrical transport measurements were carried out on a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) platform .",
    "the sample is cooled by flowing cold helium vapor across the sample space . a heater located near the sample",
    "regulates the amount of cooling that is received by the sample , while a thermometer located near the sample allows continuous and automatic control of the sample temperature .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed using a standard four probe technique .",
    "four electrodes were attached to the @xmath37 surface of the single crystals by bonding au wires to the crystals with h20e epoxy paste and curing it at @xmath38c for 5 minutes .",
    "the electrical current @xmath39 was applied parallel to the @xmath40-axis of the single crystals and the magnetic field @xmath41 ( up to 14 t ) was applied parallel to the @xmath22-axis of the crystals .",
    "we performed magnetoresistivity measurements under pressure on the @xmath42 sample .",
    "the single crystal was mounted in a clamped piston - cylinder pressure cell along with a piece of tin wire .",
    "a 50:50 mixture of n - pentane and iso - pentane was used as hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature of tin was measured in order to determine the actual pressure inside the pressure cell at low temperatures , when the pressure transmiting fluid freezes .",
    "we performed heat capacity measurements on all the single crystals studied for temperatures ( @xmath43 ) between 1.9 k and 5 k in a quantum design ppms semi - adiabatic calorimeter using a heat - pulse technique .",
    "the masses of the single crystals used in these measurements were in the range 1.2 mg to 2.7 mg .",
    "dependence of electrical resistivity @xmath44 normalized to its value at 300 k for single crystals with different yb doping ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the arrow on the top marks the coherence temperatures @xmath30 , corresponding to the maximum of resistivity .",
    "inset : coherence temperature @xmath30 vs yb doping @xmath32 . ]    figure [ fig1](a ) shows the @xmath43 dependence of the electrical resistivity ( @xmath45 ) normalized to its value at 300 k of the single crystals used in the present study ( @xmath4 ) . in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the dependence of @xmath30 on yb doping .",
    "we notice that @xmath30 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath32 up to @xmath46 and then it increases with further increasing @xmath32 .",
    "this indicates that the cerium kondo lattice coherence initially becomes weaker , due to the dilution of the ce kondo lattice with increasing yb doping , and then the coherence in the system is re - established for yb doping higher than 65% .",
    "therefore , this suggests that the coherent many - body state formed by the conduction electrons and cerium @xmath0-moments is fully destroyed at @xmath46 and a new coherent state emerges due to the interaction between the conduction electrons and ytterbium @xmath0-electrons as if it becomes energetically favorable for the conduction electrons to start hybridizing strongly with ytterbium ions in the lattice .",
    "it is also important to note , that our subsequent analysis in section iii.c .",
    "reveals that cerium ions for the @xmath47 sample are not fully in a single - impurity regime either , while the resistivity decreases with temperature  a clear sign of a coherent metallic state . keeping in mind the results of the recent cyclotron resonance data,@xcite which show substantial reconstruction of the fermi surfaces for @xmath48",
    ", we conclude that the coherence is re - established for @xmath49 due to the onset of strong hybridization between the conduction electrons and yb @xmath0-electrons , while the ce moments become decoupled from the conduction band .      at small concentrations @xmath32 of ytterbium ions , the kondo lattice coherence temperature appears to be only slowly suppressed with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the correlations between yb impurities play an important role .",
    "it has been shown through a combination of x - ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy techniques@xcite that the average yb valence in ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3 decreases monotonically from @xmath50 to @xmath51 with increasing yb from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and then it remains constant for @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , upon the substitution of ytterbium on cerium sites , an ytterbium ion finds itself in a mixed valence state .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that the process during which an ytterbium ion changes its valence is a dynamical one .",
    "yb has thirteen @xmath0-electrons in its magnetic state , while it has fourteen @xmath0-electrons in its non - magnetic state .",
    "thus , a transition of yb from its magnetic to non - magnetic state results in an extra @xmath0-electron and hence an increase in the local volume around yb .",
    "theoretically , this increase in the local volume is naturally described by introducing the strain dependent hybridization between the conduction and @xmath0-states of ytterbium.@xcite of course , the conduction electrons may induce yb - yb correlations via an analog of the famous ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) mechanism .",
    "however , theoretical estimates by dzero and huang show that the lattice strain serves as a mediator between two ytterbium ions and leads to an increase in the pair correlation radius between yb impurities.@xcite in addition , they have shown that the presence of yb - yb correlations in a mixed valence alloy must result in a non - linear dependence of the residual resistivity ( @xmath55 ) on @xmath32 , with a _ positive quadratic _ increase of @xmath56 , indicating that the effective interactions between ytterbium ions are predominantly attractive .",
    "also , their theory predicts that the impurity correlations have a healing effect on the formation of the many - body states ; i.e. , both the kondo lattice coherence temperature and superconducting critical temperature are expected to decrease at a much lower rate compared to the case when yb ions are uncorrelated or repel each other .",
    "@xcite this conclusion is consistent with the slow suppression of coherence and superconductivity@xcite in ce@xmath1yb@xmath2coin@xmath3 compared with other rare - earth substitutions on the ce - site.@xcite     as a function of yb doping , for single crystals with @xmath57 .",
    "the error bars of @xmath56 are the standard errors given by the fitting routine and they are within the symbols size .",

    "we note that the non - monotonic @xmath56 is expected since the increase in @xmath56 and the corresponding maximum for @xmath65 appear as a consequence of introducing disorder by the yb substitution into the ordered host .",
    "lastly , we note that the reason for choosing the temperature dependence given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) was discussed in details elsewhere.@xcite here we want to mention that the presence of critical fluctuations at lower yb doping ( @xmath66 ) gives rise to the linear @xmath43-dependent contribution , while the @xmath67 contribution is attributed to the cooperative mixed valence state of yb . the left inset to fig .",

    "the data for all the doping studied fall under three groups : ( i ) a positive contribution to mr for low @xmath41 values followed by a negative @xmath77 dependence at higher @xmath41 values for @xmath66 [ fig .

    "therefore , the results of figs . [ fig3 ] are consistent with the non - monotonic @xmath80 dependence ( inset to fig . 1 ) and confirm that the coherence effects are stronger in low- and high - yb - doped samples , while incoherent scattering dominates the contribution to mr for the intermediate yb doping range .    a further analysis of the magnetoresistivity data based on schlottmann scaling @xcite confirms the above findings .",
