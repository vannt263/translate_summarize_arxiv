    "_ iras _ galaxy surveys at 60 @xmath0 m have consistently provided good evidence for a population of star forming galaxies evolving with a strength comparable to agn .",

    "this evolving population discovered by _ iras _ could have very important implications for cosmological studies .",
    "in particular these objects are likely to contribute strongly to the star formation history of the universe .",
    "[ other incidental issues include the possibly significant impact such objects could have on the cosmological far infrared background e.g. oliver _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) and franceschini _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) . ]",
    "the populations seen by _ iras _ are mostly relatively low redshift ( @xmath5 ) ; deeper _ iso _ surveys such as this provide a longer baseline in redshift giving a better handle on the nature of the evolution .",
    "this paper will discuss the source counts from our maps of the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams _",
    "our observations have been described by serjeant _",
    "( 1997 ; paper i ) and the source extraction described by goldschmidt _",
    "( 1997 ; paper ii ) : a total of 27 sources were found at 6.7 @xmath0 m , and 22 at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "further papers discuss the associations with optical galaxies ( mann _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; paper iv ) and the models for spectral energy distributions and the star formation history rowan - robinson _",
    "( 1997 ; paper v ) .",
    "in paper ii we detected 7 sources in our 6.7 @xmath0 m maps and 19 in our 15 @xmath0 m maps using a well defined source detection algorithm . to convert these source lists into source counts requires an estimate of the area within which a source of observed flux ( @xmath6 ) could have been detected .    to estimate this we need to know the minimum flux ( @xmath7 ) detectable at any position .",
    "the source detection algorithm requires @xmath8 pixels to have intensity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the threshold intensity .",
    "the flux of resulting detections is estimated using an estimated local background intensity @xmath11 . assuming a well determined point spread function ( psf ) , @xmath12 , this algorithm gives us a detection limit @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a function giving the @xmath8th largest value .",
    "@xmath15 is defined for various areas in paper ii and @xmath16 is determined by running the sky annulus across the full image .",
    "the psf is the only uncertainty in this estimate of the survey areas , we thus decided to investigate this in some detail .",
    "one estimate for @xmath17 comes from the standard esa products .",
    "the psf is estimated at @xmath18 sub pixel positions for each filter and lens position .",
    "we drizzled these images together to produce a single psf for each of our two observing modes . for both bands ,",
    "the esa psf contains a large amount of flux in the wings .",
    "these wings may be caused by scattered light or other data reduction features in the esa psf . in any case",
    "we can not use the psf for analysing the effective area since only 20 per cent of the total flux is within the airy disk , so we calculate a ` revised ' esa psf which is background subtracted in the same way as were the sources and normalised to 1 within the source aperture . since our observations involved long integrations , in which jitter might significantly blur the psf , and also because our data reduction did not take into account field distortions , we decided to estimate @xmath17 empirically from the hdf observations themselves .",
    "@xmath17 was estimated by summing the intensities from a number of sources in an square aperture 7 pixels to a side ( i.e. 7 arcsec at 6.7 @xmath0 m and 21 arcsec at 15 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the relatively small aperture at 6.7 @xmath0 m was necessary to avoid including more than one source . at 15 @xmath0 m we excluded objects near the boundaries and the fainter sources leaving a sample of 6 sources , while at 6.7 @xmath0 m we used all sources in the complete sample .",
    "we then normalised such that @xmath19 over the aperture .",
    "some parameters of the psfs discussed are summarised in table [ psf ]    .characteristics of various point spread functions : column 1 , peak intensity ; column 2 , full width half maximum ; column3 flux within twice the nominal airy disk diameter ; column 4 , intensity in @xmath8th brightest pixel ( pixels are 1 arcsec at 6.7 @xmath0 m and 3 arcsec at 15 @xmath0 m [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     using the area of the survey to a given flux limit ( figures [ area7 ] and [ area15 ] ) and the number count models of section [ models ] we can estimate the number of sources of any given type that we would expect in this survey , these numbers are summarised in tables [ cppexp7],[cppexp15],[afexp7],[afexp15 ] .",
    "both models are consistent with the total number of associated galaxies .",
    "the simulation at 15 @xmath0 m predicts that there should be 8.37 objects but our non - associated list includes 16 galaxies .",
    "this is a marginally significant excess and may indicate that either our association requirements are too harsh or that our simulated noise is not realistic ; improved understanding of the _ iso _ data in the near future will clarify this .",
    "interestingly the prr model predicts a significant fraction of objects ( @xmath20 per cent ) of the objects should be at fluxes brighter than our brightest source .",
    "this discrepancy is also seen in the integral count plots ( figure  [ cpp_7 ] ) , where we can also see a apparent difference in slope between the model and the data .    to test whether discrepancies in the count slope are significant we perform a k - s test to assess the probability of the observed fluxes being drawn from a count distribution with the same shape as the models ( or single components of the models ) ,",
    "these probabilities are given in tables[cppexp7],[cppexp15],[afexp7],[afexp15 ] .",
    "these results suggest that the prr model at 6.7 @xmath0 m is ruled out with more than 99 per cent significance ( using either the simulations or raw models ) , this is mainly due to the expected fraction of bright objects .",
    "this model can not be ruled out with more than 95 per cent confidence at the other wavelength although the simulation implies a more significant discrepancy , this may again suggest problems with our simulations or association criteria .    in this test",
    "the af model can also not be rejected with any high level of confidence ( more than around 95 percent ) at either wavelength .",
    "it thus appears that these data are insufficient to rule out either model at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "the prr model can be ruled out at the shorter wavelength due to the high fraction of bright galaxies predicted .",
    "it may be that revisions to the k - corrections of the `` normal '' component using improved seds may be sufficient to improve this model .",
    "possibly problems with the `` normal '' component sed are also suggested by the noticeable over - prediction of the _ iras _ 15 @xmath0 m counts in the model .",
    "a `` no evolution '' version of the prr star - burst component would predict only 0.28 galaxies 15 @xmath0 m i.e. 4.5 in total . since we comfortably detect 11 galaxies such a model can be ruled out at the 3 @xmath21 level on integral counts alone .",
    "since our maps are close to the _ iso _ confusion limit it is sensible to examine the low level fluctuations in the maps on a statistical level .",
    "this allows us to investigate source count models below the flux level at which individual sources can be resolved . to this end",
    "we explore the distribution of deviations in flux in a given aperture from the mean level , the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "this analysis avoids the need for any source detection algorithm .",
    "the fluctuations in a map about the mean intensity consist of two components .",
    "the first is the noise which will have both positive and negative values , and will have some distribution function which we shall assume is gaussian .",
    "the second is true fluctuations .",
    "these might arise from sources , cosmological background or galactic foreground .",
    "in all cases this contribution will always be positive and thus skew a symmetric noise distribution . in this case",
    "we assume that any major asymmetric component arises from extra - galactic sources .",
    "firstly we select sky regions and construct a histogram of flux deviations in square apertures .",
    "these histograms are fitted with both gaussian distributions functions and the expected distribution functions from the source count models .",
    "these model distribution functions are calculated following franceschini _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) and using the af model for the source counts discussed above ( the differential counts of this model are similar to those from the prr model below the source detection limit so the af model results will be similar for both , and the model provides a better fit to the count distribution at 6.7 @xmath0 m ) . the differential count distribution is first convolved with a model psf ( in this case a gaussian psf is assumed ) to give the response function to single sources in the selected aperture .",
    "the @xmath2 can then be calculated assuming the sources are distributed on the sky as a poisson process .",
    "figure [ pd15 ] shows the deflection distribution ( @xmath22 in @xmath0jy ) obtained from a 72x72 matrix of pixels derived from the inner portion of the drizzled mosaic of paper i. we estimate a sky standard deviation in the inner map _ outside _ obvious sources of @xmath23jy / aperture .",
    "( dotted line in the figure [ pd15 ] ) .",
    "the aperture is 6x6 arcsec@xmath24 area , enclosing a disc with diameter equal to the fwhm of the theoretical psf .",
    "the mean intensity was 0.4 mjy arcsec@xmath25 .",
    "the continuous thick line is the convolution of the gaussian noise with a model @xmath2 based on the counts appearing in figure [ af_15 ] .",
    "the convolved curve provides a very good fit to the data ( reduced @xmath26 ) .",
    "a simple gaussian can not fit the data , even if the width is increased to @xmath27jy aperture@xmath28 with reduced @xmath29 .",
    "thus there is a clear positive signal in the @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the background in an extremely deep _ iso _ exposure at @xmath30 m is structured .",
    "such structure is entirely consistent with being due to an smooth extrapolation of the _ iso _ source counts observed above the flux threshold , and confirms the counts .",
    "this @xmath2 analysis allows us to further constrain the models .",
    "the shape of the af model counts was fixed and the normalisation allowed to vary .",
    "these constraints are illustrated in figure [ af_15 ]    a similar analysis at 6.7 @xmath0 m demonstrated that a simple gaussian noise model was sufficient to provide a good fit to the observed @xmath2 .",
    "this allowed only an upper limit on the normalisation of the counts to be determined .",
    "so far we have not made any use of the fact that our survey was conducted in the hubble deep field and flanking fields where there is exceptional photometric and spectroscopy information available .",
    "these data allows us to determine the populations detected by _ iso_. it is still instructive to compare observed and predicted populations as this may provide clues for improvements to the models .",
    "one of the 6.7 @xmath0 m sources ( _ iso_hdf2 j123646.4 + 621406 ) selected at 6.7 @xmath0 m has broad emission lines ( paper iv ) .",
    "this is compatible with the predicted numbers of agn in both of the models we have considered . of the remaining 4 associated objects",
    "only one is compatible with a normal cirrus spectrum galaxy and has an elliptical morphology , the others are better fitted with star - burst spectra and have spiral morphologies ( paper v ) .    excluding agn , the first of the models ( prr ) suggests that at 6.7 @xmath0 m our sample should have a majority ( 71 per cent ) of normal spiral galaxies with around 28 per cent star - burst galaxies .",
    "the expected probability of getting the observed one or fewer cirrus galaxies in a sample of 4 is @xmath31 per cent .",
    "although the statistics are very poor this casts further doubt on the validity of prr model at this wavelength .",
    "the classification of seds in paper v is based mainly on the optical / ir luminosities .",
    "extra information comes from the expected redshift distribution of these normal galaxies and star - bursts which is shown in figure [ cppz7 ] .",
    "a k - s test can not rule out the possibility that the observed redshifts are drawn from the model distribution even if the redshift of the broad lined object is included : the probability of the data being drawn from the model distribution is 0.18 .",
    "paper v does not attempt to fit seds of the type used for the second model .",
    "however , this model predicts that the non - agn 6.7 @xmath0 m sources would be 61 per cent elliptical or s0 and 39 per cent spirals .",
    "this is reasonably consistent with the morphologies and seds above .    only three of the 15 @xmath0 m selected sources are associated within the hdf itself .",
    "two of these have spiral morphologies and are fitted by star - burst spectra , while the third has elliptical morphology and a cirrus spectrum . with such limited statistics",
    "this is reasonably compatible with both models . including the flanking field areas we find in paper iv that six of the 15 @xmath0 m selected sources have associations and redshifts ( or photometric redshifts ) .",
    "these are shown in figure [ cppz15 ] together with the redshift distribution from the prr model . excluding the lowest redshift object , ( which was excluded from our count analysis as being below the 255mjy flux limit that was also applied to our model redshift distributions ) we find that we can not rule out these redshifts being drawn from this expected distribution ( probability 0.41 ) .",
    "this test is hampered by small number statistics but also assumes that the objects in the flanking fields with redshifts are not biased in any way .",
    "clearly obtaining spectra for the flanking field 15 @xmath0 m sources is a high priority .",
    "the fact that we have reached the _ iso _ confusion limit at 15 @xmath0ms with a sensitivity of around 0.2 mjy has important implications for other surveys and missions , in particular nasa s small explorer mission , the _ wide - field infrared explorer _",
    "( _ wire _ , http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/wire/ ) .",
    "_ wire _ is due for launch in september 1998 and plans to survey hundreds of square degrees at 12 and 25 @xmath0 m .",
    "the _ wire _ strategy is divided into three parts : part i  a moderate - depth survey ( 60 percent of survey time ) ; part ii  a deep , confusion - limited survey ( 30 per cent of the survey time ) and part iii  an ultra - deep , confusion - distribution measurement .",
    "the areal coverage and integration times will be designed to achieve these aims and so the best estimate of the confusion limit is required prior to planning .",
    "currently the _ wire _ team estimate confusion limits of between 0.067 mjy and 0.15 mjy at 12 @xmath0 m ( http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/wire/sensitiv.html ) depending on the evolutionary models . _",
    "wire _ has a 30 cm mirror with poorer resolution than _ iso _ so our results suggest that the confusion limit for _ wire _ will be brighter than these estimates .",
    "we have investigated the source counts of our _ iso _ observations at 6.7 and 15 @xmath0 m of the hubble deep field .",
    "these are the deepest available in the mid to far infrared wave - bands , 3 decades fainter than _ iras _ at 15 @xmath0 m and the first ever presentation of extra - galactic source counts at 6.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "we reach 50@xmath0jy over 5 arcmin@xmath24 at 6.7 @xmath0 m , at 15 @xmath0 m we cover 5 arcmin@xmath24 to a depth 200@xmath0jy and around 15 arcmin@xmath24 to 400 @xmath0jy . in both bands",
    "we cover smaller areas to deeper flux limits .",

    "_ 1997 ) , the cam deep survey ( see e.g. elbaz 1997 ) and the survey of taniguchi _ et al . _",
    "both the source counts and a @xmath2 analysis indicate that we have reached the confusion limit of _ iso _ at 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "this will have important implications for the construction of mid - infrared surveys with future space missions such as _ wire_. at 6.7 @xmath0 m we are close to the confusion limit but have not yet reached it . at 15 @xmath0 m",
    "a no - evolution model is ruled out at @xmath3 providing important confirmation of the strong evolution seen in _ iras _ surveys at a much greater depth .",
    "the counts appear to be steeper than expected from one a priori galaxy evolution model at 6.7 @xmath0 m although the significance of this is dependent on our assumptions about the calibration and noise properties of the data and the fir sed of the model which will improve with time .",
