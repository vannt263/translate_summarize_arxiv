    "as has been known for long , the combination of relativistic and quantum effects implies that the conventional notion of distance breaks down the latest at the planck scale , which is about @xmath1 .",
    "the basic argument is that the resolution of small distances requires test particles of short wavelength and thus of high energy . at sufficiently small scale ,",
    "i.e. close to the planck scale , the gravitational effect of the test particle s energy significantly disturbs the space - time structure which was tried .",
    "studies on gedanken experiments therefore suggest the existence of a finite limit @xmath0 to the possible resolution of distances .",
    "string theory , as a theory of quantum gravity , should allow a deeper understanding of what could happen at such extreme scales .",
    "indeed , several studies in string theory yielded a certain type of correction to the uncertainty relation x p ( 1 + ( p)^2 + ... ) ,  > 0 [ ucr ] which , as is easily verified , implies a finite minimal uncertainty @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 can be viewed as a fuzzyness of space , or also as a consequence of the nonpointlikeness of the fundamental particles .",
    "it seems that , in string theory , intuitively , the input of more energy does eventually no longer allow to improve the spatial resolution , as this energy starts to enlarge the probed string .",
    "references are e.g. @xcite-@xcite , and recently @xcite . for recent reviews ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite . using the usual definition of uncertainties , ( @xmath4 normalised ) ( x )",
    "_ = ( * x*- * x*)^2 ^ 1/2 [ ud ] the uncertainty relation eq.[ucr ] implies a small correction term to the commutation relation in the associative heisenberg algebra : = i(1 + * p*^2 + ... ) [ 1dcr ] for studies on the technical and conceptual implications of these and more general types of correction terms see @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we remark that those studies arose from work ( e.g. @xcite ) in the seemingly unrelated field of quantum groups , in which this type of commutation and uncertainty relations had appeared independently ( first in @xcite ) .",
    "a standard reference on quantum groups is @xcite . for the general case of @xmath5-dimensions",
    "it appears that no consensus has been reached in the literature on which generalisation of eq.[1dcr ] , i.e. which particular correction terms to the uncertainty relations could arise as a gravity effect in the ultraviolet , or as a string effect .",
    "let us therefore here consider small correction terms of a general form @xmath6 = i(_ij + _ ijkl * p*_k * p*_l+ ... ) [ one ] with the coefficients @xmath7 ( and also possible terms of higher power in the @xmath8 ) chosen such that the corresponding uncertainty relations imply a finite minimal uncertainty @xmath9 .",
    "we will for simplicity normally assume @xmath10 = 0 $ ] , but we allow @xmath11 \\ne 0 $ ]",
    ". we will generally refer to such modified commutation relations as describing a ` noncommutative geometry ' .",
    "let us keep in mind however that it is the correction terms to the @xmath12 commutation relations which induce @xmath9 .",
    "a noncommutativity of the @xmath13 will not be necessary for the appearance of a finite minimal uncertainty @xmath0 . in short , the key mechanism which leads to ultraviolet regularisation in the presence of a minimal uncertainty",
    "@xmath0 is the following : on ordinary geometry , i.e. with the ordinary commutation relations underlying , the states of maximal localisation are position eigenstates @xmath14 , for which the uncertainty in position vanishes .",
    "crucially , these maximal localisation states are nonnormalisable .",
    "therefore , their scalar product is not a function but the dirac @xmath15-distribution @xmath16 .",
    "as is well known , ( for a recent reference see @xcite ) , in the formulation of local interaction in field theory it is the ill - definedness of the product of these and related distributions which give rise to ultraviolet divergencies . a finite minimal uncertainty @xmath0 will yield normalisable maximal localisation states , and thereby regularise the ultraviolet .",
    "more precisely , as we will see , there exist geometries , i.e. generalised commutation relations of the type of eqs.[one ] such that there exists a minimal uncertainty @xmath9 , with the vectors of maximal localisation @xmath17 obeying : x^ml x^ml=1 , x_x^ml = x_0 , x^ml*x*x^ml= x x it follows that due to their normalisability , the scalar product ( x , y ) : = x^mly^ml[dt ] is a function rather than a distribution .",
    "a simple example is the one - dimensional case of eq.[1dcr ] with @xmath18 and no higher order corrections . for this case",
    "the scalar product of the maximal localisation states has been calculated in @xcite : ( x , y ) = ( - ( ) ^3 ) ^-1 ( ) [ deltabeta ] note that the poles of the first factor are cancelled by zeros of the sine function , so that @xmath19 is a regular function . for a graph see fig.3 in @xcite .",
    "the analogous result for the case with also a finite minimal uncertainty in momentum has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "we consider it to be an attractive feature of this short distance structure that it will not require the breaking of translation and rotation invariance , while also being compatible with possible ( e.g. quantum group- ) generalisations of these symmetries .",
    "also , this regularisation will not require to cut momentum space .",
    "a general approach for the formulation of quantum field theory on such geometries has been developed in @xcite , with a general result on infrared regularisation in @xcite , and preliminary results on ultraviolet regularisation in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to show the general mechanism , both abstractly and explicitly , by which a minimal uncertainty in position regularises the ultraviolet , i.e. we show how a @xmath0 could indeed provide a natural ultraviolet cutoff in quantum field theory . while we will focus here on commutation relations which induce a finite @xmath9 ,",
    "the general framework does allow for generic commutation relations .",
    "let us therefore also mention some of those studies which suggest such more general commutation relations .",
    "for example , the approach by doplicher et .",
    "@xcite suggests the existence of specific corrections to the @xmath20 commutation and uncertainty relations .",
    "one of the arguments there is that the improvement of a position measurement in one direction ultimately requires a delocalisation in orthogonal directions , in order to reduce the gravitationally disturbing energy density of the probing particle .",
    "a possible noncommutativity of the position operators was probably first discussed in @xcite , developing a line of thought which has been followed since , mainly by russian schools , see e.g.@xcite . in the context of noncommuting position operators ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "other studies , e.g. @xcite , suggest a length dependence of the minimal uncertainty in length measurements .",
    "correction terms specifically to the @xmath21 commutation relations have been discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the approach of ` generalised quantum dynamics ' by s. adler @xcite allows for generic commutation relations and a possible generalisation of the underlying hilbert space to a quaternionic or octonic space . in this approach",
    "the ordinary canonical commutation relations have been derived as a first order approximation in a statistical averaging process @xcite .",
    "further , it should also be of interest to apply the noncommutative geometric concepts developed in @xcite , in particular to study the modifications to the differential and integral calculus over such generalised quantum phase spaces .",
    "we note that , technically , the appearance of correction terms to the canonical commutation relations can generally also be viewed as a nontrivial and nonunique change of generators from the @xmath22 which obey @xmath23=i\\hbar$ ] to new sets of generators .",
    "examples for such algebra homomorphisms @xmath24 for the case of eq.[1dcr ] are for example @xmath25 , or also @xmath26 .",
    "the reason why a slight change in the commutation relations is able to introduce a drastically new short distance structure is not only that expectation values of a function of operators generally do not equal the function of the expectation values . technically , the reason is of course that algebra homomorphisms @xmath24 which change the commutation relations of the generators are necessarily noncanonical transformations , i.e. unlike symmetries , the @xmath24 can not be implemented as unitary ( nor as antilinear antiunitary ) transformations .",
    "unitaries @xmath27 generally preserve any chosen commutation relations , say @xmath28 , since @xmath29 .",
    "thus , any change in the commutation relations introduces new features into the theory , such as the appearance of a @xmath30 , which we will here focus on .",
    "let us consider the example of euclidean charged scalar @xmath31-theory , in its formulation on position space z[j ] : = n de^-d^4x [ ^ * ( -_i ^i + m^2 c^2 ) + ( ) ^*- ^*j - j^ * ] with @xmath32 a normalisation factor .",
    "fourier transformation allows to express the action functional in momentum space , which is of course to choose the plane waves as a hilbert basis in the space of fields which is formally being summed over .",
    "equivalently , the action functional can be expressed in any arbitrary other hilbert basis , such as e.g. a hilbert basis of hermite functions . in fact , it is not necessary to specify any choice of basis .",
    "fields can be identified as vectors in the representation space @xmath33 of the associative heisenberg algebra @xmath34 with the canonical commutation relations : [ * x*_i,*p*_j ] = i_ij i , j = 1, ... ,4 [ cr ] since the functional analytic structure is analogous to the situation in quantum mechanics , we formally extend the dirac notation for states to fields , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we recall that , via @xmath37 , the @xmath38 which appears in the fourier factor @xmath39 of the transformation from position to momentum space stems from the @xmath38 of eq.[cr ] .",
    "of course , the simple quantum mechanical interpretation of fields @xmath40 and in particular of the position and momentum operators of eq.[cr ] does not simply extend , due to the relativistically necessary existence of anti - particles , see @xcite .",
    "however , this formulation clarifies the functional analytic structure of the action functional @xcite : z[j ] = n de^ - * p*^2 + m^2 c^2- + j+ j [ dn ] the pointwise multiplication @xmath41 of fields is crucial for the description of local interaction .",
    "it maps two fields onto one field , i.e. @xmath42 and it normally reads : * = d^4x  xxx [ pmo ] so that , in our notation : @xmath43 on general geometries we read eq.[pmo ] with the @xmath14 denoting the vectors of maximal localisation i.e. we are integrating over the position expectation values of the maximal localisation vectors : * = d^4x   x^mlx^ml x^ml [ li ] in eq.[dn ] , in order to make the units more transparent , we introduced an arbitrary unit length @xmath44 , so that the fields @xmath40 become unitless .",
    "@xmath44 could trivially also be reabsorbed in the definition of the fields . as is easily seen , on ordinary geometry the vectors @xmath14 have units @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 has units @xmath45 , implying that the coupling constant @xmath47 ( of the unregularised theory ) is unitless . as is to be expected in a regularised situation , this changes on general geometries with normalisable maximal localisation vectors .",
    "due to @xmath48 the @xmath49 do not carry units , so that the coupling @xmath47 is no longer unitless .",
    "we recall that on ordinary geometry the position eigenvectors are the maximal localisation vectors , implying that the application of the definition eq.[pmo ] for @xmath41 in the partition function describes the maximally local interaction .",
    "the apparent ` nonlocality ' introduced in eq.[li ] is of the size of the minimal position uncertainty in the underlying geometry . within the framework , physical processes , including measurement processes , obey the uncertainty relations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the so - defined interactions are observationally strictly local since the apparent nonlocality could not be observed - due to the fuzzyness @xmath0 of the underlying geometry . in our formulation of field theories on noncommutative geometries",
    "we will stick to the abstract form of the action functional and the partition function , as e.g. given in eq.[dn ] , i.e. we will not introduce any changes `` by hand '' into the form of the action functional .",
    "the switching on of corrections to the underlying geometry will automatically manifest itself in the explicit form of the resulting feynman rules .",
    "the correction terms to the commutation relations induce modifications to the action of the operator @xmath50 , and to the properties of the maximally localised fields @xmath17 , which will both crucially enter into the feynman rules .",
    "we remark that , as a new feature , some generalised commutation relations will have nontrivial unitarily nonequivalent representations , as the well - known theorem by v. neumann no longer applies .",
    "it has been suggested that such cases could correspond to a noncommutative geometric analog of geometries with horizons or nontrivial topology @xcite .      for explicitness ,",
    "let us specify some arbitrary hilbert basis @xmath51 in the space @xmath33 of fields on which the generalised commutation relations are represented .",
    "while this basis can be continuous , discrete , or generally a mixture of both , we here use the convenient notation for @xmath5 discrete .",
    "we recall that the discreteness or continuousness of the choice of basis is unrelated to the issue of regularisation .",
    "@xmath33 is separable even in the case of the ordinary commutation relations , i.e. discrete hilbert bases ( such as the fock basis ) also exist on ordinary geometry .",
    "we remark that on ordinary geometry , and e.g. ` on position space ' , the situation is slightly subtle since the propagator and the vertex are then distributions .",
    "the situation will become simpler for @xmath52 , as the distributions will turn into regular functions .",
    "fields , operators and @xmath41 are expanded in the @xmath53 basis as _",
    "n = n ( * p*^2 + m^2c^2)_nm = n * p*^2 + m^2c^2 mand = _",

    "in the following we will illustrate the formalism with an explicit example of a noncommutative geometry .",
    "if we require our example geometry to obey translation and rotation invariance , there still appears to be considerable freedom in choosing the functions @xmath62 and , through eq.[tc ] , the function @xmath63 .",
    "many choices may not lead to geometries with a minimal uncertainty @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , eq.[tc ] indicates that @xmath63 can develop singularities .",
    "a detailed investigation into the various possibilities is in progress @xcite . here , in order to obtain a well behaved example geometry we simply force there not to appear a singularity by imposing , as the simplest choice @xmath64 : g = [ gde ] thus , eq.[tc ] then reads f^= which is solved by f = [ fde ] the taylor expansion around the origin is well behaved : f = 1 + p^2 + o((p^2)^2 ) so that , if we choose @xmath65 e.g. at around the planck scale @xmath66 then @xmath62 significantly deviates from the identity only for large momenta of that scale .",

    "we remark that concerning the possible choices of commutation relations it should generally be interesting to investigate the interplay of the technical constraints with the input and physical intuition from string theory and quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , as follows from the relation between the translators and the momenta , eq.[tau ] , the rule for the addition of extremely large momenta is modified through @xmath70 .",
    "there should exist an interpretation in terms of the effects of gravity at the planck scale , similar to the well known effect of momentum nonconservation through gravity on large scales @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 ) .",
    "this may e.g. be related to the old idea of possible curvature in momentum space , in which a generalised parallelogram rule for the addition of momenta has been discussed , see @xcite , and more recently @xcite .",
    "it has of course long been suggested that , more drastically , both rotation and translation invariance may be generalised or broken at the planck scale . any physical intuition for this could and",
    "should then also provide guidance for the generalisation of eq.[li ] to account for the then position ( and possibly orientation ) dependence of the short distance structure of the geometry .",
    "this will at first require a case by case study .",
    "the commutation relations eqs.[eg1],[eg2],[eg3 ] still find a hilbert space representation in the spectral representation of the momenta @xmath8 ( since momentum space is still commutative and there is no finite minimal uncertainty in momentum , @xmath73 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 . @xmath13 and",

    "the case of commutation relations with general @xmath78 is covered in @xcite .",
    "a further representation of the commutation relations eqs.[eg1],[eg2],[eg3 ] , which will prove convenient for practical calculations , is obtained by using that the translators @xmath79 are anti - hermitean and have a spectral representation on the hilbert basis @xmath80 of vectors obeying @xmath81 with i_n= \\ { ^n   ^2 < 2/ } i.e. the @xmath79 are bounded operators . the unitary transformation which maps from momentum space to the spectral representation of the @xmath79 has the matrix elements : p= ( 1-^2/2)^-(1+^2/2)^1/2   ^n ( p_i - ) [ pip ] the operator representations and the scalar product then read in @xmath82-space : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "before we do this in the next section , let us note an important representation theoretic consequence of the existence of a minimal uncertainty @xmath57 : a general argument shows that commutation relations which imply a finite minimal uncertainty in position can not find a hilbert space representation on a spectral representation of the the position operators : the uncertainty relations hold in all @xmath41-representations of the commutation relations .",
    "on the other hand , as is easily seen , e.g. in the example of eq.[ud ] , an eigenvector to an observable necessarily has vanishing uncertainty in this observable .",
    "thus , if the uncertainty relations imply a finite uncertainty in positions , they exclude the existence of any position eigenvectors in any physical domain , i.e. on any domain on which the commutation relations are represented . in particular , in cases where @xmath57 and @xmath86 both position and momentum representations are ruled out and one has to resort to other hilbert bases , as e.g. in @xcite . to be precise ,",
