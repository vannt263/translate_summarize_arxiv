    "* ) conclusive evidence on the true nature of many ulxs remains unclear .",
    "the ulx in holmberg ix ( ho  ix x-1 from now on ) is one such enigmatic source .",
    "the ulx , also known as holmberg  ix  x-1 or m81  x-9 , has been well studied in the x - rays and optical since its discovery by the einstein observatory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that the ulx is located at a distance of 3.6  mpc @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the most notable features of this ulx is the massive nebula in which it resides .",
    "stretching  300 pc @xmath5 400 pc in size , the nebula was first discovered and associated with the ulx by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the ultimate power source for the bubble nebula has been a matter of some debate .",
    "some explanations for its origin include 1 ) the combined strength of multiple o - stars and supernovae from the ob association in close proximity to the ulx , 2 ) a large hypernova event , or 3 ) winds and/or jets emanating from the ulx ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the suggestion that winds or jets might power the massive nebular bubble around ho  ix x-1 is in line with the theory that many ulxs are similar to the famous supercritically accreting x - ray binary in our own galaxy , ss  433 , rather than an imbh . indeed in the case of ho  ix x-1 , the other two scenarios have ostensibly been ruled out as plausible explanations for the nebula distribution .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the energy released by six supernovae in the vicinity of the ulx is not sufficient to reproduce the energy of the expanding nebular shell , ruling out ( 1 ) above .",
    "@xcite similarly find that the mechanical energy required to produce the nebula must result from a cluster that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the observed stellar association .",
    "they also suggest that the period of time needed for mass transfer to begin in ho  ix x-1 is far shorter than required for a hypernova event to explain the birth of the ulx , ruling out ( 2 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that winds and/or jets instead are more likely to power the bubble .",
    "* figure  10 ) support this finding , when they use shock models to describe the high excitation optical lines seen in ho  ix x-1 .",
    "finally , @xcite find radial velocity gradients that support the winds and/or jets explanation .",
    "many authors have noted the striking resemblance of ho  ix x-1 to ss 433 .",
    "for instance , @xcite note that the optical spectrum of ho  ix x-1 is similar to wind - dominated objects like ss 433 . in an x - ray study , @xcite",
    "see spectral variability patterns that are consistent with precession of the angle to the line - of - sight of the rotation axis of the ulx .",
    "this is very similar to what is seen in ss 433 as well .",
    "these scenarios hint that the processes powering emission in ho  ix x-1 and ss 433 may be similar , so much so that the two appear to be of the same family .",
    "if the ho  ix x-1 nebula is indeed powered by jets as is the case with its ss 433 ` cousin ' , direct evidence of these jets has yet to surface .",
    "however infrared photometry - an underused tool in the field of ulx astronomy - has the potential to produce a wealth of continuum information about the ulx that can be used to directly characterize the ulx sed .",
    "this has been done only once before for ulxs : in a study of holmberg  ii x-1 . in this study",
    "@xcite used spitzer mid - infrared data to constrain the ulx sed and found the data to be consistent with a broken power law typical of jet emission .",
    "the model was substantiated when @xcite used the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) to image the ulx and found signatures of jets emanating from the ulx . on the other hand",
    ", infrared photometry has been widely used in the x - ray binary community to uncover excess from irradiated disks , circumbinary disks , and dusty shells from companions stars @xcite .",
    "thus spitzer infrared photometry can be a powerful tool for uncovering structures and environments of ulxs , that optical and x - ray data can not .",
    "in this paper we present spitzer irac images of the ulx in holmberg ix . combining these images with multi - wavelength optical , uv , and x - ray data from the literature , we model the ho  ix x-1 sed to determine the source of the infrared emission in this ulx . in section 2",
    "we provide the details of the spitzer irac data analysis . in section 3",
    "we provide the fits to the full sed .",
    "in section 4 we discuss the origin of the infrared emission .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "for this analysis , we used two sets of archival spitzer infrared array camera ( irac ) data of the dwarf galaxy holmberg ix taken on november 15 , 2007 ( astronomical observation request , aors 22537472 and 22537728 ) .",
    "irac is a four - channel camera that provides 5.12 @xmath5 5.12 arcmin images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 microns .",
    "we processed the data both manually and using the post - processed basic calibration data ( pbcd ) available for download from the archive , but found no difference between the two methods .",
    "we used the spitzer mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) apex package to extract the photometric fluxes from the four channels .",
    "we followed the standard extraction procedure and conversion factors provided in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "the pipeline mosaics for irac are accurate to within 20% of the flux .",
    "all data calibration information , including background subtraction , are available in the footnoted links as well as in @xcite , which contains the exact point source extraction procedure from mopex . to ensure",
    "our ir data were extracted from the same region as the optical and x - ray data , we aligned the irac images with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) advance camera for surveys ( acs ) f555w / v image using 11 common sources in both ( hst acs observation i d go-9796 in table 1 ) .",
    "we find that the sources in the two images align to within 0.11 arcsec rms .",
    "table  1 provides fluxes extracted for the two sets of data and figure  1 shows false - color images of the ulx in 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 microns compared with a standard hst acs image of the ulx .",
    "we also used a subaru h@xmath6 image to overplot the contours of the bubble nebula .",
    "as the fluxes in table  1 show , the observations at 5.8 and 8.0 microns show a weak detection in one case ( aor 22537472 ) and an upper limit in another ( aor22537728 ) for a detection threshold of 4-sigma .",
    "indeed both observations are right on the line between detection and a non - detection for the 4-sigma threshold .",
    "because the two sets of observations are identical in exposure time and because they are contiguous ( i.e. one observation was taken right after the other ) , we chose to combine the two sets of observations to reduce the noise error on the measurements .",
    "the resultant fluxes are also provided in table  1 .",
    "the enhanced signal to noise in the combined measurement suggests a statistically significant detection at 5.8 and 8.0 microns that can be used to characterize the ir emission .",
    "to generate a full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ho  ix x-1 , we used optical , uv , and x - ray data from the literature @xcite .",
    "a summary of all archival data used for this analysis is presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the optical data comes primarily from hst and the reduction strategy for that data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the uv data primarily comes from optical monitor on board _ xmm - newton _ and the data analysis strategy for this data can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally the x - ray data comes from _ xmm - newton _ and the reduction strategy for these data can be found in @xcite .",
    "we used the extinction e(b - v ) = 0.26 adopted by @xcite to correct for absorption in the uv , optical and ir .",
    "the extinction curves used for this correction are taken from @xcite .",
    "this multi - wavelength data sample spans 5 years .",
    "we note that ho  ix x-1 is known to show x - ray variations of factors of 4 - 5 over days to years @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the only available multi - wavelength dataset that was taken of this object includes x - ray data from _ chandra _ that suffers from severe pile - up and is therefore unusable for the x - ray fitting portion of this analysis @xcite .",
    "however we were able to use this _ chandra _ data set to establish an estimate for the approximate x - ray flux during the same epoch as the hst data used here .",
    "indeed we find that the chandra flux is very close to the mean between the two sets of _ xmm _ x - ray observations .",
    "therefore , in the following , note that the actual hst - epoch x - ray flux is likely somewhere between the two _ xmm _ x - ray data sets and that the plotted data set provided here is _ not _ simultaneous .",
    "as the following sections will demonstrate , the multi - epoch nature of these data makes generating a good fit difficult .",
    "x - ray spectra exist in the archives from _ xmm - newton _",
    ", _ swift _ , and _",
    "nustar_. @xcite found two main types of spectra : one hard ultra - luminous ( hul)-like and one more disk - like ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we selected the _ xmm - newton _ datasets 0112521101 and 0693851701 ( refered to as obs 1 and obs 2 respectively from here forward ) , which represent each of the two , typical ulx spectra regimes seen in this object .",
    "we used xspec version 12.7.1 to model the two x - ray spectra of ho  ix x-1 between 0.3 and 10 kev .",
    "the x - ray data were provided by and processed per the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data were fit with three models : multi - color disk ( mcd ) + comptonization model ( comptt ) , self - irradiated funnel model ( sirf ) , and an irradiated disk model ( diskir ) .",
    "note that the former two were fit to the x - ray data only , while the latter ( diskir ) was fit to both the x - ray and optical data since that made the most physical sense for this model as described in the following .",
    "we start with a model typically used to fit ulxs , with an accretion disk component ( mcd in xspec ) and the comptt model to account for the comptonization in a disk - corona geometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we obtain good fits for both spectra .",
    "the parameter fit results are shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the self - irradiated funnel model ( sirf in xspec ) , describes the emission from a `` supercritical funnel '' , similar to ss  433 @xcite .",
    "the sirf model provides acceptable fits for both sets of x - ray spectra .",
    "the accretion rate was fixed at 350 @xmath5 eddington , the funnel opening angle was set to 30 degrees and the inclination angle was set to zero .",
    "the inner radius for this model is calculated in units of the `` spherisation radius '' @xcite . in order to better compare them with the other models we convert them in units of km using the luminosity .",
    "we obtained estimates for the bolometric luminosities from the fitted x - ray models plus the jet model fit to the irac data ( see section 4 ) .",
    "then we used the accretion rate to estimate black hole masses of 41  m@xmath4 and 107  m@xmath4 for the first and the second observation , respectively .",
    "the spherization radius can then be calculated @xcite for each black hole mass .",
    "finally we convert the fitted radii in the sirf model to km .",
    "these are listed in column 5 in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the diskir model is particularly useful when optical and uv data are available in addition to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this is because many ulxs detected in the optical / uv show seds well fit by an irradiated disk @xcite .",
    "in this case it makes sense to fit the x - ray data together with the optical data , since the irradiation portion describes a large fraction of the optical / uv emission .",
    "indeed an irradiated disk was found to have an important contribution in the optical in other ulxs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following gierlinski et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) and berghea & dudik ( 2012 ) we set the fraction of the flux thermalized in the inner disk at 0.1 and the radius of the compton irradiated disk at 1.1 of the inner disk radius .",
    "a good fit requires we set a large comptonized luminosity ( @xmath7 unilluminated disk luminosity ) , and an outer disk of radius 1000 r@xmath8 ( where r@xmath8 is the inner disk radius ) , but this parameter is not well constrained .",
    "the fits are not acceptable statistically , but we obtained estimates for the irradiated flux fraction .",
    "it is large for both x - ray obs 2 ( hul - like , @xmath16.8% ) , and x - ray obs 1 ( disk - like , @xmath15.7% ) .",
    "typical values of 2 - 4% have been found for previous fits of ulx x - ray / optical datasets with the diskir model @xcite .",
    "@xcite used an improved model for irratiated disks ( one that accounts for the color - temperature correction ) to fit a sample of ulxs with disk - like spectra . in this study , @xcite compared the new diskir model results with a more traditional diskir model fit .",
    "they found that for most objects the reprocessing fraction is ten times lower than predicted by traditional diskir models that do not include the color - temperature corrections , and that these new reprocessing fractions are closer to what is observed in galactic binaries .",
    "however for one of the brighter objects in that sample ( ngc1313 x-2 ) they found a similar reprocessing fraction to ulxs where the spectrum may be more hul - like .",
    "they interpreted the higher reprocessing fraction in the brighter ulx as originating in a higher scattering fraction onto the outer disk from the extensive wind thought to be driven off the disk ; the high reprocessing fraction in ho ix x-1 is consistent with this interpretation .      in the following",
    "we construct the sed by extending the x - ray models we fit in the previous section to the optical / uv and ir data .",
    "* extrapolated sirf model : * the extrapolated sirf models are plotted in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "neither of these x - ray models fit the optical data well , however the optical data is located between the two sirf models . when the x - ray spectrum is disk - like , it over - predicts the optical data by a factor of 6.2 . when the x - ray spectrum is hul - like it under - predicts the optical data by a factor of 3.2 .",
    "taking into account the variability of the ho  ix x-1 and the multi - epoch nature of this data set we conclude that a funnel model is capable of reproducing the optical and x - ray data",
    ". however figure  [ sed ] clearly shows that the sirf model does not fit any of the ir data . indeed",
    "if this sirf model were the appropriate model for the optical and x - ray data , an additional component would be needed to explain the ir excess .",
    "* extrapolated disk models : * as expected , simple disk models without irradiation are too faint in the optical .",
    "our mcd+comptt models shown in figure  [ sed ] are more than an order of magnitude lower than the hubble data if they are extrapolated into the optical .",
    "following @xcite we added a b0  ib star to fit the optical photometry ( black line in figure  [ sed ] ) in this case , which resulted in a good fit to the data from x - ray to optical .",
    "the optical data are fit so well by the stellar model , that an ir excess is clearly present at wavelengths longer than the h - band measurement .",
    "thus an additional component is needed to explain the irac data for the extrapolated disk model as well .",
    "* diskir model : * per section 3.1 we began fitting the diskir data to the optical + x - ray data since it makes physical sense to do so when optical data is available .",
    "this extrapolated diskir model , described in section 3.1 , was a very good fit to the optical data but unfortunately not statistically acceptable overall for either x - ray data set . here too , the diskir model is also not a good fit the irac data .    based on these fits and the multi - epoch nature of this dataset , we conclude that all three models are plausible models for the optical / uv / x - ray data in ho  ix x-1 . to definitively rule out",
    "any one model would require good , simultaneous optical and x - ray data ( gris et al .",
    "2016 , in prep ) .",
    "however , most importantly , none of these models fit the ir excess we see in ho  ix x-1 , suggesting another mechanism is responsible for this emission .",
    "as figure  [ sed ] shows , there is a clear ir excess in ho  ix x-1 that can not be explained by the optical or x - ray models .",
    "the ir excess could be due to contamination from other stars within the 2 arcsecond extraction region , however based on the b0  ib stellar model in figure 2 ( which is also the brightest star in the 2 arcsecond extraction circle ) , we expect the contribution from all stars in that field to be negligible in the ir since their collective seds drop sharply at ir wavelengths .",
    "there are four possible sources for the ir excess : 1 ) the irradiated disk / the companion star , 2 ) a heated dust shell , 3 ) a circumbinary disk such as those seen in x - ray binaries , or 4 ) a jet . because none of the models from the previous sections produce sufficient emission in the ir to replicate our irac data , the latter three options are the only plausible emission mechanisms .",
    "we note that some fraction of the ir emission will also result from contamination from the bubble nebula .",
    "@xcite found some red excess in the i - band based on the stellar model fits to the hst data .",
    "however the hst images from this study suggest the i - band emission is not coming from nebular contamination , especially in the central location @xcite .",
    "in addition the h - band fits the stellar continuum very well and does not show a similar excess .",
    "we explore the three remaining options for the excess below .",
    "* heated dust shell : * emission from a heated dust shell is one explanation for the ir excess seen in ho  ix x-1 .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a dust component with temperature @xmath9400  k from the galactic x - ray binary grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "grs1915 + 105 is a microquasar that has a red giant as a donor @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that the dust component could be related to the dusty shell often found surrounding red giants .",
    "we fit a spherical blackbody model to the ho  ix x-1 irac data .",
    "this blackbody , shown in figure  [ sed ] , gives a dust temperature of @xmath9 1100  k and a radius of @xmath9 1400  r@xmath4 .",
    "however , the fit is quite poor , the @xmath10 being much greater than two , thereby precluding error estimates for the parameters .",
    "the dust temperature is normal for dusty shells around red giants , however if the companion star is a blue supergiant , as the optical hst data suggests , it is unlikely to be surrounded by dust .",
    "in addition this blackbody emission does not fit the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath11 m data well .",
    "we therefore rule out this option as a viable model for the infrared emission in the ulx .",
    "* circumbinary disk : * an alternative explanation for a dust component is the circumbinary disk proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to explain the ir emission in x - ray binaries ( ss  433 , grs1915 + 105 , a0620 - 00 and xte j1118 + 480 ) . here",
    "the circumbinary disk is distinct from the accretion disk described in section 3 , and is composed of material that may have been lost through the l2 point ( e.g. ss433 , see * ? ? ?",
    "if ho  ix x-1 is more like these x - ray binaries , we might expect to see such a circumbinary disk in the infrared . in this case",
    "the black body model that we fit to the infrared data would represent emission from the inner circumbinary disk , while the redder 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath11 m excess is likely emanating from the outer portion of the circumbinary disk as lower temperature blackbody emission .",
    "the four irac data points that comprise the ir excess in ho  ix x-1 are not sufficient to fit a complicated circumbinary disk model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however in its simplest form , the circumbinary disk model is very similar to an irradiated disk model , only the source of illumination in the former case is the accretion disk and the star .",
    "we therefore fit a very simple p - free disk model to the four irac points .",
    "as can be seen from figure 2 , the data are consistent with this simple p - free disk ( @xmath12 ) , but the disk vastly over - predicts the h - band flux and the temperature for the fit is unconstrained ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we conclude that if a circumbinary disk is responsible for the irac emission in this object then the optical and/or ir emission must be variable .",
    "* jet emission : * in the jet emission scenario we expect a broken power law with a break in the ir and we attempted to fit the combined irac and hst data with such a model .",
    "extinction e(b - v ) was fixed at 0.26 and the break energy at 0.35  ev ( approximately at the 3.6 @xmath11 m irac band , see figure  [ sed ] ) . for comparison",
    "the break is at 0.12  ev for cygnus x-1 and 0.48 for gx  339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "inspection of the fit clearly indicates that the hst h - band flux is prohibitively low for a reasonable power law model .",
    "the emission in h - band fits the stellar model so well that any additional contribution from a jet - dominated power law would either severely over predict the observed emission or suggest a power law slope that is unrealistically steep @xcite .",
    "indeed the spectral index of the fit in figure  [ sed ] is @xmath14 in the optical / ir compared with typical indices of @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we conclude from this that either a ) the ir emission from ho  ix x-1 is _ not _ jet - dominated or b ) that the radio ejecta are transient as is thought to be the case with ho  ii x-1 @xcite . the multi - epoch nature of the hst and ir data results in a degeneracy in the models that can only be broken by a series of radio monitoring activities designed to detect the jet emission when it is in its most luminous state .    based on the analysis presented in the previous sections",
    ", the ir emission in ho  ix x-1 suggests that the system contains a circumbinary disk much like those detected in x - ray binaries ( e.g ss  433 , grs1915 + 105 , a0620 - 00 and xte j1118 + 480 ) or emission from a variable jet such as that seen with ho  ii x-1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the transient jet scenario ,",
    "simultaneous ir and optical data might uncover a more reasonable power - law slope and h - band emission that is significantly higher than observed in the data set presented here .",
    "we also find that the ir data is not well fit by a single black body , such as that expected from a dusty shell .",
    "however , in this case the simultaneity of the data will not significantly improve the fit , since the single black body fits neither the optical data nor the longer wavelength ir data as well .",
    "the degeneracy between the circumbinary disk and transient jet theory underscores the need for simultaneous observations when observing ulx structure and environments . in this case ,",
    "very sensitive radio observations of ho  ix x-1 may solidify these findings and help detect or constrain the power law break and slope needed to confirm jet activity . indeed such radio observations have recently been obtained using the jvla b - array and will be published in a follow - on study to this paper .",
    "however , as this study also indicates , deep radio _ monitoring _ observations with jvla are also critical to providing information about the ir excess in this source in the event that the jet ( if one exists ) is variable .",
    "using _ spitzer _ irac observations of ho  ix x-1 , we have constructed an sed of the ulx .",
    "two contiguous irac observations of ho  ix x-1 were made .",
    "the datasets at 5.8 and 8.0 microns are at the sensitivity limit of the irac instrument , however combining these measurements yields a statistically significant detection in both bands .",
    "the combined measurements coupled with detailed fits to previous optical / uv and x - ray data of ho  ix x-1 suggest that the ir excess in this object is due either to a circumbinary disk such as those seen in ss  433 and other standard x - ray binaries or a variable jet such as that seen in ho  ii x-1 by @xcite .",
    "future high - sensitivity radio monitoring observations would be needed to break the degeneracy between the two models and determine if the ir excess seen in ho  ix x-1 results from either mechanism .",
