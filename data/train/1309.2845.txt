    "in biological systems , a large number of elements , such as cells and organs , interact with each other and adapt system - wide behavior spontaneously in response to changes of environment and of physical constraints .",
    "such spontaneous and adaptive dynamics have been studied in the framework of collective dynamics @xcite . to clarify the mechanism of adaptability , however , we need to investigate how the dynamics of interactions between elements should depend on the global behavior to establish adaptability .",
    "collective dynamics has been studied as a distributed system to investigate how global structures emerge from the interaction of elements .",
    "many types of distributed systems have been modeled by using differential equations , and the system behaviors have been described by appropriate basin switching between attractors @xcite .",
    "for instance , previous studies investigated retrieval of a specific pattern by neural oscillator networks @xcite . in these studies , the stable pattern was predicted by lyapunov function analysis , and the basin switching was accomplished by controlling the potential profiles .",
    "complex dynamics observed in brain systems have been studied in terms of chaotic itinerancy .",
    "transient behavior between ordered and disordered states has been shown in some coupled oscillator systems . @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to propose a distributed system showing appropriate basin switching by using the pathfinding problem .",
    "pathfinding strategies have been proposed in both theoretical and experimental contexts . in laboratory experiments , pathfinding algorithms based on self - organization processes have been studied @xcite . in @xcite , a continuous model for the experimental results of @xcite has been proposed . in their model",
    ", a conservation mass has been assumed , which allows the system to find the shortest path @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we modify the loop searching system proposed in @xcite to apply it to the pathfinding problem in the framework of a distributed system ; that is , no conservation mass is assumed .",
    "the path connecting the start and goal points is represented by a loop path containing both the start point and the goal point .",
    "in such a network structure , a pathfinding problem can be regarded as a loop finding problem .",
    "therefore , we propose a two - layer network system to construct such loop networks . in addition , in order to improve the finding time of the desired path , the effects of interactions between the dynamics of the two layers are considered .",
    "the presented system shows the following three properties .",
    "( i ) the system spontaneously finds a path connecting the start and goal nodes if such a path exists .",
    "( ii ) the system shows the self - recovery property , that is , the system finds another possible path when the existing path is broken due to the removal of paths .",
    "( iii ) in a tree structure network , the finding time increases in proportion to the depth of the tree .",
    "the graphs we consider in this study have unidirectional edges between vertices and are acyclic .",
    "the graph has two special vertices referred to as the start vertex and the goal vertex . in this section ,",
    "we propose a construction procedure for a system that shows properties ( i ) to ( iii ) .",
    "the path is defined by a stable solution of the system . to avoid confusion",
    ", we use the terms , _ vertex _ and _ edge _ for the given graph and _ node _ and _ link _ for the same properties of the system .",
    "the assumptions for the system are given as follows .",
    "* we assume two layers exist , and a pair of nodes is placed on the layers at every vertex position ( fig.[fig : bilayer ] ) . for notational convenience , we refer to one of the layers as the p - layer ( positive ) and to the other one as the n - layer ( negative ) .",
    "the node numbers corresponding to the @xmath0th vertex in the p - layer and in the n - layer are given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "* the excitatory links in the p - layer and the n - layer take place along the forward and backward direction of the edges , respectively .",
    "that is , if the network of the p - layer has an excitatory link from node @xmath3 to node @xmath1 , then the network of the n - layer has an excitatory link from node @xmath2 to node @xmath4 .",
    "bidirectional inhibitory links take place at every branching point of excitatory links .",
    "additional assumptions for the inhibitory interactions are given in ( s7 ) and ( s7 ) .",
    "* each node contains a large number of oscillators , and the state of each node is determined by the dynamics of the group oscillators corresponding to the node . * each p - layer and n - layer has two special nodes , corresponding to the start vertex and the goal vertex , referred to as the start node and the goal node , respectively .",
    "the start nodes of the p - layer and the n - layer are labeled @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the goal nodes of the p - layer and the n - layer are labeled @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the network has an excitatory link from @xmath6 to @xmath5 and from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . * the network in the p - layer and the n - layer without the two links placed at the start and goal nodes is acyclic .",
    "if a connecting path from the start vertex to the goal vertex exists , then a connecting path from the start node to the goal node exists in the p - layer and a connecting path from the goal node to the start node exists in the n - layer from ( s2 ) .",
    "therefore , from ( s5 ) , loops of excitatory links are formed ; these loops contain nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "we assume that the interaction function @xmath30 has a threshold for activation ; thus , the state of the connection switches dynamically between the on and off states depending on the state of the node . the regulation of the on - off switching of the connecting nodes depends on @xmath31 and is defined by the heaviside function with a threshold @xmath32 , where @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "in this section , we confirm that the presented system shows the properties ( i)-(iii ) listed in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "a path is defined as a chain of lso states belonging to the corresponding nodes in both the p - layer and the n - layer .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the presented system tends to choose shorter paths when multiple paths exist .",

    "initially , we take the start and goal vertices as vertices 1 and 6 , respectively ; that is , @xmath85 and @xmath86 [ fig.[fig : perturb](a ) ] . at @xmath87 ,",
    "the network has three possible paths connecting the start and goal vertices : path @xmath88 , path @xmath89 , and path @xmath90 . in numerical results shown in [ fig.[fig : perturb](a ) ] , path @xmath90 is selected from the possible paths .    to confirm the self - recovery property , edge 8@xmath779 of the existing edge",
    "is removed at @xmath91 [ fig.[fig : perturb](b ) ] ; the parameter values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are changed from @xmath94 to @xmath95 at @xmath91 .",
    "then , it is observed that the system can find a new path @xmath96 .",
    "the system can find a new path when the positions of the start and goal vertices are changed .",
    "for example , in fig.[fig : perturb](c)(d ) , it is observed that the system finds a path when the position of the goal vertex is changed from 6 to 11 at @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and from @xmath99 to @xmath100 at @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . due to the addition of the excitatory links at @xmath101",
    ", inhibitory links are added between @xmath103 and @xmath104 from ( s2 ) and ( s7 ) .",
    "when the network has no connecting paths , all of the node states become inc from the regulatory rules .      in order to estimate the increase in the rate of finding as the node number increases , we use a hierarchical tree network , shown in fig.[fig : tree ] : @xmath105 ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , where @xmath108 is the depth of the hierarchy .",
    "the start position is fixed at vertex 1 , and the goal vertex is changed between the leftmost vertex ( vertex @xmath109 ) and the rightmost vertex ( vertex @xmath110 ) at the bottom of the tree when the system has succeeded in finding a desired path .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath111 ( fig.[fig : tree ] ) , the path contains vertices 1 , 2 , and 4 when the goal vertex is 4 and vertices 1 , 3 , and 7 when the goal vertex is 7 . the average finding time is calculated across 50 trials",
    "now we compare the finding time for the presented system [ ( s7 ) ] with @xmath112 and the previous system [ ( s7 ) ] and @xmath108 are taken as control parameters . in the case of the previous system ,",
    "the finding time increases substantially as @xmath108 increases [ fig.[fig : tree ] ( b ) ] .",
    "in contrast , the finding time increases at an almost constant rate for the presented system .",
    "next , we investigate the dependence of @xmath16 on the finding time .",
    "it is observed that the finding time is improved and the distributions tend to be narrow when @xmath16 is increased for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig : tree ] ( d ) shows the distributions of the finding time when @xmath16 is taken as a control parameter with @xmath115 .",
    "we note that the distributions tend to be wide again for @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that the large @xmath16 basically decreases the finding time ; however , a large @xmath16 also decreases the reliability when the vertex number increases .",
    "the difference of the finding time between the two systems comes from the timing of the activation of the inhibitory interaction .",
    "the inhibitory interactions play a role in path selection at the branching point of excitatory links . in the presented system ,",
    "the activation of the inhibitory interaction at node @xmath23 is regulated by both @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the inhibitory interaction for a large @xmath16 becomes active ( i.e. , path selection initiates ) after an lso wave propagates to , at least , either the start node or the goal node . in the example network in fig.[fig : hikaku ] ( a ) , the path selection initiates after the system succeeds in finding a desired path .",
    "this prevents the system from selecting wrong paths , and thus results in a decrease in finding time .",
    "in contrast , for the previous system , since the inhibitory interactions activate when either @xmath117 or @xmath118 is larger than @xmath32 , the selection of a path at branching points occurs before the system has found both the start and goal vertices , as shown in the example network in fig.[fig : hikaku ] ( b ) .     and of the previous system ( dashed line ) .",
    "( c ) magnified figure of ( b ) .",
    "( d ) the distribution of finding time of the presented system with @xmath115 and @xmath119 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]          as discussed in section [ sec : time ] , for the presented system , the inhibitory interactions become active when an lso wave , which has already passed through either the start node or the goal node , first reaches the branching point .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the system chooses a path for which the distance between the branching point and the start or goal node is the shortest ; this is , the node distance between the branching point and the start ( or goal ) node is smallest .",
    "the ratio of the chosen path to the shortest path is calculated for a network shown in fig.[fig : shortest ] , where the distance of the path is defined by the number of nodes in the path .",
    "the difference of the node number @xmath120 is taken as a control parameter .",
    "as initial data , the state of the start node is set to lso and the other nodes are set to inc .",
    "the number of trials is 100 with different random seeds .",
    "it is confirmed that the presented system with @xmath112 and @xmath121 selects shorter paths more frequently as @xmath120 increases .",
    ", respectively .",
    "( b ) network structures .",
    "we fix @xmath121 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in this study , by building on a previous system @xcite , we have presented a pathfinding system .",
    "the finding process uses only local interaction between nodes ; that is , the presented system is in a class of distributed systems .",
    "the system inherits the self - recovery property from the previous system .",
    "in fact , we have demonstrated that the system can find a new path when perturbation of the existing paths occurs .",
    "we further modify the inhibitory interactions to improve the finding time of the desired path .",
    "it has been numerically confirmed that the finding time increases linearly as the depth of the hierarchy of the tree - like network increases .",
    "the self - recovery process is explained by using a network shown in fig.[fig : recover ] .",
    "for example , if the goal vertex is changed from @xmath122 to @xmath100 [ fig.[fig : recover](a ) ] , the state of nodes @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 successively becomes inc due to ( c1 ) , and the state of node @xmath126 is changed from sso to lso due to ( c3 ) [ fig.[fig : recover](b ) ] . due to ( c1 ) , the state of nodes @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath125 , and @xmath129 successively becomes lso , and the desired path is found [ fig.[fig : recover](c)(d ) ] .",
    "it should be noted that the lso state of node @xmath130 needs to be maintained during the process ( c ) to ( d ) .",
    "this means that the transient time from lso to inc should be chosen to be large enough compared to the lso wave speed and network size by taking @xmath27 near the limit point in fig.[fig : bif ] .",
    "if the graph contains a cyclic loop that does not contain the start vertex or the goal vertex , the system may fail to find the connecting path between the start and goal nodes , since an lso loop along the cyclic loop is stable , and the system may choose it .",
    "thus , we assumed ( s6 ) .",
