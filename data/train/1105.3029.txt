    "a study of interactions of relativistic nuclei is related to a search for unusual nuclear matter conditions ( as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , for example ) , which can be observed at high energies @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of simple features of these processes , such as total cross sections , multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions , etc .",
    "is rather precisely described by various models , even if they are based on the various assumptions about nuclear structure and dynamics of nuclear interactions .",
    "more detailed information , critical to a choice between existing models , can be deduced by investigating a fluctuation structure of secondary particle distributions .",
    "recent studies of pseudorapidity distributions have shown that some considerable deviations from average distribution can be observed in individual events .",
    "certainly , these deviations can be initiated by the statistical factors , connected with finite number of particles in the given event .",
    "if the statistical explanation can not describe these fluctuations , there are the some dynamic mechanisms , which could produce peculiarities of pseudorapidity distributions .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have proposed a normalized range method for analysing pseudorapidity correlations in multiparticle production processes .",
    "this method allows not only to discriminate dynamic correlations from statistical ones , but also to determine a `` force '' and `` length '' of these correlations .    in the present paper",
    "we apply this method to the analysis of experimental pseudorapidity distributions of secondary particles obtained in 10.7 a gev @xmath3 and 200 a gev @xmath4 interactions with emulsion nuclei .",
    "as result of high - energy interaction of two nuclei plenty of secondary particles is produced . according to the existing notions , secondary particles , which are `` emited '' from `` interaction volume '' , have pseudorapidities , corresponding to a central region of pseudorapidity distribution . at borders of the distribution fragments ( of the target - nucleus and projectile - nucleus )",
    "bring in considerable contribution . and so , in order to investigate of pseudorapidity correlations in distribution of particles from `` interaction volume '' we have chosen pseudorapidity interval @xmath5 ( for the @xmath4 , 200 a gev , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and for the @xmath8 , 10.7 a gev , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "this interval has been subdivided into @xmath11 parts with @xmath12 . by counting the number of particles in each subinterval we arrive at a sequence @xmath13 .",
    "a pseudorapidity fluctuation , or the normalized relative deviation of an individual event from average pseudorapidity distribution ] is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of particles in the i - th bin of an event with particles number @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the total number of particles for all events in the i - th bin , and @xmath18 is the total number of particles for all events .    for analysis we have selected events with the number of secondary particles ( except fragments ) greater than 90 , because high statistics are necessary for a study of correlations by our method .    as described in our previous work @xcite for an investigation of pseudorapidity correlations we analysed the normalized range @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are a `` range '' and a standard deviation , which is calculated by eqs.([s])-([1 ] ) , see below ) versus the size of the pseudorapidity interval @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 ) using a function @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two free parameters and @xmath26 is the correlation index ( or hurst index ) . if the signal @xmath27 represents white noise ( a completely uncorrelated signal ) , then @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 , long - range correlations are in a system @xcite .    in our calculations",
    "we have used @xmath30 .",
    "the choice of such large value of @xmath11 is not necessary ( it is possible using lesser @xmath11 also ) .",
    "but the more @xmath11 the more accuracy of method is approachable .",
    "so , for the sequence @xmath27 , @xmath31 , quantities of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were calculated by following formulas : @xmath34 ^ 2\\right]^{1/2 } \\label{s}\\ ] ] @xmath35 where the quantity @xmath36 characterizes the accumulated deviation from the average @xmath37 for a certain interval @xmath38 , @xmath39 , \\quad 1\\le i \\le m \\le k \\label{1}\\ ] ]    then the sequence @xmath40 has been subdivided into two parts : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the value of @xmath45 was found for each of the two independent series .",
    "similarly @xmath41 and @xmath43 have been subdivided further , followed by the calculation of @xmath46 .",
    "this subdivision and analysis procedure for newly obtained series of @xmath27-values is continued until @xmath47 . @xmath48 corresponding to the same value of @xmath49 have been averaged and drawn on a log - log scale as a function of @xmath49  ( fig.1 ) .     the correlation curve for ( au+em)-interactions at 10.7 a gev .",

    "those three points were : the first has been subsequently conferred by obtained hurst index and other two ones are neighboring points .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath26 corresponding to @xmath51 @xmath52 in the fig.1 has been found , using ( [ 6 ] ) and with following a fitting procedure for points @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath51 @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath57 from the fig.1 .",

    "it is possible that there are several probable reasons for the existence of such large correlations in multiparticle production processes .",
    "but , nevertheless , at present we know only one way when similar behaviour ( to experimental one ) of the correlation curve can be obtained . as result of interactions of two particles at high energy there",
    "is formed some large claster ( or several clasters ) , which then disintegrates into a plenty of secondary particles in the interval of @xmath103 .",
    "this process was simulated with the help of the programme `` hrndm '' , included into the software package of `` hbook '' @xcite .",

    "it is seen that the more dimension of the compound system , the more `` kink '' of the correlation curve will be displayed .",
    "moreover , such the large kink of correlation curve , which observed for experimental events , can not be explaned by two - particle disintegrations .",
    "so , the curve with j=50 and p=0.02 in fig.7right corresponds to process with maximal two - particle correlations ( all secondary particles are produced as result of two - particles disintegrations ) . in this case",
    "the correlation index reached only 0.62 . in order to obtain the values @xmath26 which observed for experimental data , it is necessary to assume that the compaund system , which produces @xmath115 % ( for au+em ) and @xmath116% ( for s+em ) of secondary particles , is formed .",
    "it should be noted that for search of the most interesting effects as quark - gluon plasma , for example , in cern experiments as na44 , na49 , wa98 etc .",
    "symmetric collisions of heavy ion as pb+pb ( or au+au ) are used .",
    "if our results will be confirmed by other experimental data ( for instance , in interactions of @xmath102 ( or @xmath117 ) and nuclei of @xmath85 group at other ( more or less than 10.7 a gev ) energies ) then it will be possible declare that probability of exhibition of qgp in asymmetric interaction is more than that in symmetric ones .",
    "to clear this point it is possible by primitive model . supposing that a nucleon is an elastic ball , inside which quarks are disposed , and nucleus is some system consisting the balls , which are glued together . at the moment of collision first balls , coming into contact ,",
    "are squeezed by other balls , which push them from behind and in front . and",
    "so , a real energy of interaction ( at this `` region '' ) is significantly more than an energy per nucleon ( some cumulative effect ) . a pressure ( at this `` region '' )",
    "is enormous .",
    "volumes of the `` interacting balls '' is getting significantly diminished ( is squeezed ) . as result",
    "a nucleon `` envelope '' can burst and quarks ( from the nucleon ) will be in quasifree state inside dense `` encirclement '' of squeezed ( but not bursting ) neighbouring nucleons .",
    "this region can exist and be expanded till large nucleus are not split ( when `` force of glue '' will be less than `` breaking force of the wedged ( smaller ) nucleus '' ) .",
    "if an interaction is less central ( almost peripheral ) one , then quarks region and time of its existence will be less , because of that the probability to chop off smaller `` scrap '' is more than that to split nucleus to `` fifty - fifty '' . in case of collision of symmetric nuclei",
    "the quarks region can appear also , but its dimensions will be still less , because dense `` encirclement '' , which is capable to retain ( inside itself ) quarks , is absent ( it is similar to peripheral interaction of asymmetric nuclei ) .",
    "the analysis of pseudorapidity correlations in 10.7 a gev @xmath0 and 200 a gev @xmath1 interactions with emulsion nuclei has been carried out by the normalized range method . this analysis has revealed events with large multiparticle correlations ( with large kink of correlation curve ) .",
    "we assume that the main cause of this behaviour of the correlation curve is a formation of large compound system , which then disintegrates into a large number of secondary particles in the interval of @xmath118 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the most significant pseudorapidity correlations are observed in the central interactions of nuclei , which have considerable difference in volume ( in nuclear weight , charge , etc . ) at rather `` low '' energies ( the nuclei of au and cno group at 10.7 a gev ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether a similar effect is observed in interactions of other nuclei ( for example , lead and nuclei of cno group ) and whether it depends on the interaction energy ( if the effect will be increase at energy of collision more than 10.7 a gev ) .",
