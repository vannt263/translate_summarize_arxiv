    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments such as the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) have made significant progress in the study of the primordial temperature fluctuations .",
    "their best fitting power spectra strongly support a spatially flat , @xmath4 , universe .",
    "this model requires relatively few parameters , yet apparently manages a compelling concordance between a variety of other cosmological data ; snia , large scale structure and big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "although the statistical errors on these power spectra are small , this precision does not necessarily imply accuracy and there remains the potential for systematic errors to alter these conclusions .",
    "indeed , several anomalies between @xmath4 and the _ wmap _ data have been discussed .",
    "typically these have involved the large - scale temperature multipoles eg : @xcite . however ,",
    "other anomalies in the cmb at smaller scales have also been detected , connected in particular with radio sources @xcite and sz decrements from galaxy clusters @xcite    radio sources are sometimes regarded as a contaminant in cmb temperature maps . however , radio point sources prove particularly interesting because they provide a complementary check of the beam measured by the _ wmap _",
    "team from observations of jupiter @xcite .",
    "jupiter has a flux of @xmath5 1200jy which is @xmath6 orders of magnitude higher than radio source fluxes or cmb fluctuations .",
    "this high flux has advantages in terms of defining the wings of the beam profile but has the disadvantage that the calibrating source is much brighter than typical cmb fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , jupiter only checks the beam on the ecliptic whereas radio sources are spread over the sky . @xcite",
    "made a stacked analysis of radio point sources and found evidence for a wider beam than _ wmap _ measured using jupiter .",
    "a tentative detection of a non - linear relation between _ wmap _ fluxes and ground based radio telescope fluxes was also found .",
    "a thorough analysis of possible systematics did not find an explanation and we return to these issues later in this paper .",
    "the beam profile of a cmb telescope like _ wmap _ is critical because it smoothes the temperature anisotropies and therefore needs to be known accurately to produce the final power spectrum from temperature maps @xcite .",
    "various authors have noted small - scale anomalies with respect to the sz decrements measured by _",
    "sz decrements are created when cmb photons inverse compton scatter off hot electrons in galaxy clusters . @xcite",
    "first stacked _",
    "wmap _ data at the positions of galaxy clusters and suggested that the profiles were more extended than expected . @xcite and",
    "@xcite then found that the sz decrements from _ wmap _ were reduced compared to x - ray predictions , possibly due to the _ wmap _ beam being wider than expected .",
    "@xcite also found that the _ wmap _ decrements were significantly lower than the ground - based sz measurements by @xcite in 38 x - ray luminous clusters .    in their esz sample ,",
    "the _ planck _",
    "team find excellent agreement with the self - similar x - ray estimates of the sz decrement @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by the ground based south pole telescope collaboration with their blind sz selected cluster sample @xcite .",
    "this compounds the question of why _ wmap _ sz analyses from @xcite and @xcite failed to find such an agreement .    in this paper",
    "we use the recent _ planck _ early data release and other radio source data to re - investigate both the _ wmap _ radio source beam profile and sz anomalies .",
    "the _ planck _ early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ) is of particular interest and provides the basic parameters of radio sources and sz clusters from the _ planck _ cmb maps .",
    "although , the corresponding temperature maps from which these were estimated have not been released , both radio source fluxes and sz profile parameters are available as measured by _ planck_. we can therefore use these to compare _ wmap _ and _ planck _ radio source fluxes directly and also to make _ wmap _ stacks centred now on the new radio source and sz cluster lists from _",
    "planck_. from these stacks , the _ wmap _ beam profile can be inferred and the sz results from _ wmap _ and _ planck _ compared .",
    "given the higher angular resolution , lower noise and different calibration strategy for _ planck _ , this comparison will allow new insight into the robustness of the _ wmap _ cmb analysis .",
    "the _ planck _ team have recently made their first release of data collected by the _ planck _",
    "satellite between 13 august 2009 and 6 june 2010 ( amounting to @xmath7 full sky surveys ) .",
    "this early data release is concerned solely with the foreground contamination in the cmb maps .",
    "the two sets of catalogues relevant to this paper form the early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ) .",
    "these are the radio source catalogues and the sz catalogue .",
    "the early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ) lists all the high reliability radio sources with accurate flux determinations .",
    "the ercsc has been quality controlled so that @xmath8 of the reported sources are reliable , @xmath9 , detections and that the fluxes are determined within @xmath1030% accuracy .",
    "the catalogues are band specific and for the bands of interest ( @xmath11 ) are created using the ` powellsnakes ' method , a bayesian multi - frequency algorithm for detecting discrete objects in a random background .",
    "flux estimates were obtained by use of aperture photometry within a circle of the beam s fwhm . for the case of unresolved and potentially faint point sources ,",
    "the _ planck _",
    "team recommend the use of the parameter flux and its corresponding error , flux_err @xcite .",
    "we reject any extended objects from the catalogue to maintain an unresolved sample with which to test the _ wmap _ data .",
    "to do this we have used the _ planck _",
    "quality tag ` extended ' .",
    "this is defined by comparing the source areal profile with the 2-d _ planck _ beam . an additional quality flag ` cmbsubtract '",
    "has also been provided , which reflects on the quality of the source detection in a map with the best estimate of the cmb removed .",
    "we minimise cmb contamination by using only cmbsubtract=0 sources .    when measuring the beam profile in section [ subsec : planckradioresults ] we further cut the catalogue to ensure the best quality sample .",
    "@xcite did suggest that their faintest _ wmap _ source samples were probably affected by @xcite bias . to ensure the robustness of our results against eddington bias",
    ", we have used a @xmath12jy flux cut , the same limit as previously used by @xcite .",
    "we have additionally rejected sources within @xmath13 of the lmc , sources at low galactic latitude , @xmath14 and any sources flagged by _",
    "planck _ as having high astrometric error .",
    "finally , we tightened the _ planck _ ` extended ' flag to remove any sources intrinsically wider than the _ wmap _ beam .",
    "the _ planck _ ` extended ' flag excludes sources with @xmath15 .",
    "we now ensure that the _ planck _",
    "sources are unresolved in the _ wmap _ maps by imposing cuts in both the major and minor axis so that both the fitted gaussian profiles ( gau ) and the local psf ( beam ) fwhm estimates are less than the fwhm of the _ wmap _ beam in the band being studied .",
    "band and colour corrections for the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ fluxes have been ignored .",
    "this factor is in any case small due to the typically flat spectral indices considered @xcite .",
    "the full details of the catalogue construction and composition are described by @xcite and briefly overviewed in table [ tb : bands - planckpara ] .",

    "the algorithm is run blindly on all - sky maps , assuming the characteristic sz spectral signature and self - similar cluster profile .    in the early release of the _ planck _ sz catalogue ,",
    "only data from the 100ghz frequency channel or higher has been used to study the sz effect .",
    "this is to avoid the detrimental effect on s / n from beam dilution caused by the larger beam sizes of the lower frequency channels . at the higher frequencies , the _",
    "beam fwhm is typically @xmath16 .",
    "the full details of the catalogue construction and composition are described by the @xcite .",
    "the catalogue provides estimates of the sz flux , extent , redshift and position .",
    "it consists of 189 clusters , all detected at high s / n ( @xmath17 ) with 95% reliability . whilst the sample is primarily composed of known clusters ( 169/189 ) , it provides a wealth of new information as it gives the first sz measurements for @xmath18 of the clusters . in this paper",
    "we only make use of clusters which have been pre - detected in the x - ray and have redshifts .",
    "we therefore , after masking , consider 151 clusters , including coma .",
    "for this sample the redshift range spans @xmath19 $ ] with a mean redshift of @xmath20 .      we will be using the 7-year _ wmap _ temperature maps obtained from the lambda cmb resource .",
    "we work with the @xmath21 ` healpix ` maps resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath22 .",
    "we use the foreground unsubtracted temperature band maps for q , v and w. our default _ wmap _ datasets are the co - added maps in q ( = q1+q2 ) , v ( = v1+v2 ) and w ( = w1+w2+w3+w4 ) .",
    "however , particularly in the w band , the increased s / n for radio source profiles obtained by using all the da s can be regarded as a trade - off with the precision of just using the narrowest w1 ( and w4 ) beams as previously used by @xcite . in using the co - added data ,",
    "the jupiter beams have to be combined before comparison with the data .",
    "we estimate the jupiter beam in each band by averaging the 7-year beam profiles from the various detector assemblies , assuming the appropriate correction for pixelisation @xcite . when working with radio point sources we use the point source catalogue mask ( ` wmap_point_source_catalog_mask ` ) . to avoid galactic contamination for the sz analyses",
    "we have instead used the extended temperature mask ( ` wmap_ext_temperature_analysis_mask ` ) which admits 71% of the sky .",
    "we have used the 7-year _ wmap _ 5-band point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "these sources are detected at least the 5@xmath23 level in one _ wmap _ band .",
    "for a flux density to be stated , the detection must be above the 2@xmath23 level in that band .",
    "following @xcite we ensure that the sources are genuinely point sources by matching to the 5ghz ( @xmath24 resolution ) catalogues from the greenbank northern sky survey ( gb6 , @xcite ) , or parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn , @xcite ) , surveys .",
    "wmap _ team also provide a 7 yr cmb - free catalogue as described by @xcite .",
    "this catalogue has been created with the objective of detecting point sources free of boosting by cmb fluctuations .",
    "we proceed with the raw 5-band catalogue with 471 sources and a cmb - free catalogue with 417 sources .",

    "the choice of coordinates to use for the radio source positions and cluster centres is important . scatter or an offset in the centroid used in the cross - correlation could cause the stacked result to appear artifically broad or induce artifacts .",
    "however , the only sample used in this paper for which astrometric errors are appreciable are the _ wmap _ derived radio - source catalogues where the astrometric error in both longitude and latitude is 4@xmath25 @xcite . we mitigate for this effect by using the position of the corresponding matched 5ghz source , since these have negligble astrometric error @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for an offset between the _ wmap _ and 5ghz sources and hence we are confident that astrometry error will not cause new broadening of the beam .",
    "we also note that the stacking procedure we use is dominated by the brighter objects , which typically have better astrometry .    for the _ planck _ radio source catalogues we have used the _ planck _",
    "positions since these are of high astrometric quality @xcite . in our sample selection",
    "we have rejected sources which the _ planck _ team estimate to have relatively high astrometric errors .",
    "the effect of this selection in the 100ghz band is to ensure that @xmath27 for the @xmath12jy sample .    for the _ planck _ esz objects we have taken the _ planck _ estimated positions rather than the x - ray derived positions as the cluster centres .",
    "we do this to avoid the complications associated with rare but potentially large offsets between the sz and x - ray signals which are likely caused by merging events @xcite .      our cross - correlation / stacking procedures for measuring both radio point source profiles and sz decrements are similar to those of @xcite , @xcite and then as updated by @xcite .",
    "ultimately , we shall be stacking / cross - correlating _ wmap _ data around radio source positions and cluster centres from catalogues , particularly from the _ planck _ ercsc . to estimate a temperature profile for an individual source _ j _ we use ,    @xmath28    where the sum is over the pixels , denoted _",
    ", within a circular annulus of radius @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 represents the number of pixels within the annulus and @xmath31 is the temperature recorded for the pixel _",
    "i _ and source _",
    "j_. @xmath32 is the average background temperature which can either be estimated locally in a surrounding annulus in a ` photometric method ' or globally ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these two background estimates make no difference in the stacked results but can make a difference for individual sources ( see section [ sec : szresults ] ) .",
    "we then stack the _ _ wmap__7 data by averaging @xmath33 over the sources that have pixels within the annulus @xmath29 using the statistical average , @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the number of sources that have pixels within the annulus @xmath29 and is usually constant for all except the @xmath36 bins .",
    "we have followed @xcite in using jack - knife errors , for both the radio and sz sources , based on 6 equal area sub - fields defined by lines of constant galactic longitude and split by the galactic equator .",
    "for @xmath37 fields denoted _ k _ , the errors are ,    @xmath38^{2 } \\big\\rangle , \\label{eq : errdefintion}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the average of the fields excluding field @xmath40 . we have experimented with both alternative sub - fields and methods such as bootstrap resampling finding approximately equivalent results . in section [ sec : sim ] we have used simulations to test whether our method can robustly recover the beam profile , in doing so we find that our jack - knife errors are reasonable .",
    "we first compare _ _ wmap__7 sources at q , v , w from @xcite to their counterparts in the _ planck _ ercsc at 100 , 70 and 44 ghz .",
    "we also compare the _ planck _ fluxes in the 100ghz band to the ground - based atca and iram source fluxes previously used by @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapdirectfluxcompare ] we first focus on the comparison of the _",
    "_ wmap__7 fluxes to _ planck _ and also the ground - based atca and iram sources .",
    "we only consider the matches with separation less than @xmath41 to avoid any possible systematic errors associated with sources that have poor astrometry .",
    "however , our results are independent of this cut up to separations of @xmath42 . at high fluxes",
    "we see evidence for a systematically lower _ wmap _ flux , @xmath43 above 2jy .",
    "this non - linearity is particularly prominent in the w band , the band with the greatest angular resolution .    since there are errors in both variables we have used the numerical recipes @xcite _ fitexy _ as our fitting routine .",
    "we find best fit logarithmic slopes of @xmath44 $ ] for the [ 100ghz - w,70ghz - v,44ghz - q ] comparisons . to obtain realistic errors on these fits",
    "we have linearly scaled the flux errors until we obtained a @xmath45 probability of 0.5 as recommended by @xcite , for data with a dominant intrinsic dispersion .    clearly , _",
    "planck _ and",
    "_ wmap _ fluxes for sources were measured at different times . since at least @xmath46% of the _ _",
    "wmap__5 radio sources exhibit some level of variability @xcite , we expect and observe much larger scatter than accounted for by the estimated flux uncertainty .",
    "however , we note that the brighter _ wmap _ sources are fainter than the one - to - one relation , this is in the opposite sense expected if variability was biasing faint _",
    "sources into the _ wmap _",
    "catalogue when in a bright phase .",
    "we investigate whether variability is alternatively causing a bias due to _ planck _ dropouts by limiting the _ wmap _ sample to @xmath47 sources .",
    "the advantage is that the _ planck _ team have investigated all the _ wmap _ @xmath47 objects that are not in the ercsc .",
    "they conclude that for the 100ghz - w comparison the missing objects are ` all ' spurious and can be explained by the object having a weak or missing 5ghz i d @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath47 _ wmap _ w - band sample of 48 sources ( with @xmath48 ) is therefore complete in the sense of being 100% represented in the _ planck _ sample with no bias due to a _",
    "planck _ dropout population .",
    "when we then repeat the _ wmap_-_planck _",
    "100ghz - w flux comparison , we find a logarithmic slope of ( @xmath49 ) , consistent with the original result and therefore strong evidence against a highly variable source population causing dropouts that bias the _ wmap_-_planck _ comparison .",
    "the disagreement between _ planck _ and _ wmap _ is in contrast to direct comparisons between _ planck _ and ground - based atca / iram data .",
    "these instead show good agreement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : planckwdirectfluxcompare ] for the _ planck _ 100ghz radio point sources .",
    "the best fit logarithmic slope of @xmath50 $ ] is statistically consistent with the one - to - one relation .",
    "however , comparing _",
    "wmap _ w - band and the ground - based atca / iram data we find evidence for non - linearity with a best fit logarithmic slope of @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "these contrasting fits are particularly significant because the greatest _",
    "planck_-_wmap _ non - linearity comes from the 100ghz - w flux comparison .",
    "given the agreement between _",
    "planck _ and the ground - based atca / iram observations , we interpret the flux disagreement as being due to _ wmap_.      in response to the referee we have made additional bootstrap and jack - knife re - sampling tests of the _ wmap_*_planck _ flux - flux comparison and its error . after 1000 bootstrap resamplings",
    "we estimate logarithmic slopes of @xmath52 $ ] for the [ 100ghz - w,70ghz - v,44ghz - q ] comparisons .",
    "we also perform jacknife resamplings of the _ wmap_*_planck _ flux - flux comparison , we estimate a logarithmic slope of @xmath53 $ ] for the [ 100ghz - w,70ghz - v,44ghz - q ] comparisons .",
    "these resampling results are consistent with our original samples and support the accuracy of our previous error analysis .",
    "we have also made monte - carlo simulations of the flux - flux comparison .",
    "we generated samples with the same number of sources as in the real flux - flux comparison using the _ wmap _ q - band power - law distribution , @xmath54 , @xcite .",
    "these fluxes are then scaled to the respective _ wmap _ and _ planck _ band centres on the basis of a gaussian distribution in spectral indices , @xmath55 , with mean -0.09 and standard deviation 0.176 , @xcite .",
    "realistic gaussian measurement errors are then assigned as a function of flux in a manner consistent with the original _ wmap _ and _ planck _ samples . to include variability we start from the @xcite analysis of the _ _ wmap__5 data that measured a median rms flux variability for the 25 brightest q - band objects of @xmath56 and which we therefore additionally apply to all our sources , assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "we then impose detection limits corresponding to the faintest source in the given band for the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ fluxes respectively . finally , we compare these two flux types by measuring the best fit relation in the same way as was originally done for the _",
    "planck_-_wmap _ comparison .",
    "after 10,000 simulations of the 100ghz - w comparison we find average logarithmic slopes and intercepts of @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "these results are not only in agreement with a one - to - one relation but support the errors found in our original _ wmap_-_planck _ comparison .",
    "we therefore conclude we are able to robustly recover the expected one - to - one result and hence that our comparison may be unbiased .",
    "@xcite have noted that the 100ghz bandpass contains the @xmath59 rotational co emission line .",
    "this is a potential explanation for the flux non - linearity we report between the _ wmap _ 94ghz w - band and _ planck _ 100ghz bands .",
    "however , such an explanation would imply that _ wmap _ and _ planck _ are in agreement away from the galactic plane where co emission is lower .",
    "however , we see no evidence for such a distinction , with galactic latitude cuts of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 we find 100ghz - w logarithmic slopes of @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 $ ] , and @xmath65 $ ] respectively .",
    "@xcite have made a comparison of _ wmap _ fluxes of bright radio source fluxes from ground - based telescopes and claim that they support the _ wmap _ flux scale .",
    "some of the sources used are planets and have not been through the same reduction procedures as the cmb maps but five other sources , cyg a , cas a , tau a , 3c58 and 3c274 have gone through the same procedures . @xcite selected these sources on the basis that they were the brightest and least variable of the sources with adequate background contrast and a history of prior observation .",
    "we now expand our flux comparisons by including these @xcite sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapdirectfluxcompare ] .",
    "we use the _ wmap _ fluxes quoted by these authors and the independent ground - based fluxes that are mostly those quoted by these authors .",
    "we see that in the w band at least , _ wmap _ also underestimates the flux of these sources ( blue points ) and indeed cyg a , 3c274 and 3c58 appear not inconsistent with our fitted relation . however",
    ", the underestimation for cas a is less than predicted by extrapolating the fit to the brighter radio fluxes .",
    "if this result were to be more highly weighted then there would still be evidence for a _ wmap _ flux problem , but one which now looked more like a constant offset than a scale error .",
    "however , we note that there are differences between the two ground - based observations of cas a. furthermore , cas a lies close to the galactic plane ( @xmath66 ) and hence contamination might be an issue",
    ". it may therefore be too early to infer a flux offset on the basis of this source .",
    "when we include the celestial sources from @xcite with independent ground - based measurements into the _",
    "planck_-_wmap _ comparison we find logarithmic slopes of @xmath67 $ ] for the [ 100ghz - w,70ghz - v,44ghz - q ] comparisons .",
    "after jack - knife and bootstrap resampling we find logarithmic slopes of @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] respectively for the [ 100ghz - w,70ghz - v,44ghz - q ] comparisons .",
    "hence , whilst including the celestial source data changes the degree of the non - linearity , the results are still in significant disagreement with a one - to - one relation .",
    "we finally add the _ planck _ ercsc measurements of these 5 sources to fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapdirectfluxcompare ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : planckwdirectfluxcompare ] .",
    "this complicates the picture further since they appear to agree with the _ wmap _ results more than the ground - based results .",
    "as far as we can see , the _ planck _",
    "fluxes are not calibrated via _",
    "wmap_. if we then fit the full _ planck_-_wmap _ w band comparison we now find less evidence for a discrepancy between the two finding a 100ghz - w logarithmic slope of @xmath70 $ ] . but just making the 100ghz - w comparison in the 3 - 400jy region , the result might then again look more like a constant offset with a logarithmic slope and intercept of @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that the _ wmap _ fluxes in the @xmath73jy region show systematically lower fluxes than _ planck _ and we have argued that this discrepancy is unlikely to be explained by variability , underestimated errors or inaccurate flux estimation . at lower and higher fluxes the _ wmap_-_planck _",

    "fig : radioproftempandbsplanck ] ( a),(b),(c ) are shown for completeness because these raw temperature plots demonstrate the main uncertainty in this analysis which is the accuracy of the background subtraction .",
    "we note that there is some difference between the global background and the background local to the source samples but generally this effect appears smaller in the _ _ wmap__7 data ( eg at w ) than it was in the _",

    "we further note that the statistical significance of the deviations from the jupiter beam for the _ planck _ selected sources at @xmath76 is only modest at @xmath77 for the w band .",

    "these results suggest that the previous radio source fit may be too wide at @xmath79 where it is essentially an extrapolation , unconstrained by the data , and this will affect the accuracy of its absolute normalisation i.e. there is a large error in @xmath80 . otherwise , the conclusion is similar to that from figs .

    "we repeat that at the flux limits used here , the simulations show no sign of such bias and so we are confident that this criticism does not apply to our results .",

    "there is very little difference between the jupiter and the timing offset beam .",
    "we note that this region is essentially unconstrained by the radio source profiles .",

    "we have compared sources from _ planck _ , _ wmap _ , _ wmap _ cmb - free and nvss catalogues .",
    "we find that in all cases the radio sources show wider profiles than the jupiter beam with little indication of eddington bias or dependence on the method of normalisation .",
    "applying our cross - correlation to realistic simulations strongly supports the accuracy of our beam profile measurements .",
    "however , it must be said that in the _ _ wmap__7 data the w radio source profiles are less wide than previously found by @xcite in the _",
    "_ wmap__5 release .",
    "the rejection of the jupiter beam is now only @xmath1 in the _ planck _ radio source comparison .",
    "but the rejection of the jupiter beam is reasonably consistent between the admittedly overlapping radio source samples from _ planck _ , _ wmap _ and nvss .",
    "we have therefore considered explanations for the wide profiles assuming that they are not statistical fluctuations .",
    "two such possibilities are a non - linearity in the _ wmap _ temperature scale and a timing offset in the _ wmap _ scan pattern as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the narrower profiles measured here compared to the @xcite _ _ wmap__5 profiles increase the possibility of their being explained by a timing offset .    we have also found discrepancies between _ wmap _ fluxes compared to _ planck _ and ground - based fluxes .",
    "for @xmath159jy the _ wmap _ fluxes look to have a non - linear relation with _ planck _ fluxes .",
    "however , when the further very bright sources discussed by @xcite with ground - based and _ planck _ measurements are included then this flux - flux discrepancy appears more like a linear than a non - linear offset .",
    "we have compared stacked _ wmap _",
    "sz decrements with those measured by _ planck _ and by ground - based observations .",
    "in contrast to previous reports we now find _ wmap _ agrees with both the _ planck _ and ground - based data .",
    "however this work is not at high enough s / n to distinquish between the timing offset beam of @xcite and the _ wmap _ jupiter beam .",
    "we have shown that transforming the jupiter beam using a model that fits the radio source profiles results in small but significant changes to the _ wmap _ @xmath156 . at the least",
