    "the existence of a net swimming velocity arises from a nonlinear interaction between the oscillatory particle inertia and the oscillatory drag in the presence of spatial asymmetries .",

    "a necessary condition for the existence of this non - zero velocity is that the dense swimmer undergoes deformation normal to its surface , while pure squirming does not result in locomotion .    in the previous analysis we have not included the effect of gravity , which needs to be considered in practical applications . for @xmath243 and @xmath244",
    ", we expect the net translational velocity due to the reciprocal motion to scale as @xmath245 while a typical sedimentation speed is @xmath246 thus , the dense swimmer needs to oscillate at a frequency @xmath247 in order to overcome gravity .    in conclusion ,",
    "our examples show the existence of a net translation or rotation at any arbitrarily small @xmath248 for certain spatially asymmetric , dense reciprocal swimmers .",
    "this demonstrates the breakdown of the scallop theorem for a case in which the flow around the swimmer is governed by the stokes equations , that is , in the absence of fluid inertia . while we have studied the limit of dense swimmers , for which @xmath249 , in many biological applications @xmath250 and the unsteady fluid inertia is expected to be comparable to the particle inertia .",
