    "in the almost 25 years since the pioneering work of polyakov @xcite and susskind @xcite much effort has been devoted to attempts to understand both the basic physics and quantitave features of the deconfining phase transition of qcd .    the high temperature phase , i.e. for temperatures well above the critical temperature @xmath0 , is becoming well understood , and is widely believed to resemble a plasma of almost free quarks and gluons .",
    "however , the transition region , @xmath1 , is very poorly understood .",
    "this region is the most interesting one since it is there that the transition between ` hadronic ' and ` partonic ' degrees of freedom occurs .",
    "the study of the transition region is a complicated and inherently non - perturbative problem which has mostly evaded treatment by analytical methods .",
    "the variational method introduced several years by kogan and kovner @xcite appears well suited to a discussion of such a problem .",
    "recently , the method was applied to the study of the phase transition in @xmath2 gluodynamics . as a result of these studies @xcite",
    ", we identified a first order phase transition at a transition temperature , in units of the lighest state in the theory , of @xmath3 , in complete agreement with the lattice estimate for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we minimize the relevant thermodynamic potential at finite temperature , i.e. the helmholtz free energy , on a set of suitably chosen trial density matrix functionals .",
    "as with any variational calculation there is an element of guesswork involved .",
    "however , the choice of the trial states is dictated by rather general principles .",
    "as in the quantum mechanical case , the trial state ought to be simultaneously rich enough to span the interesting physics and to lead to calculable results .",
    "this last requirement is particularly stringent , since only functional integrals of the gaussian form can be explicitly evaluated .",
    "specific to the quantum field case are the requirements of gauge invariance and of correct uv behaviour . to understand this last statement",
    ", it suffices to mention first , that the free energy is dominated by uv modes while we are interested in the ir physics and , second , that in an asymptotically free theory such as gluodynamics , low and high momentum modes are , in general , non - separable .",
    "the method of @xcite to be discussed below accommodates all these requirements , leading to what is , to the author s best knowledge , the only first principle analytical analysis of the deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics .",
    "we consider density matrices which , in the field basis , have gaussian matrix elements and where gauge invariance is explicitly imposed by projection onto the gauge - invariant sector of the hilbert space @xmath5 =   \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\int du \\ ; \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{x , y } \\big [ a_{i}^{a } ( x ) g^{-1 ab}_{ij}(x , y ) a_{j}^{b}(y ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{2.5cm}+ a^{'ua}_{i } ( x ) g^{-1 ab}_{ij}(x ,",

    "we take the variational functions diagonal in both colour and lorentz indices , and translationally invariant @xmath15 further , we split the momenta into high and low modes with @xmath16 and restrict the kernels @xmath17 and @xmath18 to the one parameter momentum space forms @xmath19    the logic behind this choice of ansatz is the following . at finite temperature",
    "we expect @xmath20 to be roughly proportional to the bolzmann factor @xmath21 . in our ansatz ,",
    "the role of one particle energy is played by the variational function @xmath22 and its form is motivated by the propagator of a massive scalar field , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "we will be interested only in temperatures close to the phase transition , and those we anticipate to be small , @xmath24 .",
    "for those temperatures one particle modes with momenta @xmath25 are not populated , and we thus put @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "the bolzmann factor is non - vanishing , but small .",
    "further , it depends only very weakly on the value of the momentum . with the above restrictions on the kernels , only two variational parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath18 , remain .",
    "importantly , the density matrix functional in eq .",
    "( [ qcdans ] ) describes , for @xmath29 , a pure state @xmath30><\\psi [ a]|$ ] where @xmath31 $ ] are gaussian wave functionals . for @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ qcdans ] ) describes a mixed state with @xmath33 proportional to the entropy of the trial density matrix .    the expectation value of a gauge invariant operator in the variational state eq .",

    "for @xmath35 we get , in leading order in @xmath18 , @xmath40    we now integrate out the high momentum , @xmath41 , modes of @xmath8 perturbatively to one - loop order .",
    "this effects a renormalization group transformation on the low modes , replacing the bare coupling @xmath42 by the running coupling @xmath43 @xcite . to one - loop accuracy , the coupling @xmath43 runs identically to the yang - mills coupling @xcite .",
    "the normalization @xmath35 can be then interpreted as the generating functional @xmath45 for an effective non - linear @xmath44-model for the low momentum modes ( @xmath46 ) defined by the action @xmath47\\nonumber\\\\      & \\quad- \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 } h m^2 { { \\mathrm{tr}}}u^\\dagger { { \\mathrm{tr}}}u\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 independent pieces have been dropped .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 plays the same role as polyakov s loop @xmath48 at finite temperature  the functional integration over @xmath8 projects out the physical subspace of the large hilbert space on which the hamiltonian of gluodynamics is defined .",
    "this @xmath44-model has a phase transition @xcite at the critical point ( for @xmath49mev , @xmath50 and with the one - loop yang - mills @xmath51 function ) @xmath52 for @xmath53 , the @xmath44-model is in a disordered , @xmath54 symmetric , phase with massive excitations and where @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath8 is the polyakov loop , this corresponds to a confined state .",
    "when @xmath56 , the @xmath44-model is in an ordered , @xmath57 symmetric , phase with massless goldstone bosons for which @xmath58 , corresponding to a deconfined state . with this analysis",
    "we have established a correspondence between the @xmath44-model phase transition and the deconfinement transition in @xmath2 gluodynamics .",
    "in fact , this correspondence can be argued in rather general terms . instead of restricting ab initio the density matrix to the form eq .",
    "( [ qcdans ] ) , imagine that we take some arbitrary gauge - invariant density matrix ansatz that depends on the @xmath39 fields and is integrated over the @xmath8 fields .",
    "we allow this new ansatz ( and whatever kernels it may contain ) to remain arbitrary until we have no choice but to restrict it",
    ". then we integrate out the a fields to obtain a partition function of @xmath8 fields with respect to some action .",
    "next we introduce a separation of momenta into high and low modes with @xmath16 and integrate out the high mode @xmath8 fields as before .",
    "this effects a renormalisation group transformation on the low modes , replacing the bare coupling @xmath42  which is not arbitrary , since it is defined by the gauge transformations eq .",
    "( [ gt ] )  by the running coupling @xmath43 .",
    "now provided our ansatz is sufficiently close to the correct density matrix for @xmath2 , the theory will be asymptotically free .",
    "we are thus left with an action for the low modes which is , once again , a complicated @xmath44-model , with a renormalised coupling @xmath43 which we expect to be small provided @xmath28 is large , and vice versa .    now consider this model as a statistical mechanical model at ` temperature ' @xmath43 .",
    "we make the plausible assumption that this @xmath44-model will , as @xmath28 is varied , undergo a symmetry - breaking transition at ` temperature ' @xmath59 from a ` thermally disordered ' ( symmetric ) phase at large @xmath59 to an ordered phase at small @xmath59 .",
    "further , it is clear  since the polyakov loop @xmath60 is zero in the former phase and non - zero in the latter  that this @xmath44-model phase transition corresponds directly to the deconfinement transition in the @xmath2 theory .    on review ,",
    "it is clear that our only assumptions are that the ansatz is sufficiently close to @xmath2 and that the low mode @xmath44-model undergoes a symmetry - breaking phase transition . in particular , let the ansatz , which is arbitrary and need not be gaussian , be the _ correct _ density matrix for @xmath2 .",
    "the first assumption is certainly true .",
    "if the second assumption is also true , then we have constructed an exact argument that the deconfinement transition in @xmath2 corresponds to the phase transition in the low mode @xmath44-model .",
    "thus , in order to study deconfinement in @xmath2 , our aim should be to model the physics of each @xmath44-model phase as accurately as possible and calculate the transition scale @xmath61 .",
    "we then calculate the free energy of @xmath2 in each phase , including any possible contribution from the high modes , at temperature @xmath62 and extract the minimal free energy .",
    "the deconfinement transition occurs at the temperature for which the free energies calculated in the ordered and disordered phases of the low mode @xmath44-model coincide .",
    "although we will take eq .",
    "( [ qcdans ] ) as the ansatz for the density matrix , we shall keep the kernels @xmath17 and @xmath18 arbitrary until we have no choice but to restrict them .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath63 of the density matrix @xmath36 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the standard yang - mills hamiltonian @xmath66\\ , , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 @xmath68 is the entropy , and @xmath69 is the temperature .",
    "thus @xmath70    in the disordered phase , no progress seems possible without restricting the arbitrary kernels .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the forms eq .",
    "( [ rkers ] ) . for small @xmath18",
    ", we consider only the first non - trivial order in @xmath18 , that is a term of @xmath71 in the entropy .",
    "this term can be written as a product of left @xmath2 and right @xmath2 currents and does , therefore , vanish in the disordered , @xmath54 symmetric , phase @xcite .",
    "the remaining contribution to the free energy , the average of the hamiltonian , is evaluated in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the free energy is minimized for @xmath72 @xmath73    the simplest option to evaluate the free energy in the disordered phase is to use perturbation theory .",
    "perturbation is certainly appropriate for large enough values of @xmath28 , where the expectation value of the @xmath8 field is close to unity . from numerical studies",
    "@xcite it is known that the transition occurs when the expectation value of @xmath8 is greater than @xmath74 .",
    "we can thus expect perturbation theory to be qualitatively reliable down to the transition point . in the leading order perturbation theory approximation to the ordered phase of the @xmath44-model , however , minimisation with respect to arbitrary kernels @xmath17 and @xmath18 for both high and low modes is possible .",
    "further , the analysis can be carried out to all orders in the thermal disorder kernel @xmath18 .    in this approximation",
    ", the @xmath8 matrices can be parameterised in the standard exponential form and expanded in the coupling @xmath75 @xmath76 hence at leading order one can take @xmath77 thus , the gauge transformations ( [ gt ] ) reduce to @xmath78 and the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reduces to @xmath79\\ , .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] these last two equations describe the theory @xmath80 : in the leading order of @xmath44-model perturbation theory , the @xmath2 yang  mills theory reduces to the @xmath80 free theory .",
    "moreover , the density matrix eq .",
    "( [ qcdans ] ) becomes gaussian again , because the gauge transformations are linear .",

    "the free energy in momentum space in terms of the arbitrary kernels @xmath17 and @xmath18 is @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad- \\log \\big [ \\frac{1- ( 1-(gh)^2)^{1/2}}{gh}\\big ] \\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\quad\\cdot\\big ( \\frac{1- ( 1-(gh)^2)^{1/2}}{(1-(gh)^2)^{1/2}-(1-gh ) } \\big ) \\big ) \\bigg]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kernels which minimise the free energy are @xmath86 and the minimal value of the free energy at temperature @xmath62 is @xmath87    so we see that the free energy of @xmath2 is minimised with @xmath88 in the disordered phase of the @xmath44-model for temperatures from zero up to a temperature @xmath0 where @xmath89 which in turn implies @xmath90",
    "we find that the deconfinement phase transition is strongly first order with a transition temperature of @xmath91 .",
    "the transition is due to an abrupt jump in the entropy . in the disordered phase it is zero",
    "since glueballs are heavy and , therefore , their contribution is suppressed by the boltzmann factor @xmath92 . in the ordered phase ,",
    "the entropy is non - vanishing and proportional to the number of coloured states .",
    "the major uncertainty in the calculation is due to the fact that the scale @xmath61 is very sensitive to the mean field approximation .",
    "it is , therefore , only meaningful to compare the results of our approach with lattice estimates for @xmath61 independent quantities .",
    "for one such quantity , the transition temperature in units of the mass of the lightest glueball in the model , i.e. @xmath93 @xcite , we find @xmath94 which is in agreement with the lattice result .",
