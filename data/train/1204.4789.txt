    "microlensing constitutes one of the major methods to detect and characterize extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "the method is sensitive to planets that are difficult to be detected by using other methods such as cool planets at or beyond the snow line @xcite and planets at large distances @xcite .",
    "it is also sensitive to low - mass planets @xcite , making it possible to detect terrestrial planets from ground observations . due to the weak dependence on the host - star brightness",
    ", it also enables to detect planets around low - mass stars down to m - type dwarfs @xcite and even to sub - stellar mass objects .",
    "in addition , it is the only method that can detect old planetary - mass objects that are not bound to stars @xcite . therefore , microlensing is important for the complete census of the frequency and properties of planets @xcite .",
    "current microlensing planet searches are being conducted based on a specially designed strategy where survey and follow - up observations work in close coordination .",
    "there are two main reasons for this strategy .",
    "the first reason is that the probability of a lensing event is very low . for a star located in the galactic bulge , toward which planetary microlensing searches are being conducted ,",
    "the chance to detect a lensed star at a specific time is of order @xmath3 @xcite . considering that a planet can be detected for a small fraction of lensing events , it is essential to maximize the detection rate of lensing events to increase the rate of planet detections",
    ". survey observations are designed for this purpose by monitoring a large area of the galactic bulge field .",
    "the second reason for the survey / follow - up strategy is that the duration of a planetary signal is short .",
    "the planetary signal is a short - term perturbation to the smooth standard light curve of the primary - induced lensing event . to densely cover planetary perturbations , follow - up observations are designed to focus on events detected by survey observations .    under the current strategy of microlensing searches , high - magnification events are important targets for follow - up observations .",
    "a typical number of events alerted at a certain time by survey experiments is of order 10 . considering that each event typically lasts for several dozens of days , it is difficult to follow all alerted events with a restricted number of telescopes . to maximize the planet detection efficiency ,",
    "therefore , priority is given to events for which the planet detection probability is high .",
    "currently , the highest priority is given to high - magnification events .",
    "for a lens with a planet , there exist two sets of disconnected caustics , where one set is located away from the planet - host star ( planetary caustic ) while the other set is always located close to the host star ( central caustic ) . for a high - magnification event",
    ", the sensitivity to a planetary companion is very high because the source trajectory always passes close to the perturbation region around the central caustic induced by the planet @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the strategy focusing on high - magnification events is demonstrated by the fact that 7 out of 13 microlensing planets detected as of the end of 2011 were detected through this channel .",
    "perturbations near the peak of a high - magnification lensing event ( central perturbations ) can be produced not only by a planet but also by a binary companion @xcite . for a binary lens where the projected separation between the lens components is substantially smaller than the einstein radius ( close binary )",
    ", there exists a small single set of caustics formed around the barycenter of the binary . for a binary where the projected separation is substantially larger than the einstein radius ( wide binary ) , on the other hand ,",
    "there exist two sets of caustics each of which is located close to each lens component .",
    "then , for a high - magnification event resulting from the source trajectory passing close to the center of mass of a close binary or close to one of the lens components of a wide binary , there can be a short - term perturbation near the peak of the lensing light curve , similar to the central perturbation induced by a planet .",
    "it is known that the central perturbation induced by a planet can be generally distinguished from that induced by a binary because the caustic shapes and the resulting magnification patterns around the two types of caustics are different from each other .    in this paper , we present a case of central perturbations for which it is difficult to distinguish between the planetary and binary interpretations . in @xmath42 , we describe details of the degeneracy . in @xmath43 , we demonstrate the degeneracy for two microlensing events ogle-2011-blg-0526 and ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336 that were detected during the 2011 observation season . in @xmath44 , we summarize the results and conclude .",

    "the central caustics form a closed figure that is composed of concave curves that meet at cusps .",
    "the general magnification pattern is that a positive perturbation occurs when the source is located in the region outside the caustic extending from cusps while a negative perturbation occurs when the source is located in the region between cusps . here",
    "a `` positive '' ( `` negative '' ) perturbation means that the magnification of the perturbed part of the light curve is higher ( lower ) than the magnification of the corresponding single - lensing event .",

    "we note that the size of the caustic for the binary with @xmath43 is scaled by the einstein radius corresponding to the total mass of the lens , while the caustic size for the binary with @xmath42 is scaled by the einstein radius corresponding to the mass of the lens component that the source approaches .",
    "the findings from the comparison of the local solutions and the corresponding lens - system geometries are summarized as below .    1",
    ".   for both events , @xmath0 differences from the best - fit single - lensing models are very big .",

    "the planetary solution is favored over the binary solution with @xmath46 105 and thus the stellar binary model is formally excluded . however , from the visual inspection of the residuals , it is found that systematic residuals of the data from the planetary model are larger than the difference between the planetary and binary models . in addition , the ctio , danish , and ogle data of overlapping coverage appear to be different from each other by an amount at least as large as the difference between the planetary and stellar binary models .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to claim a planet discovery based on < 1% variations in the light curve .",
    "3 .   for a pair of solutions with similar mass ratios , the solutions with @xmath42 and @xmath43 result in a similar caustic shape .",
    "the degeneracy between these solutions , often referred to as @xmath47 degeneracy , is known to be caused by the symmetry of the lens - mapping equation between close and wide binaries @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy between the pairs of solutions with planetary and binary mass ratios corresponds to the degeneracy mentioned in @xmath4 2 . to be noted",
    "is that despite the large difference in caustic shape , the resulting perturbations appear to be very alike .",
    "the planet / binary degeneracy introduced in this work was not known before .",
    "this is mostly because the caustics induced by a planet and a binary companion have very different shapes and thus it is widely believed that perturbations induced by the two types of companions can be easily distinguished .",
    "considering that two events of a single season suffer from this degeneracy along with the fact that perturbations caused by non - caustic - crossing source trajectories have larger cross sections , it is expected that central perturbations suffering from this is common .",
    "we introduced a new type of degeneracy in the planet / binary interpretation of central perturbations in microlensing light curves .",
