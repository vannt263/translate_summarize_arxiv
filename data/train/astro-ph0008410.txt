    "a small number of supernovae ( sne ) have been detected in x - rays in the near aftermath ( @xmath4years ) of their explosions .",
    "sn  1978k , sn  1980k , sn  1986j , sn  1987a , and sn  1993j were found before 1995 ( see schlegel 1995 for a review ) ; more recent detections include sn  1979c , sn  1988z , and sn  1994i ( immler , pietsch , & aschenbach 1998a , b ) and sn  1999em ( fox & lewin 1999 ) . here",
    "we report on observations of  ( pollas 1995 ) .",
    "supernova x - ray emission depends on the density structure of the progenitor s stellar wind as well as the structure of the sn ejecta , through which the initial shock passes .",
    "after the shock wave emerges from the star , the characteristic velocity is @xmath410@xmath7 km s@xmath6  and the density distribution in the outer parts of the star can be approximated by a power - law in radius , @xmath8 , where the value of @xmath9 ranges from @xmath47 to @xmath420 ( models for sn1987a have @xmath10 ; matzner & mckee 1999 ) . the shock then propagates into the circumstellar material , typically a slow - moving wind with a density that decreases with the inverse square of the radius , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the stellar wind mass - loss rate and @xmath13 is the wind velocity ( typically @xmath410 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the collision between the stellar ejecta and the circumstellar material produces a second ` reverse ' shock at @xmath41000 km s@xmath6 in the stellar ejecta ( which is expanding at @xmath410@xmath7 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the forward shock produces a very hot shell ( @xmath410@xmath14 k ) , while the reverse shock produces a denser , cooler shell ( @xmath410@xmath15 k ) with much higher emission measure , from which the observable x - ray emission arises ( chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "this picture is modified if the stellar wind is clumpy ; then the forward shock front in the clumps can yield cooler , stronger emission than the shock front in the diffuse wind ( chugai 1993 ) .",
    "the exact time of the explosion of  in the host galaxy  is not known , but it may have occurred as much as ten months before its optical discovery in may 1995 ( benetti , bouchet & schwarz 1995 ) , making the supernova @xmath42 years old at the epoch of first detection ( lewin , zimmermann , & aschenbach 1996 ) .",
    "was only the fourth supernova to be detected in x - rays so soon after its explosion .",
    "regular observations of the x - ray temperature , luminosity , and line - of - sight hydrogen column density will help determine the structure of the sn ejecta , the structure of the circumstellar medium established by the wind of the progenitor , and the details of its evolution prior to the explosion .",
    "these constraints can lead to an estimate of the progenitor stellar type and the type and length of its ( pre - explosion ) evolutionary stages .",
    "we first observed  in july 1996 with _ rosat _  when the optical ( benetti et al .",
    "1995 ; garnavich & challis 1995 ) and radio ( van dyk et al .",
    "1996 ) properties of this supernova made it a promising candidate for strong x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray detection of  with this pointing ( lewin et al .",
    "1996 ) prompted our longer follow - up observation that august .",
    "in addition , we were awarded time for another _ rosat _  observation in august 1997 , and applied simultaneously for _ asca _  spectral observations .",
    "execution of our _ asca _  observation in january 1998 completed the program for this paper .",

    "the interpretation of the x - ray emission from these sources is not clear .",
    "chevalier & fransson ( 1994 ) presented models in which smooth supernova ejecta interact with a smooth circumstellar wind . in this picture , the reverse shock emission is characterized by @xmath16  kev and the forward shock emission by @xmath17  kev . however , the radio emission ( see weiler et al .",
    "1990 for sn  1986j ) and narrow optical line emission give evidence that the circumstellar medium is clumpy and shock waves are being driven into the clumps ( see chugai et al .",
    "1995 on the case of sn  1978k ) .",
    "supernovae like sn  1978k and sn  1988z show very narrow line emission , which can be attributed to dense circumstellar clumps that are photo - ionized by the x - ray emission , and line components with a width of @xmath18  km s@xmath6that can be from cooling shocks moving into the clumps",
    ".  also shows evidence for these line components ( a.v .",
    "filippenko , priv . comm . ) .",
    "shock waves in clumps can give cooler x - ray emission than the forward shock front in the diffuse circumstellar medium .",
    "chugai ( 1993 ) found that this picture may be preferred for the x - ray emission from sn  1986j .",
    "a prediction of this model is that the emitting region should have a lower characteristic velocity than in the case of the reverse shock wave .",
    "our series of flux measurements show that the x - ray luminosity of  has probably dimmed by 30% and then brightened by as much as a factor of two over the period of observation , which corresponds to an age range of 2.0 to 3.5 years for a proposed explosion date in july  1994 ( benetti et al .",
    "the x - ray light curve of sn  1978k shows approximately constant luminosity over the age range of 12 to 16 years ( schlegel , petre , & colbert 1996 ) . for sn  1986j , a decline in luminosity has been observed over the age range 8.6 to 13 years ( houck et al .",
    "1998 ) ; the evolution is consistent with a @xmath19 time dependence . in the models of chevalier & fransson ( 1994 ) ,",
    "a decline in flux is expected if the evolution is non - radiative , whereas a radiative reverse shock front leads to a roughly constant luminosity . in the clump model ( chugai 1993 ) , the evolution depends on the variation of clump properties with radius .",
    "the light curve that we observe may be due to such variation .",
    "characterization of the radio observations of  is not yet complete .",
    "however , five 8.4  ghz radio observations made between july  1995 and june  1998 are all consistent with a constant flux of 3.8  mjy ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) , indicating only mild evolution of the radio properties of the shocked region over this interval .    in table",
    "[ tbl : iin ] , we give the estimated temperature characterizing the x - ray emission , although it is only in the case of sn  1986j that an x - ray line has been detected ( houck et al .",
    "1998 ) , and hence , the presence of thermal emission confirmed .",
    "possible non - thermal sources of x - ray emission are inverse compton and synchrotron emission , but these are typically less efficient than thermal emission ( chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "the temperature that we find is higher than expected for the reverse shock wave , but somewhat lower than that expected for the forward shock wave .",
    "if the emission is from shocked clumps , the temperature depends on the density of the clumps , so that intermediate temperatures are possible .",
    "the lack of detectable line emission does not allow us to directly test for the presence of clumps by examining the widths of lines .",
    "the gas column density that we measure to the source is compatible ( within our roughly 50% uncertainty ) with the expected column density in our galaxy .",
    "table [ tbl : iin ] shows that a higher column density is present to sn  1986j , but that can be attributed to absorption within the parent galaxy ( houck et al .",
    "these supernovae do not show evidence for absorption by the dense shell that might be formed by a cooling reverse shock wave .",
    "since the cool shell formed by a reverse shock will probably not be ionized , two years or more after the sn explosion , this low absorption may indicate inhomogeneities in the shell that allow the x - ray flux to emerge without absorption .",
    "alternatively , low absorption may be seen as supporting the clump model ( chugai 1993 ) , since the x - ray emission from forward shocks penetrating high - density clumps will not be significantly absorbed .",
    "our observations show that  belongs to the class of x - ray luminous type  iin supernovae .",
    "the variations in x - ray flux over a 1.5  yr period suggest that the emission mechanism is more complicated than simple radiative emission from a reverse shock wave generated by interaction with a dense circumstellar medium , and that inhomogeneities in the circumstellar medium play a role .",
    "the x - ray emission is expected to power the optical / ultraviolet emission from the supernova ; thus , optical spectroscopy will provide information on the gas motions so that a model for the supernova and the circumstellar structure can be determined .",
