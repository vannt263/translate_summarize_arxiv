    "pair creation in an external field has a long history pioneered by the discovery of the klein paradox @xcite , which was further investigated by sauter @xcite .",
    "they found that tunneling from a positive frequency state to a negative frequency state can occur in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this is a paradox in view of single - particle theory .",
    "if one treats it as a problem in quantum field theory , the paradox is resolved and particle pair creation from vacuum is concluded .    another approach to pair creation in an external field",
    "is based on heisenberg  euler effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "heisenberg and euler found that the 1-loop effective action of qed in a classical electric field has an imaginary part , which means a vacuum in an electric field is unstable against creation of particle  antiparticle pairs . in 1951 , schwinger fully formalized it using the proper time method @xcite , and thus particle creation in a classical electric field is called schwinger mechanism .",
    "he derived the famous formula for pair creation probability per unit volume and time : @xmath0 from a vacuum persistence probability @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an electric field strength and @xmath3 is mass of electron .",
    "this non - perturbative particle creation mechanism in strong external fields has a wide range of applications ; not only original qed problems but also pair creation in non - abelian electromagnetic fields @xcite and gravitational backgrounds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mott transition ( metal - insulator transition ) can be discussed in analogue with the schwinger mechanism @xcite .    for @xmath4 pair creation , an electric field strength of the order or above the critical value @xmath5 v / cm is needed , which is beyond current technological capabilities .",
    "the prospects to observe the schwinger mechanism at future x - ray laser facilities are investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb field of superheavy nuclei may cause non - perturbative @xmath4 creation @xcite .",
    "also the possibility that a supercritical electric field is generated at the surface of bare strange stars is proposed@xcite .",
    "in contrast , sufficiently strong field strengths are expected to be obtained in color electric fields which are formed just after collisions between high energy particles , such as @xmath4 and heavy ions . for example , in the framework of color glass condensate ( cgc ) , an initial field strength @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is a saturation scale of colliding nuclei and @xmath8 is a strong coupling ) is realized in heavy - ion collisions at rhic ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the schwinger mechanism is supposed to be a relevant mechanism for hadronic production .",
    "pair creation by the schwinger mechanism in @xmath4 collisions was first studied by casher et al.@xcite with the color flux tube model , in which a color electric field between @xmath9 is treated as a constant and classical electric field .",
    "a considerable number of studies on pair creation in flux tubes have followed shifting its stage from @xmath4 collisions to heavy - ion collisions ; the lund model @xcite , finite - time corrections @xcite , finite - size corrections for longitudinal direction ( the direction of the electric field ) @xcite and for transverse direction @xcite , perturbation around a background field @xcite and effects of back reaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kinetic equations incorporating pair creation from backgrounds have been investigated based on semi - classical theory @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the pair creation probability has been applied to a number of studies on particle production in high energy collisions . from eq .",
    "it is recognized that the pair creation probability expresses that for collapse of vacuum .",
    "therefore , the pair creation probability has no direct information about number of created particles and @xmath10 are confused in some papers , however , they are different quantity . @xmath11 can be equated with @xmath12 only if @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) . ] and becomes invalid after vacuum collapses , or particles are created .",
    "furthermore , there is a possibility that pair annihilation occurs . in view of these circumstances , it is more straightforward to treat a particle mean number @xmath14 , which has direct information about particle number , than to treat the pair creation probability",
    ". thus , we deal with mostly a particle mean number , or a distribution function in this paper .    to get a particle mean number ,",
    "we must quantize charged particle fields and define a particle picture specifically .",
    "in other words , we need to define creation and annihilation operators of a particle and an antiparticle . for this purpose ,",
    "canonical quantization is more suitable than path - integral quantization . formulating",
    "the schwinger mechanism in terms of canonical quantization has been done by nikishov @xcite as the resolution of the klein paradox .",
    "however , how the distribution evolves in time has been unknown in that method because only asymptotic states , in and out , are defined .",
    "also longitudinal kinetic momentum distributions of created particles have not been obtained because kinetic momentum is inseparably connected with time in an electric field .",
    "this obscurity of a longitudinal momentum distribution is closely related to the following paradox @xcite .",
    "suppose that observer _ a _ watches pair creation in a homogeneous and steady electric field , and gets a phase space distribution function of created particles @xmath15 , which is independent of the space  time coordinates because the electric field is constant in space and time .",
    "furthermore , let observer _",
    "b _ move relatively to _ a _ along the direction of the electric field .",
    "then , observer _ b _ obtains the same distribution with _ a _ , namely @xmath15 , because a phase space distribution is scalar with respect to lorentz boost . if rewritten in terms of momentum in _ b _",
    "s coordinates @xmath16 , this distribution takes a different functional form from _ a _",
    "s ; @xmath17 , except the case that @xmath15 is independent of the momentum in the direction of the electric field .",
    "for example , if _ a _ observes that a particle is created with 0 momentum , then _",
    "b _ observes this particle is created with non - zero momentum .",
    "this inequivalence of two observers contradicts the fact that the electric field is boost - invariant along its direction .",
    "that is to say , the uniform electric field takes the same strength and the same configuration in both _ a _ s and _ b _ s frame , and thus _ a _ and _ b _ are on an equal footing .",
    "therefore , the distribution which depends on the longitudinal momentum conflicts with the boost invariance of the system .",
    "this paradox has made a longitudinal momentum distribution in a homogeneous and constant electric field unidentified .",
    "another obstacle to revealing a momentum distribution in an electric field is ambiguity of particle picture . in an external field which breaks poincar@xmath18 invariance",
    ", we lose the criterion to define what is particle \" , while in free minkowski space we have the criterion of positive and negative frequency with regard to poincar@xmath18 invariance .",
    "because of this difficulty , longitudinal momentum distributions have been obtained only after an electric field is switched off @xcite .    in this paper , we reveal a longitudinal momentum distribution and its time evolution by introducing instantaneous positive and negative frequency solutions .",
    "we decompose the field operator into positive and negative frequency parts instantaneously .",
    "this procedure extracts the information of a particle picture from the field operator .",
    "creation and annihilation operators of a particle and an antiparticle are obtained by this decomposition . because the field operator evolves non - trivially under the influence of an electric field , the creation and annihilation operators have time - dependence ; @xmath19 .",
    "this time - dependent particle picture enables us to see the time evolution of the momentum distribution @xmath20 .    to get a dynamical view of how an intense electric field decays into particles is important to gain an understanding of the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "how quarks and gluons thermalize after heavy - ion collisions , especially short thermalization time @xmath21 @xmath22 expected from hydrodynamic calculations ( e.g.@xcite ) , is not fully understood , although there has been numerous attempts to understand the thermalization process ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cgc predicts that there are strong longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields just after collisions of heavy nuclei , the state of which is called glasma @xcite .",
    "thus , the color flux tube model is supported by the cgc and attracts renewed interest . in this circumstances ,",
    "decay of a color electric field due to the schwinger mechanism @xcite plays a pivotal role at the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recently , a thermalization scenario based on the analogy between the schwinger mechanism and the hawing - unruh effect has been proposed @xcite . however , as already noted , there remains a dearth of understanding of the schwinger mechanism in spite of its long history .",
    "in particular , we need to study effects of a longitudinal magnetic field , which is a new point in the glasma flux tube . thus , in this paper we re - investigate the schwinger mechanism as well as effects of a longitudinal magnetic field strictly based on quantum field theory , not on the semi - classical approximation @xcite or the kinetic approach @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the formulation of the schwinger mechanism in terms of canonical quantization for both bosons ( scalar qed ) and fermions ( spinor qed ) based on mainly ref.@xcite .",
    "a kinetic momentum distribution in the direction of the electric field can not be obtained by this method because only asymptotic states at @xmath23 , which are labeled by not kinetic momentum but canonical momentum , are defined .    in sec.[sec : pl ] , we fully reveal the momentum distribution of created particles in a homogeneous and steady electric field by defining a particle picture instantaneously .",
    "the resultant distributions are static and do not give us dynamical view of pair creation , because the background electric field is static .",
    "we explain how the longitudinal momentum dependence of the distribution is compatible with the electric field which is boost - invariant to the longitudinal direction .",
    "we also show that a magnetic field parallel to the electric field suppresses pair creation of bosons and enhances that of fermions .    in sec.[sec",
    ": nonste ] , we deal with non - steady electric fields , strength of which is 0 at first time and non - zero later",
    ". this set - up of electric fields enables us to investigate the time evolution of distributions .",
    "the particle picture associated with instantaneous positive and negative frequency solutions offers us physically reasonable behavior of the distributions , although it has been criticized in cosmological particle creation . also the time evolution of total particle number density and charge current",
    "is shown .    in sec.[sec : br ] , we consider back reaction , which is an electric field generated by particles created from an initial electric field .",
    "the distributions show plasma oscillation , which is a classical dynamics .",
    "they are also influenced by quantum effect , namely bose enhancement or pauli blocking .",

    "the idea of instantaneous positive and negative frequency was used to study particle creation in expanding universes .",
    "however , it encounters some difficulties and is strongly criticized @xcite .",

    ", @xmath113 falls off with negative power of @xmath225 for high momentum @xmath62 . especially for anisotropic case , @xmath113 behaves like @xmath226 for high momentum , and therefore the particle number per unit volume @xmath227 diverges @xcite .",
    "this is physically unacceptable .",
    "because of above - mentioned problem , other approach is believed to be a correct one to treat cosmological particle creation .",
    "it is adiabatic approach @xcite . in the adiabatic approach ,",
    "a physical fock space is fixed by expanding the field operator by the exact solutions whose asymptotic form for large mass or momentum is a wkb - type solution . ] .",
    "then , one ceases defining particle picture at intermediate time and treats mostly field observables like as the energy  momentum tensor and the charge current , which are renormalized by adiabatic regularization .",
    "for an electric background field , this approach has been used by kluger _",
    "_ @xcite .    in spite of these circumstances ,",
    "we apply the idea of instantaneous positive and negative frequency and investigate a particle number at each instant of time .",
    "that is because , for an electromagnetic background , @xmath113 falls off rapidly for high momentum if one take an appropriate electric field configuration ( see sec.[sec : nonste ] ) .",
    "[ in this section , @xmath113 does not fall off for high longitudinal momentum .",
    "it is not a defect of our method but a natural result since we take a constant electric field . ]",
    "thus , the application of the instantaneous positive and negative frequency to particle creation in an electromagnetic field can avoid the criticism subjected to cosmological particle creation .    of course",
    ", as noted earlier , a definition of particle in the presence of a pair - creating background is rather ambiguous .",
    "the use of the particle picture defined by the instantaneous positive and negative frequency solutions is merely an ansatz .",
    "an ansatz must be justified by physically reasonable results .",
    "actually the ansatz of the instantaneous particle picture will provide us with convincing behavior of distribution functions . especially in sec.[sec",
    ": nonste ] , we will get distributions which yield a finite total particle number .",
    "a merit of this particle picture is that the divergent part of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor can be removed only by normal ordering ; no further regularization is needed unlike the adiabatic approach .",
    "this good point benefits even those who do not trust the concept of particle number at each instant and accept only field observables .",
    "one can interpret defining a particle picture at each time as a means to identify zero - point energy .",
    "furthermore , energy conservation is automatically and manifestly guaranteed in this particle picture because the energy operator at each time takes the same form as that of the free field : @xmath228 , \\ ] ] and the bogoliubov transformation , which relates creation and annihilation operators of different times , conserves the commutation relation : @xmath229 this is not the case generally in the adiabatic approach , in which subtracted part is time - dependent . in this and next section ,",
