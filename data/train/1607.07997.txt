    "coherence is not only the essence of the interference phenomena but also the foundation of quantum theory [ 1 ] .",
    "it is almost directly or indirectly related to all the intriguing quantum phenomena .",
    "the most remarkable phenomena are quantum correlation including quantum entanglement .",
    "both can be understood as the combination of the coherence and the tensor product structure of state space and play important roles in quantum information processing tasks ( qipts ) [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "in addition , it is also shown that quantum coherence has been widely applied in quantum thermal engine [ 6,7 ] , biological system [ 8 ] and quantum parallelism [ 9 ] .    in quantum information , quantum feature such as entanglement [ 10 ] and quantum correlation [ 11 ] , due to the potential application in qipts , can be well quantified from the resource theory point of view . recently , in the same manner a rigorous framework has been developed for the quantification of quantum coherence [ 12 ] .",
    "it points out that a good coherence measure should satisfy three conditions : 1 ) the incoherent states have no coherence ; 2 ) ( monotonicity ) incoherent completely positive and trace preserving maps can not increase the coherence , or the average coherence is not increased under selective measurements ; 3 ) ( convexity ) it is not increased under the mixing of quantum states .",
    "meanwhile it also presented several good coherence measures .",
    "however , such coherence measures strongly depend on the choice of the basis .",
    "this means that a quantum state can have certain coherence in one basis , but it could possess more , less , or none coherence in the other basis . even though such a basis - dependent quantification of quantum coherence is consistent with our intuitive understanding ( such as the contribution of off diagonal entries of density matrix ) , this could only consider the partial contribution of coherence of a state , once one is allowed to freely select the basis . in particular",
    ", the change of basis is a quite easy thing or at a small price at practical scenarios . taking the linear optics for an example",
    ", one can only rotate the wave plate to get to another framework [ 13 ] . since quantum coherence",
    "can be understood as the useful resource , why not try one s best to extract it as many as possible ?",
    "so it is natural to consider , with all potential basis taken into account , how much coherence a state possesses or what is the maximal coherence in a state .    in this paper , we present the total coherence measure to quantify all the contributions of the quantum coherence in a state .",
    "the most distinct feature of this measure is that it only covers the property of a state instead of the external observable ( the choice of basis ) .",
    "we give several analytically calculable coherence measures in two different frameworks : optimization among all potential bases or quantifying the distance between the state and the incoherent state set .",
    "we find that all measures satisfy the mentioned three properties . in particular , one can find that the measure based on @xmath0 norm is also a valid candidate , even though the @xmath1 norm is not contractive .",
    "in addition , we find that the coherence measures based on relative entropy and the @xmath0 norm have the same result in the different frameworks . from the angle of the experimental detection , we give an explicit scheme to physically detect these measures .",
    "it is shown that such detections do not require reconstructing the full density matrix . as an application , we study the total coherence in the dqc1-like quantum probing schemes [ 14,15 ] including the qom [ 16 ] .",
    "as we know , dqc1-like quantum schemes show quantum speedup , but what the source of the speedup is remains open . here",
    "instead of finding the exact source , we study what cost is needed to pay for such schemes .",
    "it is found that both the normalized trace in dqc1 and the overlap of two states in qom can be well described by the change of the total coherence of the probing qubit . in other words",
    ", the nontrivial quantum probing always gives rise to the change of the total coherence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first propose various total coherence measures ; then we present the properties of these measures ; and then we study the total coherence in the dqc1-like quantum probing schemes ; finally , we give a summary and discussions .",
    "the classical coherence is usually characterized by the frequencies and the phases of different waves , but a good definition of quantum coherence stemming from the superposition of state ( a single wave ) depends not only on the state itself but also on the associated observable .",
    "the physical root of such a definition is that the measurement on the observable can reveal the interference pattern provided that the observable does not commute with the considered density matrix . in this sense , it is obvious that the coherence measure will have to depend on the framework ( or basis ) that the density matrix is given in [ 17,18 ] .",
    "therefore , there are naturally two ways to quantifying quantum coherence : one is based on the commutation , the other is based on the distance . based on the former , ref .",
    "[ 19 ] used the skew information to measure the coherence , and based on the latter , ref .",
    "[ 12 ] proposed several measures .",
    "we also used @xmath2 norm to study the source of quantum entanglement [ 20 ] . considering the potential classification of coherence of composite quantum system , we have provided a new angle to understand the geometric quantum discord , quantum non - locality and the monogamy of coherence [ 21 ] . here",
    "we shall consider the maximal coherence with different bases taken into account , or the total coherence which a state could have .",
    "therefore , a natural method to doing so is to maximize the basis - dependent coherence by taking into account all the potential bases .",
    "in addition , as mentioned before , the coherence can be embodied by the commutation between the state and some particular observable . since we consider all potential bases or ( observables ) , it is implied that the incoherent state requires that the density matrix should commute with all observables .",
    "the direct conclusion is that the incoherent state is the maximally mixed state @xmath3 with @xmath4 denoting the dimension of the state and @xmath5 denoting the @xmath4-dimensional unity .",
    "so one can easily construct the coherence measure based on the distance [ 9 ] . in the following",
    ", we will consider the coherence measures both by optimizing the basis and by the distance .",
    "* coherence based on basis optimization.*-with the different bases considered , we can define the total coherence based on the optimization of basis as follows.@xmath6where @xmath7 denotes the diagonal matrix and @xmath8 denotes some good norms or distance functions .",
    "for example , we can employ the @xmath2 norm , @xmath9 norm , relative entropy and so on .",
    "one can also use the trace norm and fidelity , but the incoherent state @xmath10 is usually not given by @xmath11 , but some particular states in the incoherent set [ 12 ] .",
    "the skew information can also be employed , but no explicit incoherent state is required . in order to provide an explicit expression of the total coherence , next we will list some coherence measures by the particular choice of the `` norms '' .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath9 norm could be the most easily calculable norm .",
    "but it is not contractive , so in many cases an unphysical result could appear [ 12 ] . in the current case , one will find in the paper that @xmath9 norm can be safely used to quantify the total coherence measure .",
    "based on @xmath9 norm , we have @xmath12the minimum can be reached because there always exists the basis @xmath13 such that the diagonal entries of @xmath14 are uniform .",
    "\\(2 ) if we employ the relative entropy [ 9 ] , the total coherence can be given by @xmath15with @xmath16 denoting the relative entropy of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the minimum is also achieved by the basis subject to the uniform distribution of the diagonal entries of @xmath14 .",
    "\\(3 ) based on skew information , we will have a different definition . the skew information [ 22 - 24 ] for a density matrix @xmath14 and an observable @xmath19 is given by @xmath20tr@xmath21 ^{2}$ ] . based on the skew information",
    ", the total coherence can be defined by@xmath22where @xmath23 is the eigenvalue of @xmath14 . in particular , one can find that the minimum can always be reached when in the basis @xmath24 the diagonal entries of @xmath25 are uniform .",
    "why @xmath26 can quantify the coherence can be easily found as follows .",
    "given a basis @xmath27 , @xmath14 can be diagonalized by the basis @xmath28 , iff @xmath29 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath30 . so the skew information in the basis @xmath27 can quantify the coherence of @xmath14 in this basis .",
    "considering all the potential basis , the maximal @xmath26 naturally quantifies the total coherence as mentioned above .",
    "this definition should be distinguished from that in ref . [",
    "19 ] where the coherence could depend on the eigenvalues of the observable .",
    "@xmath2 norm of a matrix is defined by the sum of the absolute values of all the entries of the matrix .",
    "it is also a good norm even though it is not a unitary - invariant norm . with this norm",
    ", the total coherence can be given by @xmath31 , with the maximum reached when all the diagonal entries of @xmath32 equal @xmath33 .",
    "however , because @xmath2 norm is not unitary - invariant , the optimal result of @xmath34 for a general @xmath17 ( especially in high dimensional hilbert space ) can not be easily given .",
    "but one can find that @xmath35 is unitary- invariant , because the optimization compensates for it .",
    "in addition , the explicit expressions of the total coherence based on trace norm and the fidelity can not be easily given because the nearest incoherent state can not be determined in general cases .",
    "* coherence based on distance.*-since the completely incoherent state is @xmath36 , one can always define the total coherence based on the distance between a given state and @xmath37 . using some ( unitary - invariant ) norms or distance functions @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 since no optimization is included , all the coherence measures can be easily calculated so long as one selects a proper function @xmath38 .",
    "for example , one can easily find the explicit form of the total coherence measure @xmath40 based on trace norm , fidelity and so on . here",
    ", we would like to emphasize the following several candidates .",
    "( @xmath41 ) if the relative entropy is used , one can find @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) if l@xmath44 norm is selected , we have @xmath45    it is obvious that the total coherence measures based on the relative entropy and the @xmath0 norm have the same final expressions in the different frameworks . because @xmath2 norm could be changed by a unitary operation , the coherence based on it has to take some optimization on the unitary transformations , that is , @xmath46 . here",
    "we would like to emphasize that our coherence measures actually are closely related to the purity .",
    "one knows that the purity of a state @xmath17 is defined by @xmath47 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath48 for pure states and @xmath49 for mixed state , based on which one can design many other similar quantities for purity such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 and so on .",
    "these purities reach maximum value for pure state and nonzero minimum value for maximally mixed states .",
    "thus the presented total coherence can be regarded as a displacement on the purity . in this sense , we give the purity a new understanding by the coherence and _",
    "vice versa_.    one should note that our coherence measures are defined different from the basis - dependent coherence , so the criteria for a good measure should be different either .",
    "next , we will list the useful properties that these measures satisfy , meanwhile they could form new criteria for a basis - independent coherence measure .",
    "in what follows , we will list several good properties that our above total coherence measures satisfy . in particular , we will show that the coherence measure based on @xmath0 norm is still a monotone , even though it is not a contractive norm .",
    "this could provide great convenience for the future applications .",
    "\\(i ) _ maximal for pure states and vanishing for incoherent states.- _ it is easy to find that all the coherence measures vanish for maximally mixed state @xmath36 and arrive at its maximal value for pure states .",
    "this can be well understood , since any pure state can be converted to a maximally coherent state by changing basis .",
    "( ii)__invariant under unitary operations.-__the most obvious feature , based on the definitions , is that all these measures are invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "( iii)_convexity.- _ all the measures are convex .",
    "that is , the total coherence will not increase under mixing .",
    "this can be found from the fact that all the norms satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "for the squared @xmath0 norm , one also needs to consider the convexity of the quadratic function .",
    "in addition , we know that the fidelity is strongly concave , the von neumann entropy is concave and the skew information is convex , so this property can be easily proved .",
    "( iv)_monotonicity.- _ this property will have different contents from that for the basis - dependent coherence measure .",
    "just as in entanglement theory and coherence measure [ 12 ] , the definitions of entanglement monotone and coherence monotone require the non - entangling operations and the basis - dependent incoherent operations , respectively .",
    "now let the incoherent operation be given in kraus representation as @xmath53 .",
    "if we follow the rules of non - entangling operations and the basis - dependent incoherent operations the elements of which can not generate entanglement or coherence , one can easily find that @xmath54 should be a unitary transformation neglecting a constant ( corresponding to probability ) .",
    "therefore , here the incoherent operations can be rewritten as @xmath55 .",
    "a simple algebra can show that the average total coherence equals the total coherence of the original state before the operation , but the total coherence of the final state after the operation will not be increased due to the convexity .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the coherence measure based on @xmath0 norm also satisfies this property , so it can be used safely .",
    "\\(v ) _ coherence does nt increase under the special povm.- _ this is another interesting property for the total coherence .",
    "let s consider such an operation that is given in kraus representation as @xmath56 .",
    "one can find that this operation can not create any coherence from the incoherent state @xmath36 , even though the single element such as @xmath54 may produce coherence .",
    "therefore , the average total coherence could be increased by @xmath57 .",
    "however , it is interesting that the total coherence of the final state ( the final ensemble generated by @xmath57 on the original state ) after this operation can not be increased .",
    "this conclusion may be drawn from the fact that all the above employed quantifications but @xmath9 norm are contractive .",
    "however , one can also prove that this property is satisfied for the case of @xmath9 norm . the proof is given as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the density matrix that we want to consider .",
    "the final state after the operation can be given by @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath59 , where we use the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath60 with @xmath61 denoting the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath23 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 . since @xmath64 , it is obvious that @xmath65 defines a positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) and @xmath66 which implies @xmath67_{ij}\\right\\vert ^{2}=\\sum_{im}\\left\\vert [ a_{m}]_{ij}\\right\\vert ^{2}=1 $ ] .",
    "expand @xmath68 , we will have @xmath69_{ij}\\right\\vert ^{2}\\lambda _ { i}\\lambda _ { j }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\leq & \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{i}\\lambda _ { i}^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2}\\left [ \\sum\\limits_{i}\\left ( \\sum_{jm}\\left\\vert [ a_{m}]_{ij}\\right\\vert ^{2}\\lambda _ { j}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\leq & \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{i}\\lambda _ { i}^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2}\\left [ \\sum\\limits_{ij}\\sum_{m}\\left\\vert [ a_{m}]_{ij}\\right\\vert ^{2}\\lambda _ { j}^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{i}\\lambda _ { i}^{2}=tr\\rho^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that the total coherence based on @xmath9 norm is not increased under the operation @xmath57 either .",
    "in the above sections , we mainly consider the mathematical approaches to measuring the total coherence .",
    "how can we directly measure the coherence experimentally ?",
    "in fact , one can note that the presented measures can be expressed by the function of the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath14 , for example , eqs .",
    "( 2,3,4,6,7 ) .",
    "since the eigenvalues of a density can be directly measured ( for example , the schemes for the measurable entanglement and discord [ 25 - 27 ] ) , our presented coherence can be naturally determined .",
    "however , for integrity and the latter use , we would like to briefly describe the concrete implementation .",
    "since @xmath70 for any @xmath71-dimensional density matrix @xmath14 , one can only set @xmath72 , respectively , and experimentally measure @xmath73 . in this way",
    ", we can get @xmath71 equations depending on the @xmath71 eigenvalues . in principle , all the eigenvalues can be determined by solving these equations . in order to do so , we can define the generalized swapping operator as @xmath74 . with the swapping operator one can find @xmath75 .",
    "thus one can first prepare a probing qubit @xmath76 and @xmath4 copies of measured state @xmath14 . then let the @xmath77 particles undergo a controlled @xmath78 gate , i.e. , @xmath79 with the probing qubit as the control qubit .",
    "finally , the @xmath80 measurement is performed on the probing qubit and the probability of obtaining @xmath81 will be @xmath82 which is as expected . the quantum circuit is shown in fig .",
    "hence , generally speaking , all the coherence measures can always be obtained by measuring @xmath83 @xmath78 with at most @xmath71 copies of the state @xmath14 . however , for the coherence measure based @xmath9 norm , one can find that the measurement scheme becomes quite simple , because it can be directly obtained by only measuring @xmath84 with only 2 copies of @xmath14 , which does not depend on the dimension of the measured density matrix .",
    "this is akin to the overlap measurement scheme [ 16 ] .    .",
    "for the quantum probing scheme , the initial state of the probing qubit is given by @xmath85 and the initial state @xmath86 is usually replaced by some density matrix @xmath87 . in dqc1 scheme , @xmath88 with @xmath89 . , width=188 ]",
    "here we consider the dqc1-like quantum probing schemes which include the above mentioned qom [ 16 ] and the remarkable dqc1 schemes [ 14,15 ] .",
    "the features of this kind of schemes are ( i ) a probing qubit is used to extract the information from the quantum system ; ( ii ) the cost of the probing does not depend on the probed quantum systems ( or the dimension of the input state space ) , once the system has been designed .",
    "the quantum circuit can be sketched as fig .",
    "1 , where a probing qubit is sent to the probed quantum system , and the interaction between the probing qubit and the system is usually provided by one or several controlled-@xmath90 operations . it is shown that there exists quantum speedup in the schemes [ 14,15 ] , but the essence of this speedup is neither entanglement nor discord between the probing qubit and the probed qubits [ 14,28,29 ] .",
    "most people could think that the coherence as the candidate should be an intuitive physics , but no quantitive description has been presented up to now . here",
    "we will do such a job by proving a weak result that nontrivial probing needs the existence of coherence .    for generality , we set the probing qubit to be given by @xmath91where @xmath92 is a real 3-dimensional vector with @xmath93 and @xmath94 denotes the vector made up of the 3 pauli matrices .",
    "suppose that the probed _",
    "n_-dimensional density matrix is denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "so the controlled-@xmath90 operation will lead to the final state as@xmath96with @xmath97 the hadamard gate .",
    "thus the final density matrix of the probing qubit becomes@xmath98 in order to guarantee that this probing scheme works , it is required that @xmath99 and @xmath100 do not vanish simultaneously .",
    "similarly , if we want to use @xmath90 operation to probe information of @xmath95 , @xmath90 should not be the identity .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq . (",
    "10 ) , one can easily obtain the total coherence based on l@xmath44 norm for @xmath101 and @xmath102 as@xmath103 .\\end{aligned}\\]]so the change of the total coherence can be given by@xmath104with the subscript @xmath90 denoting the change of the total coherence induced by the controlled-@xmath90 operation .",
    "thus @xmath105 is closely related to the evaluation of this quantum probing scheme . from the point of probing qubit of view",
    ", the cost of the probing qubit is that the total coherence changes @xmath105 for such a task .",
    "generally , if @xmath90 is an identity which means we do nothing in the scheme , one will see that @xmath106 .",
    "for the general dqc1 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 which is consistent with ref .",
    "for the qom where @xmath107 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , one can immediately find that @xmath113 which is directly given by the overlap of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , the above probing schemes maybe include more unitary operations denoted by @xmath116 ( here we mainly consider the controlled - u operations , and the unitary operations separately performed on the probing qubit and the probed quantum state . in particular , it is more reasonable to consider all the operations given by the basic quantum logic gates . ) .",
    "we would like to define the cost of such a scheme @xmath117 as the sum of the changes of the total coherence of the probing qubit .",
    "that is , @xmath118with @xmath119 taking all the unitary operations .",
    "in particular , one should note that @xmath120 for any @xmath119 based on eq .",
    "therefore , generally speaking , the more operations are used , the more cost is paid . in particular",
    ", @xmath121 will not vanish if the probing scheme only includes two unitary operations such as @xmath90 and @xmath122 .",
    "this should be distinguished from the scheme which only includes a single identity operation .",
    "this difference can be understood in the frame of basic logic gates . that is ,",
    "suppose @xmath90 and @xmath123 are given by a series of logic gates , the qubits through them will have to undergo the corresponding ` dynamical evolution ' , even though at the final moment the original state is recovered .",
    "on the contrary , a direct identity operation ( we mean no logic gates ) , no such an ` evolution ' is needed . in this sense , the subscript @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) taking all the covered logic gates could be more reasonable , but it will lead to more complicated calculations because how to construct a given operation by logic gates has to be considered .    finally , one can find that the coherence measures given by eqs .",
    "( 3,4 ) are described by the eigenvalues of the density matrix . in the above probing scheme",
    ", one can easily calculate that the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath102 are the functions of @xmath124 .",
    "hence we can always find what the cost @xmath121 is for the different measures which we can choose .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that @xmath121 is directly related to @xmath125 . to sum up",
    ", @xmath121 vanishes if and only if the probing scheme is trivial . in this sense",
    ", we think that @xmath121 can be understood as the cost of such a probing scheme .",
