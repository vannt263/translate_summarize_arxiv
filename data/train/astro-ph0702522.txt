    "the hi absorbing gas samples a larger volume than the oh , and different structural components may contribute to the hi and molecular absorption component",
    ". however , the central oh and hi velocity gradients of about 0.25 pc@xmath22 are surprisingly different from the velocity gradient of the co @xmath50 = 2@xmath101 emission of 0.74 pc@xmath22 .",
    "possibly the co data also samples the higher gradients of the gas in the two disks .",
    "the uniformly large line widths found in the hi and oh data confirm large - scale contributions to the central absorption .",
    "the large half - width values for hi and oh of 200 and 75 are consistent with the stellar velocity dispersion peaking at 270 close to the h@xmath9 and co @xmath50 = 2@xmath101 emission peaks ( see tecza et al",
    "the large zero - intensity line widths of hi and oh confirm the presence of a disturbed and rather clumpy medium with multiple structures in the central region including the two nuclei ( see also beswick et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the oh@xmath10hi optical depth ratio in the central region suggests an oh / hi abundance ratio of 8.6 x 10@xmath51 .",
    "this value is relatively high compared to other extragalactic absorption systems ( see baan et al .",
    "1985 ) , and would support the notion that the central region consists of enriched disk gas .      our data do not provide the detailed properties of the gas in the nuclear region and in the foreground .",
    "the hi and oh column densities suggest that the more obscured nucleus n1 lies behind the less obscured northern nucleus .",
    "the path to n1 would then sample a more complex multiple absorption structure ( see also beswick et al .",
    "2001 ) . the total hi column density at n1 of 1.28 x 10@xmath40 @xmath37 agrees with the column density estimated from x - ray nuclear emission ( komossa et al .",
    "in addition , the lower hi column at n2 of 1.01 x 10@xmath40 @xmath37 also agrees with the x - ray column . the ratio of ( integrated ) oh and hi optical depths ranges between 0.25 at n1 to 0.32 at n2 , which suggests lower enrichment at the nuclei relative to the central region .    both nuclei have agn characteristics in the radio and x - ray ( gallimore et al , ; beswick et al .",
    "2001 ; komossa et al .",
    "however , the extended radio continuum seen in the nuclear region forming the back - ground for the hi and oh absorption is associated with intense star - formation resulting from the close interaction of the galaxies ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; beswick et al . 2001 ) .",
    "extended radio structures of at least 1 kpc are commonly found in radio - quiet seyferts and liners that do not follow the morphology of a galactic disk ( gallimore et al .",
    "such extended structures result from nuclear outflows rather than starbursts and are likely to have a relatively luminous , compact radio source in the nucleus .",
    "although ngc6240 has evidence of a weak nuclear jet in the northern nucleus n2 ( gallimore & beswick 2004 ) , there is no evidence of strong agn - related activity that could explain the total emission region covering a projected 7 x 4 kpc region that does not include the arc structure .",
    "it is more plausible that the agns in n1 and n2 have recently become active as a result of the interaction , and that the extended radio emission is due to distributed star - formation and the symmetric outflow triggered by the star - formation .",
    "the distinct radio continuum region designated n3 is not necessarily a third nucleus , but is is rather an area of enhanced ( superposed ) star - formation region in the interaction zone of the two galaxies and is currently embedded in the extended radio structure in the north .",
    "the nuclei n1 and n2 are separated by 1.575 \" corresponding to 793 pc .",
    "if the interacting galaxies were in the plane of the sky , they would be at a very different velocity and the nuclear regions would be coalesced and extremely confused . since we see apparently distinct nuclear entities , they are more distant from each other and have only a projected distance of 793 pc . considering that the highest hi and molecular column densities lie in between the nuclei and that the x - ray source in n1 shows the highest column density , it is most plausible that n1 lies behind n2 .",
    "the small velocity difference suggests that the n1-n2 connecting axis has a small angle with the line - of - sight and the relative values of the velocities at n1 and n2 suggest that the galaxies are just past transit .",
    "the hi / oh systemic velocities at the nuclei can be used for a dynamical / orbital scenario for the nuclei projected on the sky .",
    "given the relatively large beam , we find an hi estimate of 7235 and 7305 and an oh estimate of 7255 and 7370 , which are nominally consistent with the higher resolution hi values of 7258 and 7440 ( beswick et al .",
    "these values are larger than the difference of stellar velocities of 50 ( tecza et al . 2000 ) , but consistent with the h@xmath9 ( @xmath52 150 ) , co(2@xmath101 ) ( @xmath52 100 ) , and bracket @xmath53 emission data ( lira et al .",
    "2002 ; ohyama et al 2000 ; tecza et al .",
    "we adopt the high - resolution hi estimate of the velocity difference for the nuclei @xmath54 = 182 .",
    "the projected distance @xmath55 of the connecting line between the two galaxies is 1.575 \" , which corresponds to a projected separation of 793 pc .    as an attempt at the dynamics of the close encounter , we assume a simple _ edge - on circular orbit for two equal masses m _ around the center of mass , and a ( small ) projection angle @xmath56 between our line of sight and the connecting line between the two nuclei .",
    "the description of the orbital motion of the system follows from : sin(@xmath56)@xmath57 = 0.031 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath55 , where m@xmath61 is the combined dynamic mass of the nuclear region .",
    "the estimate of tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of the stellar mass in each of the nuclei of about 2 x 10@xmath62 gives a combined dynamic mass of the nuclei of @xmath63 = 1.2 x 10@xmath64 using the smaller velocity difference .",
    "the central gas concentration also constitutes a significant fraction of the dynamic mass , such that @xmath65 @xmath52 ( 2@xmath104 ) x 10@xmath62 @xmath52 ( 0.3@xmath100.7 ) @xmath66 ( tacconi et al .",
    "for this reason , we adopt a dynamic mass for the nuclei of @xmath63 = 1.5 x 10@xmath64 , which results in @xmath56 = 13.4@xmath29 ( projection factor = 4.3 ) , an orbital velocity of 392 , and a distance between the nuclei of 3.42 kpc .",
    "the orbital period is about 27 myr .",
    "this scenario gives a sufficiently large separation distance to ensure identifiable nuclear / galaxy characteristics at this well - advanced stage just before coalescence .",
    "the oh and hi velocity field of the nuclear region is dominated by the large - scale organized motion of the accumulated gas structure .",
    "however , the detailed velocity pattern displayed in figures [ himom12]a and [ ohmom12]a suggest the presence of large - scale velocity components associated with the interaction of the two galaxies . the analysis of the stellar velocity field in the southern galaxy suggests a northwest - southeast rotation ( i = 60@xmath29 ) at pa = @xmath1034@xmath29 with @xmath67 = 270 @xmath42 90 ( tecza et al .",
    "the northern galaxy ( i = 33@xmath29 ) displays a southwest - northeast rotation at pa = 41@xmath29 with @xmath67 = 360 @xmath42 195 .    the hi and oh absorption in the northeast extension ( figs .",
    "[ himom12]a and [ ohmom12]a ) shows a southwest - northeast rotation for the northern galaxy at pa = 40@xmath1050@xmath29 with an hi gradient of 1.15 ( or 0.75 for oh ) pc@xmath22 north of n2 , which is consistent with a stellar gradient of 1.2 pc@xmath22 .",
    "however , the region south of n1 also shows evidence of a south - north rotation at 1.49 pc@xmath22 for hi and 0.75 pc@xmath22 for oh , and is associated with the large gas structure of the interaction .",
    "in addition , there is a weak low - velocity hi signature south of n1 down to 6900 with the southwest - northeast gradient of 0.89 pc@xmath22 , which could constitute the motion of the southern galaxy .",
    "the absence of a clear velocity signature of the southern galaxy could easily result from the column density around n1 .",
    "furthermore , the region west - south - west of n1 is very perturbed by the outflow and shows evidence of components with velocities up to 7750 .",
    "the continuum structure extends from n1 and n2 in all directions , including to the northwest region and the radio arc . the western radio arc results from the shocked regions forming the boundaries of a symmetric superwind - driven outflow emanating from n1 ( see heckman et al . 1990 ) , that is less prominent towards the east .",
    "in addition , there is a considerable extended radio emission resulting from distributed star - formation in the southwest and northeast regions . besides the presence of two agns ,",
    "the radio properties of the nuclear region suggest dominant starburst activity ( beswick et al .",
    "2001 ; gallimore & beswick 2004 ) .",
    "the k - band emission at both nuclei suggests a dominant population of red supergiants ( tecza et al .",
    "recent x - ray data suggest that the outflow was indeed symmetric and that there are remnants on both sides of the nuclei .",
    "the hi data shows a blue - shifted component along the line of sight extending to @xmath10300 with respect to n1 ( fig .",
    "[ hipvr ] ) .",
    "similarly there is a low velocity component in the oh data at @xmath10120 ( fig .",
    "[ ohpv ] ) , which produces a wing on the 1667 mhz line ( fig .",
    "[ ohspec ] ) . besides ohyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) note a @xmath10250 component in the h@xmath9 emission .",
    "these blue - shifted features could represent line - of - sight outflows and shocks , which are driven into the denser nuclear ism by the nuclear starburst and are associated with the superwind .",
    "the hi and oh velocity and linewidth data west - south - west of n1 as well as the blue - shifted hi components at n1 clearly confirm that n1 is the origin of the outflows .",
    "the lifetime of the starburst has been estimated at @xmath52 10 myr ( tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is about 40% of the orbital period of 27 myr derived above .",
    "the orbital motion may thus have resulted in smearing out the x - ray and radio emission regions .",
    "in addition , the difference of the emission strength of the northern and southern parts of the radio arc may also have resulted from the `` piling up '' of emission in the forward direction , which confirms that n1 is moving north .",
    "the complicated oh and hi structures southwest of n1 are associated with the outflow into the western cavity and cover a large velocity range , with a mean of about 100 below that of the systemic velocity of n1 .",
    "there is ( marginal ) evidence of hi absorption components west - south - west of n1 reaching an extreme of 7750 .",
    "our hi data also displays continuous absorption against the base of the northern radio arc and against arc components w0 , w2 and w4 .",
    "the hi absorption is found across much of the extended radio emission , while the oh is found only in the central region of the source .",
    "the hi absorption shows complicated structures with a wide range of velocities and line widths , and relatively low column densities .",
    "some of this material is associated with foreground dust lanes and ejected gas resulting from the interaction .",
    "the extended radio emission in ngc@xmath06240 is associated with the remnants of the two galaxies and the radio arcs resulting from the symmetric superwind outflows emanating from n1 and possibly n2 .",
    "as discussed above , we find significant absorption and an hi velocity gradient of 1.0 pc@xmath22 in the ne region , which is associated with the remnant of the northern galaxy .",
    "in addition , there is an east - to - west gradient towards the nw region ( at pa = -50@xmath29 ) , where we find the highest hi velocities in the system .",
    "the column density map of figure [ hicolumn ] displays widespread hi absorption in the large - scale structure of ngc@xmath06240 .",
    "discrete absorption components with column densities in the range of 0.4 - 1.0 x 10@xmath40 @xmath37 are found at the continuum component in the nw region and at the w0 , w2 , and w4 components of the arc structure .",
    "the velocities at these components , which are not associated with distinct components in the optical and h@xmath2 , suggest an increasing velocity towards the south .",
    "the dominant absorption at w0 is caused by a north - south dust - lane passing in the foreground of the continuum structure with an estimated column density of 3.2 x 10@xmath43 @xmath37 .",
    "images with various optical and x - ray instruments ( max et al . 2005 ; komossa et al .",
    "2003 ) show the clear presence of this north - south dust - lane that crosses the nw radio structure at w0 and accounts for an added column density .",
    "while the distributed hi in the nw region has a velocity of about 7500 , the dust - lane has a systemic velocity of about 7270 , which is close to that of n1 .",
    "furthermore , it has no clear velocity gradient because of its distance from the nuclei .    the radio continuum and x - ray images also display two extended structures s and sw of nucleus n1 ( see fig [ continuum]b ; komossa et al .",
    "it is found that a dust - lane structure towards the south divides these two structures .",
    "only weak absorption has been seen against the continuum in this southern region .",
    "a narrow h@xmath9o maser line has been detected towards the nuclear region of ngc@xmath06240 at vlsr = 7565 located within 3 pc from the continuum peak at n1 ( hagiwara et al .",
    "the occurrence of an h@xmath9o maser is rather unusual in a fir dominated galaxy such as ngc@xmath06240 , which is more likely an oh megamaser candidate .",
    "oh - mm ugc05101 also hosts a weak h@xmath9o maser towards the nuclear region ( zhang et al .",
    "the maser in ngc6240 is redshifted about 300 relative to the systemic velocity of n1 , while high - velocity oh or hi gas has only been found in the northern region of the source ( figs .",
    "[ hipvd ] , [ hipvr ] , and [ ohpv ] ) .",
    "an association of the maser with the agn could exist with shocked outflows , or jet - molecular cloud interactions in order to account for these discrepant velocities .",
    "examples of other redshifted jet - related masers can be found in the elliptical ngc1052 ( 100 - 180 ; claussen et al .",
    "1998 ) and mkn348 ( 130 ; peck et al 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , there could be either an association with infalling foreground gas to the nuclear region or with an active nucleus .",
    "the shallow and multi - component arecibo spectrum of oh in ngc@xmath06240 has been interpreted on the basis of partial infilling of the absorption by emission ( baan et al .",
    "the asymmetries in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ ohspec ] and the pv diagram fig .",
    "[ ohpv ] could indeed support this notion . while asymmetries suggest emission infilling at the velocity of n2",
    ", there is no evidence in the data for this .",
    "the bulk of the oh absorption shows an lte line ratio .",
    "only the western side of the central absorption shows non - lte ratios that suggest infilling with emission at the low - velocity side of the 1667 mhz line at the velocity of n1 .",
    "non - lte conditions could be caused by the fir radiation field , which is dominant in ngc6240 and has the right infrared colors for fir pumping as in oh megamasers ( baan 1989 ; henkel and wilson 1990 ) . while there would be enough background radio continuum for this purpose in the n1 system , there is no discernable line emission .",
    "the extended hi and oh absorption against the continuum structure has revealed more of the dynamic and evolutionary properties of the interacting system ngc6240 , and complementary evidence obtained at other wavelengths .",
    "the radio continuum structure and the associated absorption structure of ngc6240 is in part the result of a superposition of the two galaxies and their constituents . in a simple dynamic model using hi systemic velocities , the northern galaxy with nucleus n2",
    "would be located in front of the southern galaxy with nucleus n1 , such that the n1-n2 connecting line would be foreshortened by a factor of 4.3 . in this picture",
    "n1 would be expected to have the largest absorbing column density , while the central disks of the galaxies would be superposed between the two nuclei .",
    "the radio continuum structure of 15 `` x 17 '' ( 7.6 x 8.6 kpc ) peaks at the two nuclei of the interacting galaxies with hybrid starburst and agn emission , and is surrounded by an extended structure associated with star - formation activity triggered by the interaction .",
    "a large - scale but incomplete loop structure on the western side of the source has been associated with a nuclear blowout and outflow from nucleus n1 of the southern galaxy , while traces of a similar structure can also be found at the eastern side of the source .",
    "the hi absorption covers a contiguous 5 `` x 8 '' ( 2.7 x 4.2 kpc ) region of the continuum structure and provides a large - scale view of the velocity field across this area .",
    "the peak of the hi absorption falls close to nucleus n1 in such a way that the hi column density at n1 is 1.26 times that of n2 , and is in agreement with the estimates from x - ray observations .",
    "oh absorption has been found only against the nuclear continuum and extends 2.5 `` x 2.0 '' ( 1.25 x 1.0 kpc ) .",
    "the largest column density of the oh absorption falls north of n1 and about halfway between n1 and n2 , a fact that agrees with maps of other molecular emissions .",
    "the column densities at n1 and n2 are about 60% of that of the central gas structure .    the hi and oh velocity fields reveal parts of the velocity gradients of the two individual galaxies buried in the central region .",
    "velocity gradients at various locations suggest gas motions resulting from the interaction of the two galaxies .",
    "in particular , the location of n1 and the region to the west displays blue - shifted ( l.o.s . ) outflow components , as well as structural components related to the sideways outflow into the western bubble .",
    "this evidence clearly confirms the nuclear activity at n1 as the origin of the outflows and the cause of the radio arc , which is consistent with the evidence from x - ray and h@xmath2 data .",
    "distinct velocity components are found in the northern region and along the radio structure northwest of the nuclei .",
    "a foreground dust lane passes across the northwest radio loop structure .",
    "absorption in more distant continuum components do not reveal a coherent velocity pattern .",
    "the large width of the hi absorption line across the central part of the source confirms the violent dynamics of the system .",
    "the highest oh velocity widths are found at the central gas deposit , but they are significantly lower than those of hi and therefore less affected by the merger dynamics",
    ".    the central gas structure may result from a superposition of the disks of the two galaxies .",
    "there may also be accumulation of gas in the center of mass of the dynamic system .",
    "the central gas accumulation between the nuclei behaves as an independent structure with a velocity gradient proportional to the velocity difference of the two nuclei , and the gas appears locked into the motion of the system .",
    "the hi and oh velocity gradients for the central region are much smaller than that of co(2@xmath101 ) , which may suggest that different observations detect distinctly different scale sizes within these structures .",
    "the oh hyperfine ratio in the absorption region suggests mostly lte conditions across the nuclear region , except in the western part of the central gas accumulation where non - lte conditions are found .",
    "non - lte conditions may suggest that radiative far - infrared pumping actively reduces the absorption on the low - velocity side of the 1667 mhz oh line .",
    "no further oh maser emission has been found in the system .",
