    "the spatial confinement of electrons in qds suppresses the most efficient spin relaxation mechanisms @xcite and results in long spin coherence times @xcite .",
    "one of the most important parameters for the spin control is the @xmath0 factor , which characterizes the susceptibility of a spin to a magnetic field . in semiconductors , electrons are quasiparticles and their @xmath0 factor might be drastically different from the @xmath6 of a free electron .",
    "@xmath0 factors in qds have been measured either electrically @xcite or optically @xcite .",
    "the most widespread optical method is the measurement of the zeeman splitting in magnetoluminescence spectra which , in general , gives only the exciton @xmath0 factor @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases , reduced symmetry of the qds has allowed one to observe also the dark exciton states and separate electron and hole @xmath0 factor contributions @xcite .",
    "other optical methods of @xmath0 factor determination are spin noise spectroscopy @xcite and spin - flip raman scattering @xcite . especially high precision in the measurement can be achieved with optical pump - probe spectroscopy , where the @xmath0 factor is determined from the frequency of spin polarization oscillations in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "pump - probe spectroscopy allows one to determine separately the electron and hole @xmath0 factors as well as the @xmath0 factor spread , which contributes to the decay of the oscillations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin mode - locking effect in the pump - probe signal enables one to evaluate the spin coherence time @xmath7 and study the dynamics of the nuclear spin polarization @xcite .",
    "so far , electron and hole @xmath0 factors have been measured for qds emitting in the energy range @xmath8  ev . moreover , in pump - probe experiments , @xmath0 factors have been measured only for @xmath9  ev , the energies accessible by a ti : sapphire laser . however , an important energy range from a practical point of view is the telecommunication range which covers @xmath10  ev  @xmath11  0.95  ev ( @xmath12  @xmath4 m ) , corresponding to the transparency window of an optical fiber .",
    "furthermore , the spin dynamics in qds with low band - gap energies is of fundamental interest as it can be used to test the existing theories of @xmath0 factors in qds @xcite and stimulate the development of novel approaches , which in turn can help in refining band structure parameters . in particular , large in magnitude",
    ", negative electron @xmath0 factors are expected for small band - gap energies so that they may help to study and implement new robust spin interaction effects in qds @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we measure the electron and hole @xmath0 factors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for qds emitting around 0.8  ev ( 1.6  @xmath4 m ) by using the pump - probe faraday ellipticity ( analogous to the faraday rotation ) technique .",
    "the obtained electron and hole @xmath0 factors have the largest absolute values measured so far for iii - v qds by optical methods .",

    "we use a nt&c laser system consisting of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) pumped by a mode - locked yb : kgw laser operating at 1040  nm @xcite .",
    "the laser system generates a periodic train ( emission pulse frequency @xmath27 mhz ) of 300-fs - long pulses at a tunable wavelength of @xmath28  nm . by means of a pulse shaper , the broad ( @xmath29  nm )",

    "the laser output is split into pump and probe beams .",
    "the circular - polarized pump generates the carrier spin polarization whose temporal evolution is probed by measuring the ellipticity of the probe beam , which is initially linearly polarized , after transmission through the sample .",
    "this method is analogous to measuring the faraday rotation of the probe beam and provides similar information @xcite . in all experiments , except those where the pump power dependence of the signal strength is measured ,",
    "nearly @xmath30-pulse excitation power leading to maximal spin polarization is used .",
    "the population dynamics of the optically injected electron - hole pairs in the qds is investigated by measuring the differential transmission @xmath31 in a pump - probe experiment ( fig .",

    "linearly polarized pump pulses are used to excite a carrier population that was monitored by the polarized probe pulses as a function of delay relative to the pumps .",

    "[ figbdep](a ) .",
    "as we will show below , the fast and slow oscillations can be attributed to the electron and hole spin precessions , respectively .",
    "the dynamics are fitted by a form representing the sum of two oscillating functions of type @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the delay time , @xmath35 is the oscillation frequency , and @xmath36 is the spin dephasing time .",

    "the other possible source of the oscillation damping is fluctuations in the nuclear spin bath in the quantum dot @xcite .",
    "their contribution , however , shows up only for magnetic fields much weaker than the @xmath41 considered here .",
    "note that oscillations are observed only within the carrier lifetime ( @xmath42  ns ) which also limits the spin coherent signal in qds without resident carriers ( uncharged qds ) .",

    "the origin of the slow oscillations is less evident .",
    "it may be attributed to the hole spin precession .",
    "however , the measured value of @xmath44 is much larger than the transverse hole @xmath0 factor measured for annealed ( in , ga)as / gaas qds emitting around 1.4  ev ( @xmath56 ) @xcite .",
    "an other possible origin of the slow oscillations might be electron spin precession in the inp substrate or in the in@xmath1al@xmath2ga@xmath3as barriers which may be initiated through two - photon absorption .",

    "both amplitudes have a pronounced maximum , presumably corresponding to the pulse area of @xmath30 .",
    "the presence of a maximum in the dependencies indicates that the corresponding oscillations are related to the rabi oscillations in the qd excitation , while in bulk such oscillations are hard to observe due to the fast excitation induced dephasing for elevated excitation power .",
