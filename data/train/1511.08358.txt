    "the thermodynamic properties and the phase transition phenomena of various physical systems on two - dimensional non - euclidean surfaces have attracted the attention of many theorists and experimentalists for a couple of decades .",
    "especially , the studies of the hyperbolic surfaces , i.e. the negatively curved geometry , exhibit the increasing interest in theoretical research of quantum gravity , where the anti - de sitter ( ads ) hyperbolic spatial geometry plays its essential role .",
    "thus , the mutual interplay among condensed matter physics , the general theory of relativity , and conformal field theory ( cft ) enriches the interdisciplinary research  @xcite . among them , let us mention experiments on magnetic nanostructures  @xcite , soft materials of a conical geometry  @xcite , lattice dislocations of the solid - state crystals , quantum gravity  @xcite , and complex networks  @xcite , where neural networks with the non - euclidean geometry belong to as well .",
    "a typical theoretical example of such a hyperbolic surface geometry is a two - dimensional discretized hyperbolic lattice with a constant negative gaussian curvature .",
    "we consider an infinite set of such hyperbolic lattices constructed by the regular tessellation of congruent polygons , which are connected without empty spaces at the lattice sites ( the vertices ) with fixed coordination numbers .",
    "the hyperbolic lattices of finite sizes are known for their enormous number of the boundary sites .",
    "the number of the boundary sites is always larger than the remaining number of all the inner sites",
    ". or , equivalently , if one gradually increases the size of a hyperbolic lattice by regularly adding the outermost layers , the total number of the ( boundary ) sites increases exponentially with respect to the increasing radius of the lattice . since we also intend to determine the phase transitions of various multi - spin hamiltonians on the hyperbolic lattices , an accurate numerical algorithm has to be used , which is also capable of treating the models in the thermodynamic limit , where the perimeter of the lattice ( the size ) is infinite .",
    "such a condition makes the spin systems extremely difficult to be treated numerically on the hyperbolic lattice geometries ( in general , these systems are not integrable ) .",
    "therefore , the transfer matrix diagonalization methods are not numerically feasible ( due to a non - trivial way of the transfer matrix construction ) and the monte carlo simulations are not completely reliable ( due to the insufficiency of the finite - size scaling near phase transitions ) .",
    "we have recently proposed an algorithm  @xcite , which generalized the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) method  @xcite .",
    "so far , we applied the method to study ising - like systems on certain types of the hyperbolic lattices , where either the lattice coordination number was fixed letting the polygons to vary  @xcite or we fixed the polygons to be triangles and varied the coordination number  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we expand our earlier studies to multi - state spin hamiltonians on a much broader set of the hyperbolic lattices so that both the coordination number @xmath0 and the number of the sides @xmath1 in the polygons can vary .",
    "we describe a unique way of deriving generalized recurrence relations for such lattices by the ctmrg algorithm , which enable us to study phase transitions of the @xmath2-state clock and @xmath2-state potts spin models ( @xmath3 ) on any lattice geometries for arbitrary polygon number @xmath4 and for an independent coordination number @xmath5 .",
    "particular attention is focused on the analytic derivation of the free energy per spin site via the calculation of the normalized partition function by ctmrg .",
    "the free energy per site is a well - conditioned thermodynamic function , which does not diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the numerical calculation of the free energy by ctmrg reaches a high accuracy ; as it will be evident from singular behavior of the specific heat at a phase transition even after taking the second derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature numerically .",
    "( notice that monte carlo simulations are inefficient in evaluating the free energy due to large numerical fluctuations ) .",
    "the free - energy analysis has never been considered in any non - euclidean systems yet .",
    "hence , the current numerical analysis may serve as an appropriate , accurate , as well as complementary source of information for the non - integrable spin systems .",
    "the determination of the phase transition point can be derived , for instance , from the specific heat , which exhibits non - analytic behavior at a phase transition .",
    "the free energy naturally contains an important information , which reflects a rich boundary structure of the underlying lattice . in our previous studies",
    ", we mainly used to analyze single - site expectation values , such as the spontaneous magnetization ( measured in the lattice center only ) . in that case the boundary effects are always negligibly small , and the results are in full agreement with the known exact solution for the ising model on the bethe lattice . as we show later , having considered the boundary effects , the phase transition is completely suppressed and can be restored by an appropriate redefinition of the free energy .",
    "the correctness of the present numerical calculations is compared with the exact solutions of the phase transition in the ising model on various types of bethe lattices  @xcite .",
    "one can reverse the order of considerations and put another non - trivial question , which we intend to answer in the current study .",
    "the question is associated with a particular interest in the ads - cft correspondence , the so - called gauge duality  @xcite .",
    "a highly complicated boundary structure of a finite hyperbolic anti - de sitter space ( locally viewed as a minkovski - like space ) can be regarded as a spacetime for the conformal field theory ( being identical to a gravitational theory ) .",
    "our work is focused on the features of the complex boundary structures only , and no time evolution has been considered .",
    "a simple physical model with a spin - spin interaction network can be used to form a regular hyperbolic ( ads ) space , which can be analyzed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "so far , there has been neither theoretical nor numerical study aimed for the free - energy analysis of the ads spaces .",
    "however , we have succeeded and gradually developed a way of the free - energy analysis of such non - euclidean systems .",
    "a condensed - matter point of view on the ads - cft correspondence can undergo difficulties , one of them being the problem of a preferred coordinate system , i.e. , a lattice  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen an infinite set of two - dimensional curved hyperbolic surfaces ( ads spaces ) , where the underlying lattice geometry is not fixed at all , but can vary by changing two integer lattice parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we intend to investigate how the ( @xmath6 ) geometry impacts on the total free energy ( including the phase transitions ) so that the boundary effects are fully incorporated in the process .",
    "another question is related to a more concrete physical problem , where we consider an @xmath2-state spin hamiltonian defined on all possible infinite - sized lattice geometries ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the spin network is formed in such a way that we allow each multi - state spin to interact with @xmath0 nearest - neighboring spins only with a constant interaction coupling set to the unity .",
    "it results in hyperbolic geometries of various gaussian curvatures .",
    "the free - energy study of the multi - state spin systems for the classical spin system can be also generalized to the ground - state energy study for the quantum spin system , as we mention later .",
    "we also answer the question , of which of the ( @xmath6 ) lattice geometries can minimize the free energy per site .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly define the regular ( @xmath6 ) lattice geometries . in the sec .",
    "ii a. , the multi - state spin clock and potts hamiltonians are defined .",
    "a concise graphical representation of the recurrence relations is derived in the sec .",
    "ii b ( this part can be skipped as it explains an algorithmic structure of the corner transfer tensors in details ) . having derived the recurrence relations , we check the correctness of the ctmrg algorithm in sec .",
    "iii by calculating the phase transitions of the simple ising model on sequences of selected ( @xmath6 ) lattices .",
    "the entire sec .",
    "iii can be also skipped since it is devoted to comparing numerical accuracy of the developed algorithm at phase transitions with the exactly solvable cases on the bethe lattices .",
    "the analytic derivation of the free energy per site , which is the core of this study , is given in sec .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "v , where the phase transitions of the multi - state spin models on the ( @xmath6 ) lattice geometries are analyzed by the free energy per site and the related specific heat .",
    "the concept of the _ bulk _ free energy is defined in order to extract the correct information on the phase transition , provided that the boundaries effects are suppressed .",
    "the two - dimensional surface profiles of the free energy with respect to the geometry parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 are calculated .",
    "the main purpose is to study relations between the surface profiles of the free energy and the radius of the gaussian curvature in the asymptotic ( @xmath6 ) limit .",
    "we observe that the free energy per site can asymptotically reflects the geometrical structure of the spin - spin interactions being associated with the underlying lattice geometry .",
    "moreover , we show that the phase transition temperatures can also copy the ( @xmath6 ) lattice geometry as the free energy does . in sec .  vi we discuss our results .",
    "the idea of replacing the standard transfer matrix formulation of classical spin systems by the alternative corner transfer matrix method originates in baxter s proposal of treating spin hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "the reformulation of baxter s analytical study into the numerical ctmrg algorithm was first performed by nishino and okunishi  @xcite , who combined the corner transfer matrix formalism with the numerically effective density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "the ctmrg algorithm was generalized and applied to the ising model on the pentagonal hyperbolic lattice with the constant coordination number four  @xcite .",
    "the essence of the ctmrg algorithm rests in finding the recurrence relations , which are used for the extension of the corner transfer matrices .",
    "before we propose a unified ctmrg algorithm for any classical spin system on the hyperbolic lattice surfaces , we describe the lattice geometry that is gradually built up by polygons .",
    "let the lattice be made by the regular polygonal tessellation with the constant coordination number .",
    "each lattice geometry is characterized by the schlfli symbol ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath1 is associated with the regular polygon of @xmath1 sides ( the @xmath1-gon in the following ) with the constant coordination number @xmath0 .",
    "there are three possible scenarios of creating the lattice geometry ( @xmath6 ) for the integers @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "( 1 ) the condition @xmath9 gives rise to the two - dimensional euclidean flat geometry . in this study",
    ", we consider only the square lattice ( @xmath10 ) , which satisfies the condition , and the remaining triangular ( @xmath11 ) and honeycomb ( @xmath12 ) euclidean lattices will be studied elsewhere .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath13 , the infinite set of the hyperbolic geometries can satisfy the condition .",
    "although such lattices of infinite size define various two - dimensional curved surfaces , the entire infinite hyperbolic lattice can be spanned in the infinite - dimensional space only ; it it commonly associated with the hausdorff dimension , which is infinite .",
    "none of the hyperbolic lattices can be endowed in the three - dimensional space .",
    "( 3 ) the condition @xmath14 corresponds to only five finite - sized spherically curved geometries , which are trivial and are not considered in the current study .",
    "each vertex of the infinite ( @xmath6 ) lattice , built up by the @xmath1-gons with the fixed coordination number @xmath0 , represents a classical multi - spin variable @xmath15 interacting with the @xmath0 nearest - neighboring spins .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 can be decomposed into the sum of identical local hamiltonians @xmath17 acting exclusively on the local @xmath1-gons , which are considered to be the basic elements in the construction of the entire lattice .",
    "in particular , the decomposition of the full hamiltonian is @xmath18,\\ ] ] where the sum is taken through the given lattice geometry ( @xmath6 ) accordingly .",

    "we consider two types of the multi - state spin models : the @xmath2-state clock model with the local hamiltonian @xmath23 = -j\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{p } \\cos\\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{m}(\\sigma_{i}-\\sigma_{i+1})\\right]\\ ] ] and the @xmath2-state potts model @xmath23 = -j\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{p } \\delta_{\\sigma_{i},\\sigma_{i+1}}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 within the @xmath1-gon , and where each @xmath2-state spin variables @xmath25 .",

    "dimensionless units are used by setting @xmath31 . in general",
    ", the ising model on the hyperbolic lattices ( @xmath6 ) is not exactly solvable , except for special asymptotic cases , on the bethe lattices ( when @xmath32 ) , as discussed and numerically checked in sec .",
    "we employ the generalized ctmrg algorithm as a powerful numerical tool to study the phase transitions on the arbitrary lattice geometries ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the ctmrg algorithm is an rg - based iterative numerical method , which makes it possible to evaluate the partition function @xmath33 and the thermodynamic functions within high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "let each ctmrg iteration step be enumerated by an integer variable @xmath34 .",
    "at the very beginning of the iterative process , the lattice size of the ( @xmath6 ) geometry is as small as the size of @xmath0 connected @xmath1-gons around a single central spin , and is referred to as the first iteration step with @xmath35 . in the second iteration step , @xmath36 , the lattice can expand its size , i.e. the number of the spin sites , either as a power law [ only for the euclidean ( @xmath10 ) lattice ] or the size grows exponentially [ for all the remaining ( @xmath6 ) hyperbolic cases ] .",
    "the lattice size increases with respect to the number of the boltzmann weights ( or , equivalently , with respect to the total number of the spin sites ) .",
