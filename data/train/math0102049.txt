    "let @xmath3 be a hyperbolic knot .",
    "we have been developing machinery which parlays a little information about such a knot into a rather thorough understanding of its @xmath1 character variety as well as a classification of its finite and cyclic fillings . as an example of our method",
    ", we will examine the case where @xmath4 is the @xmath0 pretzel knot ( see figure  [ fg334 ] ) .",
    "there are three types of input necessary for our approach .    1 .   a listing of the boundary slopes of the knot .",
    "for example hatcher and oertel  @xcite have discussed how to determine the boundary slopes of any montesinos knot .",
    "2 .   information about @xmath5 ,",
    "the two - fold branched cyclic cover of the knot .",
    "again , montesinos knots are good candidates in this regard as @xmath5 is then a seifert fibred manifold .",
    "at least one non - trivial finite , cyclic , or small seifert surgery .    given this data",
    ", we can generally determine the number of components of the @xmath1 character variety of the knot as well as the culler - shalen seminorms on each component .",
    "this allows us to classify all finite and cyclic surgeries on the knot .",
    "part of our motivation in presenting this work is to solicit examples of other knots meeting our input criteria .",
    "our algorithm has been successfully applied to the twist knots  @xcite and the @xmath6 pretzel knots  @xcite .",
    "the twist knots are montesinos knots which each admit three small seifert surgeries and are therefore amenable to our methods .",
    "the @xmath1 character variety of a twist knot consists of two algebraic curves and these knots admit no non - trivial finite or cyclic surgeries . as for the @xmath6 pretzel knots ,",
    "since they each have two small seifert surgeries , we can use our techniques to show that the character variety consists of two or three curves and that there are only five non - trivial finite surgeries .",
    "that is , the @xmath7 pretzel has three non - trivial finite surgeries , the @xmath8 has two non - trivial finite surgeries and the remaining hyperbolic @xmath6 pretzel knots admit no non - trivial finite or cyclic surgeries .    to illustrate our methods",
    ", we will look at the @xmath0 pretzel knot which has a small seifert surgery of slope 1 . our intention is to give an overview of the main ideas of our approach . for a more careful account",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "our main tool is the culler - shalen seminorm which we now briefly describe",
    ". a more detailed exposition can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) or @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of @xmath1-representations of the fundamental group @xmath10 of @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 is an affine algebraic set , as is @xmath13 , the set of characters of representations in @xmath12 . since @xmath14 is small  @xcite , the irreducible components of @xmath13 are curves  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.4 ) .",
    "moreover , for each component @xmath15 of @xmath12 which contains an irreducible representation , the corresponding curve @xmath16 induces a non - zero seminorm @xmath17 on @xmath18  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* propositon 5.7 ) via the following construction .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "define the regular function @xmath20 by @xmath21 . by the hurewicz isomorphism",
    ", a class @xmath22 determines an element of @xmath23 , and therefore an element of @xmath10 well - defined up to conjugacy .",
    "the function @xmath24 is again regular and so can be pulled back to @xmath25 , the smooth projective variety birationally equivalent to @xmath16 . for @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the degree of @xmath28 the seminorm is extended to @xmath29 by linearity .",
    "we will call a seminorm constructed in this manner a culler - shalen seminorm .",
    "if no @xmath30 is constant on @xmath16 , then @xmath17 is in fact a norm and we shall refer to @xmath16 as a _ norm curve_. if @xmath16 is not a norm curve , then there is a boundary slope @xmath31 such that @xmath32 is constant on @xmath16 . in this case , we will call @xmath16 an _ @xmath31-curve_.",
    "the minimal norm @xmath33 is an even integer , as is @xmath34 , the sum being taken over the curves @xmath35 .",
    "our goal is to show that the character variety of the @xmath0 pretzel knot has one norm curve and one @xmath31-curve with @xmath36 .",
    "as the reducible characters also form a curve , this means @xmath13 consists of exactly three algebraic curves .",
    "we will present the argument by discussing how each of the three inputs mentioned in the introduction come into play .",
    "as the @xmath0 pretzel knot is a montesinos knot , @xmath5 is a seifert fibred space .",
    "the base orbifold @xmath37 of @xmath5 is @xmath38 with cone points of order @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we can use this information to determine @xmath41 .",
    "essentially , the argument relies on the strong connections between the various fundamental groups . to wit ,",
    "let @xmath42 be the index two subgroup of @xmath10 corresponding to the two - fold cyclic cover .",
    "then @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the class of a meridian of @xmath4 . also , @xmath46 @xmath47 is a triangle group and isomorphic to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the center .",
    "now , by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.1.4 ) , @xmath50 for each curve @xmath35 .",
    "so @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the degree of zero of the function at the point @xmath53 . to evaluate the sum ,",
    "we are led to look at zeroes of @xmath54 which are not zeroes of @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 . in other words , the representations which kill @xmath58 , and therefore factor through @xmath59 ,",
    "will all contribute to the sum .",
    "the abelian @xmath1-representations of @xmath59 lift to ( binary ) dihedral representations of @xmath10 .",
    "the number of @xmath1-characters of these dihedral representations may be related to the alexander polynomial @xmath60 ( * ? ? ? * theorem 10 ) and there are ( @xmath61 ) 4 such @xmath1 characters",
    ".    on the other hand , non - abelian representations will factor through the center of @xmath59 to become representations of @xmath62 .",
    "in general , the number of @xmath63-characters of @xmath64 is ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.2 ) ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath67 .",
    "this count includes the reducible characters . as the character of a reducible representation is also the character of an abelian representation , we see that the reducible characters correspond to representations of @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "so the number of reducible @xmath63-characters of @xmath64 is @xmath71    in particular , @xmath62 admits @xmath72 irreducible @xmath63 characters and therefore @xmath73 irreducible @xmath1 characters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.5 ) .    by (",
    "* theorem a ) , each of the dihedral and triangle group characters contributes two to @xmath41 so that @xmath74 .",
    "according to @xcite , the boundary slopes of @xmath4 are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . a small rearrangement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.2 ) shows that @xmath78 the sum being taken over the boundary slopes @xmath79 . here",

    "in particular , using standard meridian - longitude coordinates , we can denote @xmath81 ( respectively @xmath82 ) as @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) @xmath85",
    ". then @xmath86 .",
    "thus , given a list of boundary slopes , finding the culler - shalen seminorm comes down to solving a system of equations for the non - negative integers @xmath87 . to fix the ordering in what follows ,",
    "let @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in order to solve equation  [ eqgi ] , we will need to know about at least one non - trivial cyclic , finite , or small seifert filling @xmath91 , as @xmath92 may then be related to @xmath93 .    *",
    "if @xmath91 is a cyclic surgery , then @xmath94 ( * ? ?",

    "if @xmath91 is a finite surgery , then @xmath95 ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) . *",
    "if @xmath91 is small seifert then @xmath96 , the filling along @xmath91 , is seifert fibred .",
    "the base orbifold will be @xmath38 with cone points of order @xmath97 and @xmath31 . in this case , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a constant depending on @xmath97 and @xmath31 ( an example of this type follows ) .    for the @xmath0 pretzel knot ,",
    "@xmath100 filling is seifert fibred with base orbifold @xmath101 .",
    "then the @xmath73 irreducible @xmath63-characters of @xmath102 ( see equations  [ eqpqr ] and [ eqh1 ] ) become @xmath103 @xmath1-characters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.5 ) each contributing @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( * ? ? ? * theorem a ) .",
    "thus @xmath106 ( summing over the curves @xmath35 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath107 .",
    "of course @xmath50 since @xmath108 is a cyclic filling .",
    "so we have the equations @xmath109 ( where we ve suppressed the ` @xmath110 ' sub- and superscripts ) .",
    "subtracting , we find @xmath111    let us first investigate the case where @xmath112 is a norm curve . in order to have a norm ( rather than just a seminorm ) , at least two of the @xmath113 must be non - zero .",
    "equation  [ eq331 ] shows that @xmath114 on a norm curve .",
    "on the other hand , from equation  [ eq333 ] we see that @xmath115 implies @xmath116 which would not be possible for a norm curve .",
    "therefore @xmath117 .",
    "then equation  [ eq333 ] implies @xmath118 .",
    "finally , equation  [ eq331 ] allows us to bound @xmath119 : @xmath120 .",
    "in particular , on a norm curve , we have @xmath121 .",
    "this means there can be at most one norm curve .",
    "( if there were two or more , @xmath122 contradicting an earlier equation . ) on the other hand , the component @xmath123 of the character variety containing the character corresponding to the holonomy representation _ is _ a norm curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath124 denote the norm on @xmath123 .    since @xmath125",
    ", we see that @xmath126 for any @xmath31-curves . on the other hand , on an @xmath31-curve @xmath16 , @xmath127 and @xmath31 is a boundary slope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.4 ) .",
    "so the only candidate is @xmath36 .",
    "now @xmath128 , with @xmath129 seifert fibred over @xmath130 and @xmath131 seifert over @xmath132 , is a graph manifold and its @xmath63 representations will factor through @xmath133 . since the @xmath63-character variety @xmath134 contains exactly one curve (",
    "* example 3.2 ) , the same is true of @xmath135 and we conclude that there is a unique @xmath31-curve @xmath136 with @xmath36",
    ". moreover the minimal norm is @xmath137 .",
    "( for a more detailed account of this argument , see the discussion of the @xmath138 filling of the @xmath6 pretzel knot in @xcite . )",
    "thus @xmath13 contains one norm curve @xmath123 and one @xmath31-curve @xmath136 .",
    "the culler - shalen seminorm on @xmath136 is @xmath139 while that of @xmath123 is @xmath140}\\ ] ] ( i.e.  we choose @xmath141 so that @xmath142 ) .",
    "the polygon @xmath143 of radius @xmath144 in @xmath124 is illustrated in figure  [ fgb ] .",
    "notice that @xmath143 lies below the line @xmath145 . since any finite or cyclic surgeries would have norm at most @xmath146 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) , we see that @xmath4 admits no other cyclic or finite surgeries beyond trivial surgery along the meridian @xmath147 .",
    "( delman  @xcite has already shown that this knot has no non - trivial finite surgeries using completely different methods . )",
    "the newton polygon of the @xmath148 polynomial is dual to @xmath143 @xcite and is illustrated in figure  [ fgn ] .",
    "we now generalize to the @xmath2 pretzel knot which we will denote by @xmath149 .",
    "note that @xmath150 is the mirror reflection of @xmath149 , so we can assume @xmath151 .",
    "this family includes some knots we have investigated elsewhere : @xmath152 is a twist knot @xcite and @xmath153 is the reflection of the @xmath154 pretzel knot @xcite . since @xmath155 is not prime , it s not hyperbolic and therefore not amenable to the techniques we have been discussing . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath156 , @xmath149 is hyperbolic .",
    "moreover these knots have a seifert surgery at slope @xmath157 .",
    "( we have verified this for @xmath158 using the montesinos trick .",
    "for @xmath159 we have only the evidence of snappea  @xcite . )",
    "so for these knots we have the required inputs in order to apply our machinery and work out the culler - shalen seminorms .",
    "but what of @xmath160 ?",
    "why stop at @xmath161 ?",
    "we are obliged to stop since we have no evidence of @xmath149 admitting a seifert filling for @xmath162 .",
    "indeed , the seifert surgeries occur according to a very nice pattern . by @xcite ,",
    "the boundary slopes of @xmath149 are @xmath163 , @xmath76 and @xmath164 . for @xmath165 , the seifert surgeries lie between the boundary slopes @xmath76 and @xmath164 as the following table illustrates .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the boundary slope",
    "@xmath164 moves across the integers toward @xmath76 , those integers cease to be available for seifert surgeries .",
    "for example , when @xmath162 , the boundary slope is @xmath166 and there are no more seifert surgeries .",
    "i should emphasize that this is based on experimental evidence .",
    "these knots may admit other seifert surgeries beyond those i ve listed in the table .",
    "in addition , although i ( or others ) have shown that all the other surgeries in the table are seifert , the only evidence i have in the @xmath159 case comes from snappea  @xcite . nonetheless , it is a curious pattern and it would be nice to understand this phenomenon .    thus we can only hope to apply our machinery to @xmath149 when @xmath167 .",
    "the first two cases are treated elsewhere and @xmath168 was discussed in detail above . for @xmath169",
    "our method breaks down as the equations corresponding to equations  [ eq331 ] , [ eq332 ] and [ eq333 ] above do nt result in a unique solution for the @xmath87 s .",
    "since @xmath170 is not strongly invertible , we can not use the montesinos trick to work out the indices for the seifert surgery of slope @xmath100 . without that information",
    ", we can not complete the analysis of that knot .",
    "however , @xmath171 is tractable . for this knot",
    "we have the same conclusions as for @xmath172 : there s one norm curve with @xmath173 and @xmath174},\\ ] ] and one @xmath31-curve with @xmath36 and @xmath137 .",
    "this means that @xmath171 also admits no non - trivial cyclic or finite surgeries .",
    "( again , delman  @xcite had shown this previously using different methods . )",
    "i would like to thank steve boyer for many useful conversations and in particular for suggesting that other pretzel knots might have seifert fillings .",
