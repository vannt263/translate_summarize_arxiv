    "the two - center problem is well known in classical celestial mechanics : two fixed centers , with masses  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , attract some `` massless '' particle , moving in their field according to newton s law .",
    "the integrability of this problem was proved by euler , by means of the separation of variables  @xcite .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the plane two - center problem was offered by c.charlier  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) ; a qualitative analysis of the spatial two - center problem can be found in the paper by v.m.alekseev  @xcite .",
    "note also that it was lagrange who observed that the two - center problem remains integrable upon addition of the potential of an elastic spring attached to the midpoint of the rectilinear segment connecting both centers .",
    "lagrange also studied the limiting case of the problem , where one of the two - centers and its mass tend to infinity . in the limit",
    "we have the problem of a point subject to the superposition of the field of a newtonian center ( the kepler problem ) and a homogeneous field .",
    "the corresponding separation of variables and a qualitative study of this problem was done by m.born in his book on atomic mechanics  @xcite , in connection with the splitting of a hydrogen atom s spectral lines observed when it is put into an electric field ( the stark effect ) .",
    "a more general two - dimensional integrable system , which incorporates the two - center problem , was found by g.darboux  ( 1901 )  @xcite , by means of the method of the separation of variables . in this paper darboux also obtained the existence conditions for an additional quadratic integral in case of a natural system on a plane .",
    "later , these conditions were described by whittaker  @xcite .",
    "consider a particle of unit mass , moving on  @xmath2 in the potential field @xmath3 where @xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and  @xmath6 are the real distances between  @xmath7 and the two identical real centers positioned at the points  @xmath8 , @xmath9 on the abscissa axis , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the distance between  @xmath7 and the origin  @xmath13 ; @xmath14 and  @xmath15 are the `` complex distances '' between  @xmath7 and the two imaginary centers  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( see fig .  1 ) .    for the potential   to be real ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath20 and  @xmath21 are complex conjugate : @xmath22 . as is shown in  @xcite , if  @xmath23 , the system   allows the separation of variables in elliptic coordinates @xmath24 and has an additional first integral , which is quadratic in the momenta .",
    "let us examine some special cases of the potential  .",
    "the case of  @xmath25 was studied by g.liouville ( a more special case of @xmath26 was , as we already mentioned , described by lagrange ) .",
    "it was shown in the paper  @xcite that the problem of a particle moving in the field of two complex conjugate centers , i.e. , when  @xmath27 in  , is integrable in the three - dimensional space and makes a good approximation to the problem of a satellite s motion in the field of an oblate spheroid ( eg . , the motion of an artificial satellite of the earth ) .    in the paper by i.s.kozlov  @xcite ,",
    "the problem of the plane motion of a particle in the field of four fixed centers ( two real and two complex ) was integrated in terms of quadratures and further studied .",
    "besides , in  @xcite , several interpretations of this problem were offered , with reference to actual problems of applied celestial mechanics .",
    "systematic generalization of various problems from classical and celestial mechanics to constant curvature spaces ( a three - dimensional sphere  @xmath28 , as well as a pseudo - sphere  @xmath29 , or lobachevsky space ) was done by w.killing in his extensive , but , unfortunately , almost forgotten paper  @xcite .    note also that beside killing , in the  19th century , non - euclidean mechanics in constant curvature spaces was studied by r.lipschitz , f.schering and h.liebmann . it is interesting that though a whole chapter from liebmann s textbook on non - euclidean geometry  @xcite concerned the generalization of newton s law of attraction , study of the kepler problem , and reformulation of kepler s laws for the cases of a sphere and a pseudosphere , similar results were independently and almost simultaneously rediscovered in the 20th century by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the classical paper by e.schrdinger  @xcite should also be mentioned , where he studied a quantum analog of the kepler problem in a curved space , implicitly assuming that the corresponding classical problem was integrable .",
    "an analogue of newton s law of attraction for  @xmath29 was known to j.bolyai , and  n.i.lobachevsky , and for  @xmath28   to p.serret .",
    "w.killing in  @xcite studied , among other things , the problems of @xmath30-dimensional dynamics in constant curvature spaces , including the dynamics of an  @xmath30-dimensional rigid body .",
    "an up - to - date analysis can be found in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the generalization of the two - center problem to constant curvature spaces is also due to w.killing , who integrated this problem , using the method of the separation of variables .",
    "it was independently solved in  @xcite , where a more general problem was studied , similarly to what lagrange did by introducing an elastic interaction potential in the plane two - center problem . in the papers",
    "@xcite , a bifurcational analysis of the two - center problem on a sphere and on the lobachevsky plane was offered . in  @xcite we examined the spatial two - center problem from the standpoint of its reduction and integrability",
    "; we also studied other integrable and non - integrable problems of celestial mechanics in curved spaces ( including the restricted two- and three - body problems , behaviour of libration points , dynamics of rigid bodies ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will offer an explicit algebraic expression for the first integral of the generalized two - center problem from  @xcite , and show a new analogue of the problem of four newtonian centers and  @xmath30 hookian centers . in this paper",
    ", we study only the case of a two - dimensional sphere  @xmath31 , though all the reasoning can easily be extended to a pseudosphere  @xmath32 .",
    "certain ( not all ) results are generalized to a three - dimensional sphere  @xmath28 ( or a pseudosphere  @xmath29 ) .",
    "assume that a unit sphere  @xmath31 is given in the three - dimensional space  @xmath33 by  @xmath34 and denote by  @xmath35 , @xmath36 the redundant coordinates and momenta , respectively .",
    "now if we introduce the angular momentum vector  @xmath37 and put  @xmath38 , it is easy to show  @xcite that the equations of motion in an arbitrary potential  @xmath39 can be presented as a hamiltonian system with the poisson bracket defined by the algebra  @xmath40 : @xmath41 and the hamiltonian @xmath42 from  , we obtain the equations @xmath43 which coincide with the equations of motion of a spherical top in the potential  @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the bracket is degenerate and has two casimir functions :  @xmath45 , @xmath46 . for the problem of a point moving on a sphere , it is necessary that  @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known that the analogues of the newtonian and hookian potentials on  @xmath31 are , respectively ,  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where  @xmath51 is measured from a certain fixed pole on the sphere  @xcite .",
    "consider the potential @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the intensities of the newtonian centers , while  @xmath55 is the angle between the radius - vector of a particle and the radius - vector of the  @xmath56-th center .",
    "place the newtonian centers at the points  @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and add to  , for the sake of generality , the potentials of three hookian centers located at the mutually perpendicular axes  @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . we should also introduce the quadratic potential  @xmath62 @xmath63 , which is a special case of neumann s potential . on the level  @xmath64 we find two commuting functions  @xmath65 , quadratic in  @xmath66  @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and the functions  @xmath74 , @xmath75 are : @xmath76 the function  @xmath77 is the hamiltonian , and  @xmath78 is an additional quadratic integral . as it is noted in  @xcite , the integrability of the corresponding three - dimensional ( @xmath28 ) problem closely depends on whether a hookian center ( with potential  @xmath79 ) can be added ( at some point of the arc joining the newtonian centers ) to the two - center problem   without violating the problem s integrability .",
    "indeed , the term  @xmath79 , @xmath80 appears in the three - dimensional case as a result of the routh reduction procedure , which uses the cyclic integral .",
    "this integral is due to the equations invariance under rotations ( group  @xmath81 ) , in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the two centers .",
    "the system is of the liouville type and can be integrated in sphero - conical coordinates  @xmath82 , @xmath83 , ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) given by @xmath86 note , however , that obtaining the integrals in the algebraic form is quite a non - trivial problem , as its solution implies dealing with an inverse sphero - conical transformation .",
    "as a.albouy informed us , the two - center problem on  @xmath31 ( or  @xmath32 ) can be transformed to the traditional euler problem of two centers by means of the central ( gnomonic ) projection and a suitable transformation of time .",
    "however , we can not yet prove this statement .",
    "consider the potential on a sphere : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this potential corresponds to the two - center problem on sphere .",
    "the intensities of the centers are `` complex '' and the centers themselves are equidistant ( complex conjugate ) from the pole ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for the potential to be real , it is necessary that  @xmath90 . as in the euclidean case , the potential",
    "can be regarded as a certain approximation to the problem of a particle moving in the field of an oblate spheroid in a curved space .",
    "the system with the potential is also separable in the sphero - conical coordinates  , provided that @xmath91    in the coordinates , the potential  @xmath92 is also separable . this potential ( for  @xmath93 ) corresponds to the problem of four fixed centers , two imaginary and two real , which belong to two mutually perpendicular planes through the pole ( see fig .  2 ) . here , as in the planar case ,",
    "when the distance between the real centers is fixed , the distance between the complex centers is also not arbitrary : it is uniquely defined by  .",
    "it is easy to show that the potentials @xmath94 can be added ( without violating integrability ) to the four centers problem and it results in a more general system , separable in the coordinates  .",
    "the potentials  @xmath95 written in terms of the variables   look like : @xmath96 one can easily show that in the limit  @xmath97 ( the case of euclidean plane ) the total potential  @xmath98 becomes the darboux potential  .",
    "note that this potential , or even  @xmath92 , can no longer be generalized to the corresponding integrable potential of the three - dimensional problem ( @xmath28 ) , because there is no cyclic integral , though , taken individually , the potentials  @xmath99 and  @xmath100 allow such a generalization .",
    "let us present one more integrable modification of the problem of a mass point moving in the field of the hookian potentials  @xmath101 , @xmath61 , where the hookian centers of attraction  @xmath102 , @xmath103 do not belong to mutually orthogonal axes , but are placed arbitrarily on an equator  @xcite ( fig .",
    "when @xmath104 , the hamiltonian and the additional integral are @xmath105 there is an arbitrary function  @xmath106 in  .",
    "this function means addition of an arbitrary `` central '' field with the center on a perpendicular to the plane of the hookian potentials ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for example",
    ", one more hookian center can be placed at the pole .",
    "this implies ( see  @xcite ) that the spatial problem of a point moving on a three dimensional sphere  @xmath28 under the action of  @xmath30 hookian centers on its equator is also integrable .",
    "note that a euclidean analogue of the problem in question is trivial , as even in cartesian coordinates it yields  @xmath30 linear oscillators . in this case",
    ", the hookian centers can be arbitrarily scattered in  @xmath107 . in the case of curved space , even on a two - dimensional sphere , the problem of motion in the field of three arbitrarily placed hookian centers is not integrable , as simulations reveal chaos in this system .",
    "the quadratic integral  @xmath78 in   is due to the fact that the problem is separable in the spherical coordinates  @xmath108 .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian  @xmath77 can be written as @xmath109 + u(\\theta),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath110 are the coordinates of the moving mass point , while  @xmath111 defines the position of the  @xmath56-th hookian center on the equator ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the expression in square brackets is an additional integral of motion  .",
