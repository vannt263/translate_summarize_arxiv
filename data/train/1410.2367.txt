    "one easily verifies that the dicke state of @xmath0 qubits with @xmath232 excitations has the following bipartite correlations : @xmath234 the correlations of an anti - dicke state , with @xmath233 excitations , are the same due to the symmetry @xmath235 of these correlations .",

    "for arbitrary superposition @xmath236 the correlations read : @xmath237 since applying @xmath238 with @xmath239 to the dicke states does not change the parity of their excitations , the last two terms vanish , and for the first two terms we have @xmath240 . therefore , an arbitrary superposition of dicke and anti - dicke states has the same correlations as in ( [ d - dbar ] ) and therefore none of such superposed states is bi - product .",
    "since the dicke states are invariant under exchange of parties ( and so are their superpositions ) , the same holds for other partitions .",
