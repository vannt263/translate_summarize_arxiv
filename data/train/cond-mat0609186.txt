    "for simplicity , we introduce a basis set given by @xmath190 by using this , we represent the relation  ( [ eq : opt_mid ] ) in a simpler form : @xmath176 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&(|\\overline{n_1,n_2}\\rangle - |\\overline{n_2,n_1}\\rangle).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements of @xmath65 are calculated as follows : @xmath191 for @xmath192 , @xmath193 for @xmath194 , @xmath195 for @xmath196 , and @xmath197 equations  ( [ eq : midgap_11 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : midgap_12 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : midgap_13 ] ) , and ( [ eq : midgap_14 ] ) show several characteristics of the local excitations included in the midgap states .",
    "for example , the local states @xmath118 and @xmath198 move in the system with the larger transfer integral @xmath199 while the states @xmath200 and @xmath201 move with the smaller transfer integral @xmath202 ( see fig .  [",

    "the terms containing @xmath203 mean that a collision between the light `` particle '' and the heavy `` particle '' creates @xmath203 .",
    "it is also found that the state @xmath203 splits into a pair of the light `` particle '' and the heavy `` particle '' .",
    "here we note that the following boundary conditions should be used : @xmath204.,width=264 ]    the effective hamiltonian derived here is difficult to diagonalize analytically .",

    "the spectral intensity of @xmath211 is obtained by the summation of those of the degenerate states .",
    "the higher - order effect would lift the degeneracy for @xmath211 . some of thus split states must be optically active .",
    "as for the spectral intensity , the perturbative results are good only in the vicinity of @xmath74 .",

    "we have studied the properties of the photoexcited states in the 1d dimerized hubbard model coupled with the lattice .",
    "a notable point of our conclusion is that the lowest photoexcited state in this model is the interdimer ct state .",
    "it is true that this point is inconsistent with the experimental result for k - tcnq , where the lowest - energy peak in @xmath36 of k - tcnq has dominant spectral intensity .",
    "@xcite this experimental fact implies that the lowest photoexcited state is an intradimer ct state , as the authors pointed out .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy would be due to the finite nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , often denoted by @xmath213 , of k - tcnq .",
    "the intradimer ct state could lower its energy by the effective attractive interaction @xmath213 between the holon and the doublon .",
    "this is because , in the intradimer ct state , the mean distance between them is smaller than that in the interdimer ct state .",

    "[ fig : opt_for_ktcnq ]",
    ".    however , in the experiments of the photoinduced inverse spin - peierls transition , the excitation energy so far corresponds to the energy of the interdimer ct state rather than that of the lowest - energy intradimer ct state .",
    "@xcite in this sense , the experimental result is consistent with our conclusion that the interdimer ct state destabilizes the dimerized phase , leading to the inverse spin - peierls transition .",
    "our assumption that the realized state after the photoexcitation is the interdimer ct state is justified in discussing the photoinduced dynamics observed so far .",
    "if an experiment were performed in which the energy of the pulsed laser is lowered to coincide with the excitation energy of the lowest - energy intradimer ct state , the dimerization would be only weakly reduced and the following lattice dynamics would reflect the local character of the intradimer ct state , which is quite different from the character of the interdimer ct states .",
    "the photoconductivity experiment of k - tcnq also supports our conclusion on the photoexcited state .",
    "the experimental results shown in fig.2 ( a ) of ref .",
    "reveal the conducting nature of the photoexcited state . with the free - carrier - like charged dimer states",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath215 , the interdimer ct state is the best candidate for the photoexcited state .",
    "by contrast the intradimer ct state has an exciton - like bound state that does not have the conducting nature .",
    "this situation would remain unchanged for finite @xmath213 systems",
    ".    here we will give a comment on another way to describe the photoexcited states of the 1d dimerized mott insulators .",
    "it is the odd ( or even ) ct state proposed in ref .  .",
    "since the dimerization occurs , a ct state with even parity at @xmath40 becomes optically active acquiring a small spectral weight .",
    "@xcite this description is valid for small-@xmath8 systems .",
    "it is a complementary approach to our treatment .",
    "for example , the interdimer ct state adiabatically connects to the lowest photoexcited state of the uniform system , which corresponds to the odd ct state .",
    "both the interdimer and intradimer ct states are linear combinations of the odd and even ct states . as @xmath8 increases , the degree of hybridization changes continuously .",
    "hence , our discussion from the decoupling limit , which allows us a relatively simple analytical treatment , is helpful to understand the optical excitations of the present system .",
    "another conclusion of our study is on the origin of the midgap state observed just after the photoexcitation .",
    "our calculation has clarified that the midgap states correspond to both the intradimer and interdimer ct excitations from @xmath43 . here",
    "we note that the degeneracy between @xmath203 and @xmath216 or @xmath217 would be lifted for finite @xmath213 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_for_ktcnq ] ) .",
    "then the peaks might be split into two parts . in any case , a dominant spectral weight belongs to the intradimer ct excitation due to the large transfer integral , not to the interdimer ct excitation .",
    "therefore the observed midgap state in k - tcnq would be due to the intradimer ct excitation from the photoexcited state @xmath43 .",
    "here we discuss another possibility that the experimentally observed midgap state is not caused by the purely electronic mechanism .",
    "then the most probable candidate for the midgap state would be a polaron where a photodoped carrier is coupled with phonons via electron - lattice couplings .",
    "in fact , okamoto et al . have found that the photoinduced phenomena in k - tcnq are affected by lattice oscillations due to three relevant phonon modes .",
    "@xcite however , it seems inappropriate to explain the midgap state by those phonon modes .",
    "the lowest energy ( 20@xmath218 ) phonon mode has a too - long oscillation period , and the other higher - energy modes decay much faster than the midgap state ( which decays in about 3ps ) . in this paper , we have provided an idea only on the generation of the midgap state , taking account of its ultrafast development .",
    "it is a challenging problem to discuss why the midgap state has a relatively long decay time ( 3ps ) , although it is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "a possible scenario is that the midgap state caused by the purely electronic mechanism couples with slowly decaying phonon modes , such as the 20@xmath218 mode .     and ( b ) finite @xmath213.,width=264 ]    the authors are grateful to prof .",
