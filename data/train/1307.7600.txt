    "we are interested in the problem of what happens when a set of nominally identical liquid water droplets are cooled at some rate , until they freeze .",
    "it is observed @xcite that the droplets do not all freeze at the same temperature ; they freeze over a broad range of temperatures .",
    "we want to understand this , and make predictions about this phenomenon , using a simple model .",
    "to do this , we define the probability @xmath3 that a randomly selected droplet has _ not _ frozen , at the time when we have cooled it down to a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath3 is a cumulative probability , the probability that a sample freezes between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , is @xmath5 . in an experiment ,",
    "@xmath3 can be approximated by the fraction of a large number of identically prepared droplets that are still liquid at a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "levine s model @xcite for the freezing of liquid water droplets is simple .",
    "he made the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "each droplet contains impurities that have a total of @xmath0 nucleation sites .",
    "2 .   each nucleation site induces nucleation of ice rapidly at a well defined temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this temperature @xmath1 varies from one nucleation site to another .",
    "the sites are independent , and the values of @xmath1 are drawn from a probability distribution function @xmath6 .",
    "4 .   only one nucleation event is required to induce crystallisation of the droplet , and so the droplet crystallises at the highest @xmath1 of its @xmath0 nucleation sites .",
    "we denote this maximum value of a set of @xmath0 @xmath1 s , by @xmath2 .",
    "assumption 4 allows us to use extreme - value statistics , see @xcite for an introduction to these statistics .",
    "here we define a singular model as being a model in which assumptions 1 to 4 are made .",
    "in particular , assumption 2 eliminates any time dependence , giving us a model with only a temperature dependence .",
    "this definition of a singular model agrees with that of pruppacher and klett @xcite .",
    "levine then made a fifth assumption :    1 .",
    "the distribution of nucleation temperatures at the sites , @xmath7 , is exponential , i.e. , @xmath8    this distribution has two parameters : @xmath9 ( dimensionless ) and @xmath10 ( dimensions of temperature ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 controls how rapidly the probability of finding a site with a given @xmath1 , decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "note that levine wrote this distribution in a rather different way .",
    "see appendix a for a comparison to his work that uses notation that is closer to levine s .",
    "it is worth noting that we are only interested in the highest value of @xmath1 of a large number of sites , and so only the large @xmath1 tail of the distribution @xmath7 is relevant here .",
    "the form of @xmath7 around average @xmath1 values is irrelevant .",
    "the maximum is never in this region .",
    "thus we need only assume that the large @xmath1 tail of the distribution is exponential",
    ". the distribution around average values can be anything as these sites do not affect freezing and so have no effect in experiment . because of this eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) is only the high-@xmath11 tail and so is not normalised .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 controls the location of this tail , i.e. , the bigger @xmath9 is , the larger the number of sites with high nucleation temperatures .    also , note that we expect @xmath0 to scale with the total surface area of the impurities present in a droplet .",
    "so if impurities are deliberately added , as for example @xcite and @xcite did , then @xmath0 should be proportional to the amount added .",
    "when the impurities are those naturally present in the water , then if their concentration is constant , their amount and hence @xmath0 will be proportional to the droplet volume .    as an aside , we note that in the language of the statistical physics of quenched disorder , levine s model has quenched disorder , but no annealed disorder .",
    "the quenched disorder is the variability in the temperatures at which nucleation occurs on the sites .",
    "it is _ quenched _ disorder as it is assumed not to depend on time , but to be fixed for a given droplet .",
    "there is no annealed disorder as there is no time dependence .",
    "annealed disorder is associated with dynamic fluctuations , which are neglected in singular models .",
    "if we make all 5 assumptions of section [ section : levine ] , we can easily derive the gumbel distribution for the freezing temperature , @xmath2 .",
    "the derivation of levine s distribution of freezing temperatures proceeds as follows .",
    "we start by obtaining the cumulative probability distribution function for a nucleation site , @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 is the probability that the nucleation temperature at a nucleation site is _ lower _ than @xmath1 .",
    "the cumulative probability @xmath12 is just a definite integral over @xmath7 , so using the exponential @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) , we have @xmath13 where we used eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) for @xmath7 , and we extended the upper limit on integration from @xmath14c to infinity .",
    "of course , @xmath7 must be zero for temperatures above @xmath14c , and so the approximate @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) is only valid for values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that the exponential @xmath7 is negligible for @xmath15c .",
    "we assume this to be the case here .    if a droplet contains @xmath0 nucleation sites then the probability that it is in the liquid phase , @xmath3 , is simply the probability that _ all _ @xmath0 nucleation sites have crystallisation temperatures below @xmath2 .",
    "we are assuming that even a single nucleation site will cause freezing .",

    "the assumption that nucleation occurs at a site at a precisely determined temperature , @xmath1 , is presumably only an approximation to the truth .",
    "if ice nucleation in a droplet occurs at a temperature - dependent stochastic rate , @xmath84 , then nucleation will occur over a temperature range of some width @xmath85 .",
    "this width is expected to scale as @xmath86 the expression in brackets is the ratio of the temperature derivative of the rate , to the rate itself .",

    "note that it is non - negligible assumption that a well - defined nucleation rate exists in these systems @xcite .    in words , the expected spread in nucleation temperatures , @xmath85 due to a temperature - dependent nucleation rate ,",
    "is approximately equal to the temperature change needed to double the nucleation rate .",
    "this temperature change is evaluated when the nucleation rate equals the cooling rate .",
    "the singular limit is then the limit @xmath89 .",

    "then what we are plotting is directly proportional to the cumulative probability of finding a nucleation site with a nucleation temperature above @xmath2 .",
    "this may aid in interpreting data for @xmath3 .",
    "microscopic models of nucleation , for example those based on classical nucleation theory , are also used to fit and understand experimental results @xcite .",

    "however , in the singular limit ( @xmath92 ) almost any microscopic model will give the gev .",
    "thus in this limit any two microscopic models with similar @xmath12 will be essentially equivalent .",
    "finally , in practice if data deviates from the gev , it may be difficult to assess why , as there could be several reasons for the deviations .",
    "these include : 1 ) effects of a stochastic temperature - dependent rate , of the type that classical nucleation theory predicts ; 2 ) a complex @xmath7 due to a mixture of surfaces , all making significant contributions to nucleation ; 3 ) non - classical - nucleation - theory time - dependent processes , for example , irreversible chemical processes at surfaces that change the ability of a surface to promote ice nucleation ; ( 4 ) each droplet contains only a handful of impurity particles with the nucleation sites , and so some droplets have many more nucleation sites ( @xmath0 ) than others .",
    "distinguishing between the four may be difficult , although varying the cooling rate may be one way to eliminate at least some of them .      it may be worthwhile to do what is standard practice in other fields where extreme - value statistics are used , and to fit the gev distribution to the data . here",
    "the data is the fraction of droplets that have frozen , as a function of temperature .",
    "if the fit is good , then the data would be consistent with an extreme - value model , and if the fitted @xmath51 is close to zero , it would suggest that the high @xmath11 tail of the nucleation temperatures of individual sites is indeed exponential or similar , i.e. , decays faster than a power law @xcite .",
    "however , a value of @xmath53 suggests a power law decay for @xmath7 , while @xmath54 suggests an upper limit beyond which @xmath93 . in other words ,",
    "the value of @xmath51 gives information on the form of @xmath7 .",
    "another point of view , is that assumptions 1 to 4 ( only ) , lead to the gev , and so the gev can be used to decouple assumptions 1 to 4 , from assumption 5 .",
    "assumptions 1 to 4 are presumably only approximately true .",
    "in particular , assumption 2 that a site induces nucleation at a temperature independent of cooling rate is presumably only approximate . to rigorously test for violations of this assumption , which is at the heart of singular models",
    ", we would like to avoid assumption 5 , and so should tests for deviations from the gev , not from the gumbel distribution .",
    "a final point to note is that the high-@xmath11 tail in @xmath7 , not only determines @xmath94 , but also determines the scaling of the median nucleation temperature with @xmath0 . in general , the fatter the tail in @xmath7 , the faster the median nucleation temperature varies with @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ n_scale](a ) .",
    "so if a fit to a @xmath94 produces a @xmath53 then the volume dependence should be faster than logarithmic , the median freezing temperature should scale as @xmath95 .",
    "a best fit value of @xmath54 suggests a weibull distribution , which has an upper cutoff and hence an upper limit to the median nucleation temperature as droplet volume is increased .",
    "levine s approximation for the probability that nucleation has not occurred at a temperature @xmath11 is the first factor in his eq .  ( 2 ) . we write this as @xmath96 where we have taken the dominant term in his exponent , @xmath97 , and changed what is a @xmath98 in levine s expression to a @xmath99 .",
    "levine uses the absolute value of @xmath11 in celsius , so his @xmath11 is our @xmath99 . in this expression @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the volume of a droplet , and @xmath102 is a large reservoir volume , @xmath103 .",
    "the droplet volume @xmath101 is proportional to our @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath104 is is analogous to our @xmath9 parameter .",
    "the @xmath105 parameter controls the width of levine s distribution , so it is analogous to our @xmath10 .    if we note that both @xmath29 and @xmath106 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ levine1 ] ) as an exponential @xmath107 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp\\left[-\\exp\\left[-t\\ln r+\\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{\\mu}\\right)\\right]\\right ] \\label{levine2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we compare this equation with eq .",
    "( [ gumbel_exp ] ) , we see that they are the same if @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . also , from this equation it is easy to show that the median nucleation temperature , @xmath33 , scales as @xmath110 .",
    "levine s eq .",
    "( 2 ) is actually his approximation for the probability density , @xmath38 , that nucleation has occurred at a temperature @xmath11 not the cumulative probability that it has not occurred down to a temperature @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath111 .",
    "the expression in levine s eq .  2 is not quite the @xmath11 derivative of eq .",
    "( [ levine2 ] ) , as levine treats @xmath11 as a discrete variable when it is a continuous variable .",
    "thus the expression in his eq .",
    "( 2 ) is , for this reason , approximate . but this should not obscure the fact that levine was the first to realise that the extremes of the distribution of nucleation sites determine the nucleation behaviour , and that the use of what is essentially extreme - value statistics can be used to model freezing behaviour .",

    "<S> models without an explicit time dependence , called singular models , are widely used for fitting the distribution of temperatures at which water droplets freeze . in 1950 </S>",
    "<S> levine developed the original singular model . </S>",
    "<S> his key assumption was that each droplet contained many nucleation sites , and that freezing occurred due to the nucleation site with the highest freezing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that freezing occurs due to the maximum value out of large number of nucleation temperatures , means that we can apply the results of what is called extreme - value statistics . </S>",
    "<S> this is the statistics of the extreme , i.e. , maximum or minimum , value of a large number of random variables . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the results of extreme - value statistics to show that we can generalise levine s model to produce the most general singular model possible . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when a singular model is a good approximation , the distribution of freezing temperatures should always be given by what is called the generalised extreme - value distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also show that the distribution of freezing temperatures for droplets of one size , can be used to make predictions for the scaling of the median nucleation temperature with droplet size , and vice versa .    </S>",
    "<S> the freezing of water droplets in the earth s atmosphere is an important and longstanding problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we want to understand how the water droplets freeze , and be able to predict quantitatively the conditions where the droplets do and do not freeze . </S>",
    "<S> to do this we of course need good experimental data , but we also need models with few enough parameters that their values can be reliably obtained by fitting to experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> these models should make as few assumptions as possible , and we should as clear as possible as to what these assumptions are . </S>",
    "<S> an innovative early attempt at developing such a model was that of levine in 1950 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> levine assumed that water droplets freeze due to highly variable impurities in the droplets . </S>",
    "<S> he then introduced a simple statistical model of these impurities , and hence of the freezing behaviour @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> levine s model has no direct time dependence . instead of an explicit rate </S>",
    "<S> , nucleation is assumed to occur at a particular nucleation site as soon as it is cooled to a temperature characteristic of that site . </S>",
    "<S> levine s work has inspired a literature on what are often called @xcite singular  models @xcite . by definition </S>",
    "<S> singular models are models that lack direct time dependence . </S>",
    "<S> as far as i know , levine s is the first such singular model . </S>",
    "<S> he did not call his model singular , that name originates with @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> singular models can be contrasted with what are called stochastic  models where there is an explicit nucleation rate for a stochastic process of nucleation , and so a direct time dependence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> levine assumed that each droplet has a large number of nucleation sites , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> he called these sites motes . </S>",
    "<S> he assumed that each mote had a different nucleation temperature , @xmath1 , and that the droplet froze at the highest of these @xmath0 nucleation temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this second assumption means that , within his model , the freezing temperature of a droplet , @xmath2 , is a random number that is the maximum of a number of independent random numbers . </S>",
    "<S> although levine apparently did not realise this , this means that what he was doing was an example of what is called extreme - value statistics . </S>",
    "<S> this is the statistics of the extreme ( maximum or minimum ) of a large number of random variables . </S>",
    "<S> see the books of either @xcite , or @xcite , for an introduction to extreme - value statistics . incidentally , back in the 1950s , turnbull realised that levine was effectively doing extreme - value statistics @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we use results from modern extreme - value statistics to show that the results obtained by levine can be written in slightly simpler forms , and that they can be generalised  one of his assumptions was not necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the expression derived by levine , his eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , is in fact almost ( see appendix a ) the probability density function of the gumbel distribution of extreme - value statistics . if nucleation is indeed occurring on the nucleation site with the highest nucleation temperature , then the fraction crystallised should have the form of what is called the generalised extreme value ( gev ) distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for almost all distributions of the site nucleation temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the gumbel distribution is a special case of the gev distribution . </S>",
    "<S> levine also derived a logarithmic dependence of the mode droplet freezing temperature on droplet size . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this scaling is less general than the gumbel distribution .      </S>",
    "<S> our motivation for this work is that levine s key assumptions are very reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions are that a droplet has a large number of nucleation sites , and that nucleation occurs on the one with the highest nucleation temperature . also , the neglect of time dependence , although an approximation , simplifies the model , meaning that the model has very few parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a model with few parameters is useful , as typically fitting a model with more than two or three parameters to experimental data is difficult to justify . </S>",
    "<S> the data may not adequately constrain the values of a larger number of parameters .    thus levine </S>",
    "<S> s model seems a very attractive simple model that can be used to fit data directly , and can be built on to make more sophisticated models . </S>",
    "<S> for both these reasons it seems worthwhile to use results in modern extreme - value statistics to generalise it to produce the most general singular model possible , and to determine the minimal assumptions required for it to apply .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will describe levine s model , and then show how his key results may be derived using modern extreme - value statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we will then generalise levine s model to produce the most general possible singular model of the type that levine introduced . in our final section , </S>",
    "<S> we suggest how this could be used to model experimental data . </S>"
