    "precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies such as those obtained by the wmap satellite @xcite provide valuable information on the very early universe . any theoretical model that attempts to explain the evolution of the universe before the big bang nucleosynthesis will also have to explain the observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "the power spectrum of these primordial anisotropies is nearly scale invariant @xcite and it contains almost all the information on primordial perturbations .",
    "however , a small amount of non - gaussianity is still allowed by the data @xcite . the information contained in this non - gaussian component will contribute to a huge advance in our understanding of the very early universe . for example",
    ", the simplest and most popular inflationary model based on a single field with a canonical kinetic term satisfying slow - roll conditions and standard initial conditions predicts that the level of primordial non - gaussianit is actually unobservably small @xcite , even with future cmb experiments like the planck satellite @xcite .    recently however , there are some hints of non - gaussianity @xcite in the cmb anisotropies .",
    "these are one ( or so ) standard deviation hints but they motivate tremendous efforts from the theoretical cosmology community to create inflationary models that can produce large levels of non - gaussianity both seen in the bispectrum and in the trispectrum . in the literature , there is a myriad @xcite of models that can produce sizeable non - gaussianity .",
    "they basically relax one ( or more ) of the following conditions : single field , slow - roll , standard kinetic energy and standard initial conditions .    in the present work",
    ", we will consider a single field model with a non - canonical kinetic term .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this kind of models predicts large bispectrum and also large trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "in particular the dbi - inflation model @xcite , which is constructed within string theory , is such an example . for current and stringent observational constraints and consequences of dbi - inflation",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will focus our attention on the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "the current observational bound @xcite on the trispectrum is rather weak @xmath0 , where @xmath1 parameterizes the size of the trispectrum , but in the near future with the planck satellite it will improve to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we should note that these bounds depend on the shape of the trispectrum @xcite and the values quoted here can be applied only for local models of non - gaussianity . thus it is important to calculate the exact form of the trispectrum in the dbi - inflation model and construct an estimator to measure the trispectrum of the cmb anisotropies .",

    "@xcite , computed the graviton exchange trispectrum and they showed that the above conclusion does not change , i.e. the total non - linearity parameter @xmath1 coming from both the contact interaction and the graviton exchange trispectrum is still unobservably small and of order @xmath4 .",
    "also recently , gao and hu @xcite computed the leading order trispectrum from entropy perturbations in multifield dbi - inflation model .    in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the authors computed the trispectrum at leading order in slow - roll and in the small sound speed limit for a fairly general inflationary model , where the inflaton s lagrangian is a general function of the scalar field and its first derivatives .",
    "they only calculated the contact interaction trispectrum and they argue that for certain models ( dbi - inflation inclusive ) the trispectrum can reach values in the observable range of the planck satellite .    in the present work , we will calculate the scalar exchange trispectrum for the same model . we will show that the scalar exchange trispectrum is of the same importance as the contact interaction trispectrum .",
    "this completes the work of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and gives the final answer that should be constrained when comparing the trispectrum for models with large non - gaussianity with observations .",

    "in the configuration where all the momentum vectors have equal magnitude , i.e. the equilateral configuration , the variable @xmath127 defined as the sum of the arguments of the @xmath123 functions vanishes for the terms in ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) that contain a @xmath123 function with three negative arguments . because @xmath127 appears in the denominator of some fractions in the definitions of @xmath123 one might naively think that the trispectrum ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) diverges for these configurations .",
    "we will now show that when considering all the 23 permutations in ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) , the powers of @xmath127 that appear in the denominator in the different terms cancel out and we are left with expressions that are clearly finite in the limit @xmath127 going to zero .",
    "the proof is rather simple if one notes that the apparently divergent terms ( @xmath123 functions with three negative arguments ) can be gathered in certain combinations that are clearly finite in the equilateral limit .",
    "for example , if we take all the divergent terms containing @xmath200 , we find pairs of terms like @xmath201 , where the only difference from the first term to the second is that @xmath202 changed position with @xmath203 , where @xmath204 can represent any of the momentum vectors @xmath205 and @xmath112 is @xmath206 . to complete the proof , one just needs to show that this combination is finite in the equilateral limit .",
    "after some algebra one can show that @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath209 . the r.h.s .",
    "of the previous equation is clearly finite in the limit @xmath210 .",
    "the proof of finiteness for the remaining divergent terms containing @xmath211 and @xmath212 in ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) is completely analogous to the proof just described but now one has to use the following combinations of terms .",
    "@xmath213,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath214.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , all divergent terms containing @xmath215 can be completely written in terms of the following combinations @xmath216        \\left [              2\\mathcal{a}_1 ^ 2+\\mathcal{a}_1\\left(k_{ab}-2k_d\\right)-2k_d\\left(k_d+k_{ab}\\right )        \\right ]       } { \\mathcal{a}_1 ^ 3\\mathcal{a}_2 ^ 3 }        , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath217        \\left [              \\mathcal{a}_1 ^ 2-\\mathcal{a}_1\\left(k_d+k_{ab}\\right)+2k_dk_{ab }        \\right ]       } { \\mathcal{a}_1 ^ 3\\mathcal{a}_2 ^ 3 }        , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath218        \\left [              \\mathcal{a}_2 ^ 2-\\mathcal{a}_2\\left(k_a+k_{ab}\\right)+2k_ak_{ab }        \\right ]       } { \\mathcal{a}_1 ^ 3\\mathcal{a}_2 ^ 3 }        .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all of these combinations are finite in the equilateral limit and all apparently divergent terms in the scalar exchange trispectrum ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) can be written in terms of these combinations .",
    "this implies that the trispectrum ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) is also finite in this limit as expected .",
    "it seems difficult to pursue an analytical answer for this question .",
    "the main reason is the fact that we need five degrees of freedom to parameterize the shape of the trispectrum and the expression for the trispectrum , eq .",
    "( [ totaltrizeta ] ) , is fairly complicated .",
    "numerical searches for the maximum in the full parameter space are possible even with such a large parameter space to explore .",
    "we leave this for future work .    in this appendix",
    ", we will relax the condition of equilateral configuration , allowing for two of the momentum vectors to have a different magnitude from the other two and we will show that the maximum that we found in subsection [ subsec : shape ] is still a maximum of @xmath1 .",
    "this provides some evidence that this particular configuration maximizes @xmath1 .",
    "before we show the results , it is interesting to consider analytically certain limiting configurations such as the squeezed limit or in the case of the scalar exchange diagram the counter - collinear limit .",
    "these limits give us other indications about where the maximum of the trispectrum might lie .",
    "also , because these limits can be obtained using different methods from the one used in this work , they provide consistency checks with our final answers .    as first pointed out by maldacena @xcite and seery _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , all higher order correlators of @xmath60 in single field inflation obey consistency relations in the squeezed limit , i.e. when one of the momentum vector is very small .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath219 , which implies that the corresponding mode @xmath220 leaves the horizon well before all other modes leave the horizon .",
    "by the time the remaining modes exit the horizon , @xmath220 will be frozen as a super - horizon mode and its only effect is to deform the background . following the algebra with some more detail",
    ", one finds the following relation for the trispectrum @xcite @xmath221 in the limit @xmath219 . using the fact that the bispectrum is @xmath222 it follows that in the squeezed limit according to ( [ consistencyrel2 ] ) the trispectrum is of @xmath223 . comparing this result with the full trispectrum , eq .",
    "( [ totaltrizeta ] ) , which is of order @xmath224 , one finds that the total non - linearity parameter @xmath1 calculated from ( [ totaltrizeta ] ) should be at most of order @xmath225 ( i.e. under our approximation it should vanish ) when any of the momentum vectors goes to zero .",
    "we verified that this is the case for ( [ totaltrizeta ] ) ) is only valid when all momentum vectors have similar magnitude as only in this case we can treat , for instance , @xmath226 as a constant . however",
    "the momentum dependence of ( [ totaltrizeta ] ) is such that @xmath227 goes to zero in the squeezed limit and this is consistent with ( [ consistencyrel2 ] ) ] .",
    "this would mean that the maximum of @xmath1 might lie near the equilateral configuration .",
    "as an example , we considered configurations where the two momentum vectors @xmath228 and @xmath229 have a different magnitude @xmath230 from the magnitude of @xmath231 and @xmath232 that we normalized to unity . then in this configuration , we have @xmath233 .",
    "the momentum conservation implies @xmath234 .",
    "we also allow one of the angular dof to vary freely , the other angular dof @xmath167 is fixed by @xmath235 to the value that gives us the maximum that we found in subsection [ subsec : shape ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : taunlnonequi ] , we plot the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 for the dbi - inflation model . from the momentum conservation ,",
    "@xmath236 is restricted to @xmath237 . also we restricted @xmath230 as @xmath238 as the configurations with @xmath239 can be related to those with @xmath238 by rescaling @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the left panel shows the contribution from the contact interaction . in the right panel",
    ", we plot the total @xmath1 . as can be seen in the r.h.s panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : taunlnonequi ] , the maximum of @xmath227 occurs exactly for the equilateral configuration when all the angles @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath242 are equal .",
    "this provides evidence that the maximum of the non - linearity parameter would happen for this configuration .     coming from the contact interaction diagram and the total @xmath1 as functions of the momentum amplitude @xmath230 and @xmath187 .",
    "the values were rescaled by @xmath191,width=529 ]",
    "in this appendix , we present the scalar exchange trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath60 for the dbi - inflation model in the equilateral configuration . these analytical expressions can be derived from the general expression for the scalar exchange trispectrum , eq .",
    "( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) .",
    "we will use these simpler equations to calculate the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 in subsection [ subsec : dbimodel ] and to study the shape dependence of the trispectrum in subsection [ subsec : shape ] .    at leading order in the small sound speed and in the slow - roll expansion , the scalar exchange trispectrum for the dbi inflationary model is @xmath243 where the three different contributions come from the terms in ( [ setrispectrumphi ] ) that are proportional to @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively .",
    "explicitly , they are given by @xmath244 @xmath245 @xmath246 where we have defined three @xmath247 functions , with @xmath248 , as @xmath249 where @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
