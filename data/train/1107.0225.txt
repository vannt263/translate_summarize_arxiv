    "contemporary cosmology faces currently major challenges .",
    "these include , for instance , the need to firmly establish the existence and nature of dark energy and dark matter , or to find evidence of a more encompassing theory of gravity .",
    "the nature of dark energy @xcite has been discussed in several proposals , including quintessence models , which consider the slow - roll of a scalar field @xcite , averaging of inhomogeneities at a cosmological scale yielding an effective scalar field @xcite , amongst other candidates .",
    "a possible unification of both `` dark '' components has also been suggested , resorting to a scalar field model @xcite or an exotic equation of state , as featured by the so - called generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "another outstanding difficulty in the context of the general relativity ( gr ) description of the universe dynamics and its relationship with the standard model of particle physics is the cosmological constant problem , a notorious adjustment issue that so far lacks a proper explanation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein for a discussion and a list of the most well known proposals for a solution ) .",
    "a different approach assumes that no extra energy content is needed , but that the fundamental laws and tenets of gravitation are incomplete , such that with current knowledge just offers a low - energy perspective of a more fundamental theory ; as a consequence , modifications of the friedmann equation to include higher order terms in the energy density @xmath0 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) have been proposed or , at a more fundamental level , changes to the action functional .",
    "a rather straightforward approach lies in replacing the linear scal ar curvature term in the einstein - hilbert action with a function of the scalar curvature , @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , one could resort to other scalar invariants of the theory @xcite : extensions relying on a functional dependence of the action on the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath2 are perhaps the most well studied models , as this could arise in a low - energy effective description of string theory and carry several implications in braneworld scenarios @xcite .",
    "the more tractable class of @xmath1 theories have had considerable success in replicating the early period of rapid expansion of the universe , with the starobinsky inflationary model @xmath3 being the most well - known proposal @xcite .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe has also been the subject of attention @xcite .",
    "solar system tests could also bring further insight , mostly arising from the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) metric coefficien ts derived from this extension of gr .",
    "however , some disagreement exists in the community , with some arguing that no changes are predicted at a post - newtonian level ( see _ e_.g . @xcite and references therein ) ; amongst other considerations , this mostly stems from an approach based either in the more usual metric affine connection ( that is , where the affine connection is taken _ a priori _ as depending on the metric ) , or in the so - called palatini approach @xcite ( where both the metric and the affine connection are taken as independent variables ) . as an example of a clear phenomenological consequence of this extension of gr",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath4 theories yield a gravitational potential which displays an increasing , repulsive contribution , added to the newtonian term @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the significant literature on these @xmath1 models , steps have been taken to explore another interesting possibility : not only that the curvature is non - trivial in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , but also that the coupling between matter and geometry is non - minimal , _",
    "i.e. _ enforced solely by the invariant @xmath5 , the use of the metric to raise and lower indexes and the associated covariant derivative ; indeed , in gr covariantly invariant terms in @xmath6 should be constructed by contraction with the metric ( _ e.g. _ the kinetic term of a real scalar field , @xmath7 ) : a non - minimum coupling would imply that geometric quantities ( such as the scalar invariants ) would explicitly appear in the action .",
    "this possibility can have deep phenomenological implications : in particular , it would imply that regions with high curvature ( which , in gr , are related to regions of high energy density or pressure ) could lead to considera ble deviations from the dynamics predicted by einstein s theory @xcite .",
    "a wide range of results has arisen from this hypothesis , including the formal equivalence with a multi - scalar - tensor theory @xcite , the impact on solar observables @xcite , the possibility to account for dark matter @xcite , post - inflationary reheating @xcite or the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .    when studying the latter , it was noted that one can not recover an exponential expansion due to a constant curvature , _",
    "i.e. _ a universe dominated by a cosmological constant ( cc ) , when working under the assumption of a friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "since this is the simplest of all culprits behind the mentioned accelerated expansion , one now reassesses this issue and attempts to obtain a local , spherically symmetric solution for the interstellar matter ( ism ) distribution that , in the context of a non - minimally coupled model , gives rise to a constant scalar curvature .",
    "this yields a mechanism that generates what can be viewed as a local cc .",
    "the superposition of several spherical distributions throughout the universe could then lead to a universal cc .",
    "of course , this is not a solution for the cosmological constant problem , but a proposal to account for the observations once a mechanism is found to make all other contributions vanish .",
    "the goal of this work is then to achieve this description without the requirement of a specific model for the non - minimal coupling or a somewhat awkward and convoluted density profile  _ i.e. _ although one shows that only a quite specific distribution gives rise to a constant curvature , this can be regarded as an admissible profile for the ism medium .",
    "one may also regard this work as yet another example of the strong impact a non - minimal coupling can have in the description of matter distribution , when compared with the standard results arising from gr .",
    "related proposals aiming to describe , for instance , dark energy through some variation of the concept of a non - minimal coupling between matter and geometry have been put forward previously , addressing the problem of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite and the existence of a cc @xcite . however",
    ", one posits that the approach proposed here is somewhat more economical and elegant , as it does not explicitly introduce any additional matter field , and it does not set any specific form for the non - minimally coupled terms .",
    "one considers a model that exhibits a non - minimal coupling between geometry and matter , as expressed in the action functional @xcite ,    s = d^4 x  .",

    "this feature implies that the motion of the matter distribution described by a lagrangian density @xmath14 does not follow a geodesic curve .",
    "clearly , a violation of the equivalence principle may emerge if the",
    "_ of the last equation varies significantly for different matter distributions , which suggests a method of testing the model and imposing constraints on the associated couplings .",
    "a constant curvature leads to @xmath15 and @xmath10 ; inserting this into , one gets    ( + f_2 ) g_r_0 = 4 f_2 _ - 2 f_2 t _  .",

    "<S> the purpose of this study is to describe a perfect fluid matter distribution that leads to a constant curvature region , thanks to the effect of a non - minimal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution exhibits a density profile within the range found in the interstellar medium and an adequate matching of the metric components at its boundary . by identifying this constant curvature with the value of the cosmological constant , and superimposing the spherical distributions arising from different matter sources throughout the universe , </S>",
    "<S> one is able to mimic a large - scale homogeneous cosmological constant solution . </S>"
