    "energetic arguments have long - favored the hypothesis that supernova shocks are responsible for the bulk of the cosmic ray ( cr ) flux at earth from @xmath2   to the `` knee '' , a flattening of the cr spectrum at approximately @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this requires that @xmath3 of the mechanical energy of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) be converted into relativistic particles over the remnants lifetime . in the favored model of this process",
    ", diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , self - generated magnetic turbulence provides scattering centers from which suprathermal particles may diffuse between the up- and downstream fluid , gaining energy ( on average ) with each shock crossing @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous non - thermal radio emission in snrs is evidence of gev electrons in snrs , and the x - ray synchrotron emission observed from the limbs of young snrs @xcite indicates the presence of electrons to tens of tevs . though cr nuclei comprise the vast majority of mass in snr relativistic particles , they do not radiate efficiently , and their presence must be inferred indirectly , either by the modification of the shock dynamics  @xcite and thermal state of the plasma  @xcite , or by the production of secondary pions  @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted significant amplification of the magnetic field in supernova shocks by cr - induced turbulent processes , allowing for acceleration to the knee within a snr lifetime .",
    "this picture is supported by high spatial resolution observations from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ that require high magnetic fields to explain the short synchrotron cooling time implied by the geometrically thin rims of young remnants  @xcite .",
    "an extensive theoretical literature has developed detailing a range of plasma instabilities that might generate these high fields .",
    "of these , the cosmic ray current driven instability ( crcd , often referred to as bell s non - resonant mechanism , * ? ? ? * ) , in which the magnetic field is amplified by turbulence generated by crs propagating ahead of the shock , has received the most study , though other processes ( e.g. , acoustic instabilities , resonant instabilities , etc . ) have been suggested .",
    "mhd @xcite and particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite show that the crcd instability drives plasma motions which suppress growth on small scales , until the dominant scale of the turbulence is comparable to the larmor radius of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "this results in a non - uniform medium with structured , filamentary density and field enhancements @xmath4  times greater than the mean quantities , surrounding cavities of size approximately equal to the larmor radius of the highest energy particles present .",
    "indeed , bell s analysis and simulations show that once the instability has saturated , the medium consists of a network of holes evacuated of plasma and field , enclosed by `` wandering filaments '' of high density and frozen - in field .",
    "one goal of observations is to discover evidence for structure in snr shocks on this spatial scale .",
    "we observed tycho in april 2009 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array , as part of a cycle 10 large program ( lp ) , using the 4 acis - i front - side illuminated ccds , operated in faint mode .",
    "the total program was split into nine individual obsids , which we reprocessed with ciao version 4.1 , using the gain tables and cti correction in caldb 4.1.3 .",
    "examination of the lightcurves revealed no significant background flares .",
    "the registration of the individual pointings was improved using the measured relative positions of background point sources , though the necessary shifts were typically @xmath51@xmath6 . for imaging analyses ,",
    "the registered event lists were merged using the standard ciao tools , and have a total average livetime of @xmath7 . for spectroscopy , counts were extracted and rmfs and arfs were generated for each individual obsid , which we fit jointly in xspec version 12.6.0 .    in figure [ imagefig ]",
    "we show the image from the 46 kev band , which is dominated by the synchrotron component of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "apart from the well - known limb - brightened shell , a number of bright regions are seen toward the projected interior of the remnant . while the strongest of these features are visible in earlier _ chandra _  data  @xcite our deeper observation reveals a striking pattern of nearly - regularly spaced stripes .",
    "the brightest group , centered @xmath8  interior to the western limb ( see figure [ stripefig ] ) , has a peak surface brightness twice that of the brightest sections of the rims , and is the primary subject of this communication . a second",
    ", fainter pattern extends east - west , @xmath9  inside the southern rim , and there is evidence for several other regions of striping near the detection limit .",
    "comparison with a shallower 2004 _ chandra _  observation reveals no statistically significant change in the brightness of the stripes , ruling out any dramatic flux variability like that observed in the non - thermal x - ray filaments of the snr rx  j1713.7 - 3946  @xcite .",
    "our preliminary proper motion measurements for the stripes are consistent with the overall expansion of the blast wave and , in particular , show no evidence for non - radial flow .",
    "there are no obvious counterparts to these features in the radio  @xcite , nor in the mid - ir .",
    "before investigating the nature of the stripes , we first must locate them within the three - dimensional volume of the remnant . the canonical picture of a young snr consists of three distinct fluid discontinuities : the blast wave , which marks the shock propagating into the ambient medium , a rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) unstable contact discontinuity ( cd ) at the ejecta - interstellar material boundary , and a reverse shock that propagates into the stellar remains .",
    "@xcite set an upper - limit for the azimuthally - dependent projected radius of the reverse shock in tycho using the location of the fe k@xmath10  emission .",
    "adopting their center of expansion , the western stripes peak at a radius of 220 , well outside the 190  position of the reverse shock at that azimuth .",
    "while the position of the stripes does coincide with the warren et al .",
    "estimate of the cd , the regularly - spaced , linear morphology of the non - thermal stripes does not correspond to any features in the r - t plumes of thermal emission tracing the ejecta boundary , nor is the cd a prominent feature elsewhere in the 46 kev band .",
    "conversely , the blast wave is a bright source of 46 kev emission , and we identify the stripes as projected features of this forward shock .    tycho s blast wave is traced by a very thin shell of x - ray emission , with a typical thickness only 1 - 2% of its radius  @xcite . since the stripes are seen in projection away from the rim ,",
    "their line - of - sight pathlength through the shell is small .",
    "thus their intrinsic emissivity must be high relative to the limb regions .",
    "we examined two regions of different brightness on the western rim with minimal ejecta contamination , and assumed a spherical shell model with a radius of 214 , chosen to match the curvature of the western limb .",
    "the radial brightness profile of the brighter rim region is too narrow and peaked to be consistent with a simple projected shell geometry , meaning that its high surface brightness likely arises from a local enhancement in emissivity , perhaps similar to the stripes .",
    "in contrast , the profile of the fainter region is well - fit by a shell with thickness 2% of its radius , and is likely more typical of the blast wave as a whole .",
    "this simple model predicts that features at 80% of the shock radius ( where the stripes are located ) would have a surface brightness 20% that of the limb",
    ". the observed peak surface brightness of the stripes is , however , 5 times that of the faint limb region .",
    "thus the peak intrinsic emissivity of the synchrotron - emitting plasma in the stripes must be a factor of 25 higher than is typical for the blast wave . in principle",
    ", this brightening could be due to a local enhancement in the ambient density and/or magnetic field .",
    "while we can not entirely exclude this possibility , we consider the existence of a pre - existing structure around tycho with the right combination of increased density , magnetic field , and , as we show below , turbulence necessary to produce the observed correlations between the ordered structure and spectral variations improbable .",
    "in contrast , models of cr - driven magnetic field amplification produce structure in the precursor density and field , and we find it more likely that the stripes mark a region extensively modified by the acceleration process .",
    "this assumption is implicit in the analysis in this letter .",
    "the spatial position of the stripes , seen in projection against the bright thermal x - rays of the shocked ejecta , greatly complicates spectroscopy .",
    "this can be mitigated by restricting analysis to the 4.2 - 10 kev range , where the emission is dominated by the synchrotron continuum and the fe k@xmath10  line complex at @xmath116.45 kev . throughout this work we set the absorbing column to @xmath12 , which has negligible effect at these energies .",
    "the spectrum of the brightest stripe is well - fit with a power - law of photon index of @xmath13 , significantly harder than the spectrum of the entire snr at these energies ( @xmath14 ; this fit includes faint lines identified by @xcite ) , and a coaddition of several of the lower surface brightness stripes ( @xmath15 ; this fit includes an fe k line ) .    while photon indices are useful for characterization of the non - thermal spectrum , the broadband spectrum gradually departs from a simple power law over several decades in energy .",
    "detailed dsa models of synchrotron spectra show a small degree of curvature through the radio to uv , with a cut - off in the x - rays , set ( in young snrs like tycho ) by the short cooling time of tev - scale electrons  @xcite .",
    "absent detailed spectral calculations for tycho , we adopt a common approximation and assume a power - law electron momentum distribution with an exponential cut - off , which produces a photon spectrum that is nearly a power - law from the radio through the uv and is curved in x - rays  @xcite .",
    "for this model , the low energy index ( @xmath16 ) and the flux normalization are set by radio observations , while the location of the high energy cut - off is constrained with the x - ray spectrum . for the spectrum of the entire remnant , assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath17 , a flux density at 1 ghz of @xmath1150 jy  @xcite , and again including the faint x - ray emission lines from @xcite , the fit to the _ chandra _  data gives @xmath18 .",
    "this provides a remarkably good fit ( @xmath19 ) , and is consistent with measurements from _ suzaku_. ( the statistical error on this number is so small as to be irrelevant ; the precision to which we measure it is far greater than the efficacy of our emission model or the accuracy of the radio flux and spectral index measurements . )",
    "if we instead assume @xmath20 @xcite , the fit is slightly worse ( @xmath21 ) , and the cut - off moves to lower energies ( @xmath22 ) . for the stripes , we estimated the radio flux in these regions from a vla map .",
    "the fits favor slightly shallower indices ( @xmath23 ) and higher cut - off energies , @xmath24   for the bright stripe and @xmath25for the ensemble of fainter stripes .",
    "we plot the broadband synchrotron spectra of these regions in figure [ specfig ] .",
    "although it is clear that the bright stripe and faint ensemble spectra require different best - fit parameter values , in principle these differences might be due to either different cut - off frequencies or radio spectral indices .",
    "our spectral analysis ( detailed in table [ fitstab ] ) allows us to discriminate between these two options .",
    "when the spectra for the bright and faint regions are fit with radio flux densities fixed at their nominal values , both regions prefer an index very close to the average for the entire remnant .",
    "conversely , if we instead require that both regions have the same cut - off , the fitted radio indices are @xmath26  ( bright ) and @xmath27  ( faint )",
    ". we can not reject this level of variation outright since measurements of the spatial variation of the radio spectral index are not available for tycho , though in cas a ( a plausible comparison object ) the radio index does vary spatially by much as @xmath28 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the best fit for a single cut - off frequency is clearly worse ( @xmath29 ) than for independent cut - off values .",
    "an @xmath30-test shows that the fit including independent cut - off frequencies is an improvement at a significance level of more than @xmath31 .",
    "thus we conclude that the cut - off frequencies are significantly different in the bright and faint spectral regions analysed .",
    "dsa requires magnetic field inhomogeneities strong enough that particles can scatter multiple times across the shock front .",
    "this diffusion of crs in the magnetized turbulence is generally assumed to be close to the bohm regime , where the mean - free path is the particle gyroradius .",
    "departure from this limit can be parameterized as @xmath32 , where @xmath33  is the diffusion coefficient at the electron cut - off energy .",
    "@xcite show that for an electron distribution limited by synchrotron losses , the photon cut - off energy ( @xmath34 ) is set by the diffusion coefficient , shock velocity ( @xmath35 , in units of 1000 km s@xmath36 ) , and compression ratio , @xmath37 : @xmath38 at a distance of @xmath39 @xcite , with a blast wave proper motion of @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 . for an unmodified shock ( @xmath42 ) and our fit cut - off energies , @xmath43  5.8 ( whole snr ) , @xmath44 ( faint stripes ) , and @xmath45  ( bright stripe ) . with a higher compression more applicable to tycho ( @xmath46 ) , these numbers become @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "( the error bars reflect only the statistical error in @xmath50 , and not the @xmath51  uncertainty in the distance to tycho . )",
    "our value for the whole snr is near to those found by @xcite for tycho ( @xmath52 ) , while the very small numbers for the brightest stripe are similar to their results for g347.3 - 0.5 and sn 1006 ( @xmath53 ) . since @xmath54for isotropic turbulence",
    ", this may be due to our oversimplified emission model , and could indicate that the photon spectrum falls more gradually to high energies , as seen in some dsa calculations @xcite , or may be indicative of anisotropic diffusion @xcite .",
    "regardless , our measured photon cut - off energies require an order of magnitude decrease in the diffusion coefficient in the stripes relative to the average value in tycho , and indicate that diffusion in the stripes is very near the bohm limit . furthermore , since bohm diffusion requires @xmath55 , @xmath56  implies fully developed turbulence , at least on the scale of the gyroradius of the highest energy ( @xmath11 tev ) electrons in the brightest stripes .      might the spatial structure and enhanced turbulence in the stripes be a manifestation of the plasma instability driving the cosmic ray acceleration ?",
    "the largest possible characteristic scale of the acceleration process is set by the gyroradius of the highest energy particles present .",
    "if we identify the gaps between the stripes ( @xmath57 ) with twice the proton gyroradius , an estimate of the magnetic field yields a measurement of the energy , given by equation  [ ecr ] .",
    "@xmath58 the choice of @xmath59  is somewhat uncertain . if the stripes are a consequence of the highest energy crs interacting with the non - amplified ism field ( @xmath60 ) , for a gap spacing of 8 , @xmath61 .",
    "however , these features may arise from a region where the field has already been somewhat amplified . for a shock velocity of @xmath62 ,",
    "fits to models of tycho s synchrotron emission @xcite predict an upstream field strength of @xmath63 , indicating @xmath64  just at the knee of the galactic cr spectrum .",
    "if the bell mechanism is active in the magnetic field amplification in snr shocks , and if the pattern of stripes we observe in tycho is an observable consequence of this process , the stripes are direct evidence of particles accelerated to the knee .",
    "there are several caveats to consider before accepting this conclusion .",
    "most obviously , while mhd and pic simulations of the crcd generate structure in the amplified medium , they do not show the regular and nearly periodic pattern that we observe in tycho .",
    "secondly , when the cr back - reaction is included @xcite , pic simulations indicate that the bell instability alone may be neither fast nor efficient enough to provide the observed amplification , particularly for tycho s low ambient density .",
    "additional instabilities are required , and seem to be indicated by the degree of turbulence in the stripes implied by our observations .",
    "@xcite propose a new instability ( the parallel current driven instability , pcdi ) that acts on smaller scales ( i.e. , lower energies ) and provides significant field amplification over that established by the crcd .",
    "further theoretical work on the degree of turbulence generated by proposed mechanisms on tev particle scales seems particularly warranted .",
    "regardless , the match in scales between the observed spacing of the tycho stripes and the larmor radius of knee - region crs  a scale intrinsic to the crcd  is tantalizing , while the ordered structure presents a challenge to current models of diffusive shock acceleration .",
