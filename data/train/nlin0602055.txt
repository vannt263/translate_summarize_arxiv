    "-1 cm    the phenomenon known as  drag reduction \" by polymers in turbulent channel flows @xcite is conveniently discussed in channel geometry for fixed pressure heads , such that the reduction in the drag is manifested as an increased mean velocity . for the sake of comparison between different fluids",
    "it is convenient to choose normalized coordinates .",
    "denote the mean pressure ( per unit density ) gradient @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lengthwise , wall - normal and spanwise directions respectively .",
    "the length and width of the channel are usually taken much larger than the mid - channel height @xmath4 , making the latter a natural re - scaling length for the introduction of dimensionless ( similarity ) variables , also known as  wall units \" @xcite .",
    "thus the reynolds number re , the normalized distance from the wall @xmath5 and the normalized mean velocity @xmath6 ( which is in the @xmath1 direction with a dependence on @xmath2 only ) are defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity of the neat fluid . for newtonian fluids the profile of the mean velocity @xmath6 is universal , starting with the viscous sub - layer in which @xmath9 and then , at @xmath5 somewhere between 6 and 12 , the profile crosses over to the universal von - krmn log - law of the wall ( cf .",
    "[ expt ] ) @xmath10 upon the addition of small concentrations of polymers , the drag is reduced and for the same value of @xmath11 one finds an increase in @xmath6 .",
    "this phenomenon exhibits both universal and non - universal aspects .",
    "the universal aspect is the maximum drag reduction ( mdr ) asymptote , which is the largest attainable profile @xmath6 .",
    "this was determined experimentally by virk who found @xcite @xmath12 while @xmath13 , @xmath14 , leading to a significantly larger mean velocity at the mdr as compared with von - krmn s log - law .",
    "the mdr appears independent of the nature of the polymer ( for example whether it is flexible or rodlike ) , of the length of the polymer and of the concentration . on the other hand ,",
    "the way that the system _ attains _ the mdr is not universal , and it depends on all of the above . in particular , it appears that flexible and rodlike polymers attain the mdr , as a function of the concentration , in qualitatively different ways ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental information is quite scant , but available data indicate different scenarios for the two types of polymers . the data in fig .",
    "[ expt ] indicate for large values of re the mean velocity profile with flexible polymers [ polyacrylamide ( paa ) ] follows the mdr until a point of cross over back to the  newtonian plug \" , where it becomes parallel to von - krmn s log - law .",
    "increasing the concentration results in following the mdr further until a higher cross over point is attained back to the newtonian plug @xcite . on the other hand , for rodlike polymers [ sodium carboxymethylcellulose ( cmc ) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose / xanthan gum blend ( cmc / xg ) ] the data shown in fig .",
    "[ expt ] indicate a different scenario .",
    "contrary to flexible polymers , here , as a function of the concentration , one finds mean velocity profiles that interpolate between the two asymptotes ( [ llw ] ) and ( [ final ] ) , reaching the mdr only for large concentrations . a difference in the behavior of flexible and rodlike polymers when plotting the drag as a function of reynolds number",
    "was also reported by virk and coworkers , see @xcite .",
    "the universal mdr was fully explained in recent work , and its parameters derived , by showing that it is an edge turbulent solution in a channel @xcite . in other words , if one tried to reduce the drag further ( or further increase the profile @xmath6 ) , one would lose the turbulent flow in favor of a laminar solution .",
    "this is the reason for the universality of the mdr and its insensitivity to the nature of the polymer .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive quantitatively the non - universal scenarios of attaining the mdr by flexible and rodlike polymers .",
    "we will limit our attention to the case of high re , and consider the profiles @xmath6 for different concentrations , with the aim of explaining the phenomenology displayed in fig .",
    "the paper ends with a definite prediction of different crossover behavior in the mean velocity profiles for flexible and rodlike polymers , in agreement with the indication of fig .",
    "[ expt ] .    in sect .",
    "2 we summarize the available theory of drag reduction by flexible and rodlike polymers , based on the balance equations for energy and momentum in the turbulent boundary layer . we derive in this section the equations satisfied by the @xmath2 dependence of the mean shear ( in wall units ) , from which the velocity profiles are obtained by integration . sect . 3 presents the results together with a summary and a discussion .",
    "in the presence of a small concentration of polymers the navier - stokes equations for the fluid velocity @xmath15 gain an additional stress tensor : @xmath16 the extra stress tensor @xmath17 is due to the interaction between the polymers and the fluid . within the fene - p model for flexible polymers we have @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the polymeric contribution to the viscosity at zero shear , and",
    "@xmath20 is the inverse relaxation time of the stretched polymer . in writing",
    "this expression one adopts the standard simplification of a single relaxation time .",
    "the conformation tensor @xmath21 is obtained from the normalized end - to - end distance vector of the polymer @xmath22 , averaged over the conformation of the polymers , @xmath23    for rodlike polymer @xmath24 becomes a unit vector , and there is no coil - stretching transition . accordingly the stress tensor assumes a different form @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strain experienced by the polymer @xmath27 . as explained above ,",
    "the difference in form of the stress tensor is immaterial for the universal form of the mdr @xcite , a phenomenon that was called `` additive equivalence '' by virk .",
    "we will see that this difference translates however to a very different scenario for the attainment of the mdr .",
    "the phenomenon of drag reduction can be understood on the basis of the balance equations of the mechanical momentum and turbulent energy @xcite .",
    "these are derived on the basis of the reynolds decomposition @xmath28 writing these equations we use the fact that in a turbulent channel flow @xmath11 is constant , and due to the symmetry all the other mean quantities depend on @xmath2 only .",
    "in addition to the mean shear @xmath29 , we need to to introduce the mean turbulent kinetic energy @xmath30 and the reynolds stress @xmath31 .",
    "the momentum balance equation is obtained by averaging eq .",
    "( [ navier ] ) and integrating with respect to @xmath2 , ending up with the exact equation : @xmath32    in wall - units eq .",
    "( [ raw_mom ] ) can be written in a more elegant form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . when re is very large and for @xmath5 not too large we neglect the second term on the rhs , approximating the rhs as unity",
    ".    the balance equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated by taking the dot product of the fluctuation part of eq .",
    "( [ navier ] ) with @xmath37 : @xmath38 also this equation is exact .",
    "we simplify it by noting that the first term on the rhs involves the spatial flux of turbulent energy which is known to be negligible in the log - layer .",
    "the second term represents the dissipation which is modelled ( in wall - units ) as @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the energy balance equation takes on the form @xmath42 finally , we quote the experimental fact that in the log - layer @xmath43 and @xmath44 are proportional to each other : @xmath45 experimentally , it was found that @xmath46 in the newtonian case , and @xmath47 in the mdr .      in the newtonian case , when @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the three equations ( [ mom ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ kw ] ) are sufficient for determining the three unknowns @xmath50 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "the best fit to newtonian experiments and simulations are obtained using the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and we are going to use these values throughout , also in the viscoelastic cases discussed below . in the presence of polymers , however , we have to consider the terms introduced by the polymers to these equations .",
    "the necessary theory was presented in @xcite , with the final results relating these terms to the @xmath53 component of the mean conformation tensor @xmath54 : .",
    "@xmath55 using these theoretical results the momentum and energy equations , in the limit of large re , are reduced to @xmath56 and @xmath57 here @xmath58 . to proceed we need to relate @xmath59 to the other variables .",
    "the necessary theory is presented in @xcite leading to an important difference between the flexible and the rodlike polymers : @xmath60 substituting into eqs .",
    "( [ mom1 ] ) and ( [ en1 ] ) we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 with the  effective viscosity \" @xmath63    in the next section we will show that although the effective viscosities take on different forms for the flexible and rodlike cases , in fact they both depend linearly on @xmath5 whenever we have a log layer with @xmath64 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath44 turns out to be proportional to @xmath65 and to @xmath5 for the flexible and the rodlike cases respectively .",
    "accordingly , we will write in both cases @xmath66 \\ , \\label{nueff}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 being the width of the viscous sub - layer , and its dependence on the slope of the effective viscosity @xmath68 needs to be determined .",
    "it is natural to present @xmath67 in terms of a dimensionless scaling function @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the width of the newtonian viscous boundary layer . in the newtonian limit @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 , hence we have @xmath75 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the balance equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ( with the prescribed form of the effective viscosity profile ) have an non - trivial symmetry that leaves them invariant under rescaling of the wall units .",
    "this symmetry dictates the function @xmath67 in the form @xmath76      to complete the model , we have to specify the value of @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ kw ] ) .",
    "this parameter becomes naturally a function of @xmath68 .",
    "we can find its @xmath68-dependence by identifying the width of the viscous sub - layer @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this stems from the fact that the balance equations can not support a turbulent solution for @xmath80 .",
    "this means that @xmath81 combining then eqs .",

    "( [ nu1 ] ) and ( [ nu2 ] ) can be written as @xmath84 with @xmath85    using eqs .",
    "( [ kw ] ) and ( [ k ] ) , we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) as two equations for the two variables @xmath86 and @xmath50 : @xmath87 and @xmath88    equation ( [ neq2 ] ) implies @xmath89 substituting eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ neq1 ] ) gives an equation for @xmath86 : @xmath90    finally , we can solve eq .",
    "( [ fnueff ] ) to get @xmath91 for different values of @xmath92 .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath50 and @xmath44 using eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and ( [ k ] ) respectively . integrating @xmath50 over @xmath5 ,",
    "we get also @xmath6 .",
    "the results of the numerical solutions of the equations are shown in figs .",
    "[ figflex ] , [ rod ] and [ figk ] .    in figs .",
    "[ figflex ] and [ rod ] we present the mean velocity profile as a function of the distance from the wall , for flexible and rodlike polymers respectively .",
    "the main result of this paper is seen in the difference between these profiles as a function of the polymer concentration .",
    "while the flexible polymer case exhibits the feature @xcite that the velocity profile adheres to the mdr until a crossover to the newtonian plug is realized , the rodlike case presents a  diverging \" of profiles which only asymptotically reach the mdr .",
    "we also notice that the flexible polymer matches the mdr faithfully for relatively low values of @xmath92 , whereas the rodlike case attains the mdr only for much higher values of @xmath92 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the experimental finding in @xcite that the flexible polymer is a better drag reducer than the rodlike analogue .",
    "we should note that the higher efficacy of flexible polymers can not be easily related to their elongational viscosity as measured in laminar flows . in some studies @xcite it was proposed that there is a correlation between the elongational viscosity measured in laminar flows and the drag reduction measured in turbulent flows .",
    "we find here that flexible polymers do better in turbulent flows due to their contribution to the effective shear viscosity , and their improved capability in drag reduction stems simply from their ability to stretch , something that rodlike polymers can not do .",
    "finally we recall that the derivation of our equations relied on the fact that the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath44 depends linearly and quadratically on the distance from the wall for flexible and rodlike polymers respectively .",
    "it is important to check that the resulting equations confirm this expectation self - consistently .",
    "indeed , in fig . [ figk ]",
    "we present the solution for this quantity in the two cases , and find that the expectation is fully realized ."
