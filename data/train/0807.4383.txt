    "after more than a century from its birth , quantum mechanics ( qm ) remains mysterious .",
    "we still do nt have general principles from which to derive its remarkable mathematical framework , as it happened for the amazing lorentz s transformations , lately re - derived by einstein s from invariance of physical laws on inertial frames and from constancy of the speed of light .    despite the utmost relevance of the problem of deriving qm from operational principles ,",
    "research efforts in this direction have been sporadic .",
    "the deepest of the early attacks on the problem were the works of birkoff , von neumann , jordan , and wigner , attempting to derive qm from a set of axioms with as much physical significance as possible @xcite .",
    "the general idea in ref .",
    "@xcite is to regard qm as a new kind of _ prepositional calculus _ , a proposal that spawned the research line of _ quantum logic _ , based on von neumann s",
    "observation that the two - valued observables  represented in his formulation of qm by orthogonal projection operators  constitute a kind of `` logic '' of experimental propositions . after a hiatus of two decades of neglect , interest in quantum logic was revived by varadarajan @xcite , and most notably by mackey @xcite , who axiomatized qm within an operational framework , with the single exception of an admittedly _ ad hoc _ postulate , which represents the propositional - calculus mathematically in form of an orthomodular lattice .",
    "the most significant extension of mackey s work is the general representation theorem of piron @xcite .    in the early work @xcite ,",
    "jordan , von neumann , and wigner considered the possibility of a commutative algebra of observables , with a product which needs only to define squares and sums of observables  the so - called _ jordan product _ of observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "however , such a product is generally non - associative and non - distributive with respect to the sum , and the quantum formalism follows only with additional axioms with no clear physical significance_e.g .",
    "_ a distributivity axiom for the jordan product .",
    "segal @xcite later constructed an ( almost ) fully operational framework ( with no experimental definition of the sum of observables ) which allows generally non - distributive algebras of observables , but with a resulting mathematical framework largely more general than qm . as a result of this line of investigation , the purely algebraic formulation of qm gathered popularity versus the original hilbert - space axiomatization .    in the algebraic axiomatization of qm ,",
    "a physical system is defined by its @xmath4-algebra of observables ( with identity ) , and the states of the system are identified with normalized positive linear functionals over the algebra , corresponding to the probability rules of measurements of observables .",
    "indeed , the @xmath4-algebra of observables is more general than qm , since it includes classical mechanics as a special case , and generally describes any quantum - classical hybrid , equivalent to qm with super - selection rules . since in practice",
    "two observables are not distinguishable if they always exhibit the same probability distributions , at the operational level one can always take the set of states as _ observable - separating_in the sense that there are no different observables having the same probability distribution for all states .",
    "conversely the set of observables is _ state - separating _ , _",
    "i.e. _ there are no different states corresponding to the same probability distribution for all observables .",
    "notice that , in principle , there exist different observables with the same expectation for all states , but higher moments will be different . ]    the algebra of observables is generally considered to be more `` operational '' than the usual hilbert - space axiomatization , however , little is gained more than a representation - independent mathematical framework .",
    "indeed , the algebraic framework is unable to provide operational rules for how to measure sums and products of non - commuting observables .",
    "and @xmath5 are both @xmath6 , whereas the angular momentum component @xmath7 has discrete spectrum .",
    "the same is true for the product . ]",
    "the sum of two observables can not be given an operational meaning , since a procedure involving the measurements of the two addenda would unavoidably assume that their respective measurements are jointly executable on the same system_i.e .",
    "_ the observables are _",
    "the same reasoning holds for the product of two observables . a sum - observable defined as",
    "the one having expectation equal to the sum of expectations for all states @xcite is clearly not unique , due to the existence of observables having the same expectation for all states , but with different higher moments .",
    "the only well defined procedures are those involving single observables , such as the measurement of a _ function of a single observable _ , which operationally consists in just taking the function of the outcome",
    ".    the jordan symmetric product has been regarded as a great advance in view of an operational axiomatization , since , in addition to being hermitian ( observables are hermitian ) , is defined only in terms of squares and sums of observables_i.e . _ without products .",
    "the definition of @xmath8 , however , still relies on the notion of sum of observables , which has no operational meaning .",
    "remarkably , alfsen and shultz @xcite succeeded in deriving the jordan product from solely geometrical properties of the convex set of states_e.g . _ orientability and faces shaped as euclidean balls  however , again with no operational meaning .",
    "the problem with the jordan product is that , in addition to not necessarily being associative , it is not even distributive , as the reader can easily check himself .",
    "it turns out that , modulo a few topological assumptions , the jordan algebras can be embedded in the algebra @xmath9 of operators over the hilbert space @xmath10 , whereby @xmath11 .",
    "such assumptions , however , are still not operational . for further critical overview of these earlier attempts to an operational axiomatization of qm , the reader",
    "is also directed to the recent books of strocchi @xcite and thirring @xcite .",
    "after a long suspension of research on the axiomatic approach  notably interrupted by the work of ludwig and his school @xcite  in the last years the new field of quantum information has renewed the interest on the problem of operational axiomatization of qm , boosted by the new experience on multipartite systems and _ entanglement_. in his seminal paper @xcite hardy derived qm from five `` reasonable axioms '' , which , more than being truly operational , are motivated on the basis of simplicity and continuity criteria , with the assumption of a finite number of perfectly discriminable states .",
    "his axiom 4 , however , is still purely mathematical , and is directly related to the tensor product rule for composite systems . in another popular paper @xcite , clifton , bub , and halvorson have shown how three fundamental information - theoretic constraints(a ) the no - signaling , ( b ) the no - broadcasting , ( c ) the impossibility of unconditionally secure bit commitment  suffice to entail that the observables and state space of a physical theory are quantum - mechanical .",
    "unfortunately , the authors already started from a c@xmath0-algebraic framework for observables , which , as already discussed , has little operational basis , and already coincides with the quantum - classical hybrid .",
    "therefore , more than deriving qm , their informational principles just force the c@xmath0-algebra of observables to be non - abelian .    in ref .",
    "@xcite i showed how it is possible to derive the formulation of qm in terms of observables represented as hermitian operators over hilbert spaces with the right dimensions for the tensor product , starting from few operational axioms .",
    "however , it is not clear yet if such framework is sufficient to identify qm ( or the quantum - classical hybrid ) as the only probabilistic theory resulting from axioms .",
    "later , in refs .",
    "@xcite i have shown how a c@xmath0-algebraic framework for transformations ( not for observables ! ) naturally follows from an operational probabilistic framework .    a very recent and promising direction for attacking the problem of qm axiomatization consists in positioning qm within the landscape of general probabilistic theories , including theories with non - local correlations stronger than the quantum ones , _",
    "e.g. _ for the popescu - rohrlich boxes ( pr - boxes ) @xcite .",
    "such theories have correlations that are `` stronger '' than the quantum ones  in the sense that they violate the quantum cirelson bound @xcite  although they are still non - signaling , thus revealing the fortuitousness of the peaceful coexistence of qm and special relativity , in contrast with the claimed implication of qm linearity from the no - signaling condition @xcite . within the framework of the pr - boxes",
    "general versions of the no - cloning and no - broadcasting theorems have been proved @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that certain features generally thought of as specifically quantum , are indeed present in all except classical theories .",
    "these include the non - unique decomposition of a mixed state into pure states , disturbance on measurement ( related to the possibility of secure key distribution ) , and no - cloning .",
    "more recently , necessary and sufficient conditions have been established for teleportation @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ for reconstructing the state of a system on a remote identical system , using only local operations and joint states .",
    "in all these works quantum information has inspired task - oriented axioms to be considered in a general operational framework that can incorporate qm , classical theory , and other non - signaling probabilistic theories ( for an illustration of this general point of view see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "i will consider the possibility of deriving qm as the mathematical representation of a _ fair operational framework _ , _",
    "i.e. _ a set of rules which allows the experimenter to make predictions regarding future _ events _ on the basis of suitable _ tests _ , in a spirit close to ludwig s axiomatization @xcite .",
    "_ states _ are simply the compendia of probabilities for all possible outcomes of any test .",
    "i will consider a very general class of probabilistic theories , and examine the consequences of two postulates that need to be satisfied by any fair operational framework :    * _ no - signaling from the future _ , implying that it is possible to make predictions based on present tests ; * _ existence of preparationally faithful states _ , implying the possibility of preparing any state and calibrating any test .",
    "nsf is implicit in the definition itself of conditional probabilities for cascade - tests , entailing that _ events are identified with transformations _ , whence _ evolution is identified with conditioning_. as we will see , such identifications lead to the notion of _ effect _ of ludwig , _ i.e. _ the equivalence class of events occurring with the same probability for all states .",
    "i will show how we can introduce operationally a linear - space structure for effects .",
    "i will then show how all theories satisfying nsf admit a c@xmath0-algebra representation of events as linear transformations of effects .",
    "based on a very general notion of dynamical independence , entailing the definition of _ marginal state _ , it is immediately seen that all these theories are _ non - signaling _ , which is the current way of saying that the theories satisfy the principle of _ einstein locality _ , namely that there can be no detectable effect on a system due to anything done to another non - interacting system .",
    "this is clearly another requirement for a fair operational framework . postulate pfaith then implies the _ local observability principle _ , namely the possibility of achieving an informationally complete test using only local tests  another requirement for a fair operational framework .",
    "the same postulate also implies many other features that are typically quantum , such as the tensor - product structure for the linear spaces of states and effects , the isomorphism of cones of states and effects  a weaker version of the quantum selfduality  impossibility of bit commitment ( which in ref .",
    "@xcite we remind it was used as a postulate itself to derive qm ) , and many more .",
    "dual to postulate pfaith an analogous postulate for effects would give additional quantum features , such as teleportation .",
    "however , all possible consequences of these postulates still need to be investigated , and it is not clear yet if one can derive qm from these principles only .    in order to provide a route for seeking new candidates for operational postulates one can short - circuit the axiomatic framework to select qm using a mathematical postulate dictated by what is really special about the quantum theory , namely that not only transformations , but also _ effects form a c@xmath0-algebra _ (",
    "more precisely , this is true for all hybrid quantum - classical theories , _ i.e. _ corresponding to qm plus super - selection rules ) .",
    "however , whereas the sum of effects can be operationally defined , their composition has no operational meaning , since the notion itself of `` effect '' abhors any kind of composition .",
    "i will then show that with another natural postulate ,    * atomicity of evolution ,    along with the mathematical postulate ,    * choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite ,    _ it is possible to identify effects with `` atomic '' events _ , _ i.e. _ elementary events which can not be refined as the union of events . via the composition of atomic events",
    "we can then define the composition of effects , thus selecting the quantum - classical hybrid among all possible general probabilistic theories ( including the pr - boxes , which indeed satisfy both nsf and pfaith ) .",
    "the cj isomorphism looks natural in an operational context , and it is hoped that it will be converted soon into an operational postulate .",
    "the present operational axiomatization will adhere to the following three general principles :    1 .   * ( strong copenhagen ) * everything is defined operationally , including all mathematical objects .",
    "operationally indistinguishable entities are identified .",
    "( mathematical closure ) * mathematical completion is taken for convenience .",
    "( operational closure ) * every operational option that is implicit in the formulation is incorporated in the axiomatic framework .",
    "an example of the application of the strongly copenhagen principle is the notion of _ system _ , which here i will identify with a collection of tests  the tests that can be performed over the system .",
    "a typical case of operational identification is that of events occurring with the same probability and producing the same conditioning .",
    "another case is the statement that the set of states is separating for effects and viceversa .",
    "examples of mathematical closure are the norm closure , the algebraic closure , and the linear span .",
    "it is unquestionable that these are always idealizations of operational limiting cases , or they are introduced just to simplify the mathematical formulation ( _ e.g. _ real numbers versus the `` operational '' rational numbers ) .",
    "operational completeness , on the other hand , does not affect the corresponding mathematical representation , since every incorporated option is already implicit in the formulation .",
    "this is the case , for example , for convex closure , closure under coarse - graining , etc . which are already implicit in the probabilistic formulation .",
    "a probabilistic operational framework is a collection of * tests * @xmath12 each being a complete collection @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,  of mutually exclusive * events * @xmath16 occurring probabilistically as the pair @xmath17 made of the _ basic space _ @xmath18the collection of outcomes  and of the @xmath19-algebra of events @xmath20 . here , to decrease the mathematical load of the framework",
    ", we conveniently identify the experiment with the basic space only , and consider a different @xmath19-algebra ( _ e.g. _ a coarse graining ) as a new test made of new mutually exclusive events .",
    "indeed , since we are considering only discrete basic spaces , we can put basic space and @xmath19-algebra in one - to - one correspondence , by taking @xmath21the power set of @xmath18and , viceversa , @xmath22 as the collection of the minimal intersections of elements of @xmath20 . ] ; events that are mutually exclusive are often called * outcomes*. the same event can occur in different tests , with occurrence probability independent on the test . a * singleton test*also called a * channel*@xmath23 is * deterministic * : it represents a non - test , _ i.e. _ a free evolution .",
    "the * union * @xmath24 of two events corresponds to the event in which either @xmath25 or @xmath26 occurred , but it is unknown which one .",
    "a * refinement * of an event @xmath25 is a set of events @xmath27 occurring in some test such that @xmath28 .",
    "the experiment itself @xmath29 can be regarded as the deterministic event corresponding to the complete union of its outcomes , and when regarded as an event it will be denoted by the different notation @xmath30 .",
    "the opposite event of @xmath25 in @xmath29 will be denoted as @xmath31 .",
    "the union of events transforms a test @xmath29 into a new test @xmath32 which is a * coarse - graining * of @xmath29 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "vice - versa , we will call @xmath29 a * refinement * of @xmath32 .",

    ", the marginal over entry @xmath25 does generally depend on the past test @xmath43 .",
    "such asymmetry of the joint probability under marginalization over future or past tests represents _ the choice of the arrow of time_. of course one could have assumed the opposite postulate of no - signaling from the past , considering conditioning from the future instead , thus reversing the arrow of time .",
    "postulate nsf introduces conditioning from tests , and is part of the definition itself of temporal cascade - tests .",
    "the need of considering nsf as a postulate has been noticed for the first time by masanao ozawa ( private communication ) . ]",

    "notice that operationally a transformation @xmath25 is completely specified by all the joint probabilities in which it is involved , whence , it is univocally given by the probability rule @xmath50 for all states @xmath35 .",

    "we will identify a * system * @xmath54 with a collection of * tests * @xmath55 , the collection being operationally closed under coarse - graining , convex combination , conditioning , and cascading , and will includes all states as special tests .",

    "the system would then correspond to a `` language '' ( see ref.@xcite for a similar framework ) .",

    "since we will consider always the closure under all operator s options ( this is our _ operational closure _ ) , we will take the system also to be closed under such convex combination .",
    "in particular , the set of all states of the system is closed under convex combinations and under conditioning , and we will denote by @xmath62 ( @xmath63 for short ) the convex set of all possible states of system @xmath54 . we will often use the colloquialism `` for all possible states @xmath35 '' meaning @xmath64 , and we will do similarly for other operational objects .    in the following",

    "theoretical physics should be , in essence , a mathematical `` representation '' of reality . by `` representation ''",
    "we mean to describe one thing by means of another , to connect the object that we want to understand  the _ thing - in - itself_with an object that we already know well  the _ standard_. in theoretical physics we lay down morphisms from structures of reality to corresponding mathematical structures : groups , algebras , vector spaces , _ etc .",
    "_ , each mathematical structure capturing a different side of reality .",
    "qm somehow goes differently .",
    "we have a beautiful simple mathematical structure ",
    "hilbert spaces and operator algebras  with unprecedented predictive power in the entire physical domain .",
    "however , we do nt have morphisms from the operational structure of reality into a mathematical structure . in this sense",
    "we can say that qm is not yet truly a `` representation '' of reality .",
    "the large part of the formal structure of qm is a set of formal tools for describing the process of gathering information in any experiment , independently of the particular physics involved .",
    "it is mainly a kind of information theory , a theory about our knowledge of physical entities rather than about the entities themselves .",
    "if we strip off such informational part from the theory , what would be left should be the true general principle from which qm should be derived .    in the present work",
    "i have analyzed the possibility of deriving qm as the mathematical representation of a fair operational framework made of a set of rules which allows one to make predictions on future events on the basis of suitable tests .",
    "the two postulates nsf and pfaith need to be satisfied by an operational framework that is fair , the former in order to be able to make predictions based on present tests , the latter to allow calibrability of any test and preparability of any state .",
    "we have seen that all theories satisfying nsf admit a c@xmath0-algebra representation of events as linear transformations of complex effects .",
    "based on a very general notion of dynamical independence , all such theories are _ non - signaling_. the c@xmath0-algebra representation of events is just the informational part of the theory .",
    "we have then added postulate pfaith .",
    "postulate pfaith has been proved to be remarkably powerful , implying the local observability principle , the tensor - product structure for the linear spaces of states and effects , weak self - duality , and a list of features such as realization of all states as transformations of the marginal faithful state @xmath501 , locally indistinguishable ensembles of states corresponding to local observables_i.e .",
    "_ impossibility of bit commitment , and more .",
    "we have then explored a postulate dual to pfaith , postulate faithe for effects , thus deriving additional quantum features , such as teleportation .",
    "we feel that we are really close to qm : maybe we are already there and we only need to prove it ! all the consequences of these postulates need to be explored further .",
    "i have also reported some consequences of a postulate about the purifiability of all states . in any case",
    ", we have seen that whichever is the missing postulate , it must establish a one - to - one correspondence between complex effects and atomic transformations , which , assuming atomicity of evolution ( postulate ae ) will make also effects a c@xmath0-algebra .",
    "this is what is special about qm ( and all hybrid quantum - classical theories ) , and will exclude the other non - signaling probabilistic theories of the kind of the pr - boxes .",
    "we have seen that the correspondence between effects and atomic transformations is established by the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism , which is hoped to be not too far from an operational principle .",
    "the present research program started in august 2003 in evanston il at northwestern university , where it continued during many following visits , far from the distractions of normal life , thanks to the generous hospitality of horace yuen . during these years",
    "the work has benefited of feedback and encouragement from many authors and colleagues at various conferences , where preliminary results were presented , most frequently at vaxj and perimeter , but also at meetings in losini , zurich , tokyo , sendai , cambridge uk , obergurgl , and leiden .",
    "in particular the present manuscript was initiated in cambridge uk thanks to the hospitality of robert spekkens in occasion of the workshop _",
    "operational probabilistic theories as foils to quantum theory _ , july 2 - 13 , 2007 , and was finished in nagoya thanks to the hospitality of masanao ozawa in march 2009 .",
    "i acknowledge useful discussions with numerous interested fellows , especially with dirk schlingeman , tony short , ray streater , chris fuchs , marcus appleby , karl svozil , gregg jaeger , lucien hardy , and valuable encouragement at the very beginning from maria luisa dalla chiara , enrico beltrametti , guido bacciagaluppi and jos uffink .",
    "i m most grateful to my talented disciples giulio chiribella and paolo perinotti for pointing out errors in the previous versions of the manuscript , and for numerous suitable advices .",
    "the work has also greatly gained from a thorough discussion with alexander wilce , howard barnum , and reinhard werner held in obergurgl during qics workshop on _ foundational structures for quantum information and computation _ september 14 - 20 , 2008 .",
    "finally , i m indebted with masanao ozawa and reinhard werner for consistently supporting this research and following its progress , with deep analysis and very useful suggestions .",
