    "gu botis is a nearby , low - mass detached eclipsing binary system , consisting of two nearly equal mass m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is one of currently very few known nearby ( @xmath1 200 pc ) double - lined , detached eclipsing binary ( deb ) systems composed of two low - mass companions @xcite .",
    "eclipsing binaries can be used as tools to constrain fundamental stellar properties such as mass , linear radius , and effective temperature .",
    "given the fact that over 70% of the stars in the milky way are low - mass objects with @xmath2 @xcite , coupled with the considerable uncertainty over the mass - radius relation for low - mass stars , objects such a gu botis are of particular interest in exploring the low - mass end of the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the characterization of the effects of limb darkening and star spots introduces free parameters and thus statistical uncertainty in the calculation of the stellar radii and masses . using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , we obtained 24 @xmath0 m time series observations of three separate instances of gu boo s secondary eclipse ( see table 1 ) to create a light curve far enough in the infrared to not be contaminated by the effects of limb darkening and star spots .",
    "a further goal of our study is to characterize the photometric stability of the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) on _ spitzer _ at 24 @xmath0 m over short and long time scales .",
    "time - series observing is atypical ( albeit increasingly common ) for _ spitzer _ which is the reason why there are very few published photometric light curves based on _ spitzer _ observations",
    ". the recent spectacular observations of primary and secondary eclipses of transiting planets are notable exception ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of these , the @xcite study was performed at 24 @xmath0 m . we therefore observed two consecutive secondary eclipses of gu boo about 12 hours apart ( observing sets 1 and 2 ) , and then a third event about six weeks later ( observing set 3 ) .",
    "table 1 gives an overview .",
    "we describe our mips-24 observations and data reduction procedure in  2 , present our results concerning gu boo s light curve and the photometric stability of _ spitzer _ and mips-24 in  3 , and summarize in  4 .",
    "we used mips-24 aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite to observe gu botis in february and april of 2006 , as outlined in table 1 .",
    "mips-24 , the 24 @xmath0 m array , is a si : as detector with 128 @xmath3 128 pixels , an image scale of 2.55 \" pixel@xmath4 , and a field of view of 5.4 @xmath3 5.4 @xcite .",
    "our exposures were obtained using the standard mips 24 @xmath0 m small field photometry pattern ( for details , see , for instance , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our goal was to observe three independent secondary eclipses of gu boo : two consecutive ones and another one several weeks after the first two .",
    "of our total of nine of _ spitzer s _ astronomical observation requests ( aors ) , three were used for each secondary eclipse event ( see table 1 ) .",
    "each aor contained eight observing cycles with 36 individual exposures each .",
    "the first exposure in each cycle is 9s long , the subsequent 35 are 10s long .",
    "the first two exposures of every cycle were discarded due to a `` first frames effect '' .",
    "this procedure left 34 frames per cycle , 272 frames per aor , 816 frames per secondary eclipse event , and 2448 frames for the entire project ( all 10s exposure time ) .",

    "the _ spitzer _ software package @xcite was used for co - adding the individual mips frames into mosaics of 17 frames , using overlap correction and outlier rejection in the process .",
    "the choice of 17 frames was made ( 1 ) to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a measured stellar flux density in a resulting combined image and subsequent data point in the respective star s light curves , ( 2 ) to maintain a sufficiently high effective observing cadence to temporally resolve elements of gu boo s light curve , and ( 3 ) not to be forced to combine frames from different cycles into a single light curve data point ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the interpolated , remapped mosaics have a pixel scale of 2.45  pixel@xmath4 .",
    "we show in figure [ mosaic_aor ] the mips-24 field of view of gu botis .    for photometric reductions of the mosaiced images",
    ", we utilized the component of to perform point - source extraction as described in @xcite .",
    "this step included background subtraction of the images , and the fitting of a resampled point response function ( prf ) , derived from our own data . in order to match the prf centroid as closely as possible to the centroid of the stellar profile ,",
    "the first airy ring was initially subtracted from the stellar profile , and detection was then performed on the resulting image .",
    "we show in fig . [ lightcurve ]",
    "the phased light curve of gu boo . based on preliminary light curve fitting to the relative flux density levels ( scaled to magnitudes ) shown in figure [ lightcurve ]",
    ", we find that our results are consistent with the system parameters derived from the optical study of the system in @xcite .",
    "the orbital period and initial epoch of the primary eclipse were set to the values given in the ephemerides equation derived by @xcite .",
    "we further fixed the mass ratio and the radius ratio of the stars , as well as the eccentricity of the system ( @xmath5=0 ) to the values obtained in that work .",
    "we assumed no limb darkening effects in the light curves , as expected for observations that far into the infrared ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and no significant gravitational darkening or reflection effects , based on the spherical shape of the stars and the similarity in effective temperatures .",
    "all these are reasonable assumptions , based on the results of the study of gu boo at visible wavelengths , and they are in fact hard to test in detail , given the photometric precision of the _ spitzer _ light curve at this flux density level .",
    "table 2 gives our estimates of gu boo s system parameters .",
    "lr parameter & value +    orbital period ( days ) & @xmath6 + orbital eccentricity & 0 ( fixed ) + mass ratio ( m2/m1 ) & @xmath7 + radius of secondary component ( @xmath8 ) & 0.66 @xmath9 0.02 ( 0.62 ) + orbital inclination @xmath10 ( degrees ) & 89.3 @xmath9 0.8 ( 87.6 ) +      figure [ global_rms ] shows the fractional rms around median values for all objects with more than 72 out of a total of 144 observational epochs for each individual observing set as well as for the three sets combined . observing sets 1 and 2 were obtained during the mips006500 campaign , observing set 3 during mips006700 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we find that inter - set repeatability of _",
    "spitzer s _",
    "mips-24 is comparable to its repeatability within a set , both in terms of median flux density level as well as rms values . for the objects with a flux density in excess of 1 mjy , the rms values approach the 14 % level .",
    "the light curves of all objects in the field ( other than gu boo itself ) are flat with different amounts of random scatter around the median flux density level .",
    "we used mips-24 onboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ to obtain time - series photometry of the m - dwarf deb gu boo .",
    "our observations cover three secondary eclipse events , two consecutive ones and a further event six weeks later .",
    "our mid - ir analysis of gu boo s light curve is less affected by stellar surface features than its optical counterpart .",
    "the results show good agreement with the previously obtained system parameters based on optical and near - ir work . finally , we find that the repeatability of mips-24 photometry is consistent over all temporal scales we sampled : within an observing set and on time scales of 24 hours and six weeks .",
