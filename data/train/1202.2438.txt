    "the differential cross section of elastic scattering of p+p collisions allows one to study the internal structure of protons using the theory of diffraction . varying the momentum transfer",
    "one can change the resolution of the investigation : increasing the momentum transfer corresponds to looking more and more deeply inside the structure of protons .",
    "one of the fundamental outcomes of diffractive p+p scattering studies was the indication that protons have a finite size and a complicated internal structure , thus the protons can be considered as composite objects .",
    "our interest in this problem has been triggered by two factors : an interesting series of recent theoretical work and also new data from the totem experiment at cern lhc .",
    "these are detailed below .",
    "recently , we became aware of an inspiring series of papers of bialas , bzdak and collaborators , who studied elastic proton - proton  @xcite , pion - proton  @xcite and nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite,@xcite in a framework where the proton was considered as a composite object that contains correlated quark and diquark constituents . in this work",
    ", we confirm their main conclusion : the quark - diquark model of nucleon structure at low momentum transfer does capture the main features of this problem and indeed it deserves a closer , more detailed attention .",
    "this study is dedicated to a follow - up , more detailed investigation , not only including an estimation of the best values of the parameters , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also determining their errors and also the evaluation of the models based on an analysis of the presented fit quality . in order to reach these goals , we utilized standard experimental techniques , such as multi - parameter optimalization or fitting with the help of the minuit function minimalization and multi - parameter optimalization package  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these simple , straightforward and interesting theoretical investigations of elastic scattering data from cern isr in the energy range of @xmath2 23.5 , 30.7 , 52.9 and 62.5 gev , that were already analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , new elastic scattering data became available recently at @xmath1 tev  @xcite from the cern lhc experiment totem .",
    "so we have tested the model of bialas and bzdak not only at isr energies but also at the currently available highest lhc energies on recent totem data , in order to learn more details about the evolution of the properties of p+p elastic interactions in the recently opened , few tev energy range .",
    "most of the arguments for the composite structure of hadrons have been derived from the studies of lepton - hadron interactions .",
    "the emerging standard picture is that hadrons are either mesons , composed of valence quarks and anti - quarks , or ( anti)baryons , composed of three valence ( anti)quarks , that carry the quantum numbers , while the electrically neutral gluons carry color charges and provide the binding among the quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the exact contribution of quarks , gluons , and the sea of virtual quark - antiquark pairs and gluons to certain hadronic properties e.g. spin is still under detailed investigation .",
    "for example , the gluon contribution to the proton spin is still not fully constrained  @xcite .",
    "also , more than 10 exotic hadronic resonances called x , y and z states were recently discovered in electron - positron collisions at the world s highest luminosities in the belle experiment at kek .",
    "these hadronic states can not be interpreted in the standard picture of quark - antiquark or three ( anti)quark bound states , according to refs .",
    "@xcite thus even nowadays there are still several open questions that are related to the compositeness of the hadrons in general .",
    "as gluons do not interact with directly with leptons , their properties are best explored with the help of the strong hadronic interactions .",
    "for example , the gluon contribution to the proton spin is investigated with the help of polarized proton - polarized proton collisions at rhic  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the effects of internal correlations between the quarks inside the protons , examining in detail proton - proton elastic scattering at several isr and also at the currently maximal available lhc energies .",
    "let us recall , that a similar analysis involving three independent quarks was not able to properly describe the isr data  @xcite . in that model quarks were considered as `` dressed '' valence quarks in the sense that they contain the gluonic and @xmath3 contribution as well , as if the glue would be concentrated around pointlike valence quarks .",
    "30 years after the three independent quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite another three - quark model of the protons was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that included interesting correlations between two dressed valence quarks to form a diquark .",
    "this quark - diquark model  @xcite , is the basis of our current study , in order to examine in details proton - proton elastic scattering at isr and lhc energies .",
    "the quark - diquark picture of elastic p+p scattering resembles to the glauber optical model  @xcite in nuclear physics , where a multiple expansion is applied .",
    "the glauber model , developed originally for nuclear multiple scattering problems like cross sections of protons and neutrons on deuteron , became a standard model of high energy interactions in nuclear physics where multiple interactions are built up from superpositions of nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "this model became a fundamental and successfull tool in describing nuclear collisions at high energy  @xcite .",
    "the body of this manuscript is organized as follows : the theoretical models are described in section [ sec : theory ] , for both cases , when the diquark acts as a single entity and also when it acts as a composite object . in section",
    "[ sec : reproduction ] the original results of bialas and bzdak are reproduced and detailed , including a note on the quality of these data descriptions .",
    "section [ sec : minuit ] contains our main new results , the first minuit results .",
    "the conclusion takes place in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we describe proton - proton interactions as collision of two systems , each one composed of a dressed quark and diquark . the collision is schematically illustrated on fig .",
    "[ scattering sit1 ] .        the interaction between quarks and diquarks is assumed to be purely absorptive .",
    "consequently the amplitude has no real part and the imaginary part  dominating at high energy  is given by the absorption of the incoming particle wave , namely the inelastic ( non - diffractive ) collisions .    in the impact parameter space",
    "the inelastic proton - proton cross - section for a fixed impact parameter @xmath4 can be given by the following formula @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the transverse positions of the quarks and diquarks respectively , and the integrand is the probability function of having inelastic interaction at a given impact parameter @xmath4 and transverse positions of the constituents .    the quark - diquark distribution inside the nucleon is taken into account with the following gaussian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the `` proton size '' , the variance of the distribution and @xmath12 is the mass ratio of the quark and the diquark .",
    "obviously @xmath13 , where @xmath14 would indicate a loosely bound diquark .",
    "the two dimensional delta function preserves the center of mass in the tranverse plane .",
    "elastic interactions of the constituents are _ independent _ inside the proton , accordingly the probability distribution of elastic proton - proton collision is the _ product _ of the probability distribution of elastic interactions of the constituents @xcite @xmath15 the inelastic differential cross - sections are parametrized with gaussian distributions @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the variance of having an inelastic collision , which is calculated from the sum of the squared @xmath18 , @xmath19 radius parameters ; the @xmath20 parameters are the ampitudes . from unitarity the elastic amplitude in impact parameter space @xmath21",
    "the elastic amplitude in momentum transfer representation is the fourier - transform of the amplitude in impact parameter space @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the zeroth bessel - function of the first kind",
    ". then the elastic differential cross section reads as @xmath26      the subject of this section is to analyse that case when the quark and diquark radii are independent model parameters , which means that the diquark is considered as one entity as indicated on fig .",
    "[ scattering sit1 ] . in this case , the number of free parameters can be reduced if we assume that the number of partons is twice as many in the diquark than in the quark . from the inelastic differential cross sections ( [ inelastic cross sections ] )",
    "the total inelastic cross sections are @xmath27 our assumption tells us that @xmath28 from which we can deduce the following expressions @xmath29 which means that every @xmath20 parameter can be expressed in term of @xmath30 . with these ingredients",
    "the calculation of ( [ elsoegyenlet ] ) reduces to gaussian integrations .",
    "the general or master formula for these gaussian integrals is given in the appendix .",
    "in the next two subsections the elastic proton - proton data analysis are presented in the case when the diquark is assumed to have no internal , more detailed structure in elastic collisions .",
    "first , we demonstrate with plots that we reproduce the results of the original paper at isr energies @xcite .",
    "this forms a solid basis for imrovement as presented in the subsequent parts of our current study .",
    "our minuit fits are then presented , utilizing same isr data and then the new results are presented at @xmath31 tev utilizing new data of the totem experiment  @xcite .",

    "if the diquark has the internal structure ( [ quarkdistribution ] ) then the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 inelastic differential cross sections ( [ inelastic cross sections ] ) can be calculated from @xmath39 using an expansion analogous to expression ( [ glauber expansion ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath36 and @xmath38 are the following @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 the relevant formula to calculate the inelastic cross section of eq.([elsoegyenlet ] ) is again obtained from the expressions summarized in the appendix .",

    "the ratios are slightly different from ( [ isrratios ] ) @xmath54 which shows that the shadowing is stronger , 6.5% and 16% percent respectively .",
    "the total elastic scattering cross sections were also determined , as given in table [ tableqq ] .",
    "note , that the errors on the total cross - section have not yet been obtained reliably at this point .",
    "the reason is that the errors of total cross - sections are very strongly correlated with the errors of @xmath30 .",

    "a systematic study of fit quality as well as the fit parameters under similar circumstances has been performed for the bialas - bzdak model in a wide energy range from isr to lhc energies . the model gives a good description of the isr data , which means that the cl is acceptable on the isr energies if 3 data points at the dip were left out from the fit .",
    "the total proton - proton cross section ( `` size '' of the proton ) clearly seems to grow with energy but the model fails at this energy domain as cl is not acceptable at @xmath31 tev .",
    "this preliminary result does not include systematics , and the correlation between the fit parameters are still under investigation .",
    "an important shortcoming of the quark - diquark model of protons is that it ignores the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "this leads to a singular behaviour at the diffractive minimum , which is apparently a more and more serious model limitation with increasing the energy of the p+p collisions .",
    "the evaluated ratios of the quark - quark , quark - diquark and diquark - diquark total inelastic cross - sections were found to deviate more and more from the ideal 1 : 2 : 4 ratio with increasing energies . in the isr energy range the deviations from this ideal value were not yet significant , indicating lack of significant shadowing effects .",
    "however at the current lhc energy of @xmath1 tev , a significant decrease compared to these ideal ratios were found , which possibly may indicate an increased role of shadowing at cern lhc energies .",
    "the final conclusions of this study will be summarized separately and submitted for a publication .",
    "the current status corresponds to the level of our understanding around september 2011 , at the time of the 2011 summer school on diffraction in heidelberg , where these results were first presented .",
    "finally let us note that the totem collaboration extended recently the measurement of the differential elastic p+p scattering cross - sections to low values of @xmath49 in ref .",
    "@xcite , allowing one to extrapolate to the optical point at @xmath55 and to determine the total elastic and the total scattering cross - sections of p+p collisions at @xmath1 tev for the first time , but these data were yet not utilized in our analysis .    as a final remark ,",
    "at the time of the completion of this conference contribution it is inspiring to see the great theoretical interest in the differential elastic cross - section measurement of totem at lhc , as evidenced by the increasing amount of theoretical interpretations and successfull descriptions of certain aspects of these data . as our contribution",
