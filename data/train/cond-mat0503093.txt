    "since the 1980s , laser induced wet chemical etching in silicon , ceramics , and metals has been an intensively used micro - structuring technique @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) , a focused laser beam induces an etching reaction enhanced by a coaxial jet of etchant producing holes and kerfs on metallic samples within a micrometer scale .    this technique",
    "is called _ laser induced jet - chemical etching _ ( lje ) and has been successful in fabricating superelastic microgrippers of nickel - titanium alloy . however , within a certain range of parameters , in the microstructuring of kerfs on stainless steel surfaces with a solution of @xmath0 , unwanted periodic ripples appear . in this paper , it is considered that these ripples are intrinsically generated and belong to a wide universality class of pattern formation phenomena that emerge , for example , in ripple structures formed by wind over a sand bed , ion sputtering of various surfaces @xcite and abrasive water - jet cutting @xcite .    in the context of ion sputtering , cuerno , makse , tommassone , harrington and stanley ( cmths )",
    "proposed a stochastic one dimensional ( 1d ) discrete solid - on - solid ( sos ) model based on the competition between erosion and surface diffusion processes in which ripples appear at early stages of the evolution @xcite .",
    "we have extended and adapted the cmths model for the lje case taking into account a moving gaussian - distributed laser beam which leads to a localized heating and etching of the metallic sample . the motivation to use such a phenomenological model",
    "is originated from the limited knowledge of the interaction of diverse processes occurring in a wide range of scales .",
    "the dynamics of the laser light absorption , heat , chemical reactions , hydrodynamics , and transport phenomena is too complex to be fully modelled .",
    "while this _ extended model _ is quite simple , it nevertheless captures essential physical effects of the process , such as the unstable temperature driven etching and the stabilizing mechanism of surface diffusion .",

    "the microstructuring of the samples is achieved by an argon ion cw - laser beam at 514 nm embedded coaxially in a jet of liquid etchant which is directed perpendicularly to the surface .",

    "the laser induced etching leads to dissolution of the metal and formation of hydrogen .",
    "simultaneously , changes of the state of the electrode from passive to active produce an electrochemical potential and its temporal evolution @xmath3 can be measured against an ag / agcl reference electrode , which is immersed in the etching reservoir .",
    "the etching cell is mounted on a computer - controlled mobile basis which allows us to move the sample in the @xmath4-plane with respect to the laser beam with different feed velocities @xmath5 [ see fig . [",
    "fig : exp_setup](b ) ] .",
    "the setup is automated allowing us to structure holes or kerfs varying the most relevant external parameters : laser power , etchant jet velocity , feed velocity , and etchant concentration .",
    "details of the process can be observed with a ccd camera located above the etching cell in the same axis of the laser beam .",
    "alternatively , by means of a photoresistance located in the same position , measurements of the intensity of the reflected light can be used together with the electrochemical potential for monitoring the etching dynamics .      under normal conditions of temperature",
    ", the layer in contact with the liquid is passivated spontaneously thus isolating the metallic sample from the etchant action .",
    "the area below the laser spot is heated and almost immediately the heat spreads to a wider zone . above a temperature threshold the passivation layer is removed and thermally activated chemical etching starts there forming the _ etching front _ which structures the kerf on the surface at velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the protons of the phosphoric acid ( @xmath0 ) react with the iron , nickel , and chromium of the steel producing hydrogen and dissolution of metal ions .",
    "the basic reactions can be described as @xmath6 @xmath7 with similar reactions for the ionization of the nickel and chromium .",
    "the etching reaction is exothermic in nature .",
    "when the etching reaction dissolves the metal and consumes the etchant , a thin layer of solution in contact with the metallic surface develops a concentration gradient ranging from zero on the surface to the value of the bulk concentration .",
    "this is called the _ nernst diffusion layer _ ( ndl ) and within its thickness @xmath8 , the transport of ions of etchant and reaction products of the reactions occurs exclusively by diffusion , limiting the etching reaction @xcite .",
    "outside this layer , convective transport maintains the concentration uniform at the bulk concentration .",
    "the value of @xmath8 depends on the hydrodynamic conditions imposed by the etchant jet .",
    "the ndl is not directly modelled in this work .",
    "we assume that its thickness @xmath8 is almost negligible compared with the dimensions of the simulated topographies .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the role of the nernst diffusion layer is indeed essential in the real etching process .",
    "variations of the dynamics of the jet due to its interaction with the surface can affect the value of the thickness @xmath8 and in consequence , the transport of ions and reaction products .",
    "for example , if in a trough of a ripple the turbulence of the etchant flow allows a growing thickness @xmath8 , this would imply a strong inhibition of the etching rate after a certain depth threshold .    in experiments of wet - chemical etching of ceramics ( without etchant jet ) , lu _ et al . _",
    "have found that the diffusive transport in the ndl is the main limiting factor of the etching rate @xcite .",
    "following their analysis and assuming that the etching rate decreases exponentially with the depth , an expression for the dependency of the etched depth with the feed velocity has been found to be in good agreement with experimental data for the lje experiment using @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the function of the etchant jet is to enhance the etching rates reducing the ndl thickness @xmath8 , to provide fresh etchant and to remove dissolved material and reaction products .",
    "in addition , the jet creates a cooling effect that maintains the heating effect of the laser spot concentrated in a small region .",
    "therefore the de - passivated zone and the resulting etching are highly localized . when the etchant jet velocity is increased the etching reaction",
    "is favored due to more fresh etchant but on the other hand it is inhibited due to the cooling effect .",
    "after the laser jet leaves a region the surface is repassivated due to the decrease of the temperature and its topography will remain unaltered .",
    "in most cases the etching front is stationary and the obtained kerf has , apart from small fluctuations , a defined shape with almost constant width and depth . the bottom and",
    "walls of the kerfs are rough due to the stochastic character of the etching reactions . on the other hand , for certain parameters ranges of feed velocity , laser beam power , or etchant jet velocity , oscillations of the etching front producing periodic ripples",
    "have been reported @xcite . here",
    "we will analyze the series of experiments with increasing power and a constant feed velocity @xmath10 m/s shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_series ] .",
    "there are two external sources which produce periodic structures that can be detected in the measurements for stationary etching fronts .",
    "first , the peristaltic pump introduces vibrations in the etchant jet in the range of 1 - 3hz that can be detected in the power spectra of the electrochemical potential time series , which correspond to periodic surface structures smaller than @xmath11 m . second , the @xmath4 stage has an internal mechanism that controls its position every @xmath12 m , resulting in small oscillations in the feed velocity @xmath5 around a mean value . nevertheless , the frequencies corresponding to the examined ripples are incommensurable with the frequencies of both the etchant pump and the controlling mechanism of the @xmath4 stage . in consequence these can be discarded as external triggers of the obtained ripples .    from the point of view of the theory of pattern formation in continuous media , the appearance of ripples originated from instabilities is not unexpected because the etching front is formed in a system far from equilibrium due to the continuous and combined action of the laser beam and the etchant jet . in general ,",
    "one class of mechanisms for such instabilities arises from the existence of constraints and conservation laws in the system @xcite . in the case of water",
    "jet cutting , at high feed rates intrinsically generated ripples and striation patterns of the _ order _ of the water jet diameter are formed at the side walls of the cut ( see ref .",
    "this fact has been used there as a criterion to distinguish between ripples triggered externally from the intrinsic ones .    reproduced from rabbow @xcite .",
    "optical microscope images showing a series of kerfs structured with increasing powers from 250 to 650 mw ( etchant 5-m @xmath13 , feed velocity @xmath14 m/s , etchant jet velocity 190 cm / s ) .",
    "the kerfs for 250 , 300 , and 350 mw are the result of a uniform etching front which widens with power . for powers greater than 350 mw , an instability in the etching front comes in , and the obtained ripples seem to be product of a thermal runaway .",
    "a hypothesis on the intrinsic character of the ripples and some remarks on the mechanism that is creating this pulsating etching front are discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=48.2% ]    the diameter of the etching front is not always constant for the lje experiment .",
    "certainly , more delivered power means higher temperatures and , although the laser spot diameter remains the same , the etching front become wider . for laser powers",
    "250 , 300 , and 350 mw an approximately stationary etching front produces kerfs with increasing width and depth ( see first three kerfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_series ] ) .    for powers larger than 350",
    "mw an instability appears producing ripples with increasing length and width .",
    "the ripples look like a product of thermal runaways which reach much broader areas than in the stationary etching front case .",
    "each thermal runaway seems to appear above a temperature threshold , producing a quick broadening of the etching front .",
    "the broadening stops when the accelerated consumption of etchant inhibits further etching rates and the etching front shrinks until the conditions for the onset of the next thermal runaway are fulfilled . note that during the ripple formation the absorption of laser radiation is also changing according to variations of the slope of the etching front .",
    "probably this has a reinforcing effect on the pulsating etching front .",
    "based on these facts we formulate the hypothesis that above a power threshold an instability creates ripples .",
    "the resulting wavelength is in the order of magnitude of the diameter of the stationary etching front that would appear if the mechanism that causes the instability would not act .",
    "this could explain why the ripple length increases with the power . for powers",
    "larger than 600 mw the ripples seem to overlap as the kerfs become deeper .",
    "instead of formulating a microscopical model with the interaction of all possible chemical and physical processes , we propose a minimal phenomenological description of the etching process based on some ideas of the theory of far from equilibrium evolving surfaces .",
    "a number of discrete growth models and continuum stochastic equations have been proposed to describe the kinetic roughening properties of surface growth and erosion @xcite . for simulating the structures produced by the lje technique , we have extended and adapted a stochastic 1d discrete solid - on - solid ( sos ) model proposed by cuerno _",
    "@xcite for the evolution of ion sputtered surfaces ( cmths model ) . within that framework",
    "they explain two stages : an early time regime characterized by ripples and late time regime where the roughening shows self - affine scaling behavior .",
    "it has been shown that this model is related with a noisy version of the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation , which has been used extensively in the theory of unstable pattern formation @xcite .",

    "( c ) , ( d ) : diffusive movements . the probability of surface diffusion in ( c ) is close to 1 , while for ( d ) it is very small according to a mechanism for creating a positive surface tension described in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion_rule].,scaledwidth=48.2% ]    a remarkable feature in experiments of ion sputtering is the presence of nearly periodic ripples , aligned parallel or perpendicular to the bombarding ion beam @xcite . relating the energy of the ion beam with sputtering yield , bradley and harper ( bh ) @xcite found that the dependency of the erosion rate with the local surface curvature induces an instability , which is responsible for the formation of periodic ripples with a characteristic length .",
    "troughs are eroded faster than peaks and this effect can be considered as a negative surface tension , \" which competes with the smoothing mechanism of thermally activated surface diffusion ( which is a positive surface tension ) .",
    "our extended model is based on similar mechanism and the justification for applying it to ripples found in lje is based on experimental evidence that shows that troughs are preferentially etched as compared to peaks .",
    "this can be explained as consequence of differences in the absorption of laser energy and the resulting heat processes .",
    "first , when the laser beam is acting on a trough , due to the geometry the reflected rays converge to the zone above the trough and eventually can produce multiple reflections inside .",
    "this means that the trough and its neighborhood can effectively absorb more laser radiation , more heat is produced , and in consequence the etching rate is enhanced . in the case of peaks reflected rays",
    "are dispersed in all directions and there are no secondary reflections .",
    "on the other hand , considering the cooling effect of the etchant jet due to heat convection , it is easy to imagine that peaks are cooled more efficiently than troughs where eddies and even stagnation of the fluid are more probable to appear",
    ". then , the preferential heating and etching within troughs result in further increase of the local curvature , which in turn enhances the secondary reflections and heating due to poorer convective heat transport by the etchant flow .",
