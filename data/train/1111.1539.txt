    "the blazar oj287 shows an interesting light curve where optical outbursts follow each other in roughly a 12 yr sequence ( sillanp et al .",
    "the light curve has two significant periodicities , the 12 yr period as well as a 60 yr period ( valtonen et al .",
    "the simplest explanation of such a doubly periodic system is that it is a binary black hole ( bbh ) system ( katz 1997 ) where the accretion disk of the primary is perturbed by a companion on a 12 yr orbit , while the larger period represents a precession cycle .",
    "sundelius et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented a detailed study of this case , and noted that the disk is tidally perturbed during the close encounters .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the tidal perturbations affect the accretion flow , and thus create a 12 yr pattern of increased brightness .",
    "the model of sundelius et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the massive central black hole lies in the centre of the accretion disc .",
    "the jet emanating from the black hole ( not drawn in the figure ) is taken to be perpendicular to the disc .    in the bbh model",
    "the primary is a massive black hole belonging to the upper end of the black hole mass function ( ghisellini et al .",

    "the host galaxy of oj287 is bright , @xmath0 ( wright et al .",
    "the primary mass of @xmath1 solar mass places oj287 almost exactly on the black hole mass - host galaxy magnitude relation extended from smaller galaxies and black holes ( kormendy & bender 2011 ) . the secondary moves in an eccentric orbit of eccentricity @xmath2 , and",
    "it impacts the accretion disc of the primary twice during its 12 yr orbit .",
    "the impact points vary from orbit to orbit , and by studying this variation one may determine the rate of the relativistic precession and other parameters of the orbit ( valtonen 2007 ) .",
    "the flares arising from disc impacts are easily recognised by the sudden rise of the optical flux and by their generally short duration in comparison with tidal outbursts ( valtonen et al . 2008a , 2009 ) .",
    "the mass of the secondary black hole is @xmath3 solar mass , small enough that the accretion disc remains stable in spite of the repeated impacts .",
    "the accretion disc is modeled as a magnetic @xmath4 disc of sakimoto & coroniti ( 1981 ) .",
    "the binary orbit is taken to be nearly perpendicular to the plane of the disc ; therefore the jet ( not illustrated in figure  1 ) lies close to the binary plane .",
    "the future optical light curve of oj287 was predicted from 1996 to 2030 ; during the first fifteen years oj287 has followed the prediction with amazing accuracy , producing five outbursts at expected times , of expected light curve profile and size ( valtonen et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this theory",
    "the orbit solution of lehto @xmath5 valtonen ( 1996 ) was used , but because sundelius et al .",
    "( 1997 ) use a live disc model , the disk is lifted up by the approaching secondary ( ivanov et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the outbursts related to impacts happen earlier than expected in a rigid disc model .",
    "for example , in the live disc model the 2005 disk impact is about 6 months ahead of the impact in the rigid disc model , and thus the 2006 april outburst is shifted to 2005 october , as was subsequently observed ( valtonen et al .",
    "2006b,2008b ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate another property of a live accretion disc , the change of its orientation as a function of the phase of the binary orbit . since the changes in the disc orientation are small , sundelius et al . ( 1997 ) did not make an effort to calculate them .",
    "the model calculations are then compared with the historical vlbi data of the parsec scale jet orientation as well as with the optical polarization data collected by villforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , as it is possible that the changing disc orientation is reflected in the orientation of the jet .",
    "the jet orientation , in turn , may affect the direction of polarization in the optical emission of the jet .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the variation of the position angle of polarization in oj287 , as this is a quantity which may be modeled in the sundelius et al .",
    "( 1997 ) framework .",
    "the data have been published and are illustrated in figure 14 of villforth et al .",
    "they include data points both from the authors own campaign from 2005 to 2009 , and earlier measurements . from the point of view of our theory",
    ", we are interested in the long term behaviour of the mean polarization angle . therefore we take averages per each calendar year .",
    "they are listed in column 2 of table 1 , together with the standard deviation of the scatter per calendar year in column 3 .",
    "the last two columns give the number of observations used and the standard error of the mean ( columns 4 and 5 , respectively ) .",

    "unfortunately it is impossible to resolve the optical jet , but at radio wavelengths the jet is observable in parsec scale with the vlbi and its orientation is known since the early 1980s .",
    "we have constructed the observed history of variations in the position angle of oj287 s radio jet by collecting the available vlbi data from the literature .",
    "the jet pa was defined as the mean pa within the first one milliarcsecond ( mas ) from the vlbi core , which is the bright feature at one end of the jet .",
    "the mean pa was measured by fitting an ordinary - least - squares bisector regression line to the jet component positions if more than one such component was present within 1mas from the core .",
    "the regression line was forced to go through the core position and the each component was assigned a positional uncertainty equivalent to 10% of the component s size convolved with the beam size ( see lister et al .",
    "2009a ) . in the least - squares",
    "fit the data points were weighted by the inverse square of their positional uncertainty times the component s ( normalized ) flux density .",
    "if only one component was present within 1mas from the core , the pa of this knot was assumed as the jet pa .",
    "table  2 lists 140 individual jet pa measurements obtained in this manner and covering a time period from 1981 to 2009 .",
    "these observations were made at 2 , 3.6 , and 6 cm wavelengths .",
    "we chose these wavelengths because within this range the jet pa seems to be very weakly wavelength - dependent , and because there are abundant historical data available through the geodetic observations ( 3.6 cm ) and the vlba 2 cm / mojave surveys ( kellermann et al .",
    "1998,lister et al",
    ". 2009a ) .",
    "we did not try to back - extrapolate the ejection epochs of the knots , since it easily leads to ambiguous results for inhomogeneous data sets with time gaps .",
    "the proper motions close to the core in oj287 are @xmath10masyr@xmath11 meaning that we measure the changes in the pa with a delay of @xmath12yr ( lister et al .",
    "2009a ) .",
    "figure  5 presents the long - term evolution of the vlbi jet s position angle .",
    "the values there are weighted annual means of @xmath13 cm measurements .",
    "the error bars represent either the standard deviation of the scatter in a given year ( multiple observations per year ) or the uncertainty of a single measurement .",
    "as mentioned earlier , stacking 2 , 3.6 , and 6 cm data together does not add a bias to the pa curve , since the average difference in ( quasi-)simultaneously measured pas between these wavelengths is close to zero .",
    "the projected jet pa presented in figure  5 varies with a total amplitude of @xmath14 degrees , it has an overall decreasing trend , and it shows two significant `` spikes '' separated by about a decade .",
    "tateyama & kingham 2004 have earlier reported a varying jet pa in oj287 and proposed that this may be due to the precession of a ballistic jet .",
    "comparison of figure  5 to figure  6 in @xcite shows , however , that this specific periodic model does not fit the observed variations in jet pa when data spanning three decades is considered .",
    "moor et al .",
    "( 2011 ) show another recent compilation of the pa data with a 12 yr cyclic structure together with the overall long term trend .",
    "the lines in figure  5 are the projected position angles in the sky calculated from our model .",
    "they have been drawn for the same parameter values as the lines in figure  4 , except that for the solid line the time delay @xmath15 is only 4 years .",
    "the free parameters here are the time delay and the zero point of the projected jet orientation . the 13 yr time delay model and",
    "the pa measurements agree in general outline , with the exception of the two earliest data points , which are from four - station experiments with the u.s .",
    "vlbi array .",
    "the poor @xmath16 coverage of these observations leaves the jet orientation more uncertain than in the rest of the data .",
    "the model predicts that the jet pa should rapidly turn clockwise by @xmath14 degrees within the next ten years .",
    "also , the model is coming to a minimum in the angle between the jet and our line - of - sight .",
    "as the viewing angle approaches the half - opening angle of the jet , the appearance of the vlbi jet can change significantly : the apparent opening angle increases , any bending is exacerbated , and differential doppler boosting may affect the observed structure .",
    "based on a sequence of 7 mm vlba images agudo et al .",
    "( 2010,2011 ) recently reported a greatly changed pa in the innermost part of oj287 s jet during 20082010 .",
    "they gave a new jet pa of @xmath17 or @xmath18 , depending on the identification of the core component .",
    "agudo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) propose that the jet is indeed crossing our line - of - sight and the sudden change in the pa may be due to a moving kink in the jet with an almost zero viewing angle .",
    "one can not , however , directly compare the pa values reported by them with those presented in figure  5 , since the pas given in agudo et al .",
    "( 2010,2011 ) refer to the mutual orientation of the two innermost bright features at 7 mm that are separated by only @xmath19mas , whereas the pas shown in figure  5 refer to the mean orientation of the jet within the first 1mas in the 2 - 6 cm images .",
    "therefore , further vlbi observations are needed to test if the predicted change in the jet orientation takes place .",
    "if the time delay turns out to be shorter than in the optical variations , it may imply that the information on the change of jet orientation is transmitted to the axis via the hot corona surrounding the accretion disk , with a speed of sound ( actually , alfven speed ) which is much greater than the sound speed in the disk .",
    "the value of @xmath20 does not enter this calculation .",
    "in the following we make the simplifying assumption that the symmetry axis of the magnetic field structure in the jet is at a constant angle relative to the jet axis .",
    "this basically requires either a reasonably stable vector - ordered magnetic field in the jet or a long - lived stationary shock in the region where the optical emission originates .",
    "thus when the jet points in different directions , so does the electric field vector of the oscillating electrons .",
    "consider first the case where the electric field vector is almost parallel to the jet .",
    "the electric field vector has its own viewing angle which is in general different from the viewing angle of the jet .",
    "let the plane which is perpendicular to the electric field vector be specified by angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will now consider determining these parameters when @xmath23 yr in the optical part of the jet .",
    "figure  6 shows the polarization angle data together with a fit to a model with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the jet and the electric field vector are at an angle of @xmath26 relative to each other .",
    "an almost parallel evpa with respect to the jet axis could be generated by a large - scale helical magnetic field with a dominant toroidal component or a compressed magnetic field of a long - lived ( oblique ) standing shock front in the jet ( see lyutikov et al .",
    "2005 for a discussion of jet polarization ) .",
    "however , there is a @xmath27 shift in the pa given by this model with respect to the best fit with observations .",
    "this leads us to another possibility , namely that the poloidal magnetic field component dominates in the section of the jet where the optical emission comes from . in that case the pa that we are plotting is the direction of the magnetic field , with a small but significant deviation from the jet line .",
    "then we should add @xmath27 to the pa values in our model in order to compare with the observed polarization angle ( laing 1981 , lyutikov et al .",
    "it is not possible to decide @xmath28 which case we should have in oj287 since it depends sensitively on the physical structure of the jet .",
    "however , it is generally thought that the optical emission arises rather close to the central engine ( e.g. agudo et al . 2011 ) . since the poloidal magnetic field component increases faster than the toroidal field component towards the centre , it is likely that in our case the poloidal field should dominate , and we should add @xmath27 to the pa values , as we do in figure 6 .",
    "we notice that the model describes well the general feature of the polarization angle evolution , noticed by villforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , that the position angle has changed in an almost steplike fashion from @xmath29 to @xmath30 in the early 1990 s .",
    "the prediction of the model is that this position angle should hold on during the coming decades .",
    "note that the model assumes optically thin conditions in the jet and thus the @xmath27 jump in pa around 1995 has nothing to do with the changes in optical depth . neither do we need a dramatic change of the magnetic field configuration in the jet at that time , as suggested by villforth et al .",
    "quite opposite , our model assumes a constancy of the jet , and looks only at the pa changes due to the changing viewing angle .    in some years",
    "the theoretical line goes well outside the error range of the annual average .",
    "we should note that especially in mid 1980 s the pa varied over the whole angular range even in one year ( see figure 14 of villforth et al 2010 ) , and the calculation of the average value is very sensitive to the @xmath31 ambiguity in the observed polarization angles .",
    "for example , by a different choice of the quadrant for just one or two observations , the position angles @xmath32 in 1971 , @xmath33 in 1984 , @xmath34 in 1985 , @xmath27 in 1986 and @xmath35 in 1994 can also be found . in all of these cases",
    "the correction goes to the direction of improving the fit with the theoretical line .",
    "however , for the other years such uncertainty does not exits , and the remaining difference with the theory must be considered real .",
    "we have also broken down the data in semi - annual boxes , but it does not help to clarify the situation with respect to the most uncertain points .    .",
    "the theoretical lines are shifted by adding @xmath27 ; there is a @xmath27 uncertainty in the polarization angle due to unknown physical conditions in the jet ( lyutikov et al .",
    "using a number of simplifying assumptions , we have calculated how the orientation of oj287 s relativistic jet is expected to vary in the binary black hole model of sundelius et al .",
    "even though the model does not include a detailed physical treatment of the jet / disk connection , it agrees with the observed radio jet orientation as well as optical polarization evolution of oj287 in general outline .",
    "the scatter in the polarization position angle is large which makes a very specific comparison difficult .",
    "the view which we have arrived at is that in many respects oj287 can be modeled as a binary system , a scaled up version of her x-1 or ss433 . in the presented model of oj287 ,",
    "the jet sweeps across the line of sight in a periodic manner , and this motion creates brightness variations by varying doppler boosting as well as shows up as a varying projection of the jet . while the projected radio jet is actually observed , in optical we gain evidence of the beam sweeping by the varying optical polarization angle .",
    "when the analytical model of katz ( 1997 ) is scaled up for the observed cycle frequencies , it explains well the numerical simulation results of this work .",
    "the presented model makes predictions about the future trends of the observables discussed in this paper and therefore it can be easily further tested by continuing the vlbi and polarization monitoring of oj287 .",
    "we would like to thank tuomas savolainen who has compiled the information in table 2 and has generously allowed us to use it .",
