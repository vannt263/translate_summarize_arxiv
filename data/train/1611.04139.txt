    "the triaxial shape has been a long - standing subject in nuclear physics .",
    "the appearance of the wobbling bands  @xcite and the chiral doublet bands  @xcite has provided unambiguous experimental evidence of triaxiality .",
    "the wobbling mode was first proposed by bohr and mottelson in the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "it exists in a triaxial nucleus when the total spin of the nucleus does not align along any of the principal axes , but precesses and wobbles around one of the axes , in analogy to an asymmetric deformed top  @xcite .",
    "the wobbling bands were first observed in @xmath1lu  @xcite . since then , seven more wobbling nuclei have been reported , including @xmath2lu  @xcite , @xmath3lu  @xcite , @xmath4lu  @xcite , and @xmath4ta  @xcite in @xmath5 , @xmath0pr  @xcite in @xmath6 , and even - even @xmath7ru  @xcite and @xmath8pd  @xcite in the @xmath9 mass regions . among the odd-@xmath10 wobblers ,",
    "@xmath0pr is the only one out of the @xmath5 mass region , which is built on a proton @xmath11 configuration with a moderate deformation ( @xmath12 ) , while the others in @xmath5 involve a proton @xmath13 configuration with significantly large deformation ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the excitation energy of a wobbling motion is characterized by wobbling frequency . in the originally predicted wobbler for a pure triaxial rotor ( simple wobbler )  @xcite , the wobbling frequency increases with spin . however , decreasing wobbling frequencies with spin were observed in the lu and ta isotopes as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . to clarify this contradiction , frauendorf and dnau  @xcite distinguished two types of wobbling motions , _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ wobblers , for a triaxial rotor coupled with a high-@xmath15 quasiparticle . for the longitudinal wobbler ,",
    "the quasiparticle angular momentum and the principal axis with the largest moment of inertia ( moi ) are parallel ; for the transverse one , they are perpendicular .",
    "they demonstrated that the wobbling frequency of a longitudinal wobbler increases with spin , while that of a transverse one decreases with spin  @xcite . therefore , the wobbling bands in the lu and ta isotopes are interpreted as transverse wobbling bands .    theoretically , the triaxial particle rotor model ( prm )  @xcite and the cranking model plus random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite have been widely used to describe the wobbling motion . recently , based on the cranking mean field and treating the nuclear orientation as collective degree of freedom , a collective hamiltonian was constructed and applied for the chiral  @xcite and wobbling modes  @xcite .",
    "usually , the orientation of a nucleus in the rotating mean field is described by the polar angle @xmath16 and azimuth angle @xmath17 in spherical coordinates . in the collective hamiltonian for wobbling modes ,",
    "the azimuth angle @xmath17 is taken as the collective coordinate since the motion along the @xmath17 direction is much easier than in the @xmath16 direction  @xcite .",
    "the quantum fluctuations along @xmath17 are taken into account to go beyond the mean - field approximation . using this model ,",
    "the simple , longitudinal , and transverse wobblers were systematically studied and the variation trends of their wobbling frequencies were confirmed  @xcite .    with the successes of the collective hamiltonian , it is interesting to extend its applications . in @xmath0pr",
    "@xcite , not only the transverse wobbling mode , but also its transition to the longitudinal wobbling were observed .",
    "the experimental observations have already been investigated by tilted axis cranking ( tac ) with the strutinsky micro - macro method and the prm in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the collective hamiltonian will be applied to investigate the wobbling motions in @xmath0pr .",
    "the adopted collective hamiltonian was introduced in detail in refs .  @xcite .",
    "choosing the azimuth angle @xmath17 as the collective coordinate , the collective hamiltonian reads @xmath18 where the collective potential @xmath19 is extracted by minimizing the total routhian @xmath20 of tac calculations with respect to the polar angle @xmath16 for given @xmath17  @xcite . for a high-@xmath15",
    ", the tac hamiltonian reads  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the single particle angular momentum and @xmath23 is the single-@xmath15 shell hamiltonian , @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , the parameter @xmath25 is proportional to the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is triaxial deformation parameter .",
    "diagonalizing the cranking hamiltonian , one ends up with the total routhian @xmath28 and then the collective potential @xmath19 .    to obtain the mass parameter",
    ", one can expand the collective potential @xmath19 with respect to @xmath17 at @xmath29 up to @xmath30 terms to extract the stiffness parameter ( labeled @xmath31 ) of @xmath19  @xcite , and then @xmath32 with @xmath33 the wobbling frequency .",
    "for example , for a simple wobbler , its stiffness parameter is @xmath34  @xcite , and its wobbling frequency can be calculated by the triaxial rotor model :  @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 the rotational frequency .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , the mass parameter is  @xcite @xmath37    for an odd-@xmath10 wobbler , one further introduces the harmonic frozen alignment ( hfa ) approximation  @xcite ; i.e. , the odd particle is assumed to be firmly aligned with axis 1 ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and its angular momentum is considered as a constant number @xmath15 .",
    "such an assumption leads to an @xmath36-dependent effective moi for axis 1 with @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is replaced by  @xcite @xmath39        if the angular momentum of the odd particle tilts from axis 1 toward axis 2 , as illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the effective moi induced should be modified accordingly .",
    "if the tilted angle is @xmath17 , the effective mois for axes 1 and 2 are @xmath40 correspondingly , the mass parameter ( [ eq1 ] ) should be rewritten as @xmath41    with the collective potential from the tac model  @xcite and the mass parameter from the hfa formula  ( [ eq2 ] ) , the collective hamiltonian ( [ eq4 ] ) is constructed .",
    "similar to refs .",
    "@xcite , the collective hamiltonian is solved by diagonalization .",
    "since the collective hamiltonian is invariant with respect to the @xmath42 transformation , one chooses the following bases @xmath43 which satisfy @xmath44 and the periodic boundary condition as @xmath45",
    "in the following calculations , the configuration of the wobbling bands in @xmath0pr is adopted as @xmath46 .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameters follow refs .  @xcite as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . accordingly , the axes 1 , 2 , and 3 are respectively the short , intermediate , and long axes .",
    "the mois for the three principal axes are taken as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51=13.0 , 21.0 , 4.0  @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that all the parameters are the same as in previous works  @xcite , and no adjustable parameters are introduced in the present calculations .",
    "in a recent reported transverse wobbling partners in the @xmath53 mass region , @xmath0pr , the wobbling frequency decreases with spin , and the @xmath54 interband transitions between the partner bands display primarily @xmath55 character  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the tac strutinsky micro - macro calculations adopt the deformation parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the prm ( or so - called quasiparticle triaxial rotor model ) adopts the mois as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51=13.0 , 21.0 , 4.0  @xmath52 , respectively . in the present collective hamiltonian calculations , we also use the same parameters  @xcite , and no additional parameters .    the total routhian surfaces @xmath20 calculated by the tac model for @xmath0pr at the rotational frequencies @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the minima are labeled with red stars .",
    "it can be seen that all the total routhian surfaces are symmetric with respect to the @xmath60 and @xmath61 lines , as a result of the invariance of the intrinsic quadrupole moments with respect to the @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath16 values of the minima always locate at @xmath61 .",
    "this is because axis 3 is of the smallest moi and , as a consequence , the angular momentum prefers to align in the 1 - 2 plane . with the increase of rotational frequency ,",
    "the @xmath17 values of the minima gradually deviate from a vanishing value to finite angles . as a result ,",
    "the number of the minima changes from one to two .",
    "this implies the rotational mode changes from a principal axis rotation at low frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 mev ) to a planar rotation at high frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev ) .",
    "these features provide a hint of the existence of the transverse wobbling mode  @xcite .     for @xmath0pr at the frequencies @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",

    "the two symmetric minima are separated by a potential barrier .",
    "the height of the barrier can be defined as @xmath77 .",

    "it is expected that , if the rotational frequency continuously increases , @xmath78 would become larger and drive the minima to approach @xmath79 , which then changes the rotational mode from a planar rotation to a principal axis rotation around axis 2 .",
