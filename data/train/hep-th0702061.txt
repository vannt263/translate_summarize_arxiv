    "string vacua with magnetic fields turned on in the compact extra dimensions ( `` flux compactifications '' ) have attracted much attention since many years .",
    "the crucial feature is that their contribution to the energy of the system depends on the moduli of the geometry which supports them , so to provide an effective four dimensional potential for the moduli fields , possibly lifting some or all of them .",
    "moreover the fluxes are quantized , so their strength is not another continuously varying free parameter .",
    "together these give a mechanism for moduli stabilization .    from this point of view ,",
    "particularly interesting are type iia vacua , since in many models a complete stabilization of the moduli can be accomplished at tree level in supergravity , that is without appealing to @xmath0 corrections or actually to string loops or non - perturbative effects .",
    "this is because the classical effective moduli potential generated by the tree level iia supergravity action ( supplemented with o6-plane sources ) has stable _ isolated _ minima @xcite .",
    "being concrete @xcite , if we consider type iia theory on a calabi - yau three - fold , switching on r - r fluxes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 stabilizes all the khler moduli of the internal manifold . to stabilize also the complex structure moduli",
    ", one has to introduce a ns - ns 3-form flux @xmath4 .",
    "however this gives a tadpole for the d6-charge , that can be cancelled by the introduction of orientifold six - planes .",
    "they also help in halving the complex structure moduli .",
    "the full system then stabilizes all the moduli , essentially at leading order in @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "an approximation widely used in the literature to study string vacua in the supergravity regime , in which r - r and ns - ns field - strengths are switched on , is the so called `` calabi - yau with fluxes '' approximation .",
    "it resides in taking the flux contribution to the supergravity action and the equations of motion small compared to the curvature contribution , and it works in the large volume limit .",
    "being the fluxes quantized by dirac quantization condition , the minimum amount of a @xmath6-form field - strength is @xmath7 .",
    "then one requires the contribution of fluxes to the action to be small compared to the einstein term @xmath8 , which is of order @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 the characteristic length of the manifold ) .",
    "this gives @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , we must be in the limit of large compactification manifold with respect to the string length , which anyway is the regime of applicability of supergravity . under these conditions",
    ", one can neglect the backreaction of fluxes on the geometry , and work with calabi - yau metric solutions .",
    "of course one has to be careful to remember that in the action the various contributions are weighted by the string coupling , and both the dilaton and the volume are ( possibly ) determined by the fluxes themselves , so it is not always possible to keep the fluxes to their minimal amount while increasing the volume .",
    "such an approximation can also hide subtle phenomena .",
    "for example , even the minimum amount of flux allowed by dirac quantization condition can , if correctly taken into account , change the topology of the manifold as well as cohomology classes and so on .",
    "it is not clear how the calabi - yau geometry can approximate disconnected topologies .",
    "another powerfull tool in the discussion of moduli stabilization is the reduction to a four dimensional effective theory , with the computation of the 4d effective potential for light fields .",
    "then vacua are found by looking at its stationary points .",
    "many issues are studied more easily than with a ten dimensional approach .",
    "for instance , stability is checked just by looking at the second derivatives of the potential .",
    "moreover non - supersymmetric vacua can be analyzed as well , and there is some control on exotic vacua , such as non - geometric vacua @xcite .",
    "the approach has anyway also bad facets .",
    "first of all , one has to work in a kaluza - klein approximation , expanding the ten dimensional fields on a kaluza - klein basis ( suitable for a calabi - yau geometry without fluxes ) and then keeping only light fields . in general",
    "there is no guaranty that the same basis furnishes the light fields in presence of background fluxes . moreover , even finding stable minima of the 4d effective potential , one can not be in general sure about the existence of a 10d lift .",
    "all these reasons brought us to undertake the ten dimensional approach , and the following discussion is based on @xcite .    in @xcite type iia string vacua in the supergravity limit",
    "were constructed , by compactifying on the orbifold @xmath12 and then adding o6-planes .",
    "such vacua were analyzed classically and in the large volume regime , by computing the 4d effective potential and deriving it from a superpotential .",
    "our main result will be to provide a full 10d description of their vacua with backreacting fluxes @xcite , reproducing their results .",
    "a key ingredient is a smearing procedure .",
    "indeed we show that in no case with non - trivial fluxes and localized sources ( o6-planes ) the geometry is calabi - yau , and this makes it hard to exhibit explicit examples .",
    "we overcome the problem by homogeneously distributing the o6-charge on the internal manifold , which makes it possible to find calabi - yau solutions with backreacting non - trivial fluxes . we stress",
    "that all these solutions have _ constant _ dilaton , and the string coupling can be kept arbitrarily small everywhere .",
    "another approach attempted to give a full description of the vacua in @xcite appeared in @xcite .",
    "the authors performed a double t - duality of the system to get rid of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 fluxes , and then uplifted to m - theory .",
    "the starting point to give a full ten dimensional description in the supergravity regime of the vacua constructed in @xcite are the lust - tsimpis solutions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they are the most general solutions of type iia supergravity compactified on a warped product of @xmath13 and an internal @xmath14-structure manifold , which preserve @xmath15 supersymmetry in 4d .",
    "all the fluxes compatible with the poincar symmetry of @xmath13 are switched on .",
    "these include also a `` mass parameter '' @xmath16 , which is one of the r - r fluxes provided by iia string theory and at low energy is described within the so called massive type iia supergravity @xcite",
    ". then we will add o6-planes to them in a way to preserve @xmath15 supersymmetry , in order to be able to realize , among the others , the @xmath12 orientifold model of @xcite .",
    "the internal manifold is taken to be an @xmath14-structure manifold , so to have one globally defined spinor that , combined with the four dimensional ones , lets us construct four 10d killing spinors .",
    "an @xmath14-structure manifold is described by a khler 2-form @xmath17 and an holomorphic 3-form @xmath18 , like on a calabi - yau 3-fold .",
    "but , unlike that case , they are not closed .",
    "rather their differentials , conveniently split according to @xmath14 representations , define the torsion classes and measure the deviation from the calabi - yau geometry @xcite : @xmath19 here @xmath20 are the five torsion classes , and the specific @xmath14 representation is indicated .    in the present setup , supersymmetry only allows the non - vanishing torsion classes @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite , where minus stands for the imaginary part .",
    "this restricts the possible geometries to a special subclass of _ half - flat _ manifolds .",
    "we can introduce orientifold six - planes in the picture .",
    "these are not genuine supergravity objects , rather they are defined by projecting the type iia string theory .",
    "however the supergravity action can be enriched with terms that describe the interaction of o - planes with the low energy fields . in type iia",
    "string theory , an o6-plane is obtained by modding out the theory by the discrete symmetry operator @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the world - sheet parity , @xmath25 is the left - moving spacetime fermion number and @xmath26 is an isometrical involution of the background .",
    "the fixed point locus of @xmath26 is the o6-plane . in type iia",
    "string theory an o6-plane is a bps object that preserves half of the supersymmetries , by relating the two majorana - weyl supersymmetry parameters according to @xmath27 . in the vacua we are going to construct",
    "we want to preserve 4d poincar symmetry , so the o6-planes will span the @xmath13 factor and will wrap a three dimensional cycle in the internal manifold . in order to obtain again vacua with four supercharges , we must place the o6-planes in such a way to preserve the four supercharges of the background .",
    "this is achieved by wrapping the planes on supersymmetric 3-cycles @xmath28 , which in the case of @xmath14-structure manifolds are generalized special lagrangian 3-cycles to be antiholomorphic with respect to the almost complex structure j , and the pull - back of the ns - ns 2-form potential @xmath29 on @xmath28 to vanish . ]",
    "@xcite : @xmath30    the description of the low energy dynamics is achieved , at leading order in @xmath0 , by adding to the type iia supergravity action a dirac - born - infeld and a wess - zumino term for the o6-planes .",
    "the main modification is a violation of the bianchi identity for the r - r 2-form field - strength @xmath2 , since o6-planes couple to the r - r 7-form potential @xmath31 and are thus magnetic sources for @xmath2 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the o6-charge distribution , a 3-form localized on @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath4 is the ns - ns 3-form field - strength and @xmath34 is the einstein frame d6-charge .",
    "by imposing supersymmetry we can find the following solutions , where everything is determined by the geometry : @xmath35 in particular , the geometry is again a special subclass of half - flat .",
    "some explanations are in order .",
    "@xmath3 is the r - r 4-form field - strength , @xmath36 is a freund - rubin parameter , @xmath37 is the iia dilaton and @xmath38 is the warp factor which is found to be constant .",
    "@xmath39 is the irreducible component of @xmath2 transforming in the @xmath40 of @xmath14 , and is constrained by the o6-charge distribution : @xmath41 generalizing the argument in @xcite one can show that these are actually solutions of the equations of motion .    from and , keeping @xmath33 a localized form , we can derive the inequality @xmath42 , from which an important observation follows .",
    "as long as the mass parameter @xmath43 is different from zero , @xmath21 is non - trivial and there are _ no calabi - yau _ solutions ( by careful analysis , @xmath44 leads to trivial calabi - yau solutions without fluxes and o6-planes ) .",
    "constructing explicit examples of half flat manifolds which solve the equations , even without o6-planes , is difficult ( for some attempts see @xcite ) .",
    "one possible way out is to apply a smearing procedure , much like the smearing of d - branes : the o6-charge is homogeneously distributed over the internal manifold , while the orientifold projection is kept untouched . by substituting the localized charge distribution @xmath33 with the smeared one : @xmath45 it is possible to find solutions with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "these are calabi - yau geometries with non - trivial backreacting fluxes .",
    "more generally , every calabi - yau 3-fold that admits an anti - holomorphic involution provides a solution of our equations , with o6-planes along the fixed point locus of the involution . moreover , as we will see in the next section , in such geometries all moduli can be stabilized .    by integrating on a cycle @xmath49 symplectic partner of @xmath28 , it is possible to show that the dilaton is fixed to @xmath50 and the 4d cosmological constant is fixed as well .",
    "summarizing , the solution is completely described by an internal calabi - yau manifold defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with an antiholomorphic isometrical involution @xmath26 .",
    "further constraints come from the integral quantization of fluxes , and this mechanism provides the stabilization of _ all _ moduli .",
    "the next step is to use the class of solutions previously found to discuss the possible presence of free moduli .",
    "the question is  is there a continuously connected family of vacua , or do they form only a discrete set",
    "? we will answer by exploiting the class of smeared calabi - yau solutions , but the same discussion could be carried over in the localized case .",
    "first of all we split the vev of a field strength in two pieces , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath51 .",
    "the first piece , closed and non - trivial in cohomology , represents the integral flux contribution , while the second one , exact , encodes any other oscillation or deformation .",
    "in such a separation there is of course some arbitrariness . from our smeared calabi - yau solution , we know @xmath4 to be harmonic , so the natural choice is to take @xmath52 harmonic as a representative of the cohomology class , and then use the gauge freedom to put also @xmath29 harmonic .",
    "the fact that this is always possible shows that can not be any physical non - harmonic component in @xmath29 : these have vanishing vev and are massive",
    ". then we can expand @xmath52 and @xmath29 in an harmonic basis and substitute in the solution , to see if free parameters are left .",
    "we can easily handle the @xmath12 orientifold model of @xcite .",
    "the geometry is the orbifold limit of a calabi - yau manifold with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , where 9 of the 12 khler moduli arise from the blow - up modes of 9 @xmath55 singularities .",
    "we will not discuss the twisted moduli here , since they fit well in the general calabi - yau case @xcite .",
    "it s useful to introduce an integral basis of harmonic forms : the 2-forms ( odd under @xmath26 ) @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; the 4-forms ( even under @xmath26 ) @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the two values among @xmath61 besides @xmath62 .",
    "the field - strengths are split according to : @xmath63 notice that being @xmath64 harmonic , it is actually vanishing on a calabi - yau manifold",
    ". then we expand on the harmonic basis both the fluxes , integrally quantized , and the forms possibly containing free moduli : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath6 and @xmath68 ( as well as @xmath43 ) are quantized in suitable units , and @xmath69 .",
    "the could - be moduli are @xmath70 , @xmath37 and the axions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which pair into 4d chiral fields .",
    "the only non - trivial tadpole cancellation condition is @xmath73 .",
    "substituting in the smeared solution we get @xmath74 . taking for simplicity @xmath75",
    "we also get : @xmath76 we could also compute the 4d cosmological constant @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "everything is in perfect agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the same machinery applies to general calabi - yau solutions with general backreacting fluxes and smeared o6-planes , as discussed in @xcite . in general there are enough equations to fix almost all the would - be moduli : all the khler and complex structure moduli , the dilaton , all axions from @xmath29 and one axion from @xmath78 .",
    "the remaining @xmath78 axions turn out not to be fixed yet , but this is not a phenomenological problem .",
    "taking values on a compact @xmath79 , there can not be any dangerous runaway behavior and any other contribution to their effective potential lifts them .",
