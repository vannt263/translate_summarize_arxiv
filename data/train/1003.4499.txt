    "the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice is the simplest realistic toy model for description of the electronic correlation effects in general many - electron problems with short - range interaction on such a lattice .",
    "the model involves two effective parameters : the in - plane nearest - neighbor transfer integral @xmath0 and the effective on - site repulsion @xmath1 . despite",
    "that it is among the mostly studied models in condensed matter and ultra - cold atom physics , except for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bipartite lattice @xcite there is no exact solution and few controlled approximations exist for finite @xmath10 values .",
    "one of the few exact results for the model on a general bipartite lattice is that the ground state of the repulsive half - filled hubbard model is for finite number of lattice sites and spin density @xmath12 a spin singlet @xcite .",
    "a method to achieve further useful information about the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice such as the square lattice @xcite , honeycomb lattice @xcite , or cubic lattice @xcite involves the use of suitable systems of ultra - cold fermionic atoms .",
    "indeed , one may expect very detailed experimental results over a wide range of parameters to be available @xcite .",
    "preliminary results referring to the mott - hubbard insulating phase of the the hubbard model on a cubic lattice are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is another exact result concerning the hubbard model on any bipartite lattice .",
    "it is that in addition to the spin @xmath11 symmetry the model has a second global @xmath11 symmetry @xcite , called by some authors and in this paper @xmath13-spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "a trivial result is that at @xmath14 the global symmetry of the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice at vanishing chemical potential and magnetic field is @xmath15 . here",
    "the factor @xmath16 refers to the particle - hole transformation on a single spin under which the model hamiltonian is not invariant for @xmath4 and @xmath7/z_2 $ ] contains the two @xmath11 symmetries .",
    "following work by heilmann and lieb @xcite , yang and zhang considered the most natural possibility that the @xmath17 symmetry inherited from the @xmath14 hamiltonian @xmath15 symmetry was the model global symmetry for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study of the problem by the author and collaborators reported in ref .",
    "@xcite reveals an exact extra hidden global @xmath5 symmetry emerging for @xmath4 in addition to @xmath17 .",
    "it is related to the @xmath4 local @xmath19 gauge symmetry of the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice with vanishing transfer integral @xcite .",
    "such a local @xmath19 gauge symmetry becomes for finite @xmath1 and @xmath0 a group of permissible unitary transformations .",
    "it is such that the corresponding local @xmath5 canonical transformation is not the ordinary @xmath5 gauge subgroup of electromagnetism .",

    "the square and 1d lattices have spacing @xmath40 and length edge and chain length @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "an important point is that although addition of chemical - potential and magnetic - field operator terms to the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice hamiltonian lowers its symmetry , such terms commute with it .",
    "therefore , the global symmetry being @xmath3 implies that the set of independent rotated - electron occupancy configurations that generate the model energy and momentum eigenstates generate state representations of that global symmetry for all values of the electronic density @xmath42 and spin density @xmath43 .",
    "it then follows that the total number of such independent representations must equal the hilbert - space dimension , @xmath44 .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite confirm that for the model on a bipartite lattice in its full hilbert space the number of independent representations of the group @xmath3 is indeed @xmath44 .",

    "studies of the hubbard model on a bitartie lattice that rely on its transformation properties under symmetry operations @xcite should be extended to account for the new hidden @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the hubbard model on the bipartite 1d lattice has an exact solution @xcite , which can be shown to be fully consistent with its extended global symmetry .",
    "the exact solution of 1d integrable models can be reached by two different methods : the coordinate bethe ansatz ( ba ) used by bethe himself @xcite and the more algebraic operator formulation usually called inverse scattering method @xcite . for the 1d hubbard model such an algebraic formulation of the bethe states refers to the transfer matrix of the classical coupled spin model , which is its  covering \" @xcite .",
    "indeed , within the inverse scattering method @xcite the central object to be diagonalized is the quantum transfer matrix rather than the underlying 1d hubbard model .",
    "the transfer - matrix eigenvalues provide the spectrum of a set of conserved charges .",
    "the diagonalization of the charge degrees of freedom involves a transfer matrix associated with a charge monodromy matrix @xcite .",
    "its off - diagonal entries are some of the creation and annihilation fields whose application onto a suitable vacuum generates the charge degrees of freedom of the energy eigenstates configurations .",
    "the solution of the spin degrees of freedom involves the diagonalization of the auxiliary transfer matrix associated with the spin monodromy matrix @xcite .",
    "again , the off - diagonal entries of that matrix play the role of the creation and annihilation fields that generate the spin degrees of freedom of the energy eigenstates configurations .",
    "the global symmetry of a solvable model is explicit in the algebraic operator formulation of its solution .",
    "this is why the solution of the 1d hubbard model by the algebraic inverse scattering method @xcite was achieved only thirty years after that of the coordinate ba @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was expected that the charge and spin monodromy matrices of the former method had the same traditional faddeev - zamolodchikov abcd form , found previously for the related 1d isotropic heinsenberg model @xcite .",
    "such an expectation was that consistent with the occurrence of a spin @xmath11 symmetry and a @xmath13-spin charge @xmath11 symmetry associated with a global @xmath7/z_2 $ ] symmetry @xcite . if that was the whole global symmetry of the 1d hubbard model , the charge and spin monodromy matrices would have the same abcd form .",
    "consistently with the recently found model extended global symmetry , all tentative schemes using charge and spin monodromy matrices of the same abcd form failed to achieve the ba equations obtained by means of the coordinate ba @xcite . as discussed in appendix a , the problem was solved by martins and ramos , who used an appropriate representation of the charge and spin monodromy matrices , which allows for possible _ hidden symmetries",
    "indeed , the structure of the charge and spin monodromy matrices introduced by these authors is able to distinguish creation and annihilation fields as well as possible hidden symmetries .",
    "that for @xmath18 the 1d hubbard model spin and charge degrees of freedom are associated with the @xmath11 and @xmath45 symmetries , respectively , of @xmath46/z_2 ^ 2=so(3)\\times so(3)\\times u(1)$ ] rather than merely with two @xmath11 symmetries , is behind the different abcd and abcdf forms found in ref .",

    "is expected to have important physical consequences .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is the introduction of a general quantum - object description for the hubbard model on the bipartite square lattice to be used in ref . @xcite and elsewhere in the search of such physical consequences . to meet that goal , the description introduced in this paper accounts for a set of independent rotated - electron occupancy configurations that generate the model state representations of the global @xmath3 symmetry for all values of the electronic density @xmath42 and spin density @xmath43 . for the 1d hubbard model",
    "such a complete set of states associated with the operator description introduced here are energy eigenstates and refer to the exact solution quantum numbers and set of conserving quantities . due to the square - lattice hubbard model lack of integrability and corresponding lack of an infinite number of conservation laws , for it only in the one- and two - electron subspace introduced in section v",
    "are the above states energy eigenstates .",
    "fortunately , such model in that subspace describes the important one- and two - electron physics . furthermore",
    ", one of the motivations for our study focusing onto the hubbard model on the square lattice follows from that model with a small three - dimensional ( 3d ) uniaxial anisotropy perturbation being the simplest candidate toy model for describing the effects of electronics correlations in the high-@xmath47 superconductors @xcite .",
    "the first step of our program involves an electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation of the type considered in ref .",
    "a property specific to our transformation is that the @xmath18 energy eigenstates can be generated from suitable chosen @xmath48 energy eigenstates upon application onto the latter states of the corresponding electron - rotated - electron unitary operator .",
    "the related set of state representations of the group @xmath3 that emerge from our description are energy eigenstates yet are generated by exactly the same electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation from corresponding @xmath48 states .",

    "the remaining degrees of freedom of such rotated - electron occupancy configurations are described by the @xmath54 $ ] @xmath52 fermion holes .",
    "the expression of the rotated - electron operators in terms of these three elementary objects is for @xmath18 identical to that of the electron operators for large @xmath1 values in terms of the three objects obtained from the exact transformation for separation of spin-@xmath9 fermions without constraints considered in ref .",

    "often we discuss the use of our description for the model on a 1d lattice as well .",

    "<S> in this paper a general description for the hubbard model with nearest - neighbor transfer integral @xmath0 and on - site repulsion @xmath1 on a square lattice with @xmath2 sites is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it refers to three types of elementary objects whose occupancy configurations generate the state representations of the model extended global @xmath3 symmetry recently found in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such objects emerge from a suitable electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> it is such that rotated - electron single and double occupancy are good quantum numbers for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the description is that it accounts for the new found hidden @xmath5 symmetry in @xmath6/z_2 ^ 2 $ ] beyond the well - known @xmath7/z_2 $ ] model ( partial ) global symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the hidden @xmath5 symmetry state representations store full information on the positions of the spins of the rotated - electron singly occupied sites relative to the remaining sites . profiting from that complementary information , for the whole @xmath8 interaction range independent spin state representations </S>",
    "<S> are naturally generated in terms of spin-@xmath9 spinon occupancy configurations in a spin effective lattice . </S>",
    "<S> for all states such an effective lattice has as many sites as spinons . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the extension to intermediate @xmath10 values of the usual large-@xmath10 descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons that singly occupy sites , now in terms of the spins of the singly - occupied sites rotated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the operator description introduced in this paper brings about a more suitable scenario for handling the effects of hole doping . within it </S>",
    "<S> such effects are accounted for in terms of the residual interactions of the elementary objects whose occupancy configurations generate the state representations of the charge hidden @xmath5 symmetry and spin @xmath11 symmetry , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is investigated elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting physical information revealed by the description refers to the model on the subspace generated by application of one- and two - electron operators onto zero - magnetization ground states . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is the square - lattice quantum liquid further studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , to access such an information one must start from the general description introduced in this paper , which refers to the model in the full hilbert space . </S>"
