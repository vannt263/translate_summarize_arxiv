    "the inset depicts the measurement scheme : the contact  b was always grounded , positive ( filled symbols ) and negative ( empty symbols ) voltage was applied to the contact  a.,height=260 ]    as one can see , the salient feature of all the measured @xmath37 characteristics is an asymmetry becoming well - procounced above 0.1  v. moreover , the character of the characteristics strongly distingtive to the reduction of the neck width : for the sample with neck width of 12  @xmath9 m two parts in the curve can be distinguished  the initial rising part ( below 0.3  v ) which bends with voltage and above 0.7  v transits to the second , saturated one . with the decrease of the width @xmath35",
    "the saturated part transforms to a boosting region with highly expressed asymmetry .",
    "a complex behaviour is observed in the 5  @xmath9 m width sample : careful look can resolve initial rising part below 0.15  v , rudiments of saturated part within 0.150.6  v and already emerging boosting region above 0.6  v with spread influence on all the curve .",
    "it should be pointed out that the asymmetry is strongly sensitive to the temperature variation .",
    "this is illustrated by the experimental data for 2  @xmath9 m neck sample given in fig .",
    "it is seen that at low temperatures the asymmetry is rather large ",
    "if the coefficient of asymmetry of the @xmath37 characteristics is defined as @xmath38  at liquid helium temperature under 0.8  v it is 0.506 , at 80  k its value is about 0.369 , meanwhile at room temperature the asymmetry is nearly invisible . to resolve the effect ,",

    "to understand the physics behind the observed phenomenon , we have followed the same ideology as in the bulk case of asymmetrically - shaped structures : we explore an asymmetrically shaped two - dimensional structure by a solving a coupled system of one - dimensional poisson and current - flow equations neglecting quantum effects@xcite :    @xmath39=- \\frac{|e|}{\\epsilon}\\left(n(x)-n_{d}\\right)},\\\\   i=\\{|e|n(x)\\mu(e)e(x)+|e|d(e(x))\\frac{d}{dx}[n(x)]\\}s(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 denotes the position along the symmetry axis of the asymmetrically - shaped sample , @xmath41 is the cross - section area of the sample , @xmath42 is the electron concentration , @xmath43 is the donor concentration ( used here as a free fit parameter ) , @xmath44 denotes the electric field strength , @xmath45 is the dielectric constant of the sample , @xmath46 denotes the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath47 is the electron mobility .",
    "the diffusion coefficient may be set to a constant value as its dependence on the electric field has no appreciable influence on the results .",
    "as it is known , mobility @xmath47 changes with the electric field:@xcite @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the cut - off velocity equal to @xmath51 cm / s .    for a given value of the current @xmath52 , one can employ an iterative scheme to solve self - consistently the system and calculate the voltage .",
    "results of the electric field and relative carrier density calculations are given in fig .",
    "the model calculations do give two different gradients of the electric field induced by the asymmetrical shape of the structure depicted in fig .",
    "one must note further that the distribution depends on the current direction , and this difference is appreciable only within several microns from the neck : the electric field peaks are sharper in the case of the reverse current , when the a - contact of the sample is under a positive bias .",
    "m neck width under @xmath52 = 0.03  ma at liquid helium temperature .",
    ", height=257 ]    hence , the in - plane geometrical asymmetry induces two different gradients of the electric field in the sample . as a consequence , different spatial accumulation of two - dimensional electrons in the vicinity of the neck",
    "can be a reason for asymmetric @xmath37 curves .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by the theoretically calculated @xmath37 characteristics and their comparison with the experimental data presented in fig .",
    "5 . as one can see , the measured and calculated @xmath37 curves in 12  @xmath9 m neck width samples behave similarly : in low electric fields , where ohm s law is still valid , the current values are the same and do not depend on the polarity of the applied voltage .",
    "however , with the increase of voltage  when sample is tuned to a strong field regime  the electrons become hot , they accumulate differently in the vicinity of the neck due the asymmetrical shape of the structure . as a result , the asymmetry in the @xmath37 characteristics is observed .",
    "since this phenomenon relies on hot - carriers , it is reasonable that is temperature - sensitive : the decrease of lattice temperature will make the effect much more pronounced since the carrier heating at low temperatures is stronger .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .  3 : the difference between the forward and the reverse - bias curves , for instance , at room temperature@xcite is approximately by three orders of magnitude smaller than that at 4.2  k temperature in the given voltage range .",
    "the temperature effect is also confirmed by theoretical calculations ( data are not given here ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of two different electric field gradients in the hot two dimensional electron regime , allows one to explain the asymmetry of @xmath37 characteristics at low temperatures .",
    "the phenomenon can be called thus the two - dimensional bigradient effect .",
    "it is reasonable that the reduction of the neck should cause stronger asymmetry in @xmath37 curves .",
    "experimentally it is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . however ,",
    "if one compares the behavior of the curves , for instance , for the 5  @xmath9 m neck sample with a corresponding theoretical estimates ( fig .  5 ) , evident differences can be indentified :     ( bottom plot ) characteristics in the asymmetrically - shaped samples with different  12  @xmath9 m and 5  @xmath9 m  neck widths at liquid helium temperature.,height=343 ]    the theory does not follow the experiment anymore neither in curve shape nor in asymmetry value . therefore , in order to understand the origin of the behavior , a more complete theoretical model must be applied .",
    "althought the equation ( 1 ) is the backbone of electronic device simulations , in the current situation one needs to be extended taking into account the electric field gradient - induced term.@xcite the electron average velocity can be then expressed using the extended / augmented drift - diffusion model@xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the drift velocity in a homogeneous electric field , @xmath19 denotes diffusion coefficient , @xmath55 depics the length coefficient .",
    "the latter parameter is in the order of electron mean free path and determines the severity of the velocity overshoot effect which is pronounced when the variation range of the electric field is equal to or shorter than @xmath55 .",
    "also , it is worth noting that in the given equation we have assumed that nonlocality in diffusion coefficient is negligible and has no observable influence on the effect .",
    "a point of departure for analyzis is an estimate of a mean free path ( @xmath56 ) of two dimensional electrons at liquid helium temperatures . as electron mobility in the studied structures",
    "is of about 1@xmath32/(v@xmath5s ) , this results to the value of    @xmath57    where @xmath58=0.068@xmath59 , the latter is the free electron mass .",
    "meanings of other symbols are the same as in previous formulae .",
    "the second step in considering the data is an estimate of the distribution of the electric field in the vicinity of the neck .",
    "voltage value of 0.25  v was chosen as a reference point , since experimentally observed asymmetry of the @xmath37 characteristic starts to be strongly expressed .",
    "theoretical calculations using the set of equations ( 2  3 ) are given in fig .",
    "as one can see , the shape of the        electric field distribution strongly varies with the reduction of the neck width : it becomes sharper and the asymmetry becomes more pronounced .",
    "futhermore , distribution of the electric field is squeezed to the narrower range . if for 12  @xmath9 m width sample the electric field extends over 1.7  @xmath9 m , in the 5  @xmath9 m and 2  @xmath9 m necks it is of about 1.2  @xmath9 m and 0.9  @xmath9 m , respectively .",
    "one can assume therefore that in 5  @xmath9 m neck samples the nonlocality can start to predominate since the change of the electric field along the structure is comparable with the electron balistic length .",
    "calculations illustrating the effect of nonlocality in electron drift velocity on @xmath37 characteristics are given    -characteristics of 5  @xmath9 m neck sample using different length coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "note the increase of the asymmetry with @xmath55 in the dependences .",
    "bottom plot : experimental results in 5  @xmath9 m neck sample given for comparison.,width=241,height=317 ]    in fig .  7 .",
    "one can see that increase of @xmath55 has obvious effect in 5  @xmath9 m neck sample  even small increase in length coefficient ( in the range of 0.10.2  @xmath9 m ) stimulates the raise in the asymmetry .",
    "it is evident that calculations for the 5  @xmath9 m are very similar to the given experimental results .",
    "it is deserve to remark that in 12  @xmath9 m neck samples such the influence is not observed ( these theoretical data are omitted here ) .",
    "the inherent feature of the nonlocal effects is a manifestation of the velocity overshoot . to evidence the latter we have performed the monte carlo calculations of the drift velocity in a `` frozen '' electric field taken from a solution of the coupled set of poisson and current - flow equations ( eq .  2 - 3 ) as described previously .",
    "we have simulated the drift of monte carlo particles along the x - direction in the given electric field distribution assuming that the particles enter the modelling region having the boltzmann distribution at the lattice temperature .",
    "the standard three - valley gaas model is applied in the simulation@xcite with an impurity scattering rate corresponding to a @xmath60 donor concentration .",

    "the monte carlo simulation for electric field profiles from fig .",
    "8 gives the coefficient of current asymmetry of 0.48 .",
    "the factor strongly depends on impurity scattering rate : it decreases as the scatering rate increases .",
    "the simulation with donor concentrations 2@xmath62 , 1@xmath63 , and 5@xmath64 gives the coefficient values of 0.62 , 0.48 , and 0.25 , respectively .    to get close - up",
    "view in the physics behind , we have depicted the velocity and @xmath61 profiles in both , forward and reverse , directions ( fig .",
    "also , stationary velocity is added to illustrate the overshoot / undershoot areas .",
    "it is obvious that the electron velocity minima coincide with the @xmath61 maxima forming thus `` comb '' in electron distribution .",
    "the effect is equivalent to the the free - carrier grating formation phenomenon caused by locality of optical phonon emission as already demonstrated in @xmath65 inn structures.@xcite",
    "since the two - dimensional bigradient effect induces asymmetry in @xmath37-characteristics , it is reasonable to consider its possible applications in detection of the high - frequency electromagnetic radiation . to test this idea ,",
    "we have placed samples in a microwave field of 10  ghz frequency and recorded microwave - induced voltage arising over the ends of the sample .",

    "insets show measurement schemes and design differences .",
    "note much higher sensitivity of the 2deg bow - ties diodes.,width=291,height=222 ]    one can see that with the increase of incident power the signal increases linearly in all the range of studied power .",
    "thus , due to the asymmetry in @xmath37 curves caused by the two - dimensional bigradient effect the microwave radiation can be detected @xcite . however , as estimates show , the sensitivity at room temperature is rather low .",
    "for instance , it is only about 12  mv / w and 40  mv / w for the samples with neck width of 12  @xmath9 m and 2  @xmath9 m , respectively .",
    "since the effect is related to the electron heating , the decease in temperature should induce the increase in the detected signal .",
    "the temperature effect , however , is not as large as might be expected from hot - electron physics where change of the signal is proportional to the carrier mobility . as one can see , at 77  k , the detected voltage increases reaching the values of 40  mv / w ( 12  @xmath9 m neck sample ) and 150  mv / w ( 2  @xmath9 m neck sample ) . in fact , the rise in only by a factor of about 4 , while the mobility increases about 14 times .",
    "we associate the outcome with a presence of ballistic electrons which cross the effective length of the samples without scattering.@xcite it is evident that for implementation of the effect into practical devices , such a sensitivity values are not sufficient . following the ideology of the bigradient effect",
    ", one needs to produce much higher non - uniformity of the electric field in the sample s neck vicinity .",
    "this can be achieved easily by metallizing one of the asymmetric parts of the structure .",
    "this is evidenced by calculations of the distribution of the electric field given in fig .",
    "11 .     characteristics .",

    "it is therefore reasonable to expect significantly higher values of the sensitivity .",
    "the experimental illustration is given in fig .",
    "10(b ) where the bigradient structures are compared with the so - called 2deg bow - ties diodes@xcite structures where one of the parts of the sample is covered by metal .",
    "one can see that these devices are nearly in two orders of magnitude more sensitive compared to the structures of bigradient - design",
    ".    of particular interest for the direct applications are the values of the voltage sensitivity at room temperature . in order to increase the sensitivity of the diode , we have chosen the design 2deg - b ( due to the higher value of the sensitivity at room temperature ) and reduced the size of the apex down to 2  @xmath9 m keeping the other geometrical dimensions the same ( fig .",
    "12 ) . as one can see",
    ", in this case the detected signals are significantly larger than for the 12  @xmath9 m neck diodes at 300  k , and the sensitivity amounts to 2.5  v / w , which is nearly one order of magnitude higher compared to the diodes of 12  @xmath9 m neck width , where it is about 0.32  v / w .",
    "the decrease in temperature down to 77  k allows one to increase the sensitivity up to nearly 40  v / w , i.e. close to a factor of 14.5 which corresponds to the change of 2deg mobility . the latter effect  via thickness of spacer  is also nicely expressed in fig .",
    "12 were the detected signal in both devices , fabricated from 2deg - a- and 2deg - b - type structures is compared .",
    "additionally , it deserves mentioning that the further decrease of the neck size down to 1  @xmath9 m  800  nm , gives , however , no increase in the sensitivity ( the data are not presented here ) .",
    "we attribute it to weaker coupling of the microwave field into the structure with the reduction of the neck width .",

    "linear function is also given as a guide for an eye.,height=264 ]    as to dynamical range , the devices can be used to detect rather different power levels . as already indicated above , the bigradient modulation - doped structures at 300  k in microwaves exhibit sensitivity of about 12  mv / w and 40  mv / w for the samples with neck width of 12  @xmath9 m and 2  @xmath9 m , respectively , however , the sensing range is below 1  w in a pulse mode , i.e. the resistance to overloading is small .",

    "it is seen that in the bulk semiconductor the nonlocality is associated with the sign change in the asymmetry clearly observed within 1 - 10  v voltage scale at 77  k ( see inset ) .",

    "asymmetrically in - plane shaped gaas / algaas modulation - doped structures of various design are studied within 4300  k temperature range .",
    "we have shown that current  voltage characteristics of such structures at low , 480  k , temperatures exhibits pronounced asymmetry which we explain by a two - dimensional bigradient effect .",
    "this phenomenon can be decomposed into two constituents  carrier accumulation and nonlocality in the electron drift velocity  each of which manifests itself depending on the values of the in - plane electric fields and their gradients .",
    "varying these parameters via change of the sample neck we have inferred that the effect is induced by different accumulation of two - dimensional electrons due to asymmetrical shape of the structure when the neck size down is 12  @xmath9 m ; in 5  @xmath9 m neck size structures in electric fields close to 3  kv / cm , the nonlocality of the electron drift velocity becomes predominating causing thus further increase of the asymmetry in @xmath37 curves .",
    "the theoretical models suggested conform well with the obtained experimental results .",
    "monte carlo simulation has shown strong nonlocal effects in the electron drift velocity and presence of overshoot / undershoot regions depending on the electric field and its gradient values .",
    "the features of the two - dimensional bigradient effect and its bulk equivalent are compared and possible applications of this phenomenon to detect electromagnetic radiation of ghz and thz frequencies are discussed as well .",
