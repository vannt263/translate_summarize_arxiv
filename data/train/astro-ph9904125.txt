    "it is remarkable that the simple fireball model for cosmological gamma - ray bursts can explain the many major features of the gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows ( rees & mzsros 1992 , 1994 ; paczynski & rhodes 1993 ; wijers , rees , & mzsros 1997 ; vietri 1997a , b ; waxman 1997a , b ; reichart 1997 ; katz & piran 1997 ; sari 1997 ) .",
    "it is noted , however , that the fireball model may produce multiple spectral components due to the existence of both the forward and reverse shocks at least at some time period ( e.g. , mzsros , rees , & papathanassiou 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , reprocessing of the primary spectrum by , for example , inverse compton scattering ( e.g. , pilla & loeb 1998 ) , introduces additional features to the spectra , even if it is initially featureless .",
    "finally , resonant line features or recombination lines due to heavy elements , for example , in dense blobs as discussed in mzsros & rees ( 1998 ) , may add additional features to the continuum . in this _ letter _",
    "it is pointed out that spectral smoothing due to differentially varying doppler shift for different patches of the fireball at varying angles to the line of sight provides an intrinsic , unavoidable smoothing mechanism .",
    "while this effect is fairly well known , a more quantitative analysis focusing on the case of grbs is useful .",
    "this _ letter _ presents such a semi - quantitative analysis .",
    "for the present illustration i assume that the grb fireball is spherical and homogeneous , for which a single parameter , @xmath6 , the angle to the burster - observer vector , is sufficient to characterize the direction of a traveling patch of shock heated , radiation emitting material .",
    "it is convenient to use the time measured in the rest - frame of the burster , @xmath7 , as the independent variable to express other quantities .",
    "first , one has to find the relation between time @xmath7 for a fireball patch at @xmath6 and the time measured by the observer on the earth ( called  _ o _ \" hereafter ) , @xmath8 , i.e. , the arrival time .",
    "since the _ apparent _ perpendicular traveling speed of a patch with @xmath6 seen by _ o _ is @xmath9 in units of the speed of light , where @xmath10 is the spherical expansion speed of the fireball in the rest - frame of the burster . by definition , @xmath11 is @xmath12 combining equations ( 1 , 2 ) gives @xmath13 since one also has the following relation @xmath14 one finds the equation relating @xmath8 to @xmath7 : @xmath15    next , to have a tractable treatment , it is assumed that the lorentz factor , @xmath16 , has the following simplified evolution : it is constant ( equal to @xmath17 ) at @xmath18 and decays at @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath17 is the initial lorentz factor and @xmath21 ( measured in the rest - frame of the burster ) characterizes the transition time after which deceleration of the fireball expansion becomes significant ( hence the fireball kinetic energy can be converted into radiation ) and can be expressed approximately as @xmath22 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , where @xmath23 is the initial fireball energy , @xmath24 is the density of the circumburster medium ( which is assumed to be uniform , for simplicity ) and other notations are conventional .",
    "note that @xmath25 , if the fireball cools radiatively efficiently , and @xmath26 , if the fireball cools only adiabatically .    to make the point in a simple way it is assumed that the total luminosity per unit frequency ( in the comoving frame ) of the shock front at a fixed time @xmath7 is a delta function in frequency ( i.e. , a monochromatic spectrum ) : @xmath27\\ ] ] in the frame comoving with the blastwave .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath28 at time @xmath7 in the comoving frame is parameterized as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "note that , in the case of synchrotron radiation and assuming that both the electron thermal energy density and the magnetic energy density are fixed fractions of the post - shock nucleon thermal energy density , one has @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is another constant and the @xmath35 parameterizes the temporal profile of the amplitude of the radiation .    at a given time _",
    "_ receives radiation from _ different parts across the fireball surface _ , emitted at varying times in the burster frame ; i.e. , radiation from regions of varying @xmath6 at varying @xmath7 [ see equation ( 5 ) for the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ] is seen by _ o _ at the same time ( sari 1998 ) .",
    "the received frequency of the radiation at @xmath8 from region with @xmath6 emitted at @xmath7 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the doppler factor for regions with @xmath6 at time @xmath7 : @xmath39}.\\ ] ] the flux density observed by _",
    "o _ at frequency @xmath0 at time @xmath8 is @xmath40 where @xmath41(@xmath42 ) is the frequency in the blastwave frame , @xmath43 is the distance of the grb from @xmath44 and @xmath45 . combining equations ( 10,11 ) gives @xmath46 inserting equations ( 7,13 ) into equation ( 12 ) and integrating over @xmath0 give @xmath47 note that @xmath48 is in a parametric form ; given @xmath8 , one can determine the burster frame time @xmath7 for a given patch at @xmath6 using equation ( 5 ) .",
    "then , one determines @xmath48 using equation ( 14 ) combined with equations ( 6,8,9,11 ) , given @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "meantime , @xmath49 is related to @xmath7 and @xmath6 by equation ( 10 ) .",
    "thus , one can find @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 at @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider a few simple but relevant cases to illustrate the effect .",
    "case 1 : @xmath26 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this case may have some bearing on such radiation features as atomic line features whose intrinsic frequencies are independent of @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) .",
    "case 2 : @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath52 .",
    "this case may be related to the epoch where radiative cooling is efficient and intensity at the frequency in question is still rising , which could be relevant for radiation at frequencies lower than the peak of the synchrotron radiation spectrum ( due to a truncated power - law electron distribution ) at early times of a grb event .",
    "case 3 : @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath53 .",
    "this may be related to the epoch where radiative cooling is efficient and intensity at the frequency in question has started to decrease , which could be relevant for radiation at frequencies higher than the peak frequency of the spectrum at early times of a grb event .",
    "case 4 : @xmath26 , @xmath31 and @xmath52 , this case is similar to case ( 2 ) with the primary difference that radiative cooling is unimportant here",
    ". this may be relevant for grb afterglows such as the radio afterglows when electron cooling time is likely to be significantly longer than the dynamic time of the expanding fireball at frequencies lower than the peak frequency of the spectrum .",
    "case 5 : @xmath26 , @xmath31 and @xmath53 , this case is similar to case 4 but for frequencies higher than the peak frequency of the spectrum .",
    "while it is convenient to express various quantities using @xmath7 as the independent time variable , one needs to express the final observables using @xmath8 , which is related to @xmath7 ( for @xmath54 ; see equation 5 ) as @xmath55\\ ] ] for the simplified solution of @xmath56 given by equation ( 6 ) . figure ( 1a )",
    "shows the flux density as a function of frequency at @xmath57 for the five cases .",
    "the frequency is normalized such that unity corresponds to the radiation from regions with @xmath54 and the flux density is normalized to be unity at unity frequency .",
    "the sharp turns to the left for cases ( ii , iii , iv , v ) correspond to the sharp turn of the evolution of the lorentz factor at @xmath58 .",
    "figure ( 1b ) shows the flux density as a function of frequency at @xmath59 for the five cases .",
    "also shown in both panels are two straight lines in the upper right corner indicating the spectral slope of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , which bracket the range of the spectral slope for various cases shown .",
    "note that sharp turns as seen in ( 1a ) are not visible simply because they appear at much lower intensity level than the displayed range in the figure .",
    "note that @xmath62",
    ". therefore , for typical values of @xmath23 , @xmath17 and @xmath24 , @xmath8 is of order a second and a day , respectively , after the fireball explosion for the two cases shown in ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) .",
    "these two cases may respectively be relevant for bursts in gamma - ray and afterglows at lower energy bands .",
    "it should be noted that , although the external shock model is used to illustrate the smoothing magnitude , the results should be applicable to the internal shock model as well .",
    "recall that in all cases a delta function spectrum at @xmath0 is assumed in the comoving frame at a given time .",
    "one sees that this delta function spectrum is smoothed out to appear as a broad spectrum with a half - width - half - maximum ( hwhm ) of @xmath1 for all the cases considered , except for case 1 where hwhm is @xmath63 .",
    "an immediate implication from figure 1 ( see the dot - long - dashed curves on the upper right corner in the two panels ) is that the observed spectra of grbs or their afterglows should roughly have @xmath64 , if the electron distribution function power index @xmath65 is equal to greater than @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , _ the observed spectra can not be steeper than @xmath64 regardless the value of @xmath65_. this slope \u001a",
    "it is of interest to understand where the different radiation that correspond to different frequencies in figure 1 comes from .",
    "figure 2 shows the frequency seen by _ o _ at a given time as a function of the emission shell radius from the burster , @xmath67 , expressed in units of @xmath68 .",
    "it is seen that , for realistic cases ( ii , iii , iv , v ) that correspond to the continuum radiation of the grbs and afterglows , higher frequency radiation comes from earlier time @xmath7 ( in the burster frame ) with larger angle @xmath6 up to @xmath21 after which there is a downturn to lower frequency at still earlier times due to assumed constancy of @xmath69 thus constancy of @xmath28 .",
    "for case ( i ) lower frequency radiation comes from earlier time @xmath7 with larger @xmath6 . in both panels ( a , b )",
    "also shown along the solid curves using solid dots are the corresponding @xmath6 values in degrees .",
    "dotted and dashed curves are also punctuated by open circles and open squares , corresponding to the same @xmath6 values .",
    "it is shown that differentially varying doppler boost of different patches of the fireball front provides an intrinsic , unavoidable smoothing mechanism for the spectra of gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows .",
    "the detailed smoothing patterns are complicated , depending upon various factors such as the evolution of the lorentz factor and the evolution of the intrinsic ( i.e. , comoving frame ) radiation spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , for plausible ranges of model parameters of interest , a comoving frame delta function spectrum at @xmath0 is smoothed to have a hwhm of @xmath1 , assuming that the time evolution of the characteristic frequency @xmath70 is proportional to some positive power of the shock front lorentz factor , @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ; see equation 8) .",
    "this type of smoothing may be applicable to continuous spectra such as from synchrotron mechanism .",
    "in the case @xmath50 ( appropriate for atomic line features which are independent of the blastwave dynamics ) , the spectral smoothing is smaller , with a hwhm of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a sharp linelike emission feature ( in the comoving frame ) would be smoothed out to have an equivalent width of about @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , the spectral profile of such a feature will be asymmetrical with a sharp cutoff at the high end ( see the two solid curves in figure 1 ) .",
    "two interesting and natural consequences arise due to the differential doppler smoothing .",
    "first , the observed spectra of grbs or their afterglows can not be steeper than @xmath2 with @xmath3 ( figure 1 ) , even though the intrinsic spectra in the comoving shock frame may be much steeper , if the circumburster medium is uniform and electron and magnetic energies are fixed fractions of the total post - shock energy with time .",
    "second , a generic fast - rise - slow - decay type temporal profile of the grb bursts is expected , not necessarily reflecting the intrinsic temporal profiles of the bursts in the comoving frame .",
    "this can be easily seen by considering the case where the intrinsic ( blastwave frame ) spectrum is a bivariate delta function in both time and frequency . in this case",
    "the fast rise occurs when the radiation from the region around @xmath54 enters the observer s finite band .",
    "subsequently , radiation from regions with gradually increasing @xmath6 is received at decreasing amplitudes in the same observer s finite band with a decaying time scale of @xmath74 ( in observer s frame ) .",
