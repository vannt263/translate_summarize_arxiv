    "at the heart of high  energy physics lies the desire to find the fundamental building blocks of matter and to understand how they make up our world .",
    "this is a very old quest that has made substantial progress only in the past 100 years with the advent of high  energy experiments , as the spatial resolution achieved in experiments is inversely proportional to the energy transfer .",
    "the picture that has emerged contains leptons ( like the electron ) , quarks ( that build up hadrons like the proton @xcite ) , and gauge bosons ( like the photon ) that mediate the four fundamental forces gravitation , electromagnetism , weak , and strong interactions . due to its weakness , gravitation can be disregarded in high  energy experiments .",
    "the first complete theory was formulated for electromagnetism . that theory , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , succeeded in describing all experimental data on electromagnetic interactions with a precision rivaled by no other theory to date",
    ". however , qed is not exactly solvable , it is solved in a perturbative expansion of its coupling constant @xmath9 . as that is of the order of 10@xmath10 , neglecting terms of @xmath11 or even @xmath12 introduces but a small uncertainty .",
    "because of its tremendous success , the concept of a perturbatively solvable field theory was adopted to formulate theories for the other forces as well . in this process",
    "the weak interactions turned out to be closely related to the electromagnetic ones , leading to a unification of the two theories to the theory of electroweak interactions @xcite .",
    "the field theory for the strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . like qed",
    "it can be solved only perturbatively ( the alternative lattice techniques are not applicable to the subject under study , at present , and are not discussed ) . in contrast to qed , however , the coupling constant @xmath13 is much larger , and the fundamental particles of the theory , the quarks , are only free in the limit of asymptotically high energies @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to small distances , i.e.  the quarks are not free on macroscopic scales but are confined inside hadrons made up of two or three quarks in the case of mesons or baryons , respectively .",
    "therefore , only part of the strong interactions can be calculated perturbatively , the confinement can not be computed from qcd ( yet ) , and its properties must be measured . for a number of high  energy reactions ,",
    "the hard and soft regions can be disentangled and treated separately .",
    "this is the content of the factorization theorem of qcd .",
    "the hard cross sections for parton scattering can then be calculated to fixed order in perturbation theory . beyond leading order , virtual corrections to the process under study",
    "must be taken into account , too .",
    "these give rise to singularities in certain regions of the phase space , as do the real corrections .",
    "for inclusive processes , the infrared and collinear singularities cancel when the real and virtual contributions are added @xcite .",
    "the remaining ultraviolet singularities are removed by wave function and coupling constant renormalization .    for semi",
    " inclusive processes this does not hold true anymore . in the case of single hadron production ,",
    "e.g. , the transition of the parton from a hard , quasi ",
    "free particle to confinement within the observed final ",
    "state hadron can not be calculated from perturbative qcd .",
    "it must be modeled by a phenomenological fragmentation function ( ff ) . because this function applies to a single parton , some ( collinear ) final ",
    "state singularities remain .",
    "these residual singularities are factored off into the bare , infinite ff , leading to finite partonic cross sections and finite fragmentation functions ( an analogous procedure applies to initial ",
    "state singularities and parton density functions , pdf s ) .",
    "inclusive particle production ( ipp ) is of particular interest for the investigation of qcd .",
    "it has been measured in a variety of processes and over a wide range of energies . due to the well defined final  state ,",
    "the measurements have small systematic errors and the observables are also unambiguously defined theoretically .",
    "this enables a test of qcd via two of its central properties : scaling violation and universality of factorization . as pointed out ,",
    "the ff s required for the calculation of hadron production cross sections are not calculable , but must be fitted to data .",
    "once this has been accomplished with the help of data of one specific process at one particular center  of  mass ( cm ) energy , the ff s so obtained can be applied to any process due to the universality of factorization .",
    "their scale dependence is determined by the altarelli ",
    "parisi splitting functions .",
    "the determination of these ff s from data , and their application in a number of phenomenological studies are the subjects of this thesis .",
    "the choice process for the extraction of ff s from data is @xmath0  annihilation . from the experimental viewpoint it is distinguished by an abundance of data that have been collected over the past fifteen years at energies from 3.6 to 91.2  gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the background is fully under control so that not only statistical but also systematical errors are very small . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the greatest advantage of @xmath0  annihilation is that no additional non  perturbative input is needed , avoiding possible bias in the determination of the ff s .",
    "moreover , the born approximation is of purely electroweak origin , i.e.  it is precisely known , and any deviation from it is due to the strong interaction .",
    "last but not least , the phase space integrations required for the calculation of single particle production are particularly easy for this process , owing to the simplicity of the initial state .",
    "this permits to perform the integration over phase space analytically ( which is not possible , e.g. , for @xmath8 scattering ) , speeding up the numerical evaluation of the cross section tremendously , which is crucial for fitting .    to salvage the most of the predictive power of qcd",
    "it is desirable to use data from one specific process only in extracting the ff s .",
    "one disadvantage of @xmath0  annihilation in this context is that gluons are not produced at lo , leading to a small contribution to the unpolarized cross section and consequently to little information on their fragmentation .",
    "however , the gluons do contribute a major part of the longitudinal cross section . from a comparison of this measurement with theory",
    "one can determine the gluon as well .",
    "until recently , the longitudinal cross section has been computed to lo accuracy only  which is @xmath1  introducing large scale dependences .",
    "the nlo ( @xmath4 ) corrections are required to reduce this uncertainty .",
    "the calculation of the relevant coefficient functions has been presented by p.j .",
    "rijken and w.l .  van neerven @xcite for the color classes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we confirm the results for the class @xmath17 and augment the results by the color class @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution from this class turns out to be numerically small .",
    "subsequently , we use the complete set of nlo longitudinal coefficient functions together with the nlo transverse coefficient functions to determine a set of charged hadron ff s to nlo that feature a better constrained gluon .",
    "although the transverse cross section has been calculated to nnlo @xcite , which is of order @xmath4 and hence formally of the same order as the longitudinal cross section to nlo , these higher orders are not included in the present analysis , as they would lead to inconsistency with the altarelli ",
    "parisi evolution kernels that are only known to nlo . for later use in consistent @xmath13",
    "fits to deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and photoproduction data , the new fit is performed for distinct values of @xmath18 .",
    "the range from @xmath19 to 400 mev is covered in 50 mev steps , our central choice is @xmath20  mev .",
    "in addition , a number of studies undertaken in the past years in collaboration with b.a .",
    "kniehl and g.  kramer will be reviewed in order to demonstrate the potential of inclusive particle production as a tool to test qcd in a variety of processes .",
    "specifically , we fitted charged pion and charged kaon fragmentation functions to data from tpc @xcite and to data from aleph @xcite .",
    "the novel data in @xcite for the sum over charged hadrons distinguished between different quark flavors .",
    "together with data on the gluon ff from opal @xcite , this enabled us to determine the ff s for individual flavors for the first time @xcite .",
    "we also presented sets of neutral kaon @xcite and @xmath21 meson ff s @xcite .",
    "owing to the universality of factorization , these ff s are applicable to any process .",
    "we employed them in photoproduction , @xmath8 , and @xmath22 scattering and found good agreement with data .",
    "the main emphasis was put on photoproduction , where very good data from hera are available for study @xcite . in particular",
    "the rapidity spectra have the potential to improve our knowledge of the gluon and charm content of the photon @xcite . in @xmath22 scattering ,",
    "nlo predictions for inclusive particle production at lep2 and at the nlc were presented for the first time @xcite .",
    "the thesis is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 contains a short review of the theoretical framework for using perturbative qcd and a discussion of the implications of the factorization theorem . in section  3 the process of @xmath0  annihilation",
    "is discussed with emphasis on the longitudinal cross section .",
    "sets of fragmentation functions for various mesons , extracted from @xmath0  annihilation data , are presented in section  4 , and with the help of the @xmath4 longitudinal coefficient functions a new set of particularly well constrained charged hadron ff s is obtained .",
    "subsequently , these sets are applied to test qcd , via scaling violation and the property of universality , in section  5 . a new approach to constraining the ( incalculable ) soft regime of qcd in the case of the photonic gluon and charm densities is also presented .",
    "the results are summarized in section  6 together with an outlook on the potential of future analyses .",
    "the strong coupling constant that usually serves as the expansion parameter in perturbative qcd becomes small only for short distances .",
    "this corresponds to high momenta so that the bound states of colored objects can not be calculated and the problem of confinement remains unsolved . to put perturbation theory to any use in qcd",
    ", the short  distance and long  distance processes therefore have to be separated . only for processes and experimental observables where this is feasible a comparison between perturbative qcd calculations and experimental data is possible .",
    "for this reason the factorization theorem of qcd that ensures the factorizability of hard and soft regions ( corresponding to short and long distances , respectively ) for a number of processes is crucial to any calculation in perturbative qcd .",
    "moreover it is of particular interest for this analysis where the non  perturbative fragmentation of partons into hadrons is treated expressly by the parametrization of the ignorance about the confinement into phenomenological functions .    in fig .",
    "[ factorization ] , the fragmentation process is represented by the large blob to the right .",
    "the double lines with the arrowheads represent hadrons in the initial or final state , the blob labeled * h * represents the calculable hard scattering and the small blobs in the initial state represent another non  perturbative ingredient required for some processes , namely parton density functions of hadrons .",
    "this schematic diagram shows the general features of factorization in any factorizable process .",
    "the large blob to the right may , however , also be taken to represent jet fragmentation instead of inclusive particle production .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein for details on the subject of jet production .",
    "the purpose of this section is to give a short account of the content of the factorization theorem and to discuss its consequences in some detail .",
    "the theorem will be employed in section  4 to fit ff s to data from @xmath0  annihilation and some of its implications will be used as rigorous tests of qcd when applying them in section  5 .",
    "a more detailed intuitive picture of factorization can be found in @xcite .",
    "the factorization theorem states that the soft and the hard parts of the cross section factorize ( in fourier space ) so that the cross section can be written as the convolution of a non  perturbative part with a perturbatively calculable hard scattering cross section .",
    "it holds in every renormalizable field theory for all leading twist two contributions , in particular , it has been proven in @xcite that the inclusive cross section for any hard process factorizes . to leading order , both the partonic , hard cross section and the ff s are finite . in higher orders , however ,",
    "singularities are generated through the real corrections .",
    "these are in part canceled by singularities in the virtual corrections that have to be added . due to the kinoshita  lee ",
    "nauenberg theorem , the cancellation works perfectly for inclusive quantities @xcite . for semi  inclusive observables , like inclusive particle production , residual singularities are factored off into the bare ff s .",
    "this is achieved with universal transition functions @xmath23 . in the dimensional regularization scheme",
    "@xcite the space  time dimension @xmath24 is taken slightly off the physical 4 dimensions in intermediate steps of the calculation .",
    "this procedure isolates the singularities as poles in @xmath25 .",
    "the transition functions have the general structure @xmath26                           + { \\cal o}\\left(\\overline{\\alpha}_s^2\\right ) { \\hspace{0.4cm}}{\\rm and } \\\\ \\gamma_{a\\to b}^{s } & { \\hspace*{-2.5mm}}={\\hspace*{-2.5 mm } } & \\delta_{ab } { \\rm \\bf 1 }                           -\\frac{1}{{\\varepsilon}}\\frac{\\overline{\\alpha}_s}{2\\pi }                           s_{{\\varepsilon}}\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{m_f^2}\\right)^{{\\varepsilon } }                           \\left [ p_{a\\to b}^{s(0 ) } + f_{a\\to b } \\right ]                           + { \\cal o}\\left(\\overline{\\alpha}_s^2\\right ) { \\hspace{0.1cm},}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are artefacts of dimensional regularization . @xmath29 defines the scale at which the divergences are subtracted .",
    "the unrenormalized strong coupling constant is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "dependence of the functions on variables is suppressed to simplify notation ; @xmath31 is shorthand for the @xmath32  function .",
    "the superscripts @xmath33 , @xmath34 stand for the timelike and the spacelike processes , respectively .",
    "the formul are fully analogous and as @xmath0  annihilation is timelike ( @xmath35 ) , only the timelike functions will be considered in the following . the superscript will be dropped for ease of notation .",
    "the @xmath36 functions specify the factorization scheme , the @xmath37scheme @xcite adopted in this work is defined by @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 .    up to order @xmath30 , the timelike @xmath23  functions in the @xmath37scheme",
    "are given by : @xmath41",
    "the singularities in the bare cross section @xmath42 are factored into the bare fragmentation functions @xmath43 according to @xmath44 and analogous equations @xmath45 for the ff s .",
    "the definition of the combinations @xmath46 and @xmath47 of ff s in the above equations will be given in the next section .",

    "one of the main results of the factorization theorem is that the functions parametrizing the non  perturbative part are process independent .",
    "this feature , known as universality of the ff s and the pdf s , is instrumental to the predictive power of qcd analyses .",
    "it is one of the most directly testable properties of qcd and one of the reasons for the phenomenological significance of inclusive particle production and ff s .    albeit , there are some caveats to the predictive power of the factorization theorem as applied in this work .",
    "\\(i ) as stated at the outset , the factorization theorem holds for leading twist two contributions , i.e.  for terms of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the results of present day perturbative calculations are correct at least in the limit @xmath52 . for any finite energy , higher twist of the order @xmath53 , @xmath54 may be important , too . for deep inelastic scattering it has been proven that the subleading twist is twist four , hence those contributions are suppressed by a relative factor of @xmath55 and may safely be neglected . in @xmath0",
    "annihilation , the situation is less clear as the subleading terms may be of @xmath56 for some observables .",
    "we demonstrated some time ago @xcite that present data on the unpolarized inclusive particle production do not necessitate the introduction of such terms as even the scaling violation , where they would show up most prominently , is in good agreement with data .",
    "this is demonstrated , for example , by fig .  [ scaling ] in section  5.2 .",
    "very recently , m.  dasgupta and b.r .",
    "webber @xcite calculated the corrections with the help of renormalon techniques and found that the @xmath56 is absent in unpolarized ipp cross sections also in @xmath0  annihilation . in the same work",
    "they also maintain that the longitudinal and transverse contributions separately do have @xmath57 contributions . the uncalculable coefficient of those contributions , however , is small and omitting such terms altogether is consistent with the data on @xmath58 @xcite at the 1.5  @xmath59 level .",
    "power corrections will thus be neglected throughout this work .",
    "some phenomenology of higher twist and power corrections in @xmath0  annihilation can be found in @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) how much of the cross section is factored into the non  perturbative functions is unequivocal only when the calculation is performed to all orders is an asymptotic series , i.e. does not converge . for the sake of the argument one may pretend it is a convergent series as only the first few orders will likely ever be calculable in practice , anyway . ] . for a finite order calculation the scale @xmath29 sets the point at which the infrared singularities are factored off , introducing an additional unphysical parameter in the results of the calculations",
    "the main reason why one needs to calculate at least the subleading order for most practical purposes is to reduce the dependence of the result on this scale ( and on related scales for the renormalization of the coupling , @xmath60 , and for the factorization of the initial state singularities , @xmath61 ) . in subleading order , called nlo in the following ( i.e.  nlo to a process that receives its leading contribution in @xmath62 is of order @xmath63 ) , the sensitivity to the choice of scales is reduced compared to the lo . for actual fits to data",
    "it is quite cumbersome to vary the scales as one has to produce a separate fit for every choice of scales . for this reason the discussion of scales in this work",
    "is limited to the demonstration of the reduced scale dependence in nlo versus lo calculations .",
    "in the actual fits and applications the renormalization scales and fragmentation scales will generally all be identified with an appropriate hard scale of the process . in @xmath0",
    "annihilation , there is only one hard scale , the virtuality of the intermediate vector boson , which somewhat reduces the ambiguity of choice of scales in this process .",
    "\\(iii ) last but not least , all particles , hadrons and partons alike , are treated as massless in this work . for the partons , the non ",
    "negligible masses of the @xmath64 and @xmath40 quarks are usually taken into account only via thresholds in the evolution of the ff s , according to the variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) @xcite . in the recent past ,",
    "also some massive calculations of cross sections have been performed @xcite . in this thesis ,",
    "the vfns philosophy is adopted . only for the heavy @xmath21 mesons",
    "this topic is considered in more detail and the factorization scheme is modified also to properly account for both the intermediate and high  energy regions . as for the hadrons , there is no easy way to account for their masses .",
    "the masses are thus taken to vanish throughout .",
    "for momenta that are large compared to all the masses involved , this simplification is well justified .",
    "however , when the momentum of the final  state hadron is of the same order as its mass , threshold effects arise and the massless results become unreliable .",
    "this is a general feature of all massless calculations and is also observed , e.g.  in jet production when approaching the boundary of phase space . in @xmath0",
    "annihilation the non  vanishing quark masses are important only for small virtualities of the photon .",
    "the finite hadron masses always become important at some point for production of a hadron with small momentum fraction @xmath65 , notably for heavy hadrons like @xmath21 or protons / antiprotons . on the other hand ,",
    "the methods employed traditionally for fitting and evolving ff s become unreliable for very small @xmath65 in any case .",
    "this is due to the large logarithms of @xmath66 that have to be resummed , eventually .",
    "the altarelli ",
    "parisi evolution thus becomes unreliable at some point and double  leading  logarithmic evolution equations are relevant instead @xcite . in an intermediate region of moderately small @xmath65 ,",
    "the description of the fragmentation process can be improved by the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) in connection with local parton hadron duality @xcite .",
    "this fundamental limitation of the traditional approach turns up as a singularity in differential nlo cross sections at @xmath67 . in this work ,",
    "@xmath68 in the range 0.05 ... 0.20 will be taken as lower limit for the validity of the massless approach .",
    "the fragmentation functions that have been introduced in the previous subsection are non  perturbative .",
    "they can not be calculated , at present , but must be taken from data at some scale @xmath69 .",
    "their evolution to other scales , however , is then determined by perturbative qcd . in this subsection",
    ", we will present the equations governing the evolution of ff s . for brevity",

    "<S> finally , we suggest how the improved knowledge on the fragmentation in particular of the gluon could be used to determine the gluon and charm content of the photon . </S>"
