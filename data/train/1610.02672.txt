    "whenever a polytope is invariant under a transformation such as duality , we often describe this as an `` external '' symmetry of the polytope . in the context of abstract regular polytopes ,",
    "self - duality manifests as an automorphism of the symmetry group of the polytope . for example",
    ", the @xmath3-simplex is self - dual , and this fact is reflected by an automorphism of its symmetry group @xmath4 .",
    "since the symmetric group @xmath4 has no nontrivial outer automorphisms ( unless @xmath5 ) , we see that in general the self - duality of the simplex must somehow correspond to an ordinary rank - preserving symmetry .",
    "what does this mean geometrically ?",
    "what other polytopes have this property that self - duality yields an inner automorphism ?    in this paper , we define a regular self - dual abstract polytope to be _ internally self - dual _ if the group automorphism induced by its self - duality is an inner automorphism .",
    "otherwise , a regular self - dual polytope is _ externally self - dual_. our search for internally self - dual regular polytopes started with the atlas of regular polytopes with up to 2000 flags @xcite . using a computer algebra system , we found the following results on the number of regular polytopes ( up to isomorphism and duality ) .",
    ".data on dualities of small regular polytopes [ marstondata ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by design , @xmath6 is self - dual , since interchanging every label @xmath7 with @xmath8 is a symmetry of the graph , corresponding to a reflection through a line that goes through the middle edge ( if @xmath3 is odd ) or through the middle node ( if @xmath3 is even ) .",
    "let us show that @xmath6 is internally self - dual .",
    "first , when @xmath3 is odd and @xmath9 , the permutation @xmath10 interchanges the two nodes that are incident on the middle edge , while fixing everything else .",
    "then , setting @xmath11 , we get that @xmath12 interchanges the next two nodes from the center , while fixing everything else . continuing this way , we can find permutations @xmath13 that each interchange a node with its dual while fixing everything else .",
    "the product of all of these will be a dualizing automorphism in @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath3 is even and @xmath14 , the middle node is incident to edges labeled @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the permutation @xmath17 is easily seen to interchange the two nodes that are incident on the middle node , while fixing everything else . then , setting @xmath18 , we get that @xmath12 interchanges the two nodes at a distance of 2 from the middle node , while fixing everything else . as in the odd case , we can continue to define permutations @xmath19 that each interchange a node with its dual , and the product of all of these will be a dualizing automorphism in @xmath6 .",
    "now we need to show that each @xmath6 is a string c - group .",
    "it is clear that it is a string group generated by involutions , so we only need to show that it satisfies the intersection condition .",
    "we will do this utilizing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2e16 ) by showing that its facet group and vertex figure group are string c - groups , and that their intersection is what is needed .",
    "we will take advantage of the fact that @xmath6 is self - dual by design , so the structure of each of its parabolic subgroups is the same as the  dual \" subgroup . for any subset @xmath20 of @xmath21",
    ", we define @xmath22 .",
    "the structure of @xmath23 is determined by the structure of the given permutation representation graph after we delete all edges with labels in @xmath20 .",
    "for example , the group @xmath24 yields a permutation representation graph with a chain with labels @xmath25 through @xmath26 , along with four isolated components ; two labeled @xmath25 and two labeled @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that this is the group obtained from a simplex by mixing with an edge , dualizing , and mixing with another edge .",
    "it is a string c - group which is isomorphic to @xmath27 .",
    "the groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 are maximal parabolic subgroups of the group obtained by mixing a string c - group from lemma  [ n-3plus ] with an edge .",
    "both of these groups are thus string c - groups , and can be shown to be isomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the groups @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both described by lemma  [ n-3plus ] .",
    "they each are string c - groups isomorphic to @xmath33 .",
    "each group @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the mix of a group from lemma  [ n-3plus ] with an edge , and can be shown to be isomorphic to @xmath36 .",
    "now , to show that @xmath37 is a string c - group , we use the fact that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are string c - groups acting on three orbits , and as a symmetric group on the largest orbit .",
    "the intersection of these two groups can not be any larger than the direct product of two groups of order two with the symmetric group acting on the points shared by the large orbits of both groups .",
    "this is exactly the structure of @xmath38 , so @xmath37 is a string c - group .",
    "similarly , we show that @xmath39 is a string c - group ( the result then follows for @xmath40 , by self - duality ) .",
    "since both @xmath34 and @xmath37 are string c - groups , we just need to show that their intersection is @xmath41 .",
    "this is true following the same logic as above , analyzing the orbits of each subgroup .",
    "also , following lemma  [ n-4plus ] , @xmath39 is a symmetric group extended by a single transposition .",
    "furthermore , since element @xmath42 fixes all the nodes of the connected component of the graph of @xmath39 , and interchanges the nodes of the isolated edge labeled 2 , it follows that this single transposition is in the group @xmath39 .",
    "thus @xmath43 .",
    "finally , @xmath6 is a string c - group since both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are string c - groups , and @xmath44 is maximal in @xmath43 .",
    "some problems on the existence of internally self - dual polytopes remain open . here",
    "are perhaps the most fundamental .    for each odd @xmath45 , describe an infinite family of internally self - dual regular polyhedra of type @xmath0 , or prove that there are only finitely many internally self - dual regular polyhedra of that type .",
    "determine the values of @xmath2 and @xmath46 such that there is an internally self - dual regular @xmath47-polytope of type @xmath48 .    determine whether each self - dual @xmath49-polytope occurs as the medial section of an internally self - dual regular @xmath3-polytope .",
    "to our knowledge , these problems are open even if we consider all self - dual regular polytopes , rather than just the internally self - dual ones .    to what extent does the theory we have developed apply to transformations other than duality ? for example , the _ petrie dual _ of a polyhedron @xmath50 , denoted @xmath51 ,",
    "is obtained from @xmath50 by interchanging the roles of its facets and its petrie polygons ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath52 , then we say that @xmath50 is _ self - petrie_. if @xmath50 is regular , with @xmath53 , then @xmath50 is self - petrie if and only if there is a group automorphism of @xmath54 that sends @xmath55 to @xmath56 , while fixing @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we can then say that @xmath50 is _ internally self - petrie _ if this automorphism is inner .    working with internally self - petrie polyhedra",
    "is not substantially different from working with internally self - dual polyhedra , due to the following result .",
    "a regular polyhedron @xmath50 is internally self - petrie if and only if @xmath59 is internally self - dual .",
    "suppose that @xmath50 is ( internally or externally ) self - petrie , and let @xmath60 .",
    "then there is some @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "now , @xmath65 , and then @xmath66 . then it is easy to show that @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "it follows that @xmath59 is self - dual .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath69 as abstract groups and @xmath70 induces the self - petriality of the former and the self - duality of the latter , it follows that @xmath70 is either inner for both groups or outer for both .",
    "the result then follows .",
    "perhaps there are other transformations of polytopes where it would make sense to discuss internal versus external invariance under that transformation .",
    "the computations done in this paper were verified independently using gap @xcite and magma @xcite .",
