    "an attractive feature of nanostructures is their great accessibility to single quantum states due to their apparent quantization , which allows us to develop unconventional photo - functions owing to the flexible controllability of the light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the light - matter interaction of a single quantum state is essentially weak because of the localization of its wavefunction .",
    "an effective method for overcoming the small reaction cross - section of a single quantum state is utilizing auxiliary systems such as microcavities or optical antennas made with metallic structures , where the extremely localized photonic modes realize a high probability of excitation of the single quantum states by a few photons @xcite .",
    "an other solution involves the realization of spatially extended quantum states .",
    "a large coherent volume due to the collective dipole motions leads to an enhanced oscillator strength @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coherence length of excitonic center - of - mass ( cm ) motions reaches several hundreds of nano meters in the one - dimensional confined system .",
    "this situation yields a large exciton - radiation coupling because the multipole - type excitons with the cm quantum number @xmath1 can match their spatial phase with the radiation wave@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the optical responses based on the conventional long - wavelength approximation ( lwa ) of light , this type of interaction exhibits remarkable optical effects such as a large radiative shift leading to the interchange of the quantized levels @xcite and ultrafast radiative decay @xcite .",
    "such exciton  radiation - coupling beyond the lwa strongly modifies the optical spectra relative to those expected from bare excitonic systems , and the interpretation of the spectral shape becomes complex .",
    "although numerous studies have been performed on the excitonic properties in the thin film geometry @xcite , efforts to exploit the potential of light - matter coupling beyond the lwa regime have only just begun , and the unresolved physics and potential applications of excitons in promising materials offer scope for further research .",
    "nanostructures of zno have attracted the attention of researchers because of their potential applications in optoelectronic devices operable even at room temperature ( rt ) , such as light - emitting diodes @xcite , ultraviolet photovoltaics @xcite , and exciton polariton lasing @xcite utilizing the wide band gap and large exciton binding energy .",
    "although the formation of an exciton  radiation - coupled system is a key to the exploitation of such applications , even the fundamental structures of the coupled modes were previously unclear . in recent years",
    ", however , we revealed that the radiation - induced coupling between a and b excitons in thin film structures enhances the radiative decay rate of particular coupled states @xcite .",
    "this result motivates us to exploit coherent nonlinear photo - functions such as ultrafast optical switching at rt because the enhanced decay rates can be expected to exceed the thermal dephasing at rt @xcite ( typically several tens of or several hundreds of femto - seconds ) .",
    "herein , by considering two polarization directions of light , we expand the nonlocal response theory of multicomponent excitons @xcite and investigate the optical kerr response ( okr ) , which is known as a typical third - order nonlinear optical effect .",
    "then , we demonstrate that a particular a - b - coupled state in zno with an enhanced radiative width of over 50 mev dominantly survives in the okr signals , even under a massive nonradiative damping @xmath0 mev . the incident pulse width and the film - thickness dependence of the integrated intensity of nonlinear signals clearly show that there is an optimal combination between these two parameters for enhancing the optical nonlinearity .",
    "the results indicate the importance of an integrated design of nanostructures and an input optical pulse for maximizing the veiled potential of single quantum states for ultrafast nonlinear optics .",
    "the presented demonstrations exhibit a striking contrast to the conventional understandings of excitons , where the coherent nonlinear response is considered to be negligible at rt because the radiative decay rate of excitons never exceeds the thermal dephasing .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : section [ 2 ] outlines the theory of nonlocal optical response for deriving the radiative decay time of the exciton  radiation - coupled system .",
    "section [ 3 ] demonstrates the optical kerr spectra considering two kinds of temperature regions : cryogenic temperature ( ct ) and rt . in sec . [ 4 ] , we investigate the pulse width and film thickness dependences of nonlinear signals to determine the optimal pulse width for each film thickness .",
    "the results and discussions in this article are summarized in sec . [ 5 ] .",
    "beyond the lwa regime , the interplay between the spatial structures of the radiation and excitonic wavefunction is activated .",
    "recently , we constructed a theoretical framework for the nonlocal optical response of multicomponent excitons in a thin  film structure with special attention to their self - consistency @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we review the formalism of the linear response to obtain a full understanding of exciton  radiation coupled modes and the origin of fast radiative decay . as a model system",
    ", we considered a thin - film structure with a thickness of @xmath2 along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the thickness is assumed to be far greater than the effective bohr radius of an exciton ; thus , the excitonic relative motion can be treated in the same way as that in the bulk system . in this condition , only the cm motion of excitons is confined in the sample .",
    "we neglect the confinement effect of the relative motions of electron  hole pair , which dominantly contributes to the energy structure of excitons in the size region where the thickness reaches the effective bohr radius @xcite ( 1.8 nm for zno @xcite ) . according to the standard effective - mass approximation",
    ", the eigenenergy of the bare exciton is given as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an index for labeling multiple exciton bands ( thus , @xmath5 corresponds to a or b in the case of zno ) , @xmath6 is the energy of a transverse exciton in the bulk limit , and @xmath7 is the effective mass of an exciton . in a thin sample ,",
    "the distortion of wavefunctions near the surface generally affects the energy structures of excitons .",
    "we therefore applied a microscopic transition layer model @xcite as the excitonic cm wavefunction @xmath8 . in this model , the quantization condition is given as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is a decay constant of evanescent waves with a value on the order of the inverse of the effective bohr radius , indicating the distortion length . in this paper , we fix these values as the effective bohr radius ( @xmath13 nm ) because the optical signal is not sensitive to a change in @xmath12 for a thickness beyond the lwa regime @xcite , although for thin samples in the lwa regime , @xmath12 is one of the important parameters for accurate analysis of the cm quantization as demonstrated in ref .",

    "we focus on the dominant contribution , i.e. , the effects of the one - exciton resonance , while avoiding non - essential issues of two - exciton contributions @xcite .",
    "elaborate analysis considering the free two - exciton states through the cancellation effect @xcite is necessary for evaluating the absolute values of okr signals , although we do not consider it in the present study .",

    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ x3 ] ) has the same form as the case of the dfwm in eq .",
    "( 19 ) in ref .",
    "generally , the okr and the dfwm are different nonlinear processes ; thus , the combination of incident frequencies changes for each process .",

    "the observed dfwm frequency is @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , if we use the combination of @xmath49 and @xmath50 as the observed frequency instead of @xmath51 , the expression for the denominator of the triple - resonance term has a different form for each process .",

    "the 120-fs input pulses can cover a certain range of spectral width and partially excite the lower ( @xmath64<e_a$ ] ) , middle ( @xmath65\\le e_b$ ] ) , and upper ( @xmath66 $ ] ) branches of exciton  radiation - coupled modes at once .",
    "the energy and spectral width of the signals obviously reflect the eigenenergy and radiative width . in the case",
    "where @xmath67 mev ( ct region ) , the eigenmodes with a radiative width larger than 2 mev dominantly appear ; thus , large splitting between the lower and upper peaks is obvious in the spectrum . on the other hand , the eigenmodes with a radiative width smaller than 2 mev",
    "are less reflected in the spectrum because of the damping effect . here ,",
    "each of the two peaks at the ct should not be attributed solely to the a or b exciton according to their energy position .",
    "these two peaks should be assigned to respective mixed modes containing both a and b excitons owing to the radiative coupling @xcite .    with an increase in thermal damping @xmath18 ,",
    "these two peaks disappear , and only one mode with a very broad spectral width appears ( red line ) .",
    "the radiative width of this mode is larger than 50 mev ; thus , a large nonlinear signal can survive even at @xmath68 mev ( rt region ) because the response is faster than the nonradiative damping under this condition .    in the aforementioned discussions",
    ", the 120-fs input pulse may not be very effective for maximizing the nonlinear intensity , because it can not cover the entire radiative width of the fastest mode . additionally , there are dependences of the input pulse width and the film thickness on the output nonlinear intensities . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate how the nonlinear intensity can be maximized by changing these parameters .",
    "to evaluate the intensity of the okr signals , we defined the nonlinear efficiency @xmath69 as the ratio of the integrated intensity of the input probe light to that of the output y - polarized one , as follows :    @xmath70     for a film thickness of 291 nm.,width=321 ]    figure [ pulse_width ] shows the pulse - width dependence of the nonlinear efficiency @xmath69 for a film thickness of @xmath71 nm . the value of @xmath69 is maximized when the input pulse effectively covers the peak structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( a ) . in the case where @xmath67 mev ( ct region ) , the upper and lower modes are relatively dominant compared with the fastest decay mode .",
    "therefore , nearly 40-fs pulses are optimal .",
    "pulses that are too short are not effective because of the loss of energy .    on the other hand , in the case where @xmath68 mev ( rt region ) , the fastest decay mode with a radiative width over 50 mev ( radiative decay time reaching several femto seconds ) dominantly survives in the optical responses .",
    "in this situation , a shorter input with a nearly 15-fs pulse width is more effective for covering the very broad radiative width . the nonlinear efficiency is enhanced by a factor of 10 compared with that of the 120-fs pulse excitation .",
    "significantly , the high damping does not greatly reduce the nonlinear efficiency for nearly 15-fs input pulses , although the damping is 15 times greater than that at ct .",
    "this is because the radiative width of the fastest mode is far larger than @xmath18 and less affected by the thermal damping effects .",
    "according to these results , we expect compatibility between fast and strong nonlinear responses caused by short - pulse excitation in the rt region .",
    "we demonstrate this by comparing the radiative decay time @xmath36 and the nonlinear efficiency @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ integral ] shows the film - thickness dependences of ( a ) @xmath72 and ( b ) @xmath69 with different pulse widths at @xmath68 mev .",
    "these figures reveal two particularly noteworthy points .",
    "( 1 ) the optimal pulse width depends on the film thickness .",
    "this is because the radiative width of the exciton  radiation - coupled mode is determined according to the interaction volume ( film thickness ) between the exciton and radiation field .",
    "therefore , when the radiative decay time becomes far shorter than the input pulse width with an increase in the film thickness , the nonlinear efficiency decreases .",
    "( 2 ) in the case of the 10-fs pulse , similarly to the tendency of the radiative decay times , the nonlinear efficiency increases with the film thickness . in particular ,",
    "the local minimal values of the radiative decay time and maximal values of the nonlinear efficiency occur around the same thickness , indicating that the fast radiative decay of excitons becomes compatible with the sufficient nonlinear responses if an appropriate film thickness and input pulse width are selected .",
    "of exciton  radiation - coupled modes , and ( b ) the nonlinear efficiency @xmath69 with different pulse widths at @xmath68 mev.,width=321 ]    for a thickness region less than 80 nm in length , the nonlinear efficiency is weak .",
    "however , around this thickness , where the speed of radiative - decay exceeds that of dephasing , the growth of the nonlinear efficiency becomes rapid even in the case of @xmath68 mev .",
    "for zno , this occurs in a relatively thin region because particular exciton  radiation - coupled modes exhibit a larger radiative width owing to the radiative coupling of the a and b excitons .",
    "with the a and b excitons in zno , we theoretically investigated the radiative decay times of the exciton  radiation - coupled modes and their nonlinear optical responses by pulse excitation , focusing on the optical kerr effect . because of the large radiative coupling of excitons , particular modes exhibit large radiative widths over 50 mev ( short radiative decay times reaching several femto seconds ) , which can exceed the typical thermal damping at rt .",
    "this is why such modes survive in coherent nonlinear optical signals such as the okr in the case of a large damping parameter in the rt region .",
    "then , we demonstrated the pulse - width dependence of the nonlinear efficiency ( defined as the ratio of the integrated intensity of the input light to that of the output light ) , which is expected to increase when the input pulse effectively covers the broad radiative widths of the exciton  radiation - coupled modes .",
    "we discovered that the optimal short pulse enhanced the nonlinear efficiency with sufficient values even at rt , compared with those in the ct region .",
    "furthermore , the film - thickness dependence of the radiative decay times and nonlinear efficiency clearly indicate the possibility of compatibility between the fast and strong nonlinear responses obtained by choosing an appropriate film thickness and input pulse width .",
    "the presented results draw a contrast to conventional observations of the optical responses of excitons , where a coherent nonlinear response is considered to be never prominent at rt , because the thermal dephasing is far faster than the typical radiative decay of excitons .",
