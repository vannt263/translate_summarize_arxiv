    "a number of studies indicate a direct correlation between this anomalous behavior of the parameters and band structure evolution with copper content increase  @xcite .",

    "there it was observed that a new structure arises in the optical spectra ( a broad absorption maximum peaking at 4 ev ) while the cu content increases .",

    "a calculations of the electronic structure of tbni@xmath0cu@xmath1 ( @xmath2 0 , 1 , 2 ) were performed within the linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method  @xcite .",
    "the program package tb - lmto - asa ( tight - binding lmto together with atomic spheres approximation ) v.  47 was employed  @xcite .",

    "we perform calculations for different possible positions of copper ions for chosen doping level @xmath3 . assuming that each possible cu position has the same weight we then average obtained partial densities of ni and cu-3d states with following ratios for corresponding ni wickhoff positions : for @xmath5 i.e. one copper ion 2(2c):3(3 g ) and @xmath17 , two cu ions , 1(2c):3(3g):6(2c+3 g ) .    in our lsda+u calculations",
    "collinear ferromagnetic order of the local magnetic moments on all lattice sites was chosen .",

    "structure of these dos for different x is rather similar to each other and agrees with ref .   for stoichiometric tbni@xmath7 .",
    "it is seen that the main spectral weight is located below the fermi level .",
    "the 3d states of ni1 and ni2 form the wide bands extending from 4.0 to 0.5 ev .",
    "the 3d states of cu1 and cu2 bands for the compounds with x=1,2 are located in the energy range -4@xmath9 - 6 ev below e@xmath10 .",
    "their width is considerably smaller with respect to ni-3d states .",
    "the 4f - states of tb ion for majority spin are located below -6  ev and for minority at about 1.5  ev .",
    "calculated lsda+u band structures presented in the previous section are used to interpret experimental optical data  @xcite for the systems under consideration . in order to calculate theoretical interband optical conductivity @xmath20 we applied a rather simplified technique  @xcite using approximation , that the direct and indirect ( involving phonons ) interband transitions are equally probable .",
    "namely we computed @xmath20 like the integral function based on the convolution of the density of states located both below and above the @xmath21 .",
    "the electronic transitions of the d@xmath22f type are not observed in the calculation due to their low probability .",
    "this technique was already successively applied by us to intermetallic r@xmath23fe@xmath24 compounds  @xcite .    from total lsda+u dos presented on upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one can observe decrease of total dos on the fermi level @xmath6 with cu doping .",
    "it happens because for x=0 @xmath6 consists mostly of ni-3d states . with doping number of ni ions",
    "goes down while newly introduced cu ions do not contribute to the @xmath6 ( see lower panel of fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) . as follows from above",
    "mentioned static conductivity ( drude peak height ) it goes down with doping .",
    "it agrees with lowering of @xmath6 in our lsda+u calculations since conductivity is proportional to @xmath6 . in its turn plasma frequency",
    "is also proportional to @xmath6 and thus should decrease with cu doping . on the other hand substitution of ni for cu",
    "adds one electron to the system and increases number of carriers .",
    "plasma frequency squared is proportional to the number of carriers ( in the simplest drude - like picture ) and then should grow with cu doping .",
    "these two competing tendencies lead to the non monotonic doping behavior of plasma frequency recently observed experimentally in ref .  .",
    "at energies above 0.7 ev the shape of @xmath26 dispersion indicates the dominant role of interband absorption .",
    "the wide absorption region is characterized by structures , which intensities and localizations depend on the compound composition .",
    "the optical conductivity of the tbni@xmath7 binary alloy ( upper curve ) exhibit two peaks at photon energies 1.15 and 1.9 ev respectively . in the tbni@xmath30cu",
    "compound the @xmath26 spectrum is almost the same ; we can only note that the minimum between these structures is less pronounced . with a further increase in the cu content ( @xmath17 ) a new fairly broad absorption band arises at energies 3 - 4.5 ev .",
    "corresponding theoretical optical conductivity curves @xmath20 shows evolution upon substitution of nickel with copper similar to experimental one .",
    "theoretical calculations reproduce qualitatively the basic features of the experimental spectra , namely , two - peak structure at 1 - 2.5 ev , associated with the ni  3d interband transitions .",
    "the depth about 1.5  ev is getting closed .",
    "high energy tail above 3  ev becomes smoother with doping increase and for @xmath17 one can see the formation of the `` cu - states '' peak at about 5  ev .",
    "somewhat higher energy position of leading interband absorption edge ( about 1 ev ) might come from uncertainties in computation of @xmath31 value .",
    "in this work we perform _",
    "ab  initio _ lsda+u computations of electronic structure of intermetallic isostructural alloys tbni@xmath0cu@xmath1 ( @xmath2 0 , 1 , 2 ) .",
    "disorder effects of ni for cu substitution were accounted in a combinatorial way .",
    "corresponding averaged over all possible cu positions for given doping level x dos are further used to compute theoretical optical conductivity .",
    "here we is theoretically explain how experimental optical conductivity line shape changes with doping .",
    "analyzing lsda+u calculated dos one can find that responsible for the structures of optical conductivities at 1 - 2 ev electronic states are predominantly ni-3d states , while at @xmath94 - 5  ev there are cu-3d states .",
    "amount of latter ones increases upon doping giving rise to the structure at 4 - 5 ev in optical conductivity .",
    "one should note also good semiquantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental data .",
    "finally in this work we give explanation of the experimentally observed maximum of plasma frequency for x=1@xcite as competition of lowering of @xmath6 and simultaneous growing of number of carriers with ni for cu substitution .",
