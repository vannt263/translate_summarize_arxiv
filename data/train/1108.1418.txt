    "the large majority of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) contain no detectable volatile ices on their surfaces , but a small number of the largest objects have been found to have signatures of ch@xmath0 , co , or n@xmath1 , all ices with high vapor pressures at kuiper belt temperatures .",
    "after the discovery of volatiles on the surfaces of eris @xcite , makemake @xcite , and sedna , @xcite proposed a simple method for assessing the possibility of volatile retention on kbos .",
    "for each relevant ice , they compared the volatile loss due to jean s escape  the slowest of many possible escape mechanisms  to the total volatile inventory of the object and divided the kuiper belt into objects which could and could not have retained that ice over the age of the solar system .",
    "only a handful of objects are massive enough or cold enough to be able to retain volatiles .",
    "their model provided a compelling explanation of the low abundance of n@xmath1 on makemake @xcite , which is smaller than pluto and eris , and was also used to successfully predict the presence of methane on quaoar @xcite . to date , the volatile retention model has been completely successful predicting which objects will and which will not have detectable surface volatiles , with the unique exception being the large kbo haumea , which is the parent body of the only collisional family known in the kuiper belt @xcite and clearly had an unusual history .",
    "we provide an update to the @xcite calculations in figure 1 .",
    "we have used new vapor pressure data from and , where possible , have used measured sizes and masses of the largest kbos . for quaoar ,",
    "the current measured diameter is 890 @xmath2 70 km implying a density of 4.2 @xmath2 1.3 g @xmath3 @xcite , but we assume the upper limit of size as the smaller sizes lead to physically implausible densities .",
    "( note that even for the smaller size and higher density , however , quaoar is still expected to retain surface methane . )",
    "the size of 2007 or10 is unmeasured , so , as will be justified below , we assume that it has an albedo identical to the 0.18 albedo of quaoar that gives the size that we assume above , though we allow albedo uncertainties of 50% in either direction .",
    "as in @xcite , we calculate an `` equivalent temperature '' for each object by integrating the volatile loss through the object s entire orbit and determining the temperature that an object in a circular orbit would have to have to lose the volatile at that rate .    for our assumed albedo range ,",
    "2007 or10 is somewhere between the fourth and seventh largest object known in the kuiper belt .",
    "its potential size spans the range between the small volatile poor objects and the handful of volatile rich objects .",
    "2007 or10 is thus an excellent test object for our understanding of volatile retention in the outer solar system .",
    "we explore the surface composition of this object below using a combination of near - ir spectroscopy and multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "the low - resolution , near - infrared spectrum of 2007 or10 was obtained on 2010 september 20 ( ut ) using the folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ) spectrograph on the 6.5 m magellan baade telescope @xcite .",
    "fire s prism - dispersed mode provides continuous coverage of the 0.852.45  @xmath4 band with a variable resolution of @xmath5 = 250350 .",
    "2007 or10 was acquired and its motion confirmed using fire s @xmath6-band imaging channel .",
    "the source was maintained on the 0@xmath76 slit by manual corrections to sidereal tracking .",
    "two series of abba dither exposure sequences were obtained with integrations of 120  s at an average airmass of 1.04 .",
    "these were followed by a single abba sequence of the g2  v star hd  211544 ( @xmath8=10.9 ) at a similar airmass .",
    "exposures of a quartz flat field lamp ( set at 1.2  v and 2.2  v ) and arc lamps ( near ) were obtained for pixel response and wavelength calibration .",
    "data were reduced using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was converted into relative reflectance as well as corrected for telluric absorption and instrument response by dividing the raw spectrum of 2007 or10 by the spectrum of the solar type star hd  211544 .",
    "photometry were obtained with the wide - field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope during cycles 17 ( go program 11644 ) and 18 ( go program 12234 ) . in cycle 17 ,",
    "two 130 s exposures were taken in the f606w and f814w filters , and two 453 s exposures were taken in the f139 m , and f153 m filters . during the cycle 18 observations , two exposures were acquired in each of the f606w , f775w , f098 m , f110w with exposure times of 128s , 114s , 115s , and 207 s respectively . as well , four exposures of 275 s were acquired in the f127 m filter . for both the cycle 17 and 18 observations , 3 \" dithers were applied between image pairs to reduce the effects of cosmic rays and pixel defects , with the exception of the f127 m observations , in which 2 images were taken at each dither position .",
    "all observations in a cycle were acquired within a single orbit , minimizing the effect of any light curve or10 may have .",
    "all data were processed through calwfc3 version 2.3 , the standard wfc3 image processing pipeline @xcite .",
    "circular apertures were used to measure the photometry . _",
    "tiny tim _ version 7.1 psfs @xcitewere used to generate infinite aperture corrections as well as interpolate over any bad pixels flagged during the image reductions .",
    "fluxes were converted to relative reflectance by comparing to fluxes computed using the the _ calcphot _ routine for a model solar spectrum @xcite provided as part of the _ iraf _ package _ stsdas.synphot_. approximate absolute reflectances were then obtained by scaling the f606w relative reflectance to a value of 0.18 , our assumed albedo of 2007 or10 .",
    "all are shown in table 1 . before calculating relative reflectances ,",
    "the cycle 18 magnitudes were adjusted upward by 0.03 to account for the difference in the f606w magnitudes between the two epochs .",
    "the small magnitude difference is an expected consequence of object rotation .",
    "cccc    cycle 17 + f606w & 21.68@xmath2 0.02 & -27.00 & 0.18 + f814w & 21.39@xmath2 0.01 & -26.54 & 0.37 + f139 m & 22.06@xmath2 0.01 & -25.34 & 0.59 + f153 m & 22.47@xmath2 0.02 & -25.09 & 0.51 + cycle 18 + f606w & 21.65@xmath20.02 & -27.00 & 0.18 + f775w & 21.32@xmath20.02 & -26.64 & 0.34 + f098 m & 21.37@xmath20.01 & -26.13 & 0.52 + f110w & 21.62@xmath20.02 & -25.78 & 0.58 + f127 m & 21.84@xmath20.01 & -25.54 & 0.58 +",
    "figure 2 shows the fire reflectance spectrum with the wfc3 photometric points overlaid .",
    "we scale all point to an albedo of 0.18 in the f606w filter , though we note that the true value of the albedo has not been measured . to increase the signal - to - noise in the fire spectrum",
    ", we also plot the median of every 32 spectral channels , oversampled by a factor of two , to simulate how the spectrum would appear to a lower resolution spectrograph .",
    "uncertainties on these data points are obtained by calculating the median absolute deviation of eache 32 channel sample , which we multiply by 1.48 to obtain what would be the standard deviation in a normally distributed sample , and then divide by the square root of the number of spectral channels , approximating the standard deviation .    the fire spectrum and the wfc3 photometry are in broad agreement in the area of overlap , though the match is imperfect .",
    "we suspect that the differences are due to differential refraction in the fire data , which , for these early attempts at tracking a moving object , were not obtained with the slit aligned along the parallactic angle .",
    "both data sets show , in particular , a very red optical slope and a distinct absorption around 1.5 @xmath9 m .",
    "the fire spectrum shows an additional broad absorption feature near 2.0 @xmath9 m and , potentially , additional features redward .",
    "absorptions at 1.5 and 2.0 @xmath9 m are the characteristics features of water ice , which is frequently found on the largest kbos @xcite .",
    "figure 3 compares the spectrum of 2007 or10 to a modeled spectrum of a surface consisting of a mixture of water ice and a neutral material .",
    "we place no special significance on the precise water ice surface model , as many different types of specific parameters yield similar modeled spectra , but , for concreteness we use the water ice absorption coefficients of @xcite and construct a simple hapke model @xcite with 50@xmath9 m grains at 50 k spatially mixed with equal amounts of a neutral material with an albedo of 80% .",
    "the model spectrum is sampled at the same resolution as the smoothed spectrum of the object . even at the low signal - to - noise ratio of the data",
    ", the water ice model provides an excellent match to the spectrum redward of 1.4 @xmath9 m . at shorter wavelengths , however , 2007 or10 is significantly redder than water ice .",
    "most of the kbos with significant water ice absorption , such as orcus , haumea , and the haumea family members , have nearly neutral optical colors @xcite .",
    "the most notable exception to this trend is quaoar , which has water ice absorptions nearly identical in depth to those of 2007 or10 and is almost as red .",
    "a spectrum of quaoar @xcite over the same wavelength range is shown , for comparison , in figure 3 .",
    "the coloring of quaoar was suggested by @xcite to be due to the effects of methane , which turns red with irradiation @xcite .",
    "quaoar , as seen in figure 1 , is barely large enough or cold enough to retain methane on its surface and the amount left is small and detectable only at high signal - to - noise .",
    "2007 or10 , depending on its precise size , could be in a similar regime of volatile retention as quaoar .",
    "if true , the quaoar - like optical color of 2007 or10 could be a signature of the retention and irradiation of methane on the kbo . indeed , if 2007 or10 is assumed to have the same albedo as quaoar  as the close match in visible and near - infrared spectra might suggest ",
    "2007 or10 sits in almost precisely the same volatile loss regime as quaoar .",
    "while the perihelion distance of 2007 or10 of only 33.6 au ( compared to quaoar s of 41.6 au ) makes it significantly hotter than quaoar , the significantly larger size of 2007 or10 allows its larger gravitational pull to nonetheless potentially retain methane .",
    "if the hypothesis that the extreme red coloration on 2007 or10 is  like that of quaoar  caused by the irradiation of a small amount of remaining surface methane is correct , we predict that methane absorption should be visible on 2007 or10 as it is on quaoar .",
    "figure 3 also shows a simple model of a surface including solid methane and a neutral component .",
    "the model is simply the water model from above but with the absorption coefficients of methane @xcite replacing those of water .",
    "the spectrum is shifted upward by 0.3 units for clarity .",
    "the strongest absorption feature of methane , at 2.3 @xmath9 m does indeed correspond with a large variation from the water ice model .",
    "we conclude that while these data do not have sufficient signal - to - noise , particularly in the k - band , to positively detect methane on 2007 or10 , the existence of this volatile is plausible , and would provide a pleasing explanation for the extreme red coloration of the kbo .    the large kuiper belt object 2007 or10 provides an excellent test of our understanding of volatile loss and retention on the surfaces of objects in the outer solar system . while the size of 2007 or10 has yet to be measured , the simple assumption that it has an identical albedo to quaoar  the object whose spectrum its spectrum most resembles  places 2007 or10 into a regime where it would be expected to retain trace amounts of methane on its surface . such an object would be expected to have red optical coloration from methane irradiation , which both quaoar and 2007 or10 do have .",
    "in addition , such an object should have detectable signatures of methane if observed at sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "such methane signatures have been detected on quaoar , but require higher signal - to - noise to positively identify on 2007 or10 .",
    "while additional measurements of the size and spectrum of 2007 or10 are clearly required , we conclude that volatile retention models @xcite appear to continue to flawlessly predict both the presence and absence of volatiles on all objects in the kuiper belt which have been observed to date .                                        ,",
