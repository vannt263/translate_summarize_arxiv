    "in order to explain properties of hadrons , it is strongly hoped that qcd particle spectra can be calculated with a reasonable approximation .",
    "light - front field theory is one of the candidates to investigate qcd in the infrared region , since a certain nonperturbative approximation ( tamm - dancoff truncation ) becomes effective @xcite .",
    "since this method is based on a hamiltonian formalism , one can obtain mass spectra and wavefunctions of hadronic states which are important for the calculation of nonperturbative physical quantities such as structure functions @xcite .",
    "it has been said that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is responsible for the finite masses of mesons in the chiral limit .",
    "we need to know how the chiral condensate @xmath5 behaves in the chiral region to understand qcd mesons .",
    "however , one can not extract information of spontaneous symmetry breaking from the vacuum , since the light - front vacuum is always trivial .",
    "so the question is : how can we understand spontaneous symmetry breaking in the light - front field theory ?",
    "it is usual to apply the method of the effective potential to such a problem . in order to define the effective potential on the light - front ,",
    "let us consider a legendre transform ( which we call the effective energy ) of the ground state energy of the following hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath6=h-\\int d^{n-1}x j({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$}}})\\phi({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) ,     \\label{hj}\\ ] ] where the external field is independent of time and indicates the spatial coordinate .",
    "the advantage of this consideration is that it is possible to obtain the effective energy if we could know only the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "if the external field does not depend on the spatial coordinate , the effective potential is given as the effective energy divided by the total spatial volume of the system .",
    "then , it would be natural to define the system in a finite box @xmath7 and take the thermodynamic limit @xmath8 after all calculations .",
    "this is known as dlcq ( discretized light - cone quantization ) @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities for the consistent boundary condition on the field @xmath9 : periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "if we take a periodic boundary condition and assume a uniform external field @xmath10 , it would be possible in principle to obtain the effective potential from the effective energy . to do that",
    ", we have to know the light - front longitudinal zero mode @xcite , @xmath11 which appears in the second term of ( [ hj ] ) . if we impose a periodic boundary condition on the field , a constraint equation for the zero mode emerges .",
    "the light - front zero mode is a dependent variable and then should be represented with other oscillator modes .",
    "it has been numerically confirmed , with an approximation , that the zero mode gives rise to a non - zero vacuum expectation value and the entire effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking comes from only one mode @xcite .",
    "it seems that this scenario holds also in the calculation of the light - front effective potential .",
    "the zero mode should have a singular dependence on the external field @xmath12 to produce a correct convex shape for the effective potential in the broken phase .",
    "however , it does not work in practice solving the constraint and calculating the vacuum energy including the zero - mode effect , since the constraint equation is highly complicated and it is difficult to find some reasonable technique to solve it accurately .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss the problem without the zero mode .    the vacuum expectation value which minimizes the effective potential is a particular solution of the following quantum mechanical euler - lagrange equation @xmath13}{\\delta\\varphi(x)}=j(x ) ,     \\quad     j(x)\\to 0 ,     \\label{el0}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is an effective action .",

    "this will be done assuming an antiperiodic boundary condition and using a trick on the external field .",
    "since the translational invariance is broken by the external field , we can deal with the problem by avoiding the zero mode .",
    "the translational invariance of the system is restored by taking the @xmath2 limit after all the calculations .    in this paper , we look for an indication of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the two - dimensional @xmath0 model by paying attention to a functional form of the effective energy , where the system is defined and solved using dlcq @xcite , which is essentially a nonperturbative method and useful also as a conceptual tool @xcite .",
    "the effective energy is obtained as a functional of the classical field ( the expectation value of the field operator ) and a space - dependent non - uniform solution of the quantum mechanical euler - lagrange equation is found .    the essential point of this consideration is the imposition of an external field on the system . in order to describe the broken phase properly , we have to break the symmetry explicitly by imposing an external field on the system @xcite .",
    "the vanishing limit of the external field has to be taken after the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is impossible to figure out the properties of the effective energy if the order of the limits is changed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the second derivative of the effective potential is always positive and in particular the potential does not exist for small expectation values if spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs . if the symmetry breaks , the effective potential should have a flat bottom and the finite expectation value of the field survives in the @xmath2 limit .",
