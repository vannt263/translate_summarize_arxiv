    "the higgs discovery in 2012 by the atlas and cms experiments  @xcite and subsequent preliminary comparisons of its properties against the standard model ( sm ) expectation  @xcite have highlighted its sm character in standard measurements .",
    "the next step in demystifying the nature of the electroweak scale will therefore crucially rely on precise measurements of the higgs properties at low as well as high momentum transfers during run 2 , and on constraining or even measuring higgs properties that have not been in the sensitivity reach during run 1 .",
    "a parameter in the sm that is directly sensitive to spontaneous symmetry breaking is the quartic higgs coupling  @xmath3 @xmath4 where we use the unitary gauge @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the second independent parameter in the sm higgs potential @xmath7 is reverse  engineered to obtain an acceptably large value of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and pole mass @xmath8 for a given higgs self - coupling @xmath3 .",
    "these relations determine a unique value of the higgs self - coupling in the sm @xmath9 as required by renormalisablility .    to obtain a measurement of the higgs self - coupling @xmath3",
    ", we may think of eq .   as the lowest order in an effective field theory expansion in a new physics scale @xmath10 .",
    "a new operator possibly relevant for softening the correlation of higgs mass and electroweak scale is , e.g. , @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , in the absence of additional new resonant phenomena related to electroweak symmetry breaking and in order to prove or disprove the existence of such operators , a question that needs to be addressed is how well the higgs self - interaction parameter can be constrained assuming the standard low - energy higgs phenomenology only .",
    "our best option to phenomenologically access the relevant parameter @xmath3 at the lhc is via its impact on di - higgs production  @xcite via the trilinear higgs self - coupling .",
    "inclusive di - higgs cross sections typically have cross sections in the @xmath12(10  fb ) range  @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in order to analyse them , the large sm - like higgs branching ratios @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite must be employed .",
    "advanced substructure techniques  @xcite or small irreducible backgrounds such as in @xmath15  @xcite are crucial in most analyses to date , which have focused on the dominant di - higgs production cross section , gluon fusion ( gf ) with @xmath16 @xcite . to increase",
    "sensitivities in this channel emission of an additional jet has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; a complete analysis of wbf - like production in @xmath17 has become available only recently  @xcite .",
    "common to all realistic di - higgs analyses discussed in the literature is that they will be sensitive to systematic uncertainties at the end of run 2 and it is quite likely that measurements in only a single di - higgs channel will not provide enough information to formulate a significant constraint on the higgs self - interaction in the above sense  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is mandatory to extend the list of potential phenomenologically interesting search channels in proof - of - principle analyses .    in this paper",
    "we investigate @xmath1 , and study semi - leptonic and hadronic top decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in particular , we discuss the phenomenological appeal of this particular di - higgs final state as a function of the number of applied @xmath20-tags .",
    "we first study the qualitative behaviour of @xmath21 in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal ] , where we also comment on the signal and background event generation employed in the remainder of this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we detail our analysis and we discuss the sensitivity of @xmath1 to in detail before we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the sensitivity of di - higgs cross sections from gf and wbf is dominated by destructive interference of the continuum production and the subamplitude containing proportional to the trilinear coupling @xmath22 . in gluon fusion",
    "this is apparent from low - energy effective theory arguments  @xcite by expanding @xmath23 which makes the relative minus between the continuum and the @xmath24 diagrams explicit . as a consequence ,",
    "the gluon fusion cross section is a decreasing function with @xmath25 . in wbf",
    "the destructive character is explicit from nested cancellations that are similar to unitarity - based cancellations observed in longitudinal gauge boson scattering .    qualitatively different from gf- and",
    "wbf - induced di - higgs production , @xmath1 is the leading cross section which is impacted by _ constructive _ interference , yielding an increasing cross section with @xmath26 , fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] . quite different to loop - induced gluon fusion di - higgs production",
    ", there is no characteristic threshold scale involved in @xmath27 that can be exploited in a targeted boosted search strategy  @xcite ; the @xmath28 cross section is a rather flat function of @xmath22  @xcite and differential distributions away from production threshold do not show a significant deviation apart from a global rescaling of the differential distribution by @xmath29 for a transverse momentum range that is interesting for the experiments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the expected inclusive @xmath28 cross section with @xmath30 at a 14 tev lhc asks for a selection as inclusive as possible to be sensitive to the signal contribution even for a target luminosity of 3/ab in the first place .",
    "differential distributions at 14  tev centre of mass energy of the inclusive maximum higgs transverse momentum for different values of the higgs trilinear coupling @xmath22 .",
    "the lower panel displays the ratio of the @xmath31 distribution with respect to the sm ( @xmath32).,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    if we treat the top - yukawa interaction as legacy measurement and set @xmath33 , we can imagine a physics situation with an enhanced trilinear coupling that renders the dominant gluon fusion modes suppressed but leaves an excess in @xmath1 production . in the general dimension six extension alluded to in the introduction",
    "this corresponds to a negative wilson coefficient of @xmath34 .",
    "enhanced higgs self - couplings have been discussed more concretely in the context of conformal coleman - weinberg - type extensions of the sm in  @xcite . obviously , the opposite phenomenological situation of @xmath35 is accompanied by enhanced gf and wbf di - higgs cross sections while @xmath36 becomes smaller ( however the cross section becomes rather flat ) .",
    "such a situation occurs for instance in composite higgs scenarios  @xcite , which typically have a smaller higgs trilinear coupling than predicted in the sm ( in addition to modified top yukawa interactions ) .",
    "therefore , comparing the measured rates and ( ideally ) distributions in all three channels , i.e. gluon - fusion , weak - boson - fusion and in association with a top quark pair , provides a precision tool for bsm electroweak symmetry breaking .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     given the small production cross sections , we focus in the following on semi - leptonic decays of the final state top pair , with both higgs bosons decaying @xmath2 .",
    "we use sherpa v2.1.1 with the matrix element generator  @xcite to generate signal and background events for modified trilinear higgs couplings with sm - like top yukawa interactions and normalise to the signal events to the nlo cross section of ref .",
    "the signal and background samples have been generated at purely leading order matched to the parton shower , with modelling of hadronisation effects and underlying event .",
    "unstable particles are treated in the narrow width approximation with the subsequent decays conserving any spin correlations .",
    "the parton distribution functions used are from ct10  @xcite and the scales are set according to ref .",
    "the masses and widths of the sm particles used in the event generation are : @xmath37",
    "reconstructed invariant mass of bottom - quark pairs based on eq .   for @xmath38.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "while this high - multiplicity final state might allow to trigger in multiple ways , due to the low-@xmath39 thresholds for the jets we rely for this purpose on an isolated lepton ( muon or electron ) with @xmath40 gev . we define a lepton to be isolated if the hadronic energy deposit within a cone of size @xmath41 is smaller than @xmath42 of the lepton candidate s transverse momentum and @xmath43 .    after removing the isolated leptons from the list of input particles ( @xmath44 ) of the jet finder we reconstruct jets with @xmath45 and @xmath46 using the anti-@xmath47 algorithm  @xcite of  @xcite .",
    "we veto events with less than 6 reconstructed jets .    out of the 6 jets we require at least 5 to be @xmath20-tagged by matching the @xmath20-meson before the decay to the jet .",
    "we assume a @xmath20-tagging efficiency of @xmath48 and a fake rate of  @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "as the signal rate after these inclusive cuts is already fairly small , @xmath50 fb for @xmath51 , we select the higgs - decay jets by minimising @xmath52 where @xmath53 run over all @xmath20-tagged jets and @xmath54 gev ( we comment on this choice further below ) and @xmath55 gev . for the combination which minimises @xmath56 we require @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we then remove these 4 @xmath20-tagged jets from the event .    to confidently reduce the large gauge boson induced backgrounds , e.g. @xmath59+jets , we further require at least one top quark to be reconstructed .",
    "we provide cross sections after the reconstruction of the leptonic top only , after reconstructing the hadronic top quark only or after reconstructing either the leptonic or the hadronic top quark .    to avoid biasing the vector boson backgrounds towards the top quark signal , for the leptonic top quark reconstruction we require that the invariant mass of the sum of the lepton , a @xmath20-jet and the missing transverse energy vector , built from all visible objects within @xmath44 , fulfil @xmath60 with @xmath61 gev and @xmath62  gev .",
    "to identify the @xmath20-jet for @xmath63 we consider all remaining @xmath20-jets in the event and minimise @xmath64 similarly , for the hadronic top quark reconstruction we loop over all remaining jets and minimise @xmath65 we then request @xmath66    the cut flow for the described analysis steps is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : cutflow ] .",
    "expected confidence levels for the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : rec ] as a function of the trilinear higgs coupling @xmath22.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath67 tev , the signal cross section for @xmath68 is in the sub - femtobarn range before decays are included .",
    "therefore , the reconstruction requires an approach that on the one hand retains an as large as possible signal yield and on the other hand triggers in the high - luminosity regime .",
    "we therefore focus on the higgs decays to bottom quarks and semi - leptonic @xmath69 decays .",
    "other channels can be combined with the one we focus on to improve the sensitivity on measuring the self - coupling .    already after fulfilling the trigger requirement , minimal jet cuts and 5 @xmath20 tags",
    "we find @xmath70 for the backgrounds we consider . to confirm the measurement of a di - higgs event both higgs bosons have to be fully reconstructed .",
    "at this stage we find @xmath71 with 5 @xmath20 tags and @xmath72 with 6 @xmath20 tags respectively .",
    "we show the reconstructed masses of the hardest and second hardest higgs boson in fig .",
    "[ fig : rechiggs ] . due to the partly invisible decay of b - mesons , @xmath73",
    "is systematically shifted to slightly lower values .",
    "this is why we choose @xmath74 gev for the minimisation procedure . in measurements",
    ", the experiments can compensate for this systematic shift in the invariant higgs mass using @xmath20-jet calibrations .",
    "further , at this point with the chosen b - tagging - efficiency working point @xmath59+jets backgrounds are already subleading .",
    "thus , choosing a higher @xmath20-tagging efficiency working point at cost of a larger fake rate could be beneficial in this analysis to retain a larger signal yield and improve the statistical significance expressed in @xmath75 .    in a further step",
    "we then perform a leptonic or hadronic top quark reconstruction using the remaining measured final state objects . this can help to further suppress potentially large reducible qcd - induced backgrounds , e.g. @xmath59+jets .",
    "however , for the top - rich irreducible backgrounds we focus here mostly on , an improvement in @xmath76 can not be achieved using the signal - sparing @xmath56 minimisation we apply .    from tab .",
    "[ tab : cutflow ] it becomes obvious that the signal vs. background ratio is expected to be in the @xmath42 range for @xmath77 .",
    "after 3/ab we expect 13 signal events including the reconstruction of a top quark and 22 signal events reconstructing only the two higgs bosons . while the signal yield is too small to claim",
    "a discovery at this stage the number of observed events is high enough to formulate an expected 95% confidence level limit on @xmath22 assuming @xmath33 . in order to do this ,",
    "we employ the cls method  @xcite inputting the expected number of signal and background events for a luminosity of 3/ab including the reconstruction of at least one top quark . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] ; and we obtain @xmath78    together with analyses of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 channels that yield a confidence interval @xmath81 @xcite , depending on systematic uncertainties , @xmath28 will allow us to extend the sensitivity range and in fact to almost entirely cover the parameter @xmath22 at the end of lhc run 2 .",
    "with current higgs property measurements strongly indicating a sm - like character of the discovered higgs boson , analysis strategies for parameters relevant for electroweak symmetry breaking that remain unconstrained in standard higgs searches will play a central role in the search for new physics beyond the sm during run 2 . constraining the higgs self - interaction as one of the most interesting couplings in this regard",
    "is a experimentally challenging task and will require a large accumulated data set .",
    "as we have discussed in this letter , the role of @xmath1 production in this regard is twofold : firstly , it provides an additional channel that can be added to a global higgs self - coupling analysis across the phenomenologically viable channels .",
    "signal vs. background ratios indicate that top - pair associated higgs pair production can provide significant statistical power to increase the sensitivity to this crucial coupling at a targeted 3/ab and extend the sensitivity coverage to the higgs trilinear coupling .",
    "secondly , if we face a situation with @xmath82 , @xmath83 provides the _ leading _ channel , where we can expect to observe an excess over the sm expectation .",
    "a negative search outcome in gf and wbf dominated search strategies in addition to an excess in @xmath28 final states would therefore be a strong indication of @xmath84 , eventually allowing us to put strong constraints on bsm scenarios such as composite higgs models .",
