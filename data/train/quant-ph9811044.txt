    "the interactions in solids can be controlled with complex radio - frequency ( rf ) pulse sequences ( such as decoupling pulse sequences ) . in general , the interactions in solids are so strong that the eigenstates are not the simple spin product states and logical manipulation are more complex @xcite . however , for special solids ( such as @xmath0 and @xmath9 , and @xmath8 and @xmath10 mixtures ) , since the homonuclear spin system is diluted by other spin system , the spin dipolar interactions between two homonuclei are weak and the solid mixtures may be homogeneous so that the solids could have a resolved dipolar structure .",

    ", the principal limitation of solid state nmr is its relatively low sensitivity . in addition",
    ", another limitation of solid state nmr is its lack of spatial selectivity and extremely broad nmr lines .",
    "this is because the nmr signals from an inhomogeneous sample are bulk - averaged @xcite and the dipole - dipole interactions between two spins are strong .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assign particular logic gates to regions within the bulk sample . constructing the actual quantum circuit based on nmr could be an important issue .",
    "now , the actual quantum circuit based on liquid state nmr is constructed only _ in time _ by using different pulse sequences .",

    "we propose a scheme for the implementation of quantum logic gates by using opnmr in solids , where the electron spin @xmath44 and the nuclear spin @xmath45 are respectively considered as the `` control''qubit and the `` target''qubit .    for semiconductors with zinc blende structures ( such as , si and gaas _ etc .",
    ") , _ spin polarization of conduction electrons in semiconductors can be produced by near - infrared laser light with circularly polarized light working at the band gap @xcite . since electron and nuclear spins",
    "are coupled by the hyperfine interaction , polarization is transferred between electrons and nuclei by the spin flip - flop transitions . through many optical pumping cycles ,",
    "large polarization of nuclear spins can be achieved at low temperature .",
    "when the large nuclear spin polarizations are produced , one can directly detect nmr signals from hyperpolarized nuclei in the semiconductors with conventional nmr techniques or optical techniques .",
    "in addition , since optical detection of nmr is extremely sensitive , which can detect nmr signals from fewer than @xmath46 @xcite nuclei , the optical methods are naturally preferable to the conventional nmr methods .",
    "optical detection is mainly based on the following two mechanisms . in direct - gap semiconductors ,",
    "a conduction electron can emit a circularly polarized photon through recombining with a hole in the hole band .",
    "the degree of circular polarization of the photoluminescence depends on the polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "the hyperfine interaction leads to spin polarization transfer between electrons and nuclei .",
    "therefore it is possible to detect nmr in direct - gap semiconductors indirectly by optical detection methods @xcite .",
    "in addition , under nmr conditions , hyperpolarized nuclei in semiconductors can act back on electron spins by the hyperfine interaction so that they shift electron zeeman levels ( overhauser shift ) @xcite and change polarization of electron spins .",
    "this is because hyperpolarized nuclei exert a magnetic field ( called the nuclear hyperfine field ) on the electron spins @xcite .",
    "the nuclear hyperfine field is directly proportional to the nuclear spin polarization .",
    "radio - frequency pulse near an nmr transition can change the strength and direction of this field .",
    "the net magnetic field felt by the electron spins depends on the combined action of this field and the externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the shift of the conduction electron zeeman levels results from the change of the net magnetic field .",
    "it is possible to measure this overhauser shift @xcite and the polarization of the photoluminescence through sensitive optical spectroscopies with tunable lasers and highly sensitive detectors under nmr conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore one indirectly measures nmr in the direct - gap semiconductors by optical detection methods .    in the following",
    ", we shall discuss how to prepare and measure the states of the nuclear spins in the direct - gap semiconductors and how to perform the controlled rotation operation on the nuclear spins in our scheme .    for simplicity",
    ", we shall take the direct - gap semiconductor inp into account , which has electronic levels similar to gaas ( see fig .",
    "2a ) @xcite . near the @xmath47 point",
    "( electronic bloch wavevector k is equal to zero ) , an excess of conduction electrons with @xmath48 can be produced by using circularly polarized light with helicity @xmath40 tuned to the band gap ( e@xmath49 in inp near 0 k ) @xcite .",
    "the direction of the conduction electron spin polarization can be controlled by circularly polarized light with different helicities ( such as @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) .",
    "electron spin polarization can be transferred to the @xmath50 nucleus by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath50 nuclear resonance frequency change is directly proportional to the electron spin polarization @xmath51 @xcite , i.e. @xmath52 @xcite , where a is a coupling constant , @xmath53 is the conduction electron density envelop function , @xmath54 is the displacement of nucleus from a conduction electron and @xmath51 is electron spin polarization .",
    "the nuclear resonance frequency of @xmath50 can be written as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath57 is the externally applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore one can use the observed nmr frequency shift based on positive or negative electron spin polarization @xmath51 to control @xmath50 nuclear rotations by using selective r.f . pulses .",
    "for example , only when the electron spin polarization is positive , a radio pulse required to flip spin can be used to selectively change the states of the nucleus . when the electron spin polarization is negative",
    ", one has no use for doing anything .",
    "therefore , one can perform the controlled rotation operations of @xmath50 nuclear spin on the basis of different directions of electron spin polarizations .",
    "the purpose of optical pumping in the computer is to control the hyperfine interaction between electrons and nuclei , indirectly to mediate nuclear spin interactions , to produce electron and nuclear spin polarization and indirectly to measure nuclear spin polarization .",
    "for example , when the valence band electrons are excited to the conduction band near the @xmath47 point , the large hyperfine interaction energy is yielded .",
    "this is because near the @xmath47 point , the conduction band is primarily composed of wavefunctions with @xmath58 orbits so that the electron wavefunctions are concentrated at the nucleus . when one uses a laser to pump a cell between two cells in the semiconductors ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , it can enhance nuclear dipole - dipole interactions and mediate the indirect nuclear spin coupling .",
    "this is because when the electrons are excited to the conduction band by a laser , the conduction electron wavefunction extends over large distance through the crystal lattice and large electron spin polarizations are produced .",
    "electron spin polarization can be transferred to nuclear spins by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "as soon as larger nuclear spin polarizations are produced , the nuclear spins act back on the electron and shift the electron zeeman energy ( overhauser shift ) @xcite . by measuring the magnitude of the overhauser shift under nmr conditions ,",
    "it is possible to measure the states of nuclei with the raman spectroscopy @xcite .    on the basis of the above discussions , in the following",
    ", we shall discuss how to prepare the cell magnetization in an initial state , how to perform the controlled rotation operations of @xmath50 nuclear spin , how to couple the effective pure states of the two adjacent cells and how to measure the effective states of logic gates at different cells .",
    "optical pumping in the computer can be used to prepare the electron spin states and the nuclear spin states , i.e. control qubits and target qubits .",
    "as we have seen , one can pump the electrons in valence band into positive or negative polarizations of conduction electrons by using circularly light with different helicities ( @xmath40 or @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore an initial state in a cell can be loaded with circularly polarized light with different helicities ( @xmath59 or @xmath40 ) .",
    "for example , in order to prepare electron and nuclear spins up ( at a magnetic field ) , spin up of the conduction electrons can be produced with circularly polarized light with helicity of @xmath40 tuned to the band gap , and spin up of @xmath60 nuclei can also be prepared by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "similarly , one can prepare electron and nuclear spins down with circularly polarized light with helicity of @xmath59 . in fig.2b , one uses many laser beams with different helicities ( @xmath59 or @xmath40 ) to initial logic gates at different cells in the different states .",
    "the controlled rotation operations of @xmath50 nuclear spins can be performed by r.f pulses with different frequencies on the basis of the states ( spins up or down ) of the conduction electrons at different cells , as has been discussed above .    in fig.2b",
    ", entanglements of effective pure states between cell 1 and cell 3 , might be performed by the following means . between two logic gates",
    "( such as 1 and 3 in fig.2b ) , if one uses laser with higher power to pump cell 2 , one can produce much more conduction electrons near cell 2 and obtain higher polarization of the conduction electrons at cell 2 , laser pumping at cell 2 results in the electron wavefunction at the cell extending over large distances through the crystal lattice .",
    "the electron spin dipole - dipole interactions between these two gates ( 1 and 3 ) are increased through the conduction electrons of the 2 cell mediating electron spin dipole - dipole interactions between cell 2 and cell 1 , and cell 2 and cell 3 .",
    "therefore one can use pumping laser light indirectly to mediate an indirect coupling between @xmath50 qubits of two cells by means of the @xmath50 electron - nuclear hyperfine interaction .",
    "if one uses pumping laser with low or no power to pump cell 2 , one can decrease the indirect interactions between @xmath50 qubits of two cells so that two gates 1 and 3 can independently work .",
    "as the distance between two cells is increased , the interactions between distant logic spin will no longer be effective , fortunately , universal quantum computation is still possible with just local interactions @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is because one can use a cellular automata architecture to perform any function computations in a linearly - increasing computational time with system size due to massage passing @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 nuclear spin states at a cell can indirectly be measured with the raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this is because when @xmath50 nuclear spin is up or down , the magnitude of the overhauser shift under nmr conditions is different @xcite .",
