    "while most working physicists pay homage to the copenhagen interpretation of the heisenberg - schrdinger quantum mechanics ( qm ) , many others seek a more causal re - interpretation .",
    "one ambitious effort in this direction has its origin in the works of david bohm  @xcite .",
    "bohm employed a formalism for computing the paths for quantum mechanical particles closely analogous to the method of hamilton and jacobi .",
    "nevertheless the bohm approach  @xcite , also known as stochastic quantum mechanics ( sqm ) , has been thought to reproduce _ in all instances _ the same probability distributions as does qm .",
    "the research concerning sqm involves a considerable number of authors dealing with various aspects , even if not always within the terms as originally proposed by bohm  @xcite .",
    "studies of extension of the bohm approach to the relativistic case are also available  @xcite . notwithstanding the relatively difficult nature of sqm computations",
    ", it is a generally accepted belief that , where a comparison is possible , sqm and qm would give the same results .",
    "this is indeed the case for the average values of observables at a fixed time .    however , in a previous work  @xcite",
    ", examples were reported in which sqm produces results different from qm .",
    "the examples involved the two - time correlation functions of the electric dipole moment components in the hydrogen atom . within sqm",
    ", an explicit numerical calculation was performed  @xcite yielding the related spectral function ( fourier transform of the two - time correlation function ) for the hydrogen atom in the excited state @xmath0 .",
    "it was found to be quite different from the corresponding quantity in qm .",
    "our purpose is to study in more detail the comparison between the frequency spectral functions in the two theories .",
    "the general definition of two time correlation functions ( for a generic system described by a _ time independent _ hamiltonian @xmath1 ) is @xmath2 the related noise spectral functions are defined as the fourier transform @xmath3 _",
    "sum rules _ for the functions @xmath4 are investigated in terms of their @xmath5-order moments @xmath6 , @xmath7    taking up ( for definiteness ) the case of the electric dipole moment @xmath8 of the hydrogen atom , the following issues are addressed : ( i ) an explicit analytic form is derived ( in terms of modified bessel functions ) within sqm for the noise spectral function of the dipole moments for the first few excited states , explicitly @xmath9 .",
    "general formulas are given for special combinations of quantum numbers , e.g. @xmath10 .",
    "( ii ) a general proof is given concerning the asymptotic behavior of the spectral functions of the dipole moment fluctuations .",
    "as @xmath11 , the spectral functions vanish with a power law for both qm and sqm , but with _ different _ exponents .",
    "( iii ) the moments of the spectral functions are investigated both for qm and sqm , showing explicitly the second order moment differences .    in sec .",
    "ii a brief review of the stochastic quantum mechanics is provided and in sec .",
    "iii the general notion of the two - time correlation function is defined .",
    "the related spectral function is also introduced . in sec .",
    "iv , an explicit calculation is reported for the hydrogen atom two - time correlation function of the electric dipole moment .",
    "the spectral function asymptotic behavior for large frequency is discussed .",
    "v contains a discussion of moment sum rules , and in the concluding sec .  vi the differences between qm and sqm are further explored .",
    "in sqm the wave function @xmath12 entering into the schrdinger equation , @xmath13 is conveniently written in the form @xmath14 . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real functions .",
    "sqm then provides a causal interpretation for the two resulting coupled differential equations thus obtained ; i.e.    @xmath17    [ eqmulti ]    the first of the above two equations is of the hamilton - jacobi form .",
    "this is generalized by the presence of a new term which takes into account the quantum effects via the _ quantum potential _",
    "contribution @xmath18 @xmath19 is the sqm version of the hamilton principal function .",
    "the equations of motion are computed from @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the velocity of the particle that passes through the point @xmath23 at time @xmath24 .",

    "one introduces quantities which account for the particle properties of an ensemble of identical systems ( same hamiltonian , same quantum state , etc . ) with trajectories .",
    "if the initial distribution in configuration space @xmath25 is assumed to be given by @xmath26 then the distribution @xmath27 satisfies the continuity equation provided that @xmath28 _ at all times_. this expresses the time invariance of the configuration - space measure  @xmath29 \" .",
    "the probability distribution in configuration space given by @xmath30 is called the _ quantum equilibrium _ distribution . a system is then said to be in quantum equilibrium when its configurations are randomly distributed according to the quantum equilibrium distribution  @xcite .",

    "in sqm , the probability density at time @xmath36 is related to particle trajectories . closely analogous to classical statistical mechanics ,",
    "starting from the initial distribution @xmath37 , one has : @xmath38 \\rho(\\bm{r}_0,0)=|\\psi(\\bm{r},t)|^2.\\ ] ]    averaging the initial position @xmath39 then yields the same average values of the corresponding operators in quantum mechanics .",

    "given any two dynamic variables , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the average value of their product , weighed over the initial condition by the weight function @xmath53 , is just the sqm two - time correlation function@xcite ; it is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and similarly @xmath56 .      to simplify the notation ,",
