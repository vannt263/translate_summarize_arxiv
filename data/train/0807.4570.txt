    "trojan companions are bodies in a 1:1 mean - motion resonance with a planet , librating around one of the two lagrange points ( l4 and l5 ) of the planet s orbit around the star .",
    "several methods have been proposed to detect trojan companions to exoplanets ( laughlin & chambers 2002 , croll et al .",
    "2007 , ford & holman 2007 , ford & gaudi 2006 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present a search for trojan companions to 25 known transiting exoplanets for which suitable data are available , using the method of ford & gaudi ( 2006 , hereafter , `` fg '' ) . an important virtue of this method is that a sensitive search for trojans can be performed using only the rv and photometric data that are routinely obtained while confirming transit candidates and characterizing the planets .",
    "the basic idea of the fg method is to compare the photometrically observed transit time ( @xmath2 ) with the expected transit time ( @xmath3 ) that is calculated by fitting a two - body keplerian orbit to the rv data , i.e. assuming no trojan .",
    "the presence of a trojan companion as a third body would cause a timing offset @xmath4 .    in the case of a circular orbit , if there is no trojan companion , the force vector on the star points directly at the planet and the observed transit time @xmath2 coincides with the time @xmath5 when the orbital velocity of the star is in the plane of the sky ( i.e. , the time of rv null ) .",
    "if instead there is a single trojan located at the l4 or l5 lagrange point ( or librating with a small amplitude ) , then the force vector on the star does not point directly at the planet ; it is displaced in angle toward the trojan companion . as a result , @xmath2 occurs earlier or later than @xmath5 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath6 is proportional to the trojan mass @xmath7 , for small values of the trojan - to - planet mass ratio ( ford & gaudi 2006 ) : @xmath8 .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to a mass excess at the l4 point ( leading the planet ) while the negative sign corresponds to that at the l5 point ( lagging the planet ) . for an eccentric two - body orbit , @xmath3 does not generally coincide with @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 by fitting a two - body keplerian orbit to the rv data and calculating the expected transit time based on the fitted orbital parameters .",
    "the rv data were taken from the available literature on each system .",
    "we fitted the keplerian model to the rv data using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique , employing a metropolis - hastings algorithm ( see , e.g. , ford  2005 ) . in general ,",
    "uniform priors were used for all parameters .",
    "a prior constraint on @xmath9 was used where secondary eclipse measurements are available in literature .",
    "a single chain of @xmath10 links was used for each system . for each parameter",
    ", we found the mode of the _ a posteriori _ distribution , and the 68.3% confidence interval , defined as the range that excludes 15.9% of the probability at each extreme of the distribution .",
    "we thus obtained @xmath3 from fitting the rv data .",
    "we determined @xmath2 using the most precise published photometric ephemeris , and then computed @xmath4 .",
    "the results for @xmath11 are translated into constraints on the trojan mass @xmath7 using eq .",
    "( 1 ) for circular orbits , and using equivalent expressions for eccentric orbits obtained by numerical integrations of three - body orbits .",
    "the 95.4% ( 2@xmath0 ) upper limits on @xmath7 and on @xmath12 are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the median upper limit on @xmath7 is 60  @xmath1 , with the most constraining limit of 2.5  @xmath1 holding for gj  436 .",
    "this powerful upper limit is possible for this case because of the small stellar and planetary masses , and the copious rv data available for this system .",
    "the median upper limit on the mass ratio @xmath12 is 0.1 , with a best - case value of 0.015 for hd  17156 .",
    "the powerful constraint in this case is a result of the unusually long orbital period of 21  days and plentiful precise rv data .        in all cases but two ,",
    "the result for @xmath11 was consistent with zero within 2@xmath0 .",
    "the exceptions were corot - exo-2 and wasp-2 , for which @xmath13 and @xmath14  minutes respectively .",
    "the results for these two systems are worth following up with additional rv data . however , in a sample of 25 systems , even if @xmath11 is always consistent with zero , one expects approximately one 2@xmath0 outlier . there were no cases in which @xmath11 was inconsistent with zero at the 3@xmath0 level .",
    "hence , we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a trojan companion in this ensemble .",
