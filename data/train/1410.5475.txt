    "defects are ubiquitous in systems with symmetry breaking phase transitions . independent domains form wherever the system can choose between two or more degenerate ground states , and defects appear at the borders between such domains .",
    "this is also the case of the order parameter of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , whose phase can assume arbitrary values .",
    "phase defects of a bec are , for instance , solitons and vortex lines , which can also be created by phase imprinting @xcite or density engineering @xcite . in a temperature quench across the bec phase transition",
    "they appear as a result of the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) .",
    "in fact , if the quench is fast enough , the growing condensate has no time to share a unique phase everywhere and defects are spontaneously generated .",
    "kzm provides a relation between the density of defects and the quench rate .",
    "it was initially developed for cosmological models , but later generalized for condensed matter systems  @xcite . in a recent experiment in trento  @xcite",
    ", such defect production was observed in an ultra - cold gas of sodium atoms , and the kz power - law scaling was also measured .",
    "the nature of the observed defects was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "similar defects were also observed after phase imprinting in a fermionic lithium gas  @xcite . related theoretical studies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the type of defects in a bec strongly depends on the geometry of the trapping potential and , more precisely , on its dimensionality . in an axially symmetric elongated harmonic trap ,",
    "the relevant dimensionless parameter is the ratio between the chemical potential and the transverse harmonic oscillator energy , @xmath0 , which also fixes the ratio between the transverse size of the condensate and the healing length , @xmath1 . if @xmath2 , the system is in a quasi-1d regime , where the natural stable defects are solitons @xcite . for @xmath3 solitons are subject to the so - called snake instability and decay into more complex structures with smaller energy @xcite .    in an elongated bec , the most robust structure",
    "is represented by the _ solitonic vortex _ ( sv ) , which displays features of both a vortex and a soliton as a result of the asymmetric confinement in the directions perpendicular to the vortex line @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1:sim_trap]a ) .",
    "the structure of a sv can be qualitatively understood by considering the difference between a vortex line aligned along the axis of axisymmetric bec and a vortex line in the perpendicular direction . in the former case",
    "the density and the velocity fields are both isotropic and the phase of the order parameter varies linearly as a function of the angle around the axis . in the latter case , instead , density and phase are no longer isotropic around the vortex and the equi - phase surfaces bend and squeeze in a region close to the plane containing the vortex line ( see fig . [",
    "fig1:sim_trap]a ) . in this region the phase gradient , and hence the superfluid velocity ,",
    "is stronger and the system reduces its energy by depleting the density .",
    "seen from the regions away from the defect plane , the sv behaves as a solitonic excitation of the bec , with a local density structure and an overall phase jump . in an elongated bec ,",
    "a large phase gradient and a significant density depletion occur when @xmath4 is small , while in the limit @xmath3 a sv reduces to the usual quantized vortex in a bulk condensate ( fig .",
    "[ fig1:sim_trap]b ) .",
    "in this work we aim to better characterize the properties of a sv and show how a sv can be experimentally observed .",
    "our experimental system is based on sodium atoms trapped in a cigar - shaped harmonic trap with frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "rf - forced evaporation is performed to cool the atomic sample across the critical temperature with controlled cooling rates .",
    "depending on the cooling rate a certain number of defects is created in the bec , in agreement with the kzm , as was reported in  @xcite . since our aim here is to study the nature of a single defect , we choose a quenching ramp of @xmath8  khz / s , which produces about one defect on average . with 20 - 25 million atoms the transition temperature is @xmath9 nk ( for further experimental details",
    "see  @xcite ) . in the experiment",
    "we attain the regime where @xmath10 .",
    "once a condensate is produced and cooled well below @xmath11 , we release the trapping confinement and allow the gas to expand for a long time - of - flight ( 120 ms ) in a levitating magnetic field gradient .",
    "we are interested in simulating the dynamics of the expansion of a condensate containing a sv . for this",
    "we use the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , @xmath12 for the condensate wave function at zero temperature , @xmath13 , normalized to the particle number : @xmath14 . the confining potential is weaker along @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath16 is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "we start with 2d simulations , which are easier to perform and give some insight into the behaviour of the sv .",
    "the condensate is in the @xmath15-@xmath19 plane with @xmath20 and the long axis along @xmath15 .",
    "the stationary configuration of the bec containing a defect is obtained via an imaginary time evolution of the 2d gpe with a suitable phase profile , which is the isotropic phase distribution of a single quantized vortex at @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig1:sim_trap]a shows the in - trap phase and density profiles after convergence for three values of @xmath4 .",
    "small density depletion in the direction perpendicular to the sv for @xmath22 becomes large for @xmath23 and leads to a dark soliton for @xmath24 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1:sim_trap]b shows the ratio between densities in different points , @xmath25(0,@xmath26 ) and @xmath27(@xmath28,0 ) , for a bec with a sv as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath29 and for three values of chemical potential @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the thomas - fermi radii in the transverse and axial directions respectively . in a spherical trap ( @xmath33 )",
    ", the sv becomes a standard vortex whose density depletion is confined in the vortex core of size @xmath34 , and for symmetry @xmath35 . for an elongated bec ( @xmath36 ) the defect crosses over to the sv regime where @xmath37 .",
    "finally , for very elongated traps , the bec enters the 1d regime , and the defect becomes a dark soliton ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the same figure shows that , by plotting the results as a function of @xmath4 , all points collapse onto a single curve , thus confirming that the nature of a defect depends on @xmath4 , in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "this analysis quantitatively shows the existence of three regimes , a _",
    "1d regime _ admitting solitons , a _ bulk regime _ , with standard vortices , and a _ crossover regime _ that hosts svs .",
    "similar results are obtained with full 3d simulations , and the 3d data is only slightly shifted with respect to the 2d points .",
    "we compare the expansion of 2d condensates containing either a soliton or a sv . in case of a dark soliton",
    "the starting phase profile is a uniform phase with a jump @xmath39 across the solitonic line at @xmath40 .",
    "after convergence , the soliton exhibits a density depletion of width @xmath41 at the nodal line .",
    "free expansion is simulated by using the trapped stationary solution as initial state in the real time integration of the gpe , in which @xmath42 and @xmath43 are set to zero . during the expansion , density and mean - field interaction decrease and the healing length ( and thus the size of the density depletion of any defect ) grows in time . for a soliton",
    "this implies that the expanded soliton is wider and can be observed after a long enough time - of - flight .",
    "the sv has a more complex phase pattern which , in addition to the widening of the defect , produces two peculiar effects : i ) the density depletion in the transverse direction deepens and ii ) the line , along which the density is depleted , twists around the central vortex .",
    "this twist comes from the superposition of the velocity fields of the vortex and the velocity of the expansion ( or equivalently , the interference of the corresponding phase patterns ) .",
    "this effect lasts as long as the mean - field interaction plays a role .",
    "when the expansion becomes ballistic , the twist stops .",
    "the combination of i ) and ii ) makes the sv much more visible after the expansion than in trap .",
    "typical results of simulations in 2d are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:sim_exp]a . during expansion the visibility of the density depleted plane of the sv",
    "is strongly enhanced .",
    "we perform 3d simulations for comparison with experimental images . in order to reduce the computational time , we limit simulations to @xmath44 and we dynamically rescale all lengths in the transverse direction according to the thomas - fermi scaling law for the expanding order parameter  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig2:sim_exp]b shows @xmath45 as a function of time . in this case",
    "@xmath25 is the density at @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the position of the local density minimum .",
    "the result is consistent with experimental data for which a large @xmath48 would correspond to a negligible depletion in trap but clearly visible after expansion ( fig .",
    "[ fig3:exp_density ] ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of simulation in 2d and 3d shows that the twist is less pronounced in 3d , which is consistent with the fact that in 3d the condensate density decreases faster than in 2d and than the expansion becomes ballistic earlier .",
    "experimentally we investigate the density profile and the phase properties of the bec after a time - of - flight of 120 ms ( @xmath49 axial oscillation periods ) . at such time",
    "the bec has a pancake distribution .",
    "a vertical magnetic field gradient is applied after the trapping potential removal to levitate the bec .",
    "* measurement of the density profile : triaxial absorption imaging * + we simultaneously image the density profile of our bec from three orthogonal directions , the axial and two radial ones .",
    "the transverse size of the defects is of the order of the local healing length at any given time . after a long expansion time the defects are clearly visible from the radial direction . in the axial direction , on the other hand , the visibility is lower due to the integration of density along the whole bec . in order to extract anyway useful information",
    "we then subtract the thomas - fermi profile fit from the data and plot the residuals ( see fig . [ fig3:exp_density ] ) .    from the axial direction",
    "we clearly see lines crossing the bec , straight or curved , but always ending almost perpendicularly to the bec outer surface . from the radial directions we either see straight lines or lines with a twist and a hollow core at the center . combining these images",
    "we deduce the nature of the observed defect , a sv .    * measurement of the phase profile : bragg interferometry * + the triaxial density detection is quite rich of information and clearly leads us to identification our defects as sv .",
    "nevertheless we implemented a homodyne bragg interferometer in order to prove the 2@xmath50 phase winding around the expected vortex core .    during time of flight",
    "we apply a sequence of two @xmath51 pulses .",
    "the first one splits the original bec into two equal copies , one at rest and one moving with the bragg momentum .",
    "the second pulse does the same on both copies and two pairs of shifted bec copies are created .",
    "the pair at rest , as well as the pair that are moving , interfere with each other in the overlapping region and fringes can be detected . if the bec phase was initially uniform then the fringe pattern results sinusoidal . in case of a vortex , instead , we see a pair of dislocation - antidislocation in the resulting phase pattern , as expected from simulation .",
    "[ fig4:exp_bragg ] shows the comparison between our experimental data and simulations .",
    "this proves that our defects do have circulation .",
    "furthermore this confirms that the twist orientation is directly linked to the vortex sign @xcite .",
    "@xcite , the combination of two radial images of an expanding condensate led to the identification of defects as solitons . a subsequent additional axial imaging and the interferometric phase measurement clearly",
    "demonstrate that the defects we observe are svs .",
    "our simulations show the crossover from a 1d regime , supporting solitons , to a 3d regime , supporting vortices . in the intermediate regime",
    "the planar density depletion and large phase gradient are clearly visible as signatures of svs .",
    "although in the experiment we are at the edge of the crossover region , with a small planar density depletion , we are still able to obtain striking evidences of the sv presence thanks to the amplification of the depletion contrast in expansion .",
    "since the defects are observed long after they are formed via the kibble - zurek mechanism occurring at the bec transition and since we have no experimental access to the early dynamics of formation , it remains unknown whether the sv we see are decay products from initially formed solitons or if they form directly via kzm . with the parameters of our elongated condensates ,",
    "the sv is expected soon to become the defect with the lowest energy @xcite as the chemical potential increases during the cooling process .",
    "further investigations are planned to clarify this issue , for instance by developing an appropriate imaging technique to observe the evolution of phase imprinted defects .",
