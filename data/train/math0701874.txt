    "the moduli space @xmath0 of spin curves of genus @xmath1 has been introduced in @xcite in order to compactify the moduli space of pairs @xmath2    the interest in this space has been increasing in the last few years due to a wide spectrum of applications , which range from mathematical physics to arithmetic geometry passing through algebraic geometry and combinatorics ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , very little is known about the topological properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the first results in this direction can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in these pioneering articles ,",
    "the stability of the homology groups and some low degree cohomology groups of @xmath3 are investigated .    in the present paper ,",
    "we compute the virtual cohomological dimension of @xmath3 ( see lemma  [ virtual ] ) .",
    "next , we focus on the compactification @xmath0 , especially on the first relevant case @xmath4 . in particular , we determine the hodge diamond of @xmath5 ( see proposition [ hodge ] ) and describe the cohomology ring of @xmath5 via generators and relations ( see theorem [ coho2n ] and theorem [ coho3n ] ) .    at first sight",
    ", it might seem that the topology of the moduli space of spin curves is not really different from that of the moduli space of stable curves .",
    "in fact , the constructions of these two spaces do not differ in a substantial way . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 turns out to have a richer geometric structure , which requires a more careful analysis .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is the union of two connected components , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which correspond to even and odd spin curves , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath4 , we separately investigate the cohomology of each component and discover two non - isomorphic ring structures .    in order to accomplish this task ,",
    "we combine an inductive approach inspired by @xcite with direct calculations in the style of @xcite .",
    "this leads us to introduce suitable moduli spaces of pointed spin curves and to address several related problems .",
    "in particular , we obtain an explicit affine stratification of @xmath5 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "thanks are due to maurizio cornalba for helpful conversations on the subject of this research and to katharina ludwig for pointing out a mistake in a previous version of the present paper .",
    "the authors are deeply grateful to the referee for careful reading of the manuscript and patient advice on how to improve it ( see for instance remark  [ referee ] ) .    throughout",
    "we work over the field @xmath8 of complex numbers .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic definitions about spin structures . here we follow closely @xcite , to which we refer for more details . for a more general approach",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a deligne - mumford semistable curve and let @xmath10 be a complete , irreducible subcurve of @xmath9 .",
    "the curve @xmath10 is said to be _ exceptional _ when it is smooth , rational , and intersects the other components in exactly two points .",

    "therefore , @xmath18 vanishes identically on all exceptional components of @xmath9 and induces an isomorphism @xmath19 in particular , when @xmath9 is smooth , @xmath14 is just a theta - characteristic on @xmath9 .",
    "two spin curves @xmath20 and @xmath21 are _ isomorphic _ if there are isomorphisms @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is compatible with the natural isomorphism between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    a _ family of spin curves _ is a flat family of quasi - stable curves @xmath27 with an invertible sheaf @xmath28 on @xmath29 and a homomorphism @xmath30 such that the restriction of these data to any fiber of @xmath31 gives rise to a spin curve .",
    "two families of spin curves @xmath27 and @xmath32 are _ isomorphic _ if there are isomorphisms @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath24 is compatible with the natural isomorphism between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "next , we put on @xmath52 the structure of of the quotient analytic space @xmath56 @xmath43 following @xcite ,   5",
    ". alternatively , we can regard @xmath52 as the coarse moduli space associated to the stack of @xmath57-spin curves ( in the easiest case @xmath58 ) , which has been constructed by jarvis in @xcite and revisited by abramovich and jarvis in @xcite .",
    "analogously to @xmath0 ( see @xcite , proposition  5.2 ) , the spaces @xmath52 are normal projective varieties of complex dimension @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 splits into two disjoint irreducible components @xmath62 and @xmath63 that consist of the even and the odd spin curves , respectively ( see @xcite , lemma  6.3 ) . similarly to lemma 1 in @xcite , we point out the following    [ iso ] let @xmath64 .",
    "there is a natural isomorphism @xmath65    since @xmath52 is normal , there is an injection : @xmath66 moreover , from the construction of @xmath52 it follows that the singularities of @xmath52 are of finite quotient type , so every weil divisor is @xmath67-cartier and there is a surjective morphism : @xmath68    hence the claim follows .",
    "we end this section with some results on the topology of @xmath3 , which will be applied in the next section when @xmath4 . in",
    "what follows , all homology and cohomology groups are intended to have rational coefficients .",
    "let us recall some general notions from @xcite ,   4 .",
    "a group @xmath69 is _ virtually torsion - free _ if it has a subgroup @xmath70 of finite index which is torsion free .",
    "if @xmath69 is virtually torsion free , the _ virtual cohomological dimension _ of @xmath69 is the cohomological dimension of a torsion free subgroup @xmath70 of finite index in @xmath69 . a theorem of serre states that this number is independent of the choice of @xmath70 ( see @xcite , p.  173 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the mapping class group @xmath71 is virtually torsion - free ( see for instance @xcite , p.  172 ) .",
    "moreover , harer proved that the virtual cohomological dimension of @xmath71 is @xmath72 ( see @xcite , theorem  4.1 ) .",
    "since the teichmller space @xmath73 is contractible , the rational homology of @xmath74 and @xmath71 is the same , so the group @xmath75 is zero for @xmath76 ( see @xcite , corollary  4.3 ) .",
    "let now @xmath77 be a smooth orientable surface of genus @xmath1 and let @xmath78 be a @xmath79-quadratic form on @xmath80 .",
    "the isomorphism class of @xmath78 is determined by its arf invariant @xmath81 or @xmath17 ( see @xcite , p. 324 ) . call @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) the even ( resp .",
    "the odd ) quadratic form and let @xmath84 be the subgroup of the mapping class group @xmath71 which preserves @xmath85 .",
    "then the following holds :    [ virtual ] for @xmath86 , @xmath84 is virtually torsion - free and its virtual cohomological dimension is @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the following homomorphism .",

    "since the target group is finite , the kernel @xmath92 of @xmath88 has finite index in @xmath71 .",
    "it is a straightforward consequence of the definitions that @xmath93 , hence we may deduce that @xmath84 has finite index in @xmath71 .",
    "now , pick a torsion - free subgroup @xmath94 of @xmath71 of finite index and consider @xmath95 .",
    "since both @xmath94 and @xmath84 have finite index in @xmath71 , it follows that @xmath96 has finite index in @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath94 is torsion - free , we have that @xmath96 is torsion - free . as mentioned before",
    ", all torsion - free subgroups of finite index in @xmath71 have the same cohomological dimension .",
    "therefore , from the previous two facts and harer s theorem we may deduce that the cohomological dimension of @xmath96 is @xmath72 . since @xmath96 has finite index in @xmath71 , it has finite index in @xmath84 too .",
    "thus , it computes the virtual cohomological dimension of @xmath84 .",
    "recall that @xmath3 is the disjoint union of @xmath97 , which contains curves with even theta - characteristics , and @xmath98 , which contains those with odd theta - characteristics .",
    "further , we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see @xcite , p. 324 ) .",
