    "the dynamics of hydrodynamic taylor - couette flow , in which fluid is driven between two coaxially rotating cylinders , is well understood .",
    "it is known , by rayleigh s stability criterion , that fluid is stable as angular momentum increases radially outward .",
    "however , electrically conducting fluid can be destabilised through the addition of a weak axial magnetic field @xcite and it is this magnetorotational instability ( mri ) that is proposed to be the mechanism allowing for outward angular momentum transport in accretion disks @xcite : a turbulent process that can not be attributed to laminar viscous effects .",
    "since its discovery the mri has been the subject of numerous publications , for which we refer to the review by @xcite .",
    "similarly , if one produces a purely azimuthal field by running a current through the fluid , even without rotation one may excite the current - driven tayler instability ( or taylor - vandakurov instability ) @xcite .",
    "this is fundamentally different to the mri in that instead of receiving energy from differential rotation , it is driven by the imposed current .",
    "the tayler instability ( ti ) has numerous astrophysical applications , for example , in the stability of stars , as in tayler s original investigation , in radiative stellar cores for which there is near solid body rotation , and the tayler - spruit dynamo @xcite , for which it provides the @xmath3-effect .",
    "further industrial applications include liquid metal batteries @xcite , though it has recently been shown @xcite that the tayler instability is too weak to disrupt the electrolyte layer in the batteries .",
    "it is reasonable to have a scenario in which there is differential rotation , as well as an imposed axial field and a current generated azimuthal field in the taylor - couette problem .",
    "the focus of this paper is then , given that mri and tayler instabilities can occur in similar parameter regimes , how would the interaction between them affect the resulting instability ?    experiments involving the mri and tayler instabilities are of particular interest , with the first involving the standard mri ( smri ) suggested independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , it was clear that any experiment would be particularly difficult to realise , due to the relevant parameters being @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the magnetic reynolds number and lundquist numbers , respectively .",
    "as later reiterated by @xcite , the difficulty arises due to the requirement that @xmath6 , which , given that laboratory fluids have @xmath7 and @xmath8 , would require @xmath9 . at such large rotation rates , the taylor - proudman theorem states that any flow would be dominated by the conditions at the endplates .",
    "it is not surprising that the smri has not yet been achieved @xcite .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "if an additional azimuthal magnetic field , @xmath10 , is applied to the fluid a new helical type of magnetorotational instability is found for which rm is no longer the relevant parameter , allowing instability at experimentally feasible values of @xmath11 .",
    "this axisymmetric mri variant [ now known as the helical mri ( hmri ) ] has been subsequently observed in the promise experiments with good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "it has since been shown by @xcite that this observed hmri is self - sustaining , rather than a transient growth as was suggested previously .",
    "a further nonaxisymmetric mri variant is produced if one now considers the case in which only an azimuthal magnetic field @xmath12 is present .",
    "this azimuthal mri ( amri ) , first discussed theoretically by @xcite , has also been shown to depend on the parameters re and ha instead of rm and s @xcite and is thus achievable in laboratory fluids .",
    "indeed , recent work has shown experimental evidence for the amri @xcite .",
    "further analysis of the different types of mri , and in particular the amri , was included in a wkb approximation performed by @xcite .",
    "previous research had shown that the hmri was only able to exist for rotation profiles between two restrictive liu limits @xcite , with the possibility of instability at keplerian rotation profiles excluded @xcite for all inductionless forms of the mri .",
    "@xcite showed that the liu limits can be bypassed via variation of the azimuthal magnetic field s radial profile , allowing inductionless mri ( @xmath13 ) even under keplerian rotation .",
    "under further investigation @xcite , it was shown that this variation in azimuthal field profile leads to a connecting curve between the two liu limits .    by allowing for these deviations from the previously defined azimuthal magnetic field profile through generating the field by a combination of currents running through the core and fluid",
    ", interesting dynamics may occur .",
    "it is then possible to have both mri and current driven instabilities , which may occur in overlapping sections of parameter space .",
    "@xcite have examined this possibility for the case @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , @xcite has fully explored this for the axisymmetric hmri .",
    "this paper aims to extend these works to include all possible azimuthal magnetic field profiles and the more experimentally appropriate parameter @xmath15 respectively for nonaxisymmetric instability .",
    "we derive a set of perturbation equations that incorporate the azimuthal magnetic field configuration in terms of the ratio of current run through the core and fluid , and discuss the effect this has on onset of instability , both in general and in conjunction with changes to the rotation profile .",
    "furthermore , we comment on the applicability of the wkb theory results of kirillov _ et al .",
    "_ , such as the extension of the liu limits in the linear regime .",
    "we show that the choice of magnetic field profile can determine the kind of mode of instability excited , with small changes to the ratio of currents fundamentally changing the flow structure .",
    "finally , we examine the effects that axial field strength has on stability , and show evidence of the appearance of higher azimuthal mode - numbers for axially dominant magnetic fields as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we consider cylindrical taylor - couette flow with radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 and angular velocity @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the inner and outer cylinders , respectively . in order to allow any results to be examined experimentally , we take the inner and outer radii to be 4 and 8 cm , respectively , to match the geometry of the promise experiment @xcite , giving a relative gap width @xmath20 .    now , let us include a helical basic state magnetic field with components in the azimuthal and axial directions such that the axial field is generated externally and the azimuthal field by running a combination of currents in the core and the fluid itself .",
    "we consider a number of possibilities for the current configuration , including running current in solely the core or fluid and running current in both the core and fluid in the same , or opposite , direction .",
    "the system of equations we derive reduces to a one - dimensional generalised eigenvalue problem , however the inherent difficulty arises from the number of control parameters that govern the setup .",
    "we have freedom in choosing the angular velocity of both the inner and outer boundaries ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the relative strength of the axial magnetic field ; @xmath23 , and the relative strength of the components of the azimuthal field produced by the current in the core and the fluid ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we consider the basic state of the system , driven by the differential rotation of the two cylinders , as well as the background magnetic field .",
    "this gives a basic state velocity @xmath26 , with the standard taylor - couette angular velocity profile @xmath27 . here",

    ", scaling the magnetic field is nontrivial : nondimensionalizations must be valid for zero current in either the fluid or core , as well as equal and opposite currents .",
    "the best choice is ultimately to scale both basic state and perturbation magnetic fields with @xmath37 , the rms mean of @xmath31 .",

    "we linearise the governing equations about the basic state , expressing the perturbation flow and magnetic field , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as a toroidal - poloidal decomposition to satisfy the @xmath52 conditions ,    @xmath53    we then expand in terms of normal modes , @xmath54 , etc .",
    ", such that @xmath55 is the ( complex ) growth rate and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the azimuthal and axial wave numbers , respectively . taking the @xmath58-components of the curl and double curl of the navier - stokes equations , as well as the induction equation and its curl , we obtain the following set of eigenvalue equations :    @xmath59    where the coefficients are mostly the same as those given by @xcite , with the differences being ,    @xmath60    here , as in @xcite we use the notation @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we then optimise to obtain the most unstable axial wavenumber @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting code has been benchmarked against previous results from both @xcite , as well as another independently written code .",

    "one instance used a flat rotation law @xmath83 , as well as the nearly uniform azimuthal field corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "rdiger @xmath1 @xmath2 . claimed that for this value of pm there is a stable separating region between the amri and tayler instabilities where the differential rotation stabilises the tayler instability .",
    "when run over the same re and ha range , we recover the results of rdiger @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    ", however upon considering a larger range for re and ha a relatively weak region of instability occurs between the two ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pm1weak ] ) .",
    "this feature is made more apparent when considering insulating boundary conditions , where the weak instability appears for values of re and ha inside the range rdiger @xmath1 @xmath2 . examined .",
    "it has recently been established by @xcite that this weak instability is due to the destabilisation of chandrasekhar s equipartition solution , and it is shown via the analytic wkb solution that the dissipation - induced instability develops into the amri as @xmath13 .",
    "this has since been confirmed numerically by @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar s original investigation @xcite showed that when a flow of velocity @xmath33 is aligned with the magnetic field of alfv@xmath85n velocity @xmath86 , @xmath87 , the flow is stable .",

    "this has radially aligned profiles for @xmath33 and @xmath96 , and thus for @xmath14 is the equipartition @xmath97 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm1weak ] .",
    "this destabilisation is markedly different in both its location in parameter space and its growth rate when comparing perfectly conducting and insulating boundaries and adds nicely to the cases of @xmath98 and @xmath99 examined by @xcite , as it shows clearly the comparative weakness of the instability on the equipartition line .",
    "we now focus solely on the near - inductionless limit , @xmath15 , a value typical of liquid metals .",
    "we first consider the effect of changing the parameter @xmath42 , corresponding to the ratio of currents running though the fluid and core , when there is no axial field @xmath45 applied .",

    "we find that , for @xmath104 at least , increasing @xmath42 makes the amri more unstable to both re and ha ( fig .",
    "[ fig : azitaupos ] ) .",
    "the ha threshold of instability of the tayler instability is also affected , with more positive values of @xmath42 allowing for the tayler instability to be excited at lower values of ha , before reaching a limit as @xmath105 .",
    "this is not surprising , as it is well known that the tayler instability is at its most unstable when the azimuthal field is produced solely by current in the fluid @xcite .",
    "the onset of the tayler instability can be seen to rapidly approach its fully current - driven limit for values of @xmath42 as low as @xmath106 , with a value @xmath107 giving an excellent approximation for solely current - driven instability .",
    "further interesting behaviour is seen when we allow @xmath42 to be negative , i.e. running current through the core and fluid in different directions ( fig .",

    "for moderately negative @xmath42 the tayler instability is much more difficult to excite in the hartmann parameter than the corresponding positive @xmath42 value , likely due to unfavourable alignment of field and flow .",

    "we expand upon this to include @xmath28 upwards of the rayleigh limit for the non - zero @xmath42 .",
    "we recall that it is well known that increasing @xmath28 makes the amri more stable , however as noted by @xcite , carefully changing the field profile @xmath42 can allow for instability even at large values of @xmath28 , though one might expect the reynolds number required for its onset to be experimentally unachievable .",
    "much like the weak instability of chandrasekhar s equipartition solution found when benchmarking at @xmath14 , it is likely that a similarly weak instability occurs at the inductionless limit . here in conjunction with @xmath42",
    ", @xmath28 determines the existence of the stable equipartition region between the two instabilities , with lower values of @xmath28 giving a smooth transition between the amri and tayler instability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : muweak ] , which is near a point in parameter space on the chandrasekhar line that intersects with the liu limit connecting curve given in @xcite , we vary @xmath28 while keeping @xmath42 constant .",
    "we see evidence of the way in which chandrasekhar s weak equipartition instability and corresponding stable separating region change by altering the value @xmath91 , with the onset of instability becoming less attainable as @xmath91 decreases .",
    "figure [ fig : muweak ] also alludes to the validity of kirillov _ et al . _ s connecting curve in the linear regime through the behaviour of the amri , where the slight increases in @xmath28 does indeed bring the regime closer to the stable region kirillov",
    "_ et al .  _ identified .",
    "it can be seen that the amri does become stable to linear instability as this region is entered .",
    "note that the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 used by kirillov @xmath1 @xmath2 . may be expressed in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath42 using @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the keplerian value of @xmath126 corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "through further computations at various values of @xmath28 and @xmath42 we may confirm , for at least a small section , the validity of kirillov _ et al . _",

    "[ fig : muweak ] , for different values of @xmath128 that adjusting @xmath42 heavily affects the stability of the amri , with an earlier onset of stability , ( in re and ha ) , as @xmath42 increases away from the stable region .",
    "for @xmath42 close to the connecting curve , as well as higher values of @xmath28 , the re instability threshold increases rapidly , meaning that even though by increasing @xmath42 it is theoretically possible to attain the amri for very flat rotation profiles , the reynolds number required eliminates the possibility of reproducing this experimentally .",
    "finally we note that our linear stability analysis is only able to confirm a small segment of kirillov _ et al . _",

    "we do however show strong agreement with their wkb analysis for this region .",
    "having fully examined the sensible parameter ranges for purely azimuthal fields , we now add an axial field to the system with relative strength given by @xmath45 .",
    "much of the previous discussion involving the amri in the presence of purely azimuthal magnetic fields still holds : @xmath42 and @xmath28 understandably have the same effects on stability , and the results regarding kirillov _",
    "_ s connecting curve remain largely the same .",
    "the main additions here stem from separation of @xmath132 due to the innate handedness of the helical field and the stabilising or destabilising effect of the relative strength of the poloidal field .",
    "this axial field also allows for a resonance - like appearance of higher @xmath56 modes , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "note that though we may take @xmath45 to be negative , it is unnecessary as this is equivalent to positive @xmath45 with an oppositely signed azimuthal wave number @xmath56 .",
    "the relative strength of the azimuthal field in the system has a large effect on the instabilities that exist . with a very weak axial component",

    "progressively stronger axial fields however work to either stabilise or destabilise ( depending on the handedness of the flow ) the tayler instability and mri to nonaxisymmetric instabilities .",
    "axial fields that far outweigh the azimuthal fields simply return the smri , which is far more stable to differential rotation @xcite",

    "even when accounting for the inherent destabilisation gained by generating the azimuthal field through current in the fluid , increasing @xmath45 by small values has a marked effect , making the nonaxisymmetric helical mri more stable to both increasing rotation speed and total field strength . by @xmath134 ,",

    "indeed , for the negative values of @xmath42 given here the banded nature of the mode number @xmath56 can be seen in the @xmath165 pattern given by kirillov _",

    "( if one removes the @xmath166 hmri mode ) . the same overall dependences can be seen for the tayler instability when taking @xmath167 .",
    "when considering the reynolds stability as @xmath45 is varied , we note that , aside from a small range around @xmath112 , it is the @xmath136 mode that is most unstable for all values @xmath45 .",
    "this is interesting in that it suggests that , while more unstable @xmath168 modes do appear at higher @xmath45 in a resonant fashion , they are more unstable to increases in the magnetic field strength , not rotation rate .",
    "this suggests that increasing the magnetic field strength drives the higher modes comparatively more than @xmath136 , whereas the rotation favours no mode in particular .",
    "in the present work we have fully explored the relevant parameter space for the nonaxisymmetric mri variants , highlighting a number of instability results as well as confirming others in the linear regime .",
    "we have shown clearly the large effect that the steepness of the magnetic field profile has on the onset of stability for both the mri and tayler instability , with fields generated by running current in the fluid allowing for earlier onset of marginal instability , and the effect this has on the flow structure of the non - axisymmetric helical mri modes , showing in fig .",
    "[ fig:2modeeig ] the two different types of modes that may be excited .",
    "we have added to previous work concerning chandrasekhar s equipartition , showing clearly the comparative weakness in the growth of this instability as well as giving an alternative example .",
    "further to this , we have shown evidence of the location of sections of kirillov _ et al . _ s connecting curve between the liu limits in the linear regime , and have shown the existence of the higher @xmath56 modes previously predicted for axially dominated fields , offering confirmation to the validity of their wkb analysis in the linear regime , as well as the ` banded ' nature of the modes .",
    "we identify a number of possible avenues for further work .",
    "in particular , for the two different modes structures present in fig .",
    "[ fig:2modeeig ] , the question remains as to why each of the two modes is dominant for either side of @xmath169 , and what significance , if any , the value @xmath170 , ( at which both modes are stabilised in a purely toroidal field ) , holds .",
    "a full asymptotic analysis of our perturbation equations around this parameter range may prove to be fruitful in exploring this question .",
