    "under the conditions of low temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic field , a two - dimensional electron gas exhibits a striking macroscopic manifestation of a quantum phenomenon , namely the quantum hall effect @xcite : the hall conductivity exhibits quantized plateaus at well defined multiples of @xmath0 ( a fundamental constant ) . in not too clean samples , where the rle of random impurities ( disorder ) is more important than electron - electron interactions ,",
    "the plateaus occur at integer multiples of @xmath0 giving rise to the so - called integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) .",
    "it is widely believed that in the absence of a magnetic field , all wavefunctions for non - interacting , disordered electrons in two dimensions are localized . in the presence of a magnetic field however",
    ", a delocalized state occurs at the centre of the ( disorder broadened ) landau level , with energy @xmath1 .",
    "as one tunes the electron energy @xmath2 ( by varying the magnetic field ) , through the centre of a landau level , the localization length , @xmath3 , diverges as @xmath4 , where numerical simulations indicate that @xmath5 . , the number of states with wave functions that reach the boundaries is @xmath6 .",
    "since the density of states , @xmath7 , remains a smooth function of energy , this number is always macroscopic .",
    "however , the density of delocalized states @xmath8 and goes to zero in the limit of infinite sample size . ]",
    "the plateaus with differing @xmath9 are separated by these critical points .",
    "a theoretical description of these points remains one of the most challenging unresolved problems in the theory of disordered systems .",
    "the supersymmetric sigma model describing disordered landau levels has a high symmetry .",
    "so we are lead to believe that the model describing the critical point has at least that symmetry or even higher .",
    "this constitutes a difficulty because on one hand all known critical theories with internal symmetry have at least one free parameter ( for instance , for wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) models it would be the level ) and , on the other hand , there is no such free parameter for iqhe critical point . in our previous paper we concentrated on properties of ldos since this is a much simplier problem than a calculation of conductances . with ldos one can work with a closed system and not to worry about boundary conditions .",
    "the first assumption of our work is that the operators representing ldos constitutes a decoupled sector of the theory .",
    "therefore though the system in its entirety is described by some ( yet unknown ) supersymmetric theory , the ldos sector is much simplier .",
    "this assumption was based on the research conducted for one - dimensional limit of the relevant supersymmetric sigma model , where the decoupling of ldos sector was demonstrated explicitely @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results led us to conclusion that the most likely candidate for the theory describing critical ldos was the h@xmath10 wznw model .",
    "@xmath11 wznw model is defined on a non - compact space sl(2,c)/su(2 ) . since this space differs from the group space sl(2,r ) only by the signature of its metric tensor ( it is ( + , + , + ) in the former case and ( + , + , - ) in the latter one ) , it is legitimate to consider it as a wznw model and not a coset one .    in the gaussian parametrization",
    "the action can be written as    @xmath12.\\ ] ]    in the semiclassical limit @xmath13 the primary fields satisfy the diffusion equation on the h@xmath10 space : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this equation provides a natural link between the 2d wznw model and the work done on one - dimensional sigma model .",
    "it was found that the eigenfunctions of the corresponding transfer matrix satisfy a similar equation : @xmath17 where the @xmath18-th power of ldos @xmath19 was identified as @xmath20 .",
    "this identification naturally follows from the form of the correlation function of ldos derived in @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 is obvious : w(y ) ~^2 ( , ^ , y ) ,   kk^ * = 1[w ] to identify the operator @xmath19 one has to recall some facts from the representation theory .    the primary fields @xmath23 of the h@xmath10 model belong to representations of the sl(2,r ) group with angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "the auxilary coordinate @xmath25 parametrizes the action of generators of the algebra sl(2 ) represented as differential operators : ^+_j = -x^2_x + 2jx ,  d^0_j = - x_x + j ,   d^-_j = - _ x the coordinates @xmath26 parametrize a direction of the quantization axis ; this is reflected in the field parametrization used in the majority of papers on the h@xmath10 model : ^(j ) ( , ^ , y = ^-2 ) = ( |- x|^2^ + ^-)^2j [ standard ] since these eigenfunctions depend on @xmath27 , one can replace in eq.([w ] ) the integration over @xmath28 by the integration over @xmath25 and identify : w_j(y ) = ( -2j)^2 x ^j(x|z ) ,   kk^ * = 1 [ w1 ] where semiclassically w_j(y=^-2 ) = 2 ^ -k_(1 + 2j)(2 ^ - ) [ w2 ]    to establish a relationship between field @xmath29 and ( [ standard ] ) , let us recall that the scaling dimensions of h@xmath10 primaries are d(j ) = - where @xmath30 is the level of the corresponding kac - moody algebra . as is known from the numerical simulations , the scaling dimension the @xmath18-th power of ldos fits to this formula with @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this publication has also explained that the deviations from the parabolic dependence reported in the earlier work @xcite had their origin in the finite size effects .",
    "the fact that the corresponding value of @xmath33 is not an integer does not constitute a problem for the @xmath11 theory , since in non - compact models @xmath34 is not quantized .",
    "however , this probably means that the parent supersymmetric theory which includes in itself a compact sector , can not possess kac - moody symmetry .",
    "this supports the point of view of zirnbauer who rejected kac - moody symmetry for iqhe critical point @xcite .",
    "so we suggest that @xmath19 is related to the primary field with @xmath31 . to extract it from @xmath35",
    "is the same as to extract @xmath29 from expression ( [ standard ] ) , which can be done by integration around a contour encircling infinity : ( 2q ) = _ cx_c|x",
    "x^(2q -1)|x^(2q -1)^(j = -q)(x,|x , z , |z )",
    "in our previous paper we argued that in order to reproduce existing results on correlation functions of ldos , one has to consider a certain modification of the @xmath36 wznw model .",
    "namely , @xmath37-point correlation functions of ldos should be understood as @xmath38-point function with two additional operators @xmath39 present at zero and infinity . in cylindrical geometry",
    "these points become minus and plus infinity respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath39 was identified as a non - trivial operator with zero conformal dimension .",
    "primary fields of @xmath36 wznw model have been classified and their fusion rules are known .",
    "therefore we have to find @xmath39 among these operators .",
    "it turns out that such non - trivial ( that is non unity ) operator can be identified as _ 0(x|z ) = _ j 0j^-1^j(x|z ) this limit is well defined semiclassically as follows from relation ( [ w2 ] ) . to make sure it holds in quantum field theory",
    ", one can study the fusion rules .",
    "let us consider a three - point correlation function of primary fields in the @xmath36 model @xcite,@xcite : & & < ^j_1(x_1|z_1)^j_2(x_2|z_2)^j_3(x_3|z_3 ) > = + & & [ three ] where the structure constant @xmath40 is the clebsh - gordon coefficient for the sl(2,r ) group .",
    "c_123 = |x_12|^2(j_1 + j_2 - j_3)|x_13|^2(j_1 + j_3 - j_2)|x_23|^2(j_2 + j_3 - j_1 ) and @xmath41 is the quantum correction given by & & d_123 = [ quant ] + & & where @xmath42 the function @xmath43 is a meromorphic function introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has zeroes at @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 this function admits the integral representation & & y_w(- x ) = \\{_0^ } , + & & 0 < e x < ( 1 + k ) outside this interval it can be defined using the following properties : _",
    "w(j ) = y_w(j -1 ) ,  y_w(j ) = y_w(j - k ) k^-(2j + 1 ) since at @xmath47 the function @xmath48 , formula ( [ three ] ) has a simple semiclassical limit corresponding to the quantum mechanics of a free particle on the @xmath11 space .",
    "the property crucial for our argument is the fact that structure constant @xmath41 contains the product of @xmath49-functions which vanishes when one of the angular momenta goes to zero . since @xmath50 at @xmath51",
    ", we get from ( [ three ] ) : & & ^2 x_2 |x_2|^(4q - 2 ) < ^j_1(x_1|z_1)^-q(x_2|z_2)_0(0|0 ) > = + & & |x_1|^2(j_1 + q ) [ three1 ] d(j_1,-q ) = [ quant1 ] when two operators have @xmath51 we get : & & < _ 0(x_1|0)[]^q(z)_0(x_3| ) > =    & & a(q ) = as it was mentioned above , we suggested that the two - point disorder average of @xmath18-th powers of ldos should be understood as the four - point function of the @xmath11 theory . in the cylindrical geometry where @xmath52 i get the following expression : & & = ^2 x ^*k x * + & & = + & & |2r(w/2r)|^- 2d_q^2 x ( x,|x;z,|z ) ,  z = ( w_12/r ) to derive the latter formula i used the fact that the confomal blocks depend only on the anharmonic ratios of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "function @xmath55 satisfies the following differential equation : & & _ x^2f + + & & _ xf + k_zf = 0 at the moment i am still unable to present a complete solution of this equation ."
