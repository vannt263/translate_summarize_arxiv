    "it has been known for a long time since angell @xcite has proposed a famous classification in viscosities of glass - forming materials that there exist two types of glass - forming liquids , fragile liquids ( f ) and strong liquids ( s ) , near the glass transition @xcite .",
    "the systems with short - range interactions such as @xmath11-terphenyl and glycerol are typical examples of fragile liquids , while the covalently bonded network glass formers such as sio@xmath12 and geo@xmath12 are known as typical examples of strong liquids .",
    "thus , it has been understood commonsensically since then that the transport coefficients of both liquids , such as viscosity and self - diffusion coefficient , are well described by the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) law @xcite , although the fitting temperature range for strong liquids is shorter than that for fragile liquids .",
    "however , it is not clear yet how the dynamics of strong liquids is different from that of fragile liquids in a supercooled state .",
    "thus , it is still important to clarify it not only qualitatively but also quantitatively from a unified point of view .    in order to classify the long - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath13 into two types of glass forming liquids from a unified point of view consistently",
    ", tokuyama @xcite has recently shown that the @xmath14- and @xmath15-relaxation times , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , obey power laws @xmath18 and @xmath19 in a supercooled state , where the exponent @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 for ( f ) and 2/11 for ( s ) .",
    "then , the following master curve @xmath22 for @xmath13 has been proposed : @xmath23 , \\label{1 - 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a fictive singular temperature to be determined and @xmath25 a positive constant to be determined . here",
    "the exponent @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 ; @xmath28 for ( f ) and 5/3 for ( s ) .",
    "thus , it has been shown by analyzing many different data that both types of liquids are well described by two types of master curves up to the deviation point @xmath29 , below which all the data start to deviate from them and obey the arrhenius law , where @xmath30 .",
    "here we note that @xmath29 coincides with the so - called thermodynamic glass transition temperature @xmath31 and the master curves can be also fitted by the vft law well for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thus , all the diffusion data in each type collapse onto each single master curve @xmath22 ( see fig . [ d ] ) .",
    "their material differences are just characterized by a set of parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . from this viewpoint , therefore , those parameters may correspond to the so - called degree of fragility usually discussed among different systems @xcite .",
    "one can now distinguish the long - time self - diffusion coefficient of strong liquids from that of fragile liquids safely by using the master curve @xmath22 . by using such a master curve ,",
    "we have recently succeeded in creating a new type of strong liquids which is different from usual network glass formers @xcite .",
    "in fact , the static structure factor @xmath33 of usual network glass formers has the so - called first sharp diffraction peak , which is related to the size of tetrahedron in sio@xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ sq ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", that of a new type does not have such a peak and its structural properties are the same as those of fragile liquids .",
    "thus , there exists another type of strong liquids , that is , non - network glass formers ( s@xmath34 ) , in addition to usual network glass formers ( s@xmath35 ) .",
    "although both types can be classified as strong liquids by using the same master curve @xmath22 with @xmath36 , it is not possible to clarify how a new type is different from the usual strong one .",
    "this situation is also true for other materials such as se which has a network structure and is usually believed to be a fragile system .",
    "it is interesting to know whether se is a fragile liquid ( f@xmath35 ) or not .",
    "however , those materials are not investigated here because there is no simulation data available .    in the present paper , by using the mean-@xmath0th displacement @xmath37 ) , we only investigate the dynamics of glass - forming materials ( f@xmath34 ) , ( s@xmath35 ) , and ( s@xmath34 ) from a unified point of view based on the mean - field theory @xcite , where @xmath38 is a position vector of @xmath39th atom @xmath14 at time @xmath40 , the brackets an average over the equilibrium ensemble , and @xmath0 even numbers .",
    "analyses of many data then suggest an existence of a master curve @xmath2 for @xmath1 in each type as @xmath41 where @xmath5 is the characteristic length such as an interatomic distance , @xmath7 the average thermal velocity , and @xmath39=f@xmath34 , s@xmath35 , and s@xmath34 . any data in each type are thus shown to collapse onto a single master curve @xmath2 at the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "then , we also show that even at the same value of @xmath4 the master curve @xmath2 for type @xmath39 does not coincide at all with @xmath42 for other type @xmath43 in the cage region for @xmath44 , in which each particle behaves as if it is trapped in a cage mostly formed by neighboring particles , where @xmath45 is a mean - free time before which each particle undergoes a ballistic motion . on the other hand , @xmath2 and @xmath42 @xmath46",
    "are easily shown to coincide with each other both for a short - time region ( @xmath47 ) and for a long - time region ( @xmath48 ) at the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , for both time regions we have @xmath49 with @xmath50 where @xmath51 . thus",
    ", we emphasize that an explicit disagreement in the dynamics of each type appears only in the cage region , although the analytic form of @xmath2 is not known there yet .",
    "finally , we note that although the even number @xmath0 is taken up to 6 here for simplicity , the same results as those discussed in the present paper also hold for @xmath52 .",
    "we begin in section ii by briefly reviewing the mean - field theory recently proposed .",
    "we first discuss the mean - field equation for the mean - square displacement and its related characteristic times .",
    "then , we show two types of master curves for the long - time self - diffusion coefficient . one is a master curve for fragile liquids and another is for strong liquids . in section iii ,",
    "we introduce several potentials to perform extensive molecular - dynamics simulations . in section iv",
    ", we briefly review how physical quantities satisfy the universality near the glass transition .",
    "based on such a universality , we then show that there exist a master curve @xmath2 for the mean-@xmath0th displacement in each liquid , ( f@xmath34 ) , ( s@xmath35 ) , and ( s@xmath34 ) . in section",
    "v , we show that the master curves @xmath2 and @xmath42 in different types @xmath39 and @xmath43 do not coincide with each other in the cage region even at the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a summary .",
    "here we briefly summarize the mean - field theory of the glass transition ( mft ) for molecular systems recently proposed by tokuyama @xcite . the mean - field theory consists of the following two essential points : ( a ) mean - field equation for @xmath53 and ( b ) two different types of singular functions for @xmath13 , the mean - field curve @xmath54 for a liquid state and the master curve @xmath55 for a supercooled state , where @xmath56 and @xmath24 are fictive singular temperatures to be determined and @xmath57 .",
    "the mean - square displacement @xmath53 of @xmath39th particle @xmath14 in molecular systems is described by a nonlinear equation @xcite @xmath58e^{-m_2(t)/\\ell^2},\\label{2 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a mean - free path of particle @xmath14 over which the particle can move freely by a ballistic motion and @xmath60 the average thermal velocity .",
    "equation ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) can be easily solved to give a formal solution @xmath61 , \\label{2 - 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 denotes a time for a particle to diffuse over a distance of order @xmath59 with the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 and is identical to the so - called @xmath15-relaxation time . here",
    "@xmath63 is a mean - free time , within which each particle can move freely by a ballistic motion .",
    "the solution ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) satisfies the asymptotic forms given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 4 ] ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mean - free path @xmath59 is uniquely determined by @xmath64 .",
    "hence the solution ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) suggests that the dynamics is described by only one parameter @xmath65 if the length and the time are scaled by @xmath5 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "this means that the dynamics in different systems coincides with each other if @xmath65 has the same value in them .",
    "hence this is called a universality in dynamics . since the single - particle dynamics",
    "is determined by only one parameter @xmath64 , it is convenient to introduce a new parameter @xmath67 by @xcite @xmath68 as @xmath67 increases ( or @xmath69 decreases ) , there exist three states ; a liquid state [ l ] for @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) , a supercooled state [ s ] for @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) , and a glass state [ g ] for @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) , where @xmath76 is a supercooled point and @xmath31 a glass transition point .",
    "the values of @xmath77 are listed in table [ table-01 ] . here",
    "@xmath78 ( or @xmath76 ) is determined by the intersection point of the mean - field curve @xmath54 with the master curve @xmath79 @xcite and coincides with a peak position of a specific heat , while @xmath80 ( or @xmath31 ) is determined by a deviation point @xmath29 at which the simulation results and the experimental data for the long - time self - diffusion coefficient start to deviate from the master curve @xmath79 since @xmath29 coincides with the thermodynamic glass transition point @xcite .",
    "thus , the mean - field fitting values for the mean - free path @xmath81 and the @xmath15-relaxation time @xmath82 are uniquely determined by @xmath67 . in general , however , the length @xmath5 is not known . as a well - known example in which @xmath5 is known",
    ", one can take the lennard - jones ( lj ) binary mixtures a@xmath83b@xmath84 , where the lj potential @xmath85 is given by @xmath86.\\label{2 - 3 - 1}\\ ] ] here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a length unit and @xmath94 an energy unit @xcite .",
    "then , one can choose @xmath93 as @xmath5 for a particle .",
    "thus , one can use the simulation results for the lj binary mixtures as reference to determine @xmath5 for fragile systems based on the universality .",

    ", the dynamics of si is shown to be different from that of a ( @xmath97 ) , although both glass formers obey the strong master curve given by @xmath110 .",

    "<S> the systematic method to explore how the dynamics of strong liquids ( s ) is different from that of fragile liquids ( f ) near the glass transition is proposed from a unified point of view based on the mean - field theory discussed recently by tokuyama . </S>",
    "<S> the extensive molecular - dynamics simulations are performed on different glass - forming materials . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results for the mean-@xmath0th displacement @xmath1 are then analyzed from the unified point of view , where @xmath0 is an even number . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is first shown that in each type of liquids there exists a master curve @xmath2 as @xmath3 onto which any simulation results collapse at the same value of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a characteristic length such as an interatomic distance , @xmath6 a long - time self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath7 a thermal velocity , and @xmath8f and s. the master curves @xmath9 and @xmath10 are then shown not to coincide with each other in the so - called cage region even at the same value of @xmath4 . thus , it is emphasized that the dynamics of strong liquids is quite different from that of fragile liquids . </S>",
    "<S> a new type of strong liquids recently proposed is also tested systematically from this unified point of view . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a new type is then shown to be different from that of well - known network glass formers in the cage region , although both liquids are classified as a strong liquid . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is suggested that a smaller grouping is further needed in strong liquids , depending on whether they have a network or not . </S>"
