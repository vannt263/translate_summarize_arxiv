    "it has been pointed out that @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) holds exactly , if either the conditions @xmath9 and @xmath10 or the conditions @xmath30 and @xmath10 are satisfied @xcite . however , this interesting @xmath5-@xmath6 permutation symmetry must be broken : on the one hand , the fact that @xmath0 is not strongly suppressed has recently been established in the daya bay and reno reactor antineutrino oscillation experiments @xcite ; on the other hand , the latest global fit of all the available neutrino oscillation data hints that the value of @xmath1 might have an appreciable deviation from @xmath2 @xcite . an important task in today s experimental neutrino physics is therefore to determine the strength of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking , so as to help the theorists try different flavor symmetries and deeply understand the leptonic flavor mixing structure @xcite .    the neutrino telescopes ( e.g. , the running icecube detector at the south pole @xcite and the proposed km3net detector in the mediterranean sea @xcite ) , which aim to observe the ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos and their flavor distributions , can serve as a novel probe of the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking effects .",
    "it is well known that neutrino oscillations may map @xmath31 , the initial flavor ratios of uhe cosmic neutrino fluxes produced from @xmath32 or @xmath33 collisions at a distant astrophysical source , into @xmath34 at a neutrino telescope on the earth @xcite if there is the exact @xmath5-@xmath6 permutation symmetry .",

    "for most of the currently - envisaged sources of uhe cosmic neutrinos @xcite , a general expectation is that the initial neutrino fluxes are produced via the decay chain of charged pions and muons created from @xmath33 or @xmath32 collisions and their flavor content can be expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and @xmath47 is the total flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors .",

    "let us proceed to look at the effect of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking on the flavor distribution of uhe cosmic neutrinos at a neutrino telescope by detecting the @xmath17 flux from a distant astrophysical source through the gr channel @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "18 ) may in practice be contaminated by @xmath149 , which is very likely to overwhelm the @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking effect @xmath150 .",
    "we also admit that our treatment does not take account of the other complexities and uncertainties associated with the origin of uhe cosmic neutrinos , such as their energy dependence , the effect of magnetic fields and even possible new physics @xcite .",
    "it is still too early to say that we have correctly understood the production mechanism of uhe cosmic rays and neutrinos from a given cosmic accelerator .",
    "but the progress made in the measurement of lepton flavor mixing parameters is quite encouraging , and it may finally allow us to well control the error bars from particle physics ( e.g. , the effect of @xmath5-@xmath6 symmetry breaking ) and thus concentrate on the unknowns from astrophysics ( e.g. , the initial flavor composition of uhe cosmic neutrinos ) .",
    "we believe that any constraint on the flavor distribution of uhe cosmic neutrinos to be achieved from a neutrino telescope will be greatly useful in diagnosing the astrophysical sources and in understanding the properties of neutrinos themselves . much more efforts are therefore needed to make in this direction .",
