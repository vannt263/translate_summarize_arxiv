    "in recent years the networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators have attracted much attention : they serve as a prototype model for a variety of self - organizing systems in physics , chemistry , biology , and social sciences , and exhibit the remarkable phenomena of synchronization  @xcite . among those the system with global coupling has been mostly studied both analytically and numerically , owing to analytical simplicity and some physical as well as biological applications  @xcite . in such a system of globally coupled oscillators , effects of nonzero inertia and of noise as well as",
    "effects of periodic driving on synchronization have been examined  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in the presence of noise is the possible amplification of the response of the system , arising from the interplay between the noise and driving  @xcite . such stochastic resonance phenomena , having various potential applications ,",
    "have received much attention  @xcite .",
    "recently , the interesting possibility of stochastic resonance in systems without external periodic driving has been pointed out  @xcite .",
    "for example , noise - controlled resonance behavior in a periodic potential with constant driving has been discussed , and in the limit of low damping the inertia has been shown to play as a surrogate of external periodic driving  @xcite . while such noise - induced resonance behavior has been investigated in oscillator systems with relatively few degrees of freedom , typically single oscillator systems , or in systems of excitable elements  @xcite , the possibility of detecting the resonance behavior in a system of coupled ( non - excitable ) oscillators has not been properly addressed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine whether such noise - induced resonance behavior can appear in a coupled oscillator system with many degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus consider the system of globally coupled stochastic oscillators , each possessing finite inertia , subject to constant driving force , and investigate the behavior of the order parameter , which measures the synchronization of the system , as the noise level and the coupling strength are varied . to understand the interplay of noise and driving force , giving rise to the possibility of noise - induced resonance behavior in the absence of periodic driving ,",
    "we further consider the power spectrum of the phase velocity as the response to the driving force , and investigate both the zero - frequency ( dc ) component and the nonzero - frequency ( ac ) one .",
    "the dc component of the power spectrum , proportional to the squared time average of the phase velocity , measures the probability that the system , kicked by noise , eventually escapes out of a potential - well minimum .",
    "namely , it describes the inter - well transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the ac component describes the intra - well oscillation behavior , which does not induce the escape out of the potential - well minimum .",
    "the order parameter is observed to decrease with noise , manifesting suppression of synchronization , and to display hysteretic behavior with the noise level as well as with the coupling strength .",
    "suppression of synchronization is also reflected by growth of the dc component of the power spectrum , corresponding to the dispersion of the mean phase velocity , with noise .",
    "on the other hand , it is found that the generalized susceptibility , related to the power spectrum via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , increases first as the noise grows from zero , reaches its maximum at a finite noise level , and eventually decreases as the noise level is increased further .",
    "such noise - induced effects are also observed in the quality factor at appropriate nonzero frequencies , suggesting the presence of intra - well resonance .",
    "this paper consists of five sections : section ii introduces the system of coupled oscillators , each possessing finite inertia , subject to random noise and constant driving force . the self - consistency equation for the order parameter , which measures collective synchronization in the system is described . in sec .",
    "iii , the behavior of the order parameter with the coupling strength and the noise level is investigated , which manifests hysteretic behavior at low noise levels .",
    "section iv is devoted to the investigation of the response of the phase velocity to the external driving force , focusing on the interplay between noise and driving .",
    "the power spectrum of the phase velocity is revealed to exhibit noise - induced resonance in appropriate regimes .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "we begin with the set of equations of motion governing the dynamics of @xmath0 coupled oscillators , the @xmath1th of which is described by its phase @xmath2 @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the magnitude of the ( rotational ) inertia relative to the damping . the third term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) denotes the global coupling with strength @xmath6 , whereas the first and the second on the right - hand side represent the constant driving force and the random ( thermal ) noise , respectively .",
    "the driving force @xmath7 is distributed over the whole oscillators according to the distribution @xmath8 , which is assumed to be smooth and symmetric about @xmath9 .",
    "the term @xmath10 represents independent white noise with zero mean and correlations @xmath11 where the noise level @xmath12 plays the role of the `` effective temperature '' of the system .",
    "the set of equations of motion in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) describes a superconducting wire network  @xcite and may also be regarded as the mean - field version of an array of resistively and capacitively shunted junctions , which serves as a common model for describing the dynamics of superconducting arrays  @xcite . in these cases , the constant driving force @xmath13 corresponds to the direct current bias .",
    "collective behavior of such an @xmath0-oscillator system is conveniently described by the complex order parameter @xmath14 where non - vanishing magnitude @xmath15 indicates the emergence of collective synchronization and @xmath16 gives the average phase .",
    "note that the synchronized state corresponds to the superconducting state with global phase coherence in the case of superconducting networks or arrays  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ deforder ] ) allows us to reduce eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) into a _",
    "single _ decoupled equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath16 are to be determined by imposing self - consistency .",
    "namely , the order parameter , defined in terms of the phase via eq .",
    "( [ deforder ] ) , in turn determines the behavior of the phase via eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) , which depends explicitly on @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "we then seek the stationary solution with @xmath16 being constant , which is possible due to the symmetry of the distribution of @xmath13 about zero . redefining @xmath19 as @xmath2 and suppressing indices , we write the reduced equation of motion in the form @xmath20 which depends explicitly on the magnitude @xmath18 of the order parameter .    in the absence of noise ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the self - consistency equation for the order parameter reads @xmath22 if the distribution @xmath8 is given , the collective behavior of the system can thus be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ nodrivingorder ] ) . in general the quadratic term of the order @xmath23",
    "is known to induce hysteresis in the bifurcation diagram  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it has been concluded that the non - zero inertia tends to induce hysteresis in the bifurcation diagram of the system  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistency equation for the order parameter in the presence of noise , particularly at such high temperatures that @xmath24 , has also been considered , yielding  @xcite @xmath25 with the coefficients given by the integrals @xmath26 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case collective behavior of the system has been obtained as follows : when @xmath27 , only the null solution ( @xmath28 ) is possible . at @xmath29 , on the other hand , the null solution loses its stability and the nontrivial solution @xmath30 , together with the unphysical solution @xmath31 , emerges via a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "subsequently , it grows in a continuous manner @xmath32 as @xmath33 is increased beyond @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present in detail the behavior of the order parameter with the coupling strength and the noise level . we have performed extensive numerical simulations on the equations of motion given by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) at various noise levels and coupling strengths .",
    "the order parameter @xmath18 has been computed from the definition given by eq .",
    "( [ deforder ] ) , and its behavior depending on the coupling strength and the noise level has been examined . in simulations",
    "( [ model ] ) has been integrated with discrete time steps of @xmath35 , and for convenience , a semi - circle distribution of radius @xmath36 has been chosen for @xmath8 .",
    "( we have also considered other types of distribution such as gaussian , only to find no qualitative change . ) in computing the order parameter , @xmath37 time steps have been used while the data from the first @xmath38 steps discarded at each run .",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 have been varied to confirm that the stationary state has been achieved .",
    "we have then computed the order parameter in the system of @xmath41 oscillators , each having the inertia @xmath42 .",
    "the obtained behaviors of the order parameter with the coupling strength and the noise level are displayed in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the behavior as the coupling strength @xmath33 is varied with the noise level @xmath43 kept fixed : circles and squares describe the behavior of the order parameter as the coupling strength is increased and decreased , respectively . at zero noise ( @xmath21 )",
    ", 20 independent runs have been performed with different initial configurations , over which averages are taken .",
    "the corresponding error bars have been estimated by the standard deviations whereas those data points without explicit error bars have errors smaller than the size of the symbol .",
    "note the hysteresis manifested at zero noise and weakening as the noise strength is increased from zero .",
    "these characteristic features as @xmath33 is varied for given @xmath43 agree well with the results of ref .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows that the critical coupling strength @xmath34 , beyond which synchronization sets in , increases monotonically with the noise level @xmath43 , demonstrating the suppression of synchronization by noise . here",
    "@xmath34 has been estimated by the value of the coupling strength at which the order parameter @xmath18 first becomes nonzero to the precision of @xmath44 .",
    "the circles and squares , again corresponding to the data for increasing and decreasing @xmath33 , respectively , have been obtained from averages taken over 10 independent runs with different initial configurations , and the error bars estimated by the standard deviation .",
    "thus , unlike the excitable system  @xcite , noise - induced synchronization does not emerge here .",
    "further , the hysteretic behavior , reflected by the difference in the critical coupling strength between the two cases , is revealed to diminish conspicuously as the noise level is increased .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) the behavior of the order parameter with the noise level @xmath43 for fixed coupling strength @xmath33 is displayed . here",
    "circles and squares represent the data for increasing and decreasing @xmath43 , respectively , and the typical error bars , estimated by the standard deviation obtained from @xmath45 independent runs with different initial configurations , are shown on the data points at @xmath46 .",
    "figure 2(b ) displays the detailed behavior with the noise strength for the coupling strength @xmath46 , again manifesting the hysteresis .",
    "note that the hysteresis is most conspicuous for the coupling strength around this value , decreasing as the coupling strength is increased . at weak coupling strengths ,",
    "the system is not synchronized ( @xmath47 ) , giving no hysteresis .",
    "it is thus concluded that the system exhibits quite generally hysteretic behavior as either the coupling strength or the noise level is varied , which has its origin in the non - vanishing inertia .",
    "in this section we examine the phase velocity and its power spectrum , and investigate the possibility of the noise - induced resonance .",
    "the power spectrum of the phase velocity @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fourier component of the phase velocity at frequency @xmath51 and the average over different noise realizations is also to be taken .",
    "thus @xmath52 stands for the average over the noise realizations as well as over the whole oscillators .",
    "it is related to the response function of the system via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the real part and the generalized susceptibility @xmath55 is defined to be the fourier transform of the appropriate linear - response function .",
    "when the system is disturbed by ( time - dependent ) external driving , the resulting change in the average phase velocity takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fourier component of the ( uniform ) external driving at frequency @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , the dc component of the power spectrum , describing the dc response , reads @xmath58 ^ 2         \\propto \\langle\\!\\langle { \\langle\\dot\\phi_{i}\\rangle } ^2         \\rangle\\!\\rangle , %        & = & d^2 \\langle\\!\\langle{\\langle\\dot\\phi_{i}\\rangle_t } ^2 %        \\rangle\\!\\rangle.\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the time average . in the case of a superconducting wire network or array ,",
    "the phase velocity can be identified with the voltage via the josephson relation , and the system is driven appropriately by a ( time - dependent ) external current . accordingly , eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) connects the generalized resistance with the voltage power spectrum  @xcite .    to investigate the dc component of the power spectrum",
    ", we begin with eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) and consider two types of the solution , depending on the coupling strength : in the limit of weak coupling strength , each oscillator in the system favors to oscillate with its own frequency and the system is not synchronized , yielding @xmath60 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) is then given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the initial phase velocity . taking the time average of eq .",
    "( [ poss ] ) in the stationary state ( @xmath63 ) , we obtain the mean phase velocity or the frequency of the @xmath1th oscillator , @xmath64 we now take the average over the @xmath0 oscillators ; this reduces eq .",
    "( [ timeave ] ) to @xmath65 where the symmetry of the distribution @xmath8 about @xmath66 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath67 ) has been used .",
    "on the other hand , the average of the square of the oscillator frequency , corresponding to the dc component of the power spectrum , does not vanish : @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to the variance of the distribution of @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "for example , in the simple case of the delta - function distribution @xmath72 $ ] , the variance is given by @xmath73 whereas for the semi - circle distribution with radius @xmath74 we have @xmath75 .",
    "note that in this weak - coupling limit @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 does not depend on the noise level @xmath43 , indicating the absence of the noise - induced effects .    in the limit of strong coupling strength ,",
    "the oscillators tend to oscillate in a coherent manner , displaying synchronization @xmath78 . since the order parameter @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) depends explicitly on the noise , decreasing with the noise level @xmath43 , it is expected that unlike in the weak - coupling limit @xmath79 varies with the noise level . when the noise level is sufficiently low ( @xmath80 ) in this strong - coupling limit ,",
    "the system is fully synchronized and described by the stationary solution @xmath81 which yields @xmath82 and @xmath83 . at high noise levels ( @xmath84 ) , on the other hand , the system is not synchronized ( @xmath60 ) , and we obtain @xmath85 , similarly to the case of the weak - coupling limit .",
    "accordingly , in the strong - coupling limit , @xmath86 is expected to behave with noise as follows : at low noise levels , @xmath86 increases from zero with the noise .",
    "as the noise level is raised further , it saturates eventually toward its asymptotic value , @xmath87 .",
    "note that @xmath86 just corresponds to the dispersion or mean - square displacement of the oscillator frequencies over the system since @xmath88 .",
    "its monotonic growth thus indicates suppression of frequency synchronization , which accompanies that of phase synchronization measured by the order parameter in sec .",
    "the dc susceptibility , given by @xmath89 , then grows as the noise level @xmath43 is increased from zero and diminishes with @xmath43 at high noise levels ; in between it is expected to reach its maximum . therefore in contrast with synchronization , which is suppressed by noise , response of the phase velocity to the ( uniform ) external driving can be enhanced by adding an appropriate amount of noise .    to confirm the analytical argument presented above , we have performed numerical simulations on the set of equations of motion in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we have considered the semi - circle distribution for @xmath8 , and integrates eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) with discrete time steps of @xmath90 . in computing the phase velocity , @xmath37 time steps have been used at each run , with the data from the first @xmath38 steps discarded .",
    "we have again varied both @xmath39 and @xmath40 to verify that the stationary state has been achieved , and performed 10 independent runs with different initial configurations , over which averages have been taken . in this manner",
    "we have computed @xmath86 in the system of @xmath0 oscillators , for @xmath0 up to @xmath91 , and confirmed that there are no appreciable finite - size effects for @xmath92 .",
    "figure 3 presents the obtained behavior of the dc susceptibility or the dc component of the noise - divided power spectrum with the noise level @xmath43 in the system of @xmath41 oscillators , each having the inertia @xmath42 .",
    "the semi - circle distribution of radius @xmath36 has been chosen for @xmath8 and the coupling strength @xmath93 adopted .",
    "in particular we have considered both cases of increasing and decreasing the noise level , only to obtain the same results within error bars . the behavior shown in fig .",
    "3 demonstrates that noise helps the system escape from the potential well , enhancing the response of the phase velocity to external driving .",
    "it is of interest to note that @xmath94 , at which the response becomes its maximum , is almost the same as the critical noise strength @xmath95 below which synchronization sets in [ @xmath96 for @xmath93 as shown in fig .",
    "the height of the effective potential barrier of the system described by eq .",
    "( [ single2 ] ) is given by @xmath97 .",
    "since the order parameter @xmath18 decreases with the noise level @xmath43 , the barrier height also becomes lower with @xmath43 , helping the escape from the potential well and enhancing the response to the external driving .",
    "eventually , at @xmath95 the potential barrier vanishes and the response reaches the maximum .",
    "it is thus concluded that noise not only hinders synchronization , making the critical coupling strength @xmath34 larger [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , but also enhances the response of the phase velocity to the external driving force .",
    "we now investigate the ac components of the power spectrum , i.e. , the power spectrum at nonzero frequencies , which gives the possibility of noise - induced intra - well resonance . for this purpose",
    ", we have also performed numerical simulations on the equations of motion , using the same parameter values , and compute the power spectrum of the phase velocity through the use of the fast fourier transform .",
    "the obtained power spectrum as a function of the frequency @xmath51 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . at each noise level",
    ", averages have been taken over 10 independent runs with different initial configurations , to obtain the data represented by such symbols as filled circles , empty circles , filled squares , etc . , and",
    "the error bars have been estimated by the standard deviation .",
    "note that in the absence of noise ( @xmath21 ) , no peak appears at any finite frequencies , which is natural in the system without periodic ( ac ) driving .",
    "when small noise comes into the system , however , a peak develops at a nonzero frequency ( @xmath98 in our simulation results ) and grows up with the noise , suggesting the activation of intra - well oscillation by noise .",
    "as the noise level is raised , the amplitude of such noise - induced intra - well oscillation is expected to grow , lowering its frequency .",
    "indeed the frequency at which the peak appears in fig .  4 shifts toward lower values , demonstrating the noise - induced frequency shift .",
    "it eventually approaches zero frequency ; this describes the system kicked by noise in a potential - well minimum and escaping from the minimum .",
    "namely , the intra - well oscillation induced by noise turns into the inter - well transition . to disclose the noise - induced effects in such intra - well motion ,",
    "we have also computed the generalized susceptibility at several frequencies versus the noise level , where noise - induced enhancement in the response can again be observed . in particular , at finite frequencies , it is convenient to characterize such noise - induced effects by the appropriate quality factor @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the peak height of the power spectrum , @xmath101 is the corresponding frequency , and @xmath102 is the half - width of the peak .",
    "thus the quality factor @xmath103 , given by the ratio of the peak height to the relative width , measures the degree of the coherent motion  @xcite .",
    "we have computed @xmath103 from the power spectrum obtained from 10 independent runs , taking the average at each noise level .",
    "the obtained behavior of the quality factor @xmath103 as a function of the noise level @xmath43 is shown in fig .  5 , which demonstrates the presence of the intra - well resonance induced by noise .",
    "the value @xmath104 at which @xmath103 reaches its maximum is apparently lower than that for the inter - well motion in fig .  3 , indicating that intra - well resonance can be induced by weaker noise .",
    "we have studied the synchronization phenomena and the noise - induced motion in a system of globally coupled oscillators , each possessing finite inertia , subject to constant driving force .",
    "the detailed behavior of the order parameter depending on the coupling strength and the noise level has been obtained from numerical simulations , which has revealed hysteresis both with the coupling and with the noise as well as suppression of synchronization by noise .",
    "the hysteresis with respect to the coupling is most conspicuous in the absence of noise , weakening as the noise comes into the system ; that with respect to the noise appears large at intermediate coupling strengths , diminishing with the coupling strength .",
    "we have also considered the power spectrum of the phase velocity , as the response of the system to the ( time - dependent ) external driving , and examined the possibility of the noise - induced resonance in the system .",
    "the dc component of the power spectrum , which corresponds to the dispersion of the mean oscillator frequency , has been shown to grow with noise , again manifesting suppression of synchronization .",
    "on the other hand , the noise - divided power spectrum or the generalized susceptibility , which describes the response of the phase velocity to the external driving , has been found to display a peak at a finite noise level , revealing the presence of noise - induced enhancement in the response . in particular ,",
    "the noise - induced resonance in the intra - well motion has been observed in the behavior of the quality factor with the noise strength .",
    "it is thus concluded that noise in the system of coupled oscillators not only suppresses phase synchronization but also helps the system to escape from a potential - well minimum in the response of the phase velocity , inducing the resonance .",
    "such noise - induced resonance may be manifested by a resonance peak of the voltage power spectrum in the case of a superconducting wire network .",
    "finally , we note that the major role of inertia is to bring about hysteresis in the response of the system .",
    "the inertia is in general necessary for the system to possess ( finite ) natural frequencies , and expected to be essential to the ac resonance at these finite frequencies . on the other hand",
    ", it may not be crucial in the dc resonance behavior of the power spectrum of the phase velocity in the system of coupled oscillators .",
    "preliminary results we have obtained for the case without inertia indeed indicate that the peak at zero frequency persists whereas that at finite frequency disappears , suggesting the presence of only the inter - well motion .",
    "the detailed investigation of this and other effects are left for further study .",

    "<S> we study synchronization and noise - induced resonance phenomena in systems of globally coupled oscillators , each possessing finite inertia . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the order parameter , which measures collective synchronization of the system , is investigated as the noise level and the coupling strength are varied , and hysteretic behavior is manifested . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of the phase velocity is also examined and the quality factor as well as the response function is obtained to reveal noise - induced resonance behavior . </S>"
