    "it is a challenge for both theory and experiment to understand the phase diagram of such systems . although the physics of three - body scattering can be described with different methods reaching from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory , it is difficult to account for many - body effects in thermodynamic systems with a nonzero density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 . for ultracold fermions in an optical lattice",

    "the functional renormalization group is thus a promising tool for an investigation of the many - body physics , which can be done within the same framework of truncations , simply by changing the chemical potential and the temperature .    already with the present `` vacuum computation '' we can conclude by continuity that for small temperature @xmath5 two phases with `` extended superfluidity '' are separated by a `` trion phase '' with a different symmetry .",

    "the dispersion relation for the atoms , dimers and trimers can be computed by analytical continuation , @xmath160 , of the inverse propagators to `` real frequencies '' @xmath161 . in our truncation , they read ( in terms of renormalized fields ) @xmath162 we note that the functions @xmath76 and @xmath163 depend only on the particular combinations of @xmath45 , @xmath161 , and @xmath164 given above .",

    "we also mention that the energy levels have been computed in the absence of a microscopic three - body interaction , @xmath190 . the same computation may be repeated with nonzero @xmath191 , and thus microscopic parameters may be fixed by a comparison to the experimentally measured spectrum .",
    "so far we were only concerned with the lowest energy excitation of the vacuum .",
    "we found that near a feshbach resonance this lowest excitation is given by a trimer .",
    "however , it is known from the work of efimov @xcite that one can expect not only one trimer state close to resonance but a whole spectrum .",
    "in fact , the solution @xmath192 may not be the only solution for the equation fixing the trimere energy levels , i. e. @xmath193 for an investigation of the energy dependence of @xmath163 we use the symmetry transformation and shift the chemical potential by @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "we can therefore follow the flow at vanishing @xmath196 and eq . turns into a simple implicite equation for the trion energy levels @xmath197    for @xmath198",
    "the flow equations simplify considerably .",
    "for example , eq . becomes @xmath199 we observe that the two - body sector is evaluated here for @xmath200 .",

    "an especially interesting point in the spectrum is the unitarity limit , @xmath9 , where the scattering length diverges , @xmath154 . at that point",
    "all length scales drop out of the problem and we expect a sort of scaling solution for the flow equations . in the limit @xmath203 the solution for @xmath204 is dominated completely by the term with @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and we find @xmath207 .",
    "for @xmath208 the flow equations for the three - body sector simplify and we find @xmath209 in contrast , for @xmath210 , as needed for eq . , we will have to solve the flow with a nonvanishing `` effective chemical potential ''",

    "it has to be compared with the result of other methods which find @xmath222 @xcite . considered the simplicity of our approximation , the agreement is quite reasonable .    for a determination of the trion energy levels we have to solve the flow with an effective negative chemical potential @xmath223 .",

    "we may understand the repetition of states by the following qualitative picture .",

    "the precise initial value is not important .",
    "the yukawa - type coupling @xmath102 vanishes initially so that the trion field @xmath37 is simply an auxiliary field which decouples from the other fields and is not propagating .",

    "indeed , would we consider the flow without modifying the chemical potential , this would set an infrared cutoff that stops the flow at the scale @xmath254 and the trion @xmath37 would be the gapless propagating particle while the original fermions @xmath92 and the bosons @xmath64 are gapped since they have higher energy .    following the flow further to the infrared , we find that the yukawa coupling @xmath251 decreases again until it reaches the point @xmath249 at @xmath255 ( see fig .

    "at the unitarity point with @xmath154 and at the threshold energy @xmath266 with @xmath267 , this limit cycle scaling is not stopped and leads to an infinite tower of trimer bound states .",

    "for example for negative scattering length @xmath7 and energy @xmath269 with @xmath267 , the solution of the two body sector eq . implies for the boson gap in the infrared @xmath270 so that bosonic fluctuations are suppressed in comparison to the unitarity point with @xmath154 .",
    "this leads to a stop of the limit cycle scaling at the scale @xmath271 so that the spectrum consists only of a finite number of trimer states . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : efimov ] we show the numerical result for the modified chemical potential @xmath268 of the first excited efimov trimer .",
    "our simple truncation of an exact functional renormalization group equation yields a quite detailed picture for the spectrum of bound states and the scattering of three species of identical fermions . depending on the scattering length @xmath7",
    ", the lowest energy state may be a fundamental fermion ( atom ) or a bosonic molecule ( dimer ) or even a composite fermion formed from three atoms ( trimer ) .",
    "trimers are stable ( lowest energy state ) for an interval @xmath272 which depends on the yukawa or feshbach coupling @xmath97 related to the width of the feshbach resonance .",
    "we have computed the binding energy @xmath273 of the trimer , cf .",
    "[ fig : energies ] . for @xmath274 a second trimer bound state is present , with binding energy @xmath275 .",
    "close to the resonance , we find the ( approximate ) relations @xmath276 our truncation yields @xmath277 .",
    "this structure repeats for higher @xmath4 , such that at the location of the feshbach resonance for @xmath278 an infinite tower of trimer bound states builds up .",
    "the relations , eq . , become exact for large @xmath4 , if the quantity @xmath279 is computed precisely .",
    "the origin of this repetition of self - similar features on different scales is due to a limit cycle scaling behavior of the renormalization flow .",
    "the same features appear periodically for @xmath280 , with @xmath26 the appropriate scale of the model .",
    "in other words , at the scale @xmath281 one finds the same physics as at the scale @xmath282 .",
    "this concerns all dimensionful quantities according to their dimension , e.g. @xmath283 , @xmath284 .",
    "also the three - body scattering length @xmath68 depends periodically on the logarithm of the characteristic scale @xmath26 , with an overall factor @xmath285 , cf .",
    "we have only considered the vacuum in the present paper , but we can already infer some interesting features of what happens at nonzero density for the many - body ground state at @xmath3 . the qualitative properties for small density follow from our computations by simple arguments of continuity .",
    "for small density , we find that a `` trion phase '' separates the bec phase and the bcs phase .    for increasing density , the chemical potential @xmath45 increases .",
    "the bec phase occurs for small density for @xmath286 . due to the symmetries of the microscopic action ,",
    "the effective potential for the bosonic field depends only on the @xmath287 invariant combination @xmath288 .",
    "it reads for small @xmath289 , with @xmath290 the vacuum chemical potential , @xmath291 where we use the fact that the term linear in @xmath292 vanishes for @xmath293 , i.e. @xmath294 . the minimum of the potential shows a nonzero condensate @xmath295 with density @xmath296    for the bcs phase for @xmath297 ( @xmath298 ) , one has @xmath299 .",
    "nonzero density corresponds to positive @xmath289 , and in this region the renormalization flow drives @xmath56 always to zero at some finite @xmath300 , with bcs spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @xmath301 ) induced by the flow for @xmath302 . both the bec and bcs phases are therefore characterized by superfluidity with a nonzero expectation value of the boson field @xmath303 with @xmath304 .    as an additional feature to the bcs - bec crossover for a fermi gas with two components",
    ", the expectation value for the bosonic field @xmath305 in the three component case also breaks the spin symmtry of the fermions ( su(3 ) ) . due to the analogous in qcd",
    "this was called `` color superfluidity '' @xcite . for any particular direction of @xmath305",
    "a continuous symmetry @xmath306 remains .",
    "acoording to the symmetry breaking @xmath11 , the effective potential has five flat directions .    for two identical fermions the bec and bcs phases",
    "are not separated , since in the vacuum either @xmath299 or @xmath307 .",
    "there is no phase transition , but rather a continuous crossover . for three identical fermions",
    ", however , we find a new _ trion phase _ for @xmath272 .",
    "in this region the vacuum has @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "the atom fluctuations are cut off by the negative chemical potential and do not drive @xmath56 to zero , such that for small density @xmath56 remains positive . adding a term @xmath310 to the effective potential we see that the minimum remains at @xmath311 as long as @xmath312 .",
    "no condensate of bosons occurs .",
    "the bec and bcs phases that show both extended superfluidity through a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath287 symmetry , are now separated by a phase where @xmath313 , such that the @xmath287 symmetry remains unbroken ( or will be only partially broken ) .",
    "deep in the trion phase , e.g. for very small @xmath314 , the atoms and dimers can be neglected at low density since they both have a gap .",
    "the thermodynamics at low density and temperature is determined by a single species of fermions , the trions . in our approximation",
    "it is simply given by a noninteracting fermi gas , with fermion mass @xmath315 and chemical potenial @xmath316 .",
    "beyond our approximation , we expect that trion interactions are induced by the fluctuations .",
    "while local trion interactions @xmath317 are forbidden by fermi statistics , momentum dependent interactions are allowed . these may , however , be `` irrelevant interactions '' at low density , since also the relevant momenta are small such that momentum dependent interactions will be suppressed .",
    "even if attractive interactions would induce a di - trion condensate , this has atom number six and would therefore leave a @xmath318 subgroup of the u(1 ) transformations unbroken , in contrast to the bec and bcs phase where only @xmath319 remains .",
    "furthermore , the trions are @xmath320-singlets such that the @xmath320 symmetry remains unbroken in the trion phase .",
    "the different symmetry properties between the possible condensates guarantee true quantum phase transitions in the vicinity of @xmath321 and @xmath322 for small density and @xmath3 .",
    "we expect that this phase transition also extends to small nonzero temperature .",
    "while deep in the trion phase the only relevant scales are given by the density and temperature , and possibly the trion interaction , the situation becomes more complex close to quantum phase transition points .",
    "for @xmath323 we have to deal with a system of trions and atoms , while for @xmath324 a system of trions and dimers becomes relevant .",
    "the physics of these phase transitions may be complex and rather interesting .",
    "we finally comment on the precision of our computation . at nonzero density",
    ", our truncation may be improved by including in the two - body sector a four fermion coupling @xmath325 , which may be partially bosonized in favor of a running @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "also the momentum dependence of the interactions @xmath326 or @xmath327 may be resolved beyond the pointlike approximation .",
    "furthermore we expect an improvement from including a second atom - dimer scattering channel @xmath328 , cf .",
    "these improvements are expected to change the quantitative values of @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath290 , and @xmath279 , but not the qualitative situation .",
    "we believe that already the present truncation will yield a reliable picture of the qualitative properties of the phase diagram , once it is extended to nonzero density and temperature .",
