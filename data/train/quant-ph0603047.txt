    "the observation of quantum tunneling effects is now possible in some macroscopic quantum variables such as the flux quantum transitions in a superconducting quantum interference device , or the decay of a zero - voltage state in a current - biased josephson junction @xcite .",
    "macroscopic quantum systems pertains to the boundary between quantum and classical physics .",
    "these systems are modelled by open quantum systems which are characterized by a distinguished subsystem , the `` system '' for short , interacting with an environment .",
    "the environment acts as a source of dissipation and noise for the system and produces quantum decoherence which generally inhibits tunneling @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature on this subject , see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews .",
    "most work on macroscopic quantum tunneling is based on imaginary time formalisms such as the euclidean functional techniques which have been introduced in the classical field of noise - activated escape from a metaestable state @xcite , or the instanton approach introduced for quantum mechanical tunneling or for vacuum decay in field theory @xcite .",
    "these techniques are specially suited for equilibrium or near equilibrium situations , but are difficult to generalize to non equilibrium situations .",
    "there are theoretical and practical reasons for a formalism of non equilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling . on the theoretical side dissipation as well as decoherence",
    "are only truly understood in a dynamical real time formalism . in the classical context thermal activation from metaestable states",
    "is well understood since kramers @xcite in terms of the dynamical fokker - planck transport equation , where the roles of dissipation and noise and their inter - relations are known . on the other hand",
    ", an open quantum system may be described by a dynamical equation for the reduced density matrix , the so - called master equation , or the equivalent equation for the reduced wigner function which has many similarities to the fokker - planck equation . however ,",
    "at present no compelling derivation of the tunneling rate is available in this dynamical framework , that might be compared to the instanton approach for equilibrium systems .",
    "consequently , the effect of dissipation , noise and decoherence on tunneling and their inter - connections is not yet fully understood . on the practical side out of equilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling is becoming necessary to understand arrays of josephson junctions , or time - dependent traps for cold atoms which are proposed for storing quantum information in future quantum computers @xcite , or to understand first order phase transitions in cosmology @xcite .    in recent years",
    "we have considered different scenarios in which metaestable quantum systems are described by the master equation for the reduced wigner function . by using techniques similar to those used for thermal activation processes on metastable states @xcite it was possible to compute the effect of the environment on the quantum decay probability .",
    "this was used in some semiclassical cosmological scenarios for noise induced inflation @xcite due to the back reaction of the inflaton field , in the context of stochastic semiclassical gravity @xcite ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews on this subject .",
    "it was also used for bubble nucleation in quantum field theory , where the system was described by the homogeneous mode of the field of bubble size and the environment was played by the inhomogeneous modes of the field @xcite , and on some simple open quantum systems coupled linearly to a continuum of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "but in all these problems only the contribution to tunneling due to activation was considered .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to clarify when this approximation is valid .    in this paper",
    "we propose a formulation of macroscopic quantum tunneling using the master equation for the reduced wigner function in which both the pure quantum tunneling effect and the environment are taken into account .",
    "this is possible by the introduction of a representation of the reduced wigner function based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system , _",
    "i.e. _ the system not coupled to the environment .",
    "this representation is useful in a way somewhat analogous to the way the energy representation is useful in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the key to this result is that quantum tunneling is already encoded in the energy eigenfunctions , which we can compute in a wkb approximation .",
    "it is quite remarkable that in this representation the master equation can be solved analytically under certain approximations .    in order to have a working model in a form as simple as possible , but that captures the main physics of the problem , we use constant dissipation and normal and anomalous diffusion coefficients to describe the effect of the environment .",
    "these coefficients can be deduced from microscopic physics : they take constant values when the environment is made by an ohmic distribution of harmonic oscillators weakly coupled in thermal equilibrium at high temperature ; but at zero temperature they are time dependent @xcite . thus the model studied here",
    "may be seen as a toy model at low temperature , generally valid at long time scales only .",
    "master equations play also an important role in elucidating the emergence of classicality in open quantum systems as a result of their interaction with an environment .",
    "in fact , as the master equation gives the quantum evolution of initial states , defined by the reduced wigner function at some initial time , it has been of great help to study decoherence .",
    "in particular , it has been used to clarify the way in which the environment selects a small set of states of the system which are relatively stable by this interaction , the so - called pointer states , whereas the coherent superposition of the remaining states are rapidly destroyed by decoherence @xcite . using large scale numerical simulations the effect of the interaction with the environment on coherent",
    "tunneling has been analyzed in the framework of an open quantum system that is classically chaotic : a harmonically driven quartic double well @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite tunneling in a simple double well potential has been numerically simulated using the master equation at high temperature as well as at zero temperature .",
    "it is found that at zero temperature tunneling is inhibited by the environment that produces decoherence nevertheless at large time scales tunneling is still possible by an activation - like process due to the zero point fluctuations of the quantum environment . in the model we consider in this paper , which involves a cubic potential",
    ", we find a very similar behavior when the decoherence time is very short .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next two sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] we review the theory of tunneling in closed systems and",
    "introduce the energy representation for wigner functions .",
    "this extended review is necessary both to establish our conventions and to recall specific results which are central to the main argument . in section [ oqs ]",
    "we introduce the environment and write the master equation for the reduced wigner function of the open quantum system , discuss the different dissipation and diffusion coefficients and derive the master equation in the energy representation . in section [ ab ] this master equation is explicitly computed and the different time scales of the problem are discussed . in section [ tunnel ] under the assumption of strong decoherence",
    "we analytically solve the master equation , which is reduced to a kramers - like equation , and then perturbatively compute the effect of anomalous diffusion on tunneling .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we briefly summarize our results . in the appendices we provide additional technical details .",
    "in this section we review the wkb method to tunneling in quantum mechanics .",
    "the energy eigenfunctions in the wkb approximation we obtain will play an important role in the energy representation of the wigner function that will be introduced latter .",
    "we begin with the simple closed quantum mechanical system formed by a particle of mass @xmath0 in one dimension described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 with a potential @xmath2 given by @xmath3 for small values of the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "this is a fairly general potential for a tunneling system , it is the basic element in the dashboard potential , which is a very good model for a flux trapped in a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , or a single josephson junction biased by a fixed external current @xcite . for technical reasons , it is convenient to assume that for large @xmath4 the potential flattens out and takes the value @xmath5 both negative and constant .",
    "the tunneling process ought to be independent of the form of the potential this far away from the potential barrier .",
    "we present a sketch of this potential in fig . 1 .",
    "there is one classically stable point at @xmath6 , and one unstable point @xmath7  corresponding to an energy @xmath8 .",
    "the curvature of the potential is @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11  at @xmath12 the other point at which @xmath13 is @xmath14 for @xmath15 the potential flattens out and is constant .",
    "if we assume that the particle is trapped in the potential well , that is in its false ground state or false vacuum , the tunneling probability can be computed in this simple problem in many ways .",
    "one of the most efficient is the instanton method which reduces to the computation of the `` bounce solution '' .",
    "the most attractive aspect of this computation is that it can be easily extended to field theory where the tunneling probability is then interpreted as the probability per unit time and volume to nucleate a bubble of the true vacuum phase .",
    "the rate for quantum tunneling is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the action for the `` bounce '' ( or instanton ) , namely the solution to the classical equations of motion which interpolates between @xmath6 and @xmath18 in imaginary time @xmath19 and the prefactor @xmath20 .",
    "our expression for the potential is so simple that the above integral can be computed explicitly : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the zero point energy of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath23    here , however , we will concentrate on a real time approach by expanding the false vacuum state as a linear combination of true eigenstates of the hamiltonian . to the required accuracy ,",
    "it is enough to work with the wkb approximations to the true eigenfunctions ; see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . the instanton method reviewed in the previous paragraph can ,",
    "in fact , be easily justified by this semiclassical approximation . here",
    "we explain in some detail this standard procedure to obtain the eigenfunctions by matching the wkb solutions in the different regions of the potential .",
    "these solutions will play a crucial role in the energy representation for the wigner functions to be introduced latter .",

    "we have estimated the tunneling rate for an open quantum system representing a quantum particle , trapped in a local minimum of a cubic potential , coupled to an environment .",
    "the real time formalism is based on the master equation for the reduced wigner function that describes the open quantum system .",
    "our computational method involves the introduction of an energy representation of the reduced wigner function which is based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system . the master equation in this representation , eq .",
    "( [ open5 ] ) , is an equation for some wigner function coefficients that describe the quantum correlations between eigenfunctions of different energies .    in spite of its apparent straightforwardness , the original master equation ( [ open1 ] )",
    "contains a term with three derivatives of the wigner function , which makes it quite hard to handle either analytically or numerically . from this point of view the reduction of eq .",
    "( [ open1 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ open5 ] ) , which is then approximated by eq .",
    "( [ ab9 ] ) , is already a definite step forward . also , the basic process of decoherence is hard to discern from eq .",
    "( [ open1 ] ) , while it is clearly depicted in eq .",
    "( [ ab9 ] ) .",
    "a striking feature of the decay process is that in last analysis it is robust against the details of the potential barrier .",
    "for example , the kramers activation rate is dominated by a single feature of the barrier ( its height ) , and similarly the quantum tunneling rate for the closed system .",
    "this simplicity is lost in eq .",
    "( [ open1 ] ) but regained in eq .",
    "( [ ab9 ] ) .",
    "we see that the details of the potential ( such as the height of the barrier ) enter the problem only through the boundary conditions and the phase shifts in the energy eigenfunctions .",
    "in particular , the strength of decoherence is determined by the phase shifts near the false vacuum energy , where the simple approximation of eq .",
    "( [ phase4 ] ) applies .    in our problem , where the particle is initially trapped in the false vacuum , the master equation involves a term , ( [ phase3a ] ) , that destroys the quantum correlations of the eigenfunctions and is , thus , responsible for decoherence .",
    "the strength of this term is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath345 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ tunnel5 ] ) , which is directly proportional to the energy difference between the false and true vacua . under the assumption of strong decoherence the pure quantum channel to tunneling",
    "is partially suppressed ; since decoherence destroys the fine tuning among the energy eigenfunctions that makes tunneling possible in the isolated closed system .",
    "tunneling then follows an activation - like channel due to the zero point fluctuations of the quantum environment .",
    "this is similar to the result recently found in ref .",

    "for the isolated closed system tunneling from the ground state goes through the usual quantum channel which the wkb approach or the instanton approach reproduce , and that we can equally reproduce using the energy representation of the master equation ; see section [ tiercs ] .",
    "when the system is coupled to an environment the general effect is felt as dissipation and diffusion , the latter coming as normal and anomalous diffusion .",
    "these terms will produce essentially two effects .",
    "on the one hand they will produce decoherence to the system which will tend to suppress tunneling as the system becomes more classical .",
    "on the other hand diffusion will also introduce noise into the system which will induce tunneling by a mechanism similar to thermal activation .",
    "in general all these mechanism act simultaneously and their effects can not be disentangled .",
    "when decoherence is very fast quantum tunneling is strongly suppressed and activation dominates , to leading order . in section [ oqs ]",
    "we have seen how the diffusion term , the normal diffusion and anomalous diffusion affect the linear entropy of the reduced matrix density of the open quantum system .",
    "we see clearly that normal diffusion tends to always increase the entropy and thus to induce classicalization and decoherence .",
    "this is in fact what the decoherence term ( [ phase3a ] ) in the quantum transport equation does .",
    "the fact that activation from normal diffusion becomes the dominant decay mechanism when decoherence is fast enough validates the analysis of vacuum decay in cosmology and quantum field theory given in refs .",

    "these references show how the analysis given here may be improved by a more realistic description of the bath and the system - environment interaction .",
    "we should emphasize that although the master equation in the energy representation , eq .",
    "( [ open5 ] ) , is much simpler than in the standard phase space representation , eq.([open1 ] ) , it may be difficult to go beyond the present results by analytic means .",
    "it may still be possible to treat perturbatively the symmetric but non diagonal terms in the wigner function coefficients .",
