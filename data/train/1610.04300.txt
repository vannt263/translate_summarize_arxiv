    "* theoretical context : * it has become increasingly clear that the phase diagrams of highly correlated electronic systems are inherently complex , with multiple `` intertwined '' ordering tendencies@xcite of comparable strength which sometimes appear to `` compete '' and sometimes peacefully coexist . the defining feature of such systems is that they involve a maximal degree of quantum frustration ; neither the effective kinetic nor the interaction energy is dominant .",
    "unfortunately , there are no controlled theoretical methods for solving generic `` intermediate coupling '' problems involving fermions in more than one spacial dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "a partial solution is , however , possible : density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods@xcite permit one to efficiently compute the ground - state properties of simple models , such as the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models , on ladder systems with the local geometry of any 2d lattice .",
    "long enough ladders can be treated that confident extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit in one direction is possible , although the method is limited to ladders of at most modest width . to the extent that the properties we are interested in studying are generic properties of strongly correlated systems , we may hope that the solution of simple models , even where they do not faithfully represent the actual solid state chemistry of any particular material , can teach us something useful .    with this in mind , we have used the dmrg to explore the behavior of the lightly doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the 4-leg cylinder with first and second neighbor interactions . to explore the effects of band - structure on the results , we study a range of values of the ratio of the nearest- and next - nearest neighbor hopping matrix elements , @xmath10 , while the effect of magnetic frustration is explored by varying the ratio of exchange constants , @xmath11 .",
    "since we are primarily focussing on density wave order , we report results at a fixed density of doped holes , @xmath12 , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath13 electrons per site ) where these effects are particularly pronounced .    * an empirical context : * various forms of charge - density wave ( cdw ) and spin - density wave ( sdw ) ordering tendencies have been documented in underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors ( as well as in many other interesting highly correlated materials).@xcite in some cases,@xcite as in lsco , the cdw and sdw orders appear locked to each other in that they occur in the same ranges of `` doped hole '' concentration , @xmath14 ( albeit with different onset temperatures ) and with mutually commensurate ordering vectors . in other cases,@xcite as in ybco , the cdw and sdw ordering tendencies seem to compete in that they appear ( most strongly ) in non - overlapping ranges of @xmath14 and have ordering vectors that are unrelated to one another .",
    "this dichotomy has lead some to conclude@xcite that there are two unrelated ordering tendencies in lsco and ybco , despite strong similarities in many other macroscopic signatures of these orders.@xcite    basic issues of interpretation have also arisen concerning the driving force that gives rise to these density - wave orders . from a strong coupling perspective",
    ", cdw formation can arise as a consequence of a mesoscale tendency to phase separation.@xcite density wave order might also arise from specific features of the fermi surface , including well nested portions of the fermi surface ( although the validity of this perspective with _ any _ plausible band - structure in more than one dimension has been strongly challenged@xcite ) or with putative `` hot - spots '' on the fermi surface@xcite spanned by the ordering vector associated with ( probably non - existent ) near quantum critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",

    "we see robust period 4 cdw order . for small @xmath144 , there are corresponding period 8 sdw correlations , but upon increasing @xmath144 to @xmath272 , the magnetic correlations essentially disappear .",
    "the interplay between spin and charge order can produce diverse macroscopic realizations.@xcite this observation offers a possible connection between the intertwined order in lsco , lack of substantial static spin correlations in bscco , and apparently unrelated charge and spin ordering in ybco .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the charge ordering to the degree of spin ordering apparent in our study supports the perspective that the charge density waves which have been observed across different families of underdoped cuprates have a common origin .",
    "we have studied the role of fermi surface nesting in density wave formation on the 4-leg cylinder .",
    "since nesting is perfect in 1d and problematic in higher dimensions , the cylinder geometry we have studied represents the strongest candidate for observing nesting - induced cdw .",
    "the fact that we do not find a clear relationship between @xmath203 and the values of @xmath206 suggests fermi surface nesting does not generally play a role in cdw formation .    from the strong coupling perspective",
    ", we can view the cdw-4a ( half - filled stripe ) ground state as a wigner crystal of singlet pairs which delocalize around the cylinder .",
    "the finite spin correlation length , @xmath19 , can perhaps be thought of as the size of a cooper pair , and the energy to break a pair can be associated with the single particle gap @xmath79 to add a hole to the system .      given that the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic square @xmath273 heisenberg model exhibits@xcite an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase , and possibly contains a spin liquid sub - regime , we had initially hoped to see an interesting remnant of this when we doped the system , forming a `` doped spin liquid . ''",
    "arguments were presented by anderson@xcite , and one of us@xcite that a spin - liquid can be viewed as a paired state with zero superfluid stiffness , so that upon doping it would inevitably form a strongly superconducting state .",
    "more recently , it has been proposed that a doped spin liquid might form an fl * phase , which in turn has been proposed as a candidate explanation of the physics of the pseudo - gap regime of the hole - doped cuprates.@xcite unfortunately , cdw order seems to be the dominant ordering tendency , even in the doped spin liquid range of parameters , and no evidence of either of these conjectured behaviors has yet been seen in our studies .",
    "it is an interesting feature of the cylinder geometry that a true symmetry distinction between d - wave and s - wave superconducting states is possible .",
    "the superconducting correlations in our model were shown to have @xmath7-wave symmetry across the phase diagram where charge order is present , and @xmath7-wave - like symmetry ( although this is technically s - wave symmetry with respect to rotation about the axis of the cylinder ) where charge order is absent or weak .    for moderate @xmath1 ,",
    "particles on a single plfd was supported aquette tend to pair ; we can therefore imagine a stack of plaquettes , each favoring one or two pairs where the 2-electron ground state has @xmath225-wave symmetry and the 4-electron ground state has @xmath7-wave symmetry.@xcite turning on a coupling between plaquettes , pair hopping then corresponds to a bosonic operator with @xmath7-wave symmetry which manifests in a sign change of the superconducting correlation function upon rotating the cylinder by @xmath274 .",
    "away from @xmath6 , and especially for @xmath275 , where the cdw ordering tendencies are weaker , in agreement with other studies of @xmath0-@xmath1 ladders,@xcite we observe substantially enhanced sc correlations , as we will report in a separate communication .",

    "<S> we report a density - matrix renormalization group study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with nearest ( @xmath2 & @xmath3 ) and next - nearest ( @xmath4 & @xmath5 ) interactions on a 4-leg cylinder with concentration @xmath6 of doped holes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an astonishingly complex interplay between uniform @xmath7-wave superconductivity ( sc ) and strong spin and charge density wave ordering tendencies ( sdw and cdw ) . depending on parameters , the cdws can be commensurate with period 4 or 8 . by comparing the charge ordering vectors with @xmath8 , we rule out fermi surface nesting - induced density wave order in our model . magnetic frustration ( i.e. @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> significantly quenches sdw correlations with little effect on the cdw . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the sc order is strongly modulated at the cdw ordering vector and exhibits @xmath7-wave symmetry around the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence of a near - degenerate tendency to pair - density wave ( pdw ) ordering , charge 4e sc , or orbital current order . </S>"
