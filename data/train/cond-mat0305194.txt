    "e.g. for @xmath7 this reduces to equation ( 6 ) of . using the decompositions @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , one may also write ( [ thfunfun ] ) in the form : [ thfunfun2 ] s^ ( ) & & _ rs^_r ( ) p^(r ) + & = & s_0()(p^(+)+p^(- ) ) where @xmath165 and @xmath166 act on the symmetric and antisymmetric representations occuring in the tensor product @xmath160 ; e.g. @xmath167 in @xmath168 .",
    "bound states correspond to poles of the s - matrix , with masses [ boundstatemass ] m_b = . since @xmath169 is free of zeros , and exhibits simple poles at @xmath170,@xcite it follows that ( [ thfunfun2 ] ) has a single simple pole at @xmath171 occuring within the physical strip , @xmath172 .",
    "this yields the bound state mass of the second fundamental particle , @xmath173 , as given by equation ( [ massfun ] )",
    ".    the s - matrix describing the scattering of a ( rank-1 ) fundamental particle off its conjugate ( rank-@xmath6 ) may be obtained from ( [ thfunfun2 ] ) by the crossing transformation : ^()=c _ s^(i-)c _ where @xmath174 is the conjugation operator on @xmath153 .",

    "in particular , for @xmath7 , ( [ thfunfun2 ] ) and ( [ thfuncon2 ] ) coincide ( up to sign ) as expected from the identification of @xmath153 and @xmath59 in @xmath181 . moreover , equation ( [ thfunfun2 ] ) is also in agreement with equation ( 1.6a ) of reference .",
    "the s - matrix ( [ thfuncon2 ] ) has a pole at @xmath182 occuring within the physical strip , @xmath172 .",

    "such matrix elements are termed _",
    "form factors _ , and their computation is an important enterprise ; see for example . as is discussed in ch . 1 of smirnov s book,@xcite the two - particle form factors [ 2pffdef ] f_o(_1,_2)__1,_20|o(0,0)|_2_1__2,_1 satisfy a matrix ( riemann  hilbert ) problem , also known as watson s equations : f(_1,_2 + 2i)__1,_2=f(_1,_2)__1^,_2^s__1,_2^_1^,_2^(_12 ) .",
    "this equation may be diagonalized to yield the simpler scalar problem(s ) [ scalarrh ] f(_1,_2 + 2i)=f(_1,_2)s(_12 ) , where @xmath187 are the s - matrix eigenvalues . in particular , the thirring current operator @xmath188 ( with @xmath189 components ) couples to the adjoint representation occuring in the tensor product @xmath60 ; the relevant eigenvalue is [ sj ] s()^|_adj()=-s_1 ( ) .",
    "another constraint on the form factors comes form lorentz invariance . under a lorentz boost",
    ", corresponding to a simultaneous shift of all rapidities by @xmath190 , the two - particle form factor of an operator @xmath191 of spin @xmath108 satisfies : f_o(_1+,_2+)=e^sf_o(_1,_2 ) .",
    "in particular , the left ( right ) component of the thirring current has spin @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) and one obtains : f_j_l^a(_1,_2)e^+(_1+_2)/2f^_adj(_12 ) , + f_j_r^a(_1,_2)e^-(_1+_2)/2f^_adj(_12 ) .",
    "note that @xmath194 is a function of @xmath195 , and is thus lorentz invariant .",
    "the form factors corresponding to the temporal and spatial components of the current may be written : [ temporal ] f_j_0^a(_1,_2)m()f^_adj(_12 ) , + [ spatial ] f_j_1^a(_1,_2)m()f^_adj(_12 ) . substituting ( [ sj ] ) and either of ( [ temporal ] ) and ( [ spatial ] ) into ( [ scalarrh ] ) , one obtains a constraint on @xmath196 : [ lirh ] f^|_adj(-2i)=f^|_adj()s_1 ( ) . following the general arguments of karowski and weisz @xcite ( equations 2.18 and 2.19 ) equation ( [ lirh ] )",
