    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) has been considered for many systems dating back to the classic paper of ritchie@xcite on surface plasmons for a slab of dielectric material in the local limit and subsequently generalized to a non - local dielectric function by gumbs and horing.@xcite the non - locality was included in ref . through the screening of the electron - electron interaction produced by single - particle excitations and plasmon modes .",
    "fessatidis , et al.@xcite recently adopted the formalism of horing , et al.@xcite for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and gumbs and balassis@xcite for a nanotube to graphene with the aid of the polarization function calculated by wunsch , et al.@xcite for conventional dirac electrons .",
    "there have been several recent papers which considered the effects which a circularly polarized electromagnetic field ( cpef),@xcite spin - orbit interaction ( soi)@xcite in suspended graphene or the sublattice symmetry breaking ( ssb ) by an underlying polar substrate@xcite in epitaxial graphene may have on the energy band structure and plasma excitations@xcite of a graphene sheet . under these conditions",
    ", there is a gap between the valence and conduction bands as well as between the intra - band and inter - band electron - hole continuum of the otherwise semimetallic dirac system.@xcite additionally , the interplay between the single - particle excitations in the long wavelength limit results in dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction which produces an undamped plasmon mode that appears in the gap separating the two types of electron - hole modes forming a continuum . by this",
    "we mean that a self - sustained collective plasma mode is not supported by exciting _",
    "either _ the intra - band or inter - band single - particle modes only . furthermore ,",
    "since the dirac electrons now acquire a non - zero effective mass , one can produce a long wavelength plasmon mode as in the 2deg by intra - band excitations only .",
    "these properties of the plasma modes give rise to noticeable differences in the behavior of the stopping power of gapped graphene compared with conventional free - standing exfoliated multilayer graphene .",
    "multi - layer epitaxially grown graphene ( mlg ) may become a valuable and relatively cheap alternative to rather expensive exfoliated graphene .",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments unambiguously demonstrated almost perfect dirac cones on most of the layers .",
    "that is the electrons in the layers behave as if the layers are uncoupled in contrast to bernal stacking in bi - layer graphene.@xcite although some layers may establish bi - layer structures the interaction between the first and the buffer layer ( the one sitting on top of the sic substrate ) is always weak.@xcite the spectral function of mlg on sic substrate suggests the energy gap of few hundreds of @xmath0 .",
    "however the exact gap opening mechanism in epitaxial graphene is still under debate.@xcite the complexity comes from the fact that the graphene sample sits on top of a buffer layer which provides an additional mid gap level , thus obscuring the exact energy dispersion curve and requires numerical _ ab initio _",
    "calculations.@xcite in addition , the dos around fermi energy failed to indicate the gap.@xcite this ambiguity stimulated discussion regarding the symmetry breaking gap@xcite versus the effects due to electron - electron interaction.@xcite this also indicates the importance of alternative techniques capable of identifying the induced gap by a buffer layer on a substrate .",
    "eels may be employed to ascertain the plasmon frequencies in single and double layer graphene .",
    "the raman shift of the scattered electrons provides both particle - hole and plasmon excitation frequencies , which are usually characterized by their spectral weight , a quantity that depends on the transferred energy @xmath1 and in - plane momentum @xmath2 .",
    "this allows mapping of the plasmon dispersions @xmath3.@xcite here we calculate eels spectra in order to pinpoint the effect of the substrate induced gap in mlg .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] , we derive the energy loss for charged particles incident on multiple electron layers at an arbitrary angle of incidence . in sec.[sec:3 ] , this formalism is applied to mlg with a gapped buffer layer .",
    "our numerical simulations are compared with experimental results of lu and loh@xcite in sec.[sec:4 ] .",

    "we shall consider an inhomogeneous medium ( in the @xmath4 direction ) described by a nonlocal dielectric function @xmath5 . here , we have introduced space - time points , such as @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 spacial coordinate has been separated out due to the inhomogeneity and making cylindrical coordinates suitable for our discussion .",
    "our focus is the calculation of energy loss of a charged particle @xmath8 moving along a prescribed trajectory @xmath9 . due to non - locality of the dielectric function ,",

    "and then into , we obtain the components of the frictional force as    @xmath12    we assume that the particle trajectory begins at @xmath13 and ends at @xmath14 with its motion in vacuum . the net energy lost due to the frictional force between it and the plasma during this motion",
    "may be expressed as    @xmath15    it is convenient to partition the loss as @xmath16 . the energy loss due to parallel and perpendicular motions may be written as    @xmath17    in eq . ,",
    "integration by parts was carried out , along with the condition that the charged particle starts and ends in vacuum : @xmath18 .",
    "the above general expressions can be simplified further , for the practically important cases of parallel , perpendicular and traversing motion .",
    "first , we assume that the charged particle travels parallel to the @xmath20 plane with velocity component @xmath21 . in this case , to simplify eq . , we can use the following identities :    @xmath22    in the above eq .",

    "the rate of the energy loss expressed per unit length is usually referred to as the stopping power @xmath26 .",
    "now , let us assume that the particle has only velocity component perpendicular to the @xmath20 plane , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "we shall focus on the last integration in eq .",
    ", by changing the variable @xmath29 , so that we can perform the series string of simplifications on it , namely ,    @xmath30    consequently , by combining eqs . and , we obtain the following energy loss in the perpendicular case as    @xmath31    now , let us apply the energy loss formalism to single and double layers of of epitaxially grown graphene . the epitaxial form of graphene usually features the energy gap , which may be controlled by an external electric field from a gate .      for the case",
    "when the charged particle crosses the layers , none of the components of the velocity is zero .",
    "as in the perpendicular case , the initial position of the particle is of little importance and we may change variable @xmath32 in eq .",
    ", followed by adding the obtained equation to eq . , giving    @xmath33    the last expression is obtained by changing the sign @xmath34 and utilizing the symmetry relation eq .. we now rewrite the energy loss via the energy - loss probability spectral function @xmath35 . to do so , we introduce @xmath36 , thereby obtaining    @xmath37    an alternative derivation of the above equation is provided in appendix[ap:1 ] .",
    "one may show in a straightforward way that the above general expression may be expressed as eq . in the case of @xmath27 .",
    "the other limiting case eq .",
    "is less trivial .",
    "it is obtained from eq . by taking the following limits @xmath38 , @xmath39 and using eq ..    it is straightforward to derive the energy loss when the charged particle is elastically reflected from the si surface ( at @xmath40 ) of the sic substrate , yielding    @xmath41    for multiple graphene layers separated by distance @xmath42 , we can assume wave function localization on the layers , and neglect their overlap . therefore , we obtain@xcite    @xmath43    where the 2d fourier transform of the coulomb interaction has been introduced by @xmath44 with @xmath45 for background dielectric constant @xmath46 . the arguments @xmath47 of the noninteracting polarization function @xmath48 on the @xmath49 layer have been omitted .",

    ", with and simulate the energy loss for two distinct cases , namely when the charged particle motion is parallel and perpendicular to the graphene layers .",
    "we begin our discussion with the energy loss rates in eq . for single and symmetric double layer configurations .",
    "our energy loss results for charged particle motion parallel to the surface are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the separation between the two layers was chosen as @xmath93 .",
    "the charged particle travels above the graphene surface at a height @xmath94 .",
    "all frequencies were analytically continued to the complex plane and acquire a small positive loss rate @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "we notice that the plasmon contribution becomes smaller with increasing energy gap @xmath70 .",
    "this can be easily attributed to decreasing plasmon drude factor @xmath97 .",
    "the contribution from the particle - hole modes is largely unaffected by the gap . in the double layer configuration ,",
    "a small spike at the beginning of the plasmon contribution region is due to the two branches . both undamped",
    "optical and acoustic plasmon branches contribute .",
    "however , with increased particle velocity , only the optical branch contributes , as it is demonstrated in fig.[fig:2 ] . since the spectral weight of the optical branch is larger than that of the acoustic branch , we see that the spike appears .",
    "we note that one can obtain a closed - form analytic expression for the loss rate if we include only the long wavelength plasmon contributions.@xcite in any event , this must be the leading contribution for small and moderate particle velocities @xmath98 , because of the @xmath99 factor .",
    "we now consider a single , free - standing @xmath100 and double - layer graphene and present results for the energy loss spectra of a charged particle moving perpendicular to the graphene surface . by symmetry , the transmission and reflection spectra from the single layer must be identical .",
    "the transmission spectra are shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "the energy loss was calculated using either the full version of the noninteracting polarization function in the rpa shown in fig.[fig:3](a ) , or its long - wavelength plasmon pole approximation [ eqs . and ] as seen in fig.[fig:3](b ) .",
    "one may classify three different scattering regimes depending on the charged particle velocity @xmath101 .",
    "in the low - velocity regime , as shown in column ( 1 ) of fig.[fig:3 ] for single and double layers , the particle - hole excitations dominate the scattering . there is an absorption spike due to the landau damped plasmon mode which separates the particle - hole continuum from the undamped plasmon modes as shown in fig.[fig:2](a ) .",
    "the strength of the spike diminishes with increased charged particle speed .",
    "the position of such resonance absorption at @xmath102 is independent of @xmath103 , indicating the effect due to linear dispersion of the damped plasmon branch . in the intermediate velocity regime given in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of fig.[fig:3 ] ,",
    "the damped and undamped plasmon mode contributions are comparable . however , in the high - velocity limit , shown in columns ( 4 ) of fig.[fig:3 ] , the undamped plasmons dominate the spectra . in that regime",
    ", one can employ the polarization in its long wave limit to a good approximation , as we can see in fig.[fig:3](b ) .",
    "the approximation works for both the single and double - layer configuration . in the work of allison ,",
    "et al.,@xcite an attempt was made to compensate for the red shift of the absorption maximum by introducing a restoring force in the electron liquid .",
    "however , the origin of this restoring force was not clear .",
    "additionally , the approximation introduced in their work does not yield results which converge on those when the rpa polarization for graphene is employed .",
    "another observation is that the double layer just doubles the absorption of the single layer , without any perceptible spectral shift .",
    "this is a consequence of large interlayer distance .",
    "when the layers are closely packed the absorption peak is blue shifted with increasing number of layers , in agreement with ref .    in fig.[fig:4 ]",
    ", we present the transmission and reflection spectra for epitaxial mlg .",
    "the zeroth layer only acquires the energy gap .",
    "this gap increases in columns ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) .",
    "our principal observation is that in the intermediate velocity regime , given by columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in fig.[fig:4 ] , the absorption spectrum splits into two peaks .",
    "the one identified with the damped plasmon peak ( @xmath104 ) comes from the upper graphene layer for which @xmath79 .",
    "the other peak may be attributed to the symmetry - broken zeroth layer absorption ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we note that in the high velocity limit , shown in column ( 4 ) of fig.[fig:4 ] , the gap results in a red shift of the absorption maximum .",
    "the small splitting of the peak is also visible on the damped plasmon contribution . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the layers are so far apart that one can not identify a plasmon mode as the acoustic branch .",
    "the reflection spectrum qualitatively mimics the transmitted spectrum , but doubles in height .",
    "this is because the charged particle spends twice as much time in between the layers compared to the transmissive case .",
    "of course , the particle expends most of its energy on this part of the trajectory .    to see the acoustic branch ( fig.[fig:2](b ) ) in the spectra , we vary intralayer distance in ( rows ( a ) through ( c ) of fig.[fig:5 ] . for all velocity regimes [ panels ( 1)-(4 ) ] .",
    "several values of the gap are also shown on the graph .",
    "the low - frequency acoustic branch boosts the long wavelength absorption ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this is especially so for small energy gap , since the separation between the branches is well pronounced [ fig.[fig:2](b ) ] . in the high velocity regime or",
    "result os small interlayer separation [ fig.[fig:5 ] ( a.4 ) ] ore result is qualitatively similar to fig.3 of ref .. with increasing angle of incidence @xmath107 the sharp peak of the particle hole absorption becomes less pronounced and finally reaches . ]",
    "the smooth curve as in fig.[fig:1](a.1- a.4 ) .",
    "the plasmon peak is blue shifted with @xmath108 finally reaching those of fig.[fig:1](a.5 ) . since the plasmon momentum is proportional to @xmath108 one can interpret this blue shift as the raman shift due to plasmon activation . ) of ref.22",
    "confirms that the plasmon momentum @xmath109 is proportional to the sine of the incidence angle . ]",
    "given its linear nature we deuce that for small interlayer distance mostly acoustic plasmon branch is activated , thus explaining fig.2(d ) of ref .. this interpretation is further confirmed by the comparison with the large interlayer separation raman shift , which follows @xmath110 pattern . unfortunately , as it follows from fig.[fig:2](b ) , it is hard to deduce existence of the gap from the acoustic plasmon branch . experimentally one would have to transfer mlg onto a non - polar substrate and observe the increase in the plasmon slope if the gap was originally present .    comparing the plasmon absorption in the parallel and perpendicular cases ,",
    "the plasmons contribute more to the former in the low - velocity regime , whereas in the latter case , their contribution is most pronounced for higher incoming charged particle velocities .",
    "we have investigated the role played by a gap in the energy dispersion on the absorption spectra of single and double layer configurations .",
    "all velocity regimes for the external charged particle moving perpendicular to the graphene surface were reported in figs.[fig:3],[fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the plasmon pole approximation for the polarization agrees well with the results obtained with the full polarization in the rpa in the high - velocity regime only .",
    "the speed of the external charged particle determines whether the plasmon or particle - hole excitations dominate the scattering .",
    "consequently , since gapped graphene has a different plasma excitation spectrum than free - standing graphene , its stopping power may carry distinct signatures of the substrate induced gap .",
    "we also demonstrated that our formalism can qualitatively describe experimental data of ells .",
    "it also allowed us to interpret the observed linear plasmon dispersion as coming from the acoustical undamped branch .",
