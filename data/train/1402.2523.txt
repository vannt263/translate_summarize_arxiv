    "signals having the power spectral density ( psd ) at low frequencies @xmath1 of the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 close to @xmath4 are commonly referred to as `` @xmath0 noise '' , `` @xmath0 fluctuations '' , or `` flicker noise .",
    "'' power - law distributions of spectra of signals with @xmath5 , as well as scaling behavior are ubiquitous in physics and in many other fields @xcite . despite the numerous models and theories proposed since its discovery more than 80 years ago @xcite , the subject of @xmath0 noise remains still open for new discoveries .",
    "most models and theories of @xmath0 noise are not universal because of the assumptions specific to the problem under consideration . a short categorization of the theories and models of @xmath0 noise is presented in the introduction of the paper @xcite .",
    "see also recent experimental investigations and physical models of @xmath0 noise in condensed matter @xcite and a review by balandin @xcite .",
    "often @xmath0 noise is modeled as the superposition of lorentzian spectra with a wide range distribution of relaxation times @xcite .",
    "an influential class of the models of @xmath0 noise involves self - organized criticality ( soc ) . in 1987",
    "et al _ @xcite introduced the notion of soc with the motivation to explain the universality of @xmath0 noise .",
    "although paper @xcite is the most cited paper in the field of @xmath0 noise problems , it was shown later on @xcite that the mechanism proposed in @xcite results in @xmath6 fluctuations with @xmath7 and does not explain the omnipresence of @xmath0 noise .",
    "the @xmath0 noise in the fluctuations of mass was first seen in a sandpile model with threshold dissipation by ali @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied a one - dimensional directed model of sandpiles and showed that the exponent @xmath3 is exactly @xmath4 for noise in the spectrum of fluctuations of mass .",
    "an example of @xmath0 noise in the classical sandpile model has been provided in @xcite .",
    "another models of @xmath0 noise involve a class of maps generating intermittent signals .",
    "it is possible to generate power - laws and @xmath0-noise from simple iterative maps by fine - tuning the parameters of the system at the edge of chaos @xcite where the sensitivity to initial conditions of the logistic map is a lot milder than in the chaotic regime @xcite .",
    "manneville @xcite showed that iterative function can produce interesting behavior , power - laws and @xmath0 psd . in paper",
    "@xcite a mechanism of intermittency exhibiting @xmath0 noise which occurs in nonlinear dynamical systems with invariant subspace and having the transverse lyapunov exponent equal to zero was considered .",
    "intermittency as a mechanism of @xmath0 noise continues to attract attention @xcite .    in many cases the physical processes",
    "can be represented by a sequence of random pulses .",
    "the mathematical way of generating power - law noise from a sequence of pulse has been discussed by halford @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the signal consisting of the pulse sequences which belong to the class of markov process , was investigated in @xcite . in those models",
    "the power - law psd appears due to power - law distribution of pulse durations .",
    "main objection to this approach is an apparent lack of physical mechanism generating durations over several orders of magnitude @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we can point out that the diffusion process gives rise to broad distributions of lifetimes .",
    "it is known that for the unbiased random walk , the distribution of the first return times has a power - law form with the exponent @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism leading to broad distribution of lifetimes is owing to the formation of avalanches . in many situations ( for example in barkhausen noise @xcite ,",
    "fluid invasion into disordered media @xcite , dislocation avalanches in microcrystals @xcite ) the volume of avalanches has power - law distribution and , in addition , the volume scales as a power - law function of the duration of the avalanche .",
    "similar properties have also avalanches in the models of soc @xcite .    one more way of obtaining @xmath0 noise from a signal consisting of pulses has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the intrinsic origin of @xmath0 noise may be a brownian motion of the interevent time of the signal pulses , similar to the brownian fluctuations of the signal amplitude , resulting in @xmath9 noise .",
    "recently , the nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) generating signals with @xmath0 noise were obtained in @xcite ( see also papers @xcite ) , starting from the point process model of @xmath0 noise .",
    "analysis of the long - range correlated bursting signals is presented in @xcite , as well .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show the connection between the nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath0 noise and signals consisting of random pulses with the power - law distribution of pulse durations .",
    "as we will demonstrate , in both of these models @xmath0 spectrum appears due to the scaling properties of the signal .",
    "in addition , the signal generated by sde can be approximated by rectangular pulses yielding the same distribution of signal intensity and the same power - law exponent in the psd .",
    "although the models generating @xmath0 noise that we consider in this paper ( nonlinear sdes and random pulses with the power - law distribution of pulse durations ) are not unique , the method of their derivation from the scaling properties of the signal was not investigated before .",
    "we obtain nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath0 noise starting _ not _ from the point process model , as has been done in @xcite , but _ from the scaling properties of the signal required to get @xmath0 noise_. this approach allows us to reveal new connections between those seemingly different models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we consider nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath6 psd and show that such sdes can be obtained by requiring a proper scaling . in",
    "we analyze signals consisting of random pulses with the power - law distribution of pulse durations and power - law dependence of pulse height on the pulse duration .",
    "we show that such pulses have the same scaling properties as the signal generated by sdes in . in",
    "we produce the connection between the nonlinear sdes modeling and the rectangular pulses series more explicitly .",
    "summarizes our findings .",
    "nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath6 psd are derived in papers @xcite . in this section",
    "we show these sdes can be obtained only from the scaling properties required by @xmath6 psd .",
    "this new technique reveals more directly the origin of @xmath6 psd compared to the derivation starting from the point process model , as has been done in @xcite .",
    "pure @xmath6 psd is physically impossible because the total power would be infinite .",
    "therefore , we will consider signals with psd having @xmath6 behavior only in some wide intermediate region of frequencies , @xmath10 , whereas for small frequencies @xmath11 psd is bounded .",
    "we can obtain nonlinear sde generating signals exhibiting @xmath0 noise using the following considerations .",
    "wiener - khintchine theorem relates psd @xmath12 to the autocorrelation function @xmath13 : @xmath14 if @xmath15 in a wide region of frequencies , then for the frequencies in this region the psd has a scaling property @xmath16 when the influence of the limiting frequencies @xmath17 an @xmath18 is neglected . from the wiener - khintchine theorem",
    "it follows that the autocorrelation function has the scaling property @xmath19 in the time range @xmath20 .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be written as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the steady state probability density function ( pdf ) and @xmath23 is the transition probability ( the conditional probability that at time @xmath24 the signal has value @xmath25 with the condition that at time @xmath26 the signal had the value @xmath27 ) . the transition probability can be obtained from the solution of the fokker - planck equation with the initial condition @xmath28 .",
    "one of the ways to obtain the required property is for the steady state pdf to have the power - law form @xmath29 and for the transition probability to have the scaling property @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scaling exponent , the meaning of which will be revealed below , equation . indeed , from equations  and a change of variables it follows @xmath32    thus , the autocorrelation function has the required property with @xmath3 given by equation @xmath33 note , that according to equation the change of the magnitude of the stochastic variable @xmath34 is equivalent to the change of time scale @xmath35 .    in order to avoid the divergence of steady state pdf the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath27 should be restricted at least from the side of small values and , therefore , holds only in some region of the variable @xmath27 , @xmath36 . when the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath27 is restricted , equation also can not be exact",
    "however , if the influence of the limiting values @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be neglected for time @xmath24 in some region @xmath39 , we can expect that the scaling approximately holds in this time region .    to get the required scaling of the transition probability",
    ", the sde should contain only powers of the stochastic variable @xmath27 .",
    "this will be the case if the coefficient in the noise term is the power - law depending , i.e. , proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the drift term then is fixed by the requirement for the steady state pdf .",
    "thus we consider sde @xcite @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a standard wiener process ( the brownian motion ) and @xmath43 is the white noise intensity .",
    "note that sde is the same as in papers @xcite , only here we obtained it from the consideration of the scaling properties , not starting from the point process model .",
    "changing the variable @xmath27 in to the scaled variable @xmath44 or introducing the scaled time @xmath45 and using the property of the wiener process @xmath46 one gets the same resulting equation .",
    "thus , change of the scale of the variable @xmath27 and change of time scale are equivalent , as in equation , and the exponent @xmath31 is @xmath47 from equation it follows that the power - law exponent in the psd of the signal generated by sde is @xmath48    in order to obtain a stationary process and avoid the divergence of steady state pdf the diffusion of stochastic variable @xmath27 should be restricted or equation should be modified .",
    "the simplest choice of the restriction is the reflective boundary conditions at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "another choice would be modification of equation to get rapidly decreasing steady state pdf when the stochastic variable @xmath27 acquires values outside of the interval @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "for example , the steady state pdf @xmath52 with @xmath53 has a power - law form when @xmath36 and exponential cut - offs when @xmath27 is outside of the interval @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "such exponentially restricted diffusion is generated by the sde @xmath54x^{2\\eta-1}\\rmd t + \\sigma x^{\\eta}\\rmd w_t\\label{eq : sde - restricted}\\ ] ] obtained from equation by introducing additional terms in the drift .",
    "the presence of the restrictions at @xmath49 and @xmath50 makes the scaling not exact and this limits the power - law part of the psd to a finite range of frequencies @xmath10 .",
    "let us estimate the limiting frequencies .",
    "taking into account the limiting values @xmath37 and @xmath38 , equation for the transition probability corresponding to sde becomes @xmath55 here @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the parameters of the transition probability .",
    "the steady state distribution @xmath56 has the scaling property @xmath57 inserting equations and into equation we obtain @xmath58 this equation means that time @xmath24 in the autocorrelation function should enter only in combinations with the limiting values , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we can expect that the influence of the limiting values can be neglected and the scaling holds when the first combination is small and the second large , that is when time @xmath24 is in the interval @xmath61 .",
    "then , using equation the frequency range where the psd has @xmath6 behavior can be estimated as @xmath62 however , numerical solutions of proposed nonlinear sdes show that this estimation is too broad , i.e. , the numerically obtained frequency region with the power - law behavior of psd is narrower than according to equation .",
    "note , that for @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 the width of the frequency region is zero , and we do not have @xmath6 power spectral density .     and @xmath38 .",

    "for the numerical solution we use the euler - maruyama approximation , transforming the differential equations to difference equations .",
    "we can use constant time step , however at large values of @xmath27 the coefficients in the equations become large and thus require a very small time step .",
    "more effective method of solution is to use a variable time step , decreasing with the increase of @xmath27 . as in @xcite",
    "we choose the time step in such a way that the coefficient before noise becomes proportional to the first power of @xmath27 .",

    "the width of this region can be increased by increasing the ratio between the minimum and the maximum values of the stochastic variable @xmath27 .",
    "as we see in figure  [ fig : sde]a , the numerical calculations exhibit a structure of the signal consisting of peaks or bursts .",
    "analysis @xcite reveals that the sizes of the bursts are approximately proportional to the squared durations of the bursts with the power - law distributions of the bursts durations and interburst time .",
    "the exponent of the pdf of the interburst time approximately equal to @xmath8 has been obtained numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider pulse sequences with independent pulses .",
    "the shapes of the pulses are characterized by an arbitrary large set of parameters @xmath76 , whereas the occurrence times of the pulses are described by a set of time moments @xmath77 .",
    "the general form of the signal can be written as @xmath78 where functions @xmath79 determine the shape of individual pulses .",
    "the pulse duration @xmath80 is included in the set of parameters @xmath76 or , more generally , is a function of the parameters , @xmath81 .",
    "inter - pulse duration is @xmath82 .",
    "such a pulse sequence is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : pulses ] .",
    "we assume that : ( i ) the pulse sequences are stationary and ergodic ; ( ii ) parameters @xmath76 of different pulses are independent ; ( iii ) all pulses are described by the same function @xmath79 ; ( iv ) the pulse parameters @xmath76 have the distribution @xmath83 .",
    "the easies way to calculate psd of a pulse sequence is to start from the definition of the power spectral density directly @xcite .",
    "however , in order to demonstrate connection with the previous section we will consider the expression for the autocorrelation function of the signal .",
    "the autocorrelation function is given by the equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 the observation time interval and the brackets @xmath86 denote averaging over realizations of the pulse sequence . using the signal we can write @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of pulses during the observation time interval @xmath85 .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be decomposed into two parts , the first part containing the autocorrelation of each pulse with itself and the second part containing all cross terms : @xmath89 in many cases @xmath6 psd is caused only by the first part .",
    "for example , it is known that when the pulses occur randomly as a poisson process , the psd of the signal depends only on the shapes of the pulses , as given by carson s theorem @xcite .",
    "conditions when a sequence of randomly occurring pulses leads to @xmath6 noise were investigated in @xcite .",
    "note , that when inter - pulse duration @xmath82 is uncorrelated with the duration of the pulse , different pulses may be overlapping . even in case when the other terms in equation are nonzero ,",
    "the first part can have different dependence on time @xmath24 and dominate for some time range @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , initially we will consider only the first part of equation .",
    "it can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mean number of pulses per unit time .",

    "note , that the scaling in equation is the same as described by equation  ( 9 ) in @xcite , where the pulse area @xmath101 is used instead of pulse duration @xmath80 .    in order to avoid the divergence of the pdf of pulse durations",
    ", equation should hold only in some region of the pulse durations @xmath80 , @xmath102 . in this case",
    "the scaling can not be exact .",
    "however , if the influence of the limiting values @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be neglected for time @xmath24 in some region @xmath39 , we can expect that the scaling approximately holds for this time region .",
    "one of the ways to get the required scaling of the autocorrelation function @xmath105 is to consider pulses having the same shape , only stretched in height and in time .",
    "the signal consisting of such pulses was investigated in @xcite . for stretched pulses we can write @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the height of the pulse .",
    "the function @xmath108 is nonzero only when @xmath109 .    from equation",
    "we obtain @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mean squared amplitude of pulses having the same duration @xmath94 and the function @xmath112 is the autocorrelation function of pulse shapes .",
    "if the height @xmath113 of the pulse is a power - law function of the pulse duration @xmath80 , @xmath114 then the scaling of the autocorrelation function holds .",
    "it should be noted , that even when pulse height @xmath113 is proportional to @xmath115 , the coefficient of proportionality is not necessarily constant .",
    "in particular , the sign of the pulses can be random .",
    "only coefficient of proportionality for the average of the square of the pulse height @xmath116 should be constant .",
    "if pulse height is a power - law function of the pulse duration , then the change of the magnitude of the pulse height @xmath117 is caused by the change of pulse duration @xmath118 . comparing this scaling property to equation",
    "we see that the power - law exponent @xmath100 plays a similar role as @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 the sign minus in equation appears because stretching the time , as in equation , is equivalent to the shortening of the pulse duration .",

    "@xmath123 we can write the autocorrelation function , according to equations and , as @xmath124 according to paper @xcite , physically reasonable pulses are square - integrable and have everywhere finite derivative of the autocovariance function with respect to time . then for large @xmath125 we can approximate @xmath126 and get @xmath127\\ , , & $ 0<\\beta<1 $ , \\\\",
