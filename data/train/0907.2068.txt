    "accretion disks are widely appreciated to be a powerful source of emission from gas or plasma orbiting central stars or compact objects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to explain the rapid variability and short lifetimes of accreting systems without unphysical mass densities , some enhanced angular momentum transport beyond that which can be supplied by the microphysical transport coefficients is typically required @xcite .",
    "many accreting sources show jets , outflows , and active coronae highlighting that disk dynamics and energy release involves some combination of local and large scale transport . understanding the relative balance between the two is of fundamental importance .    in some disk models ,",
    "the primary angular momentum transport and dissipation takes place above the disk ( lynden - bell 1969 ; field and rogers 1993 ) and the turbulence within the disk itself plays a secondary role .",
    "however , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) has emerged as a likely source of turbulence within accretion disks , and a leading candidate to contribute local turbulent angular momentum transport in sufficiently ionized disks @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite have revealed that the nonlinear evolution of systems unstable to the mri leads to sustained mhd turbulence and outward angular momentum transport .    understanding the saturation of the mri is currently a topic of active research ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "local shearing box simulations have not converged to practical angular momentum transport coefficients , which are found to depend strongly on the simulation box size and the initial seed magnetic field ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the magnetic prandtl number @xcite . an important frontier in this regard",
    "is to understand the development and role of large scale magnetic field structures in the saturation of mri - driven turbulence @xcite and , more generally , in the process of angular momentum transport . a realistic disk likely involves coupled internal and coronal dynamics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , the relevance of large scale magnetic fields in accretion disks is strongly motivated by the interpretation of x - ray flux in seyferts which has been best interpreted as coronal emission .",
    "the flux from 1 - 500 kev ranges from 10 to 50 per cent of the total flux ( mushotzky et al . 1993 ) . galactic black hole x - ray sources show both thermal and non - thermal ( power law ) spectral components , with the ratio of non - thermal to total luminosity ranging between 20 and 40 per cent ( nowak 1995 ) .",
    "the leading paradigm for x - ray emission in these accreting systems involves an optically thin , hot corona powered by magnetic field dissipation ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1993 : field & rogers 1993 ) . if the corona results from magnetic structures dissipating above the disk midplane that were originally produced within the turbulent disk ( e.g. , via magnetic instabilities , such as the mri ) , then these structures must be of large enough scale to survive the buoyant rise without being prematurely shredded by disk turbulence .",
    "if all coronal and jet emission results from fields initially produced within a turbulent disk , then the fraction of coronal to bolometric luminosity is directly related to the fraction of magnetic energy associated with buoyant fields of large enough scale to survive the vertical trip without being turbulently shredded . in this _ letter _ we employ this concept to develop a model relating the observed ratio of coronal to bolometric emission to the fraction of magnetic energy produced in the disk that is of large enough scale to buoyantly rise to the corona . by comparing the implications of our model with observations",
    "we infer that a significant fraction of magnetic energy in accretion disks must reside in large scale fields .",
    "in order for magnetic fields to power coronae and jets , the buoyancy time , @xmath1 , associated with a magnetic structure rising through the disk must be smaller than the time associated with its turbulent diffusion , @xmath2 .",
    "these timescales are estimated as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the disk half thickness and @xmath5 is the characteristic buoyancy speed , and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the turbulent magnetic diffusion coefficient , @xmath8 is the dominant turbulent speed , and @xmath9 is the characteristic scale of a typical ( anisotropic ) turbulent cell , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the escape condition , @xmath11 , sets a lower bound on the scale @xmath12 of magnetic structures that can survive shredding and reach the coronae ( blackman & tan 2003 ) , namely @xmath13 the critical scale applies to the _ smallest _ dimension of a given magnetic structure , i.e. , @xmath14 , since this determines the shortest diffusion time . for a thin magnetic loop",
    "@xmath12 would be the loop thickness not the distance between foot - points . in the @xmath15-viscosity disk framework @xcite , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the sound speed and @xmath18 is the local angular frequency .",
    "using @xmath19 , this implies @xmath20 and thus @xmath21 .",
    "plugging these into equation  ( [ eq : l_gr_lc ] ) implies @xmath22 in a fully developed mhd / mri turbulent flow the velocity of energy containing turbulent motions is approximately ( if not slightly less than ) the rms alfvn speed , i.e. , @xmath23 . therefore if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 , which is larger than @xmath9 for @xmath26 .",
    "if instead we use @xmath27 , the analogous procedure gives @xmath28 .",
    "either way , the buoyant magnetic structures that survive turbulent shredding in the disk must have @xmath29 .    that @xmath30 equals or exceeds",
    "the characteristic turbulent scale implies that an accretion engine with a significant fraction of power emanating from coronae requires a significant fraction of magnetic energy to be organized in magnetic structures of large scale with @xmath31 . in the sections that follow ,",
    "we quantify this fraction by determining @xmath30 and @xmath32 and connect them with the observed ratio of coronal to bolometric emission flux .",
    "we develop a model in which the observed fraction of coronal to bolometric disk luminosity is determined by the rate of large scale magnetic energy rising to the corona .",
    "we assume that buoyant structures fill a volume fraction @xmath33 in the disk such that the average disk mass density is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass densities external to and internal to buoyant structures , respectively .",
    "the average magnetic energy density is then @xmath37 where @xmath38 corresponds to the difference of internal and external magnetic fields squared .",
    "we suppose that although the entire magnetic energy of the structures @xmath39 contributes to their initial buoyancy , only @xmath40 survives to the corona ; the smaller scale fields are `` bled '' away during the buoyant rise .",
    "we define the fraction of the magnetic energy density in scales larger than the critical scale for surviving the buoyant rise to be @xmath41 the factor @xmath33 arises in the numerator because @xmath40 is contained only in the volume of the buoyant structures .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 represents the fraction of magnetic energy with scales larger than @xmath30 , which can be written more generally in terms of integrated magnetic spectra as @xmath43 where the limiting wavenumbers are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the dissipation scale .    motivated by the physical picture described above , we break up the accretion energy per unit area dissipated at a given radius into the sum of the dissipation associated with small scale field within the disk @xmath48 and the dissipation of large scale field in the corona @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the surface density , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total magnetic energy density .",
    "the first term on the right of equation  ( [ eq : d_d ] ) resembles that which would follow from standard disk theory @xcite but with the extra factor of @xmath54 .    defining the ratio of coronal to total dissipation as @xmath55 the ratio of coronal to disk dissipation becomes @xmath56 and depends cleanly on the ratio @xmath57 . since",
    "both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are expected to be dominated by their contributions near the inner radius , we do not address the radial dependence of these quantities in detail here and interpret @xmath60 as an estimate of total coronal to bolometric emission .    , that satisfies eqs .",

    ", we obtain @xmath73    we take the force density acting on the magnetic structure to be @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the upward gravitational buoyancy force density and @xmath76 is the drag force density .",

    "the work done per unit volume by the net force over a distance @xmath4 equals the kinetic energy density of the rising structure , @xmath85 . combining this with equations  ( [ eq : rho_difference])([eq : fd ] ) we obtain @xmath86 therefore , for all buoyant structures @xmath87 since @xmath88 . given that @xmath89 for all structures that fit in the disk , @xmath90 for",
    "all @xmath12 would imply @xmath91 .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to this density ratio regime .",
    "note that our estimate for @xmath92 is itself an upper limit since we consider only a hydrodynamic drag force restricting the buoyant rise , ignoring for example , magnetic tension , c.f .",
    "@xcite . whether the dynamics allows densities below the above upper limit remains an open question .",
    "however , even if the structures were initially able to move faster than @xmath93 , we would expect shocks and the associated dissipation to slow the motion via additional drag .",

    "this last set of curves show that the same ratio of coronal to bolometric emission requires a higher fraction of large scale fields as the buoyancy speed is reduced . ]",
    "vishniac ( 1995 ) estimated a buoyant rise time @xmath100 .",
    "this value is low compared to the upper limit @xmath17 we considered .",
    "had we used @xmath101 , then the value of @xmath42 in equation  ( [ eq : fs_low_lim ] ) would dramatically increase ; highlighting the importance of large scale field for coronal dynamics even more .",
    "some characteristic values of @xmath42 resulting from this smaller buoyancy speed are shown as dashed lines in figure  [ fig : fs_vs_q ] .",
    "setting @xmath102 in equation  ( [ eq : ub_to_cs ] ) , and using equation  ( [ eq : lc ] ) , gives a @xmath103 order equation for @xmath104 as a function of @xmath84 , @xmath61 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the physical solution to this equation is shown in figure  [ fig : lc_to_h ] for a range in drag coefficients , @xmath105 , and for three values of @xmath106 as a function of the density ratio @xmath107 .",
    "the characteristic turbulent scale @xmath108 is also shown as horizontal lines for each value of @xmath15 . since @xmath30 is the minimum scale for buoyant rise , the fact that @xmath109 highlights the importance of large scale fields . for the regime on the plot",
    "where @xmath67 , a buoyant corona can not arise from fields produced internally to the disk .",
    "we can set two constraints on the minimum fraction @xmath42 of magnetic energy that the disk must produce in fields with scales @xmath31 for a given coronal to bolometric emission fraction @xmath60 .",
    "the more stringent bound relies on the fact that @xmath110 for @xmath111 ; a less severe limit is obtained requiring @xmath112 , which is satisfied as long as the density ratio @xmath61 does not fall below the lower limit discussed above . applying these conditions to equation  ( [ eq : dc_to_dd ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath113 then , for an observationally inferred value of coronal to bolometric flux , we can obtain a lower limit on the fraction of magnetic energy residing in large scale fields , i.e. , @xmath114 where we have used that @xmath115 for a keplerian disks .",

    "this result is very encouraging because , despite the fact that both quantities vary over several orders of magnitude across simulations carried out in domains with various sizes and with different field strengths and geometries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , their product remains nearly constant is consistent with the relations below equation  ( [ eq : lc ] ) ; for a disk with mri growth time @xmath118 we expect @xmath119 .",
    "using @xmath120 then gives @xmath121 with a proportionality constant dependent upon anisotropy and the polytropic index @xcite .",

    "the upper limits for the fraction of magnetic energy associated with large scale field structures are shown in figure  [ fig : fs_vs_q ] for three values of the product @xmath123 .",
    "the minimum constraints on @xmath42 illustrated show that , if the observed non - thermal emission is interpreted as coronal emission due to magnetic dissipation from buoyant fields that were produced within a turbulent disk , then a significant fraction of the energy budget of the magnetic field build in the disk must be produced in fields of scale @xmath31 .",
    "since figure  [ fig : lc_to_h ] shows that in general @xmath124 , together these figures highlight the importance of large scale magnetic fields in powering coronae .",
    "finally we note that mhd jets models typically invoke global scale fields , c.f .",
    "if these fields arise from the opening of coronal fields ( as in the sun ; wang & sheeley 2003 : blackman & tan 2004 ) then the mechanical luminosities of jets would represent an additional contribution to that which results from the buoyant rise of magnetic fields .",
    "specifically , @xmath125 in equation ( [ q ] ) would be repalced by @xmath126 where the latter is the jet power .",
    "this would further increase our lower limits on @xmath127 .",
    "in our physical picture , the coronal emission fraction @xmath60 depends on the fraction of magnetic energy @xmath42 produced in scales larger than the critical scale @xmath30 .",
    "we incorporate the density contrast between buoyant structures and the ambient medium required for coronal feeding .",
    "also , our lower limit on @xmath42 employs @xmath93 as an upper limit for the buoyant rise time .",
    "we use the @xmath15-viscosity prescription only for dissipation inside the disk ; the coronal dissipation is modeled as a distinct contribution ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : d_d ] ] and [ [ eq : d_c ] ] ) .",
    "these features differ from those of merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) and the ones summarized in wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in those treatments",
    ", there is no explicit distinction between the density inside and outside the buoyant structures or the role of large and small scale magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , the coronal emission fraction is considered to be a subset of the total dissipation , modeled entirely with the @xmath15-viscosity prescription . also , the buoyant rise time is taken to be the alfvn speed ; less than our upper limit value of @xmath17 .    in the present work",
    "we implicitly consider systems with low enough accretion rates such that radiation pressure is unimportant .",
    "a subtlety associated with radiation pressure is that the thermal photosphere can be significantly higher than the scale at which the magnetic pressure dominates the thermal pressure ( e.g. hirose et al .",
    "thus the non - thermal coronal emission arises at larger scale heights compared to when radiation pressure is ignorable .",
    "the reduction of the coronal emission fraction for such large accretion rate systems is observed in wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for a fixed magnetic spectrum , this would also be expected in our paradigm , because @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eq : lc ] ) is the scale that we consider a buoyant structure must rise to contribute to coronal emission .",
    "if the buoyant structure has to move higher , then @xmath30 would be larger and less of the magnetic energy would survive the buoyant rise . in merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) the reduction in coronal emission for large radiation pressure",
    "occurs because their coronal emission fraction depends inversely on the total disk pressure .",
    "starting with the assumption that coronal luminosity from a turbulent accretion disk results from buoyant magnetic structures that survive turbulent shredding for at least one vertical density scale height , we derived lower limits on : ( _ i _ ) the scale of such magnetic structures and ( _ ii _ ) the fraction of magnetic energy that needs to be produced above this scale within the disk to account for observed values of coronal to bolometric luminosity . in our minimalist model , we considered the buoyant structures to be in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium but to have an additional magnetic energy contribution from scales above the critical scale @xmath30 , and a lower density .",
    "we find that typical ratios of coronal to bolometric luminosity observed in agn require the critical scale for buoyancy to robustly exceed the characteristic scale set by turbulent motions and that double digit percentages of magnetic energy should reside in fields above this scale .",
    "this is consistent with recent work highlighting the importance of in situ large scale dynamos in feeding coronae ( blackman 2007 ; vishniac 2009 ) .",
    "our results complement growing motivation to consider larger domains in stratified mri simulations and motivate analysis of the magnetic energy spectra produced therein",
    ". the results also resonate with models of accretion disks in which buoyancy and coronal dissipation play a primary role for transport ( lynden - bell 1969 ; field & rogers 1993 ) ."
