    "the near - infrared ( nir ) radiation of our and other galaxies is essentially provided by luminous red stars : red supergiants dominate in starburst regions , asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs ) , among which the o - rich and c - rich long period variables ( lpvs ) of various variability types , take over in stellar populations with ages between @xmath2 and @xmath3 years , and first giant branch stars dominate in older regions ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; lanon 1999 ) . in view of the recent developments in nir observational technology ,",
    "tools have become necessary that would allow us to connect nir spectrophotometric signatures with the fundamental stellar properties provided by theoretical stellar evolution tracks . only then can integrated nir emission properties or star counts be interpreted in terms of galaxy history .",
    "these connection tools are also needed from a purely stellar perspective .",
    "the evolution , structure and atmospheres of the evolved red stars are among the standing problems in stellar astrophysics and valuable constraints on the models are to be expected from population studies .",
    "the choice of suitable filter passbands , able to separate stellar subtypes , is a prerequisite for efficient surveys .    in this paper ,",
    "the emphasis is set on lpvs , which constitute the most luminous and coolest but also the most complex population of red giants in regions where more massive red supergiants have died .",
    "static red giant model atmospheres are progressing rapidly due to recent improvements in molecular opacity data ( plez 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "variable star models are still far from satisfactory because of the interplay between pulsation , radiative transfer and chemistry ( see hfner 1999 for a review ) . empirical spectroscopic or spectrophotometric studies",
    "adequate for our purpose have remained scarce because they are time consuming and because a significant wavelength coverage requires synchronised observations : lpv periods are typically one year long and cycle to cycle variations common . in addition , since good infrared instrumentation is usually found on relatively large telescopes that tend to be preferentially directed towards faint sources instead of bright stars , most previous photometric studies of lpvs have been optical ( kerschbaum & hron 1996 ; alvarez & mennessier 1997 ; wing et al .",
    "1998 ) . based on a new , rich sample of complete optical+nir spectra of red stars",
    ", we are able to extend these studies .",
    "the properties of the data are summarised in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .  3 , we discuss spectrophotometric temperature indicators at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "the physical significance and absolute calibration of the empirical scales , in particular for variable stars , will be discussed in more depth elsewhere .",
    "the subsequent sections discuss the ability of commonly used and newly defined nir narrow band indices to separate luminosity , surface chemistry or variability subtypes .",
    "the results are summarised in sect .  10",
    "the reader is refered to lanon & wood ( 1998 ) and lanon & wood , in preparation , for a thorough description of the sample . around one hundred spectra of cool stars ranging from 5100    to 2.5  @xmath4 m",
    "have been obtained at the mount stromlo and siding spring observatories , using the three cross - dispersed grisms of caspir on the 2.3  m telescope ( near - infrared spectra with a resolution r of 1100 ) and a low resolution grating spectrograph on the 74  inch telescope ( optical spectra , r @xmath5 ) .",
    "the sample mainly contains instantaneous spectra of o - rich and c - rich local lpvs , but also includes local non - variable giants and a few luminous lpvs from the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge .",
    "additional spectra restricted to either the optical ( 51009900   ) or the nir region ( 975024900   ) are available for some stars and are included in the analysis whenever possible .",
    "only little is known about effective temperatures of lpvs . in principle",
    ", the effective temperature relates the bolometric luminosity of a star to its effective radius and is thus accessible through surface brightness measurements , i.e.  apparent luminosities combined with angular diameters ( e.g.  perrin et al .",
    "however , due to their very extended atmospheres , lpvs such as miras can not easily be assigned a unique radius : observational determinations are wavelength dependent and depend on the adopted limb - darkening law ( labeyrie et al .",
    "1977 ; baschek et al .",
    "1991 ; hofmann et al .",
    "the use of model atmospheres is inevitable not only in providing these laws in the various observational filter passbands , but also to relate the resulting `` monochromatic '' radii to the effective radius ( usually based on rosseland mean optical depths ) that is used in the effective temperature definition of stellar models .",
    "large uncertainties and inconsistencies between authors occur as a result of e.g.  incomplete treatment of molecular opacities in the models , of different assumptions on the stellar pulsation mode or on whether or not the phase in the pulsation cycle is taken into account ( scholz & takeda 1987 ; haniff et al .  1995 ; van belle et al .  1996 ; bessell et al .  1996 ) .",
    "photometric indices , i.e.  colours and molecular band strength measurements , provide alternative effective temperature estimates ( ramrez et al .   1997 ; alvarez & mennessier 1997 ) .",
    "optical indices define the spectral types , which are calibrated against the effective temperature either on the basis of angular diameter measurements ( ridgway et al .  1980 ; perrin et al .",
    "1998 ) or by direct comparison with synthetic spectra ( fluks et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the calibrations inherit the model dependence already mentioned .",
    "in addition they generally assume a unique relation between spectral type and effective temperature , independent of variability type or time .",
    "this assumption oversimplifies the real situation : alvarez & plez ( 1998 ) have shown that tio and vo bands , two temperature sensitive indicators , do not vary in phase along the mira luminosity cycle , and the data used here contains pairs of spectra with insignificant differences below 1  @xmath4 m but very different nir h@xmath6o vapour bands . as expected from the complex stratification of dynamical atmosphere models ( bowen 1988 ; fleischer et al .  1992 ;",
    "hfner et al .  1998 ) molecular indices contain local information and are sensitive each in its own way to the details of the pulsation history as well as to the global property called effective temperature .    in view of the above difficulties ,",
    "this paper avoids direct comparison with dynamical model atmospheres .",
    "a temperature refered to as the _ `` static '' effective temperature _ ( and noted  throughout the paper for simplicity ) is nevertheless tentatively assigned to each spectrum , based on the fact that the optical part of the static and variable giant spectra in our sample can indeed be reasonably well fitted with static giant models .",
    "the resulting absolute  scales may be biased estimates of the real effective temperatures , but a better understanding of pulsating models is required before these biases can be evaluated and their dependence on the pulsation properties accounted for . the static  scale is used to calibrate photometric temperature scales and all further discussion then relies on purely empirical findings .",
    "the synthetic spectra used for the static  assignment are computed from a large grid of marcs models ( plez et al .",
    "1992 ; plez 1992 ; plez , private communication ) representing red giants with solar composition and different values of atmospheric extension , surface gravities @xmath7 ranging from @xmath10.5 to 3.5 , and of effective temperatures from 2400 to 4750  k. the spectral synthesis includes the updated opacity data for tio ( plez 1998 ) , vo and h@xmath6o as detailed in bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and alvarez & plez ( 1998 ) .",
    "the latest models are preliminary computations of a large new and updated grid now being computed by the uppsala group .",
    "the static  associated with a spectrum is defined here as the effective temperature of the marcs model that provides the minimum @xmath8 fit to the 51009950    data , @xmath7 and atmospheric extension being allowed to vary freely .",
    "we have determined this  for 131 spectra of oxygen - rich giants , among which some are mira , semi - regular ( sra and srb types ) or irregular variables , observed at various phases .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectra to  combined with the step of the model grid allows us to assign   values to @xmath9100  k ( cf .  fig .",
    "the corresponding acceptable @xmath7 values lie between 0.0 and 1.5 , a range over which spectral variations are much smaller than those produced by a 100  k change in .",
    "the following sections discuss narrow band and broad band colours derived from the observed spectra .",
    "we use filters similar to those of wing ( 1967 ) and white & wing ( 1978 ) , adopting the passbands defined by bessell et al .",
    "( 1989a ) ; we complete the set with filters from fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and additional indices designed to measure oh , h@xmath6o and co band strengths .",
    "the vrijhk colours are computed with the passbands of bessell & brett ( 1988 ) and bessell ( 1990 ) .",
    "the zero point calibrations are based on a spectrum of vega ( castelli & kurucz 1994 ) as used by bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : the colours of vega are set equal to zero , except for the wing colours for which we used vega s observed colours ( wing , private communication ) .",
    "most optical colours appear to be quite good temperature indicators ( e.g.  710@xmath1888 , 847@xmath1839 , 710@xmath1745 , 888@xmath1883 as used by wing , or @xmath10 , @xmath11 as in fluks et al .",

    "figure  [ to ] shows the 710@xmath1888 index as a function of the   assigned previously .",
    "this index has been chosen to be our temperature indicator subsequently as its scale of variation is large and the scatter is small .",

    "gives : @xmath15 the standard deviation is 0.3  mag in the range 2500  k @xmath16",
    "@xmath16 3900  k.    it is worth noticing that non - variable and variable stars on one hand , local , bulge and lmc / smc stars on the other hand , all seem to follow the same relation .",
    "this may be surprising at first thought .",
    "in fact , it shows that the relation between the 710@xmath1888 index and the whole optical spectrum used in our @xmath8 adjustment does nt depend strongly on metallicity or variability type .",
    "the optical parts of the spectra all tend to lie on a tight sequence ( which makes the fits with static model spectra possible ) .",
    "it does nt imply , however , that the effective temperature scale along this sequence is independent of the object type or metallicity : our   assignment based on the optical spectrum is liable to be a good estimate of the real effective temperature of static stars , but could be systematically different from the effective temperature in variable objects .",
    "only two bulge stars of our sample were observed in the optical region .",
    "more observations are required to make firm statements on their specific static  versus ( 710@xmath1888 ) relation .",
    "the outlying points in fig .",
    "[ to ] at 710@xmath1888 @xmath17 4 are three observations of svlib , a m8 mira star .",
    "these values of the tio index would lead to particularly low temperatures when extrapolating the (710@xmath1888 ) relation without caution .",
    "however , the global energy distribution of the star and the discussion in the following section argue against such an interpretation .",
    "these points were not taken into account when deriving eq .",
    "( [ fitt ] ) .      for extragalactic study purposes ,",
    "near - infrared temperature indicators are of great interest . indeed , the contribution of agb stars to the emission of a stellar population is largest in this spectral range , and the population synthesis predictions are thus particularly sensitive to temperature  colour  spectral feature relations ( lanon 1999 ) .",
    "we have applied various near - infrared filters to the observed spectra . in fig .",
    "[ ti ] , the wing vo index 105@xmath1104 is plotted against our optical  indicator 710@xmath1888 .",
    "there is a good correlation between the two colours , the vo index becoming a useful  index below 3300  k , as already found by bessell et al .",
    "( 1989a ) from synthetic spectra .",
    "the 104 and 105 filters are shown in fig .  [ vf1 ] .",
    "the scatter of fig .  [ ti ] might be due to atmospheric extension , surface gravity or metal abundance ( bessell et al .",
    "1989a ) but the main source of scatter is certainly variability , miras executing loops in such tio / vo diagrams ( bessell et al .  1996 ; alvarez & plez 1998 ) .",
    "the three outlying points ( 710@xmath1888@xmath184 ) are , again , the observations of svlib .",
    "this m8 mira star has strong tio absorption at 710  nm but normal vo bands ( see also lanon & wood 1998 ) .",
    "the observations were taken at different dates : the effect can not be associated with errors in the acquisition or the reduction of the data .",
    "this star deserves further scrutiny and in particular a more complete phase coverage to clarify its pecularities .",
    "it is difficult to define near - infrared colours more convenient than 105@xmath1104 that might be used as  indicators .",
    "the co ( 2.3  @xmath4 m ) equivalent width suggested by ramrez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) appears inadequate : the correlation with  is only marginally significant in our lpv sample .",
    "the large dispersion is mainly due to variations of the order of 10    in the co equivalent width of individual stars , which are not in phase with the  variations .",
    "differences in metallicity and c / o ratios are likely to contribute to the dispersion .",
    "figure  [ ti+ ] shows the indices most tightly correlated with 710@xmath1888 . the 200@xmath1220 index which is a measure of the strength of h@xmath6o at 2.0 @xmath4 m relative to the continuum point at 2.2 @xmath4",
    "m reveals a more pronounced scatter than the vo index when plotted against the  indicator 710@xmath1888 .",

    "the broad - band colour v@xmath1k is not a pure near - infrared index .",
    "it is a very good effective temperature index for static cool stars , not so much affected by metallicity effects according to bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and we find it very well correlated with the 710@xmath1888 index .",
    "v@xmath1k values have been computed after extrapolating each observed spectrum ( which begins at 5100    and ends at 24900   ) on the blue and on the red sides by the synthetic spectrum which gave the best @xmath8 fit .",
    "the correction is always less than 0.15  mag ( mean : 0.09  mag ) .",
    "bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have determined polynomial fits to empirical effective temperature versus v@xmath1k relations for giants .",
    "figure  [ ct ] shows the comparison between the effective temperature obtained using their relation ( their table  7 , data sets abcd ) and the static  we determined in sect .  3.2 : the agreement is good",
    ". the broad - band colours i@xmath1j and i@xmath1k are almost as good  indicators as v@xmath1k ( fig .",
    "[ ti+ ] ) . a systematic difference between the supergiants ( triangles ) and the other stars",
    "is seen : their i@xmath1j and i@xmath1k tend to be larger at given 710@xmath1888 .",
    "the large spectral region covered by the observations and the fact that the cool stars emit most of their energy in the near - infrared enable us to compute bolometric corrections .",
    "a first order correction to the determination of the bolometric luminosity has been applied by extrapolating the observed energy distributions on the blue and red sides by synthetic spectra as explained in sect .",
    "the mean correction on the bolometric magnitudes amounts to 0.22  mag .",
    "no additional correction was added in the case of dust shell enshrouded stars ( see sect .  5 ) .",
    "the zero - point of the bolometric scale is computed with the following values ( bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) : m@xmath19=4.74 , m@xmath20=4.81 , v@xmath21=@xmath126.76 , f@xmath22=1.371@xmath23 erg@xmath24s@xmath25 .",

    "1998 ) . figure  [ bc ] presents the bolometric correction bc@xmath27 m@xmath28i versus i@xmath1j .",
    "this relation is of particular interest for the ongoing infrared sky surveys like denis ( epchtein 1998 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that local , bulge and lmc / smc stars , and all variability types follow the very same relation : there is a single narrow sequence for oxygen - rich stars .",
    "a polynomial fit gives : @xmath29 the standard deviation of the relation is 0.09  mag .",
    "a complete study of the bolometric corrections derived from this sample will be presented elsewhere ( mouhcine et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the colour indices used in this paper have not been corrected for extinction . to what extent",
    "may interstellar and circumstellar matter bias the two - colour relations and add to their dispersion ?    in order to estimate the effects of interstellar extinction on the colours , we used the extended mean extinction law given by fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) based on the observed mean extinction law of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) and on the theoretical extinction law of steenman & th ( 1989 , 1991 ) . from the tabulated @xmath30 values , we compute the interstellar extinction correction for band @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath31 is the uncorrected index , @xmath34 is the dereddened index , @xmath35 is the response function within the band @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the observed spectrum . as an approximation , we take @xmath37 as the arithmetic mean of all the spectra .",
    "to first order , reddening mimics a shift towards lower temperatures in all the usual broad band two - colour plots ( e.g.  fig .  [ ti+ ] ) .",
    "but molecular band indices may be little affected or even vary orthogonally to the temperature sequence , depending on the separation between the two photometric passbands used , and on the side of the molecular absorption feature on which the `` continuum '' is measured .",
    "thus , the effect of dust is expected to be most obvious in plots that combine a broad band colour and a molecular index .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "most of the local miras are grouped along a sequence at j@xmath1h @xmath38 0.85 .",
    "the dispersion across the sequence is real , i.e.  much larger than observational errors .",
    "but only a small fraction of the dispersion may be associated with interstellar extinction : the motion of individual stars in j@xmath1h during their pulsation cycle is comparable with the width of the sequence ( see the example of the m3 mira xmen on fig .  [ jh ] ) , while the effect of typical values of the optical depth towards local stars is much smaller ( comparable in amplitude to the observational uncertainties ) .",
    "this justifies neglecting interstellar extinction towards local stars .",
    "two local miras with very large j@xmath1h values ( larger than 1.5 ) are identified in fig .",
    "iovir , a m6 mira , was observed twice .",
    "it is a known oh maser ( oh334.7 + 50.0 , turner 1979 ) .",
    "this star is thus enshrouded in an important dust shell .",
    "so is the second extreme mira , wxpsc ( oh128.6 - 50.1 ) .",
    "iovir and wxpsc are the only two miras of our sample with an oh designation : this corroborates the fact that circumstellar matter , as opposed to interstellar matter , is responsible for their red colours .",
    "infrared excess is measured by the ratio f(12",
    "@xmath4m)/f(2.2  @xmath4 m ) ( see habing 1996 and references therein ; le bertre & winters 1998 ) .",
    "this ratio has been derived from the iras psc ( iras science team 1988 ) and from the k magnitude ( gezari et al .",
    "1996 ) , whenever available ( using the calibration of beckwith et al .",
    "( 1976 ) to convert k magnitudes into fluxes at 2.2  @xmath4 m ) .",
    "as expected , fig .",
    "[ ie ] clearly shows that wxpsc and iovir ( and to some extent irc@xmath120427 ) have large f(12  @xmath4m)/f(2.2  @xmath4 m ) ratio .",
    "the presence of cool circumstellar material around these stars is thus confirmed and explains their large j@xmath1h colours .    even in the extremely obscured cases mentioned above",
    ", the data do not indicate a significant contribution of circumstellar continuum emission at wavelengths shorter than 2.4  @xmath4 m . such a warm dust contribution would reduce the equivalent widths of the co bands ( tanaka et al .",
    "no significant reduction is observed in our essentially o - rich sample .",
    "the depths and shapes of the co bands ( @xmath39 2.29  @xmath4 m ) of the naturally reddened spectra compare very well to those of cool unobscured miras like xmen , once the latter have been artificially reddened to match the colours of the former .",
    "the bulge stars systematically lie above the sequence of local optical lpvs .",
    "the interstellar extinction effect is obvious .",
    "the extinction towards the sgri and ngc6522 galactic bulge fields , to which the bulge stars of our sample belong , corresponds to @xmath40 according to estimates in the literature ( wood & bessell 1983 ; glass et al .",
    "1995 ; barbuy et al .",
    "once corrected for reddening , the observed bulge stars lie on the edge of the local mira sequence .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , for bulge stars , a large j@xmath1k index has been used as a selection criterion for inclusion in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "however , the spectra indicate that at least some of the observed bulge stars are reddened more than the average sgri and ngc6522 field stars : for instance , the spectrum of sgri n@xmath4111 ( observed in july 1996 ) is very well matched , in terms of the energy distribution , the molecular bands and the global aspect of metal line blends , by the spectrum of the local mira rshya ( february 1995 ) if @xmath42 .",
    "an equally good match is obtained between the local xmen ( march 1996 ) and ngc6522 n@xmath41435 ( may 1996 ) with @xmath43 .",
    "this additional extinction may be due in various proportions to circumstellar matter and to the patchy distribution of interstellar dust .",
    "similarly high extinction values are found towards various star clusters in the neighbourhood of the galactic centre ( barbuy et al .",
    "1998 ) . only two of the bulge stars of the sample have been detected by iras ( ngc6522 n@xmath41435= iras17593 - 3006 , ngc6522 n@xmath41205=iras 17591 - 2959 ; glass 1986 ; glass et al .  1995 ) .",
    "using the k magnitudes of wood & bessell ( 1983 ) , we obtain 12  @xmath4 m to 2.2  @xmath4 m flux ratios of 1.05 and 1.6 , respectively , i.e.  relatively low values as compared to the local iras sources of fig .",
    "again , the strong co absorption longward of 2.29  @xmath4 m argues against a significant contribution of warm circumstellar dust emission to the near - ir light of the bulge lpvs .",
    "the bulge stars tend to display strong vo and tio bands ; molecular bands need to be observed in a larger unbiased sample in order to determine whether this is or is not due to the selection of red and luminous objects .",
    "the most distinctive features in the near - ir spectra of pulsating red giants are their impressive h@xmath6o absorption bands .",
    "johnson & mndez ( 1970 ) already observed mira type lpvs with much deeper water vapour bands than static giants of similar spectral types .",
    "lpv models ( bessell et al .  1989b ; bessell et al .",
    "1996 ) and observations ( e.g.  matsuura et al .  1999 ) have subsequently confirmed that deep h@xmath6o features are related to pulsation and have provided basic understanding : pulsation produces much more extended atmospheres , and in addition dense cool layers may result from the periodical outwards running shocks . in various ways pulsation",
    "thus leads to the existence of regions where relatively low temperatures ( @xmath44 @xmath45  k or lower ) are combined with relatively high densities , conditions that favour the formation of h@xmath6o and possibly even of dust ( bowen 1988 ; feuchtinger et al .",
    "1993 ; jeong et al .  1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ ti+ ] ( top left ) shows that h@xmath6o absorption indices for lpvs range from 0 to values far above those the coolest static giants reach . at a given stellar energy distribution a large range of h@xmath6o absorption indices",
    "is found ( a similar phenomenon has been described for sio bands by aringer et al .  1999 ) .",
    "even relatively warm lpv spectra ( instantaneous  @xmath17 3500  k ) may display deep water vapour bands , a behaviour that remains to be reproduced quantitatively by lpv models ( mouhcine & lanon 1998 ) . more data ( in particular complete phase coverage for more stars ) is required to gain better insight into the relation between the h@xmath6o features , pulsation amplitude , phase , metallicity and details of the stellar structure .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we conclude that deep h@xmath6o features can be taken as a clear indication for pulsation , while the absence of water vapour does not exclude that the observed star be an lpv .",
    "from a spectrophotometric point of view , supergiants , giants and dwarfs are usually separated mainly on the basis of co and h@xmath6o absorption , which respectively strengthens and weakens from luminosity class v to i ( e.g. aaronson et al .",
    "1978 ; kleinmann & hall 1986 ; origlia et al .",
    "the strength of various metal lines , e.g.  the na doublet at 2.20  @xmath4 m and the ca triplet at 2.26  @xmath4 m , also depend on the luminosity class .",

    "our sample contains 10 supergiant observations : 3 non - variable supergiants , plus 3 semi - regular variables of the src type , plus 3 irregular variables of the lc type , one of them observed twice .",

    "they were initially designed to measure the strength of the 1.7  @xmath4 m c@xmath6 absorption band in carbon stars ( thompson , private communication ) , but actually provide a good h@xmath6o absorption index ( see lanon et al .",
    "1999 for applications to stellar population studies ) .",
