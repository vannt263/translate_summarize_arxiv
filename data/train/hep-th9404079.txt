    "in the quantization of gravity , wavefunctions are functions of the spatial metric and the other fields in the theory .",
    "the requirement of gauge invariance states that wavefunctions are required to obey the operator version of the space and time diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "the weeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation expresses the invariance under the generator of time - diffeomorphisms @xcite and plays a fundamental role in the theory @xcite .    for this reason it is very important to check for any candidate of quantum gravity , whether it engenders the wdw equation .    in two dimensions ( 2d )",
    "gravity the spatial geometry is completely specified by the length of the 1-d boundary , up to spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore the minisuperspace approximation ( considering spatial geometries that are specified by a single scalar factor ) is exact .    in the absence of matter fields ,",
    "the wdw equation in 2d becomes @xcite : [ wdw ] ( -(l)^2 + 4 l^2 + ^2)(l)=0 where @xmath0 are wavefunctions describing the the geometry of space - time .",
    "[ bthe term @xmath1 is obtained by assuming that the states are associated to local operators in kpz conformal theory @xcite and assumes positive half - integer values ..    @xmath2 is the length of the 1-d boundary , @xmath3 is the cosmological constant ( which in the minisuperspace model is restricted be positive ) and @xmath4 is a constant that can have positive half integer values in the case of pure gravity .",
    "the solutions of this equation decaying at large lengths are the modified bessel functions : [ solution ] _",
    "o(l ) ~k_(2 l ) it is quite nontrivial , but true that the same result is obtained by estimating with matrix model techniques appropriate path integral expressions .    in particular , the path integral over all the surfaces with one puncture , one marked point on the boundary , and disk topology ( fig.1 ) was shown in @xcite to correspond to the solution with @xmath5 of  ( [ wdw ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this integral is the amplitude of an universe of length @xmath2 propagated out of a cosmological constant insertion ( geometrically represented as a puncture ) .",
    "a second solution , corresponding to @xmath6 was shown to be obtained by applying the boundary operator on surfaces with disk topology @xcite .",
    "the boundary operator measures the total length of the boundaries .",
    "when applied to a disk , it assumes the expectation value @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the amplitude for the disk .    the path integral expressions solving the equation  ( [ wdw ] ) for higher @xmath4 values do not have such a clear interpretation .",
    "none of the two solutions mentioned above has the original hawking - hartle interpretation of being the amplitude of creating the universe from nothing @xcite : the first one starts with an insertion , and the second one involves the measurement of a particular quantity ( the boundary length ) .",
    "the further search for purely geometric solutions to the wdw equation starting from `` nothing '' was impaired by the difficulties to estimate singular geometries amplitudes by kpz or matrix model techniques .    using a new discrete counting technique , we compute for the first time , the amplitude to propagate out of `` nothing '' an universe with the topology of two tangent circles , named in @xcite `` figure eight diagram '' .",
    "it turns out that this amplitude fulfills the wdw equation  ( [ wdw ] ) corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "we further discuss the geometrical interpretation of this solution .",
    "we demonstrate the generality of our new combinatoric method by calculating in the last part of the letter another singular geometry example @xcite unavailable by previous techniques .",
    "the singular amplitudes computed in this paper are all related to the regular disk amplitude . therefore , in order to describe their properties , we first recall some known facts on the diagrams with disk topology in the matrix model framework .",
    "recall that the partition function of a disk with fixed area @xmath9 and perimeter @xmath2 has the form @xcite : [ part ] z(a , l ) = l^ a^- e^- the loop amplitude is defined to be : [ int ] w(l)=z(a , l ) e^-a and its value is found in @xcite to be : [ resint ] w(l)=l^-e^-2 l(1 + 2 l )    the modified bessel function @xmath10 admits an integral representation with an integrand similar in form to  ( [ part ] ) : [ bes ] k_(z)=()^_0^dt t^--1e^-t- , |argz| < , re z^2>0 . where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we thus learn that  ( [ int ] ) ,  ( [ resint ] ) can be written in terms of the modified bessel functions as : w(l)=l^-1()^k _ ( 2 l )    this result for the regular disk amplitude was found in @xcite by means of semiclassical approximation combined with scaling arguments , as well as by matrix models results .",
    "however , it can also be obtained through direct counting of triangulate surfaces and by taking then the continuum limit @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that by construction , solutions of  ( [ wdw ] ) obtained by conformal field theory kpz techniques , are wavefunctions obtained by the insertion of local states operators .",
    "solutions were sought therefore , by looking for wavefunctions of insertions of conformal operators on a disk . in pure gravity ,",
    "the insertion of the cosmological constant is equivalent to marking a point on the disk .",
    "the explicit formula for the partition function of the marked ( punctured ) disk is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is given by  ( [ part ] ) ) . after applying  ( [ int ] )",
    "this gives for the marked disk wave function _ punct .",
    "disk=()^k _ ( 2 l ) as observed in @xcite this is according to  ( [ solution ] ) a solution of the 2d wdw equation  ( [ wdw ] ) . from the solutions achieved by inserting local conformal operators ,",
    "this is in fact the only one which admits a simple geometrical picture .    by inserting the boundary operator , in the partition function ,",
    "one obtains , as in @xcite @xmath15 . by applying the transform in  ( [ int ] )",
    "this leads to the wave function : [ boundary ] _ boundary = ( ) ^k _ ( 2 l ) which according to  ( [ solution ] ) is also a solution of of the 2d wdw equation  ( [ wdw ] ) with @xmath16 .",
    "the solution we present in the next section has the same functional form like  ( [ boundary ] ) but it is obtained by considering the amplitude for surfaces whose boundary consists of two loops that coincide in one point .",
    "this geometrical interpretation of the universe wave function as the amplitude for a universe originating `` out of nothing '' to split in tangent `` circles '' is a germane to the `` foam '' idea of hawking and hartle for the texture of the universe .",
    "our technique to calculate the `` figure - eight '' and other singular geometry amplitudes is based upon exact counting of random triangulate surfaces @xcite .",
    "we use a recursive equation which is obtained by expressing the change in the partition function of the discrete surface caused by removing one boundary edge .",
    "while the use of the recursion equation is quite complicated in the non - singular diagram case , in the singular diagram case , it consists of only one term which is usually related to an already known regular partition function .",
    "it is lucky that the present method is complementary to the double limit matrix model in the sense that it needs the results of the matrix model for certain regular surfaces but it provides results for the singular geometries which are unavailable in the matrix model framework .    here",
    "we present the continuous version of the argument chain and refere to @xcite for the detailed mathematical formulae which represent these manipulations in a rigorous quantitative way .",
    "the additional rigor @xcite is related to the fact that while in the present exposition we operate on unregularized ( continuum ) surfaces , in @xcite , the lattice provides a well defined basis for counting possibilities .    as an example of the additional rigor provided by the discrete treatment ,",
    "consider the following example . in the paragraphs below we use the fact that the number of ways in which one can split a continuum loop of length @xmath2 into two segments is proportional to @xmath2 . in the lattice calculation",
    "this number is explicitly found to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the loop length , in lattice spacing units @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the minimal length that two loops can have in lattice spacing units ( i.e 6 in the case of triangulate lattice , 8 for a quartic lattice etc  ) and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the technical advantages , the discrete triangulation formulation has methodological advantages .",
    "in fact much of the mathematical formulae expressing the amplitudes properties reported here and in @xcite were suggested to us by the direct simulation and visualization of rts as reported in @xcite .",
    "let us now return to the estimation of the `` figure - eight '' amplitude .",
    "this is obtained by causing the disk boundary to assume the singular geometry shown in ( fig.2 ) .",
    "what is the partition function of such a geometry ?",
    "we first remind the reader that the loop amplitude @xmath8 corresponds in the matrix model to the measurable @xmath22 which creates a hole of length @xmath2 in a discrete surface with lattice spacing @xmath19 .",
    "its computation is made in the matrix model with the convention that one point of the loop is actually _",
    "marked_.    the unmarked amplitude @xmath23 @xcite is related to the marked loop amplitude @xmath8 by the relation : @xmath24 which takes symmetry into consideration .    in order to deduce from a marked point loop amplitude the `` figure - eight '' amplitude , one marks another point on the loop and",
    "identify these two points .",
    "however , if the length of the loops is known ( i.e @xmath25 ) then we need to mark only one point because the position of the second one is determined by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that : [ config ] z_fig.8(a , l_1,l_2)= z(a , l_1+l_2 ) and does not depend on either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "this result is more transparent in the context of triangulate surfaces ( where in fact we found it initially ) .",
    "there , we have expressed by a recursive equation the partition function of a surface with two boundaries .",
    "the recursive formula sums all possibilities of removing one boundary edge .",
    "one of the terms we count is this `` figure - eight '' which is a two - loop surface but has the weight of the @xmath28 disk ( fig.3 ) .",
    "thus  ( [ config ] ) is written in triangulate lattice terms as : z_fig.8(n , l_1+l_2)=z(n-1,l_1+l_2 + 1 ) where @xmath29 is the number of triangles ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    by taking into account all @xmath30 possibilities of dividing the @xmath18 ( @xmath31 ) loop into two ( as explained above )",
    "we find that [ fig8 ] z_fig.8(n , l_1+l_2=l)=(l-5 ) * z(n-1,l_1+l_2 + 1 ) which becomes in the continuum after applying  ( [ int ] ) ( using @xmath32 @xcite ) [ ampfig8 ] w_fig.8(l)= ( ) ^k _ ( 2 l ) and is a solution of the wdw equation .",
    "the equivalence between a disk with two marked boundary points and a `` figure - eight '' , has a further geometrical meaning which was clarified to us by e. witten . in order to discribe it",
    ", one can use fig .",
    "4 . consider a cut through the equator of a nodded torus .",
    "what we find is a continuum version of the triangulate diagram which appears in fig 3 . without specifying the values of the two loop lengths @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "4 is equivalent , after removing the singularity , to a disk with two marked boundary points , just as the nodded torus is equivalent , after removing the singularity , to a sphere with two punctures .",
    "we can further use our knowledge to evaluate other singular geometries.these are obtained by passing from one topology to another . a `` figure - eight '' ( fig .",
    "3 ) is the evaluation of a two loop surface out of a disk .",
    "the `` one handle figure - eight '' ( fig .",
    "5 ) represents the evaluation of a one boundary torus out of a two loop surface .",
    "its amplitude is the amplitude of the @xmath2 possible two loop surfaces of which it is decomposed . using the result of @xcite we have w(l_1,l_2)= we thus find for the `` one handle figure - eight '' ( fig .",
    "5 ) :     the importance of singular geometries , as found in @xcite , is expressed by the role they play in the recursive relation description of partition functions of surfaces with more then one handle or boundary .    indeed , once the singular geometries are under control",
    ", one can contionously relate surfaces with different topologies by `` smoothly '' deforming them into one onother while passing through the appropriate singular topologies .    for instance the @xmath33 boundaries partition function",
    "is expressed by @xmath33 disk - like terms corresponding to the @xmath33 loops , with additional `` figure - eight''-like terms related to a @xmath34 loop surface .",
    "the @xmath35 handle and @xmath33 boundaries partition function is expressed as the @xmath33 boundaries partition function , with additional `` one handle figure - eight''-like terms related to a surface with @xmath36 handles and @xmath37 loops .",
    "this leads to a general strategy for the evaluation of surfaces : once a disk is formed it can dynamically change into other topology with one boundary or more .",
    "the change is done via singular geometries .",
    "it was drawn to our attention by n. seiberg that using this picture one can expect to relate amplitudes of surfaces with various boundary topologies to the disk amplitude .",
    "the relation between the multi - loop and disk amplitudes was found by different techniques in @xcite .",
