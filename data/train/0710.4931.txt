    "the perturbative @xmath19 corrections arise from higher genus world sheets and have recently been understood in @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are also non - perturbative @xmath19-corrections coming from euclidean branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of the cy @xcite . in case of type iia ( even branes )",
    "these arise from euclidean d2-branes ( membranes ) wrapping special lagrangian three - cycles of the cy or ns5-branes wrapping the cy itself . for type iib ( odd branes ) one has d(-1)- , d1- , and d3-branes wrapping points , two- , and four - cycles , respectively , together with d5- and ns5-branes wrapping the cy . with respect to these quantum corrections , the factorization of @xmath13 has the profound consequence that only those subsectors which contain the dilaton ( volume modulus ) receive @xmath19 ( @xmath6 ) corrections . for both iia and iib compactifications",
    "the dilaton sits in a hypermultiplet .",
    "thus determining the @xmath19 corrections to the leea requires understanding @xmath2 , on which we will focus in the following .",
    "when studying @xmath19 corrections , it is useful to observe that the spaces @xmath2 arising from type ii string compactifications ( at string tree - level ) are special in the sense that they admit a @xmath20-dimensional heisenberg algebra of isometries .",

    "working with the tensor potential has the virtue that ( up to a conformal factor @xmath50 ) @xmath40 can be completely expressed in terms of the physical fields , which considerably simplifies the physical interpretation of the quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , the close relation between @xmath40 and the khler potential on the hyperkhler cone over @xmath2 implies that ( discrete ) symmetries of @xmath2 as , e.g. , the sl(2 , @xmath51 invariance of the type iib string , are reflected by the invariance of @xmath40 .",
    "let us close this section by remarking that superconformal invariance of the tm lagrangian implies that @xmath40 is subject to a set of partial differential equations .",
