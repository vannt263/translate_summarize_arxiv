    "since long time light gluinos have attracted attention as a possible carrier of the very high energy signal in the universe . in the 80s , they were studied as a possible primary particle from cyg x-3 @xcite , now as a primary particle of the observed ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) @xcite .",
    "the observations of uhecr with energies above @xmath4  ev impose a serious problem ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the data show the presence of a new , nearly isotropic component in the uhecr flux above the energy @xmath5  ev @xcite .",
    "since the arrival directions of the uhecr show no correlation with the galactic plane and the galactic magnetic field can not isotropize particles of such energies , this component is thought to be extragalactic . on the other hand ,",
    "the signature of extragalactic protons , the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite at @xmath6  ev , is not found .",
    "the other natural uhe primaries , nuclei and photons , must also suffer a similar cutoff . meanwhile",
    ", four different uhecr experiments @xcite do not show the presence of such a cutoff .",
    "the two highest energy events are detected by agasa @xcite and fly s eye @xcite at energy @xmath7ev and @xmath8ev , respectively .",
    "the total number of events with energy higher than @xmath9ev is about 30 , 17 of which are detected by agasa @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the energy determination is estimated to be better than 2030% .",
    "the energies of the two highest energy events @xcite and @xcite are determined very reliably .    to resolve this puzzle",
    ", it seems that new ideas in astrophysics or particle physics are required .",
    "the proposals involving particle physics include uhe particles from superheavy dark matter  @xcite and topological defects  @xcite , the resonant interaction of uhe neutrinos with dark matter neutrinos  @xcite , strongly interacting neutrinos  @xcite , new particles as uhe primaries  @xcite and such a radical possibility as lorentz invariance violation  @xcite .",
    "( for more references see also the reviews cited in @xcite . )    in this paper , we shall consider a gluino - containing hadron ( @xmath10-hadron ) as a carrier of the cosmic uhe signal , being inspired by the correlation between agn and arrival directions of uhe particles suggested by the analyses in refs .",
    "this correlation implies that the signal carrier is neutral and is not absorbed by the cmbr .",
    "the light gluino is a suitable candidate for such a primary : it can be efficiently produced in pp - interactions in astrophysical sources , it is not strongly absorbed by cmbr ( see below ) and it produces eas in the atmosphere very similar to those observed .",
    "heavy gluinos are naturally produced in decays of superheavy particles  @xcite .",
    "we shall study here the interaction of both light and heavy gluinos with nucleons at uhe . in most interesting applications gluinos",
    "must be light ( see below ) . to be a suitable primary of uhecr",
    ", the @xmath10-hadron should satisfy three conditions :    1 .   the longitudinal shower profile of fly s eye highest energy event with @xmath11  ev is well fitted by a proton @xcite ,",
    "though fly s eye collaboration does not exclude a photon as a primary @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath10-hadrons should essentially mimic proton ( or photon ) induced air showers .",
    "2 .   to shift the gzk cutoff to higher energies",
    ", the new hadron should have a mass in excess of the proton mass : the threshold energy for any energy - loss reaction on microwave photons increases with increasing primary mass , while the fraction of energy lost per scattering decreases .",
    "moreover , it is desirable that its cross - section for interactions with cmbr photons is smaller than the proton s one .",
    "this can be achieved if , e.g. , the mass of the first resonance @xmath12 that can be excited in the reaction @xmath13-hadron@xmath14 is relatively large .",
    "3 .   the primary has to be stable or quasi - stable with lifetime @xmath15 in order to survive its travel from a source ( e.g. agn ) at distance @xmath161000  mpc to the earth .    in principle",
    "gluino - containing hadrons ( @xmath10-hadrons ) could satisfy the above requirements .",
    "below we shall shortly review the status of @xmath10-hadrons as uhecr signal carrier .    to satisfy the third condition",
    ", the gluino should be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , or have a very small mass difference with the lsp .",
    "it also can be the second lightest supersymmetric particle , if the lsp is the gravitino ; in this case the gluino decays gravitationally and its lifetime can be long enough .",
    "theoretically the best motivated candidates for the lsp are the neutralino and gravitino . while in minimal supergravity models",
    "the lsp is the lightest neutralino ( in some part of the parameter space it is the sneutrino ) , in models with gauge - mediated susy the lsp is normally the gravitino . in farrar",
    "s model  @xcite , the gluino is the lsp because the dimension - three susy breaking terms are set to zero .",
    "a theoretically more appealing scenario containing a light gluino was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the gluino with mass 1100  gev was found in a so(10 ) model with gauge - mediated susy breaking and higgs - messenger mixing . in this model either the gluino or",
    "the gravitino is the lsp . in the latter case ,",
    "the gluino can decay but has a sufficiently long lifetime to be a viable uhecr primary , @xmath17  yr .    in a physical state , the gluino is bound into colourless hadrons .",
    "what is the lightest state of gluino - containing hadrons ?    in the 80s ( see @xcite ) , it was argued on the basis of qcd sum rules that the _ glueballino _ @xmath18 is the lightest @xmath10-hadron .",
    "the lightest baryonic state , _ gluebarino _ , was demonstrated to be the @xmath19-hadron @xcite .",
    "gluebarino is a long - lived particle because its decay needs either violation of baryon number or r - parity @xcite .",
    "more recently , farrar proposed @xcite the neutral hadron @xmath20 , a @xmath21 bound - state , as the lightest @xmath10-hadron ( see also the calculations in the mit bag model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there is some controversy if a light gluino , with a mass of a few gev , is allowed .",
    "as it stands , the farrar model @xcite is in conflict with searches for glueballino decays @xcite as well as for decays of other unstable @xmath0-hadrons @xcite .",
    "however , these searches had been restricted to a narrow band of lifetimes and masses , and their results are not valid in the context of more generic models .",
    "the existence of a light gluino ( @xmath22  gev ) can be ( dis- ) proved due to its contribution to the running of @xmath23 and to qcd colour coefficients in a practically model - independent way .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the ratio @xmath24 between the hadronic and the @xmath25 production cross - section in @xmath26 annihilation at different energies to constrain the light gluino scenario .",
    "they excluded light gluinos with mass @xmath27  gev with 93(91)% cl , while the mass range @xmath28  gev remained essentially unconstrained . combining these results with the determination of qcd colour coefficients from the analysis of multi - jet events in  @xcite ,",
    "the conclusions of @xcite became much stronger : light gluinos with mass @xmath29  gev were excluded with at least 99.89% cl .",
    "the analysis of multi - jet events relied however on the use of monte carlo simulations which parameters are tuned to qcd without light gluinos .",
    "moreover , the multi - jet analysis was based on a tree - level calculation with rather large scale ambiguities .",
    "the assessment of these uncertainties is difficult , thus preventing the definite exclusion of a very light gluino by this argument  @xcite .",
    "direct accelerator limits for the gluino as lsp were discussed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite : the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the range @xmath30 130150  gev can be excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "based on currently available opal and cdf data .",
    "their results are sensitive to the details of the hadronic interactions of @xmath0-hadrons and , for certain choices of the parameters , a window in the intermediate mass region @xmath31 remains open",
    ". meanwhile , ref .",
    "@xcite noted that these limits could be weakened if squarks are not very heavy and contribute to the jet + missing energy signal , while ref .",
    "@xcite confirmed an open window for a gluino with @xmath32 .",
    "we also mention here that cosmological constraints do not exclude both light and heavy gluinos of interest  @xcite .",
    "the gustafson experiment @xcite does not exclude @xmath10-hadrons ( see section 5 ) .",
    "till now we discussed the limits on the gluino mass @xmath33 .",
    "the lightest @xmath10-hadron with mass @xmath34 is heavier than the gluino by the mass of its constituent gluon or quarks , which are expected to be less than 1  gev .",
    "light @xmath10-hadrons with @xmath35  gev have a spectrum with the gzk cutoff beyond the currently observed energy range ( see @xcite and fig .  [ spec_einf ] of the present paper ) .",
    "together with the accelerator limits on gluino masses this leaves a narrow band of allowed masses for the light @xmath10-hadrons at @xmath36gev . but this window is closed if , as argued in @xcite , the charged gluebarino @xmath37 is lighter than the neutral @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , production of charged gluebarinos in the earth atmosphere by cosmic rays and their accumulation in the ocean results in too high abundance of `` wild hydrogen '' in contradiction with observational data . in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , it is argued that the lightest gluebarino is the neutral flavour singlet @xmath21 , due to strong quark attraction in this state .",
    "but even in this case the restriction @xcite might work , if @xmath21-gluebarino and proton are bound into anomalous deuterium .    in conclusion ,",
    "a light gluino  although being disfavoured by various arguments  is not excluded .",
    "we are studying here the interactions of gluinos , being inspired by a possible correlation between agn and the arrival directions of uhecr  @xcite and by the recent suggestion @xcite , that extensive air showers ( eas ) observed at the highest energies could be produced by @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed simulation of eas induced by @xmath0-hadrons , using however a phenomenological description for the @xmath0-hadron - nucleon interaction which is not self - consistent .",
    "they found that masses as high as 50  gev are compatible with presently available data .",
    "in contrast , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , using kinematical arguments , that the observed shower characteristics exclude any strongly interacting particle much heavier than a few gev .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study eas produced by @xmath0-hadrons and to restrict the mass range in which the @xmath0-hadron is a viable uhe primary using a self - consistent interaction model .",
    "we have used for the simulation of air showers initiated by @xmath0-hadrons a suitably modified version of the qgsjet model  @xcite which is known to describe successfully proton air showers @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have considered the glueballino as the @xmath10-hadron but we expect that our results apply to all @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "we paid special attention to consistent calculations of glueballino - hadron interaction cross - sections and of cascade particle production in the atmosphere .",
    "we have found that the development of showers initiated by @xmath0-hadrons with masses above 5  gev differs substantially from proton - initiated showers and is inconsistent with the current experimental data . in the window of masses",
    "1.54  gev , where a @xmath10-hadron can be allowed , glueballino - induced showers do not contradict the available data .",
    "future observations by the detectors hires and auger can either confirm or exclude @xmath0-hadrons as the dominant primary combining the information from shower profiles and energy spectrum .",
    "however , the best way to test this hypothesis is a modified gustafson experiment ( see section 5 ) . in the case of the discovery of light @xmath10-hadrons in such an experiment",
    "we shall reliably know their properties , thus enabling us to calculate the production of these particles in astrophysical sources and their detection in the earth atmosphere .",
    "their absence will preclude further discussion of this hypothesis .",
    "qgsjet , a monte carlo generator of hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus , and nucleus - nucleus interactions @xcite , was developed in the framework of the gribov - regge approach and is based on the quark - gluon string model of the supercritical pomeron @xcite .",
    "hadronic interactions are described as a superposition of elementary rescattering processes between the partonic constituents of the projectile and target nucleons ( hadrons ) , resulting in the production of colour neutral strings , which further fragment into secondary hadrons .",
    "the key parameters of the model are the intercepts and the slopes of the regge trajectories of the pomeron and of secondary reggeons .",
    "these parameters govern the formation of different interaction configurations , how the energy - momentum is shared in elementary interactions , and also the string hadronization .",
    "the model was generalized to hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions in the framework of the glauber - gribov approach  @xcite , taking into account low mass diffraction and inelastic screening processes @xcite .",
    "hard qcd processes were included into the gribov - regge formalism via the concept of a `` semihard pomeron '' , which is a @xmath38-channel iteration of the soft pomeron and a qcd parton ladder contribution @xcite .",
    "qgsjet describes hadron - hadron interaction amplitudes as a sum of two contributions , namely soft and semihard rescatterings @xcite .",
    "the soft contributions are of purely nonperturbative nature and correspond to the case of a parton cascade with virtualities smaller than some cutoff @xmath39 . below this cutoff ,",
    "perturbative qcd is not applicable and the interaction is described by phenomenological soft pomeron exchange .",
    "the amplitude @xmath40 for pomeron exchange between two hadrons @xmath41 and @xmath42 is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rapidity size of the pomeron , @xmath45 is the squared center - of - mass energy for the interaction , @xmath46 is the impact parameter between the two hadrons , and the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the vertices and slopes for the pomeron - hadron @xmath49 coupling , respectively",
    ". finally , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the parameters describing the overcriticality and the slope of the soft pomeron trajectory .",
    "contrary to soft rescatterings , semi - hard ones correspond to the case when at least a part of the parton cascade develops in the region of parton virtualities @xmath52 and , therefore , can be described on the basis of qcd techniques .",
    "the complete semi - hard contribution is represented by a qcd parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons @xcite . for the pomeron , the formulas ( [ softpom]-[lambda ] ) can still be used . however , since it is now coupled to a hadron @xmath49 on one side but to a parton ladder on the other side , the slope @xmath53 and the coupling @xmath54 have to be replaced by the slope @xmath55 and the coupling @xmath56 of the pomeron - ladder .",
    "the latter is parameterised as @xmath57^{\\beta_{\\p}},\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 describe the momentum distribution of a parton ( sea quark or gluon ) in the soft pomeron . using @xmath60 ,",
    "the slope @xmath55 can be neglected .    to complete the description of soft and semihard contributions ,",
    "the momentum distribution function @xmath61 for soft pomeron emission by a hadron of type @xmath41 has to be specified .",
    "it is parameterised in the form @xmath62 where the first factor does not depend on the hadron type and describes the probability to slow down the hadron constituents to which the pomeron is connected . in qgsjet",
    ", the pomeron is connected to a ( dressed ) quark - antiquark pair .",
    "using regge asymptotics @xcite , i.e. @xmath63 as the intercept of the regge @xmath64-trajectory for light quarks , it follows @xmath65 similar , the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) describes the probability to slow down the `` leading '' hadron state configuration ; the parameter @xmath66 is expressed via the intercept @xmath67 of the corresponding regge trajectory as @xmath68 .",
    "the semihard contribution described above corresponds to the case that gluons or sea quarks of the hadron start the interaction at the initial scale @xmath39 .",
    "additionally , valence quarks can interact with @xmath69 .",
    "then the only nonperturbative input needed are the valence quark momentum distributions @xmath70 at the initial scale @xmath39 .",
    "the nucleon - glueballino interaction can be treated in the qgsjet model in the same framework as the one for usual hadrons @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is to connect the unknown physical parameters ( coupling @xmath71 , slope @xmath72 and momentum distribution @xmath73 ) describing the interactions of glueballinos with the corresponding quantities of usual hadrons .",
    "we use simple scaling arguments to derive the glueballino parameters from those of the pion :    1 .",
    "the coupling @xmath74 of a hadron @xmath41 to the pomeron depends essentially on its size and , consequently , on its reduced mass @xmath75 . if @xmath76 denotes the radius of the hadron @xmath41 with the reduced mass @xmath75 , then @xmath77 , where we have neglected a factor @xmath78 in the last step .",
    "thus , the pomeron - glueballino vertex @xmath71 can be expressed via the pomeron - pion vertex @xmath79 as @xmath80 for the reduced mass @xmath81 of the glueballino , we use @xmath82 where @xmath33 is the mass of the gluino and @xmath83  gev is the constituent mass of the gluon .",
    "similar , we use for the pion @xmath84 with @xmath85  gev as quark constituent mass . note that eq .",
    "( [ gammaglu ] ) does not take into account the different colour factors of quarks and gluon / gluinos because we consider an effective pomeron coupling to the hadron as a whole , not to individual parton constituents .",
    "the slope @xmath72 for the pomeron - glueballino coupling is also inverse proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 is small compared to @xmath87 and @xmath88 and can be neglected in the formulas ( [ softpom]-[lambda ] ) , @xmath89 3 .   the momentum distribution for pomeron emission is again given by eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , now the `` leading '' configuration consists of a valence gluon and gluino , @xmath90 assuming that a valence gluon behaves similar to a valence @xmath91-pair in the low @xmath92-limit gives @xmath93 .",
    "the remaining unknown parameter @xmath94 can be found from the momentum distribution between the valence constituents of the glueballino .",
    "using as ansatz for the momentum distribution @xmath95 of the gluino @xmath96 and assuming that the energy is shared according to the constituent masses of the valence partons , we obtain for the average momentum fraction carried by the gluino @xmath97 this results in @xmath98    having fixed the free parameters describing the pomeron - glueballino interactions using essentially only one simple , physically well - motivated scaling argument , the soft and semi - hard contributions are determined .",
    "these two contributions to the total nucleon - glueballino interaction are referred below as the contribution due to the _ soft coupling _ , because they are both caused by soft pomeron emission of the glueballino .    to complete the formalism",
    ", we need to define the momentum distributions of the valence gluon or gluino inside the glueballino probed at the initial scale @xmath99 , when they are involved into hard interactions .",
    "we shall refer to this contribution below as the the contribution due to the _",
    "direct coupling_. parton emission by a gluino in the @xmath45-channel is strongly suppressed kinematically in the nonperturbative region @xmath100 by its mass : the virtuality @xmath101 of the process @xmath102 is determined by the off - shellness @xmath103 of the produced @xmath38-channel gluino , @xmath104 here @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the transverse momentum and the light cone momentum fraction for the @xmath38-channel gluino .",
    "therefore , the gluino momentum distribution at the scale @xmath39 essentially remains in the form ( [ glumom ] ) , @xmath107 by contrast , the momentum distribution of the valence gluon differs from @xmath108 in ( [ glumom ] ) because of the emission of sea quarks and gluons ( due to the soft coupling defined above ) , @xmath109 the parameter @xmath110 is fixed by the momentum conservation constraint for the complete ( valence and sea ) parton momentum distributions at the initial scale @xmath99 .",
    "this completes the formulation of the initial conditions for the perturbative evolution .",
    "the treatment of the perturbative part of the interaction is performed to leading - log accuracy , the corresponding techniques are described in ref .",
    "all emitted ( @xmath45-channel ) partons undergo timelike cascading according to the standard algorithm @xcite , with soft gluon coherence taken into account . at the final stage ,",
    "soft strings are assumed to be formed between on - shell partons according to their colour connection pattern .",
    "the final gluino is assumed to pick up a gluon - gluon singlet pair from the vacuum . after a colour rearrangement similar to the one in @xmath111 production , a glueballino is formed .",
    "string hadronization completes the procedure for glueballino - hadron interaction .",
    "the extension of the model to glueballino - nucleus collisions is based on the standard glauber - gribov approach and does not differ from the usual hadron - nucleus case @xcite .",
    "the model developed in the last subsection allows both to calculate the cross - sections for glueballino - nucleon interactions and to treat consistently particle production in these reactions .",
    "some quantities characterising the glueballino - nucleon interactions are given in table  1 for @xmath112  gev and in table  2 for @xmath113  gev .",
    "we present both total and inelastic cross - sections as well as the partial contributions arising due to the soft ( @xmath114 ) and direct ( @xmath115 ) coupling of the glueballino and @xmath115 , because it contains contributions from multiple rescatterings of both types . ] . at low energies ,",
    "the soft coupling strongly dominates the @xmath116-proton interaction for all @xmath81 being governed by nonperturbative soft interactions , while the direct coupling can be neglected . at high energies , this picture changes considerably .",
    "the soft coupling becomes more and more suppressed for large @xmath81 . by contrast , the direct contribution , which is purely perturbative on the glueballino side , is nearly independent of @xmath81 .",
    "this important difference from the usual hadron case is due to the very asymmetric energy partition between parton constituents of the glueballino . for large @xmath81 ,",
    "the valence gluino carries almost the whole initial energy of the particle ( 88% for @xmath117 gev and 99% for @xmath118 gev )  eqs .",
    "( [ glumom]-[xglu ] ) , ( [ gluv ] ) , thus leaving just a small part of it to other partons , to which pomerons are connected",
    ". therefore , the glueballino behaves in the limit of large @xmath81 essentially as a perturbative object , as one expects from kinematical considerations @xcite .",
    "finally , the last raw of the tables shows the inelasticity coefficient @xmath119 as another important quantity which distinguishes proton - proton and @xmath116-proton interactions .",
    "although at energies of interest for uhecr the total cross - section for @xmath116-proton interactions is rather large , a heavy glueballino behaves like a penetrating particle in the atmosphere loosing only a small part of its energy in one interaction .",
    "this conclusion was already reached in ref .",
    "@xcite from semiqualitative considerations .",
    "the reason for this effect is twofold .",
    "on one side , as discussed above , gluinos of larger masses carry a larger fraction of the initial particle energy , leaving a smaller part of it for the sea constituents ( ( anti-)quarks and gluons ) and thus reducing the average number of multiple interactions in @xmath116-proton ( nucleus ) collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative weight of the `` direct hard '' process increases for heavier gluinos , where the valence gluino loses typically only a small part of its energy , as a large longitudinal momentum transfer is strongly suppressed in that case by the process virtuality @xmath120 , @xmath121 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 being the transverse momentum and the light cone momentum fraction for the @xmath38-channel gluon emitted of the initial valence gluino which mediates the gluino hard interaction with the target proton ( nucleus ) .",
    "we show also in figs .",
    "[ tot ] and [ inel ] the total and inelastic cross - sections as function of the interaction energy @xmath122 for glueballino masses @xmath123 and @xmath124  gev .",
    "the fast increase of the direct contribution with @xmath122 produces an interesting effect : the total interaction cross - section for the largest glueballino mass considered , @xmath125  gev , which is dominated by the direct contribution , overshoots the ones for smaller glueballino masses in the energy range @xmath126  gev .",
    "in this section , we present some results of our simulations for the glueballino - initiated eas .",
    "shower profiles and distributions of shower maxima are shown in figs .",
    "[ pro_e20][xmax_e17 ] for three different initial energies , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath4  ev , for the glueballino as primary with different choices of the gluino mass . for comparison ,",
    "the case of a primary proton is also shown . at the highest energy considered , @xmath129  ev",
    ", the longitudinal shower profiles ( fig .  [ pro_e20 ] ) and the distribution of the shower maxima @xmath130 ( fig .  [ xmax_e20 ] ) of glueballino - induced eas are comparable with those induced by protons in the case of glueballino masses smaller than 5  gev . as the glueballino mass increases , the shower develops deeper in the atmosphere with a less pronounced maximum .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath131 increase also for larger glueballino masses .",
    "the main reason for both effects is the competition between the large glueballino - nucleus cross - section and the small inelasticity of the interactions : a heavy glueballino injects in one interaction only a small part of its energy into secondary hadronic and electromagnetic cascades , while interactions with a large momentum transfer are rare and increase only the fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ xmax_e20 ] clearly shows that the glueballino - induced eas drastically differ from the proton - induced showers for glueballino masses larger than 5  gev , and hence these showers can be distinguished even in case of low statistics . in case of a lighter glueballino with @xmath132  gev ,",
    "a larger statistics is necessary to distinguish glueballino from proton , when only @xmath130 measurements are used .",
    "the same conclusions can be drawn comparing the shape of the calculated profiles for individual @xmath133- and @xmath116-induced eas of energy @xmath134 ev with the corresponding measurements of the fly s eye collaboration  @xcite , cf .",
    "[ fe ] . in doing",
    "so we choose only those showers which reach their maxima near the measured value @xmath135 g/@xmath136 .",
    "then we average the obtained profiles and shift them to the same position of the shower maximum , @xmath137 g/@xmath136 .",
    "it is easy to see that for gluino masses larger than 5  gev the shape of the calculated profile strongly disagrees with the experimental observations .",
    "the account for the lpm effect results in only 5% reduction of the electron number in the shower maximum for proton - induced eas  @xcite and has an even smaller influence on the @xmath116-induced showers due to much softer @xmath138-spectrum in the glueballino interactions .",
    "the calculated lateral distribution functions ( ldfs ) for electrons and muons ( @xmath139 gev ) at the akeno observation level ( 900  g/@xmath136 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ ne ] and [ nmu ] for the proton and glueballinos with masses 2 and 5 gev .",
    "the plotted values are the ldfs of electrons and muons @xmath140 , @xmath141 at different distances @xmath24 from the shower core .",
    "although these distributions are substantially different for showers initiated by glueballinos and protons , they hardly can be used to search for the light glueballino on the basis of existing data , e.g. , of agasa .",
    "an adequate tool for the glueballino search is the fluctuation of the muon density at distances @xmath142  m from the core .",
    "this method allows in principle to discriminate showers initiated even by light glueballinos with @xmath143  gev from proton - initiated eas ( see table  [ fluc_mu ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall compare our results with those of albuquerque , farrar and kolb ( afk ) @xcite .",

    "5th entry , @xmath148 , in table 1 and 2 ) : at energies relevant for uhecr , the interactions considered by afk are only subdominant and result in much smaller total cross - sections as compared with ours or those assumed by afk .",
    "although both valence constituents of the glueballino are electrically neutral , uhe glueballinos loose energy due to scattering on cmbr photons .",
    "the value of the cutoff in its energy spectrum is determined by the transition from adiabatic energy losses ( redshift ) to rapidly increasing energy losses due to the reaction @xmath149 at higher energies .",
