    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is turbulent , as known from observations of non - thermal cloud velocities @xcite , and also expected on theoretical grounds , because of the very large reynolds numbers ( defined as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces ) .",
    "understanding turbulence is crucial for understanding of many physical processes , including energy injection into the ism , non - photoelectric heating of the ism , star formation , propagation of cosmic rays , and heat transport .",
    "( see review by @xcite,@xcite ) , and references therein",
    ".    obtaining properties of ism turbulence from observations is a long - standing problem ( see review by @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the statistics of the random velocity field is essential for describing the turbulence . to obtain the velocity statistics , so - called velocity centroids ( @xcite )",
    "have been frequently attempted .",
    "however , the separation of the velocity and density contributions to the velocity centroids has always been a problem .",
    "therefore the relation between the statistics of velocity and velocity centroids is frequently claimed to be trustworthy only when the density fluctuations are negligible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "to remedy this situation a statistical technique termed velocity channel analysis , or in short vca , was developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully used to obtain the spectra of turbulence in   in small magellanic cloud and the milky way ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , the vca requires turbulence to be supersonic and to follow power laws ( see @xcite ) .    this paper will identify a technique that can be reliably used with turbulence even if the turbulence is subsonic and/or does not obey a power - law .",
    "the latter case can occur when , for instance , self - gravity modifies the turbulence on small scales . in pursuing this goal",
    "we introduce modified velocity centroids ( mvcs ) and derive an analytical relation between the statistics of mvcs and the underlying statistics of the 3d turbulent velocity .",
    "there has been substantial progress in understanding of compressible magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence ( see a review by @xcite ) that will guide us in adopting the model for this paper .",
    "numerical simulations in @xcite revealed anisotropic spectra of alfvn and slow waves , as well as an isotropic spectrum of the fast waves .",
    "the anisotropies are elongated along the local direction of magnetic field .",
    "however , since this local direction changes from one place to another , the anisotropy in the system of reference related to the mean magnetic field is rather modest , i.e. of the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dispersion of the random magnetic field . for typical ism @xmath2 @xcite and",
    "the expected anisotropy is modest .",
    "therefore it is possible to characterize the turbulence using isotropic statistics ( see testing in @xcite and in  4 ) .",
    "only z - components of the velocity are available through doppler shift measurements .",
    "in what follows we shall assume that the velocity and density of the gas can be presented as sums of a mean value and a fluctuating part : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the fluctuating components @xmath7 and @xmath8 satisfy the condition @xmath9 , @xmath10 . henceforth we use @xmath11 to denote ensemble averaging .",
    "the correlation function of the z - component of velocities at two points @xmath12 and @xmath13 , separated a distance @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , denoted by subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 . and",
    "it is related to the component of the 3d spectrum through a fourier transform ( see @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the projection of the spectral tensor , expressed through the transversal @xmath23 and longitudinal @xmath24 ( normal and parallel to @xmath25 , respectively ) 3d spectra of the velocity field , which are functions of the wavenumber amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , the two point density statistics can be given by the structure function @xmath27 .",
    "in what follows we consider the emissivity of our media proportional to the first power of density line . for recombination radiation ( such as h@xmath28 for instance )",
    "the emissivity is proportional to the square of the density , and modifications of the present technique are necessary . ] and no absorption present . in this case , the intensity , @xmath29 , is proportional to the column density , where @xmath30 is the density of emitters in the position - position velocity ( ppv ) space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , @xmath31 , where , @xmath32 is the density of atoms , @xmath28 is a proportionality constant , @xmath33 denotes integration along the line of sight , and @xmath34 is a two dimensional vector in the plane of the sky .",
    "the structure function of mvcs consists of two terms",
    ". it will be clear from the discussion below that it may be safe to use ordinary centroids when the second term is much smaller than the first term .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 ^ 2 - \\langle v^2 \\rangle \\left[i(\\mathbf{x_1})- i(\\mathbf{x_2})\\right]^2 \\right\\rangle \\label{m}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a `` unnormalized centroid '' of the z - component of velocity @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . to simplify our notations",
    "we shall omit the @xmath40 and @xmath41-subscripts ( also for eq.([m ] ) ) .",
    "we do not discuss the effect of @xmath42 separately because for the technique presented here it acts in the same way as regular motion , and one can formally introduce @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 , that is , at a given position @xmath34 , integrating along the line of sight in the expression for @xmath37 and @xmath45 may be advantageous . in terms of @xmath37",

    ", the velocity dispersion @xmath45 can be obtained using the second moment of the spectral lines :    @xmath47    to express the 2d statistics of the modified centroids @xmath48 through the underlying 3d velocity and density statistics we shall have to make several elementary transformations .",
    "first of all , the difference of integrals that enter the expression for the modified centroids should be presented as a double integral . then using an elementary identity @xmath49 $ ] it is possible to find ( see @xcite ) @xmath50 , \\label{s2}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 . using the millionshikov hypothesis ( see @xcite ) to relate the fourth moments of the fields with the second moments , namely that @xmath52 we get sufficient simplifications of the expression : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denote the cross terms arising from correlations between the fluctuations of the velocity and density @xmath55    the correlations between velocity and density fluctuations have been studied earlier @xcite and found not to have a strong impact on the vca . in particular , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ cr ] ) was directly obtained in @xcite , and numerical integration of the corresponding fluctuations provides fluctuations in the centroid value that does not exceed 8% of the mvcs values at small @xmath56 . in this paper",
    "we will neglect the cross terms and test this assumption by analyzing synthetic maps of compressible mhd simulations . a more detailed analysis , with more sets of data , and the cross terms ,",
    "will be included in a forthcoming paper .",
    "( [ d ] ) depends on both density and velocity statistics .",
    "the dominant contribution arising from density fluctuations is the first term of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "integration of this term yields the second term in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , as result the expression for the mvcs is @xmath57 , \\label{m2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 if @xmath59 then eq.([b ] ) recovers the statistics of the velocity field .",
    "this is certainly the case if the turbulence is subsonic , where the amplitude of the density fluctuations is small , or when the density spectrum is steep ( i.e. most of the power residing at large scales ) given that we are interested in the fluctuations at small @xmath60 . with @xmath61 . if @xmath62 the spectrum is _ shallow _",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "] however , if the amplitude fluctuations of density at small scales is large ( i.e. shallow spectrum or highly supersonic turbulence ) , the contribution could be important .",
    "if we omit the density term in eq.([b ] ) and take a 2d fourier transform to resulting distribution of mvcs we have : @xmath63 where we have used again the notation of using capital letters to distinguish 2d vectors from the 3d counterparts . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ corr - spect ] ) , and ( [ spect ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) one gets @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the extent of the emitting region ) and the second term provides only a @xmath69 function contribution at @xmath70 . thus eq . ( [ final ] ) provides a relation ) but implicitly assumed that @xmath71 ( see also @xcite ) . ] between the spectrum of the modified centroids and the transversal spectrum of the 3d velocity field .",
    "we should note that the relation in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) does not depend on a particular form ( power - law is a common assumption ) of the underlying spectra . if the turbulent velocity field is mostly solenoidal ( see @xcite ) , the isotropic spectrum @xmath72 that is used for describing hydrodynamic turbulence is uniquely defined through @xmath73 , namely , @xmath74 .",
    "in what follows we will include the normalized centroids in their usual form ( see @xcite ) @xmath75 intuitively it is clear that the power spectrum of the centroids given by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) should provide a better fit to the power spectrum of the velocity ( the spectral index , not the amplitude ) than that of @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , the contributions of density fluctuations are mitigated by the division over the column density in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "the testing was done using the files obtained through simulations of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "the description of the code and the numerical simulations can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we use the same data cube that we used in @xcite .",
    "namely , the dimension of the cube is @xmath76 , and the mach number @xmath77 .",
    "the result of the mhd simulations are velocity , density and magnetic field data .",
    "we use density and velocity to produce spectral line data cubes , the procedure is described in @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath37 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 from synthetic spectral line data cubes .",
    "the spectra @xmath80 were obtained by applying a fast fourier transform to the 2d distribution of the centroids and column density values .",
    "the power spectrum of the mvcs was calculated subtracting @xmath45 times the column density power spectrum , from the power spectrum of @xmath37 ( see eq .",
    "[ m ] ) . for the original data cubes ( with a steep density spectrum ) , the differences among all three types of centroids were marginal for the dynamical range studied , although unnormalized centroids systematically show more deviations from the velocity power spectrum . to enhance the effect of density",
    ", we made the density shallow by changing the fourier components of the density amplitudes , but , in order to preserve the density - velocity correlations , we kept the phase information ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig 1 .",
    "it is clear that the three measures provide a good fit at large scales , but at small scales normalized and unnormalized centroids tend to be density dominated .",
    "an additional advantage of using mvc over the conventional normalized centroids is that mvc provides the correct amplitude of the spectrum , while normalized centroids at best give the correct index ( logarithmic slope ) .    .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the spectrum of density modified by changing the amplitudes the fourier components of the original spectrum .",
    "the modified density spectrum @xmath81 for the inertial range .",
    "the vertical position of the normalized centroids ( _ triangles _ ) is shifted vertically for visual purposes .",
    "[ fig : comp_mhd],width=332 ]    it is also clear that for a shallow density spectrum , the improvement from unnormalized centroids to normalized centroids is marginal .",
    "our numerical study shows that mvcs are advantageous when the underlying spectrum of density is dominated by fluctuations at small scales . and",
    ", the main advantage of mvcs is that they allow an explicit statistical description of the procedures involved , which makes the analysis more reliable .",
    "our study revealed that the mvcs can be successfully used to obtain the velocity statistics from synthetic observational data .",
    "another technique , namely , the vca is complementary to the mvcs .",
    "vca is more robust to density - velocity correlations .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that vca can provide correct statistics of velocity fluctuations even in the case when the velocity and density are correlated at their maximum given by the cauchy - swartz inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the contrary , if we assume such a maximum correlation for the mvcs we will not get the correct scaling . comparing results obtained with the mvcs and the vca one can get a better handle on what are the velocity statistics .",
    "it is advantageous to combine vca and mvcs techniques .",
    "we can apply vca to the largest scales , where turbulence is supersonic , and study mvcs at all scaless , including those where the turbulence becomes subsonic .",
    "the correspondence of the spectral slope obtained with the two different techniques would substantially increase the reliability of the result .",
    "there is a more subtle , but important point .",
    "mvcs provide the spectrum of solenoidal motions given by @xmath23 , while vca is sensitive to both potential and solenoidal motions .",
    "this may be used to get both potential and solenoidal motions in order to estimate the role of compressibility .",
    "in addition , because the thermal velocity acts in the vca analysis the same way as the thickness of the channel maps , measurements of the spectrum with the mvcs can provide a means of estimating the thermal velocity .",
    "it is essential to combine the advantages of the techniques .",
    "our analysis of numerical data in  4 shows that the worries about the velocity centroids ( see @xcite ) although justified , may be somewhat exaggerated .    if we _ assume _ that the criterion for the use of the centroids is satisfied ( that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) is small compared to the first one ) for earlier data sets , the analysis of observational data in @xcite provides a range of power - law indexes .",
    "their results obtained with structure functions if translated into spectra are consistent with @xmath82 , where @xmath83 with a standard deviation of @xmath84 .",
    "the kolmogorov index @xmath85 falls into the range of the measured values .",
    "l1228 exhibits exactly the kolmogorov index @xmath86 as the mean value , while other low mass star forming regions l1551 and hh83 exhibit indexes close to those of shocks , i.e. @xmath87 . the giant molecular cloud regions show shallow indexes in the range of @xmath88 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it worth noting that @xcite obtained somewhat more shallow indexes that are closer to the kolmogorov value using autocorrelation functions .",
    "those may be closer to the truth as in the presence of absorption in the center of lines , minimizing the regular velocity used for individual centroids might make the results more reliable ( see also first footnote in  3 ) .",
    "repeating of the study using mvcs and taking care of the absorption effects may be advantageous .",
    "the emergence of the kolmogorov index for the compressible magnetized gas may not be so surprising .",
    "@xcite for a range of mach numbers reported the existence of distinct alfvenic , slow , and fast wave cascades .",
    "the alfvn and slow waves result in kolmogorov - type scaling .",
    "the application of the vca to small magellanic cloud @xcite resulted in the velocity spectrum consistent with those predictions .",
    "however , other researchers ( e.g. @xcite ) reported indexes that varied with the mach number of the simulations .",
    "it is clear that more theoretical and observational work is necessary .",
    "\\1 . we derived a criterion when the velocity centroids may reflect the actual underlying velocity statistics .",
    "we introduced mvcs that may recover velocity statistics from spectral line data in cases when the traditional centroid analysis fails .",
    "our numerical tests show that both the mvcs and the normalized velocity centroids ( see eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) ) successfully recover the velocity information from data cubes obtained via numerical simulations of the compressible mhd turbulence if the density spectrum is steep .",
    "mvcs and the vca are complementary independent techniques .",
    "obtaining the same power spectrum with both of them enhances confidence in the result .",
    "mvcs are most useful when turbulence is subsonic or / and does not follow the power law . additional information on the solenoidal versus potential motions , temperatures of gas etc .",
    "may be obtained combining these two techniques .",
