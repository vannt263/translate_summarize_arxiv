    "the evolution of dwarfs is a complex problem , where evolutionary paths may depend on a variety of external and internal factors .",
    "our knowledge of the local volume ( @xmath3 mpc ) has deepened , in particular due to strong efforts in determining distances to many nearby galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is still unclear what governs the evolution of dwarfs in low density regions and how the different morphological types form .    here",
    ", we present a study of the properties of dwarf galaxies over the last 3 gyr ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath4=70  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 . ] drawn from gems @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "our starting sample consists of 988 dwarfs from the gems survey in the redshift range @xmath6 ( corresponding to look - back times of 1 to 3 gyr ) , and a comparison local sample of 2847 dwarfs with @xmath7 from the nyu value - added low - redshift galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sdss , which have been identified and extracted by applying an absolute magnitude cut of @xmath8 mag .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the dwarfs in this sample have subsequently been fitted with a sersic model using galfit @xcite . finally , we limited the sample to objects with an effective surface brightness brighter than 22 mag arcsec@xmath9 in the @xmath10 band , which corresponds to the completeness limit of the sdss sample @xcite .",
    "the final sample consists of 401 dwarfs from gems and 1291 dwarfs from sdss .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the distributions of the luminosities and sersic indices .",
    "the comparison of the global colors of the two samples shows that the gems dwarfs are significantly bluer than the sdss dwarfs , which is apparent in the histograms shown in figure [ f2]a . a ks - test yields a probability of @xmath11 that the two color distributions stem from the same parent distribution . in order to examine the origin of this color difference",
    ", we compare the colors of our sample dwarfs to star formation ( sf ) models from _ starburst 99 _",
    "@xcite in figure [ f2]b .",
    "the general color difference between the two samples is consistent with the color evolution of models combining a starburst ( sb ) with continuous sf on a low level .",
    "the model tracks show rather long periods of time with roughly constant @xmath12 colors , while the @xmath13 colors are becoming significantly redder .",
    "this reddening occurs over time spans comparable to the average look - back time of the gems sample and the amount of reddening is in good agreement with the color difference between the two samples .",
    "using the rest - frame luminosity in a synthetic uv band centered on the 2800  line , we estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the dwarfs in the gems sample , assuming continuous sf over the last @xmath14 years , which is likely the case for a majority of our dwarfs . in figure",
    "[ f3]a we plot the _",
    "normalized _ sfr versus @xmath15 . in a next step",
    ", we estimate the mechanical luminosities ( mls ) needed for the complete removal of the gas from the dwarfs . the estimate is based on the blowaway model by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mls depend only on the mass , which we derive from the @xmath16-band luminosities , and the ellipticity . in figure",
    "[ f3]b we compare these mls with the ones expected for the measured sfrs .",
    "we find that for their derived sf histories , the luminous ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 mag ) dwarfs are likely to retain their gas and avoid blowaway",
    ". however , there are a fair number of low luminosity dwarfs ( @xmath19 to @xmath18 ) that are susceptible to a complete blowaway of gas , _ if they were _ to experience a sb . however , in practice , only a small fraction of these low luminosity dwarfs _ may be actually undergoing _ a sb .",
    "even though , we do not have any clear evidence that some dwarfs in our sample experience a sb at the time of observation , we are also not able to rule this out .",
    "the derived mls stem from the sfrs , which have been determined assuming that the dwarfs had a constant sfr over the last @xmath14 years .",
    "in addition , we used the near - uv luminosities , which could be affected by dust . in view of these uncertainties ,",
    "the derived sfrs have to be considered as lower limits",
