    "the frontiers of modern physics are often said to lie in two directions where no adequate theoretical description exists : micro - world ( particle physics , unified description of interactions and so on ) and mega - world ( cosmological problems ) . on the other hand , theoretical description of the familiar macro - world",
    "is considered to be largely complete .",
    "this is not quite the case : whereas solids and gases are well understood , the third state of the macro - world , the liquid state , presents serious theoretical problems .",
    "surprising though it may seem , these problems are similar to those existing in the micro - world and mega - world from the point of view of physics and mathematics .    the main problem of theoretical description of liquids is the absence of a small parameter : contrary to solids and gases , kinetic and potential energy of atoms in the liquid are comparable in magnitude . as a result , it is impossible to develop a theory of real strongly interacting liquids by starting from the gas state and turning the interaction on .",
    "it is equally impossible to develop a first - principles theory of liquids by starting from the harmonic solid and introducing anharmonicity of interactions which increase the amplitude of vibrations leading to melting because the problem of the macroscopic number of bifurcations in the non - linear many - body system is not tractable .",
    "since using the small parameter approach and perturbation theory is the main method of theoretical physics , the `` gas '' description of liquids has been most popular despite its inadequacy . yet more than half a century ago j frenkel has proposed @xcite a way to avoid infinitely complex mathematical problems involved in constructing a theory of liquids .",
    "he asserted that the motion of atoms in a liquid consists of almost harmonic oscillations as in the solid and fairly rare jumps of atoms between different adjacent equilibrium positions .",
    "the average time between these jumps is liquid relaxation time , @xmath4 . calculating @xmath4 from first principles",
    "still remains an impossible task , but if we obtain @xmath4 from another experiment or computer simulation we are able to derive and explain most important liquid properties . in the last few years , we have used this approach to construct a thermodynamic theory of liquids in the wide range of parameters and explain excitation spectra and other physical properties of liquids @xcite .",
    "below we discuss how this approach can be applied to strong interactions in field theories and elementary particles .    in field theories ,",
    "interactions are introduced to free field hamiltonians to describe the processes of production of new particles , calculate their cross - sections as well as discuss interactions between different types of fundamental forces @xcite .",
    "problems related to divergences and infinities originating in perturbation theories of interactions have been raised at the early stages of development of field theories @xcite , stimulating new ideas , tour - de - force calculations as well as deeper philosophical issues @xcite . the problem of divergences and divergent perturbation series remains profound and fundamental @xcite .",
    "notably , the treatment of interactions in field theories has been based on the premise that the only way of treating interaction terms is by using the perturbation theory ( see , for example , p. 200 in ref .",
    "the divergences arising in perturbation expansions are therefore viewed as a common necessity @xcite .    alongside with the mainstream perturbative approaches , non - perturbative aspects of quantum field theory were explored and discussed , including the problems involving strong interactions , or strong coupling ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . these and other ideas were aimed , among other things , at finding ways around divergences and non - renormalizabilities of various types , and were successful in some respects but not in others @xcite .    here , we propose a new way of treating interactions that does not involve perturbation expansions and associated divergences .",
    "the new effective non - perturbative description is inspired by our recent theory of strongly - interacting liquids based on frenkel reduction and relaxation time @xmath4 @xcite .    in the next two chapters ,",
    "we review our recent theory of strongly interacting liquids and discuss the implications of these results for the first - principles hamiltonian approaches .",
    "we subsequently show the equivalence of hamiltonians describing strongly interacting liquids and interacting fields , enabling us to apply the recent theory of liquids to interacting fields .",
    "this specific proposal continues a more general trend of cross - fertilization between condensed matter physics and field theory ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this approach ,",
    "the motion of the field consists of oscillations in one harmonic well and hopping between different wells .",
    "this motion results in the disappearance of ( @xmath5 - 1 ) modes with frequency smaller than the frenkel frequency @xmath6 , similarly to the loss of two transverse modes in a liquid with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "we illustrate the proposed programme with the calculation of the energy and propagator of the strongly - interacting field , and show that the results can not be obtained in perturbation theory to any finite order .",
    "importantly , the frenkel energy gap for transverse modes , @xmath3 and associated massive frenkel particle naturally appear in our consideration , the result that is relevant for current efforts to demonstrate a mass gap in interacting field theories such as yang - mills theory .",
    "notably , our mechanism involves a physically sensible starting point in terms of real masses ( frequencies ) in the harmonic non - interacting field , in contrast to the higgs effect involving the imaginary mass as a starting point .",
    "we further note that the longitudinal mode remains gapless , implying that both short - range and long - range forces with massive and massless particles naturally emerge and unify in a single interacting field , a result not hitherto anticipated .",
    "heat capacity of matter is widely perceived to be one of its main important properties because it informs a scientist about the degrees of freedom available in the system .",
    "heat capacity is well understood in gases and solids but not in the third state of matter , the liquid state , despite over a century of intensive research .    in an amusing story about his teaching experience",
    ", granato recalls living in fear about a potential student question about liquid heat capacity @xcite .",
    "observing that the question was never asked by a total of 10000 students , granato proposes that `` ... an important deficiency in our standard teaching method is a failure to mention sufficiently the unsolved problems in physics . indeed , there is nothing said about liquids [ heat capacity ] in the standard introductory textbooks , and little or nothing in advanced texts as well .",
    "in fact , there is little general awareness even of what the basic experimental facts to be explained are . ''",
    "granato s observation is supported by the absence of a discussion of liquid specific heat in classic statistical physics textbooks as well as texts dedicated to liquids and other disordered systems @xcite ) .",
    "perturbation approaches do not apply to real liquids because neither interactions nor virial parameter , or density , are small .",
    "for example , the specific heat of the van der waals system with added interactions is @xmath7 @xcite , as in the ideal gas . due to the absence of a small parameter",
    ", perturbation approaches have not been considered as serious attempts to explain thermodynamic properties of real strongly - interacting liquids .",
    "the absence of a small parameter was , in landau view , the fundamental property of liquids that ultimately precluded the construction of a theory of liquids at the same level existing for solids or gases . in a similarly discouraging spirit ,",
    "landau and lifshitz statistical physics textbook states twice that strong interactions , combined with system - specific form of interactions , imply that liquid energy is strongly system - dependent , precluding the calculation of energy and other properties in general form , contrary to solids or gases @xcite .",
    "we note that strong interactions are successfully treated in solids in the phonon approach where the small parameter is atomic displacements and where a harmonic approximation to the energy is often a good approximation .",
    "this approach has long been thought to be inapplicable to liquids where atomic displacements are large . as a result ,",
    "liquids have been thought to have no small parameter that immensely simplifies matters in solids and gases : in liquids displacements are large and interactions are strong at the same time .",
    "we have recently proposed a way out of this seemingly hopeless situation by putting forward a non - perturbative phonon theory of liquids @xcite . here and below , by a `` non - perturbative '' approach we generally mean an approach that does not involve perturbation theory and expansions in terms of interaction , with reference to both liquids and interacting fields .",
    "our approach is based on the concept of liquid relaxation time introduced by j. frenkel @xcite .",
    "frenkel realized that in order to make progress , in particular in rationalizing the emerging experimental data at his time , one needs to move away from first - principles hamiltonians that offered no way of solution for the reasons above , including those articulated by landau . with a remarkable physical insight ,",
    "frenkel introduced liquid relaxation time @xmath4 as the average time between particle jumps at one point in space in a liquid , and subsequently showed that @xmath4 is related to liquid viscosity @xmath8 via the maxwell relationship @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the instantaneous shear modulus .    in the frenkel picture ,",
    "molecular dynamics in liquids consists of two types : solid - like oscillations around quasi - equilibrium positions and ballistic jumps between these positions taking place with a time period of @xmath4 , the picture that has been subsequently confirmed in numerous experimental and modeling studies .",
    "@xmath4 depends on liquid structure and interactions in a very complicated way , with arguably no feasible way of calculating it in a general case .",
    "this is because @xmath4 is governed by the activation barriers in the energy landscape which becomes intractably complex for a many - body system with arbitrary types of interactions and structural correlations .",
    "however , frenkel s idea was that such a calculation is not required in order to understand the most basic features of liquid behavior .",
    "lets start with the ability of liquids to maintain solid - like shear modes .    at times shorter than @xmath4 ,",
    "a liquid is a solid , and therefore supports one longitudinal mode and two transverse modes . at times longer than @xmath4 , liquid flows and loses its ability to support solid - like transverse ( shear ) modes , and supports one longitudinal mode only as any elastic medium .",
    "this is equivalent to asserting that the only difference between a solid glass and a liquid is that a liquid does not support all solid - like transverse modes as the solid glass does , but only those with high frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the longitudinal mode is unaffected in this picture : regardless of the flow , a liquid supports fluctuations of density as any elastic medium . in a dense liquid , these fluctuations extend to wavelengths comparable with the shortest interatomic separation as discussed below . the only modification that the flow process introduces to the longitudinal mode",
    "is that dissipation laws ( namely , propagation ranges of harmonic waves ) are different in the regimes @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "derived on purely theoretical grounds , frenkel s idea was later experimentally confirmed , although with a significant time lag for high - frequency phonons that give the largest contribution to the energy .",
    "the ability of liquids to support solid - like collective modes with wavelengths extending to the shortest distance comparable to interatomic separations has been widely ascertained experimentally on the basis measured dispersion curves @xcite .",
    "this includes shear modes in both highly - viscous @xcite and low - viscous liquids such as na , ga , water and so on @xcite . notably , most of this experimental evidence is fairly recent , and has started to come to the fore only when powerful synchrotron radiation sources started to be deployed , some 5060 years after frenkel s prediction .",
    "this long - lived absence of experimental data about propagating collective excitations in liquids may have contributed to their poor understanding from the theoretical point of view ( see the recent review of this subject in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in our solid - like approach to liquid thermodynamics",
    "@xcite , we have taken up frenkel s idea about liquid vibrational states and its ability to support high - frequency shear modes .",
    "the absence of two shear modes with frequency @xmath12 is equivalent to the potential energy of restoring forces for these modes becoming zero . adding the energy of one longitudinal mode and the energy of diffusing atoms gives the liquid energy as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is total kinetic energy that includes both oscillatory and ballistic components from jumping atoms ( @xmath15 per particle in the classical case ) , @xmath16 is the potential energy of the longitudinal mode , @xmath17 is the potential energy of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath18 , and we introduced the frenkel frequency @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath19 can be re - written in the form convenient for further calculations using the virial theorem , giving @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the energy of the longitudinal mode and @xmath22 is the energy of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ len1 ] ) ensures that the loss of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath2 is accompanied by the reduction of their potential energy only ( as eq .",
    "( [ len ] ) requires ) , but not by the reduction of the total kinetic energy of the system @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ len1 ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , where @xmath27 is debye frequency ( the largest oscillation frequency present in the system ) , @xmath28 ( here and below , @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are densities of states of longitudinal and transverse modes per atom , respectively : @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the recent review of the application of debye model to liquids ) .",
    "this gives the energy per particle in the classical case as @xcite :    @xmath34    and in the quantum case as @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the zero - point energy , @xmath37 is debye function and where we omitted the anharmonic effects related to frequency softening .    the first term in brackets in eqs .",
    "( [ class],[enf ] ) is the familiar vibrational energy of the classical and quantum solid , respectively . the second term in eqs .",
    "( [ class],[enf ] ) describes the progressive loss of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath38 on temperature increase in the liquid .",
    "( [ class],[enf ] ) provide a relationship between the liquid energy and @xmath1 which can be calculated as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the infinite shear modulus and viscosity @xmath8 can be taken from independent experimental data .",
    "we have found that the calculated specific heat @xmath41 agrees reassuringly well with experimental data for 21 noble , metallic , molecular and network liquids in a wide range of temperature and pressure using no free fitting parameters @xcite . in figure [ cv3 ]",
    "we show experimental and calculated @xmath42 for systems representing three different classes of metallic , molecular and noble liquids .",
    "we observe that liquid @xmath42 decreases from approximately 3 at low temperature to 2 at high , the effect related to the progressive loss of two transverse modes with frequency @xmath38 on temperature increase @xcite .    at high temperature when @xmath43 , all transverse modes in the liquid are lost , giving @xmath44 according to eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) . at this point",
    ", atomic dynamics undergoes an important crossover from the oscillatory - ballistic as in a liquid to the purely ballistic as in a gas .",
    "we have recently proposed that this crossover defines a new line on a phase diagram @xcite , the `` frenkel '' line , crossing which results in qualitative changes of most important physical properties of the system , including diffusion , viscosity , speed of sound , thermal conductivity and , more recently , specific heat @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by making an important general assertion about liquid @xmath42 in the regime @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the shortest , debye , vibration period of about 0.1 ps .",
    "as recently discussed @xcite , it can be rigorously shown that in this regime , liquid energy and specific heat are , to a very good approximation , equal to those in the solid , and that this result is consistent with liquid entropy exceeding solid entropy .",
    "this result is also obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ class ] ) and ( [ enf ] ) : liquid energy and specific heat are equal to their solid - state values unless @xmath47 .",
    "this picture therefore predicts that liquid @xmath42 in this regime is equal to the dulong - petit value ( corrected for the effects of anharmonicity ) : @xmath48 , consistent with experimental results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and figure 1 ) .",
    "for practical purposes , @xmath45 ( or @xmath49 ) holds starting from @xmath50 .",
    "perhaps not widely recognized , the condition @xmath51 holds even for low - viscous liquids such a liquid monatomic metals ( hg , na , rb and so on ) and noble liquids such as ar near their melting points @xcite , let alone for more viscous liquids such as room - temperature olive or motor oil , honey and so on .",
    "importantly , the condition @xmath50 corresponds to almost the entire range of @xmath4 at which liquids exist , the fact that was not appreciated in earlier work on liquids .",
    "indeed , on lowering the temperature , @xmath4 increases from its smallest limiting value of @xmath52 ps to @xmath53 s where , by definition , a liquid forms a glass at the glass transition temperature . here , @xmath4 changes by 16 orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath45 applies in the range @xmath54 s , spanning 15 orders of magnitude of @xmath4 .",
    "this constitutes almost entire range of @xmath4 where liquids exist as such .",
    "we now discuss and interpret the result of the previous section in terms of the first - principles hamiltonian of the problem .",
    "as envisaged by frenkel , the energy of the liquid consists of solid - like oscillatory motion around quasi - equilibrium positions interrupted by ballistic jumps after time @xmath4 .",
    "this motion is described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 runs over the sites of topologically disordered liquid structure .",
    "the first two terms represent the familiar harmonic hamiltonian giving the oscillatory motion .",
    "the last term is responsible for atomic jumps in the liquid once @xmath57 has a form with two or more minima ( see fig .",
    "@xmath57 can be generally represented by any smooth function of @xmath58 including the polynomial function , with a general requirement that such a function has a set of minima closely located in energy and separated by distances @xmath59 comparable to interatomic separations and a characteristic value of activation barrier @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath60 is completely defined by the function @xmath57 and its parameters .",
    "then , the activated jumps over barrier @xmath60 in the classical liquid set the value of frenkel relaxation time @xmath4 as    @xmath61    we therefore find that hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) describes liquid dynamics envisaged by frenkel that includes oscillatory motion in one potential well and atomic jumps between adjacent wells with a period @xmath4 .",
    "the simplest analytical forms of @xmath57 commonly considered include two higher powers of @xmath58 :    @xmath62    expansions similar to ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) have been commonly used to model weak anharmonicity of interatomic interactions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , the important assumption was the smallness of @xmath57 , and corrections to the energy have been derived using the perturbation theory .",
    "a notable implication of the smallness of anharmonicity in this treatment is that @xmath57 does not result in large atomic jumps between two possible minima of potential ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) as is the case in liquids . even with these simplifying assumptions , perturbative treatments of interaction ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) involved extensive calculations which have nevertheless left several important open questions in the area @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 in hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) is introduced to have the diagonal form because it straightforwardly endows the atoms with the possibility to jump between neighbouring positions during time @xmath4 as envisaged by frenkel ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to each atom moving in an external potential @xmath57 , whereas in reality @xmath57 is set by the interactions between atoms that depend on relative distance between the atoms , @xmath63 , as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) does .",
    "hence @xmath64 should contain non - diagonal higher powers such as @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xcite and so on .",
    "it will become apparent below that our main conclusion of the identity between the liquid hamiltonian and interacting - field hamiltonian does not depend on whether @xmath57 retains its current diagonal form in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) or depends on the cross product of different @xmath67 .    it has proved impossible to calculate thermodynamic properties of general hamiltonians such as ( [ hamilt ] ) directly , by evaluating the partition function .",
    "perturbative approaches such as those used to treat weak anharmonicity are not justified for real strongly - interacting liquids and for this reason have not been contemplated in the literature .",
    "interestingly , this is in stark contrast to field theories where the perturbation approach has been the sole method of handling interactions , with infinite divergent series emergent @xcite . even if the direct calculation involving the explicit treatment of @xmath57 of liquid hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) were possible , the results will be strongly dependent on @xmath57 ( i.e. system - dependent as discussed by landau above ) , making the task of deriving general results for liquids seemingly hopeless .",
    "yet this is not the main problem with attempting to directly evaluate the partition function with hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) .    in our view",
    ", the main problem with direct evaluation of the partition function based on hamiltonians such as ( [ hamilt ] ) is that the problem is largely under - specified , with no currently feasible general way of treating the ensuing complexity . indeed , depending on the interaction term @xmath57 and its parameters , hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) can describe a dense strongly - interacting gas with ballistic motions only @xcite , a liquid with both oscillations and ballistic jumps in between , or a solid with only weak anharmonicity of interactions where atomic jumps are so rare that they only occur at astronomical times and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "it is challenging to assert _ a priori _ which state of matter we are dealing with ( [ hamilt ] ) because the answer depends on characteristic heights of activation barriers in a complex energy landscape of the problem , and calculating such a landscape for a general interacting many - body system is currently impossible .",
    "this is often illustrated as a story of some best physicists who are gathered on an island , asked to find the liquid state on the basis of given hamiltonian and failing to find the liquid state despite being surrounded by water @xcite .",
    "liquids therefore present an interesting and fundamental challenge of calculating the partition function on the basis of first - principles hamiltonians , the challenge which is ultimately related to a complexity of the energy landscape which is not generally known .",
    "this problem is related to the deeper issue in statistical physics , that of performing calculations in restricted versus full phase space , including finding ways of accounting for important metastable states @xcite .",
    "the problem is partially avoided by using simple model hamiltonians that restrict the phase space as , for example , the harmonic hamiltonian of a solid does .    the main idea behind our recent theory of liquids @xcite is to move away from attempting to solve first - principle hamiltonians .",
    "instead , we are operating in terms of @xmath4 as the main physical property of the liquid that enables one to separate the atomic motion into oscillatory and jump motions @xcite .",
    "this has provided an enormous reduction of the problem ( we call it `` frenkel reduction '' ) because @xmath4 encompasses the physically relevant and important features of the unknown complex energy landscape . in this approach , we have been able to discuss liquid vibrational states , derive the final equation for the liquid energy , eq .",
    "( [ enf ] ) , and ascertain its agreement with experimental data .",
    "importantly , frenkel reduction in terms of @xmath4 is applicable to any interacting non - linear system of many agents , which is intractable in general .",
    "the system of two coupled anharmonic oscillators with simple model forms of anharmonicity can be solved exactly , with the result that hopping between different equilibrium positions emerges as a result of a set of bifurcations @xcite . the barrier height @xmath60 ( and hence @xmath4 in the case of thermal motion )",
    "can be related to the non - linearity parameters .",
    "this constitutes an important first - principles proof that hopping emerges as a result of bifurcations in the non - linear system .",
    "unfortunately , increasing the number of agents or altering the simple analytical form of non - linearity makes the analysis impossible even using approximate schemes @xcite .",
    "yet frenkel reduction offers an important way in to analyze most important properties of the system as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we now demonstrate the equivalence of liquid and interacting field hamiltonians .",
    "this will enable us to apply the results derived for liquids in the previous section to interacting fields .",
    "lets consider field @xmath68 whose energy can be represented by a set of independent harmonic oscillators ( normal modes ) with frequencies @xmath69 as is the case for , for example , klein - gordon field .",
    "below we consider @xmath5-component field and @xmath70 in particular to continue the analogy with liquids .",
    "we now add the `` interaction '' term @xmath71 to the field hamiltonian density , @xmath72 , to arrive at the most common model of an interacting field @xcite :    @xmath73    we note that in condensed matter theory , `` interaction '' refers to interatomic forces , and includes both quadratic and higher anharmonic terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "strong interactions in liquids imply that both of these terms are not small compared to temperature : large quadratic terms imply that interatomic forces in liquids are as strong as in solids , and large anharmonic terms imply that these terms are not small compared to the quadratic terms , resulting in atomic hopping and liquid flow ( as opposed to serving to merely modify the spectrum of a solid system due to anharmonicity ) . in field theories , `` interaction '' refers to terms higher than quadratic such as @xmath71 in eq .",
