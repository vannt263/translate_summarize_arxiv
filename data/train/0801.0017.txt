    "masers observed in the 1720mhz satellite line of oh are often associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "they originate in the shocked region where the expanding snr collides with a molecular cloud . during the collision",
    ", a non - dissociative c - type shock can produce the temperature and density conditions required for 1720mhz maser emission to occur @xcite .",
    "the c - type shock model requires shock speeds of the order of 25 kms@xmath0 , and shock chemistry predicts the conditions to be right for masers behind the shock wave .",
    "such velocities and spatial positions are in good agreement with previous observations of snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a natural",
    ", next step would be to perform very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observations to measure the physical sizes of the masing regions , and to track the snr expansion with time .",
    "however , a major hurdle at 1720mhz is the angular broadening due to interstellar scattering .",
    "for example , in the direction of the galactic center , pronounced scattering ( @xmath1 mas at 1.6ghz ) has been measured @xcite . to overcome this problem , @xcite conducted merlin and vlba observations of the 1720mhz masers in ic443 , positioned at a galactic longitude believed to be little affected by scattering .",
    "in another project , @xcite used a nearby pulsar to estimate the interstellar scattering effect close to w28 .    a more general method that could work at any position on the sky",
    "would be using higher frequency transitions tracing the same type of gas ( shocked by the snr / cloud collisions ) .",
    "higher frequency masers are less susceptible to scattering effects , which scale as @xmath2 .",
    "finding higher frequency lines would be particularly interesting for the sgraeast region , since some 1720mhz masers found here have velocities very offset from what is expected in the snr model @xcite .",
    "these offset velocity masers coincide on the sky with the circumnuclear disk and might therefore arise under different conditions .",
    "proper motion studies of masers in the sgra complex would thus indicate whether the kinematics really differ for the offset velocity masers and the sgraeast masers .",
    "higher frequency excited - state oh masers thus could be used for astrometric and proper motion vlbi studies along the heavily scattered galactic plane and in the galactic center .",
    "modeling of the three lower rotational states of oh has demonstrated that in star forming regions ( sfrs ) satellite line 1720 and 4765mhz , and mainline 6035mhz masers can occur under similar conditions in regions of shocked gas @xcite .",
    "the 4765 and 6035mhz masers become more significant at increased column densities where the 1720mhz masers begin to switch off .",
    "detection of excited - state oh maser emission could therefore serve as a probe of regions of higher oh column densities in snrs ( @xmath3@xmath4 instead of @xmath5@xmath4 for the 1720mhz masers ) .",
    "however , calculations of the @xmath6 resulting from c - type shocks are only able to produce relatively low values , @xmath7@xmath4 @xcite which may be a limiting factor in the formation of excited - state oh masers in snrs .",
    "it should be noted that detailed observations of oh and h@xmath8o in ic443 require an oh production scenario involving both j- and c - type shocks @xcite , indicating that estimating the oh column density could be more complicated than previously thought .    in this work we present the details and results of our search for higher frequency oh transitions in snrs with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we also report on the results of a literature search for collisionally excited 1612mhz masers associated with snrs .",

    "four well studied snrs with strong 1720mhz masers ( ranging from at least 2.5 to 70 jy ) were selected ( w44 , w28 , ic443 and sgraeast ) . under project",

    "the most straightforward explanation of the absence of detectable excited - state oh maser emission in snrs is that highest column density peaks produce the 1720mhz masers but are not high enough to generate maser emission in any other transition .",
    "we note that the search presented here is biased toward regions with existing 1720mhz masers , and could thus be biased against regions with the higher column densities needed for the excited - state oh ( fig.[offer ] ) .",
    "estimates of the oh column densities are available via thermal absorption in the ground state transitions of oh , when sufficient background continuum emission is present . absorption of 1667mhz oh in w28 implies @xmath51@xmath4 , for an adopted excitation temperature @xmath52 of 10k @xcite , indicating low column densities with little possible inversion of the excited - state oh ( fig .

    "our non - detections are , however , consistent with regions of lower column densities , where 1720mhz masers are strong , and little or no inversion has occurred in the higher transitions .      an alternative explanation to the absence of excited - state oh masers could be that the density or temperature is too high .",
    "models of 1720mhz emission imply that the optimal post - shock density in which 1720mhz masers occur is of the order @xmath57@xmath20 , with temperatures @xmath58k @xcite .",
    "millimeter observations of multiple molecular lines in ic443 suggest that there may be regions of much higher temperature and density in snrs .",
    "in particular , in ic443 , the 1720mhz masers occur within the ic443 cloud complex g @xcite . from the millimeter data ,",
    "the medium in this clump appears to fit a two - component model with both a cool , low - density ( @xmath59k , @xmath60@xmath20 ) component , and a warmer , higher density ( @xmath61k , @xmath62@xmath20 ) component @xcite .",
    "similar numbers were derived by @xcite . at densities of the order of @xmath63@xmath20 , but with lower temperature ( @xmath64k ) , previous modeling has already shown that the 1720mhz transition may still be weakly inverted @xcite .    here we calculate the expected maser optical depths in a warmer , higher density region , again using molpop assuming thermal line - widths , @xmath65k , and @xmath66@xmath20 , we achieve the results shown in figure [ mpdense ] .",
    "as expected , the 1720mhz line is quenched at this higher density .",
    "the 4765mhz transition is only modestly inverted with maser optical depths of the order of 0.51 at column densities @xmath67@xmath20 .",
    "even weaker inversion is seen in the 6049mhz line .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the molecular medium is commonly composed of two components like those in ic443 , the 1720mhz masers must be associated with the cooler , lower - density component",
    ". a warmer component will not be able to produce excited - state oh masers , and as a consequence , we conclude that it is not the density that primarily constrains the formation of excited - state oh .",
    "we note that at higher densities , the model predicts a strong maser line in the 1612mhz transition ( fig .",
    "[ mpdense ] ) .",
    "however , 1612mhz masers in general are not correlated with snrs ( sect .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , 1612mhz emission can also originate from the interaction of a snr and its surrounding ism ( sect.[coll1612 ] ; fig .",
    "[ mpdense ] ) .",
    "we therefore turned to the list of double peaked 1612mhz masers found by @xcite , where some maser sources are attributed to the @xmath950kms@xmath0 molecular cloud ( mc ) .",
    "the individual mc spectra shown may not represent the true emission ( and absorption ) in the cloud , nor be complete for emission of the cloud ( e.g. , see the `` maxmap '' in their fig .",
    "8) as the data reduction and search were focused on finding double peaked oh / ir stars .",
    "however , their mc list does partly represent compact 1612mhz emission , either thermal or low - gain masing not attributed to stars , and therefore is relevant in this respect .    in fig .",
    "[ sgraeast ] we plot the locations of the pure mc 1612mhz emission ( circles ) from @xcite on top of the 1720mhz snr masers ( crosses ) and 1.7ghz radio continuum ( grey scale ) taken from @xcite .",
    "the following observations can be made :    * all regions of 1612mhz emission have one or more peaks in the v@xmath68 range of 30 to 70 kms@xmath0 , i.e. , closely following the v@xmath68 gradient over , and range of the @xmath950kms@xmath0 molecular cloud . *",
    "the 1612mhz emission avoids regions of 1720mhz emission ( the closest possible association is about 0.5pc in projection ) , which is to be expected as a reflection of column density differences ( figs .",
    "[ offer ] & [ mpdense ] ) . *",
    "the 1612mhz emission is co - located with the radio continuum outlining the snr , but not on top of the regions of the strongest radio continuum emission . *",
    "no 1612mhz emission is seen near the compact regions in the east and south : i.e. , the 1612mhz emission is probably not related to sfrs .",
    "we note that no 4765mhz emission ( this work ) nor 6049mhz emission @xcite is detected toward sgraeast , so there does not exist a continuous density gradient where the 1720 , 6049 , 4765 and then 1612mhz transitions , respectively , are purely collisionally pumped . based on these data , we are not able to determine whether the 1612mhz emission is purely thermal emission from the cloud",
    ". it could also be pumped by the interstellar radiation field and perhaps amplifying the background radio continuum , or indeed collisionally pumped stimulated emission resulting from the reverse shock in the snr . to address these questions in the galactic center ( gc )",
    ", a more specific observational setup will be required to properly account for details like , for example , missing zero - spacing flux .",
    "as the gc is a special case , it is beyond the scope of this paper . pending a more detailed analysis of the gc region",
    "we therefore assume that there generally is no collisionally excited 1612mhz emission due to snr / mc interactions , with a possible exception in the gc .",
    "for oh column densities @xmath69 @xmath4 , models of collisionally - pumped excited - state oh in snrs predict inversions in the 1720 , 4765 and 6049mhz lines , while no significant maser optical depths will be produced in other transitions of the 4.7 , 7.8 , 8.2 and 23.8ghz lines .",
    "we have presented the results from a search of all these excited - state oh transitions in four , well - known snrs , with no detections .",
    "these vla observations could not tune to the 6049mhz line , which is also predicted to have large optical depths under conditions similar to those of 1720mhz masers .",
    "however , a few recent searches for the 6049mhz line in snrs have yielded no detections @xcite . in the future",
    ", the evla upgrade will allow for a targeted , deeper search for 6049mhz in these snrs .",
    "our non - detections are consistent with regions of lower column densities ( @xmath70@xmath4 ) , where 1720mhz masers are strong , and little inversion occurs in the higher transitions . based on vla and single - dish observations by @xcite & @xcite , such a post - shock medium may have a large filling factor .",
    "@xcite found that a large part of the 1720mhz maser flux is undetected using vla baselines , indicating a widespread distribution of weaker 1720mhz emission .",
    "this likely reflects large post - shock regions of low column density , or alternatively , regions of different temperature and density from what is normally expected for 1720mhz maser production . in turn",
    ", such a gas component will provide little chance of excited - state oh maser emission . if this is the case , excited - state oh will not be detected either coincident with or offset from detected 1720mhz masers in snrs .",
    "the non - detections imply a low oh column density in snrs , in agreement with the rather low estimates of the @xmath71@xmath4 expected to be produced in c - type shocks @xcite .    from these results we draw the conclusion that in the regions where 1720mhz masers are found , the oh column densities are insufficient for excited - state oh masers to exist .",
    "this is supported by the absence of 1612mhz masers in snrs , which require 12 orders of magnitude higher column densities than the 1720mhz masers .",
    "however , the upper limit to the column density must be even stricter to avoid producing 6049 and 4765mhz masers .",

    "<S> no probable associations were found , perhaps except in the sgraeast region . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of detections of excited - state oh indicates that the oh column densities suffice for 1720mhz inversion but not for inversion of excited - state transitions , consistent with the expected results for c - type shocks . </S>"
