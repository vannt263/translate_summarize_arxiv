    "the remainder of this introduction provides a summary of the approach and discusses its relationship with other works .      in a series of papers published in the soviet union during the 1950 s",
    ", m. g. krein made a detailed study of the existence of spectral expansions associated with the vibrating string equation .",
    "for some useful accounts of this work in the english language , see @xcite ; in particular , @xcite contains a rough outline of the historical development of krein s ideas and their overlap with the work of feller aimed at a unified analytical treatment of some discrete and continuous stochastic processes .",
    "denote by @xmath20 the set of functions @xmath21 \\rightarrow [ 0,\\infty]$ ] that are non - decreasing , right - continuous and infinite at infinity .",
    "we use the convention @xmath22 so that @xmath23 is a well - defined stieltjes measure .",
    "the tying constant @xmath24 is absorbed in the definition of @xmath8 by setting @xmath25 for such @xmath8 , krein gave a precise meaning to equation ( [ stringequation ] ) and its particular solutions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "with a slight abuse of terminology , we shall identify @xmath8 with the string .",
    "krein showed that the characteristic function defined by equation ( [ characteristicfunction ] ) is necessarily of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a right - continuous non - decreasing function with support in @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the paramater @xmath32 is in fact the infimum of the points of increase of @xmath8 , and the function @xmath28 in this representation is called the _ principal spectral function _ of the string .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath33 the set of _ all _ functions expressible in this form .",
    "hence krein showed that @xmath34 for every @xmath35 .",
    "he also conjectured the converse : _ every _ element of @xmath33 is the characteristic function of a unique string in @xmath20 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first proof of this conjecture was given in @xcite , chapter 6 ; it uses the theory of hilbert spaces of entire functions , and a deep uniqueness theorem due to de branges .",
    "although there is no known systematic procedure for solving krein s inverse problem in its full generality , effective algorithms do exist if the mass distribution belongs to certain special classes .",
    "for instance , if @xmath8 is smooth , then the change of variables @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inverse of @xmath38 , transforms the string equation into @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the so - called impedance . the inverse problem for this equation",
    "may be tackled by `` integral operator '' techniques going back to the works of gelfand , krein , levitan and marchenko ; see @xcite for an informal account of these techniques and their historical background , and @xcite for more recent developments .",
    "general methods inspired by the gelfand ",
    "levitan approach aimed at solving the inverse problem for the string equation have been considered by dym & kravitsky @xcite , winkler @xcite and boumenir @xcite .",
    "another class for which the inverse problem is tractable arises in connection with _ stieltjes moment problem _ @xcite : given a sequence of numbers @xmath42 , find a measure @xmath43 on @xmath44 such that @xmath45 briefly , stieltjes approach was to construct from the @xmath46 a certain continued fraction , namely @xmath47 stieltjes gave an algorithm that permits the calculation of the @xmath48 from the @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 thus obtained form a finite or infinite sequence of strictly positive numbers , depending on whether the measure @xmath28 has finitely or infinitely many points of growth .",
    "stieltjes distinguished the _ determinate _ case , in which the moment problem has a unique solution , and its complement , the _ indeterminate _ case .",
    "the determinate case arises if and only if the continued fraction either terminates ( i.e. the sequence of the @xmath48 is finite ) or else is infinite but convergent .",
    "the continued fraction is then a well - defined function of @xmath5 which may be expressed as the stieltjes transform of the sought measure @xmath28 .",
    "stieltjes also found a beautifully simple criterion for the convergence of the continued fraction when the sequence of the @xmath48 is infinite ; he showed that convergence occurs if and only if @xmath50    this work on the moment problem provided the inspiration for krein s own theory of strings ; see supplement ii in @xcite . with remarkable insight , krein was able to relate stieltjes continued fraction to the characteristic function of a _ discrete _ string , i.e. a string made up of a sequence of point masses @xmath51 at the positions @xmath52 . to see how , set @xmath53 the string equation then yields a riccati equation for @xmath54 : @xmath55 for a string consisting of point masses , @xmath56 is a linear combination of dirac deltas ; at a point @xmath52 with concentrated mass @xmath51 , this riccati equation should be interpreted as @xmath57 by using equation ( [ weylfunction ] ) , we find @xmath58 and , by iterating , @xmath59 if the principal spectral function has finitely many points of increase , then the string consists of finitely many , say @xmath60 , point masses with finite mass ( and a further point of infinite mass at @xmath24 ) .",
    "then @xmath61 , the expansion terminates , and we have the finite case of stieltjes continued fraction ( [ stieltjescontinuedfraction ] ) .",
    "if the principal spectral function has infinitely many points of increase , then there are infinitely many point masses ; the continued fraction does not terminate but its coefficients obviously still determine @xmath2 for every @xmath0 such that @xmath62 in particular , if @xmath63 then the continued fraction converges and the string is _ completely _ determined by its coefficients since either @xmath64 or else @xmath65 .",
    "let us now elaborate the significance of the foregoing remarks for krein s inverse problem . define @xmath66 and denote by @xmath41 the corresponding set of strings .",
    "every @xmath67 may be expanded in a continued fraction of the form ( [ kreinexpansion ] ) , and the coefficients in the expansion may be computed from the moments of the principal spectral function @xmath28 .",
    "it will serve our purpose to abuse stieltjes terminology somewhat by saying that @xmath18 itself belongs to the _ determinate subclass _ of @xmath68 if the continued fraction is either finite or convergent , and to the _ indeterminate subclass _ otherwise .",
    "it follows , then , that stieltjes continued fraction provides an effective solution method of the inverse problem for strings in @xmath41 whose characteristic functions are in the determinate subclass .",
    "not every member of @xmath41 is a discrete string ; all that can be said is that such strings must begin with a sequence of point masses ; see @xcite ,  5.9 .",
    "if @xmath67 is in the determinate subclass , then @xmath8 is a discrete string .",
    "the converse is of course not true , and for a discrete string whose characteristic function is in the indeterminate subclass , one can not recover the tying constant from the continued fraction coefficients alone ; see @xcite ,  13 .",
    "[ discreteremark ]      the connection between discrete strings and continued fractions can be exploited to provide a reconstruction algorithm of greater applicability .",
    "beals use this idea in the context of integrable systems @xcite ; borcea use it as the basis of their numerical treatment of the inverse sturm  liouville problem in impedance form @xcite .",
    "the practical issue that arises is how to find approximations of the spectral data that satisfy stieltjes moment condition and have explicitly computable moments .",
    "both beals and borcea resolve this issue by restricting their attention to the case of a _ discrete spectrum _",
    ", where the characteristic function has a mittag  leffler expansion which may be truncated to furnish the required approximations .",
    "we present an alternative truncation strategy applicable to a class that includes some characteristic functions with an absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "this class is a proper subset of a class denoted @xmath69 , based on a continued fraction expansion that arises naturally in connection with krein s inverse problem .",
    "the expansion rests on the following two useful `` rules '' relating the characteristic function to its string .",
    "the first of these rules concerns the characteristic function of the right - continuous inverse @xmath70 of the string @xmath8 :    @xmath71 [ dualproposition ]    the string @xmath70 will be called the _ dual _ of @xmath8 .",
    "the second rule concerns the string obtained from @xmath8 by removing @xmath1 from the spectrum of @xmath28 :    let @xmath8 be the string with characteristic function @xmath72 then @xmath73 is the characteristic function of the string @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 ^ 2\\,\\mbox{\\em d } \\tau\\,.\\ ] ] [ zeromassproposition ]    two other useful formulae connecting @xmath18 and @xmath8 are : @xmath76 and , in the case @xmath77 , @xmath78 for proofs of these results , see @xcite ,  6.8 and  6.9 . using these rules and setting @xmath79 , we may write @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the characteristic function of the dual string , say @xmath82 , of @xmath83 . by the same argument ,",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 is the characteristic function of the dual string , say @xmath86 , of @xmath87 .",
    "iterating , we obtain @xmath88 this continued fraction , albeit in a very particular context and in a somewhat disguised form , was introduced and studied in our recent work on the excursions of diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "it is also implicit in some of the calculations carried out by donati  martin and yor in their generalisation of lvy s formula for the area enclosed by a planar brownian motion @xcite .    in  [ katssection ]",
    ", we study the relationship between this continued fraction and that of stieltjes .",
    "this relationship may be described in terms of the map @xmath89 then @xmath90 hence the class @xmath91 is the set of characteristic functions that plays , for the continued fraction ( [ katscontinuedfraction ] ) , the part played by the class @xmath68 for the continued fraction of stieltjes .",
    "we show by elementary means that the corresponding set of strings , denoted @xmath69 , consists of those strings whose _ dual _ principal spectral functions have _ negative _ moments .",
    "then , by a straightforward application of kats results on such spectral functions @xcite , we derive a simple criterion , expressed in terms of the mass distribution @xmath2 , for @xmath8 to be in the class @xmath69 .",
    "the upshot is that this class is large enough to be of interest ; in particular , it contains some strings with an absolutely continuous principal spectral function .    just as in the case of the stieltjes continued fraction , @xmath92 may be partitioned into two subclasses : determinate and indeterminate .",
    "the determinate subclass consists of all those characteristic functions for which the continued fraction expansion ( [ katscontinuedfraction ] ) is either finite or else convergent the latter case occuring if and only if equation ( [ stieltjesseries ] ) holds . ",
    "[ inversesection ] discusses the finite case .",
    "we show there that the string @xmath8 corresponding to such a characteristic function is discrete with finitely many point masses , and we devise an algorithm to compute it explicitly , given the continued fraction coefficients .",
    "the infinite ( convergent ) case may then be tackled by considering the truncations of the continued fraction after @xmath60 terms ; since krein s correspondence between strings and characteristic functions is a homeomorphism , the discrete string so obtained yields in the limit @xmath93 the solution of the inverse problem .    in  [ diffusionsection ] , we give some examples that arise in the study of the excursions of one - dimensional diffusion processes . knight @xcite and kotani & watanabe @xcite pointed out simultaneously the relevance of krein s theory to this topic : every string @xmath8 defines a _ generalised diffusion process _ , and the excursions of the process from its starting point may be described by means of the principal sprectral function of the dual string . the probabilistic version of krein s inverse problem is to find the diffusion , given the distribution of the excursion lengths .",
