    "most of the physical properties of heavy fermions can be attributed to the proximity of these systems to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite .",
    "this zero temperature critical point arises as a competition between kondo effect and magnetic order induced by rkky coupling . in the magnetically disordered side of the phase diagram a scaling approach",
    "reveals the existence of a new characteristic temperature , the _ coherence temperature _ @xmath2 , below which the system exhibits fermi liquid ( fl ) behavior @xcite . in this relation ,",
    "@xmath3 critical point and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the correlation length and dynamic critical exponents .",
    "@xmath6 is the coupling between the local moments and @xmath7 its critical value , at which the magnetic instability , characterized by the wavevector @xmath8 occurs . at the qcp ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath9 , the system does not cross the _ coherence line _ and consequently exhibits _ non - fermi liquid behavior _ down to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that the heavy fermion systems @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 under pressure ( the latter for @xmath15 @xmath16kbars ) , obey a _",
    "one - parameter scaling _ , i.e. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where these quantities are measured in the fermi liquid regime for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the coherence temperature , @xmath0 , then determines the pressure variation of the coefficient of the linear term of the specific heat , of the uniform susceptibility , the coefficient of the @xmath22 term of the resistivity and of the characteristic pseudo - metamagnetic field , respectively . in this paper",
    "we use the spin - fluctuation theory of a nearly anti - ferromagnetic metal @xcite @xcite to fully characterize this regime and calculate the specific heat , the uniform susceptibility and the resistivity in the region of the phase diagram where this type of one - parameter scaling is observed .",
    "this allows for an explicit evaluation of the _ wilson ratio _ and the _ kadowaki - woods ratio",
    "_ @xcite between the coefficient of the @xmath23 term in the resistivity and that of the linear term of the specific heat .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , although the spin fluctuation model that we use to describe the physical behavior associated with the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is a gaussian theory , this theory gives the _ exact description _ of the quantum critical behavior @xcite , i.e. , the gaussian exponents associated with the qcp are exact .",
    "the reason is that for the problem considered here , the effective dimension @xmath24 . since the euclidean dimension @xmath25 and the dynamic exponent @xmath26 , for antiferromagnetic fluctuations , @xmath27 , the upper critical dimension for the magnetic transition .",
    "consequently the gaussian fixed point yields the correct zero temperature critical exponents @xcite .",
    "we start from the expression for the free energy given by the spin - fluctuation theory of a nearly antiferromagnetic electronic system @xcite@xcite .",
    "we use the notation of ref.@xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are local parameters defined through the local dynamical susceptibility , @xmath32@xcite .",
    "@xmath33 , as before , is the @xmath34-dependent exchange coupling between @xmath35-moments and @xmath36 is the _ stiffness _ of the lifetime of the spin fluctuations defined by the small wavevector expansion of the magnetic coupling close to the wavevector @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "then , @xmath38 can be rewritten as , @xmath39 $ ] , where the correlation length , @xmath40 diverges at the critical value of the coupling , @xmath41 , with the gaussian critical exponent , @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , we have for the specific heat @xmath43 , @xmath44 where we have identified the dynamic critical exponent , @xmath45 , typical of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the argument of the @xmath46 can be written as , @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the term in brackets @xmath48 $ ] is always @xmath49 , furthermore the exponential cuts off the contribution for the integral from large values of @xmath50 , consequently for @xmath51 , we can expand the @xmath52 for small values of its arguments .",
    "it is easily seen that this condition can be written as , @xmath21 , where the _ coherence temperature _ , @xmath53 in agreement with the scaling theory , since @xmath54 ( @xmath42 and @xmath45 ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath71 _ is large , or because _ @xmath36 _  is small_. rewriting this condition as @xmath72 , it holds _ arbitrarily close _ to the qcp , i.e. , for @xmath73 arbitrarily small .",
    "table i gives values for the coherence temperature for some heavy fermion systems , which obey one parameter scaling , obtained from eq.7 and the measured specific heat .",
    "the zero temperature uniform susceptibility of the nearly antiferromagnetic system in the limit @xmath69 can be directly obtained from the magnetic field @xmath74 dependent , @xmath10 , q - independent free energy @xcite @xcite , @xmath75\\ ] ] notice that the magnetic field in this expression scales as @xmath76 where the characteristic field , @xmath20 .",
    "the uniform susceptibility @xmath77 is given by , @xmath78 where the limit @xmath79 has been taken .",
    "note from the general expression for the uniform susceptibility @xcite , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the staggered susceptibility , that in the limit , @xmath69 , @xmath82 .",
    "then the staggered and uniform susceptibilities coincide in this limit , being equally enhanced .",
    "the wilson ratio ( wr ) is given by @xmath83 which turns out to be a universal number since the dependence on the distance to the critical point , @xmath84 and on the dimensionless quantity @xmath85 cancels out .",
    "we emphasize that the above result for @xmath77 is valid in the regime , @xmath69 , that is , if the system satisfies the condition , @xmath86 .",
    "the experimental value for the wr in @xmath11 , given in table i , is in fair agreement with the theory .",
    "the same is not true for the other systems .",
    "since there is a reasonable spread on the experimental data for different samples of these materials , at this point , the best indication that they are in the sub - critical regime is the fact that they obey one - parameter scaling .",
    "the resistivity due to spin fluctuations in the regime @xmath69 is given by @xcite @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 the quantity @xmath91 is given by , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the coupling constant per unit cell between localized and conduction electrons .",

    ", it is the characteristic temperature below which the resistivity varies quadratically with temperature , as appropriate to a fl and that sets the scale for this contribution .",
    "note that there are two characteristic time scales in the problem considered here , namely @xmath108and @xmath109 . while the former vanishes in the local limit the latter may still diverge .",

    "the values of @xmath119 obtained from the experimental results and with @xmath120 , are given in table i. if we use @xmath121 , the value for @xmath122 @xcite , we get , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath126 , respectively , which are too large . on the other hand , extending the korringa relation @xcite for arbitrary spin , i.e. , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the experimental magnetic moment ( in @xmath129 ) given in table i , we get the values for @xmath130 also shown in this table ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "these values are in agreement with those expected for non - magnetic heavy fermions @xcite , although the value of @xmath131 separating the magnetic from the fermi liquid ground states in heavy fermions is still unknown .",
    "takimoto and moriya @xcite have also calculated the kadowaki - woods ratio for heavy fermions and obtained that , not too close to the qcp , it is nearly independent of @xmath71 .",
    "notice that for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and the resistivity varies linearly with temperature .",
    "it is given by , @xmath134    we point out that in the @xmath34-dependent , critical regime , i.e. , for @xmath135 , also @xmath136 , at low temperatures , but the coefficient @xmath137 @xcite and consequently does not scale as @xmath138 , in disagreement with the experimental results in the heavy fermion systems investigated here @xcite .",
    "also in the critical regime , the thermal mass , @xmath139 @xcite , as shown before , and the uniform susceptibility , @xmath140 @xcite both saturate at non - universal , cut - off dependent values @xcite , and do not scale as observed experimentally . in this critical regime",
    "these quantities are controlled by the _ stiffness _ @xmath36 . on the other hand , in the local limit , @xmath69 ,",
    "the relevant fermi liquid parameters are universal since they are independent of the cut - off @xmath141 and the stiffness @xmath36 .",
    "they are determined by the coherence temperature ( eqs.@xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) , essentially by the distance of the system to the qcp .",
    "it should be clear by now that the spin fluctuation theory of nearly antiferromagnetic systems , in the sub - critical regime @xmath145 , gives rise to the one - parameter scaling observed in the heavy fermions discussed here .",
    "we have obtained , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , as found experimentally in the pressure experiments .",
    "the heavy fermions , @xmath11 , @xmath126 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath150kbars ) are then close , _ but not too close _ , to the qcp such that they satisfy the condition @xmath145 or @xmath151 . in the phase diagram of fig.1 , they are close but to the right of the line @xmath152 , shown in this figure .",
    "note that pressure used in the experiments drives these systems further away to the right of this line where the results obtained here are valid .",
    "we have shown that the linear term of the specific heat , the uniform susceptibility and the coefficient of the @xmath23 term of the resistivity of a nearly antiferromagnetic metallic system in the fermi liquid regime , for @xmath153 , can be written in terms of the coherence temperature .",
    "the condition , @xmath145 , or @xmath154 does not imply that the system is far away from the critical point since it can be satisfied for arbitrarily small @xmath155 , for @xmath36 sufficiently small .",
    "the spin fluctuation theory in the sub - critical regime @xmath145 corresponds to a _ local interacting model _ as the correlation length may become smaller than the distance among spins .",
    "formally , this regime is equivalent to a problem in euclidean dimension @xmath156 , consistent with the local character of the model in this limit , but with effective dimensionality @xmath157 @xcite . in the local model",
    "the exponent @xmath158 , defined through @xmath159 for @xmath160 , takes the value @xmath161 as can be seen from eq.8 with @xmath162 . from the divergence of the characteristic time @xmath163 in eq.11 , which yields @xmath164 , we get that the quantum hyperscaling relation @xcite @xmath165 is indeed satisfied for @xmath156 . in spite that spatial correlations are irrelevant in this regime , time fluctuations are critically correlated due to the quantum character of the transition .    in the regime @xmath166 ,",
    "the system obeys a one - parameter scaling , i.e. , @xmath146 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , with @xmath170 , as we have shown .",
    "we can conclude that the heavy fermion systems @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for @xmath171 and @xmath14 , for @xmath150kbars , belong to a region of doniach s phase diagram where the condition , @xmath172 , is satisfied as evidenced by the one - scaling parameter observed in these materials @xcite@xcite .",
    "these systems are to the right of the line @xmath152 , in the phase diagram of fig.1 .",
    "as the quantum critical point is further approached , @xmath173 and the full @xmath34-dependence of the dynamic susceptibility must be taken into account .",
    "this critical regime has been described by takimoto and moriya @xcite , but it clearly does not yield the one - parameter scaling obtained in the pressure experiments on the systems above .    eventually for @xmath9 ,",
    "the coherence temperature vanishes and the fl regime is never reached .",

    "regime have been obtained by moriya @xcite , millis @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case the antiferromagnetic transitions at @xmath174 are described by non - gaussian exponents .",
    "in fact , although the spin - fluctuation theory gives the exact exponents of the quantum critical point , this is not the case for the finite temperature antiferromagnetic transitions which occur in the region of the kondo lattice phase diagram for @xmath175 , or @xmath176 .",
