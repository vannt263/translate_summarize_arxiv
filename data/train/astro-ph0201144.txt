    "ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources are characterized by a simple convex radio spectrum with a peak at ghz frequencies .",
    "the common properties of bright samples of gps sources are : small size ( @xmath1 1 kpc ) , powerful radio luminosity ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , and apparently low variability ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gps sources associated with quasars tend to show a complex morphology in vlbi images , while those associated with galaxies are likely to be double or triple radio sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral shape of gps sources is distinct from that of extended radio sources . generally , extended radio galaxies have steep spectral profiles , in contrast to the flat spectral profiles of quasars .",
    "gps sources have steep spectra at high frequencies , as do radio galaxies , which indicates optically thin synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , the low - frequency cutoff in the spectral profile is peculiar to gps sources .",
    "there has been a considerable debate regarding the interpretation of this low - frequency cutoff .",
    "the low - frequency cutoff is ascribed by some to synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "ssa is usually discussed in terms of the equipartition brightness temperature , @xmath4 ( assuming equipartition of energy between the radiating particles and the magnetic field ) , which is derived from the flux density and frequency of the spectral peak , and the optically thin spectral index .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed peak brightness temperature is consistent with the equipartition brightness temperature for the lobes of 2352 + 495 .",
    "@xcite suggested ssa based on correlations between the peak frequency and the angular size , and between the peak flux density and the angular size .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggested that the observed anticorrelation between @xmath5 and size can be explained by free  free absorption ( ffa ) .",
    "vsop and multi - frequency ground vlbi observations of oq 208 have been used to infer that ffa is the more likely mechanism , with the two radio lobes surrounded by a cold dense plasma which causes thermal ffa ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming intrinsically symmetric double lobes , the apparent asymmetry of opacities towards lobes was explained as being caused by the differences in path lengths through the plasma , which has an estimated electron density and electron temperature of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in addition , ffa is favored for other gps sources , such as 0108 + 388 @xcite and ngc 1052 @xcite .",
    "so far , the origin of the low - frequency cutoff has been discussed in terms of the spectral properties and brightness temperatures . however , since both ffa and ssa can produce similar spectral shapes , it is difficult to differentiate between the two mechanisms in this way . here , we examine the possibility of discriminating ffa from ssa by using the polarization properties of sources . in section  2",
    "we review the relevant polarization properties , and we describe the data analysis in section 3 , followed by section 4 where the results for the sources studied to date are given .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the polarization position angle ( pa ) is perpendicular to the magnetic field when synchrotron emission is optically thin in terms of ssa , while pa is parallel to the magnetic field in optically thick regimes .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "the ratio of the specific intensities , @xmath8 , determines the pa , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are specific intensities parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the specific intensity is approximately proportional to the emissivity , @xmath11 , when the emission is optically thin , and can be described as @xmath12 here , we assume that the number density of relativistic electrons follows a power law , @xmath13 , as a function of energy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant . when the emission is optically thick , the specific intensity is also inversely proportional to the absorption coefficient , @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 comparing equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can see that pa changes by 90@xmath18 between optically thick and optically thin regimes .",
    "the optical depth of synchrotron radiation decreases with increasing frequency , so that the radiation will be optically thick at low frequencies and optically thin at high frequencies .",
    "the spectral peak occurs at the frequency where the optical depth is approximately unity .",
    "therefore , the 90@xmath18 jump in pa appears across @xmath5 .",
    "such a @xmath0 jump of pa is found in some bl lac objects .",
    "absorption in bl  lac objects is thought to be due to ssa ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  1 shows ( a ) the total flux densities and ( b ) the pas of the bl  lac object 0212 + 735 over a period of 4 yr from observations at the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "the pa at 14.5 ghz jumped by @xmath0 after mjd 40100 , while at 4.8  ghz it remained almost constant .",
    "the total flux densities indicate that the emission was optically thick between 4.8 and 14.5  ghz before mjd 40100 , but became optically thin at 14.5 ghz .",
    "this variability is thought to be due to the expansion of a jet component .",
    "this synchronous change of the opacity and pa suggests a causal relationship between them , implying ssa rather than ffa in bl lac objects .",
    "another example of a @xmath0 jump is reported for the bl  lac object oj  287 @xcite .",
    "they detected a @xmath0 jump in pa for the core between 5  ghz and 22  ghz , and interpreted it as the transition from the optically thick to optically thin domain .",
    "the above properties of pa can be used as a test of the absorption mechanism in gps sources .",
    "if the low - frequency cutoff is caused by ssa , we expect to observe a @xmath0 jump in pas across the spectral peak frequency .",
    "otherwise , in the case of ffa , no such @xmath0 jump will be seen .",
    "( this , of course , assumes that the emission from optically thick regime dominates the polarized emission , an assumption which is easily tested by observations with sufficient angular resolution to resolve the contributions to the polarized flux from the various source components . ) based on polarization data just below @xmath5 , @xcite mentioned the possibility that the polarized emission may not come from the region responsible for the optically thick emission , or that the turnover is not due to ssa .",
    "because gps sources are generally not time variable , we combined multi - frequency observations around @xmath5 from various epochs to investigate the existence of the @xmath0 jump .",
    "we analyzed the pas of six gps sources observed with the vla ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our selection criteria were :    \\(1 ) to have more than 2 polarization observations in both optically thick and thin frequency regimes ,    \\(2 ) to have a percentage polarization higher than 0.1@xmath19 at 5 ghz .",
    "the sources 0248 + 430 , 0711 + 356 , 0738 + 313 , 0743@xmath20006 , 1143@xmath20245 and 2134 + 004 met these criteria .",
    "they have all been identified as quasars , and their properties are summarized in table  1 .",
    "these sources have between 4 and 6 polarization observations at different frequencies .",
    "the pas and percentage polarizations are given in table 2 , and the pas of the six sources as a function of squared wavelength ( @xmath21 ) are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the vertical lines in these plots indicate @xmath5 .",
    "we analyzed the distribution of the pas statistically . in the case of ffa ,",
    "pa follows the faraday rotation formula across the spectral peak , which can be fitted by @xmath22 at both optically thick and thin frequencies .",
    "here , @xmath23 is the pa observed at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is wavelength corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the free parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the faraday rotation measure and the intrinsic pa , respectively . in the case of ssa , pa is fitted as follows :    @xmath28    the sign `` @xmath29 '' indicates jump in pa between the optically thick and thin regimes .",
    "figure  3 shows an example of pas for 1143@xmath20245 , with and without @xmath30 offsets for the data points above the peak frequency .",
    "we fit both the ffa and ssa models to the data and evaluated the residuals for each source . here",
    ", we introduce `` @xmath31 '' as the distance of pa from the fit , @xmath32 this function has a @xmath33 period , and is thus free from the @xmath33 ambiguity in pa .",
    "when @xmath34 is sufficiently small , @xmath35 is approximately equal to @xmath36 . here , we define the residual , @xmath37 , as @xmath38 we use the ratio , @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 to determine which absorption mechanism is more likely .",
    "unless there is any significant difference of likelihood between the ffa and ssa models , as a first - order hypothesis , the ratio , @xmath39 , would follow the f - distribution , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the numbers of degrees of freedom corresponding to the @xmath44 values , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of variances , @xmath47 is also distributed as @xmath39 .",
    "evaluating @xmath39 , one can thus discriminate between two models .",
    "simply , if @xmath48 , then ffa is more likely .",
    "in table 3 and figure 4 , we show the results of statistical analysis . the value of @xmath39 is greater than 1 for all sources except 2134 + 004 .",
    "this implies that ffa is more likely than ssa . for 0711 + 356",
    ", @xmath49 indicates that the residual of the ffa model is significantly less than that of the ssa model .",
    "this means that a simple ssa model can not be accepted as the cause of the spectral cutoff below 1.6  ghz in this source . in the cases of 0738 + 313 and 0248 + 430 , @xmath39 = 2.431 and @xmath39 = 2.067 , respectively , again indicating that the ffa model is more likely . for 1143@xmath20245 , @xmath50 .",
    "this is because of the high @xmath26 in this source , which results in small values of @xmath51 for both models ( see figure  3 ) . for 0743@xmath20006 and 2134",
    "+ 004 , because we have only four data points , the degree of freedom is very small .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath51 for both ssa and ffa are small , and @xmath39 is close to 1 , as can be seen in figure  4b .",
    "although five of the six sources have @xmath52 , the case for ffa is not compelling , in part because of lack of observed frequencies , particularly around @xmath5 .",
    "the ssa model predicts not only the @xmath0 jump in pa , but also the change in the fractional polarization as a function of the wavelength . in the optically thin regime , the degree of polarization decreases with decreasing frequency , and becomes null at @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it increases again at the optically thick regime , but the polarization degree is @xmath53 1/10 of that at the optically thin regime . the percentage polarization is plotted as a function of @xmath21 for the six sources studied here in figure 5 . the variation in the degree of polarization expected from the ssa model can not be seen for any source except 0738 + 313 .",
    "this also implies that ssa is unlikely to be the cause of the low - frequency cutoff . for 2134 + 004 , @xmath541 results from the low spatial resolution against the complex structure of the source components .",
    "in fact , 2134 + 004 has two components , which have different @xmath26s @xcite .",
    "in such a case , our method should be applied to the individual components .",
    "the @xmath26 asymmetry of 2134 + 004 is easily explained by means of the ffa model .",
    "suppose that two intrinsically identical lobes are surrounded by dense plasma to produce ffa . because there is usually a difference in the path lengths to the lobes in the plasma , the @xmath26 differences reflect the differences in the path length .",
    "such a model allows us to estimate the electron density and the magnetic field @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "studies of the polarization properties of six published gps source have yielded no convincing evidence for the @xmath0 change in pa across the spectral peak expected from ssa models .",
    "this and the distribution of fractional polarization as a function of wavelength lead us to conclude that ffa may be the dominant cause for the low - frequency cutoffs in most of these sources .",
    "this research made use of data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory , which is supported by funds from the university of michigan .",
    "we thank philip g. edwards for much advice ."
