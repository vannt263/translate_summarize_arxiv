    "evolutionary games in complex networks have recently attracted attention in evolutionary biology , behavioral science and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "one of the most important questions in these fields is how network structure affects the evolution of cooperative behavior @xcite .",
    "nowak and may noted that the lattice structure enhances cooperative behavior in the prisoner s dilemma game @xcite .",
    "currently lattice structure is considered one of the mechanisms that support cooperation @xcite .",
    "however , hauert and doebeli found that lattice structure often inhibits cooperative behavior in the snowdrift game @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not clear how lattice structure affects the evolution of cooperation in general situation .",
    "lattice structure are characteristically predisposed to high clustering .",
    "the purpose of this study was to establish a theoretical formula that describes the influence of the clustering coefficient in evolutionary games .",
    "moreover , the effects of the lattice structure . have been clarified the pair approximation technique was applied to obtain an analytical solution @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient is used to measure the tendency of nodes in a network to cluster together @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a single node is defined as the probability that two randomly selected neighbors are connected to each other .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath0 of the entire network is determined by averaging the clustering coefficients of all nodes . for many social networks , such as file actor collaborations @xcite ,",
    "telephone calls @xcite , e - mails @xcite , sexual relationships @xcite , and citation networks @xcite , the clustering coefficients are greater than those of randomly established networks .",
    "although several studies have examined the effects of clustering on the organization of cooperation @xcite , there is little agreement as to whether clustering promotes or inhibits the evolution of cooperation .",
    "this study considers models with four different strategy - updating rules and presents analytical predictions .",
    "consider a static network with @xmath1 nodes .",
    "an individual occupies each node .",
    "individuals play games with all neighbors and their reproduction depends on the average payoff of a sequence of games .",
    "the snowdrift game is considered as an example .",
    "an individual chooses one of the two strategies : cooperation ( c ) or defection ( d ) .",
    "the payoff matrix is given by @xcite @xmath2 where the positive parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the benefit and cost of cooperation , respectively .",
    "the cost - to - benefit ratio of mutual cooperation is defined by @xmath5 . when @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , the snowdrift game has an inner nash equilibrium , where the cooperator frequency is @xmath8 . in this case , the two strategies coexist in a well - mixed population .",
    "this type of game is also known as the hawk - dove or chicken game .",
    "next , the networks on which this evolutionary game is performed are defined .",
    "all notes were assumed to have same degree @xmath9 ( the number of neighbors ) to focus on the network cluster coefficient effects .",
    "we used a random regular graph with a high clustering coefficient .",
    "the edge exchange method @xcite that selects two links randomly and repetitively was used to construct the graph .",
    "the links were rewired only when the new network configuration was connected and had a larger clustering coefficient .",
    "in addition , three types of regular lattices with periodic boundary conditions were used : square lattice with von neumann neighborhood ( @xmath10 ) , hexagonal lattice ( @xmath11 ) , and square lattice with moore neighborhood ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath0 is calculated as zero for the von neumann lattice , although it is highly clustered .",
    "the strategy was assumed to be updated stochastically and asynchronously .",
    "these are natural assumptions because strategy selection is not deterministic and occurs simultaneously in the population .",
    "four different strategy - updating rules were selected @xcite .    1 .",
    "birth - death ( bd ) .",
    "choose an individual @xmath13 with probability proportional to its fitness @xmath14 . then , choose another individual @xmath15 among the neighbors of individual @xmath13 .",

    "the fitness @xmath14 of individual @xmath13 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average payoff of all its neighbors .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the intensity of selection @xcite .",
    "we assumed a weak selection with small @xmath20 .",
    "this weak selection assumption allowed the pair approximation to be performed analytically within reason of what occurs in the biological world .",
    "a pair approximation was used to calculate the equilibrium state .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the densities of cooperators ( c ) and defectors ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the pair densities taken into consideration @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 represented the frequency that two neighboring pairs were cc , cd or dd .",
    "pairs cd and dc were not distinguished from each other .",
    "thus , @xmath26 .",

    "the simulations were performed for the von neumann square lattice ( @xmath10 ) , hexagonal lattice ( @xmath11 ) and moore lattice ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows numerical results for three types of two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the predictions ( [ sol_bd ] ) for bd and lc , ( [ sol_db ] ) for db , and ( [ sol_im ] ) for i m , were superimposed for reference where the parameters were set as @xmath10 and @xmath56 for the von neumann lattice , @xmath11 and @xmath57 for the hexagonal lattice , and @xmath12 and @xmath58 for the moore lattice in fig.[fig_3 ] .",
    "this result suggests that the ` effective ' cluster coefficients are approximately 0.5 , 0.65 , and 0.7 rather than the `` nominal '' values 0 , 0.4 , and 0.43 .",
    "the clustering coefficient measures the density of triangles in a network .",
    "this deviation is because of the effect of loops of length four and above .",
    "cooperator density increases when the degree @xmath9 decreases for db and i m updating rules .",
    "in conclusion , the frequency of the majority increases with the clustering coefficient . in situations where cooperators and defectors coexist and cooperators are the majority",
    ", clustering enhances cooperative behavior .",
    "when cooperators are the minority where cooperators and defectors coexist , clustering inhibits cooperative behavior .",
    "these results are independent of the strategy - updating rule .",
    "we can explain this tendency intuitively by using the heterophilicity @xcite as follows . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) , ( [ epa ] ) and ( [ ec2 ] ) , the heterophilicity @xcite is calculated as @xmath62 for all four updating rules .",
    "it is obvious @xmath63 , meaning that c have more connections to d than expected randomly .",
    "when the clustering coefficient @xmath0 increases , heterophilicity @xmath64 decreases . in this case , the population is more exclusive , and it is more difficult for strategies to coexist .",
    "consequently , the parameter region where two strategies can coexist becomes narrow .",
    "we performed numerical simulations for a small world network @xcite and a scale - free network on geographical space @xcite ( not shown ) to confirm the generality of this result , essentially the same results were obtained .",
    "unfortunately , a rigorous derivation of ( [ sol_db ] ) and ( [ sol_im ] ) is not provided and it remains an open problem .",
    "lastly , we considered the prisoner s dilemma game , where the payoff matrix is @xcite @xmath65 in this case , mutual defection is the only strong nash equilibrium , regardless of the values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , only defectors can survive in well - mixed population .",
    "in addition , cooperators can not survive for bd and lc updating rules . the standard pair approximation for the db updating rule shows",
    "if @xmath66 , only cooperators can survive ; conversely , if @xmath67 , only defectors can survive @xcite .",
    "the result is the same in the case of i m updating , except the threshold is @xmath68 . in any case",
    ", there is no parameter region where the two strategies can coexist .",
    "thus , the clustering coefficient has no influence on the density of cooperators in the prisoner s dilemma game . in conclusion ,",
