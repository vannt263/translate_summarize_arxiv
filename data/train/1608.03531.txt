    "blazars , a subclass of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are usually identified by their doppler - boosted non - thermal emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , originating from relativistic jets aligned near the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they exhibit significant , often dramatic variability at different wavelengths and on diverse timescales , ranging from minutes up to years and decades .",
    "in particular , flux fluctuations by a few percent observed on timescales of minutes and hours , are usually termed as an intraday / intranight variability ( idv / inv ) , or a microvariability @xcite",
    ". blazar microvariability at various frequencies has been studied by a number of authors since the late 70s , and was initially thought to result from the instrumental artifacts or external causes ( environmental scintillation , gravitational micro - lensing , etc . ;",
    "see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "later , however , with the improvement of sensitive instruments such as charged coupled device ( ccd ) cameras , and polarimetric measurements , those rapid and small - amplitude brightness fluctuations were fairly proved to be source - intrinsic , and in addition to originate in the innermost parts of relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the blazar optical emission zone is not spatially resolved on ( sub)-milliarc - second scales by any currently operating telescopes , the study of microvariabilty can be therefore used to understand the structure of agn outflows close to / at the jet base , and to constrain the main physical processes operating therein that shape the production of high - energy particles and non - thermal emission of blazar sources . yet , despite a substantial observational effort , as well as a comprehensive theoretical discussion on the topic , with various models and scenarios proposed , blazar variability ( and microvariability in particular ) is still relatively poorly understood .",
    "the polarimetric blazar variability in the optical band has been subjected to an extensive investigation in the past .",
    "the temporal polarization changes , observed on timescales from minutes to years , in most of the cases appear random , with no obvious or only a weak correlation between the polarization degree and the total flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . also ,",
    "more recently , several cases of prominent swings / rotations in the optical polarization angle accompanying high - energy @xmath6-ray outbursts of the brightest blazars have been reported @xcite .",
    "these results imply all together a complex magnetic field structure that determines the observed properties of the blazar synchrotron emission at optical wavelengths , including both the large - scale uniform component ( often modeled in terms of a ` grand - design ' helix ) , and also a smaller - scale turbulent component ( eventually only partly organized by the passage of shock waves and/or velocity shear within the outflow ) .    s5  0716 + 714 is one of the best known bl lac objects , at a redshift of approximately @xmath7 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . at radio frequencies ,",
    "s5  0716 + 714 appears on milliarc - second scales as a flat - spectrum , idv , and superluminal source , characterized by apparent velocities of various jet features reaching @xmath10 @xcite , and a very high brightness temperature of the compact core @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission continuum of the blazar is in general concave , marking the transition from the synchrotron to the inverse - compton emission components in the observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "s5  0716 + 714 has been also detected at @xmath6-ray photon energies by the egret , agile , and _",
    "fermi_-lat satellites ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at optical frequencies , s5  0716 + 714 appears as a bright , highly polarized , and highly variable source .",
    "long - term optical light curves of the blazar are presented in @xcite and @xcite , and its general optical polarization properties are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was shown repeatedly that optical flux changes of s5  0716 + 714 do not correlate with radio variability @xcite , but instead with @xmath6-ray flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , flares which in addition seem to be accompanied by large swings in the optical polarization angle @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodicity has been claimed in the optical light curves of the source for different epochs and at various timescales of hours , days , and years @xcite .",
    "the optical microvariability of s5  0716 + 714 has been widely investigated by a number of authors , who found high or very high inv duty cycle , often ( though not always ) bluer - when - brighter spectral behavior , red noise - type power spectra , and in some cases clear polarization degree",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      as shown in figures[rawlightcurve ] and [ bvri ] , in addition to a day - long modulation of the s5  0716 + 714 light curve , we have detected also a number of rapid `` microflares '' during the 2014 webt campaign . here",
    "we attempt to model some of them , assuming that they represent separate and distinct flaring events  `` pulse emission '' components  superimposed upon a relatively slowly - varying background component . in particular , making use of the simultaneous flux , pd , and pa measurements , for our analysis we have selected microflares detected during the time intervals 2534 , 3446 , 7985 , and 8590h from the start of the campaign ( marked in figure [ rawlightcurve ] by dashed vertical lines ) , which are shown in detail in the first columns of figures[microflare1 ] , [ microflare2 ] , [ microflare3 ] , and [ microflare4 ] ( hereafter `` microflare1 '' , `` microflare2 '' , `` microflare3 '' , and `` microflare4 '' , respectively ) . an in - depth discussion on microflare3 is presented in @xcite    due to the linearly additive properties of total flux @xmath11 and the stokes @xmath12 and @xmath13 intensities , our base assumption regarding the distinctive nature of microflares implies @xmath14 where the `` microflare '' and the `` background '' emission components are denoted by indices `` 1 '' and `` 0 '' , respectively .",
    "for each analyzed event , background intensities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are estimated from fitting the data collected just before and just after a given microflare , and next microflaring intensities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are found , giving us the microflare polarization degree @xmath21 and polarization angle @xmath22 @xmath23 ( for further discussion see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting evolutions in intensity and polarization of the selected events are presented in the second and third columns of figures[microflare1][microflare4 ] . as shown ,",
    "all the analyzed microflares are highly polarized , @xmath24 , but only microflare3 displays a clear looping behavior in @xmath25 ( or equivalently @xmath26 ) plain , with higher pd during the decaying phase of the pulse emission .",
    "microflare1 exhibits a similar evolutionary pattern , with the overall anti - correlation between the flux and pd , but due to the large observational errors , any clear looping in the @xmath25 plane can not be identified for this event with high confidence .",
    "hints for the pd / flux anti - correlation can also be seen for microflares3 and 4 .",
    "an interesting difference between epochi and epochii can be noted here .",
    "namely , while for the first two analyzed microflares1 & 2 the pa of the pulse emission , @xmath27deg , is larger than that of the background components , @xmath28deg , being in addition relatively close to the jet position angle ( @xmath29deg for the innermost parts of the outflow , i.e. within 0.12mas from the core , and @xmath30deg farther down the jet , according to the high - resolution radio image obtained on 2014 february 24 within the vlba - bu - blazar project ; figure[radio ] ) , for the latter two microflares3 & 4 we derive @xmath31 with @xmath32deg closely aligned with the jet axis .",
    "the 2014 webt campaign targeting s5  0716 + 714 was organized to monitor the source simultaneously in a number of the optical photo - polarimetric filters , for a longer period of time , in order to investigate in detail the evolution of flux , polarization degree , and polarization angle on timescales ranging from tens of minutes up to several days .",
    "the successfully conducted campaign , participated by many observatories all around the world , resulted in unprecedented dataset spanning @xmath0h of nearly continuous , multi - band observations ( five consecutive days of flux measurements , including two sets of polarimetric data mainly in r filter , lasting each for about 25h with no major interruptions ) .",
    "the data were analyzed extensively using different statistical methods and approaches .",
    "the main observational findings can be summarized as follows :    * during the campaign , the source displayed a pronounced variability with peak - to - peak variations of @xmath33 , consisting of a day - timescale modulation with superimposed rapid ( hourly - timescale ) microflares characterized by flux changes by @xmath2mag ; in general , variability amplitudes increase with the observing frequency . *",
    "the overall variability of the source is of the red noise type ( consistent with a random - walk process ) ; _ some _ hints for the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations with the characteristic timescales of @xmath34h and @xmath35h have been found , but the in - depth analysis we have performed regarding these features , including an estimate of a `` global '' confidence bound in the source periodogram , as well as data folding , reveals that they do not represent highly significant departures from a pure red - noise power spectrum .",
    "* flux changes in different bands track each other well , with no significant evidence for any time lags .",
    "* `` bluer - when - brighter '' trend has been found in the source light curve , in a sense that flux maxima appear in general bluer than flux minima , but no tight correlation between the source flux and color could be established .",
    "these results are broadly consistent to what was found before for s5  0716 + 714 , in particular regarding the bluer - when - brighter trend @xcite , although we note at the same time that the previous claims regarding the inter - band variability time lags in the source have been often contradictory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also that the previous searches for the source quasi - periodicity were rather inconclusive @xcite .",
    "we argue that the bluer - when - brighter behavior implies that the observed flux enhancements are produced either during the episodes of an intensified particle acceleration , or alternatively by the fluctuating magnetic field superimposed on the underlying steady electron energy distribution with a concave shape . with respect to the source periodocity",
    ", we emphasize that the quality of the light curve analyzed here  in particular its duration and uniquely dense sampling  is basically unprecedented and as such perfectly suited for a search of hourlong quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "the fact that we did not find such at the significance level high enough to claim the detection , is therefore very meaningful , implying no persistent periodic signal in the source within the analyzed variability timescale domain .      *",
    "the @xmath36h - long period of the source inactivity has been observed ; interestingly , in 2003 the blazar went through a very similar phase , at almost same `` quiescence / plateau '' flux level .",
    "* at a certain configuration of the optical polarization angle relative to the positional angle of the innermost radio jet in the source ( epochi in ",
    "[ sec : pol ] ) , changes in the optical polarization degree led the total flux variability by about @xmath37h ; meanwhile , at the time when the relative configuration of the polarization and jet angles altered ( epochii ) , no time lag between polarization degree and flux changes could be noted . * the microflaring events , when analyzed as separate pulse emission components superimposed over a slowly - variable background ,",
    "are characterized by a very high polarization degree ( @xmath38 ) , and polarization angles which may differ substantially from the polarization angle of the underlying background component , or from the radio jet positional angle .",
    "the peculiar plateau phase in the source light curve could be explained as resulting from a sudden but only temporary decrease in the jet production efficiency by the central accretion disk / supermassive black hole ( smbh ) system .",
    "in this scenario , the observed optical emission of the blazar results from a superposition of fluxes produced within some larger portion of the outflow , from sub - parsec up to parsec scales , such that the emerging flux decreases with the distance , and the characteristic variability timescale increases ( as a result of the jet radial expansion ) . a sudden disruption of the outflow at the jet base , resulting from some accretion disk instability around the jet launching region , would then result in a short - term `` disappearance '' of the highly variable innermost emission component , leaving only a slowly variable emission of the outer portions of the jet , and hence manifesting in the source light curve as a distinct plateau .",
    "note that the optical spectrum during the plateau phase is not much different from that observed during the rest of the 2014 webt campaign , indicating that the `` plateau flux '' is still due to the jet and not the accretion disk emission .",
    "also , the fact that in 2003 a similar plateau has been observed at a similar flux level , which is however _ not _ a historical flux minimum of the source , indicates that this outer emission component is not completely steady , but instead variable on very long timescales of years and decades .",
    "the 6h duration of the observed plateau could be linked to the characteristic timescale for re - building the outflow within the jet launching region , for which the _ shortest _ one would be the keplerian period around the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the accretion disk , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the black hole mass and @xmath41 is the gravitational radius light - crossing timescale ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the 6h interval ( seen both in 2014 and also in 2003 ) , would imply @xmath42 for the maximally spinning smbh ( @xmath43 ) , the value which should be considered as a safe upper limit for the s5  0716 + 714 black hole mass , or @xmath44 assuming very low spin values ( @xmath45 ) .    during the 2014 webt campaign",
    ", we have also witnessed a very complex relation between the total intensity and the polarization properties of s5  0716 + 714 . in particular , during one brief incidence lasting @xmath46 h , the observed flux was found to be in clear anti - correlation with the polarization degree as marked in the left column figure of figure [ microflare1 ] ( see also * ? ? ? * for the similar case in the blazar bl lac in longer timescales ) ; whereas considering the whole epoch the changes in the polarization degree were found to be leading the flux changes by about 2h .",
    "this suggests a delay between a build - up of the magnetic flux within the dominant emission region , and the onset of an efficient particle acceleration that follows , a behavior which could be reconciled with the scenario in which magnetic reconnection processes play a major role in the jet energy dissipation ( see in this context the most recent discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "yet during the subsequent epoch the optical polarization degree was well correlated with the optical flux , in agreement to what could be expected from the simplest model of a shock propagating along the jet ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) , so the overall picture may not be unique . still , the difference between the two epochs involved also a difference in the optical polarization angle , and in particular in an alignment of the polarization angle relative to the jet axis . hence , it is possible that delays between the magnetic field build - up and the onset of particle acceleration are universal , but can be spotted only in the cases of a particular magnetic field orientation with respect to the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "a further insight into the energy dissipation processes in s5  0716 + 714 , and other similar blazars , is provided by polarization properties of the shortest time - scale and smaller - amplitude fluctuations of the source .",
    "such fluctuations are , in general , believed to be produced within small , possibly independent sub - volumes of blazar jets , that could be identified with isolated turbulent cells , magnetic reconnection sites , their mini - outflows , or small - scale shocks induced by such within the main jet body ( see in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we have shown that , when modeled as distinct pulses superimposed on a slowly varying background component ( see in this context also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such microflares are always highly polarized , but at the same time are characterized by very different polarization angles which may deviate substantially from the polarization angles of the underlying background emission .    in @xcite",
    "we noted that , if blazar microflares are due to small - scale but strong shock waves propagating within the outflow , and compressing efficiently a disordered small - scale jet magnetic field component , one may expect various microflares to be characterized by very different polarization degrees , due to the fact that the expected value of the polarization degree depends strongly on the combination of the shock bulk lorentz factor and the angle between the shock normal and the line of sight : even small changes in both parameters may result in significant changes in polarization degree !",
    "yet what we observe during the entire 2014 webt campaign is that despite vastly different polarization angles of the microflaring events , the degree of the polarization is always very high .",
    "this finding calls for an alternative interpretation of blazar microflares .",
