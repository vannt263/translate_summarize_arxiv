    "the recent h1 data are presented in terms of a reduced cross section @xmath5 , integrated over @xmath6 , the 4-momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the inelasticity ) which is expressed in terms of the diffractive structure functions @xmath9 and the longitudinal @xmath10 as @xmath11 the proof @xcite of qcd hard scattering factorization in diffractive dis justifies to express @xmath12 , at fixed @xmath3 , as a convolution of diffractive parton distributions ( dpdf s ) @xmath13 and partonic cross sections @xmath14 : @xmath15 the @xmath13 should obey the dglap evolution equations and the @xmath14 are the same as for standard dis . in a next - to - leading order ( nlo )",

    "the qcd fit program is the one used in @xcite , extended for diffraction . in the fit , the experimental systematic errors of the data points and their correlations are propagated to obtain error bands for the resulting dpdf s .",
