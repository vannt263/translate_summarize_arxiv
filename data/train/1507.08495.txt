    "the algorithmic translation of theorem  [ to_end ] translates the sentence _ to each sequence of embedded quarters , we can define an end to which the sequence of their vertices converge_. this notion of convergence means that it is possible to assign to each line  @xmath138 of the pentagrid a rank  @xmath168 which ensures that the quarters with a higher rank are beyond  @xmath138 and that the sequence of the  @xmath138 s define an end .",
    "we may assume that the lines of the pentagrid can also be encoded , for example , by a pair of vertices of the pentagrid .",
    "the convergence of this sequence of lines to an end can not be checked but it nonetheless can be defined . indeed , from lemma  [ linepenta ] , if a line  @xmath88 defines a half - plane containing an end  @xmath125 , there is a line of the pentagrid  @xmath138 which defines a half - plane also containing  @xmath125 .",

    "the proof consists in constructing a sequence of sequences of quarters for which there is no algorithm defining an end .",
    "we define the sequence of sequences as follows .",
    "first , we need an algorithmic ingredient : it is the kleene function , which takes value  1 if the @xmath205 step of computation of the @xmath206 turing machine halted on the data encoded by  @xmath21 and it takes value  0 if this is not the case .",

    "we define a flag by  .",
    "it is clear that for each  @xmath21 , the sequence is a sequence of embedded quarters .",
    "the sequence is stepwise and it has no alternation by construction . if the turing machine numbered by  @xmath21 does not halt on the data  @xmath21 , then for all  @xmath121 and so , the sequence is ultimately direct , it is even direct , so that , by lemma  [ non_alternate ] , the sequence @xmath217 converges to  @xmath209 .",
    "if the turing machine numbered by  @xmath21 halts on the data  @xmath21 , there is an integer  @xmath118 such that and . accordingly , but , afterwards , the sequence satisfies and .",
    "the sequence is again ultimately alternate but , this time , it converges to the end @xmath174 of  @xmath127 which is contained in the other side of  @xmath208 with respect to  @xmath20 .",
