    "comets , which consist of volatiles and dark ( of typical geometric albedo @xmath8= 0.020.06 ; @xcite ) , reddish refractory , lose their volatiles near their surfaces after many returning orbits .",
    "simultaneously , their surfaces are covered with an inert dust mantle that prevents sublimation of subsurface ice @xcite . eventually , their appearances would be indistinguishable from asteroids through astronomical observations .",
    "it has been speculated that there could be dormant or extinct comets in the list of known asteroids . because the physical lifetime of short - period comets in the inner solar system ( @xmath91@xmath1010@xmath11 years ) is 101000 times longer than that of the devolatilization timescale of ices @xcite",

    ". they conducted optical and infrared observations from ground to derive the albedo of asteroids in cometary orbits and found a clear correlation between the tisserand parameter and albedo , suggesting that @xmath0 is a good indicator to discriminate between asteroids and comets .",
    "a follow - up survey was performed by @xcite , using visible ( 0.550.90  ) and near - infrared ( 0.82.3  ) spectrographs .",

    "@xcite compared these three infrared asteroidal catalogs with valid sizes and albedos and merged them into single catalog ( i  a ",

    "a number of asteroids were detected by two or three satellites : 1993 asteroids by three satellites , 2812 asteroids by _ akari _ and _ wise _ , and 312 asteroids by _ iras _ and _ wise_. in such cases , @xcite selected data from _ akari _ as the highest priority , _ wise _ as the second , and _ iras _ as the third priority , although there are no remarkable differences in sizes and albedos among these catalogs .",

    "2 .   second , we examined dynamical groups of asteroids according to their orbital elements .",
    "we followed the definition used in @xcite , where they defined dynamical groups of asteroids based on their osculating orbital elements .",
    "after classification of dynamical groups , we excluded asteroids in three dynamical groups ",
    "jupiter trojans ( @xmath24  au ) , hildas ( @xmath25  au , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and cybeles ( @xmath28  au , @xmath26 and @xmath29 )  for extracting acos and pdcs , since these asteroids could be native objects trapped in these regions soon after the formation of the solar system and are unlikely to be dormant comets recently captured in the current solar system @xcite .",
    "we calculated the tisserand parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "in general , a criterion of @xmath3 has been applied for objects in comet - like orbits whereas @xmath18 has been applied for objects in asteroidal orbits , although there are some exceptions for comets .",

    "main - belt comets have orbits indistinguishable from main - belt asteroids ( @xmath18 ) but show comet - like activities owing to sublimation of ice , impacts , and so on @xcite .",
    "we excluded objects having @xmath31 , and we do not consider objects classified as encke - type comets and main - belt comets because of the difficulty in discriminating them from the majority of asteroids .",
    "4 .   orbital uncertainty should be considered to extract acos from the catalog .",
    "we noticed that there is a large discrepancy in the orbital elements of some asteroids between lowell observatory and the jpl small - body database browser .",
    "in particular , the _ wise _ mission discovered a number of new asteroids .",
    "some of them are newly discovered asteroids whose orbital elements are not determined well because of inadequate orbital arcs and/or number of observations . since the tisserand parameters calculated with poorly determined orbital elements could lead to erroneous results , we computed the error of the tisserand parameter , @xmath32 , and eliminated them from the list of acos unless the error was enough to distinguish acos from the majority of asteroids .",
    "we thus calculated @xmath32 with the following equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are uncertainties of semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination , respectively , given by the jpl small - body database browser .",
    "we set the threshold for the elimination of @xmath32 to be > 0.1 .",
    "we excluded 349 aco candidates with @xmath37 because of the large uncertainty in @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , we adopted a criterion for the aphelion of @xmath22  au following @xcite .",
    "this is an effective condition to exclude some main - belt asteroids ( e.g. , asteroids with high - inclined orbits ) .",
    "for comparison , we examined the orbital elements of active comets in the jpl small - body database search engine and found that all except 12 encke - type comets and 10 main - belt comets have @xmath38  au ( as of march 2014 ) . because we do not consider encke - type comets and main - belt comets , we set the criterion @xmath38  au .",
    "although we excluded the hilda group above , 41 objects that marginally do not fall into the category of the hilda group still remained .",
    "their osculating semimajor axes fall into the hilda group ( i.e. , @xmath39  au ) but they have eccentricity and/or inclination slightly larger than the hilda asteroids . as we discuss later , we excluded 38 objects among them and regarded only 3 objects as acos .",
    "in this section , we examine the albedos of acos extracted based on the criteria in section 2.2 and define the pdcs that have comets - like orbits ( i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22  au ) and comet - like albedos ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "then , we study the physical characteristics of pdcs and the other acos .",
    "figure [ fig : albedo](a ) shows the histogram of geometric albedos of acos . for comparison",
    ", we provide the albedo histogram of acos with a criterion for the tisserand parameter , i.e. , @xmath41 , suggested by @xcite because it provides a more assured condition for extracting comet - like objects",
    ". there is , however , no big differences between the two criterion of @xmath0 in our sample of acos . since the appearance of histogram may depend on the choice of the bin width ( @xmath42 ) , we changed it from @xmath42=0.005 to 0.015 but could not find any significant differences in the appearances .",
    "the histogram shows a prominent peak with a mode around 0.040.05 .",
    "our sample of acos includes some objects with high albedos regardless of the severe @xmath0 criterion .",
    "figure [ fig : albedo](b ) compares our sample of acos with that of active comets based on the data in @xcite , together with a few samples from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "comets have a mean albedo of 0.046 with a standard deviation of 0.020 if we fit a gaussian function .",
    "because no comets have albedo >  0.1 , we placed the upper limit of comet - like albedo at 0.1 .",
    "our upper bound of comet - like albedo ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) is slightly higher than that in @xcite , where they adopted the comet - like albedo of @xmath44 .",
    "the difference seems to be trivial , but we used the criterion of @xmath45 because a few comet nuclei with higher albedo ( @xmath46 ) were recognized ( @xmath47 for 212p and @xmath48 for c/2011 kp36 ) by @xcite and @xcite .    the average albedo of pdcs is @xmath49 , which is similar to those of the active comet nuclei mentioned above ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a peak in the pdc distribution appears near 0.040.05 , which is consistent with the peak in the comet albedo distribution .",
    "these similarities suggest that we have extracted dormant comets from the asteroid catalogs in an appropriate manner .",
    "the size distribution of an ensemble of minor bodies gives us information helpful for explaining their source region and evolutionary history .",
    "the cumulative size distribution has been applied in previous research .",
    "it is approximated by the mathematical form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cumulative number of bodies larger than diameter @xmath53 , and @xmath54 denotes the power index of the cumulative size distribution .",
    "we examined the cumulative size distribution of pdcs in terms of two different origins : jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) , considered to originate from the scattered disk of the solar system @xcite , and nearly - isotropic comets ( nics ) , originating from the oort cloud @xcite . in some of the literature , nics are further subdivided into long - period comets with orbital period @xmath55  years and halley - type comets with @xmath56  years .",
    "we separated our samples into two groups , one having @xmath57 ( pdcs in jfc - like orbits ) and another having @xmath58 ( pdcs in nic - like orbits ) .",
    "figure [ fig : csd ] shows the cumulative size distributions of pdcs in jfc - like orbits ( a ) and pdcs in nic - like orbits ( b ) .",
    "we incorporate 11 pdcs from @xcite in our list , so that the total number of pdcs increased from 83 to 94 .",
    "these size distributions are compared with those of active comets . in figure",
    "[ fig : csd ] , we applied the sizes of active jfcs in @xcite and active nics in @xcite .",
    "we found that pdcs have a shallower size distribution than active comets , although the number of samples for nics ( only 17 pdcs in the nic class ) may not be significant for a statistical discussion .",
    "careful comparison between pdcs in jfc - like orbits and active comets makes us aware that the the size distributions show good agreement in the small - size range @xmath59  km , that is , @xmath54 = 1.0 for pdcs and @xmath54 = 1.1 for jfc nucleus ; however , they show a significant discrepancy in slope in the big - size range ( 410  km in diameter ) , that is , @xmath54 = 1.11 @xmath60 0.04 for pdcs and @xmath54 = 1.9 for active jfcs @xcite .",
    "we have eight acos whose spectral taxonomic types are known .",
    "there are one c - type object ( 7604 kridsadaporn ) , four d - type objects ( 944 hidalgo , 3552 don quixote , 6144 kondojiro , and 20898 fountainhills ) , and three x- or p - type objects ( 3688 navajo , p/2006 hr30 , and 2001 xp1 ) .",
    "the x - type @xcite has subcategories depending on the albedo measurements : e- and m - types for high albedos and medium albedos and p - type for the low albedos equivalent to comets ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) .",
    "we classify two x - type acos as of p - type , according to their low albedos .",
    "all eight objects have significantly low albedo @xmath61 ) .",
    "we examined the spectral slopes @xmath62 of these eight objects , which express the percentage change in the reflectance per 1000    of wavelength difference @xcite .",
    "we computed the slope of four objects ( 7604 kridsadaporn , 944 hidalgo , 3552 don quixote and 2001 xp1 ) .",
    "together with the @xmath62 values in @xcite and @xcite , we obtained @xmath63 , which is consistent with the slopes of dormant comet candidates ( @xmath64% ) and comet nuclei ( @xmath65% ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these eight objects are most likely pdcs .",
    "in fact , p/2006 hr30 and 3552 don quixote showed comet - like activities after their discovery as asteroids @xcite .",
    "we identified a peculiar population of acos that have high albedos unlike comet nuclei ; this is an unexpected population .",
    "because we excluded objects with @xmath66 , they are not caused by inaccuracy in their orbital elements .",
    "the total divergence among i  a  w is 10% in diameter and 22% in albedo at the @xmath67 level @xcite , which is small enough to justify the existence of acos with high albedo .",
    "therefore , it is likely that there are high - albedo asteroids in comet - like orbits .",
    "to understand the unexpected population , we studied the physical characteristics of these high - albedo acos .",
    "figure 4 shows a plot of diameter against perihelion distance for all acos ( a ) and acos with @xmath68 ( b ) .",
    "note that the paucity of small acos beyond @xmath69  au is an observational bias .",
    "we found a pronounced tendency for high - albedo acos to concentrate in near - earth space ( i.e. , @xmath7  au ) .",
    "in addition , they consist of small asteroids ( @xmath703 km ) . in figure 4 , there are four high - albedo acos at @xmath71  au . among them ,",
    "three objects have albedo of @xmath72 , that is , 2009 qk35 ( @xmath73 ) , 2010 mb86 ( @xmath74 ) , and 2010 mk43 ( @xmath75 ) , and one object , 2010 rm64 ( @xmath76 ) , marginally has high albedo .",
    "thus , nearly all high - albedo acos consist of small asteroids at @xmath7  au . this trend can not be explained by the observational bias . because the result is obtained based on the mid - infrared data , which , unlike optical observations , are less sensitive to albedo values , it provides reliable sets of asteroid albedo information .",
    "if there are big acos with high albedo beyond @xmath77  au , they would be detected easily .",
    "although further dynamical study is essential to evaluate the population quantitatively , we propose that such acos with high albedos were injected from the domain of @xmath18 via the yarkovsky effect , because small objects with higher surface temperature are susceptible to the thermal drag force and gradually change their orbital elements to be observed as acos in our list .",
    "in this subsection , we compare our results with those from previous research on acos .",
    "@xcite found that nearly all objects in their sample with @xmath68 have comet - like albedos ( @xmath78 ) , implying that objects with @xmath68 are most likely dormant comets .",
    "they also found that the transition region @xmath79 comprises a mixture of high - albedo and low - albedo objects , suggesting that the region is populated by a variety of sources .",
    "a similar argument was made by @xcite , who insisted that a criterion of @xmath80 provides the most reliable sets of pdcs based on their spectral survey of acos . following the work by @xcite",
    ", we made a plot of geometric albedo with respect to @xmath0 ( figure [ fig : tj ] ) .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , we confirm the similar trend that most objects with small @xmath0 have low albedo",
    ". however , our results differ from those of @xcite and @xcite in that we find high - albedo objects in the region @xmath41 . because @xcite detected small objects ( @xmath703 km ) , it is not surprising that they potentially detected acos with high albedo in the region of @xmath68 .",
    "it is not clear why they did not detect such acos with high albedo .",
    "a possible explanation of such high - albedo objects is the inadequate measurements of optical magnitudes in our samples .",
    "in fact , @xcite measured both optical and infrared magnitudes simultaneously by themselves with ground - based telescopes , providing reliable albedo data , whereas our infrared survey data relied on absolute magnitudes in which there is an intrinsic difficulty in determining the absolute magnitudes and eventually the albedos @xcite .    to refute the uncertain factor related to optical magnitudes",
    ", we observed three objects : 2006 hy51 ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) , 2006 cs ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , and 2010 ny1 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) .",
    "we made optical observation of these acos with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) attached to the 8.2-m subaru telescope atop mauna kea ( hawaii , usa ) on june 5 , 2013 ( ut ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed using sa 104 - 430 , sa 110 - 361 , and mark a2 listed in @xcite .",
    "the observed magnitudes were converted into absolute magnitudes by assuming a phase slope of 0.035  mag  deg@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "we obtained absolute v magnitudes of 17.18 @xmath60 0.30 ( 2006 hy51 ) , 16.76 @xmath60 0.09 ( 2006 cs ) , and 17.07 @xmath60 0.21 ( 2010 ny1 ) , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the magnitude used by @xcite , who employed 17.20 , 16.60 , and 16.70 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that optical magnitudes led to poor albedo values , at least for these three acos .    with subaru , we derived the color of one object , 2006 cs ( @xmath83 ) , as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "these indices are less red than the average comet nucleus but in the possible range of pdcs .",
    "we could not derive the color of the other two objects because of the faintness at the time of our observation .",
    "instead , we found the spectrum of 2006 hy51 archived in smass .",
    "although 2006 hy51 s taxonomic type is not identified , it exhibits several key features typical of silicaceous ( e.g. , s - type ) asteroids having a red continuum at 11.5  and shallow absorption around 2  , probably associated with the presence of pyroxene @xcite . together with the moderately high albedo ( @xmath81",
    "as determined from _ wise _ ) and the spectrum , we may conclude that 2006 hy51 is not a dormant comet nucleus but is a high - albedo aco .      in the i  a  w catalog",
    ", we found that there are a considerable number of objects having @xmath90 but not categorized as acos by our criteria ( see section 2.2 ) , that is , 1764 in jupiter trojans , 432 in the hilda region , and 104 in the cybele region .",
    "theoretical studies suggested that the trojans were captured during the early stages of jupiter s growth @xcite or via the effects of nebular gas @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that they were captured during planetary migration , which occurred about 500600 million years after the solar system s formation @xcite . in either case , it may be true that jupiter trojans were objects trapped in the early stage of the solar system s formation and not dormant comets captured recently .",
    "the hilda asteroids are in another region populated by interplanetary bodies in the 3:2 inner mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "because of their stable orbits , the hilda asteroids are also considered to be objects formed in the early stage of the solar system , although there are about 1020 comets that have been captured temporarily in the hilda region @xcite .",
    "the hilda asteroids are defined as objects that have osculating orbital elements @xmath25  au , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . as we described in section 2.2",
    ", there are a considerable number of objects ( 42 ) with @xmath91 that marginally fall off the conditions of the hilda group .",
    "figure [ fig : hilda ] shows the histograms of semimajor axis and eccentricity of acos , including objects close to the hilda asteroids .",
    "there is an unnatural prominent peak near the edge of the hilda region ( @xmath92  au , @xmath93 ) .",
    "we investigated the dynamical stability of 42 acos using the dynamical integration code mercury 6 @xcite .",
    "we thus integrated their orbits forward for 100,000 years ( longer than the physical time scale of short - period comets ) .",
    "we found that all but three objects have stable orbits over the timescale of 100,000 years .",
    "although there are uncertainties in the dynamical simulation such as the value of the yarkovsky force and the rocket force ( for active comets ) , we conservatively consider that these three objects ( 2000 su236 , 2008 um7 , and 2009 sc298 ) are acos and pdcs .",
    "let us consider how the yarkovsky effect moves an asteroid into a comet - like orbit . as shown in figure 7(a ) , high - albedo acos concentrate in a range of 2@xmath70a@xmath703.5 au , similar to main - belt asteroids and jfcs .",
    "the tisserand parameter is a function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , while the yarkovsky effect changes @xmath15 . due to the similarity in @xmath15 between high - albedo acos and main - belt asteroids",
    ", we would conjecture that subsequent dynamical effects may change @xmath16 and @xmath17 . as widely known as a standard model for orbital evolution of near - earth asteroids , the yarkovsky effect could move small main - belt asteroids orbits until they are close to resonances with planets , and subsequently",
    ", these resonances can push them in terrestrial planet crossing orbits ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations demonstrated that chaotic resonances cause a significant increase in their @xmath16 and @xmath17 of test particles in the resonance regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that some objects on @xmath943 ( or even @xmath942 ) can result from chaotic resonances .",
    "we reviewed the semimajor axes of acos in our list .",
    "figure 8 shows @xmath15-@xmath16 plot of acos together with major resonances .",
    "although there are a couple of acos close to resonances , their semimajor axes are not related to these major resonances .",
    "therefore , it may be reasonable to think that encounters with terrestrial planets as well as chaotic resonances with massive planets can drift main - belt asteroids into comet - like orbits .      over the past decade",
    ", a number of attempts have been made to derive the size distributions of active comets @xcite and dormant comets @xcite .",
    "these research results exhibit a wide range of the power index of the cumulative size distribution , that is , @xmath952.7 for active comets and @xmath952.6 for dormant comets .",
    "most of this research ( except that of @xcite ) was conducted by using optical magnitudes of these objects .",
    "note that the observed quantity ( i.e. , magnitude ) is proportional to the product of the albedo and the square of the size , and in these research studies albedo values were assumed .",
    "in addition , the phase - angle dependence of magnitudes is also presumed in these studies .",
    "since the data taken in the mid - infrared wavelength provide the size of the objects without any albedo assumption , they yield a reliable data set of the size distribution of active comets and dormant comets .    we therefore compare the power exponents of active jfcs , @xmath96 @xcite , with that of pdcs , @xmath97 ( this work ) .",
    "because the difference is significantly larger than those of the errors of measurements , this indicates that a physical mechanism is responsible for creating the difference in the course of cometary evolution .",
    "the moderate slope of the size distribution for pdcs ( @xmath98 ) implies that big objects are more abundant in the list of dormant objects .",
    "the splitting of comets , a phenomena that has been occasionally observed , can be a possible mechanism leading to the change in the power exponents . a good example event was observed at 73p / schwassmann - wachamann 3 , in which the comet nucleus was ground into 10100  m bodies .",
    "the power exponents of the cumulative size distribution of the fragments was @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "if the splitting is a principal mechanism in determining the size distribution of comet nuclei , the size distribution of pdcs might be steeper than the value we derived for pdcs .",
    "another explanation is that big comet nuclei may develop inert surface dust layers more effectively than small ones because dust particles with small ejection velocity can not escape from the big nuclei against the gravitational force and eventually form surface dust layers that insulates subsurface ice against solar heating and/or choke off ice sublimation .",
    "a similar argument was made by @xcite , who mentioned the possible choking mechanism on the large comet nuclei of 49p / arend  regaux and 28p / neujmin 1 .",
    "we also should consider the observational bias .",
    "big objects are favorably detected at distant locations .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows the diameter of acos as a function of the semimajor axis @xmath15 . in the figure ,",
    "it is clear that only big acos were detected beyond @xmath100  au , most likely because of the observation selection bias .",
    "we plotted the size distribution of pdcs within @xmath101  au to evaluate the effect .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows a comparison of the size distribution between all pdcs and pdcs within @xmath101  au . although there is a large discrepancy in the largest size probably because of the insignificant number of samples , the slopes are consistent with one another in the size range of 24  km .",
    "in addition , we adopted a criterion to eliminate the observational bias in @xcite , and obtained @xmath54=1.27 .",
    "although the power exponent is sensitive to the criteria we selected , we can safely say @xmath54 is around 1.1 ( neither @xmath700.8 nor @xmath1021.3 ) .",
    "therefore , we may rule out the possibility of observational selection bias . in summary , rapid growth of a dust mantle on the big comet nuclei",
    "favors the obtained size exponent of pdcs .",
    "in this paper , we address the question of the existence of dormant comets in the list of asteroids . motivated by the recent developments of infrared asteroid catalogs ( i  a ",

    "<S> we investigated the population of asteroids in comet - like orbits using available asteroid size and albedo catalogs of data taken with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ , _ akari _ , and the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ on the basis of their orbital properties ( i.e. , the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath0 , and the aphelion distance , @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that ( i ) there are 123 asteroids in comet - like orbits by our criteria ( i.e. , @xmath2  au and @xmath3 ) , ( ii ) 80%  of them have low albedo , @xmath4 , consistent with comet nuclei , ( iii ) low - albedo objects among them have a size distribution shallower than that of active comet nuclei , that is , the power index of the cumulative size distribution of around 1.1 , ( iv ) unexpectedly , a considerable number ( i.e. , 25 by our criteria ) of asteroids in comet - like orbits have high albedo , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we noticed that such high - albedo objects mostly consist of small ( @xmath6  km ) bodies distributed in near - earth space ( with perihelion distance of @xmath7  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such high - albedo , small objects were susceptible to the yarkovsky effect and drifted into comet - like orbits via chaotic resonances with planets . </S>"
