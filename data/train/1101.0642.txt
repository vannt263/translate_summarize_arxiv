    "in @xcite we have proposed stripper ( sector improved phase space for real radiation ) , a novel subtraction scheme for the evaluation of double - real radiation contributions in next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) qcd calculations . as suggested by the name , it is the phase space that acquires a special rle in our approach .",
    "once it is suitably parameterized and decomposed , laurent expansions of arbitrary infrared safe observables can be obtained without any analytic integration , by applying numerical monte carlo methods .",
    "an important feature of stripper is its process independence . in the actual calculation ,",
    "general subtraction terms are combined with process dependent amplitudes .",
    "the simplicity of our construction contrasted with the complexity of double - real radiation singularity structure may lead to scepticism .",
    "the present publication is meant to prove that stripper delivers on its promises .",
    "there are many other subtraction schemes for real radiation . at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ,",
    "most calculations are done with the method of @xcite , but other approaches are subject to active development @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . at the nnlo level ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "much has been achieved with sector decomposition @xcite and antenna subtraction @xcite , but there are more specialised methods for colorless states @xcite and , very recently , for massive final states @xcite .",
    "general tools are also being developed in @xcite .",
    "there were , of course , many other proposals @xcite , which have not been completely developed .    to demonstrate the virtues of stripper",
    ", we have chosen hadronic top quark pair production , as it is of great phenomenological relevance , but its theoretical description is still incomplete .",
    "the current state of the art in the field is as follows    1 .",
    "differential cross sections including complete off - shell effects and leptonic decays are known at nlo @xcite ( until recently , they were only available in the narrow - width approximation @xcite ) ; 2 .   fixed",
    "order threshold expansions for the quark - annihilation and gluon - fusion channels are known at nnlo up to constants , both for the total cross section @xcite , and for the invariant mass distribution @xcite ; 3 .",
    "soft - gluon resummation for the previously mentioned channels is understood at the nnll level for the total cross section @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and selected differential distributions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; 4 .",
    "mixed soft - gluon and coulomb resummation is understood at the nnll level as well @xcite ; 5 .",
    "two - loop virtual amplitudes are known analytically in the high - energy limit @xcite , for the planar contributions @xcite , and fermionic contributions in the quark - annihilation channel @xcite ; in the same channel , the full amplitude is known numerically @xcite ; 6 .",
    "one - loop squared amplitudes are known analytically at the nnlo level @xcite ; 7 .   one - loop real - virtual ( one additional massless parton in the final state ) amplitudes have been obtained in the course of several projects connected to top quark pair production in association with jets @xcite ; 8",
    ".   approximations of the one - loop real - virtual amplitudes are known in all singular limits involving only massless partons @xcite ( this is needed for the evaluation of the real - virtual contributions ) .",
    "we are interested in an nnlo calculation .",
    "schematically , the involved partonic cross sections are a sum of three terms mentioned already above @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the double - virtual ( two - loop and one - loop squared ) , @xmath11 the real - virtual ( one - loop with one additional parton ) , and @xmath12 the double - real ( tree - level with two additional partons ) corrections .",
    "we will ignore the need for collinear renormalization , which involves lower order cross sections expanded to higher orders in @xmath5 , the parameter of dimensional regularization .",
    "these have been derived ( although not published ) for the analysis of @xcite .    currently missing are the double - real and real - virtual contributions .",
    "once these are known , one can provide complete nnlo cross sections beyond the known threshold expansions .",
    "the real - virtual contribution has a simpler singularity structure than the double - real , and should be obtainable once the soft - gluon current in the presence of heavy quarks has been derived .    as far as the double - real contribution is concerned , there are many partonic channels , which need to be considered in principle .",
    "nevertheless , current phenomenological applications require the knowledge of the cross sections with gluon - gluon and quark - anti - quark initial states .",
    "this leads to our choice of the following channels @xmath13 we will only consider the case @xmath4 , because the case of identical quarks is expected to be numerically irrelevant . in the present publication",
    ", we will provide numerical values for the cross sections for the four channels as function of @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the phase space , its volume , parameterization and decomposition .",
    "subsequently , we will describe the derivation of the subtraction terms , convergence and cancellation of leading divergences . in section 4 , we will describe the technical details of our implementation , demonstrate its efficiency and describe several tests .",
    "section 5 contains the results of numerical simulations for the four chosen channels .",
    "apart from the main text and conclusions , the publication consists of a number of appendices .",
    "they contain the collinear splitting functions , a discussion of the double - soft limit in the presence of massive partons , another approach to the collinear limit in the double - soft limit , the born cross sections , and finally a list of the software that we have used .",
    "a numerical approach , as the one advocated here , poses substantial problems , when assessing the correctness of both the approach and implementation .",
    "we will , therefore , start by introducing the only truly non - trivial integral that relates to our computation , but can be evaluated entirely analytically : the volume of the phase space .",
    "we are interested in the following class of processes @xmath15 where @xmath16 are initial and @xmath17 final state partons , in particular @xmath18 or @xmath19 , and @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "additionally @xmath22 and as usual @xmath23 throughout this publication we will work in the partonic center - of - mass system .",
    "the phase space measure in @xmath24-dimensions is @xmath25 with @xmath26 as usual .",
    "we wish to evaluate the integral of unity with this measure .",
    "the result will be given as a product of two functions @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the volume of the phase space in the purely massless case @xmath30 which can be easily obtained from the imaginary part of the three - loop massless sunrise diagram @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the @xmath31 function must satisfy two boundary conditions @xmath32 the first of the above equations is just the vanishing of the phase space at threshold , which is located at @xmath33 .",
    "the second follows from the normalization in the massless case , which in turn corresponds to @xmath34 .        in order to obtain @xmath31",
    ", we will use the method of differential equations @xcite . to this end , we exploit again the fact that @xmath31 is given , up to normalization , by the imaginary part of the three - loop sunrise diagram , this time with two massless and two massive lines , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sunrise ] . reducing the mass derivatives of the three occurring master integrals using integration - by - parts identities , we obtain the following two equations",
    "@xmath35 where we have only kept two of the master integrals , @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "notice that @xmath36 s sole purpose is to provide a solvable second order differential equation and a neat boundary condition , which follows again from the vanishing of the phase space at threshold @xmath37 for this reason , we do not even bother specifying its exact definition .    with the three boundary conditions , the solution of the system of differential equations is unique , and can be obtained recursively as a series expansion in @xmath5 . in principle , we need five terms of the expansion corresponding to the five relevant terms of the expansion of the cross section , ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "as the expressions quickly become extremely lengthy , we will only reproduce the first two , and give a high precision numerical value at some benchmark point for the complete expansion is attached to the electronic preprint version of this publication ] .",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the @xmath42 functions are standard harmonic polylogarithms ( hpl ) @xcite .",
    "their initial weight is 2 , but the last term of the expansion we are interested in , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 , contains hpls up to weight six .",
    "we can also obtain the behavior of @xmath31 near threshold , either from the differential equations , or from the actual solution .",
    "the result is @xmath44 the numerical benchmark expansion is chosen at @xmath45 @xmath46 one may wonder why it is not sufficient to test the implementation close to the massless case and avoid the work that led to the above expressions .",
    "the reason is that the presence of large logarithms of the mass , up to @xmath47 , implies a high sensitivity of the result to the value of the small mass .",
    "a point like @xmath45 has no special properties and , therefore , no large cancellations are expected .    using the result for @xmath48 and its two derivatives in @xmath49",
    ", we have a complete set of master integrals and can evaluate the integral of any polynomial in scalar products of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we will find it later useful to have the result for the following integral @xmath53 the value at our benchmark point is @xmath54      we will now introduce a suitable parameterization of the phase space .",
    "we will closely follow the lines of @xcite , where the massless system has been specified . in the next subsection",
    ", we will define a parameterization for the heavy system .",
    "before we give the momentum vectors , let us note that we can always choose them such that their @xmath5-dimensional components vanish .",
    "this is due to the rotational invariance remaining in the system as long as we only have three vectors @xmath55 ( notice that @xmath56 by assumption ) .",
    "therefore , we will specify the vectors , as if they were purely four - dimensional .",
    "the only consequence of the existence of the additional degrees of freedom is the modified form of the phase space measure , which is then sufficient to regulate all singularities",
    ". we will also exploit rotational invariance and space inversion invariance of the matrix elements ( which can also be viewed as @xmath24-dimensional rotation invariance ) to restrict the momenta as follows @xmath57 in the actual monte carlo simulation , the momenta should be rotated randomly around the @xmath58-axis and the sign of @xmath49-axis should also be chosen at random , in order to fill out the complete phase space .    with the above assumptions ,",

    "one of the main ideas of the subtraction scheme @xcite is to change variables in such a way that all collinear limits be parameterized with just two variables , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in order to do so ,",

    ", we have @xmath105 the problem that we face is that once three @xmath106-dimensional momenta of the massless partons have been specified with @xmath5-dimensional components vanishing , we do not have the freedom to keep the latter components of @xmath104 vanishing anymore .",
    "the easiest solution would be to restrict the momenta of the heavy quarks , which are always resolved after all , to lie in the four physical dimensions .",
    "this would simplify the parameterization , but we would loose the possibility to use the integrals derived in section  [ sec : volume ] .",
    "furthermore , to obtain finite partonic cross sections , it is necessary to add collinear counterterms , which are convolutions of splitting functions with lower order cross sections . if we would like to use the results obtained in @xcite for this purpose , we need the heavy quarks in @xmath24-dimensions .",
    "let us , therefore , define the @xmath104 momenta through three spherical angles @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 in principle , the three angles should lie in the range @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , we can assume @xmath111 $ ] and @xmath112 $ ] , as long as we exploit the independence of the results from the sign of @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , without loss of generality , we can set @xmath114 and forget about the @xmath115-dimensional components .",
    "thus we have to work with five - dimensional vectors .",
    "we will soon see that the contribution of those vectors , which have a non - vanishing fifth dimension is suppressed by a power of @xmath5 as one would expect .",

    "( [ eq : betaphase ] ) @xmath120 more interestingly , however , the ratio @xmath121 is of the order @xmath5 , which means that we need a divergent contribution from the integral to obtain a cross section in four dimensions .",

    "one can expect that the additional contribution from @xmath127 will be small in practice .",
    "we will show later that this is indeed the case .    at this point",
    ", we would like to note that the adopted solution to the problem of a @xmath24-dimensional phase space for the heavy quarks is by no means unique .",
    "one could , for example , use the fact that the @xmath5-dimensional components of the heavy quark momentum vectors are only relevant to the terms singular in @xmath5 , which are obtained after one of the massless vectors has been removed ( at least one soft or collinear limit ) .",
    "we then have only two @xmath106-dimensional vectors , and could rotate away the spurious components of @xmath128 .",
    "this approach would only be correct , if the reference frame for the parameterization of @xmath128 were defined in relation to @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "the second branch starting with the dashed line is symmetric to the first . ]    . ]",
    "the last step of our treatment of the phase space is a two - level decomposition according to singularities . at the first level",
    ", we partition the phase space with suitable selector functions .",
    "the latter are defined on the phase space , add up to unity , and regulate part of the divergences . in particular , we introduce a selector function for the triple - collinear sector , in which we allow for collinear divergences due to partons with momenta @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , but not @xmath134 .",
    "there is also a symmetric function that does just the same upon replacement of @xmath131 with @xmath134 , but we ignore it , as its contribution can be recovered without additional computation ( see section  [ sec : implementation ] ) .",
    "moreover , we introduce a selector , which allows for collinear divergences due to @xmath132 being parallel to @xmath131 , or @xmath133 parallel to @xmath134 , but no other configuration .",
    "this function defines the double - collinear sector , and has a symmetric counterpart in @xmath135 , which we again do not discuss any further .",
    "the triple- and double - collinear sectors may be overlapping in the sense that several selector functions do not vanish for a given momentum configuration .",
    "the only condition is that the divergences are properly regulated . in @xcite , we have given two examples of selector functions , which achieve this goal , one for our present problem , and one completely general for any number of massless final states .",
    "apart from numerical efficiency , nothing depends on the choice . in the present work , we define the sectors implicitly as follows    1 .",
    "@xmath136 in the triple - collinear sector ; 2 .",
    "@xmath137 in the double - collinear sector ,    where @xmath138 is an arbitrary parameter , which we will take to be @xmath139 ( we checked independence of some results on this parameter ) .",
    "notice that the sharp cut @xmath140 in both cases is necessary for the later use of symmetries .",
    "moreover , we have defined the conditions through the vectors @xmath61 , because in the strict soft limits the actual momentum vectors vanish and it is impossible to check to which sector they belong .",
    "having simplified the problem as far as the type of collinear singularities is concerned , we will perform a second level decomposition .",
    "the purpose is to factorize the divergences of the propagators in the amplitudes .",
    "the set of offending invariants is @xmath141 assuming that we are only concerned by the collinear singularities , @xmath142 are relevant to the triple - collinear sector , whereas @xmath143 to the double - collinear sector . in case partons",
    "may also become soft , there will be soft - collinear singularities in the double - collinear sector due to @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "purely soft singularities may involve other propagators , in particular the massive , with a general form as follows @xmath146 due to the polynomial form of the singular denominators , it is possible to factorize the divergences with a change of variables in such a way , that each expression be a product of variables to some powers , the variables themselves inducing divergences when vanishing , and a regular function .",
    "this is the well known sector decomposition @xcite .",
    "the difference to the usual treatment is that , due to the process independent nature of singularities in qcd , we do not have to consider abstract expressions , but can view the decomposition as a choice of the order of the soft and collinear limits . a complete schematic representation of the variable transformations , which lead to factorization of divergences and specify the order of singular limits",

    "[ fig : dec2 ] is even simpler , as some of the levels disappear .",
    "note that for each tree , we start with a new set of variables @xmath147 and @xmath148 at the root , and continue with the substitutions down to the leaves . the missing right branches corresponding to @xmath149 can be recovered by changing the order of the final state partons .",

    "nevertheless , one case turns out to be slightly inconvenient . indeed , the double - soft limit followed by the collinear limit of the two soft partons , although obtainable with the formulae of [ sec : soft ] , requires a careful evaluation , because of the presence of an apparent quadratic divergence @xmath199 in eq .",

    "this is justified by colour coherence of soft emission in the collinear limit , which is usually exploited to derive the soft - collinear limit in which a pair of partons become collinear , and a gluon , not belonging to the pair , becomes soft .",

    "one might wonder why the spin correlations survive the soft limit , since they do not at the next - to - leading order .",
    "the reason is that the double - soft limit can not be defined with the momenta of the collinear pair alone , because the splitting functions depend only on the ratio of the energies of the two partons .",
    "therefore , as long as this ratio remains constant , from the point of view of the collinear limit , we are considering two _ hard _ partons .",
