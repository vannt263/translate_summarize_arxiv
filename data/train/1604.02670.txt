    "in this paper we test our method for revealing the traces of non - linear dynamics in the observed x - ray lightcurves on two numerical trajectories , from which one is regular and the other one is chaotic .",
    "we developed and described in details the method in the paper @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to the article by a. janiuk et al in these proceedings to learn more about astrophysical applications of this method . here",
    "we only briefly summarize its key features .",
    "we compute the estimate of rnyi s entropy @xmath0 @xcite using the recurrence analysis for the time series .",
    "this value is compared with the values obtained for @xmath1 surrogates made in such a way , that they share the value distribution and power spectra with the original series ( iaaft surrogates ) .",
    "we use the software package tisean @xcite .",
    "the significance of the non - linearity is given by @xmath2 for chosen recurrence threshold @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of surrogates , which have only short diagonal lines in their recurrence matrix , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the natural logarithms of @xmath0 for the observed and surrogate data , respectively , @xmath7 is the averaged value of the set @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the significance computed from surrogates with enough long lines according to the relation @xmath10    we quantize the results with @xmath11  the average of @xmath12 over a range of @xmath3 .",
    "in general our method can be applied to different kinds of time series , which are produced by some dynamical system . here",
    "we test the method applying it on time series , whose nature is known .",
    "we choose the numerical time series , which describe the motion of geodesic test particle in the field of a static black hole surrounded by a massive thin disc .",
    "the background metric is given by an exact solution of einstein equations and is described in details in @xcite .",
    "the time series are obtained as the numerical solution to the geodesic equation with this metric using the 6th order runge - kutta method as the input data we use the time dependence of the particle s @xmath13-coordinate .",
    "we study two numerical trajectories , orbit @xmath14 being regular and orbit @xmath15 chaotic , whose poincar surface of section and time dependence of @xmath13 coordinate is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] .",
    "the two selected trajectories belong to the regular island ( @xmath14 ) and chaotic sea ( @xmath15 ) depicted in fig .",
    "19 of @xcite .",
    "we sample the trajectory with @xmath16 for @xmath17 yielding the data set of @xmath18 points .",
    "the first minimum of mutual information is at @xmath19 for @xmath14 and @xmath20 for @xmath15 , hence we adopt @xmath21 for both orbits .",
    "we generate the set of surrogates and perform the analysis in the same way as for the observed x - ray lightcurves in @xcite .",
    "at first we investigate the dependence of the length of the longest diagonal line present in the recurrence matrix @xmath22 on @xmath3 . as expected , the regular trajectory yields very long diagonal lines for small thresholds and @xmath22 goes up almost to the maximal value @xmath23 .",
    "the surrogates behave in a similar way for a little bit higher threshold .",
    "this is due to the way how the surrogate data are constructed , as they have exactly the same value distribution but they reproduce the spectrum only approximately depending also on the available length of the data set . in case of regular motion , very narrow peaks are in the spectrum and the error in reproducing such spectrum causes the very long diagonal lines to be broken .",
    "this higher value of @xmath3 for surrogates corresponds to the size of the neighbourhood needed for covering the small discrepancies of the surrogates .",
    "the chaotic orbit @xmath15 provides shorter lines , so that @xmath24 for the range of thresholds we used .",
    "yet it is significantly larger than the corresponding values for surrogates . only for very high thresholds ,",
    "the difference decreases .         because in reality the data always contain some level of noise , we take the normalized times series for @xmath14 and @xmath15 and we add a white noise with zero mean and increasing variance @xmath25 and rescale the resulting data back to zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the surrogates created from the regular orbit with added noise reproduce the spectrum better than for the regular orbit alone ( normalised rms discrepancy between the exact spectrum and the exact amplitude stage reported by the surrogates procedure decreases from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : preg_lmax ] the plots of @xmath22 versus @xmath3 for the added white noise with @xmath28 are shown . the presence of noise shifts up the needed threshold for some lines to occur in rp . for the regular orbit @xmath14",
    "there is no significant difference from the surrogates . for chaotic orbit",
    "@xmath15 the threshold is also shifted to higher values , but the difference from the surrogates remains .",
    "our posed null hypothesis is that the data are the product of linearly autocorrelated process and because the regular trajectory can be treated as such ( e.g. in the case of a periodic orbit , the points separated by the period @xmath29 are the same ) , the significance is small . on the other hand ,",
    "the chaotic trajectory can not be treated as linear dynamics and yields high significance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : preg_lmax2 ] the estimate of @xmath0 and the significance of its comparison with the surrogates is given for the increasing level of noise ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we note , that for low levels of noise the regular orbit yields much lower value of @xmath0 , which can serve as the differentiation between chaotic and regular motion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however for increasing strength of the noise , the regular orbit @xmath14 seems to be more affected than the chaotic one , providing higher @xmath0 for the noise levels @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the significance for the regular orbit drops down bellow one quickly , while the significance for chaotic orbit reaches values around 10 for low noise levels , near 6 for intermediate noise levels and stays around 4 for high noise levels , even up to the case , when the variance of the noise is the same as the variance of the data .",
    "the test of the method for finding non - linear dynamics in dynamical systems based on the observed time series shows that for a given length of observational data set ( 5000 points ) we can expect that chaotic dynamics would yield values of significance between 2 - 10 depending on the strength of the noise .",
    "regular motion would not provide significant result , because even low level of noise present in the measured data destroys the differences with respect to the surrogates ."
