    "the accretion disks around black holes with rather high accretion rates @xmath0 are plausible candidates for the central engine of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "a large amount of neutrinos can be produced in such hyperaccretion flows .",
    "they will then collide , annihilate , and produce a fireball @xcite , which is one popular model for grbs .",
    "in addition to the fireball model , another type of models for the central engine of grbs is magnetically dominated ones .",
    "recent _ fermi _ observations seem to suggest that the latter is more favored @xcite .",
    "the leading magnetic model is the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite , which requires a large - scale open magnetic field connecting the black hole and an external astrophysical load .",
    "this model also tends to generate a continuous jet .",
    "it is shown in this case that the energy dissipation via magnetized shocks in the jet is not efficient enough to explain observations @xcite .",
    "the magnetic turbulent reconnection is proposed instead @xcite .",
    "stimulated by the observations of episodic jets , @xcite recently proposed a magnetic episodic jet model for grbs .",
    "different from the bz mechanism , in this model , the jet is intrinsically episodic , i.e. , in the form of discrete magnetized blobs .",
    "reconnection can be easily triggered when they collide and grbs are then naturally produced .    in this paper , we focus on the fireball model .",
    "the calculations by @xcite have shown that this hyperaccretion disk has an `` ignition '' radius @xmath3 within which radius the neutrino production become efficient and the disk is neutrino - cooling dominated ; while outside which radius the accretion flow is advection dominated .",
    "it has been found that except in the very inner part of the disk ( i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole ) , the disk is optically thin to neutrinos in the radial direction , therefore the neutrinos produced at one radius can travel for a long distance in the disk before they are absorbed or scattered .",
    "these neutrinos can thus be absorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and heat the disk there , as we will show below in this paper .",
    "we call this effect `` global neutrino heating '' .",
    "this process has been ignored in previous works . in this paper",
    "we focus on this `` global neutrino heating '' in the neutrino cooling accretion flow , we find that around the `` ignition '' radius @xmath3 , the global neutrino heating rate could be comparable to or even stronger than the local viscous heating rate thus is non - negligible .",
    "we note that similar `` global compton scattering '' effect of photons has been studied in the context of optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow @xcite .    in section 2 , we briefly review the accretion disk model that we are considering .",
    "then in section 3 we show how to calculate the global neutrino heating rate and the neutrino radiation pressure .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the numerical results .",
    "a brief summary and discussion are given in section 5 .",

    "the neutrino cooling is important and the disk can be regarded as a neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ) .",
    "the disk properties in this region can be approximately described by @xcite @xmath9 at the outer disk , @xmath10 , when the temperature falls down and the mean electron energy becomes lower than @xmath11 , the neutrino emission then rapidly switches off and the neutrino cooling becomes inefficient . at this region ,",

    "in a ndaf model , most of the neutrinos are produced at the inner region of the accretion flow .",
    "since the optical depth for neutrino is small in the radial direction , these neutrinos will be able to travel for a long distance and transfer their energy and momentum to the accretion matter at large radii .",
    "this `` global neutrino interaction '' effect has been neglected in previous works and its significance is the focus of the present paper .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that if @xmath18 is not too small , @xmath157 , the global neutrino heating rate will be comparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate at @xmath158 ( here @xmath3 is the `` ignition '' radius , i.e. , the boundary between the inner ndaf and the outer adaf ) .",
    "consequently , the temperature of the adaf may become higher than the virial one .",
    "this implies that the flow outside of @xmath3 ca nt be accreted and the accretion will be highly suppressed once the accretion flow inside of @xmath3 is accreted .",
    "we found that the accretion timescale of ndaf at @xmath3 is typically 1 second .",
    "this means that the ndaf model will not be able to explain the long grbs .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that our calculations are based on the simple analytical solutions of ndaf and adaf and are `` local '' , therefore the results should only be taken as preliminary . to get a more precise answer to the significance of the global neutrino interaction effect , a self - consistent and global calculation with this effect included",
    "is required .",
    "the readers can refer to yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ) for the details of such a calculation .",
    "here we only briefly review the approach .",
    "the first step is to get the global solution of the set of differential equations describing the superaccretion flows ( e.g. , popham et al .",
    "no global neutrino heating term is included in this step .",
    "then we follow a similar approach as presented in this paper to calculate the global neutrino heating rate at each radius @xmath159 .",
    "then we include this term in the energy equations of the accretion flow and try to solve their global solution again .",
    "based on this new global solution we can calculate @xmath159 again and compare with the result obtained in the last step . if they are not equal to each other , we replace @xmath159 with the new one and repeat the above procedure until convergence is achieved .",
    "in addition to the `` local '' nature of our calculation mentioned above , another caveat of our work is that we do not consider outflow in both ndafs and adafs .",
    "the radiation - megnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations to optically thick adafs show the existence of outflow @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is that the radiation force is found to exceed the gravitational force at the surface of the flow .",
    "we are not aware of any theoretical work focused on the study of possible outflow in ndafs .",
    "however , we note that the `` micro blandford - payne '' mechanism recently proposed by @xcite to explain the origin of outflow in an optically thin adaf should work for any accretion flow in which the magnetic turbulence associated with the magnetorotational instability is the mechanism of transporting angular momentum .",
    "this mechanism is very similar to the blandford & payne one in the sense that the magnetic centrifugal force drives the outflow .",
    "the difference is that no large - scale open field is required here ( see also bai & stone ( 2013 , preprint ) for the shearing box simulation analysis ) .",
    "the initial simulations to the radiatively efficient standard thin disk , which is physically similar to the ndaf , do show the existence of outflow @xcite .",
    "however , all these are our speculation since the parameters of accretion flows here are largely different from the works mentioned above .",
    "it is hard to estimate the effect of outflow on the significance of global neutrino interaction .",
    "on one hand , the inward decrease of accretion rate will make the neutrino production in the inner region of ndaf weaker in relative to the viscous heating rate at @xmath3 .",
    "this will make the global neutrino effect less important .",
    "but on the other hand , the inward decrease of accretion rate means that the radial optical depth will become smaller which enhances the received neutrino flux at @xmath3 .",
    "the final result requires detailed numerical calculation .",
