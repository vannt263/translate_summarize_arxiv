    "in the last decade semi - analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hydrodynamical simulations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) have been used to show that cold dark matter models with a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of initial , adiabatic , gaussian fluctuations are very successful in reproducing the large body of high - quality observations of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the physical picture that has emerged is that the forest arises in a network of sheets , filaments , and halos , which give rise to absorption lines of progressively higher column densities .",
    "the low column density absorption lines ( @xmath2 at @xmath3 ) , arise in a smoothly fluctuating intergalactic medium ( igm ) of moderate overdensity ( @xmath4 ) , and contain most of the baryons in the universe . on large scales",
    "the gas traces the dark matter and observations of the ly@xmath0  forest can be used to study the large - scale distribution of matter , while on small scales hydrodynamical effects are important and the detailed line profiles can be used to reconstruct the thermal history of the igm . in this contribution",
    "i will show that the modern picture of the forest can be derived directly from the observations using straightforward physical arguments , without making any assumptions about the presence of dark matter , the mechanism for structure formation or the precise cosmological model .",
    "this work is described in more detail in a recent publication @xcite .",
    "consider an ( optically thin ) self - gravitating gas cloud of arbitrary shape that is intersected by our line of sight to a background qso .",
    "let @xmath5 be the characteristic total hydrogen number density of the absorber , i.e. , the density weighted by the neutral hydrogen column density and let @xmath6 be the characteristic size of the absorber , i.e. , the size over which the density is of order @xmath5 .",
    "regardless of whether the cloud as a whole is in dynamical equilibrium , it will in general not be far from local hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the local jeans length .",
    "if @xmath9 , then the cloud will expand or evaporate and equilibrium will be restored on a sound - crossing time scale . if @xmath10 , then the cloud is jeans unstable and will fragment or shock and equilibrium will be restored on a dynamical time scale . note that this argument breaks down if the relevant time scale is larger than the hubble time , because in that case there simply has not been sufficient time to establish equilibrium . since @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "this is true for underdense absorbers .",
    "such absorbers have sizes greater than the sound horizon and can be regarded as a `` fluctuating gunn - peterson effect '' .",
    "systematic departures from local hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath13 ) also occur in clouds confined by external pressure ( but the large cloud sizes derived from observations of quasar pairs rule out the possibility that a significant fraction of the forest arises in pressure confined clouds @xcite ) , and in rotationally supported clouds whose spin axis is nearly perpendicular to our sight line .",
    "combining the condition of local hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath14 , with the expression for the neutral fraction in an optically thin plasma , @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the temperature and @xmath17 is the hydrogen photoionization rate ) , yields expressions for the density and size of an absorber as a function of its neutral hydrogen column density @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fraction of the mass in gas ( excluding stars and molecules ) . from the line widths of the absorption lines",
    "it is known that the temperature is roughly consistent with that expected from photoionization heating , @xmath20 .",
    "studies of the proximity effect estimate @xmath21 at @xmath3 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the density - column density relation agrees with published results from hydrodynamical simulations to within a factor of a few , about as well as different simulations agree with each other .",
    "the sizes of the absorbers have not been investigated in detail with simulations , but equation [ eq : l ] does agree with the sizes derived from observations of multiple sight lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    using equation [ eq : nhi ] to compute the neutral fraction as a function of column density , we can compute @xmath1 , the contribution of the ly@xmath0  forest to the cosmic baryon density , directly from the observed column density distribution : @xmath24 figure 1a shows the observed column density distribution at @xmath25 and the single power law fit of hu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( dashed line ) .",
    "integration of this column density distribution according to equation [ eq : omegab ] , using @xmath26 , yields @xmath27 for @xmath28 , confirming that at high @xmath29 most of the baryons are in the diffuse igm .",
    "figure 1b shows the derived mass distribution , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the shape of the mass distribution clearly reflects the deviations from a single power law column density distribution and agrees reasonably well with the actual mass distribution in a hydrodynamical simulation ( solid line ) , kindly provided by t.  theuns .",
    "the agreement becomes even more impressive if we compare with the distribution of gas that has a temperature @xmath31 ( dashed line ) , low enough for collisional ionization to be ineffective .",
    "this good agreement suggests that the observed structure in the igm formed through gravitational instability in an expanding universe , as is the case in the simulation .",
    "the shape of the mass distribution derived from the observations also suggests a simple physical interpretation for the deviations from the single power law in the observed column density distribution , whose origin was not yet understood .",
    "the steepening at @xmath32 reflects the fall - off in the density distribution due to the onset of rapid , non - linear collapse at @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the flattening at @xmath34 can be attributed to the flattening of the density distribution at @xmath35 due to the virialization of collapsed matter .    the evolution of the shape of the column density distribution can now also be explained . from @xmath3 to @xmath23 , the slope of the column density distribution is found to steepen for @xmath36@xmath37 and to flatten for @xmath38@xmath39 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if gravitational instability is responsible for the shape of the gas density distribution , then this distribution will be similar at @xmath23 and @xmath3 , provided it is expressed as a function of the density relative to the cosmic mean .",
    "hence , the change in the slope of the column density distribution must mainly be due to the evolution of the function @xmath40 , which is determined by the expansion of the universe and the evolution of the ionizing background .",
    "equation [ eq : nhi ] shows that @xmath41 .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density corresponding to a fixed density contrast is thus about a factor @xmath4250 lower at @xmath23 than at @xmath3 , and this can account for the evolution in the observed distribution .",
    "this work demonstrates that the main aspects of the physical picture of the ly@xmath0  forest , including the facts that the absorbers are extended , of low overdensity , and contain a large fraction of the baryons , can all be derived directly from the observations using straightforward analytical arguments , without making assumptions about the presence of dark matter , the mechanism for structure formation , or the precise cosmology .",
    "although this analysis is essentially model - independent , the shape of the derived mass distribution strongly suggests that gravitational instability in an expanding universe is responsible for the distribution of matter in the igm , thus lending credence to the use of ab - initio hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the detailed properties of the forest and their dependence on the parameters of the models ."
