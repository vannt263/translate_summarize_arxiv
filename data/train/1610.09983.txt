    "graphs known as adinkras were proposed by faux and gates in @xcite as a fruitful way to investigate off - shell representations of the super poincar algebra .",
    "adinkras are graphs whose vertices represent the particles in a supermultiplet and whose edges correspond to the supersymmetry generators . in combinatorial terms , adinkras are @xmath0-regular , edge @xmath0-colored bipartite graphs with signs assigned to the edges and heights assigned to the vertices , subject to certain conditions .",
    "details can be found in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "it is useful to think of an adinkra as consisting of a _ chromotopology _ , which captures the underlying bipartite graph with its @xmath0-coloring , together with two more compatible structures : an _ odd dashing _ , which marks each edge with a sign , and a _ height assignment _ , which labels each of the vertices with an integer .",
    "a complete characterization of chromotopologies was achieved in @xcite . for each @xmath0",
    ", there is a natural chromotopology on the hamming cube @xmath1^n$ ] , with vertices labeled by elements of @xmath2 .",
    "the one - skeleton of the hamming cube serves as a `` universal cover '' for arbitrary chromotopologies , the covering map being realized by taking cosets with respect to doubly even binary linear error correcting codes @xmath3 .    in part",
    "i of this paper , we described a construction that produced a riemann surface out of the underlying chromotopology of an adinkra @xmath4 once we fixed a _",
    "rainbow _ ( a cyclic ordering of the @xmath0-colors ) .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the set of all pairs @xmath6 where @xmath4 is an adinkra and @xmath7 is a rainbow . if @xmath8 , the riemann surface constructed in @xcite will be denoted by @xmath9 ; we often denote the riemann surface associated to the @xmath0-cube simply by @xmath10 , and we will make the rainbow explicit if needed .    the construction was described explicitly in three different ways .",
    "the first approach used grothendieck s theory of _ dessins denfants _ , and we described the monodromy group of the riemann surface over a base @xmath11 . for this construction ,",
    "a choice of cyclic orientation of the edges incident to each vertex had to be made .",
    "we decided to orient the edges incident to a white vertex in the order of our chosen rainbow , and we oriented the edges in the opposite way for black vertices .",
    "this choice gave rise to a riemann surface that _ minimally _ embedded the adinkra ( with respect to genus ) , a fact that was not proved in @xcite , but follows easily from euler s classical polyhedron formula @xcite .",
    "by design , the structure map factored through a degree-@xmath0 mapping of the riemann sphere to itself ; the image of the adinkra on this sphere is a graph with one white vertex , one black vertex , and one edge of each color joining the two .",
    "this allowed us to consider all of the riemann surfaces constructed from adinkras as branched covers of this `` beachball '' , which we denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "one advantage of this approach was the following : the deck - transformation group from the hypercube surface to the beach ball is the maximally even code of length @xmath0 .",
    "adinkras corresponding to doubly - even codes are then the free quotients by the doubly - even code viewed as a subgroup of deck transformations .",
    "not only is this an attractive feature from the point of view of covering space ( i.e. , the covers are unbranched ) , but this also reflects the importance / elegance of the connection between adinkras and doubly - even codes .    the second description was done via fuchsian uniformizations .",
    "we _ explicitly _ determined the fuchsian subgroups that gave rise to our surfaces .",
    "once again , it is possible to make this explicit because of the connection to doubly - even codes .    finally , we described the hypercube riemann surfaces as a complete intersection of quadrics in projective space , and the intermediate surfaces as quotients by deck transformations .",
    "this presentation yielded a description of the deck transformations over the beach ball as sign changes on coordinates with the centers of the quadrilateral faces corresponding to the coordinate hyperplane sections .",
    "this model is visibly defined over a ( real subfield of a ) cyclotomic field , but it was shown using the theory of galois descent that the curves are in fact definable over the rational numbers .",
    "a priori , the curves were definable over @xmath13 because of the belyi map , but in fact these curves are much more special  this is a striking reflection of the symmetry appearing in supersymmetry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the riemann surfaces constructed from adinkra graphs share many of the properties of the most special riemann surfaces studied in arithmetic geometry .",
    "for example , the famous fricke - macbeath curve of genus seven shares much in common with with the curves associated to the @xmath14 codes .",
    "such curves are genus seven covers of the seven - pointed sphere , are defined over @xmath15 , have monodromy group isomorphic to @xmath16 , and have jacobian abelian varieties that split completely up to isogeny into elliptic curve factors .",
    "the methods of computing the isogenous decomposition for adinkra riemann surfaces developed in this paper , however , permit one to show that these two riemann surfaces are nevertheless _ not _ isomorphic .",
    "one clarification also needs to be made .",
    "we had claimed that @xmath17-symmetry produces isomorphic riemann surfaces .",
    "unfortunately , this is not true all of the time , although it _ is _ always true for the @xmath0-cube , and the proof found in @xcite is correct .",
    "certain @xmath17-symmetries will yield isomorphic riemann surfaces .",
    "one obvious such @xmath17-symmetry is the rotation @xmath17-symmetry , where each edge is given the next color in the rainbow . that this produces an isomorphic riemann surface",
    "can best be seen by observing that such a rainbow change is induced by any deck transformation that lifts the rotation morphism on the beachball @xmath12 , as described in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the rotation symmetry , it is safe to act on the rainbow via permutations that stabilize the associated doubly - even code .",
    "that is , such permutations _ will _ give rise to isomorphic riemann surfaces . a proof of this fact is in appendix a.    in the present paper we complete the passage from supersymmetry algebras , through discrete structures ( adinkras ) , to _ geometry _ by naturally interpreting both of the remaining adinkra structures in geometric terms .",
    "the adinkra graph on the riemann surface defines a _ dimer model _ , and using work of cimasoni - reshetikhin @xcite and the classification of odd - dashings via cubical cohomology in @xcite we show that the odd - dashings correspond to special spin structures on the riemann surface , and hence to _ super riemann surfaces_.    from the height assignments on the adinkra graphs we construct _ discrete morse functions _ in the sense of banchoff @xcite on the topological surface . using this description , we produce a set of _ morse divisors _ on the riemann surface which capture the topological properties of the height assignments .",
    "we provide an explicit description of the jacobian abelian varieties of the adinkra riemann surfaces , and the set of points on these described by the classes of the morse divisors .",
    "we conclude with some first comments on the lessons learned from considering the full geometric package coming from supersymmetry via adinkras .",
    "we would like to thank s.j .",
    "gates , jr .",
    ", p. green , t. hbsch , and g. landweber for extended discussions and useful suggestions while writing this paper .",
    "the argument in appendix b is a modification of p. green s proof recast in the language of kani - rosen needed for our purposes .",
    "cd and jk acknowledge support from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , the pacific institute for the mathematical sciences , and the campobassi professorship at the university of maryland .",
    "in this section , we will show how odd dashings on an adinkra correspond to spin structures on the associated riemann surfaces .",
    "whereas in the first part of this paper our focus was on the construction of a riemann surface @xmath9 from the chromotopology of the adinkra graph @xmath4 , we now make critical use of both the embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath9 and of the odd dashing structure on @xmath4 .",
    "cimasoni and reshetikhin have shown that kasteleyn orientations on a graph embedded in a riemann surface are in one - to - one correspondence with spin structures once a perfect matching , or _ dimer configuration _ , of the edges has been fixed @xcite .",
    "the adinkra @xmath4 embedded in @xmath9 comes with @xmath0 natural choices for dimer configurations by considering the subset of edges of a fixed color , thereby allowing us to use the theory of kasteleyn orientations on graphs embedded in a riemann surface developed in @xcite .    before constructing spin structures from odd dashings , we review the cubical complex associated to an adinkra that was used to classify the set of odd dashings on an adinkra in @xcite .",
    "there are striking similarities to the structure of the set of all such odd dashing , as well as the obstruction to their existence when considering graphs corresponding to even codes , not just adinkras . these similarities  together with the fact that the riemann surface with embedded graph from the first part of this paper provides exactly what cimasoni and reshetikhin use for their construction  inspired us to associate spin structures to odd dashings in the first place .",
    "let @xmath18 be the unit interval , and @xmath19 the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube .",
    "the hypercube @xmath19 has a natural cw - complex structure with @xmath20 cells corresponding to the elements of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a formal symbol for the unit interval .",
    "the dimension of the cell corresponding to @xmath23 is the number of @xmath24 for which @xmath25 . the adinkra @xmath26 corresponding to the hypercube is the @xmath27-skeleton of @xmath19 in this cell complex .",
    "the white and black vertices correspond to the @xmath28-cells with an even , respectively , odd number of @xmath27 s .",
    "an edge is a @xmath27-cell @xmath29 , and is colored @xmath30 for the unique entry for which @xmath25",
    ".    we will be interested in cubical homology with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 as coefficient rings .",
    "let @xmath33 be the free abelian group ( or @xmath32-module ) generated by the @xmath34-dimensional cells .",
    "given a cell @xmath35 , an integer @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , the replacement operator @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 these replacement operators are used in @xcite to define boundary operators on the associated chain complex .",
    "for each @xmath40 , the reflection map @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 now let @xmath43 be a binary code of length @xmath0 , and for each @xmath44 , set @xmath45 in this way , the code @xmath43 acts naturally on the cells of @xmath19 and , in particular , on its @xmath27-skeleton .",
    "taking for @xmath43 the doubly - even code associated to @xmath4 , the quotient of the @xmath27-skeleton by @xmath43 is identified with @xmath4 .",
    "since the boundary operators commute with the above reflection operators , the complex of cells in the quotient has the structure of a cw - complex , which we call the _ cubcical complex _ of @xmath4 .",
    "the homology groups of the cubical complex will be denoted by @xmath46 and called the cubical homology groups ; the cubical cohomology groups are defined dually .",
    "let @xmath4 be an adinkra , and let @xmath43 be the associated doubly even binary linear code .",
    "then we have :    1 .",

    "@xmath49 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath50 .",
    "the first and third isomorphisms following from the connectedness of the cubical complex .",
    "the calculation of the first homology group follows from the fact that @xmath19 is universal cover of the cubical complex of @xmath4 and that the covering group is naturally isomorphic to the code @xmath43 .",
    "the details of this argument , as well as the computation of cohomology group can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .      while the cubical complexes described above are interesting objects to study , it is not natural to give them a manifold structure .",
    "our construction in @xcite of course _ does _ yield a manifold and , in this section , we compare these two objects by defining a topological embedding of the riemann surface inside the cubical complex .",
    "let @xmath51 .",
    "there is an inclusion of topological spaces @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cubical complex of @xmath4 .",
    "choose a white vertex @xmath54 and map it to @xmath55 in the cubical complex . if @xmath56 is another vertex , then @xmath57 for some uniquely determined @xmath58 ; map @xmath56 to @xmath59 in the cubical complex .",
    "this defines @xmath60 on the @xmath28-skeleton . by construction ,",
    "two vertices that are adjacent by an edge of a given color in @xmath61 will map to two vertices that are adjacent via an edge of the same color .",
    "this shows how to extend @xmath60 to the @xmath27-skeleton .",
    "it is injective because there are no double edges , so @xmath60 is an isomorphism on the @xmath27-skeleton .",
    "finally , @xmath60 is extended to the @xmath62-skeleton by mapping each @xmath63 colored face to the corresponding @xmath63 colored face in the cubical complex that has the corresponding boundary edges .",
    "this defines the inclusion on all of @xmath9 .",
    "the above proposition allows us to identify @xmath9 ( as a topological space ) as a subset of the cubical complex .",
    "it follows that @xmath9 inherits the structure of cubical set from the cubical complex for @xmath4 , and we may therefore compute the homology groups of @xmath9 via the associated chain complex .",
    "the inclusion @xmath52 induces an isomorphism of homology in degree @xmath28 , and a surjection in degree @xmath27 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath64 is the subspace @xmath65 generated by the images of all @xmath62-colored loops on the adinkra @xmath61 . in particular , using the isomorphism @xmath48 , we have an exact sequence @xmath66&l\\ar[r]&h_1(x_\\mathcal{a},\\mathbf{z})\\ar[r]&c\\ar[r]&0}.\\ ] ]    the inclusion is an isomorphism on the @xmath27-skeleton , whence the isomorphisms in degree @xmath28 .",
    "now consider the map @xmath67 . to see that @xmath68 is surjective in degree @xmath27 , we use the fact that @xmath69 is generated by the cycles @xmath70 for @xmath71 , where @xmath43 is the code associated to @xmath4 , and @xmath70 is the cycle that starts at some fixed vertex @xmath72 and traverses the edges of each color corresponding the non - zero entries of @xmath73 in sequence @xcite .",
    "these cycles lie in @xmath9 , showing that @xmath60 induces a surjection in homology . to determine the kernel , consider the following commutative diagram coming form the chain complexes",

    "it follows that @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the image of @xmath79 is , by definition , the subspace generated by the images of all @xmath62-colored loops on @xmath4 , whence the result .",
    "our ultimate goal for the rest of this section is to show that the odd dashing on an adinkra gives rise to a spin structure on @xmath9 . in order to do this",
    ", we use the work of cimansoni and reshetikhin @xcite ; in their geometric proof of the pfaffian formula for closed riemann surfaces , they obtain a precise relationship between kasteleyn orientations on a graph with dimer configuration and ( discrete ) spin structures .",
    "we review the necessary details below .",
    "let @xmath80 be a riemann surface and @xmath81 an embedded graph that induces a cellular decomposition of @xmath80 .",
    "an _ orientation _ of the edges of @xmath82 is an assignment of a direction to each edge .",
    "the orientation @xmath83 is called _ kasteleyn _ if the following parity condition holds : for each face @xmath84 of @xmath82 , oriented counterclockwise , there is an odd number of edges of @xmath84 whose orientation does not agree with that of @xmath83 .",
    "given an orientation @xmath83 on @xmath82 , and a vertex @xmath85 , the _ vertex switch at @xmath85 of @xmath83 _ is the orientation @xmath86 obtained from @xmath83 by reversing the orientations at each edge incident to @xmath85 .",

    "on the other hand , each of the black vertices must map to one of the two points with @xmath359-coordinate @xmath362 , the image of @xmath363 under the mbius transformation .",
    "these two points are additive inverses of each other , and we will have three of the black vertices mapping to one point , and two black vertices mapping to the other .",
    "it follows that image of the divisor @xmath364 is equal to one of these two points . using sage",
    ", we see that both of these points have _ infinite _ order in the group law on @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , the push - forward @xmath365 is the sum of a point of infinite order and a point of order @xmath224 , and is therefore not trivial .",
    "this shows that @xmath340 can not be principal , and so @xmath120 and @xmath241 are not linearly equivalent .",
    "while the morse divisor classes do not always give rise to the anti - canonical class , the above examples illustrate the fact that the set of all morse divisor classes on a fixed adinkra naturally give rise to a subset of points lying on the associated jacobian . note that this subset of points is not , in general , a subgroup of the jacobian  we saw in example 4.3.2 that we can obtain points of infinite order in the jacobian despite the fact that there are only finitely many height functions up to shifting , and thus only finitely many points arising from morse divisor classes .",
    "fix an adinkra chromotopology @xmath9 , and let @xmath366 denote the morse divisor associated to the valise height function .",
    "the mapping @xmath367 induces a well - defined map from the set of height - functions , up to shifting , to the jacobian of @xmath9 .",
    "it was remarked earlier that the morse divisor of a height function is left invariant if we shift the height - function by a constant . from the fact that each morse divisor has the same degree , namely @xmath368",
    ", it follows that the difference @xmath369 is a degree-@xmath28 divisor for every height function @xmath370 .",
    "the class of this difference in @xmath371 is therefore a well - defined point in the jacobian .",
    "in this paper we have completed the canonical construction of a geometry associated with the @xmath0-extended one - dimensional super poincar algebra via adinkra graphs . that a naturally defined riemann surface could be attached to the adinkra chromotopology as in @xcite was already surprising .",
    "that the remaining two adinkra structures , the odd - dashing and the height assignment , also correspond so cleanly to spin structures and discrete morse functions / divisors , respectively , on this riemann surface is truly remarkable .",
    "we have succeeded in showing that the 1d shadows of supermultiplets canonically define a geometric package consisting of super riemann surfaces with morse divisors !",
    "it is important to note that its derivation purely from the @xmath0-extended poincar superalgebra means that this geometry does not _ a priori _ have a pre - determined role to play in any particular supersymmetric physical theory .",
    "nevertheless , one can reasonably expect geometrized adinkras to appear in some form in _ every _ context where the requisite amount of supersymmetry is present .",
    "first evidence for this is provided by the geometrized adinkra itself .",
    "both the spin structure and morse function restrict to lagrangian ( real ) curves .",
    "it is striking that this is exactly the data needed to construct the wrapped fukaya category for the noncommutative homological mirror construction for punctured riemann surfaces .",
    "a full exploration of the connection between the fundamental building blocks of supersymmetry and the simplest fully - functional model of homological mirror symmetry is underway @xcite .",

    "these choices give two chromotopologies @xmath234 and @xmath376 ; in this appendix we show that that the riemann surfaces @xmath9 and @xmath377 are isomorphic .",
    "to prove this fact we will show that the monodromy representations for the two surfaces are globally conjugate .    since @xmath378 ,",
    "the underlying adinkra graphs are identical and we may therefore label the vertices with the elements of @xmath379 . if @xmath380 denotes the maximal even subcode , then the white vertices correspond to the cosets in @xmath381 , and the black vertices correspond to the remaining cosets ; in what follows , we will use @xmath382 and @xmath290 to denote the set of white and black vertices respectively .",
    "denote by @xmath383 the edge of color @xmath60 incident to the white vertex @xmath384 .    for simplicity , we assume that the rainbow @xmath17 is given by @xmath385 .",
    "then , the monodromy over @xmath28 and @xmath27 for the riemann surface @xmath9 is given by @xmath386 where @xmath387 is the standard basis vector of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these monodromy permutations are elements of the symmetric group on the set @xmath388 .",
    "the monodromy for @xmath377 is written down similarly using the rainbow @xmath389 .",
    "we denote the corresponding permutations by @xmath390 .",

    "the map @xmath393 preserves the hamming weight and , by definition , @xmath394 .",
    "let @xmath395 be the permutation in @xmath396 given by @xmath397 then , we have @xmath398 because the cycles in the above product are disjoint , and can therefore be reordered in the product , it is clear that the right hand side is @xmath390 .    similarly , we have @xmath399 note that @xmath400 it follows from this that @xmath401 , and so the monodromies are globally conjugate .",
    "the result is a consequence of the kani - rosen decomposition theorem @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath402 and @xmath403 are two distinct subgroups of index @xmath62 containing the doubly even code @xmath43 , then @xmath402 and @xmath403 commute with each other since they are subgroups of @xmath404 , and the group generated by @xmath402 and @xmath403 is all of @xmath404 .",
    "we have @xmath405 since @xmath406 . in particular , the subgroups @xmath407 commute and the quotient by the group generated by them is the beachball @xmath12 of genus @xmath28 .",

    "the following argument is a modification of a proof of this fact found by p. green .",
    "let @xmath408 denote the usual generating set for the maximally even code @xmath404 . as described earlier , the index @xmath62 subgroups of @xmath404 that contain @xmath43 are in one - to - one correspondence with the non - trivial homomorphisms @xmath409 , of which there are precisely @xmath410 , where @xmath411 .",
