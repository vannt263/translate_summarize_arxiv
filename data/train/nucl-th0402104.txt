    "diffusion processes take place in a variety of problems @xcite .",
    "the concept has recently been applied to theoretically describing the synthesis of superheavy elements @xcite .",
    "it is now well accepted that it is not sufficient for the two nuclei in heavy - ion collisions to overcome the fusion ( i.e. , the coulomb ) barrier in order to form a heavy compound nucleus such as superheavy elements .",
    "since the conditional saddle is located inside the fusion barrier for heavy - ion collisions between two heavy nuclei , two nuclei have to further progress inwards to approach inside the conditional saddle .",
    "the idea of refs .",
    "@xcite , called fluctuation - dissipation dynamics , is to describe the time evolution from the fusion barrier to the conditional saddle as a diffusion process .    though this approach is very attractive and",
    "is offering much useful information , one needs to examine the applicability of one of the basic assumptions made so far , i.e. , the use of the standard fluctuation - dissipation theorem which holds at high temperatures to relate the diffusion coefficients to the friction coefficients .",
    "since superheavy elements are stabilized by shell correction energies , one has to synthesize them at reasonably low energies , as low as 1 mev or below . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature of the conditional saddle is also of the order of 1 mev .",
    "it is thus required to carefully study quantum effects .",
    "an interesting issue is to explore the connection between the diffusion and friction coefficients in the diffusion process along a potential barrier under such circumstances .",
    "though the generalization of the einstein relation to the case of diffusion along a potential well is well known , the modification in the case of a diffusion along a potential barrier has so far been discussed only in a limited number of papers @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine this quantum effect caused by the finite curvature of the potential barrier and by the low temperature aspect of the diffusion process . to this end",
    ", we first develop a novel quantum diffusion theory which leads to a fokker - planck equation with non - markovian transport coefficients .",
    "we then apply it to the situation relevant to the synthesis of superheavy elements .",
    "we will show that the quantum effects , especially the non - markovian effects , are very important .    in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly sketch the derivation of the fokker - planck equation with non - markovian transport coefficients , which include quantum effects . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the quantum effects on the diffusion coefficient . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the formalism to analyze the quantum effects by assuming the parameters which are relevant to describe the diffusion process in the synthesis of superheavy elements .",
    "we summarize the paper in sec .",
    "we derive the required diffusion equation by extending the quasilinear response theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite so as to include the curvature of the potential barrier .",
    "details of the derivation will be published elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we sketch the main steps : ( 1 ) we start form the von neumann equation for the system consisting of space a for macroscopic degrees of freedom and space b , for microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "( 2 ) we introduce the classical trajectory given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the time and @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the coordinate and the conjugate momentum operators of the macroscopic degrees of freedom .
