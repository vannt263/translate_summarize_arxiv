    "the larger numbers of @xmath54 galaxies per acs field compared with the number of @xmath17 galaxies per wfc3 field ( see  [ subsection : uncorrelated_acs_fields ] ) makes the @xmath54 acs experiment much easier .",

    "the number counts within the @xmath14-th field of the @xmath23 pointings within the contiguous survey will then be correlated with the other @xmath120 fields approximately at the level of @xmath121 this typically underestimates the correlation between very nearby or adjacent fields , but should approximate the average correlation of the most widely - spaced pointings within the contiguous area .",
    "the matrix describing the correlation between fields @xmath14 and @xmath120 then has a simple form , with the diagonal elements @xmath122 and off - diagonal elements @xmath123 .",
    "to model the counts in correlated fields , we use a standard cholesky decomposition technique to instill the distribution of galaxy overdensities with the correlation matrix @xmath124 , and then poisson - sample the correlated distribution to generate the counts in each field .",
    "figure [ fig : bias_constraint_correlated ] shows the results of this procedure .",
    "since the number counts in fields are correlated ( @xmath125 for @xmath87 and @xmath126 for @xmath89 ) , the dispersion @xmath85 in the acs galaxy counts becomes smaller than in the uncorrelated case .",
    "the resulting estimates for the cosmic variance are correspondingly smaller , leading to a bias measurement that is underestimated ( @xmath127 for @xmath87 and @xmath128 for @xmath89 ) and is more susceptible to catastrophic ( measured @xmath129 ) failures ( @xmath130 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the simulations presented in  [",
    "subsection : uncorrelated_acs_fields ] and [ subsection : uncorrelated_wfc3_fields ] demonstrate that the bias of high - redshift galaxies can be measured directly from the variance in number counts between uncorrelated fields . using the connection between bias and dm halo mass calculated from cosmological simulations @xcite , the galaxy bias can be used to estimate the characteristic mass of dm halos with similar spatial clustering strength . for detailed discussions of the connection between halo mass and bias , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_constraint ] shows the characteristic halo mass estimated by converting the bias ( figure [ fig : bias_constraint ] ) using the @xcite bias - mass relation determined from cosmological simulations . for the case of @xmath65ab magnitude @xmath14-dropout galaxies at redshift @xmath54 with bias @xmath84 , the mass of halos with the same bias at @xmath54 is @xmath131 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the bias can provide a precise estimate of a characteristic dm halo mass ( @xmath132 in @xmath133 for @xmath87 and @xmath115 in @xmath133 for @xmath89 ) that , while skewed , is accurate ( @xmath134/\\log m = -0.03 $ ] for @xmath87 and @xmath135 for @xmath89 ) .",
    "this measure of a characteristic halo mass only corresponds to the halo mass of @xmath14-dropout galaxies if each halo hosts one galaxy and mass strongly correlates with luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but provides a convenient conceptual tool for discussing the approximate mass scale of high - redshift galaxies .",

    "* ) for measuring the bias of high - redshift galaxies from the field - to - field variation in number counts induced by cosmic variance .",
    "the number of high - redshift galaxies of a given luminosity are measured in a large number independent , widely - separated fields .",
    "the poisson contribution to the variance in the number counts across these fields is removed , leaving a cosmic variance contribution that depends on the bias and the mean matter overdensity fluctuations on the scale of the survey field volume .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations of the bias measurement to estimate the effectiveness of the method for example galaxy populations , @xmath14-dropouts at @xmath54 in acs - sized fields and @xmath136-dropouts at @xmath17 in wfc3-sized fields .",

    "the method should provide a measurement of galaxy bias with @xmath137 for luminosities near @xmath138 when @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) fields are used .",
    "the uncertainty on the galaxy bias improves with an increasing number of independent fields as @xmath141 .",
    "these requirements on the number of fields are concomitant with the expected number of pointings available from extensions to ongoing pure parallel hst programs @xcite , and the potential for using this method to measure high - redshift galaxy bias is therefore promising .",
    "we also show that using correlated , nearby fields to perform the presented measurement typically leads to an underestimate of the bias owing to a correlation - induced decrease in the dispersion of galaxy number counts .",
    "the measured bias can be associated with a characteristic mass of dm halos with similar clustering .",
    "we show that the typical uncertainty in the bias measured using the presented method corresponds to an uncertainty in the inferred dm halo mass of @xmath142 a few percent in @xmath133 for @xmath14-dropouts . combining these estimates of halo mass with",
    "the observed luminosities allow for an estimate of a mass - to - light ratio , which can constrain the connection between the galaxies observed lf and their clustering @xcite .",
    "numerous effects can alter the correspondence between bias and halo mass , and we therefore view the presented method as primarily a measure of bias and interpret the halo mass estimates with caution .",
    "our simulations assume that the high - redshift galaxy population is essentially volume limited and pure .",
    "methods to handle incompleteness for lbg samples have already been engineered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contamination at a fractional level of @xmath143 will lower the bias by an amount @xmath144 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . using simulations that include red @xmath145 galaxy interlopers with @xmath146 and a bias of @xmath147 @xcite , we find that the measured bias at @xmath54 is lowered by @xmath148 .",
    "this systematic error is comparable to the statistical error on the bias when @xmath149 .",
    "lastly , not every parallel field will be useful for measuring high - redshift galaxy counts owing , e.g. , to possible bright star or galactic reddening contamination , and the efficiency of the presented method may be correspondingly decreased .",
