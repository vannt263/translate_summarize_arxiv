    "the unified model for active galaxies @xcite is based on the existence of a dusty toroidal structure surrounding the central region of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . considering this geometry of the obscuring material ,",
    "the central engines of type-1 agn can be seen directly , resulting in typical spectra with both narrow and broad emission lines , whereas in type-2 agn the broad line region ( blr ) is obscured .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) range ( and particularly the mid - infrared ; mir ) is key to characterize the torus , since the dust reprocesses the optical and ultraviolet radiation generated in the accretion process and re - emits it in this range .",
    "however , considering the small torus size , high angular resolution turns to be essential to isolate as much as possible its emission .",
    "pioneering work in modelling the dusty torus @xcite assumed a uniform dust density distribution to simplify the modelling , although from the start , @xcite realized that smooth dust distributions can not survive within the immediate agn vicinity . to solve the various discrepancies between observations and models , an intensive search for an alternative torus geometry",
    "has been carried out in the last decade .",
    "the clumpy torus models @xcite propose that the dust is distributed in clumps , instead of homogeneously filling the torus volume .",
    "these models are making significant progress in accounting for the mir emission of agn @xcite .    in previous works we constructed subarcsecond resolution ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for about 20 nearby seyfert galaxies and successfully reproduced them with the clumpy torus models of nenkova et al .",
    "( hereafter clumpy ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that some observational results show that the clumpy models alone can not explain the ir seds of a sample of pg quasars @xcite .",
    "the latter authors needed an additional hot dust component to reproduce the seds .",
    "moreover , recent interferometry results @xcite indicate that a single component torus does not reproduce the observations .",
    "the clumpy database now contains @xmath15@xmath210@xmath3 models , calculated for a fine grid of model parameters .",
    "the inherent degeneracy between these parameters has to be taken into account when fitting the observables .",
    "to this end , we developed the bayesian inference tool bayesclumpy .",
    "details on the interpolation methods and algorithms employed can be found in @xcite .",
    "we point out that , given the specificities of the bayesian inference approach we follow , in the following analysis we will not be using the original set of models described in @xcite , but an interpolated version of them .",
    "in @xcite we fitted ir seds constructed using mir nuclear fluxes obtained with 8 m telescopes and nir measurements of similar resolution from the literature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some of the seds were well - sampled ( e.g. the circinus galaxy and centaurus a ) whilst others comprised just three photometric data points ( e.g. ngc 1365 and ngc 1386 ) .",
    "the better the sampling of the sed , the more constrained the torus parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) . considering the need for 8 - 10 m telescopes to isolate the torus emission ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the minimum number of filters required to constrain the model parameters .",
    "we utilize the output of our code bayesclumpy  in a bayesian experiment design framework .",
    "our aim is to design the experiment ( observation of a source using a selected filter ) that introduces more constraints for the parameters of the clumpy models . using our bayesian approach",
    ", we can investigate which and how many optical , ir , and sub - mm filters restrict the most the parameter space , as well as which wavelengths provide more information about each of the parameters .",
    "although here we present results for the models of nenkova et al . , the formalism can be applied to any other set of models , including multi - component ones .",
    "thus , this work can be useful for the community when applying for telescope observations .",
    "the clumpy models of @xcite hold that the dust surrounding the central engine of an agn is distributed in clumps .",
    "these clumps are distributed with a radial extent @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the outer and inner radius of the toroidal distribution , respectively ( see figure [ clumpy_scheme ] ) .",
    "the inner radius is defined by the dust sublimation temperature ( @xmath7 k ) , with @xmath8 pc . within this geometry , each clump has the same optical depth ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "all the clouds are supposed to have the same @xmath9 , and @xmath12 characterizes the width of the angular distribution .",
    "the number of cloud encounters is function of the viewing angle , @xmath13.,width=302 ]    in every bayesian scheme , one needs to specify a - priori information about the model parameters .",
    "this is done through the prior distribution ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we consider them to be truncated uniform distributions for the six model parameters in the intervals reported in table [ tab : parametros ] .",
    "therefore , we give the same weight to all the values in each interval . to compare with the observations ,",

    "however , this is not usually the case since the noise variance at different wavelengths can vary a lot . assuming that the observation @xmath29 is perturbed with gaussian noise with variance @xmath30 , the likelihood @xmath31 is a gaussian distribution , so its entropy is analytically expressed as : @xmath32 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\log \\left ( 2\\pi \\mathrm{e } \\sigma_f^2 \\right).\\ ] ] given that the previous entropy is independent of @xmath16 , it can be extracted from the integral in eq .",

    "the bayesian adaptive exploration theory , as summarized in the previous section , is applied to the case of seds generated by the emission of a clumpy torus around an agn . under the assumption that the parametric models of @xcite are representative of the underlying physics , our analysis allows us to search for the filter that introduces more restrictions on the model parameters .    our set of potential filters",
    "is listed in table [ tab : filters ] .",
    "our aim is to consider a sufficiently complete list of photometric filters available in many medium- to large - aperture telescopes .",

    "forcast is a mir / fir camera for the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ; @xcite ) . finally , to inspect whether or not sub - mm data can set any constraints on the model parameters , we have also added channels 7 and 9 of alma , although they can not be considered filters per se .",

    "the transmission efficiency of the filters have been obtained from the literature .",
    "it is important to note that , for the sake of simplicity , in this work we are not taking into account the angular resolution provided by the different instruments considered here . in other words",
    ", we are assuming that all instruments listed in table [ tab : filters ] are equivalent except in the wavelength coverage .",
    "however , the reader must keep in mind that high spatial resolution is mandatory when trying to isolate the torus emission .",
    "thus , aside from the expected utilities derived here for the different instruments , it is important to consider the resolution when deciding which should be the next observation .",
    "black dots correspond to filters with @xmath46 @xmath0 m , red dots to @xmath47 @xmath0 m , blue dots to @xmath48 @xmath0 m and green dots to @xmath49 @xmath0 m .

    "these seds have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite using a deep bayesian analysis .",
    "additionally , here we use the sy1 and sy2 average templates presented in @xcite .",
    "these mean templates were constructed using individual sy1 and sy2 seds of angular resolution @xmath500.55 arcsec , that were first interpolated onto the circinus wavelength grid ( 1.265 , 1.60 , 2.18 , 3.80 , 4.80 , 8.74 , and 18.3 @xmath0 m ) , and then normalized to the central wavelength of the t - recs si2 filter ( 8.74 @xmath0 m ) . these flux densities and their associated errors",

    "this analysis relies on sampling the posterior distribution function as a function of the model parameters ( shown in table [ tab : parametros ] ) .",
    "we have used flat priors for all model parameters . for the sy1 galaxies",
    ", we have additionally included an agn spectrum , which is added to the clumpy sed .",
    "the shape of the agn spectrum is the same that is considered for the infrared pumping of the dust in the torus @xcite .",
    "likewise , we also take into account a certain amount of extinction following the law of @xcite .",
    "this introduces the free parameter @xmath51 , which is included into the inference for sy1 galaxies with a flat prior in the range @xmath52 $ ] mag .",
    "the inclusion of these two ingredients turns out to be essential for obtaining reliable results for sy1 sources .",
    "bayesclumpy   generates samples of model parameters distributed according to the posterior distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows , apart from the observed points , a representation of the seds reconstructed from the model parameters sampled from the posterior .",
    "note that the sampled seds have a small variability close to the observed points with the smaller error bars . in principle , and according to the maximum entropy sampling derived by @xcite and @xcite , the filter that we should select has to be located close to the wavelength where the seds contain larger variability with the observational information we have acquired .",
    "an evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu_final ] ) , following the ideas of sec .",
    "[ sec : technical ] , gives the results displayed in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : expected_utility ] .",
    "this figure represents the value of @xmath53 for filter @xmath21 versus the central wavelength of the filter .",
    "the noise associated to any new observation , @xmath30 , depends on the wavelength : we consider 10% of the value of the flux at @xmath54 , 20% at @xmath55 and 30% at @xmath56 .",
    "these are the typical uncertainties that we measured for individual galaxies in our previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expected utility is usually measured in terms of `` nats '' ( or bits ) , i.e. , units of information . however , since we are not interested in their actual value but in relative measures , we normalize the plots to the maximum .",
    "several properties are evident .",
    "first , the lack of a vertical spread on the plots for a given wavelength means that the expected utility of the filters depends essentially on the wavelength . using different filters with the same central wavelength but different transmission properties",
    "produce the same increase in the information acquired .",
    "in other words , the results are not dependent on the exact shape of the filter transmission curve .",
    "obviously , other reasons ( atmospheric transmission , telescope diameter , availability , etc . )",
    "would make one particular filter preferable among a set of equivalent filters .",
    "however , under the same conditions , they introduce roughly the same information for constraining clumpy models .    in general ,",
    "the region between 10 and 200 @xmath0 m produces the largest increase in the expected utility . out of the filters considered here , those from sofia provide the largest constraining power for the clumpy models .",
    "however , the poor spatial resolution of sofia ( @xmath134 arcsec ) represents a clear drawback and it might be preferable to choose other filters with slightly smaller expected utility but better spatial resolution .",
    "the filters in the q - band , especially the canaricam q8 filter ( @xmath5724.5 @xmath0 m ) , are the next most useful ones for constraining the clumpy torus model parameters , specially if we consider their good spatial resolution ( @xmath10.55 arcsec ) .",
    "they are closely followed by filters in the n - band ( @xmath18 - 12 @xmath0 m ) and by the herschel space observatory pacs filters , especially pacs70 and pacs100 .",
    "the previous results are not surprising considering that the bulk of torus emission is observed in the mir , peaking at @xmath120 @xmath0 m",
    ". the pacs observations , which cover the spectral range from 70 to 160 @xmath0 m , are sampling cooler dust within the torus , and thus helping to constrain parameters such as the torus radial extent ( @xmath58 ) and the radial distribution of the clouds ( @xmath59 ) , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "according to our results , data points obtained with the spire instrument on herschel despite its low spatial resolution , which we are neglecting here still have a relatively large expected utility , and the same happens with sub - mm data from alma .",
    "we have considered two alma channels ( 7 and 9 ) and the expected utility of channel 9 ( @xmath60 @xmath0 m ) is comparable to that provided by the nir data in the case of the sy2 galaxies .",
    "this result is encouraging for potential alma users looking for constraints on torus properties .",
    "alma will observe in the sub - mm regime with unprecedented angular resolution , and according to the analysis presented here , data obtained with channel 9 can provide useful constraints on torus model parameters .",
    "the case of herschel spire and alma clearly illustrates what we discussed at the beginning of this section : although the expected utilities measured for the spire filters are slightly higher than those for alma channel 9 , the angular resolution provided by alma makes it a better choice than spire to sample the cool dust within the torus . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected utility of channel 7 ( @xmath61 @xmath0 m ) is negligible in all the cases considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no apparent difference between sy1 and sy2 galaxies regarding the proposed new filters at wavelengths @xmath624 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , it seems that spectral features that are supposed to serve to constrain the model parameters because they are generally different in sy1 and sy2 ( such as the silicate feature at 10 @xmath0 m , generally in emission in sy1 and in absorption in sy2 ) do not make any difference in suggesting new observations .",
    "it is worth noting , though , that here we are using photometry only , which can provide just an insight of spectral features such as the silicate band .",
    "the use of high angular resolution spectroscopy in this spectral region ( provided by ground - based instruments such as visir , michelle and canaricam ) can set constraints on the clumpy torus models that the photometry alone can not @xcite .",
    "thus , the use of spectroscopy would possibly change the suggested observations .",
    "unfortunately , the expression for the expected utility of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu_final ] ) in the spectroscopic case requires the computation of a multidimensional integral because the expected observation @xmath29 transforms into the vector @xmath63 .",
    "tailor - made algorithms which are computationally heavy have to be applied to compute this integral . for this reason",
    ", we defer the spectroscopic case to a later study .        at wavelengths",
    "@xmath504 @xmath0 m we start to see a difference between the expected utilities of sy1 and sy2 .",
    "optical and nir observations help constraining the torus parameters for sy1 ( expected utilities between 0.4 and 0.8 ) more than for sy2 ( expected utilities @xmath10.2 around 1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the hot dust emission from the directly illuminated faces of the clumps close to the central engine and the direct agn emission strongly flatten the sy1 ir seds ( see figure [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "thus , in the case of sy1 , more observations at short wavelengths are required to constrain the shape of the sed in this region , that in turn constrains parameters such as the inclination angle of the torus ( @xmath13 ) .    as an experiment , we have simulated which is the influence of having a reduced set of observations . to this aim",
    ", we have considered the observed points below and above 4 @xmath0 m from the complete seds .",
    "this separation was chosen to roughly separate the nir and the mir keeping a similar number of points in both spectral domains .",
    "the resulting seds are shown in the left and right six panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : seds_above_below ] respectively , using the same normalization as in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] .",
    "again , the grey curves are samples of seds using the model parameters from the bayesian inference . despite the sparser sampling of the seds in the two cases , the results remain essentially similar ( see central and right panels of fig [ fig : expected_utility ] ) , with the expected utility peaking in the 10 - 200 @xmath0 m region .",
    "the only difference in the results is a small increase in the expected utitility of the optical and nir data when only @xmath644 @xmath65 data is considered in the sy2 seds ( bottom right panels in figure [ fig : expected_utility ] ) .",
    "the process we have described until this point is obviously not complete . as already described in sec . [",
    "sec : bae ] , the bayesian adaptive exploration scheme starts from observations , and then applies bayesian inference tools to design a new potentially informative observation .",
    "since the typical timescale of this process can be very large given the necessity to apply for observing time in large - aperture telescopes , we have carried out a simulated full process in fig . [",
    "fig : experiment ] . we have used the sed of the sy2 galaxy ngc 3081 presented in @xcite .",
    "the reason for choosing this galaxy is the availability of herschel pacs nuclear fluxes . as a first step",
    ", we have assumed that we only have the observation in the nicmos f160w filter and let the bayesian adaptive exploration scheme select the following filters .",
    "bayesclumpy   then uses this point to sample the posterior distribution and obtain marginal posteriors for the clumpy model parameters .",
    "the observed point , together with the seds sampled from the posterior are shown in the first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] .",
    "the second column shows the expected utility , while the remaining panels display the marginal posterior for @xmath12 , @xmath58 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 , respectively .    in order to simulate the next experiment ,",
    "we have selected the next observation from the set of observed points of the full sed that has the largest expected utility , which turns out to be the t - recs qa data point ( @xmath66 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the full process is then repeated until having all the observed points of the sed in the lowest panel .",
    "the order in which the remaining filters have been selected is : pacs70 , pacs100 , pacs160 , visir neii@xmath672 ( @xmath68 @xmath0 m ) and finally , t - recs si2 ( @xmath69 @xmath0 m ) . given that the differences in expected utility are quite small and can change a little because of the inherently random character of the montecarlo sampling done with bayesclumpy the specific order might change from run to run .",
    "in fact , this means that one could choose a filter giving a large expected utility even though it is not the one giving the largest value if observing with this filter is easier for some specific reason .",
    "it is important to note how the marginal posteriors are constrained when augmenting the number of observed points .",
    "once there are two points in the nir and mir , the marginal posterior of @xmath12 is very similar to what we find when considering the full sed .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath58 and @xmath10 , that considerably change after introducing the fir data and the n - band data points ( neii@xmath702 and si2 filters ) .",
    "finally , the fir does not seem to make any difference to the inclination angle of the torus , @xmath13 , but the addition of the n - band data points especially the si2 filter result in a different posterior shape , favouring intermediate torus inclinations .",
    "the clumpy models have recently gained much success on explaining the observed ir sed of the inner parsecs of nearby seyfert galaxies . given the observational difficulty ( one needs to obtain good signal - to - noise ir photometry of sources at subarcsecond resolution , and ideally , spectroscopy ) ,",
    "the sampling of the seds is generally quite scarce . assuming that the clumpy models are successful in explaining the observed sed , we have applied a bayesian adaptive exploration scheme to propose new observations given the presently available information about a source .",
    "the results quantitatively indicate that the region between 10 and 200 @xmath0 m is crucial , almost independently of the presently available observed points .",
    "we also find that optical and nir data have higher expected utilities in the case of sy1 than in sy2 .",
    "finally , data from 200 to 500 @xmath0 m are found to be useful , even if not as much as data in the 10 - 200 @xmath0 m range , for constraining the torus model parameters .",
    "it is important to note that , for simplicity , here we are not considering the angular resolution provided by the different instruments .",
    "thus , aside from the measured expected utility of a given filter , it is important to consider the resolution of the data when deciding the next observation .",
    "we performed a bae experiment for the galaxy ngc 3081 and found that having two data points only one in the nir and another in the mir significantly constrains the the torus width ( @xmath12 ) , which does not change when adding further ir data points .",
    "the addition of fir data helps constraining the torus radial extent ( @xmath58 ) and the number of clouds ( n@xmath71 ) .",
    "finally , the combination of the j , si2 and q filters appears to be the most suitable to constrain the inclination angle of the torus ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "note , however , that these are the results found for a particular galaxy , and they may not be applicable to all seyferts .    given the large pressure on large - aperture telescopes , our approach when combined with spatial resolution considerations is very promising for constraining clumpy models , and possibly torus models in general , in sparsely sampled seds with the smallest number of observed points .",
    "the bayesian adaptive exploration scheme can be applied to any parametric model ( e.g. , smooth torus , light curves of classical eclipsing binaries , x - ray binaries ) once the tools to carry out a fully bayesian inference are available .",
    "the application to the clumpy models is straightforward thanks to the bayesclumpy  tool .",
    "we note that the computation of the expected utility is already included in the public version of bayesclumpy , which is available for the community .",

    "<S> recent success in explaining several properties of the dusty torus around the central engine of active galactic nuclei has been gathered with the assumption of clumpiness . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of such clumpy dusty tori can be inferred by analyzing spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , sometimes with scarce sampling given that large aperture telescopes and long integration times are needed to get good spatial resolution and signal . </S>",
    "<S> we aim at using the information already present in the data and the assumption of clumpy dusty torus , in particular , the clumpy models of nenkova et al . </S>",
    "<S> , to evaluate the optimum next observation such that we maximize the constraining power of the new observed photometric point . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we use the existing and barely applied idea of bayesian adaptive exploration , a mixture of bayesian inference , prediction and decision theories . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that the new photometric filter to use is the one that maximizes the expected utility , which we approximate with the entropy of the predictive distribution . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we have to sample where there is larger variability in the seds compatible with the data with what we know of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that bayesian adaptive exploration can be used to suggest new observations , and ultimately optimal filter sets , to better constrain the parameters of the clumpy dusty torus models . in general , we find that the region between 10 and 200 @xmath0 m produces the largest increase in the expected utility , although sub - mm data from alma also prove to be useful . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that here we are not considering the angular resolution of the data , which is key when constraining torus parameters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expected utilities derived from this methodology must be weighted with the spatial resolution of the data .    [ firstpage ]    methods : data analysis , statistical  galaxies : active , nuclei , seyfert </S>"
