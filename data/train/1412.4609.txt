    "one - dimensional classical fluids have anomalous transport properties , as has been recognized already in the early 1970ies @xcite . but",
    "intense theoretical investigations , very much supported by molecular dynamics ( md ) , started in the late 1990ies @xcite . to study energy transport",
    ", a popular setup is to impose thermal boundary conditions .",
    "if the boundary temperatures differ , a steady state energy flux is enforced .",
    "fourier s law states that the energy flux is proportional to @xmath2 with @xmath3 the system size .",
    "the anomaly consist in having a larger energy flux , namely @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "a related property is the time - dependent response in the local energy to a small perturbation close to the origin of the equilibrated system , which can be expressed through the energy - energy time - correlation in equilibrium . denoting the microscopic fluctuating energy density by @xmath6 , the said correlation is @xmath7 , where the average is over the",
    "canonical equilibrium state and stationarity in @xmath8 has been used .",
    "@xmath9 has a central heat peak together with left and right sound peaks propagating with the speed of sound , @xmath10 .",
    "fourier s law means a diffusive , @xmath0 , spreading of the heat peak , while the anomaly corresponds to a super - diffusive spreading . for large times",
    "the heat peak is expected to maintain the scaling form @xmath11 with some scaling exponent @xmath12 and a non - gaussian scaling function @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a model - dependent scale coefficient .",
    "the structure of time - correlations for the conserved fields has been discussed in @xcite with md support in @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on current fluctuations , a topic which has hardly been touched upon in the mentioned investigations .",
    "the local energy satisfies the conservation law @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the microscopic fluctuating energy current . using stationarity in @xmath17 and in @xmath18 ,",
    "one concludes that @xmath19 thus , in essence , the local energy correlation carries the same information as the local current correlation .",
    "however in the green - kubo formula the total fluctuating current , @xmath20 is employed , more precisely its correlation @xmath21 . now",
    "the connection to @xmath9 is less direct and a separate investigation is required .",
    "one - dimensional fluids have three conservation laws and , in principle , one should study the entire @xmath22 correlator of total currents .",
    "generally it is assumed that , even for anomalous transport , the steady state energy flux enforced through thermal boundary conditions is still related to the total equilibrium energy current correlation as @xmath23 thus along with a direct md measurement of the energy flux , mostly also the energy current correlation in thermal equilibrium is simulated .",
    "the contributions are numerous , too many to be listed here , and we refer to the reviews @xcite .",
    "generically one tries to estimate the long - time decay of the correlation , respectively the small frequency behavior of its fourier transform .",
    "however the full @xmath24 correlation matrix has never been studied , with the notable exception @xcite who discuss also the total momentum current correlation . in our contribution",
    "we discuss the full correlation matrix and compare the predictions based on fluctuating hydrodynamics with md simulation of the three hard collision models from @xcite .",
    "the green - kubo type formula uses only the variance of @xmath25 . since @xmath26 is a fluctuating quantity ,",
    "also its distribution is of physical interest .",
    "an example would be the distribution of the time - integrated current , @xmath27 at some given spatial location @xmath17 . for transport in electronic systems such current statistics are of great physical interest @xcite . for stochastic dynamics with a single conservation law similar quantities",
    "have been studied in considerable detail .",
    "results on typical fluctuations @xcite and large deviations @xcite are available . for mechanical systems , to our knowledge the only study concerns higher - order cumulants for a fluid with hard core particles and alternating masses @xcite .",
    "our novel ansatz is to consider the time - integrated current along the straight line @xmath28 .",
    "generically such a current has gaussian statistics on the scale @xmath0 .",
    "but if the endpoint is located at one of the peaks , i.e. , @xmath29 with @xmath10 the speed of sound , and if one chooses the current corresponding to the respective peak , then the size of the fluctuations will be much smaller and the distribution becomes non - gaussian .    to provide on outline , basic material",
    "is collected in sect .",
    "the predictions based on mode - coupling and on the second moment sum rule are explained in sect .",
    "they are compared with md simulations of the hard collision models studied already in @xcite , see sect .",
    "we study the full current statistics in sects .",
    "[ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] .",
    "in particular , we explain the baik - rains distribution and provide numerical evidence for such a behavior .",
    "most of the material in this section can be found in earlier literature .",
    "but we could not find an exposition which , from our perspective , is sufficiently concise . at the risk of repetition , we list items for later use .",
    "we consider an anharmonic chain with interaction potential @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath30 is bounded from below and satisfies the one - sided bound @xmath31 for either @xmath32 or @xmath33 with some @xmath34 .",
    "then , at fixed inverse temperature @xmath35 , there is a non - empty interval @xmath36 such that the one - particle partition function @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the dynamics of the chain is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the momentum and @xmath41 the position of the @xmath42-th particle .",
    "we consider the case where all particles have the same mass @xmath43 .",
    "the extension to alternating masses , i.e. , to a unit cell containing two particles , will be discussed below . in principle , the difference @xmath44 could be bounded , or half - bounded , which would be encoded by letting @xmath45 as @xmath17 approaches a boundary point of such an interval .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the stretch @xmath46 .",
    "then the equations of motion read @xmath47 the local energy is defined by @xmath48 and satisfies @xmath49 thus there are three local conservation laws and we require that there exist no further ones .",
    "unfortunately this condition is extremely difficult to check .",
    "however it does rule out integrable chains as the nearest neighbor toda and harmonic chain .",
    "in essence there are two different definitions for what one means by an instantaneous local current .",
    "the first , seemingly more physical , prescription is based on interpreting @xmath41 as the position of a particle in the physical space @xmath50 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then @xmath51 is the current of the conserved field at location @xmath52 $ ] at time @xmath18 .",
    "it has two contributions , one is merely the flow of the conserved quantity across @xmath17 , while the second one is slightly nonlocal and involves the force acting between two particles close to @xmath17 .",
    "for example the energy density reads @xmath53 the energy current is then determined through and is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 if the condition in the argument is satisfied and @xmath56 otherwise .",
    "this is the eulerian point of view . for a true one - dimensional fluid of unlabeled particles , the potential being the sum over all pairs @xmath57 ,",
    "there is no choice and the analogue of , is the appropriate definition . for anharmonic chains",
    "the particles are labeled and one can take also the lagrangian point of view , in which @xmath58 is regarded as the  field \" at lattice site @xmath42 .",
    "the currents then follow from the equations of motion , in the sense that the time change of a conserved field , when summed over the lattice interval @xmath59 $ ] , is only through the currents at the two boundary points . in our example",
    "the energy current follows from eq .   and is given by @xmath60 there is no contribution from free streaming .",
    "currents flow only if there is a force acting . as in @xcite",
    ", we will adopt here the lattice field theory point of view .    on a macroscopic level one",
    "expects the lagrangian and eulerian points of view to agree up to the obvious scale changes .",
    "for example , the asymptotic decay of a total current correlation should be the same in either definition .",
    "but the finite time corrections may differ .",
    "also in md simulations there will be finite size corrections which generically depend on the definition employed .",
    "we consider the finite ring @xmath61 = \\lambda _ n$ ] and impose periodic boundary conditions as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , which is also the labeling used in the numerical part .",
    "for the infinite volume limit the centered ring @xmath64 $ ] is more convenient .",
    "initially the system is in canonical equilibrium . in md simulations ,",
    "the microcanonical measure is more natural and thus frequently used . we will discuss their relation below .",
    "for canonical equilibrium the intensive variables are the pressure , @xmath65 , and the inverse temperature , @xmath66 .",
    "this state has the probability density @xmath67 \\prod_{j=0}^{n-1 } dr_j\\ , dp_j\\,.\\ ] ]    the collection @xmath68 are thus independent random variables with identical distribution .",
    "of course , this carries over to the infinite volume limit .",
    "the condition ensures that for @xmath69 the partition function is finite .",
    "we have to introduce some notation for the averages .",
    "a simple @xmath70 means equilibrium average with the precise conditions specified through the context .",
    "to be more specific we use the subscripts @xmath71 and also indicate the finite volume @xmath72 . omitting @xmath72 refers to infinite volume @xmath73 .",
    "thus @xmath74 means the infinite volume canonical equilibrium average . to be systematic , one should also shift the @xmath40 s to the mean @xmath75 , which however can be accounted for by a galilean transformation .    from and",
    "one reads off the @xmath76-vector of conserved fields as @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and the respective local currents as @xmath80 @xmath78 , @xmath81 .",
    "currents and fields are related through the conservation law @xmath82 out of the vector in one forms the correlator of the conserved fields @xmath83 using already stationarity in @xmath84 , and correspondingly out of the vector in the current - current correlator @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the label for the components and @xmath87 denotes the second cumulant .",
    "these correlators have symmetries .",
    "they result from stationarity and invariance under time reversal together with the fact that the fields 1,3 are even and the field 2 is odd , while current 2 is even and currents 1,3 are odd under the momentum reversal @xmath88 for all @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 , @xmath90 it will be convenient to regard @xmath91 and @xmath92 as @xmath93 matrices .",
    "the total currents are defined by @xmath94 and the total current covariance reads @xmath95 @xmath96 is itself conserved , hence @xmath97 is independent of @xmath18 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the only total currents of interest are thus @xmath100 with @xmath101 . from the symmetries in it",
    "follows that @xmath102 and also @xmath103 .    in our contribution",
    "we first take the limit @xmath104 and then study the long time decay of the correlations .",
    "the reversed point of view is considered in @xcite .",
    "the two limits can not be interchanged . for fixed @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    "the sound modes collide . in @xcite",
    ", the dynamics is followed through 17 complete returns of the sound peaks to the origin . in this particular md simulation",
    "the peaks seem to pass through each other with little interaction .",
    "another option is to put both boundary points in contact with a langevin type reservoir at the _ same _ temperature @xcite .",
    "then the canonical measure , possibly with some boundary potentials , is the unique steady state .",
    "the sound mode is absorbed and partially reflected at the boundaries .",
    "this leads to an exponential damping of @xmath107 as @xmath108 with @xmath109 of the order @xmath110 , @xmath10 the sound velocity , which masks the power law decay of the total current correlations .",
    "we now consider the centered interval @xmath111 and study the limit @xmath112 in . up to an exponentially small error @xmath113",
    "should depend only on the variables in the cone @xmath114 with some constant @xmath115 .",
    "thus the current correlation on the right of has an exponential decay uniform in @xmath105 .",
    "each term in the sum converges to its infinite volume limit .",
    "hence by dominated convergence one concludes that @xmath116    _ comment_. to our knowledge quasi - locality has been established only for anharmonic chains with a harmonic on - site potential @xcite . in our context",
    "it would be interesting to establish a similar result for interactions which depend only on positional differences .    _",
    "( i ) sum rules_. let @xmath117 be a test function and @xmath118 with periodic boundary conditions relative to @xmath72 .",
    "the time - integrated version of the conservation law then reads @xmath119 with @xmath120 denoting the transpose , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "we multiply on both sides with the same identity but now for component @xmath122 and test function @xmath123 . taking the equilibrium average and the limit @xmath124 results in @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the discrete laplacian . at first",
    "the identity holds only for @xmath127 s with integrable decay . since , for fixed @xmath18 , the current correlations and @xmath128 decay exponentially fast , one can extend to @xmath127 s with polynomial increase .    for @xmath129",
    "one arrives at @xmath130 the second moment sum rule is obtained for @xmath131 . then @xmath132 using that @xmath133 for @xmath134 . with the choice @xmath135",
    "one has @xmath136 and the current - current correlation can be obtained through @xmath137    as discussed in @xcite , there is also a first moment sum rule , for which eq .",
    "is multiplied on both sides by @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 is the @xmath93 matrix of linearized currents .    for the ring",
    "@xmath142 the identity holds provided the sum is over @xmath111 and @xmath143 is replaced by @xmath144 . however the choice @xmath131 results in @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 . to obtain the total current in approximation one has to choose @xmath131 at points where the correlation is significant and use a maximally smooth interpolation otherwise",
    "however eq .   with @xmath149 has a useful finite volume version , which reads @xmath150    _ ( ii ) limit @xmath106_. @xmath151 is easily computed .",
    "but one can also determine the long - time limit , for which the left hand side of is dominated by the sound peaks at @xmath152 .",
    "the asymptotic contribution is @xmath153 times the area under the peak .",
    "this is the landau - placzek ratio .",
    "using the notation from @xcite and @xmath154 , the ratio is time - independent and given by @xmath155 by antisymmetry in @xmath18 the off - diagonal terms in the second moment sum rule are identical zero .",
    "hence only the long - time limit of the diagonal matrix elements can be obtained as @xmath156 of course , the constant @xmath157 matrix element is also properly reproduced .    as an independent check , and also to fill in the off - diagonal terms , we apply the _ hydrodynamic projection method _ , which is based on postulating that the zero modes in the space of fluctuation fields are given by the conserved fields .",
    "we work directly in infinite volume .",
    "fluctuation observables are of the form @xmath158 here @xmath159 is a local observable on phase space , in the sense that it depends only on @xmath160 with @xmath161 , @xmath162 the range of @xmath159 .",
    "we denote by @xmath163 the function @xmath159 shifted by @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "thus @xmath165 .",
    "also @xmath166 is assumed throughout .",
    "to give an example , for @xmath167 the function shifted by @xmath42 is @xmath168 .",
    "the asymptotic covariance , @xmath169 defines a hilbert space with scalar product @xmath170 .",
    "note that any difference function , @xmath171 , is a null vector in this hilbert space .",
    "if one starts from a local observable @xmath159 , then for any @xmath172 , it will depend on all @xmath173 .",
    "however the dependence on far away arguments is exponentially small in the distance from the origin .",
    "such functions are called quasilocal .",
    "the sum in has an exponential bound and the definition of @xmath170 extends to such quasilocal functions .",
    "next note that @xmath174 , since @xmath175 is conserved .",
    "the assumption that there are no further conservation laws translate more formally into the property that the time - invariant subspace is already exhausted by the local functions @xmath176 .",
    "thus , for the long - time limit , one has to compute the projection of the currents onto the conserved fields in our hilbert space .    for this purpose",
    "we define @xmath177 the hydrodynamic projection of the currents onto the conserved fields is then @xmath178 and thus @xmath179 as @xmath93 matrix .",
    "@xmath180 is the normalization of the projection onto the conserved fields . for @xmath181 one",
    "obtains after a few partial integrations @xmath182 @xmath183 and its inverse are is easily computed . in working out the right hand side of",
    ", one uses that @xmath184 .",
    "thus we obtain agreement with the result from and also identified the off - diagonal limits . for later convenience",
    "we define @xmath186 such that @xmath187 .",
    "it is common practice to take care of the constant term by a redefinition of the microscopic total currents @xcite .",
    "this can be done also here with the result @xmath188 the variance of @xmath189 tends to @xmath190 as @xmath106 .    _",
    "( iii ) equivalence of ensembles_. in the microcanonical ensemble the total conserved fields have a fixed value proportional to @xmath191 , which results in the probability distribution @xmath192 in principle one should also constrain the momentum to @xmath193 , which however can be shifted to @xmath194 by a galilean transformation . microcanonial averages",
    "carry the superscript `` mic '' .",
    "if @xmath195 is a local function , the equivalence of ensembles tells us that @xmath196 provided the parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 are linked through the rules of thermodynamics .",
    "such equivalence no longer holds for nonlocal observables , such as the fluctuation observable .",
    "but the required modifications follow a simple rule .",
    "let us start from the finite volume correlation function @xmath199 with subtraction of averages understood .",
    "then the microcanonical constraint is reflected by a uniform shift of order @xmath200 as @xmath201 with a yet to be determined constant @xmath202 .",
    "hence @xmath203 the coefficient @xmath202 can be obtained from relations between microcanonical and canonical thermodynamic potentials . in our case",
    "the microcanonical ensemble has three constraints and @xmath204    taking the microcanonical average in defines the total current correlation @xmath205 @xmath206 . for fixed @xmath18",
    "the currents are quasilocal functions and can still be used .",
    "since @xmath207 is conserved , the correction term is independent of @xmath18 and @xmath208 for all @xmath18 .",
    "if the finite system is mixing on the hypersurface defined by constant @xmath209 , then @xmath210 in principle there could be a delicate interchange between large @xmath105 and @xmath18 .",
    "but eq .   tells us that the decay to zero is preserved as @xmath124 .    _",
    "remark_. the long - time asymptotics of @xmath107 depends on the ensemble used .",
    "early 2000 there have been some discussions on the physical relevance of such asymptotics @xcite .",
    "we merely add that , in the context of classical fluids , it is well understood that transport coefficients are related to the broadening of the peaks @xcite .",
    "one dimension makes no exception , only that the broadening can be superdiffusive .",
    "the green - kubo formula attempts to capture the peak broadening .",
    "@xmath211 signals that there is a remnant of the ballistic motion of the sound peaks .",
    "hence @xmath212 has to be subtracted as comes out naturally in eq .  .",
    "the more microscopic option is to modify the currents as explained in .",
    "after dealing with generalities , we arrive at the real task , namely the study of the decay of the correlations @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "currently only two methods seem to be available .",
    "the first one uses the second moment sum rule together with a highly educated , and numerically well confirmed , guess on the structure of @xmath91 , where we refer to @xcite .",
    "the alternative route is to use the mode - coupling approximation from @xcite , for which the current correlation equals the memory kernel .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix element can be handled only through mode - coupling , since by antisymmetry in @xmath42 , respectively @xmath18 , both sides of the second moment sum rule vanish .    _",
    "second moment sum rule_. for the diagonal matrix elements we have @xmath216 using the notation from @xcite , after normal mode transformation one obtains the diagonal form @xmath217 valid approximately for large @xmath84 .",
    "the entries are of self - similar form @xmath218 @xmath219 .",
    "the scaling form is based on the assumption that the modes decouple for large @xmath18 .",
    "then the sound mode is governed by the one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang equation , for which the steady covariance is known exactly @xcite .",
    "the scaling form results from the mode - coupling approximation which yields the symmetric lvy stable distribution with exponent @xmath220 , defined through its fourier transform @xmath221 $ ] .",
    "@xmath222 has a slow power law decay .",
    "however , as well confirmed by md simulations , the scaling function is cut off beyond the sound cone @xmath152 , which is taken into account by the indicator function , @xmath223 , in front of @xmath222 .",
    "one has to compute the second moment and differentiate twice in @xmath18 with the result @xmath224 where we used that @xmath225 is even and normalized to @xmath226 . using @xmath227 for large @xmath228",
    ", one concludes that the second moment is dominated by the tails .",
    "hence @xmath229 next we use @xmath230 and the identity to revert the transformation in . the subtraction terms balance exactly and , in this approximation , @xmath231",
    "the true @xmath232 does not depend on time .",
    "thus there is a discrepancy of order @xmath233 . for momentum and energy current correlations one obtains the asymptotics @xmath234 both total current correlations",
    "are predicted to decay as @xmath233 .",
    "the second moments are sensitive to small changes in the scaling function .",
    "for example in a small asymmetry of the scaling function would induce a correction of order @xmath235(first moment ) .",
    "also in the second moment of @xmath222 diverges which makes the power law sensitive to the cut - off . for these reasons we regard  as a sort of consistency check for the mode - coupling theory .    _",
    "mode - coupling theory_. in @xcite hs proposed mode - coupling equations .",
    "their memory kernel is proportional to the current - current correlations with the asymptotic value already subtracted . in the following we will freely use the notation from @xcite . referring to eq .",

    "in fact , coincides with the mode - coupling formula ( 14a ) of ernst , hauge , and van leeuwen @xcite when translated to the present context . using the definition @xmath238 for the @xmath239 couplings ( eq .  ( 3.22 ) of @xcite )",

    "that , for @xmath242 , the product @xmath243 has vanishing overlap for large @xmath18 , one arrives at @xmath244 note that now only the square of the scaling function appears in the integrals , which is more robust than the second moment .",
    "the integrals are easily obtained , @xmath245 in principle one should retain the cutoff at @xmath246 for @xmath247 , but now this contribution is subdominant . therefore @xmath248 as an interesting qualitative prediction , @xmath249 which should be interpreted as being much smaller than the diagonal terms .",
    "in fact , the md simulations shown below confirm such prediction .",
    "@xmath250 in accordance with the sum rule argument . on the other hand for @xmath213 one obtains the two distinct power laws , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "our md simulations seem to favor the results from mode - coupling .",
    "note that if @xmath253 , then @xmath254 to leading order",
    ".    from the figures displayed below , on might conjecture that the current correlations are decreasing in time .",
    "a simple consistency check is to consider @xmath255 . for @xmath256",
