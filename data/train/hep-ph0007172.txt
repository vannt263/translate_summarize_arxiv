    "much progress has been made in the last years in measuring the hadronic final state in @xmath1-scattering at hera with high precision ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the theoretical tools which are at hand to describe the hadronic final state are basically fixed order perturbative calculations , which for most processes are available at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , or a combination of leading order ( lo ) matrix elements with parton showers ( ps ) , mostly at leading logarithmic accuracy , which are implemented in event generators ( see @xcite for an overview of available monte carlo programs for both approaches ) .",
    "however , it appears that the theoretical calculations are a considerable source of errors in determining physical parameters . as an example , the statistical errors in a recent determination of @xmath2 from dijet production @xcite are at the one - percent level .",
    "the systematical and theoretical errors , on the other hand , are considerably larger and both lie around five percent . therefore , an improvement of the theoretical tools is needed .",
    "the fixed higher order and the ps approaches have complimentary strengths .",
    "the fixed higher order calculations reduce uncertainties due to unphysical renormalization and factorization scale dependences .",
    "wide - angle emission of partons , where interference effects between a large number of diagrams may be important , is described well .",
    "the ps on the other hand allows a description of the cross section in regions where @xmath2 becomes large , especially in the region of collinear particle emission , by means of a resummation of large logarithmic terms .",
    "this allows to e.g.  describe reasonably well the substructure of jets .",
    "in addition , the ps can be terminated at some small scale @xmath3 , which allows to attach some kind of hadronization model , as , e.g. , the lund model @xcite , to describe the non - perturbative region .",
    "it is desirable to find a way of combining the advantages of both approaches into a nlo event generator . in a complete nlo event generator one",
    "certainly would like to include not only the matrix elements at nlo , but likewise the ps in next - to - leading log accuracy .",
    "two problems in combining parton showers and matrix elements can be identified .",
    "first , one has to avoid double counting of events which are included both in the matrix element calculations and in the ps .",
    "second , negative weights can occur in the calculation of the matrix elements at nlo .",
    "although they are not a principle problem , negative weigths can make it in practice difficult to obtain numerically stable results , when they are used as a starting point for the ps .",
    "basically two strategies can be adopted to combine matrix elements and ps s .",
    "either the phase space is split into two parts , using the matrix element cross sections in one region and the ps in the other @xcite , or the ps algorithm is modified as to reproduce the matrix element cross section in the hard limit @xcite . in current event generators such as e.g.  pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite , leading log parton showers are combined with leading order matrix elements in the wide angle scattering region .",
    "recently attempts where made to improve the leading order accuracy in these approaches by going to next - to - leading order . in @xcite both , the ps and the matrix elements were modified to obtain a smooth merge of the ps to the higher order calculation .",
    "collins @xcite suggested a procedure to subtract from the matrix elements those parts which are included already in the ps . since the ps describes the soft and collinear region , the divergences associated with the matrix element calculation in this region are avoided .",
    "finally , sjstrand and friberg @xcite suggested an improvement of the splitting procedure , by using the nlo matrix elements to calculate the weight for the ps region instead of the lo weight .",
    "they suggested to introduce a function which approximates the weight in the ps region in such a way that the negative weight problem is largely avoided .",
    "however , sjstrand and friberg only gave an outline of their method without providing the approximate function for any specific process , and hence they also did not give numerical results .    in this paper , we take the suggestions in @xcite as a starting point and give further details for a general method to get the correct nlo normalization of the ps region . to avoid negative weights ,",
    "we rely on an older suggestion by baer and reno @xcite , based on the phase - space - slicing method .",
    "baer and reno suggested to introduce a phenomenologically determined fixed slicing parameter such that the sum of the born , virtual , soft and collinear contributions is approximately zero . in this paper , we _ calculate _ a scale dependent cut - off function , which provides a cut - off for each phase - space point , such that the sum is _ exactly _ zero and the improved scale and scheme dependence of the nlo calculations is preserved .",
    "the nlo corrections are given by the nlo hard tree - level matrix elements integrated down to the cut - off .",
    "since these contributions are positive definite , the nlo weight obtained from this method can be directly redistributed according to a ps algorithm .",
    "the paper consists of two main parts . in the first part we discuss the general method to combine matrix elements at nlo with ps s by use of",
    "the described cut - off function . in the second part we consider as a physically important and interesting example single - jet production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) . here",
    ", the lo contribution is of order @xmath4 and the nlo corrections are of order @xmath2 . including higher order matrix elements for",
    "this process will become especially important for diffractive dis , since the gluon density in the proton at small @xmath5 is large compared to the quark density .",
    "therefore , the photon - gluon fusion process , which is a nlo correction to the first order quark - parton model contribution , will not necessarily be small .",
    "we explicitly construct and numerically study the cut - off function for this case .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and give an outlook for future developments .",
    "we start by summarizing the procedure for the numerical evaluation of an inclusive @xmath6-jet cross section in nlo qcd .",
    "the first step is to select a jet algorithm , which defines how partons are recombined to give jets . in the following we take for definiteness the invariant mass @xmath7 of two partons @xmath8 and @xmath9 and",
    "define the @xmath6-jet region such that @xmath10 , with some kind of minimum mass @xmath11 and likewise the @xmath12-jet region such that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the lo process for the production of @xmath6 jets consists of @xmath6 final state partons and obviously does not depend on the jet definition .",
    "this dependence only comes in at nlo .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections to this process are given by the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergent one - loop contributions to the @xmath6-parton configuration , which are the virtual corrections , and the nlo tree level matrix elements with @xmath12 partons , the real corrections .",
    "the tree - level matrix elements have to be integrated over the phase space of the additional parton , which gives rise to collinear and soft singularities .",
    "after renormalization , the singularities in the virtual and soft / collinear contributions cancel and remaining poles are absorbed into parton distribution functions .",
    "one wants to integrate most of the phase space of the real corrections numerically , but one needs to find a procedure to calculate the soft / collinear contributions analytically as to explicitly cancel the poles from the virtual corrections .",
    "the two basic methods to perform these integrations are the subtraction method @xcite and the phase - space slicing ( pss ) method @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .    in the following",
    "we will make use of the pss method and therefore discuss this method further . to illustrate the method , we rely on the classical example given by kunszt and soper @xcite .",
    "we label the lo born contribution as @xmath15 .",
    "the nlo cross section is given by the sum of the born cross section and the virtual and real corrections , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : ^=^b + ^v + ^r = ^b + c_v - _ 0 f(0 ) + _ 0 ^ 1 f(x )  .",
    "[ ks - ex ] here , @xmath18 is the known , but complicated function representing the @xmath12-parton matrix elements .",
    "the variable @xmath19 represents an angle between two partons or the energy of a gluon , the integral represents the phase - space intergation that has to be performed over the additional parton .",
    "the singularity of the real corrections at @xmath20 is compensated by the virtual corrections , given by the pole term and some constant , @xmath21 . in the pss method , the integral over the real corrections",
    "is divided into two parts , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the technical cut - off @xmath24 should lie within the @xmath6 jet region , i.e. , if we define @xmath25 , then we should have @xmath26 .",
    "if the cut - off parameter is sufficiently small , @xmath27 , one can write @xmath28 where the integral has been regularized by the term @xmath29 , as suggested by dimensional regularization . the pole is now explicit and the nlo cross section @xmath30 is finite : ^ ^b + c_v + _ ^1",
    "f(x ) + f(0 ) ( )  .",

    "however , an improvement of the above solution is possible by using a hybrid of the pss and the subtraction methods , suggested by glover and sutton @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one adds and subtracts only the universal soft / collinear approximations for @xmath31 , such that @xmath32      + f(0 ) \\ln(\\delta ) +       \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0 } \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}f(0 )   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a cancellation between the analytical and numerical terms still occurs , however only the phase space is approximated , so that this method is valid at larger values of @xmath24 . in the case where the phase - space is not approximated for small @xmath19",
    "the hybrid method becomes independent from @xmath24 .",
    "we would now like to improve the above nlo jet cross section by including the ps in the @xmath6-jet region .",
    "we keep the jet definition , which separates the available phase space into two complementary regions , namely the @xmath6-jet region for @xmath10 and the @xmath12-jet ( hard ) region for @xmath13 .",
    "the nlo corrections , i.e. , the virtual and the soft / collinear corrections , will occur in the @xmath6-jet region , so that the @xmath6-jet exclusive cross section has a nlo normalization . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard @xmath12-jet region contains tree - level contributions only .    in current event generators ,",
    "a weight will be generated in the @xmath6-jet region by calculating the lo , tree - leel matrix element and then redistributing this weight with help of the ps algorithm .",
    "the same jet criterion used to separate the matrix element and ps regions is used to veto events from the ps which would lie outside the @xmath6-jet region , as to avoid double counting .",
    "the @xmath12-jet region is described by the hard @xmath12-parton matrix elements .",
    "if we take the procedure for calculating the nlo corrections as described in the previous section , we could in principle calculate the weight in the @xmath6 jet region in nlo .",
    "however , we would like to avoid the generation of large positive and negative weights , since this is not a practical starting point for an event generator , especially if one wishes to add hadronization after the showering .",
    "therefore we suggest to choose the pss parameter @xmath24 such that the weights are always positive . to keep most of the advantages of the nlo calculation",
    ", we aim to find a cut - off function @xmath33 that provides a cut - off parameter for any given renormalization and factorization scale which lies inside the @xmath6 jet region , such that the sum of the born , soft / collinear and virtual contributions are exactly zero .",
    "the nlo corrections inside the jet are then completely enclosed in the @xmath12-parton hard matrix elements , integrated down to the cut - off function .",
    "only the tree - level matrix elements will serve as starting points for the ps .",
    "the reduced scale and scheme dependence of the nlo cross sections is subsumed into the scale dependent cut - off function .",
    "staying in the simple example from eqn ( [ ks - ex ] ) , the aimed cut - off function reads = ( -- )  .",

    "the nlo corrections are given completely by the hard @xmath12-parton tree - level matrix elements , which are positive definite and can be combined with the ps in the usual way .",
    "the function @xmath34 will depend on the kinematics of the @xmath6 parton configuration , as well as on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "of course , one has to ensure in the event generation process that @xmath35 , i.e.  that the cut - off lies within the @xmath6-jet region .    in general , the function ( [ sol ] ) could yield a relatively large @xmath24 , so that the simple pss method fails to give the correct answer for the nlo cross section .",

    ", the difference between the approximate function @xmath37 and the full expression is evaluated numerically .",
    "this is similar to the what sjstrand and friberg suggested in @xcite as a starting point for the event generation .",
    "to summarize , we propose in close analogy to @xcite the following steps to produce an event in the ps region with positive weight and nlo normalization :    * define the @xmath6-jet region by s_ij < q^2 for all partons @xmath14 . the @xmath12-jet region given by @xmath38",

    "[ f2 ]  a we see how the logarithmic @xmath11 dependence of the two - parton final states is compensated by the one - parton final states to give an @xmath11 independent result of @xmath121  nb up to values of @xmath122  gev@xmath102 . above that value a slight variation of the sum can be observed and the @xmath11 independence is no longer ensured . for @xmath123  gev@xmath102",
    "the one - parton final state obviously fails to give a correct @xmath11 dependence and the sum of one- and two - parton final states strongly decreases .",
    "we note that at even larger @xmath11 values , the one - parton final states will again give zero , which is the second solution of ( [ step ] ) which we rejected in ( [ master ] ) . as an important result",
    ", one also sees that the value of @xmath11 , for which the one - parton final states vanish and the two - parton final states give the full answer is well within the @xmath11 independent region . indeed , after we have introduced our @xmath89-function into the mepjet program we found that the one - parton final states did give zero and as a result for the two - parton final state we found @xmath124  nb , which agrees with the answer for small @xmath11 very well .",
    "similar results hold for the larger @xmath99 ranges , fig .",

    "the point at which the nlo one - parton final state contributions vanish are well within the @xmath11 independent region .",

    "the actual bins are summarized in tab .",
    "in addition , we have tested the scale dependence by varying the squared renormalization and factorization scales together by a factor of 4 , i.e. , @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",

    "the overall scale dependence is small , indicating a very good perturbative stability , as to be expected .",
    "however , it was not our intention to test the scale dependence , but to test whether our @xmath89 function would reproduce the scale behaviour correctly .",
    "this concludes our numerical studies , showing the equivalence of the standard pss method with our modified approach by integrating out only the two - parton final states down to a dynamical @xmath89 function given by eqn  ( [ master ] ) .",
    "we have given a prescription for combining fixed nlo matrix elements with ps s within the pss method .",
    "it consists in removing the born , virtual and soft / collinear contributions from the nlo cross section for the @xmath6-jet region by adjusting the pss parameter @xmath11 for each phase space point and each scale @xmath134 .",
    "these contributions are then included in the hard part of the nlo matrix elements , which are positive definite .",
    "this allows to directly redistribute the weight provided from these matrix elements with a ps algorithm .    for the case of inclusive single - jet production in @xmath1-scattering at @xmath0",
    "we have calculated the dynamical @xmath11 parameter for each phase space point @xmath19 and @xmath99 and each scale @xmath134 .",
    "we have numerically compared the standard calculation with our new approach of evaluating fixed nlo contributions and found the new approach to give reliable results .",
    "we especially found that the values of @xmath11 , for which the virtual plus soft / collinear contributions vanish , are small enough for the soft and collinear approximations , used in in the pss method , to be valid .",
    "we note that the cut - off function has been successfully implemented in the rapgap event generator @xcite , which includes the @xmath0 tree level matrix elements .",
    "numerical results and comparison to data will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the next , more complicated step is the case of dijet production in @xmath1-scattering , which is especially interesting because it allows a precise determination of @xmath2 or the gluon density in the proton .",

    "it might turn out that the pss method has to be suplemented with the hybrid method to numerically evaluate terms of order @xmath135 as outlined in section 2 .",
    "nlo calculations within the subtraction method are available for dijet production in @xmath1-scattering @xcite , so that the expressions needed for the hybrid of pss and subtraction method can readily be evaluated .",
