    "vv orionis ( hd 36695 ) is a bright ( @xmath4=5.4 ) , double - lined eclipsing binary consisting of main sequence b - type stars in a detached configuration .",
    "the inclination is high enough to produce complete eclipses , enabling the very accurate determination of fundamental parameters of the system . since the discovery of its photometric variability over a century ago",
    ", the system has been the subject of several spectroscopic and photometric studies as discussed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the derived absolute parameters in these previous studies vary considerably and this led us to obtain additional spectroscopic and photometric data on the system as part of our program on early - type binaries ( viz .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "dating back to the first comprehensive spectroscopic study by @xcite , spectroscopic investigators , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , have concluded that a third star orbits the eclipsing pair .",
    "the evidence for claims of this third body rests solely on higher than expected residuals in fits to the radial velocities of the primary as the third body s lines are not seen in the system s spectrum .",
    "@xcite offered the third body hypothesis `` with great reserve '' and @xcite pointed out that the observed variation in the systemic velocity did not necessarily imply that the system was a triple .",
    "@xcite analyzed his radial velocities along with those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to arrive at orbital parameters for a third body orbiting with a period of about 119 days .",
    "a goal of the current study was to investigate this third body hypothesis .",
    "vv ori was observed with a 0.25 m schmidt - cassegrain telescope , santa barbara instrument group st-7xe ccd camera and standard @xmath5 filters .",
    "the main goal of the new photometric observations was to cover at least one primary eclipse for the purpose of extending the baseline of eclipse timings so that any small changes in the period could be detected . given the extensive photometric datasets previously published , we did not attempt to observe complete light curves for the system .    the ccd images were reduced using iraf .",
    "bias and dark frame subtraction and flatfielding were done in the usual way .",
    "pyraf scripts automated the frame calibrations and aperture phometry which was performed using the iraf daofind and phot routines .",
    "the comparison star for the differential photometry was hd 36779 .",
    "high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra of vv  ori were obtained with the echelle+ccd spectrograph of the 1.82 m telescope operated in asiago by the inaf astronomical observatory of padova .",
    "the ccd is an e2v thinned , back illuminated 1k@xmath61k chip of 13.5 @xmath7 m pixel size .",
    "the slit was always aligned with the parallactic angle and its projected width was 1.5 arcsec . the spectra cover the range from atmospheric cut - off around 3250  to 7100  at a resolving power 30,000 .",
    "the accuracy of the zero point of the wavelength scale is derived on each observed spectrum by cross - correlation against a synthetic template of the rich telluric absorption spectrum at wavelengths 6860 - 7050 , 6270 - 6310 , 5880 - 5950   and found to be affected by no systematic shift larger than 0.2 km sec@xmath8 , consistent with the high efficiency of the instrument in deriving accurate radial velocities evaluated by @xcite .",
    "the exposure times for the spectra were 5 minutes ( 0.002 in orbital phase ) , eliminating any concerns about phase smearing effects on the radial velocities . in all , 31 spectra were obtained over the period from november , 2004 to february , 2006 .",
    "figure [ heplot ] shows the appearance of the 5876  line near quadratures .",
    "the weakness of the secondary s lines illustrates the need for high - resolution , high signal - to - noise observations when trying to measure the radial velocity of the secondary . because of the weakness of the secondary s lines , its radial velocities",
    "could only be accurately measured near quadratures when the blending with the primary s lines was minimized .",
    "is the orbital phase .",
    "the interstellar sodium doublet and the telluric h@xmath9o absorption lines longward of 5885    are also marked.,width=317 ]      the lines have two interstellar components with radial velocities of + 9.3@xmath100.2 and + 26.1@xmath100.1 km sec@xmath8 .",
    "the fwhm of both components is 14.4 km / sec , which is dominated by the instrumental psf .",
    "the equivalent widths of the two components are 0.066@xmath100.003 and 0.160@xmath100.006     for the d2 line at 5890 , and 0.040@xmath100.002 and 0.130@xmath100.005     for the d1 line at 5896 . using the @xcite calibration on nai line at 5890  this corresponds to a reddening of e(b - v)=0.078@xmath100.004",
    ".        the tycho @xmath11 corresponds , according to @xcite , to a johnson @xmath12 .",
    "we denote an intrinsic ( _ i.e. , unreddened ) color by @xmath13 and an observed color by @xmath14 with subscripts @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denoting the primary component , the secondary component and the composite value for the binary respectively . with an assumed intrinsic color for the primary , @xmath18 , and the magnitude differences between the two components in each filter , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , from our light curve solution",
    ", we can compute the intrinsic composite color of the binary , @xmath21 , as @xmath22 assuming a value of @xmath23 for the b1v primary @xcite and the @xmath19 and @xmath20 values of 2.58 and 2.49 respectively from the light curve solution , we find @xmath24 .",
    "this result , combined with the observed @xmath25 , yields a reddening of @xmath26 , in good agreement with the results from the analysis of the interstellar lines .",
    "these values also agree well with the value of 0.07 measured by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_      radial velocity measurements for the primary have been derived from measurements of seven hydrogen balmer lines ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , h8 , h9 ) and eight lines ( 7065 , 5876 , 5016 , 4472 , 4388 , 4026 , 4009 , 3820  ) .",
    "given the weakness of its spectral features ( cf .",
    "figure [ heplot ] ) , the measurement of the radial velocity of the secondary star has been possible only in a few spectra , those with the highest s / n near quadrature , and for only a subset of the lines .",
    "table  2 gives the radial velocities of both components .",
    "[ rvtable ]    .heliocentric radial velocities of vv  ori . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      photometry from chambliss and leung ( 1982 ) and the computed light curves .",
    "the @xmath32 data were not used in the final solution and are shown only to illustrate the nature of the fitting difficulties.,width=317 ]     photometry from chambliss and leung ( 1982 ) and the computed light curves.,width=317 ]        assuming a ratio of total to selective absorption of @xmath33 and using the bolometric corrections from @xcite , we find that the distance to vv  ori is 388 @xmath10 30 parsecs with the error dominated by the uncertainty in the effective temperature of the primary .",
    "unfortunately , the hipparcos parallax is not very precise , yielding a @xmath34 distance range of 390pc to 1060 pc .",
    "our distance places the system in the orion ob1 association consistent with the distance to the 1a subgroup @xcite measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that the age of vv  ori is 10 @xmath10 1 myr .",
    "this value , along with the age found from our evolutionary calculations , supports the membership of vv  ori in the 1a subgroup of orion ob1 whose age was measured to be 11.4 @xmath10 1.9 myr .",
    "the barycentric radial velocity we measure , @xmath35 km sec@xmath8 , agrees well with the average radial velocity of the ori ob1 members found by @xcite.at the galactic latitude of @xmath36 and our distance , vv  ori is 110 pc from the galactic plane , within the scale height of the galactic thin disk .",
    "@xcite was the first to suggest the existence of a tertiary component in vv  ori .",
    "larger than expected residuals from the fit to his radial velocity observations of the primary led him to examine the possibility of a third body and he gave orbital parameters for it `` with great reserve ... and not with any idea that they are even approximately true . '' later , @xcite also noted systematic trends in the residuals to the fits of their velocities but did not feel justified in solving for the orbit of a third body , stating that `` ... we can not be certain that the slow variation necessarily means that the system is triple . ''",
    "@xcite analyzed the velocity residuals for the @xcite , @xcite and @xcite data sets , as well as his own , concluding that a third body orbit with an period of about 119 days fit the data best . assuming an inclination of @xmath37 for the orbit of the third body , he estimated that its spectral type was mid - to - late a and its luminosity was 13 - 14 @xmath38 .",
    "we repeated our light and velocity curve analysis after adding the velocities from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to study the behaviour of the velocity residuals for each radial velocity data set .",
    "all radial velocities were given equal weight in the solution .",
    "figure [ residualfit ] shows the velocity residuals for the four sets of data phased with the third body ephemeris given by @xcite .",
    "while the older data appear to show systematic trends , our more precise data do not , but we , unfortunately , do not have full coverage of the purported third body orbit .",
    "one intriguing result of the analysis is a statistically significant value for the time derivative of the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the solution converged on a value of @xmath39 , perhaps indicating accretion of the primary s wind by the secondary .",
    "we do not attach much significance to this result , its reality having to be assessed against additional precise radial velocities and accurate timing of eclipses to be secured in the years to come . in the case of conservative mass transfer between the two components ,",
    "the mass exchange would amount to @xmath40 .",
    "this material would be easily ionized by the radiation field of the b1 v primary , and should give rise to emission lines easily detectable in high resolution spectra .",
    "ours do not show any hint of emission lines originating in vv ori        another way to test for the existence of the third body , as pointed out by @xcite , is through its effect on the o - c diagram for times of minimum of the binary .",
    "unfortunately , vv  ori has not been a frequent target of observers of times of minimum . a concerted effort to observe as many times of minimum as possible over a couple of observing seasons",
    "could prove valuable in answering this critical question .",
    "@xcite predicts that the double amplitude of the variation would be 0.0014 days , a measurement within reach of a small telescope equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "given the large scatter in the older radial velocity data sets , the lack of any evidence for third light in the light curves and the lack of systematic trends in the residuals of our radial velocities , we see no strong evidence to support claims of the existence of a third body in vv  ori",
    ". more extensive radial velocity and time of minimum studies should be able to resolve the question with greater certainty .",
    "vv ori consists of a b1 v primary with @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a b4.5 v secondary with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the derived distance of 388 @xmath10 30 pc and barycentric velocity of @xmath41 km sec@xmath8 are consistent with the system s membership in the orion ob1 association .",
    "we find no evidence of third light in the photometric data and the new radial velocities , although somewhat limited in temporal coverage , show no evidence of the third body discussed by previous authors .",
