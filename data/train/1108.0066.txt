    "based on the photoionization assumption and the time lags between both variations of broad emission lines and continuum , reverberation mapping observations are able to determine the sizes of broad - line regions ( blr ) for type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the classical reverberation mapping is very successful in estimates of the blr sizes . in these reverberation mapping observations ,",
    "the stratified ionization structures of the blrs are found for various types of broad emission lines , such as the balmer lines and the heii and hei lines seen in ngc 5548 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mrk 110 @xcite , and the balmer lines and the ly@xmath1 and c iv lines seen in 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "the higher ionized lines respond systematically faster to the continuum variations .",
    "the separation of emission regions for these lines spans a large range .",
    "the higher ionized lines are emitted at the smaller distances from the ionizing continuum source .",
    "the photoionization assumption requires that the frequency of ionizing continuum must not be lower than those of the emission lines produced through the photoionization process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical continua are used as the ionizing continuum in these reverberation mapping observations .",
    "this treatment leads to underestimation of the blr sizes @xmath15 , as seen in e.g. 3c 273 @xcite . for the balmer lines of 3c 273 , the blr sizes derived from the uv continuum around 1300 @xmath16 are between 2 and 4 times larger than those from the optical continuum around 5000 @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , their estimates are in excellent agreement with each other @xcite , while in @xcite the h@xmath1 lag is 60 per cent larger than that of h@xmath4 .",
    "it seems to be appropriate to regard the uv continuum as the ionizing continuum of the balmer lines . for the uv lines ly@xmath1 and c iv",
    ", it should be appropriate to regard the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray continua as the ionizing continuum .",
    "@xcite regarded the euv photons as the ionizing source of h@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite showed that the soft x - rays are better to represent the ionizing flux .",
    "the photons above 912 @xmath16 are believed to be the main sources of line formation via photoionization , and they should be related to the emission lines seen in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and optical regimes @xcite .",
    "thus it seems to be inapposite of using the uv continuum as the ionizing continuum of the uv lines to estimate the blr sizes .",
    "disturbances in the central engine are likely transported outward along the relativistic jets .",
    "this was supported by observations that dips in the x - ray emission are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jets of agns @xcite .",
    "the events in the central engine will have a direct effect on the events in the radio jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the reverberation mapping model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the events in the central engine also have a direct effect on the events in the blr through the photoionization process .",
    "thus it is expected that there should exist correlations between both variations of the broad emission lines from the blr and the radio emission from the relativistic jet aligned with the line of sight .",
    "especially , the correlations have time lags of the broad lines relative to the radio emission and the time lags are related to the position of radio emitting region @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "both optical and uv lines should give the same @xmath17 from their time lags relative to the radio emission .",
    "in this paper , we give a method to estimate the blr sizes of the uv lines from the blr sizes of the optical lines and their time lags relative to the radio emission .",
    "according to equation ( 7 ) in paper i , we have a relation between @xmath17 , @xmath15 and @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21 is the travelling speed of disturbances down the jet , @xmath22 is the viewing angle of the jet axis to the line of sight and @xmath23 is the measured time lag of the radio emission relative to the broad lines .",
    "both the optical and uv lines should give the same @xmath17 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath24 that gives @xmath25 where @xmath0 is the blr size of the uv lines , @xmath26 is the blr size of the optical lines , @xmath2 is the measured time lag of the radio emission relative to the uv lines and @xmath27 is the measured time lag of the radio emission relative to the optical lines .    for the uv and optical broad emission lines , one can estimate the time lags of lines by using the radio emission as the common reference . as @xmath2 and @xmath27",
    "are measured , one can estimate @xmath0 from @xmath26 , which is obtained in the reverberation mapping for the optical lines with an appropriate ionizing continuum .",
    "this new method can improve the classical reverberation mapping , especially on blazars that have strongly beamed emission at optical , uv and x - ray bands and also have strong radio emission .",
    "the flat spectrum radio quasar 3c 273 was first identified as a quasar at redshift @xmath28 by @xcite .",

    ", the relevant time lags generally decrease as radio frequency increases from 5 to 37 ghz .",
    "this trend most likely results from the radiative cooling of relativistic electrons ( see paper i ) .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained in paper i. hereafter , @xmath29 is equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "the uncertainties of each point in the zdcfs only take into account the uncertainties from the measurements by monte carlo simulation .",
    "thus the uncertainties in the cross - correlation results will be estimated by using the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method described by @xcite .",
    "the quantities we concerned are related with the time lags of ly@xmath1 , civ , h@xmath1 , h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 relative to the 37 ghz emission .",

    "* ) . for blazars",
    ", the central ionizing continua will be strongly contaminated by the beamed emission from the relativistic jets , so that the blue - bump is not observable for most of blazars .",
    "@xcite showed for 3c 273 that the optical continuum is strongly contaminated by the beamed emission from the relativistic jet and it appears unsuitable for studying the time lags between the ionizing continuum and the lines .",
    "@xcite argued that the uv continuum is much closer to the ionizing continuum than the optical continuum used by @xcite .",
    "they used the 1300 @xmath16 continuum to infer the time lags of the balmer lines and found better estimate for the optical blr than @xcite .",
    "the underlying physical condition in the photoionization model is that the frequencies of ionizing photons must not be lower than those of the emission lines generated via the photoionization process .",
    "thus it is appropriate to regard the 1300 @xmath16 continuum as the ionizing continuum of the h@xmath1 , h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 lines , because that its frequency is higher than those of the lines .",
    "however , it should not be appropriate to regard the 1300 @xmath16 continuum as the ionizing continuum of the ly@xmath1 line , because that its frequency is less than that of the line .",
    "there are several fundamental assumptions made in the reverberation mapping , and",
    "one of them is that there is a simple , although not necessarily linear , relationship between the observable continuum and the ionizing continuum that is driving the lines @xcite . the assumption can not be tested directly .",
    "the close correspondence between continuum and line light curves gives us some confidence that this assumption is valid at some level of approximation @xcite .",
    "however , observations indicate a complicated relationship between variations of optical / uv and euv / x - ray bands , e.g. seyfert type 1 agn ngc 4051 @xcite .",
    "the complex x - ray , euv , uv and optical correlations are explained as a possible combination of x - ray reprocessing , thermal compton up - scattering of optical / uv seed photons and disturbances propagating from outer ( optically emitting ) parts of accretion disc into its inner ( x - ray emitting ) region @xcite .",
    "the complex relationships between these bands indicate that it is difficult to choose the ionizing continuum and its appropriate agency .",
    "this new method we proposed to estimate the blr size of the uv lines could avoid the choice of the ionizing continuum and its agency .",
    "the complex relationships between the uv , euv and x - ray continuum light curves may depend on the origin of energies emitted at these bands .",
    "if the uv continuum is produced via thermal reprocessing of the x - rays , the x - rays will lead the uv photons .",
    "if the uv , euv and x - rays are generated via viscous dissipation in accretion disc , the uv will lead the euv and x - rays .",
    "the euv and x - ray emission might be from the same origin .",
    "observations of ngc 5548 on @xmath50 ten days show no time lag of x - rays from euv flux on time scales longer than a day @xcite .",
    "if the x - rays are produced by the up - scattering of uv seed photons , e.g. the x - rays are generated in hotter corona and the uv seed photons are from disc , the uv variations will lead the x - rays .",
    "the lag of the x - rays relative to the uv variations corresponds to the light - travel time between the seed photon source and a compton up - scattering region .",
    "this case seems to be supported by observations of ngc 3516 that the optical variations lead the x - rays by @xmath50 100 days @xcite .",
    "their monitoring lasted for @xmath50 550 days .",
    "they showed that the correlation signal at 100 days is entirely due to the slow ( variability time scale @xmath51 30 days ) components of the light curves . during the whole monitoring period",
    ", the more rapidly changing components of the light curves are uncorrelated at any lag .",
    "the light - travel distance of this lag of x - rays relative to optical variations is much larger than the blr size of @xmath50 11 light - days @xcite .",
    "these outbursts , which dominate this lag of @xmath50 100 days , in the optical and x - ray light curves have a variability time scale of the order of @xmath50 100 days .",
    "observations of ngc 5548 on @xmath50 ten days show that the time lag between the euv and x - ray flux is negligible relative to the light - travel time of the blr size ( see * ? ? ?",
    "observations of ngc 3783 spanning 2 yr show that the optical light curves lag the x - rays by 39 days @xcite .",
    "this delay points at optical variability produced by x - ray reprocessing .",
    "this time lag is comparable to that of optical lines relative to the continuum , @xmath50 8 days @xcite .",
    "the large time lags between these continuum bands should exist in the long - term correlations , e.g. ngc 3516 .",
    "the small lags should exist in the short - term correlations , e.g. ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 @xcite .",
    "the light curves used to estimate the lags for ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 span time intervals @xmath52 30 days .",
    "it is possible that the light curves used to measure the lags do not have enough time spans , so that the large lags can not be measured even if indeed they exist .",
    "these observational facts indicate complex relationships between these continuum bands and between the time lags within these bands and the blr sizes .",
    "thus the choice of ionizing continuum would significantly influence the time lags of emission lines relative to the observable continua , e.g. 3c 273 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to the results of this paper , if the uv blr size is taken to be 2.6 ly for 3c 273 , which means that if we had known the light curve of the ionizing continuum ( say the x - ray light curve ) , the time lag would have been 2.6 yr . on the other hand , the uv lines are lagging the uv continuum by about 1.5 yr @xcite .",
    "this means that the uv continuum light curve must lag the x - ray light curve by about 1.1 yr , which means that the uv emitting place is far from the x - ray emitting place by 1.1 ly .",
    "the uv continuum light curve has a characteristic variability time scale @xmath50 2.0 yr , which is estimated from the zero - crossing time of the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of its light curve .",
    "the zero - crossing time of the acf of light curve is a well - defined quantity and is used as a characteristic variability time scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a simple relation between the acf and the first - order structure function that is used in variability studies to estimate the variability time scale @xcite .",
    "if this characteristic time scale @xmath50 2.0 yr corresponds to the size of the uv emitting region in accretion disc , the uv emitting position will be @xmath50 1.0 ly far from the place that emits the x - rays .",
    "this distance of @xmath50 1.0 ly is consistent with that value of @xmath50 1.1 ly deduced above .",
    "thus it is a reasonable size for the accretion disc , wherein the place that emits the uv continuum is far from the place that emits the x - rays by 1.1 ly .    for the balmer lines h@xmath1 ,",
    "h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 of 3c 273 , the blr sizes derived from the 1300 @xmath16 continuum are between 2 and 4 times larger than those from the optical continuum around 5000 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their estimates are in excellent agreement with each other , while in @xcite the h@xmath1 lag is 60 per cent larger than that of h@xmath4 .",
    "thus the lines ly@xmath1 and c iv should have larger blr sizes as the soft x - rays rather than the 1300 @xmath16 continuum are taken to be the ionizing continuum .",

    "our results seem to depart from the stratified ionization structures obtained in the classical mapping .    the new method proposed in this paper",
    "is based on the method proposed in paper i. the key of the two methods requires that the central disturbance signals are transported to the blr and the jets .",

    "civ , there are the same cases as in the balmer lines ( see table 1 ) . the measured lags @xmath60 between the 5 , 8 , 15 , 22 and 37 ghz emission were compared with the differences of @xmath61 between @xmath29 for the balmer lines ( see fig . 7 in paper",
