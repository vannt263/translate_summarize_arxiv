    "a substantial amount of work@xcite has been done recently towards emergent matter as topological invariants of framed spin networks , embedded in a topological three - manifold@xcite and unembedded@xcite , as fundamental states of quantum gravity and quantum geometry .",
    "some papers study the case of framed three - valent spin networks@xcite , which were motivated by the pioneer work of bilson - thompson @xcite .",
    "others investigate the three - strand braids of four - valent spin networks embedded in a topological three manifold@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an effective description of these emergent local excitations@xcite in the language of feynman diagrams . as an analogy effective emergent degrees of freedom have been realized in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , there are emergent quasiparticles as collective modes in some condensed matter systems , such as phonons and rotons in superfluid he@xmath0 .",
    "another example is the string - net condensation which gives rise to low energy effective gauge theories@xcite .",
    "the three - valent case considered in @xcite is limited by lack of creation and annihilation of the topological invariants@xcite which are considered corresponding to standard model particles@xcite .",
    "this partly motivates our work in the four - valent case@xcite in which the topological excitations can propagate and interact under the dual pachner moves@xcite .",
    "the four - valent spin networks here can be understood as those naturally occur in spin foam models@xcite , or in a more generic sense as the original proposal of spin networks put forward by penrose@xcite .",
    "another motivation of working with four - valent spin networks is that the vertices correspond to three - dimensional space .",
    "the dynamical entities being studied in the four - valent case are three - strand braids , each of which is formed by the three common edges of two adjacent nodes of a spin network . with the graphic notation and the classification of these three - strand braids obtained in @xcite , @xcite discovers that stable three - strand braids , which are thought to be local excitations@xcite exist under certain stability condition . among the stable braids",
    ", there is a small class of braids , called * propagating braids * , which can propagate on the spin network .",
    "the braid propagation is chiral , in the sense that some braids can only propagate to their left in their ambient local graphs , whereas some only propagate to their right and some do both@xcite .",
    "there is another small class of braids , the * actively - interacting braids * ; each is two - way propagating and is able to merge with its neighboring braid to form a new one@xcite .",
    "stable braids that are not propagating are christened * stationary braids*.    keeping the graphic calculus of the braids developed in @xcite , @xcite proposed an algebraic calculus , which has been used to find out the conserved quantities of braids , which are mapped to possible quantum numbers such as electric charges , and the c , p , and t of our braids@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite shows that all actively interacting braids form a noncommutative algebra of which the product ( binary operation ) is braid interaction , and that an actively interacting braid behaves like a map , taking a non - actively interacting braid to another non - actively interacting one .",
    "however , each braid interaction of the type discussed so far in @xcite must always involve at least one actively - interacting braid . in this paper",
    "we will investigate a new type of interaction which takes two adjacent braids to another two adjacent braids via exchanging a virtual actively interacting braid .",
    "this seems to imply that actively interacting braids behave like bosons whereas the others - in particular the chiral propagating braids - may be candidates for fermions .",
    "most importantly , the dynamics of braids can be represented by braid feynman diagrams , based on which an effective field theory of the braids exists .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "two neighboring braids may have an exchange interaction , i.e. they interact via exchanging a virtual actively interacting braid , resulting in two different adjacent braids .",
    "effective twists and effective states of braids are conversed under exchange interaction .",
    "exchange interaction is asymmetric in general ; however , conditions for an exchange interaction to be symmetric are given .",
    "4 .   braids can radiate actively interacting braids .",
    "actively interacting braids behave analogously to bosons .",
    "braid feynman diagrams representing braid dynamics are proposed .",
    "a constraint on probability amplitudes of braid dynamics is obtained .    in most of this paper",
    "we do not take into account the labels which usually grace the edges and nodes of spin networks because the existence and stability of the braid excitations we study do not depend on them .",
    "nevertheless , this paper will urge the incorporation of spin network labels , in the traditional way or in a more generalized way , in our next work , such that methods in certain spin foam models , in group field theories , or in tensor categories can be adopted ( and modified ) .",
    "a 3-strand braid , formed by the three common edges of two adjacent nodes , is in fact an equivalence class of diffeomorphic local sub networks of the whole framed spin network embedded in a topological 3-manifold .",
    "we study a braid through its 2-dimensional projection , called a * braid diagram*. we therefore will not distinguish braids from braid diagrams unless an ambiguity arises .",
    "a generic example of such a braid diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ braid](a ) .",
    "although the properties of a braid should not depend on which representative is chosen for the equivalence class , in some cases an appropriate representative makes things easier .",
    "[ h ]    braid    in @xcite our choice was to represent an equivalence class by a braid diagram which has zero external twists .",
    "this simplifies the interaction condition and the graphic calculus developed in @xcite .",
    "each class has one and only one such representative .",
    "thus a braid represented this way is said to be in its * unique representation*. this representation is important because according to @xcite , each multiplet of actively interacting braids under the discrete transformations , which are analogous to the c , p , and t in particle physics , found in @xcite is uniquely characterized by a non - negative integer , viz the number of crossings of the braids in their unique representations in the multiplet . in this paper",
    "we will use the unique representation exclusively .    along with the graphic calculus ,",
    "an algebraic notation and the corresponding calculational method of braid interactions were put forward in @xcite .",
    "this algebraic formalism plays a key role in finding the conserved quantities of braids and the discrete transformations mapped to c , p , t , and their combinations , in @xcite .",
    "we will use both the graphic and algebraic calculus in this paper .",

    "a crossing sequence is generated by the four generators shown in fig .",
    "[ braid](b ) , and can then be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "it is useful to define the quantity @xmath9 for @xmath2@xcite .",
    "so clearly @xmath10 , meaning no crossing .",
    "the generators are assigned integral values according to their handedness , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , crossings of a braid can also be summed over to obtain an integer , the * crossing number * : @xmath13 , of the braid , where @xmath14 is the number of crossings .",
    "the @xmath2 of a braid induces a permutation @xmath15 , an element in the permutation group @xmath16 , of the three strands of the braid .",
    "the triple of internal twists on the left of @xmath2 and the one of the right of @xmath2 are thus related by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "that is , @xmath15 is a left - acting function of the triple of internal twists , while its inverse , @xmath19 is right - acting .",
    "the inverse relation between @xmath15 and @xmath19 is understood as : @xmath20 note that the twists such as @xmath4 and @xmath21 are abstract and have no concrete meaning until their values and positions in a triple are fixed .",
    "thus , @xmath22 means @xmath23 , etc , and @xmath24 .",
    "note also that the @xmath15 in the out most layer in the notation should be kept formal rather than an explicit element in @xmath16 because the @xmath2 is needed to record the crossing sequence . for example , if we obtain a braid , say @xmath25^{s_r}_{t_r}\\right.,$ ] in some process , then while we can write the @xmath26 as @xmath27 to complete the addition in the parenthesis , we should keep @xmath28 as it is but not explicitly as @xmath29 .",
    "the relation between @xmath15 and its inverse suggests that a generic braid can be equally denoted by @xmath30^{s_r}_{t_r}\\right .. \\ ] ]    given this notation , we express a braid in its unique representation as @xmath31^{s_r}_{0}\\right.,\\ ] ] or simply @xmath32^{s_r}\\right.$ ] , dropping out the zero s .",
    "we have shown the algebraic structure of the set of all stable 3-strand braids in @xcite under the braid interaction found in @xcite .",
    "hence , we choose to denote the set of stable braids by @xmath33 .",
    "however , for reasons which will become transparent in the sequel we should enlarge @xmath33 by adding two more braids : @xmath34^{\\pm}_0\\right.,\\label{eqb0pm}\\ ] ] which are completely trivial are not just two braids , but infinite number of braids because they can be colored by different sets of spin network labels , so is any other braid in @xmath35 .",
    "2 ) @xmath36 are only trivial topologically but not algebraically and neither physically . ] .",
    "@xmath36 are actually unstable according to @xcite because they are dual to a 3-ball .",
    "if we tolerate their instability they are obviously actively interacting . bearing this in mind ,",
    "let us still call the enlarged set the set of stable braids but use @xmath35 as its notation .",
    "according to @xcite , @xmath35 can be divided into the disjoint union of three subsets : the subset of all actively interacting braids ( including @xmath36 ) , the subset of all propagating braids which are do not actively interact , and the subset of stationary braids which are passive in all interactions and do not propagate ; they are denoted respectively by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath40 moreover , the set of propagating - only braids @xmath38 can be further divided as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the subset of braids which only propagate to the left , @xmath43 is the subset of braids which only propagate to the right , and @xmath44 contains two - way propagating braids .    because a new type of interaction will be introduced in this paper , to get rid of any possible confusion we call the interaction introduced in @xcite the _ direct interaction _ and notate it by @xmath45 , while name the new interaction _ exchange interaction _ for reasons will be clear when it is defined , denoted as @xmath46 . as a consequence",
    ", a bare @xmath47 sign between two braids only means the adjacency of the braids .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , @xmath37 is closed under the direct interaction , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "this will help to make the algebraic structure of braids and the contact of our model with particle physics clearer .",
    "@xcite has shown that two neighboring braids may interact and merge into a new braid .",
    "this process is called direct interaction .",
    "one of the two braids in a direct interaction must be an actively interacting braid .",
    "that is , we only have the following possible direct interactions : @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "fortunately , there exists , as we are to show , another type of interaction , namely the exchange interaction , which can take two adjacent braids in @xmath51 to another two neighboring ones in the same set .",
    "in fact , exchange interaction can be defined on the whole @xmath35 as a map , @xmath52 .",
    "it will be clear shortly that there is always an exchange of a virtual actively interacting braid in an exchange interaction , giving why exchange interaction is so christened .",
    "it is useful to keep track of the direction of the exchange of the actively interacting braid during an exchange interaction .",
    "therefore , we differentiate a _ left _ and a _ right exchange interaction _ , respectively denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the arrow indicates the `` flow '' of the virtual actively interacting braid .    the graphic definition of right exchange interaction is illustrated in fig . [ type2intdef ] .",
    "the left one can be defined likewise .",
    "we now explain with the help of our algebraic notation the process in detail as follows .    1 .",
    "we begin with the two adjacent braids , @xmath55 in fig .",

    "we also assume that @xmath58 is right - reducible ( not necessarily fully right - reducible ) , such that the crossing sequence of @xmath58 has a maximal reducible segment , say @xmath61 , as shown in the figure .",
    "the reason for this will be clear soon .",
    "( similarly , for left exchange interaction one should have @xmath59 left - reducible .",
    "if @xmath58 is right - reducible and @xmath59 is left - reducible , both left and right exchange interactions may occur but they lead to different results in general . )",
    "2 .   a @xmath62 move on the two nodes in the state",
    "@xmath60 now leads to fig .",
    "[ type2intdef](b ) .",
    "the dashed lines simply means the crossing relation between the green lines and black ones can not be determined unless we know what exactly the state @xmath60 is .",

    "@xmath219 must be summed over due to the independence of the final result on @xmath83 .",
    "there are analogies of this summation in usual quantum field theories , e.g. the integration over the momentum defining the propagator of the virtual particle in an interaction , and the summation over polarizations of gauge bosons .",
    "[ eqm ] is generic though is derived with the help of a specific example because one can simply replace the exchange interaction on the lhs with any other one and substitute the corresponding direct interaction and decay on the rhs simultaneously .",

    "despite the lack of a fully fundamental theory of quantum gravity with matter , an effective theory of topological excitations , such as our braids , of quantum geometry may be more relevant to the testable region of our physical world .",

    "however , the way to define the probability amplitude of an evolution move in our situation should be modified because all current spin foam models are unembedded but our spin networks are embedded in a topological 3-manifold , which means that not only spin network labels but also the topological quantities defining the braids should be considered .",

    "<S> these have been shown previously to propagate and interact under evolution rules of spin foam models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dynamics of these braid excitations can be described by an effective theory based on feynman diagrams . in this language , braids which are actively interacting are analogous to bosons , in that the topological conservation laws permit them to be singly created and destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> exchanges of these excitations give rise to interactions between braids which are charged under the topological conservation rules . </S>"
