    "@xcite recently showed a new variant for calculating the comoving distance @xmath7 between two objects at cosmological distances , given their redshifts and angular separation .",
    "however , given two celestial positions ( in right ascension and declination ) @xmath8 , before @xmath7 can be calculated via equation ( 7 ) of @xcite , it is first necessary to calculate the angle @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath10 in the notation of @xcite ) between these two positions .    this angle can be calculated either by converting the angles to points in euclidean 3-space , taking the inner product ( dot product ) of these two points treated as vectors , and inverting the cosine relation between the inner product and @xmath9 , or via a spherical trigonometry formula involving sines and cosines .    however , the calculation of @xmath7 is very closely analogous to the calculation of @xmath9 , apart from the addition of a dimension , a change in signature of the metric in the case of hyperbolic space ( an ` open ' universe ) , and multiplication by the curvature radius .",
    "the generalisation from the arc - length @xmath11 in three - dimensional space to an ` arc - length ' @xmath7 in four - dimensional space is conceptually straight - forward if the inner product is used .    in other words ,",
    "use of the inner product in cartesian coordinates provides a method of obtaining @xmath7 , given the density parameter @xmath12 the cosmological constant @xmath13 the hubble constant @xmath14 , and the redshifts , right ascensions and declinations of two objects , @xmath15 , via the definitions and equations in eq .",

    "the use of the inner product to calculate @xmath9 [ denoted @xmath10 in the notation of @xcite ] in three dimensions is described in [ s - twod ] , and its generalisation to the calculation of @xmath7 ( in four dimensions ) is derived in [ s - threed ] .",
    "given two celestial positions in spherical polar ( e.g. equatorial ) coordinates @xmath16 , these can be converted to cartesian coordinates @xmath17 on the celestial sphere of arbitrary radius @xmath18 ( e.g. @xmath19 ) .    the standard euclidean inner product on the two vectors @xmath20 , can then be expressed either as @xmath21 or as @xmath22    equations ( [ e - cartes2d ] ) , ( [ e-2db ] ) and ( [ e-2da ] ) imply the value of @xmath9 .",

    "the existence of the centre does not contradict the copernican principle : all points in the _ physical _ space @xmath2 are equidistant from the centre [ according to the metric of @xmath4 , eq .",

    ", the full space here _ does not have physical meaning_. on the contrary , just as the physical space @xmath2 is only a subset of the mostly non - physical @xmath4 , there is a particular subset of @xmath5 which _ does _ have physical meaning .",
    "this subset can be referred to as a 3-hyperboloid @xmath3 , and defined in an equation uniting @xmath2 and @xmath3 by first defining the inner product @xmath52 this clearly satisfies ( in @xmath4 and in the domain of @xmath5 restricted to @xmath53 ) the properties required of an inner product that @xmath54    the 3-sphere @xmath2 and the 3-hyperboloid @xmath3 of the comoving space are then defined @xmath55 i.e. all points in the four - dimensional space of norm @xmath56 , where the norm induced by the inner product is @xmath57 but where there is again a restriction to the domain @xmath53 in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "flat 3-space is the 3-plane @xmath58 .",
    "the restriction to the domain @xmath53 for the @xmath45 case is required in order to satisfy the standard definitions of inner product , norm and metric as always non - negative . in special relativistic terminology , where @xmath59 is the time variable , these definitions are extended so that the invariant interval may be either time - like ( positive by the convention here ) or space - like ( negative here ) .    in the present case ,",
    "an extension is also needed , because although all the points of the space @xmath3 lie in the ` upper cone ' and represent ` time - like ' vectors , the small difference vectors which are of interest in integrating along this surface are in the complementary domain @xmath60 .",
    "if relativistic terminology is adopted here ( keeping in mind that the ` time ' variable @xmath59 here is purely artificial and has no physical meaning ) , then it can be said that although the invariant intervals ( vector lengths ) from the origin to the points on @xmath3 are all time - like , the difference element vectors tangent to the surface of @xmath3 are all space - like .",
