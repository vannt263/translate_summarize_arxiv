    "extreme value statistics ( evs ) has traditionally found applications in the analysis of environmental and engineering data , such as water level fluctuations or appliance lifetime  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a surge of activity from physicists in modeling phenomena that are governed by the extremal values of some random variable .",
    "examples range from the low - temperature state in spin glasses @xcite , a variety of disordered systems with traveling fronts ( see @xcite for a brief review ) , and modeling corrosive fracture @xcite , to depinning of surfaces @xcite , to relaxation in granular materials @xcite .    a central notion in evs is the existence of limit distributions , that is , the extremal value in a batch of a large number of independent , identically distributed ( i.  i.  d. ) random scalar variables obeys a probability density function ( pdf ) , which is limited to one of three main types  @xcite .",
    "it is the tail of the pdf of the original variable , the parent pdf , that determines which one of these three classes the evs will belong to .",
    "one distinguishes the fisher - tippett - gumbel ( ftg ) distribution , for a decay faster than any power law , the fisher - tippett - frchet ( ftf ) , for power tail , and weibull , for power law at a finite edge .",
    "the limit pdfs can even be cast into a single function with a parameter whose different ranges correspond to different traditional classes , see e.g.   ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the appearance of evs limit distributions in physical systems is in itself interesting and yields a new tool for the description of those systems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are instances when the quantities in question are either dependent , differently distributed , or , have several components and thus generically do not belong to any of the aforementioned evs classes , see e.g.  @xcite . closely related to our present subject are the studies on the distribution of local @xcite and global @xcite extrema of the height of surfaces . whereas there is no general mathematical theory for the evs of non - i .",
    "i.  d.  quantities , quite a few special cases have been clarified , refs .",
    "@xcite has some examples of them .",
    "a possible connection of evs to non - gaussian fluctuations of spatially averaged , or , global , quantities in critical ( strongly correlated ) systems has recently been raised  @xcite in relation to both experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite for many - body systems as well as for environmental data  @xcite .",
    "there are two striking characteristics of this ensemble of observations .",
    "firstly , the form of the pdf is similar for these observables  @xcite , and secondly , these functions bare a strong resemblance to the ftg distribution .",
    "there is some variation in form and there are some clear exceptions , but this approximate universality has been the subject of considerable debate in the literature .    more concrete connections to evs have been found in studies of the fluctuations of the roughness , or , width , of interfaces .",
    "the non - gaussian nature of these fluctuations was first discussed in  @xcite , and in  @xcite families of pdfs were identified , all characterized by a single maximum , positive skewness , an exponential , or near exponential , tail for large fluctuations above the mean , and even faster decay below it . in gaussian interface models relation to the ftg distribution",
    "has been observed in several instances .",
    "namely , the magnetization distribution of the @xmath0 xy model , in the low - temperature phase where vortices are rare , has been related to the roughness distribution in the stationary @xmath0 edwards - wilkinson interface , and strong resemblance has been found to a formal generalization of the ftg function  @xcite . in another work on the @xmath0 xy model , the ftg function was numerically observed for extremal mode selection  @xcite .",
    "a strong connection to evs comes from an analytic result on a @xmath1 interface model with long - range interactions , corresponding to a gaussian noise with @xmath2 power spectrum , where the roughness of the interface turns out to be exactly of the ftg form  @xcite .",
    "given the manifold occurrence of the ftg shape , we are led to study the relation between evs and the roughness of gaussian interface models .",
    "these models can be considered as generalizations of the stationary @xmath3-dimensional edwards - wilkinson interfaces , specified by the exponent @xmath4 in the power - law dispersion of fourier modes ( for @xmath5 the edwards - wilkinson case is recovered ) . due to their integrability",
    ", they are ideal starting point for the study of more complex , strongly fluctuating systems .",
    "as the models diagonalize into statistically independent modes , and the roughness equals the sum of the fourier intensities , it is straightforward to address the problem of possible connection to evs .",
    "namely , one can pose the question that originally motivated our research : do the modes with the largest intensities dominate the pdf of the roughness ? here",
    "we show that the answer to this question is no .",
    "in fact , this negative result , the first main conclusion of this paper , is immediately apparent once we construct the distribution of the maximal intensity , an expression that turns out to be a generalized form of the dedekind function . besides being different from the distribution of roughness",
    ", this function generically also deviates from the ftg or any known evs limit distributions .",
    "the reason for the deviation from conventional evs is that the independent modes have gapless dispersion , and are strongly non - identically distributed even for higher wavenumbers . as a result , for each realization of the interface , the largest intensity comes from one of only a few soft modes .",
    "the evs is therefore effectively coming from a finite - size system , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the main body of the paper concerns the study of the maximal intensity pdf , which is found to depend on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . while there are no finite critical @xmath6 or @xmath7 , marking thresholds to the known evs limit distributions , we discover three limits where ftg statistics sets in : ( i ) @xmath8 , ( ii ) @xmath9 , ( iii ) when only hard modes with wave vectors beyond a diverging radius @xmath10 are kept .",
    "common in these cases is that the thermodynamic limit can be taken beforehand , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of modes , so one chooses the maximal intensity out of an infinite set , in contrast to the conventional evs procedure .",
    "the extremal value pdf becomes degenerate in all three cases in the sense that the standard deviation shrinks to zero on the scale of the mean .",
    "this is similar to the traditional ftg scenario when such degeneracy appears for @xmath11 .",
    "now , however , in each case special scaling should be applied to resolve degeneracy and reveal the ftg distribution .",
    "it is suggested that the ftg limit in case ( iii ) is responsible for the numerically observed fit to the ftg function in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we turn to the question how the evs changes by considering a different choice of expansion functions ( modes ) .",
    "this study further illuminates the fact that the evs is not generically described by any of the traditional evs limit functions .",
    "since the dominant contribution to the evs comes from a few modes , the evs will depend on the specific expansion functions .",
    "we find analytically a different family of extreme value pdfs for the intensities if the interface is expanded in sines and cosines , albeit the overall shape goes close to that of the pdf of the maximal fourier intensities .",
    "we section the paper as follows . in section [ sec : d1 ]",

    "the pdf of the roughness for the gaussian model has been extensively studied in @xcite . for @xmath38",
    "it was found analytically to coincide with the ftg function @xcite , one of the limit functions of evs .",
    "nevertheless , the roughness is not _ a priori _ an extremal quantity and it remains an open question why it obeys the evs .",
    "one may argue that the sum is dominated by the softer modes whose extremal values possibly determine the cumulative behavior @xcite .",
    "motivated by this problem we study the largest contribution to the sum ( [ w2ampl ] ) .",
    "an alternative choice of fourier coefficients would be the set @xmath39 , as studied in  @xcite .",
    "these are the coefficients from the expansions by sines and cosines , and while this does not seem to be a physically significant modification , the evs for this set is , in general , quantitatively different from that of the intensities @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , the pdfs for the two sets are similar in shape and lead to the same physical conclusions , so in order to keep unity of discussion we focus on the set @xmath41 along most of the main text , and summarize the results on the @xmath42 at the end .",
    "we calculate the probability that the maximal intensity @xmath43 is @xmath44 , so we shall actually determine the scaling function of the evs .",
    "we denote the pdf for that extreme value by @xmath45 , and the cumulative , or , integrated probability distribution function ( ipdf ) by @xmath46 since @xmath47 is the probability that none of the @xmath40s exceed @xmath44 , we can express it as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the normalization constant for the pdf of the @xmath50th mode .",
    "after evaluating the integrals in ( [ ipdf ] ) we find @xmath51 in fact , for @xmath38 the product ( [ ipdf1 ] ) is known from the defining formula of dedekind s eta function , the latter also containing an extra power prefactor  @xcite . despite the difference in the prefactor , we will refer to ( [ ipdf1 ] ) as a generalized dedekind function . differentiating ( [ ipdf1 ] ) we arrive at the expression for the pdf of the maximal intensity @xmath52 the ipdf and",
    "the pdf vanish for @xmath53 , the above formulas ( [ ipdf1],[pdf1 ] ) are understood for non - negative @xmath14 .",
    "three limits are easily understood here .",
    "firstly , if @xmath54 , i.   e.  the modes are identically distributed , we find @xmath55 then the change of variables @xmath56 , with    [ eq : ag ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 is riemann s zeta function and @xmath59 euler s constant , yields the ftg distribution in the @xmath60 limit    [ allgumbel ] @xmath61    the constants in ( [ eq : ag ] ) were used to scale the ftg distribution so that the mean becomes zero and the variance one  @xcite .",
    "secondly and thirdly , in both limits @xmath62 and @xmath63 only the mode @xmath64 matters and one finds    @xmath65    already at this point we can draw one of the main conclusions of the present paper , namely , that for general @xmath4 the extreme value pdfs are none of the known evs limit functions",
    ". this immediately follows from the fact that the negative-@xmath14 and large-@xmath14 behavior of ( [ ipdf1],[pdf1 ] ) is incompatible with those of the limit functions for the statistics of maxima  @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of validity of the traditional evs limit distributions can be ascribed to the fact that , for @xmath66 , due to the @xmath67 dispersion , the distributions of the individual modes are sufficiently different . here `` sufficiently '' needs to be emphasized , because one can conceive sets of different parent pdfs for the modes  @xcite that lead to say the ftg function .",
    "such is the case of a dispersion that has a gap at the origin or goes to a constant for high frequencies .",
    "conversely , one should not be surprised by the appearance of special pdfs different from the known limit distributions , because actually for any given pdf one can choose sets of different parent distributions yielding that pdf in evs  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that for @xmath66 in formulas ( [ ipdf1],[pdf1 ] ) the limit @xmath60 can be taken and the resulting distribution has finite moments . indeed , because of dispersion the exponential pdfs of individual modes decay increasingly fast and so no singularities appear for large @xmath12 . in conventional evs ,",
    "limit distributions arise because the moments of variable @xmath14 scale in singular ways in the thermodynamic limit , thus removing most of the details of the distribution of the original random variables .",
    "now , however , there is no such singular scale and the strong dependence on the statistics of the individual modes through the parameter @xmath4 remains .",
    "this gives us a physical intuition about why the evs for intensities of interfaces with dispersion is not described by any of the traditional limit distributions .",
    "furthermore , we can also immediately assert the difference between the pdf of the roughness ( [ w2ampl ] ) , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the pdf ( [ pdf1 ] ) of the maximal intensity component in ( [ w2ampl ] ) .",
    "an obvious deviation is in the physical scales , namely , while the maximal intensity is always of order @xmath68 , the mean roughness is like that only for @xmath69 , diverges logarithmically for @xmath38 , and stays finite for finite sampling times @xmath70 if @xmath71 .",
    "even when the scaling is the same , for finite @xmath69 , the two pdfs clearly differ ( the generating function of the roughness pdf is given in  @xcite , whose laplace transform is not eq .",

    "while here we took the terms with @xmath83 as one , this gives us a first hint of the expected functional form .",
    "a more precise calculation in appendix [ sec : a ] shows that the large-@xmath50 region gives a contribution of equal order , and in the end the true asymptote differs from ( [ productapprox ] ) only in a scale factor in the exponent @xmath84 see eq .",

    "we obtain @xmath172 where @xmath173 careful consideration of the compounding logarithmic singularities leads to the observation that in terms of the variable @xmath145 , introduced by @xmath174 the expression ( [ eq : hm - lnm ] ) is just @xmath175 up to terms vanishing with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "that is , we have recovered the ftg function ( [ gumbel - ipdf ] ) @xmath176 where the linear transformation ( [ eq : hm - y ] ) is understood . comparing ( [ eq : hm - y ] ) with ( [ eq : zy ] ) we find that the mean @xmath177 has the leading singularity @xmath178 , so in the relevant region of @xmath14 the @xmath179 indeed diverges , as assumed in the above derivation .",

    "then there is an upper critical value @xmath212 , that is the threshold for the respective classical limit distribution , gaussian for the roughness and ftg for the maximal intensity . for the roughness we have seen  @xcite that @xmath213 and for the maximal intensity it is again @xmath214 .",
    "so there is a region , @xmath215 , where the roughness is gaussian , but the evs is still not given by any of the known limit distributions of evs , rather by the generalized dedekind function .",
    "there is a significant difference also in the finite - size correction to the pdf .",
    "the pdf for the extremal amplitude converges essentially exponentially fast ( see app .  [",
    "sec : fs ] for the @xmath1 correction formula ) , while the correction to the roughness pdf can be shown to be algebraic in @xmath12 .    in sum",
    ", there is a strong qualitative resemblance between the shape of the roughness pdf for @xmath15 and the evs , furthermore , their initial asymptotes have similar functional forms , they are , however , distinctly different functions .",
    "it remains to be clarified whether the similarity has some deeper reason , or it is simply a mathematical coincidence .",
    "the results presented above bring us to a very definite conclusion concerning the relation between interface fluctuations and extremal statistics : the roughness pdf is not given by the largest mode in the gaussian interface model .",
    "this is true , even in the case @xmath194 , where the roughness pdf is the ftg distribution  @xcite , one of the known limit functions of extreme statistics .",
    "we showed , further , that the pdf was none of the known evs limit distributions and depended on the statistics for the individual elements of the model .",
    "in addition , one expects the boundary conditions to influence the shape of the pdfs .",
    "it should be added that , to the extent that the gaussian model is a universal family of massless models from the viewpoint of critical phenomena , the generalized dedekind pdfs are equally universal , depending on the dimensionality @xmath3 and the dispersion parameter @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there is an analogy between the gaussian distribution arising from the central limit theorem , which applies for sums of random variables with finite moments , and the extreme value limit distributions such as ftg , which is about the maximal of those variables .",
    "both limit distributions are related to a large ensemble of independent , identically distributed objects .",
    "the appearance of a non - gaussian pdf for the integrated power spectrum ( i.e.  roughness ) , in gaussian systems @xcite , is a consequence of strong dispersion , whence follows the strongly non - identical distribution of the modes .",
    "what we have illustrated in this paper is that it is this same dispersion that generically excludes the known limit distributions of extreme statistics . to refine the picture",
    ", we found that if gaussian central limit statistics is excluded for the integrated variable because of dispersion , ftg extremal statistics is also explicitly excluded , but the reverse is not necessarily true : there is the region of finite @xmath216 , where the integrated power is gaussian but the maximal fourier intensity does not follow ftg .",
    "however , we found three border cases where , by singular scaling , the ftg distribution arises . in the limit @xmath8 the amplitudes obviously become identically distributed . for the other cases ,",
    "that is , in the limit @xmath9 and when a large number of modes are omitted near the center of the brillouin zone , the number of contributing modes diverge but the dispersion across the zone remains .",
    "this result appears to broaden the scope of validity of the ftg distribution in evs to non - i .",
    "i.  d.  variables .",
    "furthermore , the special scalings that led to the emergence of ftg in the border cases demonstrate new ways of extracting the known limit distribution even in the absence of the conventional ftg scenario .    in summary , the extreme value pdf for gaussian interface models are , for fixed choice of variables , a two - parameter family of functions with a nonanalytic part for small values , a single maximum , and an essentially exponential tail .",
    "the functions look qualitatively similar , but vary quantitatively over the range of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 studied .",
    "this family of curves is different from that found for the roughness distribution for the same parameters @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that it is not possible to make a direct link between non - gaussian roughness fluctuations and extreme values in these models .",
    "given the multitude of recent observations of non - gaussian fluctuations in experimental and in model strongly correlated systems , as well as in the use of interface models as phenomenological tools in describing such fluctuations , this seems like an important result .",
