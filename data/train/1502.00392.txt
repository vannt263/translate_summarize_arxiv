    "the outbreaks of diseases can involve the diffusion of information in regard to the diseases , including the risk of infection , rumors , fears and so on , which can stimulate individuals to take spontaneous behavioral responses to protect themselves , thereby bring profound impacts on the spreading of disease  @xcite .",
    "for example , recent outbreaks of the h1n1 flu , the bird flu , and the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) have brought the reduction of going out and the plenty of people wearing face masks .",
    "for this reason , there has been an increasing focus on the development of formal models aimed at investigating the interplay of epidemic spreading and information - based behavioral responses@xcite . such as , based on the assumption that the probability of susceptible",
    "individual going to the alter state is proportional to the number of infected neighbors , sahneh__et al . _",
    "_ extended the sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model to a susceptible - alter - infected - susceptible ( sais ) model  @xcite , and they found that the way of behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold ; meloni _ et  al . _ studied a meta - population model that incorporates several scenarios of self - initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals , and they found that such behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold , but may produce a negative impact on disease , i.e. , the density of infection is increased  @xcite ; in refs .",
    "@xcite , authors investigated the effects of the information - based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics by designing the transmission rate as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density .    though the effects of information - based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics have been studied by many authors",
    ", most of works assumed the spreadings of information and epidemic are in the same network . as we know , with the development of technology , information can fast diffuse through many different channels , such as , the word of mouth , news media , online social networks , and so on . in view of this , recent well - studied multiplex network theory has been used to mimic the interplay of information or related awareness and the epidemic dynamics@xcite . for instance , sahneh _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that the information dissemination spread in another network can help boost the resilience of the agents population against the spreading and found optimal information dissemination for different topologies  @xcite ; wang _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the interplay of the epidemic dynamics and the information dynamics in multiplex network based on the sir ( r - recovery ) model , and focused on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process : epidemic threshold and the final epidemic prevalence  @xcite ; granell _ et  al .",
    "_ established an sis - uau model to investigate the competing effects of the spreading of awareness and the epidemic dynamics in multiplex with the transmission rate of awareness as well as the structure of information network  @xcite .",
    "more recently , they further generalized their model by reducing the probability of infected individuals becoming awareness and including the effect of a mass broadcast of awareness ( mass media ) on the epidemic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "existing works either assume that individuals are self - initiated  @xcite , that is , they become aware because their neighbors are infected , or individuals can only be informed and become aware by other aware neighbors  @xcite , the combine effects of the two factors have not been well studied . in reality",
    ", individuals can obtain the disease information through many ways .",
    "inspired these factors , in the current work , we study the interplay between the diffusion of awareness by incorporating the _ self - awareness _ effects and the epidemic dynamics under the framework of multiplex network . in the model , an infectious disease",
    "first spreads among population represented by the contact network , and then the outbreak of the disease stimulates some people ( infected or susceptible individuals ) become aware of the risk of infection , and they take some protections to reduce the probability of infection . meanwhile ,",
    "unaware individuals can be informed by other aware individuals through the information network or become _ self - awareness _ induced by the infected neighbors in contact network or mass media .",
    "the finding indicates that the additional self - initiated awareness mechanism can reduce the density of infection , however , which can not alter the epidemic threshold .",
    "the results are verified by the monte - carlo simulations and the microscopic markov chain approach ( mmca ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : we introduce the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the simulation results and theoretical analysis are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : main results ] .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the results for the global information - based _ self - initiated _ awareness are given in appendix .",
    "in this work , we generalize the model of ref .  @xcite . in that model ,",
    "a multiplex includes two layers , one is physical layer representing the spreading of epidemic ( contact network ) , and the other is information layer on where the diffusion of the awareness evolves ( information network ) .",
    "all nodes represent the same individuals in both layers , but the connectivity is different in each of them . in the contact layer , a susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model",
    "is used to mimic the epidemic dynamics .",
    "that is to say , a susceptible node can be infected by one infected neighbor with certain probability , and the infected node can return to susceptible state with probability @xmath0 . on the information layer",
    ", the dynamical process of awareness is assumed to be similar to the sis model , that is , an unaware node ( u ) can be informed by an aware neighbor ( a ) with probability @xmath1 , and the aware node can loss awareness and back to unaware state with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the interplay of the two processes is modelled as follows :",
    "once an individual is infected , s / he will certainly become aware , that is , the probability is @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , to distinguish the protective behaviors between the aware individuals and unaware individuals , let @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 . if @xmath7 , the aware individuals are completely immune to the infection . )",
    "be the probabilities of unaware and aware susceptible nodes to get infected , respectively .    from the description of the model , one can find that , on the one hand , the authors assumed that the infected individuals will _ automatically _ become aware and are willing to inform the disease information .",
    "as we know , in many cases , infected individuals are unwilling to tell others since they can be discriminated or isolated by others once others know they are infected by one certain disease .",
    "so we make a progress and assume that infected individuals becoming aware with probability @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , in the model , individuals can _ only _ be informed by their neighbors through the information network , that is to say , one individual has no chance to become aware once their neighbors are unaware . however , as proposed in many previous works , individuals can become _ self - awareness _ once their friends are infected or they are informed by the mass media .",
    "thus , we further generalize the model as : a susceptible individual can go to aware state by _ self - initiated _ response with probability @xmath9 when contacting one infected friend . therefore ,",
    "the probability of the susceptible individual becoming awareness increases with the number of infected neighbors in the contact network  @xcite .",
    "note that , for the original model in ref .",
    "@xcite , awareness can not break out if the probability @xmath10 , so the roles of awareness can not be played , however , in our model , the awareness can diffuse among population even though @xmath10 since susceptible individuals can become awareness by their _ self - initiated _ responses .",

    "[ fig2 ] , one can easily write the markov chain approach ( mmca ) equations  @xcite for each state , for example , along the top branch of the four trees , one can read the probability @xmath33 of su at @xmath32 as : @xmath34    similarly , the other three mmca equations can be written as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 .",
    "when the system goes to the stationary state , we have @xmath37 for su state and",
    "equivalently for the su , sa and iu states .",
    "since the epidemic threshold determines whether the epidemic can outbreak or die out , it is vital to analyze the effects of the different parameters on the epidemic threshold @xmath38 . as stated in ref .",

    "all simulation results are obtained by averaging 20 realizations .",

    "[ fig3 ] , one can observe that the results based on the two approaches are in good agreement .",

    ", one can see that though the larger value of @xmath9 can cause more individuals become aware and reduce the density of infection .",
    "however , one can find that the increasing of @xmath1 has no influence on the epidemic threshold .",
    "the result is remarkably different from many previous results which claim that the local information - based behavioral response in the _ single - layer network _ can alter the epidemic threshold . how to understand this nontrivial result ?",
    "since the uau awareness dynamic is the same to the sis epidemic process .",
    "when the epidemic has not broken out , the density of awareness in information network ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath70 ) is only determined by the transmission rate of awareness , @xmath1 , recovery rate @xmath2 and the structure of information network , but is not related to the value of @xmath9 .",
    "namely , near or below the epidemic threshold point , increasing the value of @xmath9 only means that the initial number of the aware individuals is increased , which can not affect the density of aware individuals at stationary state . in this case , the value of @xmath71 is independent of the value of @xmath9 or @xmath13 , which gives rise to the same value of @xmath72 [ see fig .  [ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "thus , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , the epidemic threshold @xmath38 is invariable owing to the same value of @xmath70 .",
    "one should note that , for the case of single - layer network , the local information - based behavioral response can _ directly _ reduce the transmission rate of epidemic , leading to the change of the epidemic threshold . for our model , the self - awareness behavior first diffuses through the information network , and then the epidemic process happens in contact network .",
    "thus , the effect of the awareness behavior on the transmission rate is _",
    "indirect_.    the density of infected individuals and aware nodes as functions of @xmath4 for different values of parameter @xmath13 are also shown in fig .  [ fig5](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , respectively .",
    "one can see that , similar to fig .  [ 4 ] , varying the value of @xmath13 has no effect on the epidemic threshold .",
    "however , differ to the above case , from fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) we find that the value of @xmath13 also has negligible effect on the density of infection , even in the extreme cases where infected unaware individuals remain unaware of its sickness ( @xmath10 ) or certainly become aware of it ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "recognizing that , on the one hand , outbreak of an epidemic through a physical - contact network can trigger the spreading of information awareness through other different channels , such as on - line social networks , mass media ; on the other hand , an individual can not only be informed by other aware neighbors but also can become self - awareness once some friends in contact network are infected . by introducing the _ self - awareness _",

    "analysis based on the markov chain approach as well as the extensive computations reveal that the density of infection can be reduced once the two parameters are increased , however , we found that the impact of self - awareness behavior for susceptible individuals on inhibiting the spreading of epidemic is much better than the self - awareness of the infected individuals , since self - awareness from susceptible individuals can directly reduce their probabilities of being infected .",
    "meanwhile , we found that the self - awareness behavior can not alter the epidemic threshold no matter of the local or global information , which are in stark contrast with the results obtained from the single - layer networks .",

    "thus , it can be regarded as a global information - based awareness .",
    "one questionable point is that the probability of being awareness @xmath84 is irrelevant to the density of infection . as a result ,",
    "even the epidemic is almost eliminated , individuals also have the fix probability of being aware . in reality",
    ", becoming awareness often means that individuals need to take some protective measures , such as , washing hands , wearing masks or reducing outgoings .",
    "these measures indicate certain inconveniences or some cost  @xcite .",
