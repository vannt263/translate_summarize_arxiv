    "the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1ca has special interest .",
    "its strongest branch is a superallowed transition from the @xmath2 , @xmath9=1 ground state of @xmath1ca to the @xmath2 , @xmath9=1 analog state at 130-kev excitation energy in its daughter @xmath1k .",
    "such @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath2 transitions have long played an important role in yielding the most precise value for @xmath8 , the up - down quark - mixing element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which in turn enables the most demanding test of that matrix s unitarity .",
    "although the standard model does not specify values for the ckm matrix elements , it does require the matrix to be unitary .",
    "if the measured matrix elements were to lead to a failed unitarity test , then the model would be demonstrably incomplete , indicating the need for new physics .    without the @xmath1ca superallowed transition ,",
    "there are already thirteen @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath2 transitions whose @xmath6 values are known to @xmath10 0.1% precision @xcite .",
    "what is the motivation to add a fourteenth ?",
    "first , @xmath1ca decay involves states exclusively within the @xmath11 shell , where model calculations are reliable , so the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction required to extract @xmath8 can be calculated with very little uncertainty originating from nuclear - structure ambiguities .",
    "second , the calculated value for this correction to the @xmath1ca transition is larger than it is for any of the other measured transitions with isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections of similar reliability ; if it produces a result for @xmath8 that is consistent with previous values , then it serves to confirm the veracity of the corrections for all such transitions .",
    "third , the @xmath1ca@xmath3@xmath12k transition is mirror to the already well - known @xmath12k@xmath3@xmath1ar superallowed transition .",
    "the ratio of mirror @xmath6 values is very sensitive to the details of the isospin - symmetry - breaking calculation , and is therefore a critical test of these calculations @xcite . until now",
    ", no pair of mirror @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath2 transitions was known with sufficient precision to be useful in this context .",
    "the measurement reported here is the first precise measurement of the branching ratios for the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1ca .",
    "our result for the @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath2 transition and its impact on the isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections have been reported recently in letter format @xcite . here",
    "we describe the details of the experiment itself and present information on all the @xmath0-decay branches from @xmath1ca .",
    "in addition to the superallowed branch , there are five allowed gamow - teller branches to @xmath5 states in @xmath1k .",
    "their intensities will be seen to agree well with @xmath11-shell - model calculations , further confirming the efficacy of the model in this mass region .",
    "our measurement consisted of repetitive cycles , in which we deposited pure samples of @xmath1ca ( @xmath13=@xmath4444 ms ) , moved them rapidly to a shielded counting location and recorded @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidences from their decay . by measuring the absolute intensity of the @xmath14-ray peaks in the coincidence spectrum and comparing them to the total number of detected @xmath0 particles",
    ", we could derive the branching ratios for the @xmath0 transitions that populated the @xmath14-emitting states in @xmath1k .",
    "we produced @xmath1ca via the @xmath15(@xmath16k , 2@xmath17)@xmath1ca reaction using a 30@xmath18-mev @xmath16k primary beam from the k500 superconducting cyclotron at texas a&m university .",
    "the target was liquid - nitrogen - cooled hydrogen contained at 2.0 atm pressure in a gas cell located in the target chamber of the momentum achromat recoil spectrometer ( mars ) @xcite .",
    "the fully stripped reaction ejectiles were spatially separated by their charge - to - mass ratio , @xmath19 , in mars , leaving a nearly pure @xmath1ca beam to emerge from the focal - plane extraction slits .",
    "this beam then exited the vacuum system through a 51-@xmath20m - thick kapton window , passed through a 0.3-mm - thick bc-404 scintillator , and then through a stack of aluminum degraders , finally stopping in the 76-@xmath20m - thick aluminized mylar tape of a fast tape - transport system .    to optimize beam purity",
    "before the measurement began , we inserted a 1-mm - thick 16-strip position - sensitive silicon detector ( pssd ) at the mars focal plane .",
    "then , working with a low - current primary beam we focused the @xmath1ca beam , and also identified and minimized nearby reaction products that could reduce the purity of the beam .",
    "the result we obtained after this initial tuning is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . with",
    "the focal - plane acceptance slits set as indicated in the figure , the residual impurities were very weak , with the most prominent among them being @xmath21ar and @xmath22ar .",
    "being of comparable mass to @xmath1ca , these impurities passed through the degraders and , like @xmath1ca , were stopped in the tape .",
    "lighter - mass impurities , which are not shown in the figure , have substantially longer ranges and consequently were not stopped in the mylar tape ; so they played no role in the measurement .",
    "ultimately , the sample collected in the tape was 99.7% pure @xmath1ca .    during our measurement",
    ", we checked the composition of the beam daily by re - inserting the pssd at the mars focal plane , and recording the spectrum of deposited energy versus position each time .",
    "no appreciable changes were observed throughout the experiment .",
    "all these spectra were saved and used in a detailed off - line analysis of impurities .",
    "once the beam - tuning procedures had been completed , the pssd was removed from the beam path and the primary beam intensity was increased .",
    "the data - taking was in repetitive cycles .",
    "first , @xmath1ca was collected in the tape for 1.6 s , its rate of accumulation being measured by the bc-404 scintillator located at the exit of mars . then the beam was interrupted and the tape moved the sample in 200 ms to a shielded counting location 90 cm away , where decay data were acquired for 1.54 s. after counting was complete , the beam was restored and the cycle repeated .",
    "this computer - controlled cycle , @xmath23-@xmath24-@xmath25 , was repeated over 60,000 times to obtain the desired statistics .    at the counting location , a 1-mm thick bc-404 scintillator for the detection of @xmath26 particles",
    "was located 3 mm from one side of the collection tape , and our specially calibrated high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detector for @xmath14 rays was 151 mm away from the other side of the tape .",
    "the distance between the stopped tape and the hpge detector was measured during the counting period of each cycle with a laser - ranging device @xcite mounted next to the hpge detector .",
    "the result , which was accurate to @xmath75 @xmath20 m , was recorded with the data for that cycle .",
    "the measured distances were quite consistent , with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of their distribution being 0.5 mm .",
    "since our hpge - detector efficiency has been precisely calibrated at a source - detector distance of exactly 151.0 mm , we used the laser result to adjust the calibrated detector efficiency to correspond with the actual average source - detector distance .",
    "the latter was within 0.1 mm of 151.0 mm , so the adjustment was very small .     the deposited energy versus position as obtained with the pssd in the mars focal plane .",
    "the spectrometer had already been optimized for @xmath1ca production .",
    "vertical lines show the position of the extraction slits in mars during these measurements ; note that the slits were set asymmetrically in order to minimize the contribution from impurities . ]    during the measurement , our data - acquisition system generated a `` master trigger '' by identifying the arrival of a @xmath0 particle and a @xmath14 ray within @xmath102 @xmath20s of one another .",
    "this signaled the occurrence of a @xmath0-@xmath14 coincident event and initiated acquisition .",
    "for each such event , we recorded the detected energy of both the @xmath0 and @xmath14 rays , the exact time difference between their arrivals , and the time that the event itself occurred relative to the beginning of the counting period . for each cycle we also recorded the rate of accumulation of @xmath1ca ions in the tape as a function of time , the total number of @xmath0- and @xmath14-ray singles , and the laser distance readings .",
    "the same discriminator signals used to scale the @xmath0 singles were also used in creating the master triggers and establishing the occurrence of @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidences .",
    "electronic dead times for the coincidence channel and the two singles channels were measured continuously throughout the measurement with pulser signals from a constant - frequency pulse generator being recorded in coincidence with the gating signals from each channel .",
    "room background was measured during the experiment to examine its contribution both to the @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidence spectrum and to the @xmath0-singles rate .",
    "we did this by using measurement cycles that were normal in every way except that the tape motion was disabled , so that the collected sample never reached the counting location . under these conditions , essentially no @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidences",
    "were observed , and the @xmath0-singles rate dropped to 0.014% of the rate observed under normal conditions .",
    "though very low , this room - background rate for @xmath0-singles was incorporated into our analysis .",
    "immediately after the @xmath1ca branching - ratio measurement concluded , we made an off - line measurement using a 19-kbq uncovered @xmath27na source placed at the tape position in the counting location .",
    "except that the beam was off and the tape stationary , the configuration was identical to that used in the @xmath1ca measurement .",
    "the @xmath27na source was chosen because it is a positron emitter , which populates only a single @xmath14-emitting state at 1275 kev in the daughter .",
    "consequently it provides a clean view of the compton - scattering distribution from 511-kev photons in the region around 328 kev , the energy of one of the @xmath14-ray peaks from @xmath1ca decay .",
    "this information was invaluable to us in extracting the area of the 328-kev peak , since that peak lies just at the edge of the compton distribution .",
    "a simplified @xmath0-decay scheme for @xmath1ca is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , from which it can be seen that the superallowed transition directly feeds the 130-kev isomer in @xmath1k .",
    "this state has a half - life of 924 ms , so no prompt @xmath14 ray is emitted following its population .",
    "in contrast , all the allowed gamow - teller transitions to higher excited @xmath5 states are followed by prompt @xmath14 rays , predominantly emitted in each case directly to the isomeric state .",
    "it is these latter transitions whose absolute intensity we can measure from the @xmath0-coincident @xmath14-ray spectrum .",
    "the fact that the observed transitions only account for a relatively small percentage , @xmath1023% , of the total decay , actually works to our advantage .",
    "since we obtain the superallowed branching ratio by subtracting the total of the gamow - teller branching ratios from 100% , the relative uncertainty of the result is reduced by a multiplicative factor of 0.3 ( = 23/77 ) compared to that of the sum of the measured gamow - teller branches .",
    "a measurement precision of @xmath70.6% for the gamow - teller branches leads to a @xmath70.2% result for the superallowed branch .",
    "beta - decay scheme of @xmath1ca showing the four strongest @xmath0 branches and the most intense subsequent @xmath14-ray transitions in @xmath1k . for each level ,",
    "its ( j@xmath28 , t ) is given as well as its energy , expressed in kev , relative to the @xmath1k ground state @xcite .",
    "branching percentages come from this measurement . as discussed later in sec .",
    "[ ss : relgamma ] , there are other weak @xmath14 rays present , which complicate this scheme somewhat .",
    "note that there is also a very weak ( 0.03% ) @xmath14-ray branch from the 130-kev isomer to the ground state @xcite . ]    to determine the branching ratio for the superallowed transition from @xmath1ca precisely , our first step was to establish the @xmath0-branching ratio to the 1@xmath29 state in @xmath1k at 1698 kev , the most intense branch observed .",
    "we accomplished this by obtaining the number of @xmath0-coincident 1567-kev @xmath14 rays relative to the total number of positrons emitted from @xmath1ca .",
    "then , combining the relative intensities of all the other ( weaker ) observed @xmath14-ray peaks , we determined the total gamow - teller @xmath0-branching to all 1@xmath29 states . finally , the subtraction of this total from 100% resulted in the branching ratio for the superallowed transition .    to be more specific about our first step , we write the @xmath30-branching ratio , @xmath31 , for a pure @xmath30-transition populating the particular state @xmath32 , which is de - excited by the emission of a single @xmath14 ray , @xmath33 , as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidences in the @xmath33 peak ; @xmath36 is the total number of beta singles corresponding to @xmath1ca @xmath0 decay ; @xmath37 is the efficiency of the hpge detector for detecting @xmath33 rays ; @xmath38 is the efficiency of the plastic scintillator for detecting the betas that populate state @xmath32 ; and @xmath39 is the average efficiency for detecting the betas from all @xmath1ca transitions .",
    "note that this equation applies only to positron emission .",
    "although the contribution from electron capture for @xmath18=38 is very small , it must be accounted for .",
    "furthermore , small corrections must be applied to incorporate the effects of observed weak @xmath14 transitions between the states in @xmath1k .",
    "both these adjustments will be dealt with in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] .    in the immediately following sections , after describing some initial processing of the experimental data , we detail how all the factors on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : branchingratio ] ) were obtained specifically for the @xmath0 transition to the 1698-kev state .      before analysis began , we filtered our accumulated data by rejecting cycles that did not meet certain criteria .",
    "the first criterion we applied was the number of implanted @xmath1ca ions detected by the bc404 scintillator at the exit of mars during each collection period .",
    "we accepted only those cycles in which the collection rate lay between 4200 and 24,000ca ions into the tape .",
    "in fact , the average rate was 15,000 ions / s for the cycles used in our final analysis .",
    "] ions / s .",
    "this removed cycles that had very little  or no  primary beam from the cyclotron , as well as those with abnormally high beam current , which could have adversely affected our system dead time .",
    "our second criterion was based on the ratio of the number of @xmath0-particles detected to the number of @xmath1ca ions implanted for each cycle .",
    "we set limits on this ratio to reject cycles in which the tape - transport system had not moved the sample into the designated counting position between the @xmath0 detector and the hpge detector , thus significantly reducing the counting rate for @xmath0 particles ( though not appreciably reducing the singles @xmath14-ray rate ) .",
    "a third criterion could have been applied : the reading from our laser measurement of the distance between the tape and the hpge detector .",
    "however , we found that once the second criterion had been applied , these distance measurements were symmetrically distributed within a narrow range ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] ) , so no additional filtering was necessary .    in the end ,",
    "our selection criteria provided 60,847 good cycles , @xmath1089% of the total cycles recorded .",
    "these good cycles contained approximately 8.8 million @xmath0-@xmath14 coincidences , corresponding to over @xmath40 @xmath0 singles .",
    "all subsequent analysis incorporates only the data from these cycles .",
    "( a ) spectrum of measured time - differences between the arrival of a @xmath14 ray and that of a @xmath0 particle for all identified coincidence events .",
    "note that the @xmath0 signal was electronically delayed so that the prompt - coincidence peak appears near the center of the spectrum .",
    "( b ) measured time - difference spectrum for events corresponding only to the 1567-kev @xmath14 ray . ]      for each event , we recorded the time between the detection of a @xmath14-ray and the subsequent arrival of an electronically delayed signal from the positron detector , as measured with a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) .",
    "this time spectrum for all events identified by our master trigger appears in the top panel of fig .",
    "the broad peak corresponds to real ( @xmath41 `` prompt '' ) coincident events , while the flat distributions to the left and right are from random coincidences .",
    "the single - channel peak at zero is an artifact resulting from the way in which we establish the master trigger : it contains only random coincidences , their number being proportional to the time - width of the @xmath0 signal we used to establish the existence of a coincidence .",
    "spectrum of @xmath14 rays observed in prompt coincidence with positrons from the decay of @xmath1ca .",
    "the small peak labeled  511 + 171 \" is the sum of two annihilation photons , one of which has backscattered into the detector .",
    "the  511 + 1567 \" peak is the result of coincidence summing between a 1567-kev @xmath14 ray and annihilation radiation from the positron decay that preceded it . ]    an interesting curiosity , not often seen in coincidence time spectra , is the difference in the random - coincidence rates before and after the prompt peak .",
    "this is clearly visible in our measurement because of the high , @xmath1040% , efficiency of our @xmath0 detector .",
    "since this percentage of the total @xmath14-ray signals were removed by the occurrence of a prompt coincidence , the rate after the prompt peak is only 60% of the rate before .",
    "based on this time spectrum , we could easily produce a @xmath14-ray spectrum free of random - coincidence events .",
    "we did this by first gating on the part of the time spectrum that contains the prompt peak and then gating on the flat , random parts of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath14-ray spectrum obtained from the second gate , suitably normalized , was then subtracted from the spectrum from the first gate .",
    "the resultant spectrum appears in fig .",
    "it exhibits four clear @xmath14-ray peaks , at 328 kev , 1567 kev , 3211 kev , and 3848 kev , as well as several coincidence summing peaks , all of which are related to the decay of @xmath1ca .",
    "no other peaks are immediately visible .",
    "the prompt peak appearing in the top panel of fig .  [ fig3 ] has a noticeable tail to the left .",
    "this occurs because it includes all coincident events , which means the full range of detected @xmath14-ray energies is represented ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "low - energy @xmath14 rays trigger the tdc later than higher energy ones , and a later @xmath14-ray trigger results in a shorter time before the corresponding @xmath0-particle arrives : hence the tail to shorter times .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the time spectrum corresponding to a single @xmath14-ray peak , the one at 1567 kev .",
    "the prompt peak in this case is much narrower ( fwhm @xmath4210 ns ) and has no tail .",
    "it is spectra like this , each restricted to a narrow energy window around a single @xmath14-ray peak , that we used in our final analyses for the contents of individual peaks .      from the appearance of @xmath37 and the ratio @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : branchingratio ] ) it is clear that our determination of the superallowed branching ratio must rely on a precise absolute efficiency calibration of the @xmath14-ray detector , and a reasonable knowledge of relative efficiencies for the @xmath0 detector .",
    "our hpge detector has been meticulously calibrated at a source - to - detector distance of 151 mm .",
    "this was reported thoroughly a decade ago @xcite .",
    "originally we covered the energy range from 22 to 1836 kev , taking data from 13 individual sources of 10 different radionuclides : @xmath44cr , @xmath45co , @xmath46y , @xmath47ag , @xmath48cd , @xmath49sb , @xmath50ba , @xmath51cs , @xmath52cs and @xmath53hf @xcite .",
    "of crucial importance were two @xmath45co sources specially prepared by the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt @xcite , with activities certified to @xmath70.06% .",
    "these sources were used to anchor our absolute efficiency calibration , with cascaded @xmath14-ray transitions from the other sources providing precise links over a wide range of energies . at the time , in addition to acquiring calibration spectra , we also made a number of measurements designed to reveal the physical dimensions and location of the detector s ge crystal in its housing .",
    "this information was then used as input to monte carlo calculations performed with the electron and photon transport code cyltran @xcite . with only the thicknesses of the detector s two dead layers as adjustable parameters we achieved excellent agreement ( @xmath54 ) between the monte carlo efficiency results and our 40 measured data points .",
    "a year later , using @xmath55na , @xmath56co and @xmath57ga sources we extended our region of calibration up to 3.5 mev @xcite .",
    "ever since these calibrations were made , we have kept the detector continuously at liquid - nitrogen temperature to ensure that the internal dead layer did not expand .",
    "we have also periodically re - measured one of the precisely calibrated @xmath45co sources . some slight",
    "tailing has appeared on the @xmath45co peaks but , if these tails are included in the peak area , no change in detector efficiency can be detected . as a result , we can continue to use cyltran calculations to obtain our detector efficiency with @xmath70.2% uncertainty in the range 50 - 1800 kev , and with @xmath70.4% from 1800 to 3500 kev .",
    "the efficiencies obtained for the four main @xmath14-rays of interest are listed in the third column of table  [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "note that the weakest @xmath14 ray of the four , at 3848 kev , lies slightly above the range of calibration , so its efficiency carries a somewhat larger uncertainty .",
    "the peak is so weak , however , that its efficiency uncertainty is completely swamped by its statistical uncertainty .",
    ".[table1 ] detector efficiencies are given for the @xmath14 rays , @xmath33 , that de - excite states @xmath58 in @xmath1k ; and for @xmath0 particles emitted in the decay branches , @xmath59 , that populate states @xmath58 .",
    "the values for @xmath37 apply to our hpge detector , and the ratios , @xmath43 , to our thin @xmath0 scintillator .",
