    "2012 ) is an innovative quasi - meridian reflecting schmidt telescope capable of simultaneously recording spectra of up to 4,000 objects in a large field of view ( fov ) of 5  in diameter .",
    "the telescope is equipped with 16 low - resolution spectrographs , 32 ccds and 4,000 fibres .",
    "each spectrograph is fed with the light from 250 fibres and covering a wavelength range 3700 ",

    "the telescope is located in xinglong station and operated by the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) . following a two - year period of commissioning initiated in september 2009 that solved the problem of auto - positioning of the 4,000 fibres and a year long pilot surveys ( luo et al .",
    "2012 ) from october 2011  june 2012 to test and verify the designs and scientific goals of the various components of the surveys , the lamost regular surveys began in october 2012 .",
    "the lamost regular surveys consist of two parts ( zhao et al .",
    "2012 ) : the lamost extragalactic survey ( legas ) and the lamost experiment for galactic understanding and exploration ( legue ; deng et al .",
    "the legue has three components : the spheroid , the anti - centre and the disc surveys , each focusing on a distinct component of the galaxy and having different survey footprints and target selection algorithms .",
    "the spheroid survey plans to observe at least 2.5 million stars in the galactic caps ( @xmath12 ) , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 mag ( to 18.5 mag for limited fields ) , with targets selected from the fourth united states naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac4 ; zacharias et al .",

    "the disc survey ( chen et al . 2012 ) plans to cover as much area of low galactic latitudes ( @xmath14 ) as visible from xinglong station and allowed by the available observing time , focusing on open clusters and selected star - forming regions in the galactic ( thin ) disk .",
    "the targets are selected from a combination of the ucac4 , ps1 and the two micro all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) catalogues , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 mag ( to 18.5 mag for limited fields ) .    as a major component of the legue , the lamost spectroscopic survey of the galactic anti - centre ( lss - gac ; liu et al .",
    "2014 ) aims to collect spectra for a statistically complete sample of @xmath5 million stars of all colours down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 mag ( to 18.5 mag for limited fields ) , distributed in a large and continuous sky area of over 3,400 deg@xmath0 centred on the galactic anti - centre ( @xmath1 , @xmath15 ) and covering a significant volume of the galactic thin / thick discs and halo . of the legue survey footprints ,",
    "the area of galactic anti - centre is particularly interesting for several reasons : 1 ) disk is the defining component of a giant spiral galaxy like our own milky way in terms of stellar mass , angular momentum and star formation activities .",

    "are targeted using observing time of non - ideal conditions , including bright / grey lunar nights .",
    "the vb survey is supplementary to the lss - gac main survey in the sense that it has a much larger sky coverage but brighter magnitude limit and uses a simpler target selection algorithm .",
    "the vb survey thus yields an excellent sample of the local stars to probe the solar neighbourhood . a concise description of the scientific motivations , survey design and target selection , observations and data reduction and preliminary scientific results of lss - gac has been previously presented in liu et al .",

    "there are several constraints needed to be considered when designing the lss - gac survey : 1 ) for the desired limiting magnitude , there are over 10,000 stars per deg@xmath0 on the disc and about 3,000 stars per deg@xmath0 at 30@xmath28 above / below the disc within the lss - gac footprint ( figs.[footprint ] and [ r18.5 ] ) , too many to survey for a reasonable survey lifetime , say 5 years , even with 4,000 fibres offered by the lamost , six times more than available to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) ; 2 ) the spatial distribution of stars is highly non - uniform , and this is further compounded by the relatively high interstellar extinction in this region ; 3 ) as a fully developed grand - design spiral , the galaxy , in particular its disk , consists of extremely complex and varying stellar populations ; 4 ) the fov of lamost plates must be centred on stars brighter than @xmath29mag for the active optics to work so as to bring the individual segments of the primary and corrector mirrors into focus .",
    "stars of such brightness are relatively rare and not uniformly distributed on the sky ; 5 ) the lamost has a circular fov , 5deg in diameter , so field overlapping can not be avoided in order to make a contiguous sky coverage ; and 6 ) except for a few holes occupied by the four guiding cameras and the central shack - hartmann sensor , the 4,000 fibres of lamost , each controlled by two motors and patrolling a sky area of @xmath30arcmin in diameter around its parking position , are more or less uniformly distributed on the focal plane . given these constraints , a simple yet non - trivial target selection algorithm and sophisticated survey strategy",
    "must be developed in order to achieve the defining scientific goals of lss - gac .",
    "lss - gac targets are selected from the xstps - gac photometric catalogues ( liu et al .",
    "2014 ; zhang et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ; yuan et al . in prep .",
    "the basic idea of lss - gac target selection is to uniformly and randomly select stars from the colour - magnitude diagrams using a monte carlo method .",
    "it has the advantages that : 1 ) it has a well defined selection function , such that whatever class of objects ( e.g. white dwarfs , white - dwarf - main - sequence binaries , extremely metal - poor or hyper - velocity stars ) are revealed by spectroscopic observations , they can be studied in a statistically meaningful way in terms of the underlying stellar populations for the survey volume , after various selection effects have been properly taken into account ; 2 ) stars of all colours ( spectral types ) and magnitudes ( distances ) are selected in large numbers as much and as evenly as possible ; 3 ) rare objects of extreme colours are first selected and targeted with high priorities , thus vastly increasing the discovery space of the survey .",
    "based on the actual measured performance of lamost , the scientific goals and data quality requirements of lss - gac , the bright and faint limiting magnitudes of the main survey of lss - gac have been set at 14.0 and @xmath7 17.8mag in @xmath6-band , respectively . for a small number of selected fields , the limiting magnitude are set at 18.5mag . to make efficient use of observing time of different qualities and avoid fibre cross - talking , three categories of spectroscopic plates are designated , bright ( b ) , medium - bright ( m ) and faint ( f ) , targeting sources of brightness 14.0mag@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33mag , respectively . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the border magnitudes separating b , m and f plates ( discussed later ) . above the galactic plane ( @xmath36 @xmath9 3.5@xmath37 )",
    ", @xmath38 stars will be surveyed per deg@xmath0 , i.e. about five plates on average ( 2b , 2 m and 1f ) will be allocated for a given patch of sky . on the galactic plane ( @xmath36 @xmath39 3.5@xmath37 ) ,",
    "the sampling is doubled and about ten plates ( 4b , 4 m , 2f ) will be allocated for a given patch of sky . given the limited amount of observing time of exceptional quality that is needed to achieve the depth of f plates , only a finite number of designed f plates are expected to get observed during the five - year survey lifetime .",
    "targets of all designed plates are selected , assigned and checked in advance .",
    "based on the above principles , there are five steps in the lss - gac survey design and target selection .",
    "firstly , a clean sample of targets is generated from the xstps - gac catalogues .",
    "secondly , targets are assigned with different priorities and fed to the lamost survey strategy system ( sss ; yuan et al .",
    "2008 ) , which allocates fibres to targets for each designed plate scheduled for observation .",
    "thirdly , field centres of all designed plates , which have to be on a star brighter than @xmath40mag , are carefully selected and adjusted to maximize the spatial uniformity of sampling over the whole survey area .",
    "fourthly , for each chosen centre of fov , the sss is run to assign targets ( along with sky fibres ) for all designed plates .",
    "the designed plates are then ready for observational scheduling .",
    "finally , to account for the field rotation of lamost , prior to the actually execution of scheduled observations ( typically in a week ) , the sss has to be rerun and fibres re - assigned for targets of each designed plate .",
    "a small fraction of targets , less than @xmath41 ( excluding sky fibres ) , fail to get reallocated a fibre and thus will not get observed .",
    "the xstps - gac ( liu et al . 2014 ) surveys in sdss @xmath20 , @xmath6 and @xmath42 bands an area of approximately 5,400deg@xmath0 centred on the gac , from @xmath43 to 9@xmath44 and @xmath45 to + 60@xmath46 , plus an extension of @xmath47deg@xmath0 to the m31 , m33 region , with the xuyi 1.04/1.20 m schmidt telescope equipped with a 4k@xmath484k ccd .",
    "the resulting catalogues archive about a hundred millions stars down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath49mag ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the catalogues are astrometrically calibrated using the ppmxl ( roeser et al .",
    "2010 ) as reference and globally flux - calibrated ( using the ubercal algorithm , padmanabhan et al .",
    "2008 ) against the sdss dr8 ( aihara et al .",
    "2011 ) using the overlapping fields .",
    "the calibration has achieved an astrometric accuracy of 0.1arcsec ( zhang et al .",
    "2014 ) and a global photometric accuracy of 2 per cent ( yuan et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the catalogues are used to generate a clean sample of targets for the lss - gac , with the requirements that : 1 ) the stars are detected in at least two bands , including @xmath6 band , and have magnitudes @xmath51mag ; 2 ) positions of stars measured in different bands agree within 0.5 arcsec ; 3 ) they are not flagged as galaxies nor star pairs in either @xmath6 or @xmath42 band ; 4 ) they have no neighbors within 5 arcsec that are brighter than ( @xmath52 + 1 ) mag .",

    "a reddening map for the same region that shows values of @xmath16  of the interstellar extinction from sfd is shown in fig.[sfd ] .",
    "the dusty galactic disc is clearly visible , and exhibits number densities over 10,000 stars perdeg@xmath0 after imposing the above cuts .",
    "the stellar number densities decrease rapidly toward high galactic latitudes , down to about 3,000 per deg@xmath0 at @xmath53 . patchy or filamentary dark lanes or bands caused by obscuration of dark clouds are abundant . in the direction of gac ,",
    "more dark clouds are found in the southern galactic hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere , as can be clearly seen in fig.[sfd ] .",
    "there are a few roughly rectangle regions in fig.[r18.5 ] around longitude @xmath54 and latitude @xmath55 , with a total area of about 30deg@xmath0 , that have fewer stars than their surroundings due to the shallower limiting magnitudes caused by poor observing conditions when those regions were observed .",

    "the lamost active optics works well under such small separations . to maximize the uniformity of spatial sampling over the whole lss - gac survey area and achieve the designed sampling density , three groups ( g1 , g2 and g3 hereafter ) of fields",

    "there are 5 , 4 and 6 common stars shared by g1 and g2 , g1 and g3 , and g2 and g3 fields , respectively .",
    "since the lamost fov is circular , field overlapping can not be avoided in order to achieve a contiguous sky coverage . in the ideal cases",
    "where the centres of partition fall on qualified bright stars , the fraction of overlapping areas is about 20 per cent for g1 and g2 fields , and more for g3 fields .",
    "there are two options to make use of the overlapping areas of adjacent fields .",
    "one is to increase the sampling density in the overlapping regions by observing different targets in different plates .",
    "the other is to make duplicate observations for some sources in the overlapping areas for time - domain spectroscopy .",
    "the latter is preferred considering that a ) the sampling density is already high and the margin gained by increasing the sampling density is not huge ; b ) the sampling density will be more uniform over the whole survey footprint ; and most important of all , c ) it opens up the possibility of time - domain spectroscopy that may lead to new discoveries ( e.g. , yang et al . 2014 ) .",
    "to implement such an approach , we require that there are no common targets amongst plates of different groups of fields , but plates belonging to the same group , target selections of overlapping plates are independent , i.e. fibres are assigned to stars regardless whether the stars have been assigned a fibre or not in the adjacent plates .",
    "the procedure guarantees that adjacent plates belonging to the same group target , with few exceptions , the same sources in their overlapping areas .",

    "pipeline has also been been developed at peking university to flux - calibrate plates collected for the lss - gac using an iterative approach ( xiang et al .",

    "typically 320 sky fibres are allocated per plate for sky background measurements .",
    "this gives 20 sky fibres per spectrograph , or about 16 sky fibres per deg@xmath0 , which is about 3.5 times denser than the sdss .",
    "in addition to the input catalogues , to run the sss , an observing date has to be specified and the date when the field passes the prime meridian at midnight is chosen . in running the sss ,",
    "four guiding stars are first selected from the gsc2.3 catalogues to allow for corrections of fibre positioning errors produced by the expansion / contraction ( due to changes of the focal length ) , shift and rotation of the focal plane .",
    "if four guiding stars can not be located , the field centre is shifted to the nearest qualified bright star .",

    "2008 ) , candidates of young stellar objects and white dwarfs can be added_ad hoc _ to the input target catalogues , and assigned the highest priorities .",
    "this ensures that adding those special targets will not jeopardize the overall spatial uniformity of the lss - gac targets .",
    "ideally , a lamost plate should make full use of all the 4,000 fibres , with 320 of them targeting blank sky and the remaining targeting science objects . in reality ,",
    "only 3700  3930 fibres per plate are assigned a target ( including blank sky ) for most plates designed for the lss - gac main survey .",
    "the unassigned fibres are either dead or have no targets left in their reachable areas .",
    "finally the sss has to be rerun in order to update the fibre allocation prior to the actual observation taking place ( usually within a week ) , based on the output target list ( including blank sky ) generating by the first run of the sss .",
    "this is because the difference between the date specified when the sss is first run and the actual observing date can lead to loss or change of guiding stars originally selected . in most cases ,",
    "no loss or change of guiding stars occurs , and most targets assigned a fibre in the first round of runs of sss get re - assigned a fibre",
    ". only a few , if not nil targets , fail to get reallocation of a fibre .",
    "the occasional loss of a small number of targets is caused by the small differences in aberration corrections for fibre positions at different dates .",
    "this ensures that all lss - gac plates can be designed , targets assigned and checked well in advance of actual observation . in some rare cases , one or two of the selected guiding stars get changed .",
    "the change of one guiding star can lead to a loss of 200  300 targets originally assigned a fibre .",
    "if two guiding stars are changed , about 500  600 original targets can get lost .",
    "this problem has however been fully solved since november , 2013 by supplying the sss when it is rerun lists of guiding stars that contain only those selected in the first run of sss , instead of the whole gsc2.3 catalogues .",

    "the evolution and properties , including luminosity , of a ( single ) star are fully determined by its initial mass , chemical composition and age . for",
    "a given set of initial mass and chemical composition , the stellar evolutionary models of structure and atmosphere yield , log  @xmath20 , [ fe / h ]  and absolute magnitudes of specified photometric bands as a function of age .",
    "the absolute magnitudes have a tight relation with , log  @xmath20  and [ fe / h ] .",
    "therefore , it is possible to estimate absolute magnitudes , thus distances , from the values of , log  @xmath20  and [ fe / h ]   yielded by spectroscopy when combined with reddening corrected photometry of apparent magnitudes .",
    "note that [ fe / h ]  is often used as a proxy of the chemical composition , the effects of possible variations in individual elemental abundances , such as the @xmath21-element enhancement have been neglected . for stars in the miles library ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes can be directly calculated using the hipparcos parallaxes ( anderson & francis 2012 ) .",
    "together with the atmospheric parameters , the stars thus provide an excellent sample to establish empirical relations between the absolute magnitudes and , log  @xmath20  and [ fe / h ] , enabling us to determine distances from , log  @xmath20  and [ fe / h ]  directly .",
    "compared to the theoretical relations from the stellar evolutionary models , the approach has the advantage of being model - independent and straight - forward to use .",
    "considering that the atmospheric parameters of lss - gac targets are derived by template matching with the miles library , it is quite natural to apply the empirical relations of absolute magnitudes as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters as derived from the miles stars to the lss - gac targets .",
    "we use polynomials to construct the empirical relations between the absolute magnitudes in @xmath168 and @xmath155 bands and , log  @xmath20  and [ fe / h ]  for the miles stars .",
    "the apparent magnitudes in @xmath20 and @xmath6 bands of the stars are transformed from the observed , dereddened @xmath169 and @xmath170 magnitudes using relations , @xmath171mag and @xmath172mag ( jester et al . 2005 ) .",
    "errors of the derived absolute magnitudes are estimated by combining the photometric and distance ( parallax ) errors . when fitting the data , we only include those miles stars whose estimated errors of absolute magnitudes are smaller than 0.4mag , and weight the remaining data points by the inverse square of the absolute magnitude errors .",
    "a @xmath173 clipping is used to exclude outliers .",
    "the miles library includes stars of a wide range of spectral types and luminosity classes , from the o to the m and from dwarfs to giants .",
    "fitting all the stars with a single polynomial will require a very high order polynomial .",
    "the result is also likely to be unstable and liable to large errors near the periphery of parameter space coverage . to solve the problem",
    ", we divide the stars into four groups of spectral type and luminosity class 1 ) the hot oba stars ; 2 ) fgk dwarfs ; 3 ) km dwarfs and 4 ) gkm giants .",
    "each group is fitted independently .",
    "the groups are defined in atmospheric parameter space with some overlapping .",
    "the definitions are :    oba stars : : :    @xmath174  k ; fgk dwarfs : : :    @xmath175  k ,    log  @xmath20  @xmath176 3.2 ( cms@xmath177 ) ; km dwarfs : : :    @xmath178  k ,    log  @xmath20  @xmath176 3.2 ( cms@xmath177 ) ; gkm giants : : :    @xmath179  k ,    log  @xmath20  @xmath39 3.5 ( cms@xmath177 ) .    a three - order polynomial of the following form",

    "the residuals are partly contributed by errors of the absolute magnitudes as calculated from the apparent magnitudes and hipparcos parallaxes .    as a robustness check of the relations derived above ,",
    "we apply them to selected stars in the pastel database to derive the absolute magnitudes and compare the results with those calculated from the hipparcos distances .",

    "the differences between the two sets of estimates have an average dispersion of about 0.34 , 0.25 and 0.25 mag for the groups of oba stars , fgk dwarfs and km dwarfs , respectively , comparable to the fit residuals of the miles stars .",
    "the results suggest that the fits are robust and applicable to most types of stars , especially the dwarfs .",
    "there are , however , some small systematic differences between the two sets of estimates of absolute magnitudes for the selected pastel stars , on the level of 0.09 , 0.12 and 0.20 mag for the groups of oba stars , fgk dwarfs and km dwarfs , respectively . for gkm giants ,",

    "in addition , the average absolute magnitudes calculated from the fitted relations are systematically larger by 0.48 mag than the ones calculated from the measured parallaxes .",

    "<S> as a major component of the lamost galactic surveys , the lamost spectroscopic survey of the galactic anti - centre ( lss - gac ) aims to survey a significant volume of the galactic thin / thick discs and halo for a contiguous sky area of over 3,400 deg@xmath0 centred on the galactic anti - centre ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , and obtain @xmath33700  9000 low resolution ( @xmath4 ) spectra for a statistically complete sample of @xmath5 m stars of all colours down to a limiting magnitued of @xmath6 @xmath7 17.8mag ( to 18.5mag for limited fields ) . together with gaia , the lss - gac will yield a unique dataset to advance our understanding of the structure and assemblage history of the galaxy , in particular its disk(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the main survey , the lss - gac will also target hundreds of thousands objects in the vicinity fields of m31 and m33 and survey a significant fraction ( over a million ) of randomly selected very bright stars ( vb ; @xmath8 mag ) in the northern hemisphere . during the pilot and the first year regular surveys of lamost , </S>",
    "<S> a total of 1,042,586 [ 750,867 ] spectra of a signal to noise ratio s / n(7450 ) @xmath9 10 [ s / n(4650 ) @xmath9 10 ] have been collected . in this paper , we present a detailed description of the target selection algorithm , survey design , observations and the first data release of value - added catalogues ( including radial velocities , effective temperatures , surface gravities , metallicities , values of interstellar extinction , distances , proper motions and orbital parameters ) of the lss - gac .    </S>",
