    "recently , the lowest - lying octet baryon masses have been studied on the lattice with @xmath0 configurations  @xcite . because the limitation of the computational resources , most lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) simulations still have to employ larger than physical light - quark masses , finite lattice volume and finite lattice spacing .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , as an effective field theory of low - energy qcd , plays an important role in performing the multiple extrapolations needed to extrapolate lqcd results ( chiral extrapolations  @xcite , finite - volume corrections ( fvcs )  @xcite , and continuum extrapolations  @xcite ) to the physical world .    in this work",
    "we report on the first systematic study of the ground - state octet baryon masses in the covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) with the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) scheme up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) .",
    "the virtual decuplet contributions to the octet baryon masses and finite lattice volume and lattice spacing effects on the lattice data are studied .",
    "finally , the octet baryon sigma terms are predicted using the feynman - hellmann theorem .",
    "up to n@xmath3lo , the octet baryon masses with the virtual decuplet contributions can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the chiral limit octet baryon mass , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 correspond to the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 contributions from the octet - only eoms bchpt , respectively . the last term",
    "@xmath12 denotes the contributions of the virtual decuplet resonances up to n@xmath3lo .",
    "their explicit expressions and the corresponding fvcs can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to perform the continuum extrapolation of the lqcd simulations ,",
    "one can first write down the symanzik s effective filed theory  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we constructed the corresponding chiral lagrangians up to @xmath13 to study the finite lattice spacing effects on the octet baryon masses , which can be written as @xmath14    here we want to mention that there are @xmath15 unknown lecs ( @xmath5 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) needed to be fixed in the eoms bchpt at @xmath11 . furthermore , including the finite lattice spacing effects ( eq .  ( [ eq : aeffects ] ) ) , one has to introduce @xmath21 more combinations of the unknown lecs  @xcite .",
    "the details of the studies can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the main results .    in order to determine all the lecs and test the consistency of the current lqcd simulations , we perform a simultaneous fit to all the publicly available @xmath0 lqcd data from the pacs - cs  @xcite , lhpc  @xcite , qcdsf - ukqcd  @xcite , hsc  @xcite , and nplqcd  @xcite collaborations . to ensure that the n@xmath3lo bchpt stays in its applicability range ,",
    "fitted lqcd data are limited to those satisfying @xmath22 gev@xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we found that the octet - only eoms bchpt shows a good description of the lqcd and experimental data with order - by - order improvement . up to n@xmath3lo , the @xmath25 is about @xmath26 , which indicates that the lattice simulations from these five collaborations are consistent with each other  , although their setups are very different .",
    "in addition , we showed that the explicit inclusion of the virtual decuplet baryons does not change the description of the lqcd data in any significant way , at least at @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that using only the octet baryon mass data , one can not disentangle the virtual decuplet contributions from those of the virtual octet baryons and tree - level diagrams . on the other hand",
    ", we notice that the explicit inclusion of the virtual decuplet baryons does seem to improve slightly the description of the fvcs , especially for the lqcd data with small @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the virtual decuplet contributions to the octet baryon masses are not taken into account in our following studies .",
    "to study discretization effects on the ground - state octet baryon masses , we constructed the relevant chiral lagrangians up to @xmath13 in ref .",
    "@xcite . by analyzing the latest @xmath0",
    "@xmath28-improved lqcd data of the pacs - cs , qcdsf - ukqcd , hsc and nplqcd collaborations , we found that the finite lattice spacing effects are at the order of @xmath29% for lattice spacings up to @xmath30 fm and the pion mass up to @xmath31 mev , which is in agreement with other lqcd studies .",
    "finally , the octet baryon sigma terms are predicted using the feynman - hellmann theorem . in order to obtain an accurate determination of sigma terms ,",
    "a careful examination of the lqcd data is essential , since not all of them are of the same quality though they are largely consistent with each other . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we only employed the pacs - cs , lhpc and qcdsf - ukqcd data .",
    "we also took into account the scale setting effects of the lqcd simulations and studied systematic uncertainties from truncating chiral expansions . furthermore , strong - interaction isospin breaking effects to the baryon masses were for the first time employed to better constrain the relevant lecs up to n@xmath3lo .",
    "we predict the nucleon sigma terms as @xmath1 mev and @xmath2 mev , which are consistent with recent lqcd and bchpt studies .",
    "we have studied the lowest - lying octet baryon masses in the eoms bchpt up to n@xmath3lo .",
    "the unknown low - energy constants are determined by a simultaneous fit to the latest @xmath0 lqcd simulations , and it is shown that the lqcd results are consistent with each other , though their setups are quite different .",
    "the contributions of virtual decuplet resonances are explicitly included and we find that their effects on the octet baryon masses are small , especially for the chiral extrapolations .",
    "we have studied finite - volume corrections and finite lattice spacing effects on the lqcd baryon masses as well .",
    "we find that their effects are of similar size but finite volume corrections are more important to better constrain the lecs and to reduce the @xmath32 .    using the feynman - hellmann theorem ,",
    "we have performed an accurate determination of the nucleon sigma terms , focusing on the uncertainties from the lattice scale setting method and chiral expansions .",
    "our predictions are @xmath1 mev and @xmath2 mev , which are consistent with most of the recent lqcd and bchpt studies",
    ". however , further lqcd simulations are needed to reduce the uncertainty of the nucleon strangeness - sigma term .",
