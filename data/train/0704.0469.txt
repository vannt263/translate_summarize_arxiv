    "we start by showing a one - to - one correspondence between arrangements of @xmath0 lines in @xmath1 , and lines in @xmath2 .",
    "this correspondence is a particular case of a more general one between arrangements of @xmath0 sections on ruled surfaces , which generalize line arrangements ( see remark [ r0 ] ) , and certain curves in @xmath2 .",
    "this was developed by the author in @xcite .",
    "in there , we consider arrangements as single curves via moduli spaces of pointed stable rational curves .",
    "one of the main ingredients is the description of these moduli spaces given by kapranov in @xcite and @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we only treat the case of line arrangements , giving a proof of this correspondence by means of quite elementary geometry .",
    "an important consequence of seeing an arrangement as a single curve is , as it turns out , to answer questions about realization of certain line arrangements . that is the second part of this paper . through this correspondence ,",
    "we are able to classify the so - called @xmath3-nets over @xmath4 for all @xmath9 , and the quaternion nets .",
    "this classification shows various new properties for @xmath7-nets , and opens the question about realization of latin squares in @xmath10 ( they give the combinatorial data which defines a @xmath7-net ) .",
    "the following is an outline of the paper .    in section [ s2 ] , we prove a one - to - one correspondence between arrangements of @xmath0 lines , and lines in @xmath2 .",
    "an arrangement of @xmath0 lines is a set @xmath11 of @xmath0 labeled lines in @xmath1 such that @xmath12 . as it was pointed out above , our general correspondence is between arrangements of sections and curves .",
    "for this reason , instead of considering line arrangements , we consider pairs @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an arrangement of @xmath0 lines , and @xmath15 is a point outside of @xmath16 . in proposition",
    "[ p1 ] , we prove a one - to - one correspondence between these pairs , up to projective equivalence , and lines in @xmath2 outside of a fixed hyperplane arrangement @xmath17 .",
    "we also sketch a second proof of it ( see remark [ r0 ] ) to hint the more general correspondence mentioned before ( see @xcite for details ) .    under this correspondence , for a fixed arrangement @xmath14 , different choices of @xmath18 may produce different lines in @xmath2 . thus , if one fixes the combinatorial type of @xmath14 and wants to study its moduli space , the presence of this artificial point @xmath18 introduces more parameters than needed . in practice ,",
    "even the question of realization of @xmath14 becomes hard with this extra point @xmath18 . to eliminate this difficulty",
    ", we take @xmath18 in @xmath14 and consider the new pair @xmath19 , where the lines in @xmath20 are the lines in @xmath14 not containing @xmath18 ( with a certain labelling ) . by taking @xmath18 as a point lying on several lines of @xmath14 , one greatly simplifies computations to prove or disprove its realization over some field , and to find a moduli space for its combinatorial type .    in sections",
    "[ s3 ] and [ s4 ] , we use our method to study a particular type of line arrangements which are called nets .",

    "we exemplify our correspondence by computing the hesse arrangement , which is the only @xmath22-net over @xmath4 , and by showing that @xmath23-nets do not exist in characteristic different than @xmath24 ( they do in characteristic @xmath24 , see example [ e3 ] ) . in @xcite",

    "it is believed that the only @xmath28-net is the hesse arrangement . in section [ s4 ]",
    ", we present a classification for @xmath3-nets over @xmath4 with @xmath9 .",
    "it is known that a @xmath30 latin square provides the combinatorial data which defines a @xmath3-net ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . until very recently , the only known @xmath3-nets corresponded to latin squares coming from multiplication tables of certain abelian groups .",
    "yuzvinsky conjectured in @xcite that this should always be the case . in @xcite ,",
    "there was given a three dimensional family of @xmath31-nets not coming from a group .",
    "for the case @xmath6 , we have twelve possible cases associated to the twelve main classes of @xmath32 latin squares . in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "we show that only nine of them are realizable in @xmath1 over @xmath4 .",
    "these nine cases present new properties for @xmath7-nets : we have four three dimensional and five two dimensional families , some of them define nets strictly over @xmath4 , for others we have nets over @xmath33 or even over @xmath34 , etc . after that",
    ", we construct a three dimensional family of @xmath8-nets associated to the quaternion group , which has members defined over @xmath34 .",
    "the new cases corresponding to the symmetric and quaternion groups show that there are @xmath3-nets associated to non - abelian groups ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conj . 6.1 ) ) . out of this , a natural question is : _ find a combinatorial characterization of the main classes of latin squares ( see remark [ r2 ] ) which realize @xmath3-nets in @xmath10_.    we denote the projective space of dimension @xmath35 by @xmath36 , and a point in it by @xmath37=[x_i]_{i=1}^{n+1}$ ] . if @xmath38 are @xmath39 distinct points in @xmath36 , then @xmath40 is the projective linear space spanned by them .",
