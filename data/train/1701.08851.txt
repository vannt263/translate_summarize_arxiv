    "the problem of phase transitions is always interesting for physicists @xcite . in the vicinity of a phase transition",
    "the main characteristics of the system are changed drastically under relatively small changes of the governing parameters ( such as the temperature , external fields , pressure , etc . )",
    "phase transition points ( lines ) divide thermodynamic states of matter , phases .",
    "each of such phases is determined by the order parameter ( or its absence ) .",
    "hence , the investigation of phase transitions permits us to better understand the nature of the properties of phases of matter without large changes of external conditions . on the other hand",
    ", it helps us to understand the occurrence of the discontinuities of thermodynamic functions at the phase transitions .",
    "phase transitions are usually classified by their order .",
    "the latter is determined by the divergence of the derivative of the thermodynamic potential at the phase transition .",
    "usually one studies the first order transitions ( in which two phases can coexist at the same values of the governing parameter ) , and the second order ones ( or the continuous phase transitions ) , where phases do not coexist .    until the last three decades physicists mostly study phase transitions occurring at nonzero temperatures .",
    "the characteristic feature of such phase transitions is that namely thermal fluctuations destroy the long range order . when describing continuous phase transitions it is often useful to consider the variable @xmath0 ,",
    "( do not confuse with time ) , where @xmath1 is the temperature , and @xmath2 is the critical value of the temperature , at which the phase transition takes place .",
    "then the correlation length @xmath3 diverges as @xmath4 , and the correlation ( or equilibration ) time @xmath5 is divergent as @xmath6 . here @xmath7 is called the correlation length critical exponent , and @xmath8 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "it means that spatial and dynamical correlations become long - ranged at the transition point .",
    "there are no other universal space and time scales in the vicinity of the phase transition , except of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , which become infinite at the critical point .",
    "that means that fluctuations occur at all time and space scales , and the system is scale invariant .",
    "such a scale - invariant situation is usually described by the number of critical exponents , which determine the behavior of the specific heat ( @xmath9 ) order parameter ( @xmath10 ) , susceptibility ( @xmath11 ) , critical isotherm ( @xmath12 ) , and correlation function ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the values of the critical exponents are connected via so - called scaling @xmath14 and hyper - scaling relations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of space . since in classical statistical mechanics statics and dynamics",
    "totally decouple from each other , the dynamical exponent @xmath8 is independent of other critical exponents . remarkable feature of the second order phase transitions is their universality .",
    "the latter is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter in the ordered phase and by the dimension @xmath16 .",
    "however , during the last decades , other phase transitions attract the attention of physicists . in those phase transitions , which take place at zero temperature ( in the ground state ) the non - thermal governing parameter @xmath17 ( like the pressure , magnetic field , chemical composition , etc . )",
    "regulates their behavior .",
    "such phase transitions are known now as quantum phase transitions , or quantum critical points @xcite . at the point @xmath18 ( called the quantum critical point ) quantum , not thermal ,",
    "fluctuations destroy the long range ordering .",
    "the characteristic energy scale , at which quantum fluctuations are essential is @xmath19 .",
    "quantum fluctuations become more important for @xmath20 ( we use the units , in which boltzmann s constant is unity @xmath21 ) .",
    "when the typical frequency scale goes to zero , we have @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "quantum fluctuations become unimportant , and one can use classical description of phase transitions . on the other hand , in the ground state the behavior of the characteristics of the phase transition become totally quantum , and we have @xmath24 .    while the behavior of equilibrium phase transitions is by",
    "now relatively well understood , the behavior of physical systems , especially , of quantum systems out of equilibrium , is understood much less .",
    "quantum systems out of equilibrium , e.g. , after abrupt changes of their parameters , are basically not susceptible to general principles of equilibrium systems .",
    "this is why , studies of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body models are necessary for the fundamental understanding of how mechanics emerges under the unitary time evolution .",
    "the time evolution of averages depends on the initial state through the values of a large number of parameters of the quantum system .",
    "it disagrees with the standard ensembles of statistical mechanics , which use few conserved values of the dynamical system and usually describe the behavior after relaxation . in the isolated system",
    "the energy is a conserved quantity . in the absence of other conserved quantities generic isolated systems",
    "are believed to relax to thermal equilibrium , i.e. , to the gibbs ensemble with an effective temperature , known as thermalization @xcite .",
    "thermalization should occur independently of the initial state of the system , and it is important to study the case in which the system is initialized in the highly excited eigenstate at the finite density of the energy .",
    "the dynamics then is simple .",
    "however the thermalization requires the statistical mechanics to be encoded in the chosed eigenstate , which is formulated as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the system remains in a pure state at all times , and the reduced density matrix of a small subsystem should take a gibbs form with the effective temperature , depending only on the energy density of the chosen state .",
    "the expectation values of local observables in this eigenstate are smooth functions of the energy , which coincide with the microcanonical ensemble at the corresponding density of the energy . on the other hand ,",
    "integrable systems evolve to a generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite due to the presence of the infinite number of integrals of motion in integrable systems .",
    "contrary , models with weak integrability - breaking interactions exhibit transient behavior , with local observables relaxing to non - thermal values , known as pre - thermalization @xcite .",
    "common believe is that at `` sufficiently long times '' pre - termalized systems thermalize .    abrupt changes of some parameters lead to the unitary time evolution , and the final ( long time ) state strongly depends on the type of the system .",
    "their studies can provide the information of how fast correlations spread in quantum systems , whether averages can decay to some time - independent values , and which parameters can govern those processes .",
    "the study of dynamics of the quantum coherence is very important for the modern theory of quantum computation , where namely sudden changes are used to govern the behavior of ensembles of qubits @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the study of sudden changes is very important in the context of experiments on ultracold gases , @xcite thz pulses @xcite observed in solids , @xcite or high magnetic field experiments in pulse fields .",
    "@xcite for ultracold gases , for instance , the coherence is maintained for much longer times than for usual condensed matter , and the time evolution of a quantum system after the abrupt changes has become an important concept .",
    "very recently , the novel concept of phase transitions has been pioneered @xcite : the dynamical quantum phase transitions .",
    "below we review the main ideas of this very interesting and quickly developing field of modern quantum physics .",
    "analyzing the behavior of lattice magnetic models in statistical mechanics it is often useful to express the partition function as a polynomial of the temperature or the external magnetic field .",
    "the properties of a polynomial are totally determined by the behavior of its roots .",
    "this is why , the knowledge of the behavior of zeros of the partition function gives us the possibility to know the total thermodynamics of the studied system .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the distribution of such zeros permits to describe exactly thermodynamics of the considered problem .    according to the lee - yang theorem @xcite the partition function of a statistical model ( with ferromagnetic interactions ) is the function of an external magnetic field , then all zeros of the partition function are imaginary ( or after the change of variables they are distributed on a unit circle ) . consider the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 are ising spin variables , @xmath27 are ferromagnetic coupling constants , and @xmath28 is the external field .",
    "the partition function of the system with the hamiltonian @xmath29 can be written as @xcite ( here we normalize all values of @xmath30 and @xmath28 by the real positive temperature @xmath1 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the even measure on real @xmath33 , which decreases at infinity , i.e. , @xmath34 , with any real @xmath35 belonging to @xmath33 .",
    "suppose all zeros of the generalized fourier transformation of the measure @xmath36 are real for any complex @xmath37 .",
    "then , if the values @xmath38 have the positive real part , the partition function is nonzero , @xmath39 . in other words , the partition function vanishes for purely imaginary magnetic fields @xmath28 . in the ising model the above mentioned measures are related to the set of values @xmath40 , so that the partition function can be considered as a function of the variables @xmath41 .",
    "after such a change of variables we see that all zeros of @xmath42 lie on the unit circle @xmath43 . if the partition function has no zeros , then the free energy is the analytic function , and corresponding system does not undergo a phase transition .",
    "contrary , if zeros of the partition function do close onto the positive real axis of @xmath8 , each of such roots would correspond to a discontinuity of the derivative of the free energy , i.e. , to the phase transition of the ising model .",
    "the density of roots determines the order of the phase transition .",
    "lee and yang have generalized this result to any problem of lattice gases with pairwise attraction between particles on a lattice ( the condition of the finite even measure at infinity is translated to the infinite repulsion of particles , if two of them occupy the same site ) .",
    "the consequences of the lee - yang theorem are , e.g. , that the lattice gas can not undergo more than one phase transition , which corresponds to @xmath44 . in particular , for the ising model the @xmath45-@xmath1 phase diagram contains smooth lines , except possibly at zero magnetic field ( i.e. , at @xmath44 ) .",
    "in fact , fisher @xcite , instead of the analytic continuation of the external field to complex values , as lee and yang did , proposed to study the analytic prolongation of the partition function to complex temperatures @xmath46 , where fisher s zeros are determined from @xmath47 .",
    "as the size of the system goes to infinity , fisher s zeros approach the real axis .",
    "the density of the free energy can be written in the thermodynamic limit @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of sites , as @xmath50 all contributions to the partition function are terms like @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , and , hence , they are entire functions of @xmath8 . therefore , for a finite @xmath49 the partition function is also an entire function of @xmath8 . according to the weierstrass factorization theorem @xcite the partition function ( as any entire function with zeros )",
    "can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is also the entire function .",
    "therefore , we can write for the density of the free energy @xmath55 \\ .\\ ] ] the non - analytic part of the free energy per site is determined , this way , only by zeroes @xmath38 : @xmath56 in the thermodynamic limit the sum becomes an integral over some continuous variable @xmath42 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the region , corresponding to the set of @xmath59 . after the transformation of the integral we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the jacobian determinant , which can be considered as the density of zeroes in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend the integration over the full complex plane by setting @xmath62 for @xmath8 not belonging to @xmath63 .",
    "consider now the real part @xmath64 = - \\int d{\\tilde z } \\rho({\\tilde z } ) \\ln |1 - ( z/{\\tilde z})| \\ .\\ ] ] for @xmath65 the function @xmath66 is green s function of the two - dimensional laplacian @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 it means that the density of the free energy can be interpreted as the electrostatic potential @xmath69 produced by the charge density @xmath70 in two dimensions .",
    "hence , the behavior of the free energy at critical points is equivalent to the behavior of the electrostatic potential at surfaces .",
    "if zeros form lines in the complex plane , then it is possible to deduce the order of the phase transition directly from the density of zeros @xcite .",
    "zeros can form areas in the complex plane .",
    "these areas can not cover the physical axis for equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "however , see below , it is possible for dynamical phase transitions .    for example , for the ising model , in the thermodynamic limit fisher s zeros in the complex temperature plane approach the real axis at the critical value of the temperature @xmath71 .",
    "it is the direct indication of the phase transition .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising model fisher showed that his zeros lie also on a unit circle .",
    "however , later it was understood that it is rather exception than the rule , and it is impossible to formulate the analog of the lee - yang theorem for fisher s zeros @xcite .",
    "fisher s zeros form smooth curves , and can , generally speaking , densely occupy entire regions in the complex plane @xmath8 .",
    "however , in contrast to the lee - yang zeros , the partition function with fisher s zeros is not a simple polynomial in the complex temperature plane . in a finite system phase transitions can not occur , and the fisher zeros are isolated and do not lie on the real axis in the complex temperature plane .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit fisher s zeros coalesce into lines or areas , which can cross the real axis .",
    "such a crossing signal the breakdown of the analytic continuation of the density of the free energy as a function of temperature .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics , related to the concept of the time reversal , was the subject of many discussions .",
    "one of them between joseph loschmidt and ludwig boltzmann , is known as the loschmidt paradox .",
    "loschmidt pointed out that due to the time - reversal invariance of classical mechanics , an evolution must exist , in which the entropy of the considered system can decrease @xcite .",
    "as an example , he considered the case of gas in which all velocities of molecules reverse their sign .",
    "then the entropy of the system would decrease , violating the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "boltzmann answered @xcite that such a time - reversal is impossible .",
    "he pointed out the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics for generic macroscopic systems .",
    "boltzmann s statement is naturally true for statistical mechanics , however , the loschmidt paradox can be important for the study of time - reversal dynamics of quantum systems .    in the isolated quantum system",
    "the time evolution is unitary .",
    "it implies that if one considers the pure state , then , after the evolution the isolated system remains in the pure state . on the other hand ,",
    "the connection to the environment yields absence of such a conservation , i.e. , to the decoherence .",
    "namely the decoherence , that is related to the interference with the degrees of freedom of the environment of the studied quantum system , produces the classical behavior of the macroscopic systems .",
    "the decoherence is the reason for limitation of the use of many quantum systems as elements of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "considering the time evolution of a quantum system it is often instructive to study the behavior of the so - called loschmidt amplitude ( or the loschmidt echo ) .",
    "it is determined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the wave function of a quantum system at time @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the hamiltonian governing the forward evolution , and @xmath76 is the hamiltonian governing the backward recovery evolution . in such a description",
    "the loschmidt echo defines the degree of ( ir)reversibility of the quantum system . from the other viewpoint ,",
    "it can be considered as the overlap at time @xmath77 of two time - evoluted wave functions under the effect of two hamiltonians , @xmath78 , i.e. the loschmidt amplitude can be considered as the measure for the response of the evolution of a quantum system to perturbations , the fidelity .",
    "the loschmidt amplitude as the measure of the time - reversal , permits to quantify the decoherence effects .",
    "the loschmidt amplitude is usually the decreasing function of time .",
    "the main problem is to determine the way of such a decay .",
    "it is determined by the most important physical processes , while less important are filtered out by the loschmidt echo . the return probability ( for @xmath79 )",
    "can be defined as @xmath80    the loschmidt amplitude is related to many aspects of research activity of physicists . here",
    "we can mention , e.g. , the spin echo in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , consideration of dynamics of nonlinear waves , studies of the quantum chaos , the decoherence in open quantum systems , and statistical mechanics in small systems .",
    "it was predicted to be important in many experiments with ultracold atoms trapped in optical cavities @xcite .",
    "last but not the least , the loschmidt amplitude is used in the theory of dynamical quantum phase transitions , which we analyze below .",
    "we will mostly consider the response of a quantum system to the global perturbation , i.e. , the one , which affects all ( or the main part ) of the phase space of the system under the time evolution .",
    "consider the loschmidt amplitude for the case in which the backward evolution is excluded , i.e. , @xmath81 ( and @xmath82 ) .",
    "this can be related , e.g. , to the situation of the quantum quench , which is the evolution of the quantum system after the sudden change of some parameter(s ) of the hamiltonian of the considered system .",
    "the loschmidt amplitude then describes the evolution of the initially prepared in some initial ( pure ) eigenstate @xmath73 of the hamiltonian @xmath83 , under the dynamics , which is regulated by @xmath29 ( with the changed parameter ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath84 , i.e. , the overlap of the time - evolved quantum state with itself at @xmath74 , in this case is similar to the partition function @xmath85 $ ] as the function of the complex temperature , as fisher suggested , if one considers instead of time the complex variable @xmath8 .",
    "we can again determine the density @xmath86 where @xmath73 play the role of boundary states ( for the partition function ) .",
    "we have shown above that the breakdown of the high - temperature expansion of the partition function signals about the temperature - driven phase transition .",
    "then , the non - analytic time evolution of the loschmidt amplitude can be considered as the breakdown of the short time expansion at a critical time .",
    "it permitted to call such a situation as the dynamical ( quantum ) phase transition . in most of considered so far cases ,",
    "the ground state of the quantum system defines @xmath73 , and , the non - analyticity of the time evolution at the critical time can be determined as the dynamical quantum phase transition .",
    "let us return to the analogy between the density of the free energy ( now the density of the loschmidt amplitude ) and the behavior of the electrostatic potential in a plane @xcite .",
    "consider the density of zeros @xmath87 in the area i , and the density @xmath88 in the area ii . at the boundary between areas",
    "there is a discontinuous change in the density of zeros .",
    "let @xmath89 to be the solutions of the laplace equation with corresponding density .",
    "then consider the behavior of @xmath69 at the intersection of the boundary with the real time axis . through stokes theorem",
    "we get @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the coordinate , parallel to the boundary .",
    "then , we transform to the other set of co - ordinate @xmath92 where @xmath9 is the angle between @xmath77 and @xmath42 ( the latter is normal to the boundary ) . combining it with the laplace equation we get @xmath93 or @xmath94 = -2\\pi \\cos^2 \\alpha [ \\rho_1(z)-\\rho_2(z ) ] \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "it means that if the area of zeros of the loschmidt amplitude overlaps the the real time axis , the second derivative of the real part of the dynamical free energy is discontinuous .",
    "we start the description of dynamical quantum phase transitions using as an example the one - dimesional chain of ising spins-1/2 in the transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such a model often serves as a paradigm for the behavior of quantum phase transitions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the exchange constant , @xmath45 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath97 are operators of projections of a spin 1/2 situated at the site @xmath59 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized using the jordan - wigner , fourier , and bogolyubov transformation .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite yields @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion at the site @xmath59 .",
    "fourier transformation and bogolyubov transformation yields @xmath101 $ ] , where @xmath102 fermions fulfill either antiperiodic or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "those are usually refereed to as the neveu - schwarz , or ramond sectors , respectively .",
    "the momenta @xmath103 are quantized as either half - integer or integer of @xmath104 , respectively , @xmath105 for antiperiodic , and @xmath106 for the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that in the ground state the system undergoes the quantum phase transition . for @xmath107",
    "the ising chain is ordered with the order parameter @xmath108 @xcite . in this phase the transverse field ising model possesses two degenerate ground states @xmath109 , in which @xmath110 . on the other hand , for @xmath111",
    "the system is disordered and the ground state is unique . the correlation length diverges at @xmath112 with the correlation function exponent @xmath113 .",
    "nonzero temperature destroys magnetic ordering , as usual for one - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "now we are in position to describe the dynamical quantum phase transitions in the transverse field ising chain .",
    "suppose for @xmath114 the system was in equilibrium with the hamiltonian @xmath29 with @xmath115 .",
    "then , at @xmath74 the value of the magnetic field is suddenly changed to @xmath116 ( i.e. , we have the quantum quench situation ) .",
    "then the density of the logarithm of the loschmidt amplitude is the rate function of the return amplitude , @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "the latter can be rewritten as @xmath118 where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 = { j\\sin k\\over h - j\\cos k }   \\ .\\ ] ] here we have dropped the contribution from the ground state ( zero oscillations ) @xmath121 , because it obviously does not contribute to dynamics .",
    "notice that the return probability is @xmath122)$ ] .",
    "the description above only applies to quenches starting from the unique ground state for the fermionic model , i.e. , to the neveu - schwarz sector for any finite system . in the paramagnetic phase @xmath123 this state corresponds to the superposition of two degenerate ground states @xmath109 @xcite",
    "this is why , the situation with quantum quenches starting from one of the spin - polarized phases @xmath124 can not be described by eq .",
    "( [ dens1 ] ) .",
    "however , when one starts from either of two degenerate ferromagnetic states , the cusps in the behavior of some time - dependent characteristics of the transverse field ising chain persist , see below .",
    "the loschmidt amplitude , that way , measures the effect of the quench on the system . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamical quantum phase transitions occur whenever the initial state is orthogonal to the time - evolved state after the quantum quench .",

    "it is important to stress that the mode @xmath152 is distingushed because in the ground state the occupation of that mode is @xmath164 in the basis of eigenstates of the final hamiltonian @xmath165 .",
    "modes with @xmath166 have the thermal occupation @xmath167 , natural for positive temperatures .",
    "however , modes with @xmath168 have inverted population @xmath169 , which is reminiscent of the formally negative effective temperature .",
    "hence , the mode with @xmath152 corresponds to the infinite effective temperature . for any quantum quenches across the quantum critical point",
    "such a mode exists , and , hence , the lines of fisher s zeros cut the time axis ( quasi)periodically , implying dynamical quantum phase transitions .",
    "the existence of such a mode in relation to spatial correlations was discussed @xcite .",
    "in fact , the short time expansion for the rate function @xmath170 ( or for the loschmidt amplitude @xmath171 and the return probability @xmath172 ) is broken down in the thermodynamic limit if there exists a quench across the quantum critical point .",
    "it is totally analogous to the breakdown of the high - temperature expansion of the free energy ( or the partition function ) for the phase transition in equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for slow ramping @xmath173 plays the role of the mass ( gap ) @xmath174 of the final state hamiltonian of the transverse ising chain . here",
    "the system can be described in terms of massive majorana fields @xcite .    that mass is the only energy scale in the equilibrium for the ising chain for @xmath175 . on the other hand , this energy is related to the new energy scale , which is generated by the quantum quench . in the vicinity of the quantum critical point of the system , described by the finite hamiltonian , @xmath176 ( @xmath177 )",
    "one gets that @xmath178 , and , therefore , @xmath179 becomes different from the mass ( gap ) .",
    "dynamical quantum phase transitions in the transverse field ising chain manifest themselves also in the time dependence of the order parameter after the quantum quench . for the transverse field ising chain the ground state order parameter",
    "is @xmath108 , which is nonzero for @xmath180 .",
    "the calculation of the time dependence of the order parameter was performed in @xcite . for quenches , starting in the disordered phase @xmath181 ,",

    "<S> during recent years the interest to dynamics of quantum systems has grown considerably . </S>",
    "<S> quantum many body systems out of equilibrium often manifest behavior , different from the one predicted by standard statistical mechanics and thermodynamics in equilibrium . since the dynamics of a many body quantum system typically involve many excited eigenstates , with a non - thermal distribution , the time evolution of such a system provides an unique way for investigation of non - equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> last decade such new subjects like quantum quenches , thermalization , pre - thermalization , equilibration , generalized gibbs ensemble , etc . </S>",
    "<S> are among the most attractive topics of investigation in modern quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting themes in the study of dynamics of quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium is connected with the recently proposed important concept of dynamical quantum phase transitions . during the last few years </S>",
    "<S> a great progress has been achieved in studying of those singularities in the time dependence of characteristics of quantum mechanical systems , in particular , in understanding how the quantum critical points of equilibrium thermodynamics affect their dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal universality , scaling , connection to the topology , and many other interesting features . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the recent achievements of this quickly developing part of low temperature quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> the study of dynamical quantum phase transitions is especially important in context of their connection to the problem of the modern theory of quantum information , where namely non - equilibrium dynamics of many - body quantum system plays the major role .    </S>",
