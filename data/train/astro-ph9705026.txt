    "frequencies of low - order ( @xmath5 ) high - degree ( @xmath6 ) solar modes are measured with an accuracy of about 0.2% ( libbrecht , woodard & kaufmann 1990 , bachmann , duval , harvey , & hill 1995 ) .",
    "it is found that the observed frequencies of the fundamental mode are smaller than the theoretically expected value of @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",
    "one may expect that turbulent convective flows with characteristic velocities @xmath9 , in the region with a characteristic sound speed @xmath10 , will cause a fractional frequency shift of the order @xmath11 , @xmath8 shift .",
    "magnetic fields seem to be less important than turbulent motions , because they reach equipartition strengths only in sunspots .",
    "also , frequency shifts due to magnetic fields should be positive .",
    "we will ignore magnetic fields in what follows .",
    "the negative sign of the shifts was explained by the following simple argument ( murawski & roberts 1993 ; rosenthal 1996 ) . consider a sound wave propagation through a layer of thickness @xmath12 .",
    "let the flow velocity along the wavevector be @xmath13 in the first sub - layer of thickness @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in the second sub - layer .",
    "then the total propagation time @xmath16 , and the effective sound speed is @xmath17 . therefore the fractional frequency shift , @xmath18 , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 comes from the angle average .",
    "the above kinematic explanation is incomplete .",
    "the sound speed in a random homogeneous isotropic flow depends on the wavelength .",
    "we show in  2 that the effective sound speed is increased in the long wavelength limit and decreased in the short wavelength limit .",
    "we discuss the solar frequency shifts in  3 .",
    "our perturbation theory ( pt ) calculations are in principle straightforward , but algebraically tedious ; appendices explain how we performed the calculations and tested the results .",
    "we will assume that the turbulence mach number is so small that the turbulent flow is approximately stationary ( even at time scales of the long wavelength acoustic modes ) .",
    "only the turbulent velocity field , @xmath22 , can give frequency shifts that are quadratic in @xmath2 .",
    "turbulent pressure , density and entropy fluctuations are quadratic in @xmath2 , and give rise to @xmath23 frequency shifts that can be neglected . to within this accuracy , @xmath24 in the absence of stratification .    in the leading order",
    ", one can find the shift caused by a single fourier harmonic of the flow , and then average the result over all harmonics .",
    "since velocity gradient of a fourier harmonic of the incompressible flow is perpendicular to the velocity , it is sufficient to solve the problem for a shear flow @xmath25 the sound wave frequency in an isotropic random flow is then obtained by taking an appropriate average .",
    "we will use the fact that @xmath22 is a pure fourier harmonic later in our calculation , but at this stage @xmath22 may be thought of as an arbitrary shear flow with a zero mean .",
    "we first obtain a convenient representation for the linear sound wave equation in the presence of a shear flow .",
    "let the velocity perturbations ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and dimensionless density perturbation ( @xmath29 ) associated with the sound wave depend on @xmath30 in an unspecified way , and be proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "then , denoting the @xmath30-derivative by a prime , and using the standard notation @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    equations ( 2)-(5 ) give the velocity perturbations in terms of the density perturbation .",
    "using these expressions in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we get @xmath37 where @xmath38 . up to the second order in @xmath22",
    ", this equation can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the linear perturbation operator @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the quadratic perturbation operator @xmath43 in the above expressions we have replaced @xmath44 by the unperturbed value @xmath45 , knowing that the frequency shift due to the linear perturbation @xmath40 vanishes in the first order pt .",
    "quadratic perturbation @xmath42 gives a finite shift in the first order pt . denoting the unperturbed mode by @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath47 averaging over angles gives a fractional frequency shift @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the linear perturbation @xmath40 gives a non - zero frequency shift in the second order pt , @xmath50 for a sinusoidal shear flow with a wavenumber @xmath51 , the sum is over @xmath52 , and the above expression gives @xmath53 averaging this equation over the angle between @xmath54 and @xmath51 yields @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the cosine of the angle . for @xmath57 , there is a pole due to the resonant scattering .",
    "the frequency shift is given by the principal value of the integral .",
    "the imaginary part gives the damping , which in the solar context corresponds to the line - width ( goldreich & murray 1994 ) .",
    "we do not consider line - widths in this work .",
    "the integral is trivial in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath58 , @xmath59 summing the two contributions , eq.(12 ) and eq.(16 ) , we get a total fractional frequency shift @xmath60 in the short - wavelength limit , @xmath61 , eq.(15 ) gives @xmath62 and the total short - wavelength shift is given by @xmath63    the fractional shifts in the asymptotic regions are wavevector independent .",
    "this is equivalent to the sound speed renormalization .",
    "the long - wavelength sound speed is higher than @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the short - wavelength sound speed is lower than @xmath64 , @xmath66 .",
    "these results were confirmed analytically ( appendix a ) and by numerical calculations ( appendix b ) .",
    "the above results are not directly applicable to the problem of the solar @xmath67 and @xmath68-mode frequency shifts due to interactions with turbulent convection .",
    "the sun is stratified , and the solar convection is anisotropic and inhomogeneous .",
    "however the method of  2 , second - order pt analysis of the density equation , is still applicable .",
    "in  3.1 we derive the basic density equation analogous to eq.(8 ) . in  3.2 we specify the model of the solar stratification in the upper convection zone .",
    "we give a general formula for the frequency shifts in  3.3 , and calculate the f - mode shifts for a particular model of the solar convective turbulence in  3.4 .",
    "the aim is to calculate the eigenfrequencies of linear sound waves in a medium with an unperturbed density @xmath69 , sound speed @xmath64 , gravitational acceleration @xmath70 in the presence of a flow @xmath71 .",
    "we use a planar model for which @xmath69 and @xmath64 depend on the depth @xmath30 , whereas @xmath70 is independent of the depth . the convective flow @xmath71 satisfies the mass continuity equation @xmath72 .",
    "velocity perturbations @xmath73 and a density perturbation @xmath29 ( unlike  2.1 @xmath29 is not normalized to @xmath69 ) associated with the acoustic mode satisfy the linearized equations @xmath74 @xmath75 here and in what follows we use the convention that an operator acts on everything to the right of it , unless there is a bracket .",
    "we change variables , @xmath76 , and define three operators @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 then the system ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , can be written as @xmath80 @xmath81 now solve eq.(25 ) for @xmath27 in terms of @xmath29 expanding up to the second order in @xmath22 , @xmath82 substituting this expansion into eq.(26 ) , we get the basic perturbed density equation ( analogous to eq.(8 ) ) @xmath83 here the unperturbed operator is @xmath84 the linear perturbation operator is @xmath85 and the quadratic perturbation operator is @xmath86    before we can use the pt technique on eq . ( 28 ) , we have to specify the stratification , find the unperturbed eigenmodes , and `` hermitize '' @xmath87 .",
    "we use a polytropic model of the solar convection zone ( see goldreich & kumar 1990 ) . in this model",
    "the unperturbed ( bare ) sound speed is @xmath88 , where @xmath30 is the depth and @xmath89 is the polytropic index in the hydrogen ionization zone .",
    "then the unperturbed density equation , eq .",
    "( 28 ) with @xmath90 , reads @xmath91 for a horizontal wavenumber @xmath54 .",
    "an eigenmode with @xmath92 nodes in the vertical direction is of the form @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath92 .",
    "the dispersion law is @xmath95 .",
    "the modes with @xmath96 are the p - modes , and the @xmath97 mode is the fundamental mode ( f - mode ) .",
    "the fundamental mode frequency does not depend on the value of the polytropic index @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "this a familiar dispersion law of the deep - water gravity waves .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the f - mode frequency is @xmath7 for an arbitrary stratification .",
    "the solar stratification in the upper convection zone is not well known ( christensen - dalsgaard 1996 ) , making interpretation of the p - mode shifts difficult .",
    "but the f - mode shifts must be mostly turbulent ; we will concentrate on the f - mode shifts in  3.4 .    for a pt to be applicable",
    ", the unperturbed operator , @xmath87 , must be hermitian .",
    "this is achieved by introducing the scalar product @xmath100    knowing the unperturbed solutions and the scalar product we can now calculate the frequency shifts .",
    "we can use the unperturbed frequency in the perturbation operators @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "the quadratic perturbation @xmath42 gives a non - zero frequency shift in the first order pt .",
    "for a horizontal wavenumber @xmath54 and a mode order @xmath92 , we have @xmath101 a non - zero frequency shift from @xmath40 appears in the second order pt , @xmath102 the total frequency shift is a sum of eqs .",
    "( 34 ) and ( 35 ) .",
    "it remains to specify the flow @xmath22 and do the integrals .",
    "we use a two dimensional model with a @xmath103-axis in the horizontal direction . for a single fourier harmonic @xmath104 of the turbulent flow @xmath22 , the incompressibility of the mass flow , @xmath105 ,",
    "is satisfied by the velocity field of the form @xmath106 @xmath107 since the sound speed scales as @xmath108 , we choose the stream function that scales as @xmath109 at small depths @xmath30 , so as to make the mach number of the turbulence finite .",
    "we suppose that for a given horizontal scale of the convection , only one row of convective cells exists in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "this means that @xmath110 has a maximum at the depth of the order of @xmath111 , and then goes to zero at larger depths .",
    "we choose @xmath112 where the @xmath103-dependence is omitted , @xmath113 measures the aspect ratio of the convective cells . we will sum the frequency shifts due to different fourier components of the turbulence at the end of the calculation .    for a polytropic model of the solar convection zone ,",
    "the unperturbed eigenmodes are sums of products of exponentials and powers ( pep ) .",
    "we have chosen , eq.(38 ) , a convection stream function which is also a pep .",
    "the perturbation theory requires a number of differentiations , multiplications and additions ( which leave a pep a pep ) , followed by an integration ( a trivial algebraic operation for a pep ) .",
    "we wrote a numerical algebra program which performs all these operations .",
    "the program was tested as follows . in the interval",
    "@xmath114 the calculated frequency shifts coincided with the shifts calculated by the direct numerical simulations program described in appendix b. another reason to believe that we did not make a mistake , is that we succeeded in reconstructing analytical formulae with a correct algebraic structure from our numerical algebra program ( appendix c ) .",
    "we now present the results . for a single fourier harmonic of the flow ,",
    "the f - mode fractional frequency shift is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the long - wavelength ( @xmath115 ) shift is positive .",
    "the poles in the vicinity of @xmath116 are due to resonant scattering . the resonant condition , @xmath117 ,",
    "is satisfied by two families of solutions .",
    "the first family is @xmath118 which in our case ( @xmath119 ) gives resonances at @xmath120 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.67 , 0.71 , 0.75 , 0.78 , 0.8 , ... the first two of these are actually absent because the corresponding matrix elements vanish .",
    "the next five are seen in fig.1 , and higher resonances are not present because we summed the second - order pt shift , eq.(35 ) , only up to @xmath121 .",
    "the second family of resonances is given by @xmath122 which in our case is @xmath123 3 , 2 , 1.5 , ...",
    "these are shown in fig.2 , where the `` red '' resonances are too weak to be seen .",
    "fig.2 also shows that the resonances disappear without a trace when integrated over a spectrum of turbulent modes .",
    "even a rather narrow spectrum used in fig.2 reduces a complicated pattern of resonances to just two asymptotics and a transition region between them .",
    "the short - wavelength ( high - degree ) frequency shift does not depend on the aspect ratio of the turbulent eddies , @xmath113 , nor on the turbulence wavenumber , @xmath51 . with an accuracy better than 1%",
    ", the high - degree shift is given by @xmath124 where @xmath2 is the surface mach number of the turbulence .",
    "the low - degree shift depends on @xmath113 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is given by the following exact formula @xmath125 which is applicable for @xmath126 .",
    "smaller aspect ratios @xmath113 give higher maximal positive shifts @xmath127 , but we find that even the very small @xmath128 , gives @xmath129 , for a typical value of the mach number , @xmath130 . this is smaller than the current observational accuracy .",
    "the smallness of the maximal positive shift may be explained as follows . at",
    "very small @xmath54 , the mode s energy is concentrated at large depths , where the turbulence is too weak to produce a noticeable frequency shift . at larger @xmath54 ,",
    "the mode - turbulence interaction becomes stronger , but the negative short - wavelength shift takes over .",
    "the f - mode frequency shift is practically independent of the polytropic index @xmath98 .",
    "the high - degree shift for @xmath131 is @xmath132 , which is close to the @xmath119 result @xmath133 .",
    "we also calculated the frequency shifts for the @xmath134-mode and obtained similar results .",
    "the shape of the spectrum - averaged curve in fig.2 . seems to be correct . shown in fig.3",
    "are the data of libbrecht , woodard & kaufmann ( 1990 ) and the theoretical curve of fig.2 scaled to match the observations . in physical terms , the required scaling corresponds to the mach number of the turbulent convection @xmath135 , and the turbulent length scale @xmath136 .",
    "we have calculated the f - mode frequency shifts due to scattering of waves by turbulence using perturbation theory . a two dimensional model of convection",
    "was employed , but our methods are applicable to a three dimensional problem with only minor changes . given a turbulent velocity field",
    ", one can use the perturbation theory to calculate the turbulent f - mode frequency shifts and line - widths .",
    "the main qualitative results for our simplified model are that the long - wavelength ( wavelength larger than the turbulent eddy size ) frequency shifts are positive but unobservably small and the short - wavelength fractional shifts are negative and of the order of @xmath137 .    during the preparation of this manuscript",
    ", i received help and encouragement from pawan kumar , who suggested the problem .",
    "i thank john bahcall , daniel eisenstein , peter goldreich , michael isichenko , and eli waxman for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf phy-9513835 .",
    "to test the homogeneous flow results , eqs .",

( 11 ) , ( 14 ) predict @xmath145 since the average inverse squared wavenumber of the flow is @xmath146 the two results agree .",
    "in two dimensions , for a single horizontal fourier harmonic of the turbulent flow @xmath22 , direct numerical solution of the eigensystem describing linear sound waves is possible .",
    "if we wish to determine the quadratic in @xmath2 frequency shift of an acoustic wave with a horizontal wavenumber @xmath54 , only two satellites of the wave , @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( @xmath51 is the turbulence wavenumber ) must be included into the calculation .",

    "for the solar stratification , reliable results were obtained only for @xmath114 .",
    "the reasons for a poor performance of the program outside of this interval seem to be as follows .",
    "small @xmath54 require too large depths @xmath162 , because the mode is cut off at about @xmath163 .",
    "larger wavenumbers , @xmath164 , are in the resonance region , and the resonances are sensitive to the position of our unphysical bottom @xmath162 .",
    "however , numerical frequency shifts in the interval @xmath114 were @xmath162-independent to a few percent accuracy .",
    "these results agreed with the exact ( up to the numerical algebra ) calculation used in  3 .",
    "knowing the algebraic structure of the frequency shifts formulae , we used the numerical algebra program to obtain exact results .",
    "the simplest example is the first order pt shift @xmath165 given by eq.(34 ) .",
    "this shift is an integral of a sum of products of exponentials and powers ( pep ) .",
    "rescale the length , so that the turbulence wavenumber is @xmath166 , also take a unit - amplitude convection , a=1",
    ". then the exponential function of the pep under the integral ( 34 ) is @xmath167 .",
    "the highest power of @xmath30 in the pep is 7 .",
    "therefore , the resulting shift must be a polynomial in @xmath54 and @xmath113 divided by @xmath168 .",
    "the numerical algebra confirms this result . the reconstructed exact first order pt shift ( 34 )",
    "is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 we used our numerical algebra program to reconstruct analogous formulae for the second order pt sum , eq.(35 ) .",
    "these exact formulae were used to integrate out the resonances , as shown in fig .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath175 are identically zero for @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this explains the absence of `` red '' resonances at @xmath178 and at @xmath179 as seen in fig.1 .",
    "the lowest order in @xmath54 long - wavelength shift is entirely due to the first order pt shift , eq.(c1 ) .",
