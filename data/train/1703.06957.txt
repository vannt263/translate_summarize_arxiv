    "sample size determination is an essential part when planning clinical trials since an adequate sample size assures that the objectives of the clinical trial can be assessed with high statistical confidence .",
    "the conduct of clinical trials with inappropriate sample sizes is often considered unethical . @xcite in clinical trials with a continuous outcome variable , the sample size planning is often based on the assumption of normal data . in this case , the sample size is affected by the outcome variance and the assumed treatment effect size as well as the type i and type ii error rates . when planning the sample size , the treatment effect size is generally determined based on clinical relevancy and the type i and type ii error rates are selected from a set of agreed upon values .",
    "however , the outcome variance is usually unknown and determining it to calculate the sample size has been discussed extensively in literature . if historical trials with designs similar to the planned trial are available , the variance for the sample size formula can be estimated from the historical trials .",
    "@xcite others have also proposed to additionally consider the variability of such variance estimators in the sample size calculation . @xcite",
    "another possibility to obtain an estimate of the outcome variance is from a pilot study .",
    "pilot studies can either be internal or external and the difference being that internal pilot studies are part of the main clinical trial or and external pilot studies are a separate entity .",
    "@xcite the variance estimate from an external pilot study can be considered for the sample size planning of a clinical trial and to adjust for the uncertainty of the estimate from the pilot study , it has be proposed to consider upper confidence limits of the variance instead of the variance estimate .",
    "@xcite the mentioned approaches all aim to plan the sample size of a new clinical trial based on external information about the variance .",
    "naturally , there is no guarantee that the outcome variance of a clinical trial corresponds to the estimate obtained from external information . for situations",
    "in which information on the variance is uncertain , it has been proposed to include an internal pilot study into the design of a clinical trial and to re - estimated the outcome variance ( or nuisance parameters in general ) , and thus the sample size of the ongoing clinical trial , based on the results of the internal pilot study.@xcite nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation in clinical trials has been studied extensively and we refer to reviews for a detailed recapitulation .",
    "@xcite + in this manuscript we focus on two - arm parallel group superiority trials with normally distributed endpoints planned and analyzed using frequentist methods .",
    "we assume that the clinical trial design includes an internal pilot study with a nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation and that variance estimates from several similar historical clinical trials are available when planning the new clinical trial .",
    "the information about the variance from the historical clinical trials are then summarized by a meta - analysis using a bayesian hierarchical model and the predicted variance of a new clinical trial is formalized as an meta - analytic - predictive ( map ) prior .",
    "@xcite we study several methods to incorporate the prior information into the unblinded sample size re - estimation and assess the performance characteristics of the respective sample size re - estimation procedures ; these are the power and the distribution of the final sample size , in a monte - carlo simulation study .",
    "we focus on re - estimating the sample size such that the clinical trials maintains a prespecified power .",
    "our motivation for primarily focusing on incorporating information into the sample size re - estimation based on unblinded data instead of blinded data are of computational nature .",
    "we then elaborate on why the findings for unblinded data are qualitatively the same as for incorporating information into the sample size re - estimation based on blinded data . incorporating external information in form of a prior distribution into nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation",
    "has already been proposed for binomial data in the early 1990s but not studied intensively .",

    "the performance characteristics of the introduced sample size re - estimation procedures incorporating external data are studied in section [ sec : simulation ] . in section [ sec : blinded ] we discuss how prior information can be incorporated into the sample size re - estimation with blinded data and why the performance of the resulting procedures are qualitatively identical to the performance of the procedures based on unblinded data .",
    "we conclude by discussing the findings with particular emphasis on the inappropriateness of incorporating prior information into the nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation .",
    "this section is split into three parts . in the first part we outline the statistical model considered in this manuscript and the classical frequentist approach of sample size planning . in the second part we recapitulate map priors .",

    "@xcite in the following , we give a brief introduction to the map approach for variances .",
    "the idea is to perform a random effects meta - analysis using a normal bayesian hierarchical model for the logarithm of the variance .",

    "the unknown true variance of trial @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "considering that we are focusing on clinical trials with normal data , we assume that the sample variances follow a @xmath36-distribution in the sense @xmath37 we note that the @xmath36-distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and it follows that @xmath38 a random variable following a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath39 and rate parameter @xmath40 , @xmath41 , has mean @xmath42 and variance @xmath43 . to gather information about the variance @xmath44 of a new , to be planned clinical trial from the variances of historical clinical trial , the variance @xmath44 and the variances @xmath45 of historical clinical trials have to be linked .",
    "as it is common in random effects meta - analyses , we assume that the variances origin from the sample distribution by assuming that the log - transformed variances @xmath46 follow a normal distribution , @xmath47 the random effects meta - analysis can be performed using a bayesian hierarchical model . thereto , prior distributions for the mean @xmath48 and the between - trial standard deviation @xmath49 have to be selected .",
    "common choices are weakly informed priors such as a normal distribution with a large variance for the mean and a half - normal distribution for the standard deviation.@xcite the posterior density @xmath50 can not be calculated analytically . however ,",
    "through markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) computations random samples of the parameter vector @xmath51 can be generated .",
    "the random numbers for @xmath52 can then be transformed to obtain random numbers for the posterior predictive distribution of the variance of a new trial @xmath53 .",
    "the posterior predictive distribution of @xmath53 is the map prior for the variance .",
    "the map prior for the variance does in general not have a closed form expression but , as every prior distribution , it can be approximated by a mixture of conjugated priors .",
    "@xcite for the sake of convenience , the prior of the precision @xmath54 , and not the prior of the variance @xmath8 , is approximated by a mixture of conjugated priors . for a normal model ,",
    "the conjugated prior of the precision is the gamma distribution .",
    "therefore , in this manuscript we assume that the prior distribution for the precision @xmath54 is a mixture of gamma distributions @xmath55 the parameters @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are obtained by calculating the maximum - likelihood estimators from the mcmc random sample of @xmath58 . for details on the methodological background of the map approach and its use to summarize historical information on the variance , we refer to schmidli et al .",

    "the methods for including prior information into the nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation which we will present in the next section follow the sample principles . to plan the sample size @xmath22 of a new trial based on the map prior @xmath68 of the variance @xmath8 , a bayes estimator of @xmath8",

    "the sample size can also be planned based on prior information on the standard deviation @xmath71 or on the precision @xmath72 .",

    "when the sample size is determined based on a location parameter of the map prior , the uncertainty of the prior information is not considered in the planning process .",
    "alternative approaches which consider the variability of the prior information can either choose percentiles of the map prior in equation or base the sample size on the expected power .",
    "the unconditional power concerning @xmath8 is the function @xmath73 the total sample size @xmath22 for testing the hypothesis @xmath12 which is then defined by @xmath74 it is worth emphasizing that the sample size obtained from the expected power is in general different to the sample size obtained with formula .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the general idea of nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation in designs with internal pilot study and then propose methods which incorporate prior information on the variance in the form of map priors into the sample size re - estimation .",
    "as the name implies , in nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation the sample size is altered after the internal pilot study based on an estimate of the nuisance parameter .",
    "the estimation of the nuisance parameter can either be done based on blinded or unblinded data . from a regulatory perspective",
    "it must be addressed whether and how the blindness during the sample size re - estimation was maintained , confer section 4.4 of ich guideline e9 .",
    "@xcite other regulatory publications recommend blinded sample size re - estimation whenever possible , such as a reflection paper by the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) .",
    "@xcite the recommended method for sample size re - estimation in two - arm parallel group trials with continuous data is the blinded one - sample variance estimator which estimates the unknown variance by the sample variance of the blinded data .",
    "@xcite the one - sample variance estimator results in a sample size re - estimation procedure which meets the power and controls the type i error rate for practically relevant internal pilot study sizes . although the one - sample variance estimator is the recommended method for nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation , we first introduce the sample size re - estimation incorporating prior information for unblinded data .",
    "the primary reason is that unblinding of the internal pilot study leads to closed form expressions for the sample size re - estimation incorporating external information .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : blinded ] that the performance of the sample size re - estimation procedure incorporation prior information based on blinded data is qualitatively the same as for the procedure relying on unblinded data . altering the sample size of an ongoing clinical trial based on unblinded data from an internal pilot study",
    "has first been proposed by wittes et al.@xcite in detail , the idea is to perform an internal pilot study of size @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 denoting the group specific sample sizes within the internal pilot study . after the outcome measure of the @xmath75 patients",
    "is obtained , the pooled variances @xmath78 from the unblinded data is calculated .",
    "the sample size is then re - estimated based on the estimate @xmath78 using equation .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the re - estimated sample size . here , we consider the final sample size of the clinical trial to be the maximum of the re - estimated sample size and the internal pilot study sample size , i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite alternatively , the final sample size can be set to be the maximum of the initially planned sample size and the re - estimated sample size in which case the sample size re - estimation would not be able to reduce the initially set sample size .",
    "@xcite in the case of constrained resources it can also be reasonable to additionally include an upper limit for the final sample size .",
    "@xcite sample size re - estimation based on the pooled sample variance is able to adjust for a misspecified variance during the planning of the clinical trial if the internal pilot study is reasonably sized .",
    "@xcite this sample size re - estimation approach inflates the type i error rate and due to the unblinding might trigger the need of an independent data monitoring committee ( idmc ) to preserve the blindness of the study personnel .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the type i error rate inflation can be minimized when a bias correction is applied to the variance estimator in the test statistic at the end of the trial .",
    "@xcite we do not apply this bias correction here because it qualitatively does not change the performance of the sample size re - estimation procedure incorporating prior information .",
    "+ when the sample size of a clinical trial is planned utilizing prior information or in general when prior information on the nuisance parameter is available , it seems intuitive to incorporated said prior information into the sample size re - estimation .",
    "we propose to incorporate prior information on the nuisance parameter into the sample size re - estimation by updating the prior using the data from the internal pilot study and then re - calculating the sample size with based on a bayes estimator of the variance obtained from the posterior distribution . in more detail , let @xmath0 be the random variable modeling observation @xmath81 in group @xmath2 after the internal pilot study and let @xmath54 be the precision .",

    "thus , the sample size re - estimation procedure incorporating prior information using the map prior does not meet the basic performance requirement when the prior data is in conflict with the variance of the ongoing clinical trial .",
    "+ for the last part of this simulation study , we robustify the map prior as introduced above and assess whether the corresponding sample size re - estimation procedure incorporating prior information is robust against prior data conflicts .",
    "we assume that the map prior @xmath68 on the variance has an expected value of @xmath141 while the true variance is @xmath120 .",

    "thereto , we assume an observed pooled variance of one from the internal pilot study , i.e. @xmath149 . the prior information on the variance is the same as the mixture in formula . in figure [ fig : postmean ] the posterior mean of the variance is plotted against the prior probability @xmath65 of a prior data conflict for the prior effective sample sizes @xmath148 as well as the internal pilot study sizes @xmath150 .    .",

    "+ concluding , incorporating prior information into the sample size re - estimation results in a power closer to the target power compared to the sample size re - estimation based on the pooled variance estimator in the case of no prior data conflict .",
    "moreover , the variability of the final sample size also decreases when correct prior information are incorporated into the sample size re - estimation .",

    "the adverse influence of a prior data conflict can be limited , but not corrected , by robustifying the prior information which , however , reduces the benefit of incorporating prior information into the sample size re - estimation in the case of no prior data conflict .",
    "in this section we discuss various ways of incorporating prior information into the blinded sample size re - estimation and we outline why the resulting procedures face the same obstacles as the unblinded procedures in the case of a prior data conflict .",
    "the one - sample variance estimator , which estimates the unknown variance by the sample variance of the blinded data , is the recommended method for sample size re - estimation in two - arm trials with continuous data .",
    "@xcite in contrast to sample size re - estimation based on the unbiased pooled sample variance , sample size re - estimation based on one - sample variance estimator meets the target power due to overestimating the outcome variance .",
    "the relationship between the one - sample variance estimator @xmath151 and the pooled sample variance can be illustrated by the following equation@xcite @xmath152 since simply replacing the pooled variance estimator with the one - sample variance estimator resulted in the desired properties of the sample size re - estimation , it seems natural to proceed similar when incorporating prior information into the sample size re - estimation .",
    "thus , when updating the prior information on the variance the pooled sample variance could be replaced by the one - sample variance estimator . doing so increases the power of the sample size re - estimation procedure incorporating prior information . in simulations",
    "not presented here we observed that in the case of a prior data conflict the power increase is small compared to the deviations to the target power and that the prior information are not discounted enough to actually obtain a suitable procedure for incorporating prior information into the sample size re - estimation .",
    "+ an alternative method for blinded sample size re - estimation in two - arm trials with a randomized block design is based on the xing - ganju variance estimator which estimates the outcome variance blinded based on the block sums .",
    "@xcite sample size re - estimation incorporating prior information can be extended to not require unblinding by focusing on the likelihood of the block sums when updating the prior information . in more detail , let @xmath40 be the number of randomized blocks and let @xmath153 be the number of observations within each block . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume equal allocation between treatment arms within each block .",
    "conditioned on the means @xmath154 and @xmath155 and the variance @xmath8 , the block sums @xmath156 , @xmath157 , are normally distributed , @xmath158 thus , @xmath159 follows conditionally a normal distribution with mean @xmath160 and variance @xmath8 . in section [ sec : ssr ] we considered improper uniform priors for the means . from this assumption",
    "follows that the prior for the sum of means is also an improper uniform prior .",
    "the formulas for updating a gamma mixture prior for the precision can be easily adapted from section [ sec : ssr ] by using the xing - ganju estimator @xmath161 instead of the pooled variance estimator and noting that the degrees of freedom are @xmath162 instead of @xmath163 .",
    "that being said , the similarity of the models also implies that the performance of the resulting sample size re - estimation procedures incorporating prior information will be very similar to the case of the unblinded sample size re - estimation with prior information .",
    "the lower number of degrees of freedom of the xing - ganju variance estimator further reduces the ability to discount prior information in the case of a prior data conflict , too .",
    "thus , blinded sample size re - estimation incorporating prior information based on the xing - ganju variance estimator will not achieve the target power .",
    "+ the blinded data from the internal pilot study follow a mixture of two normal distributions .",
    "therefore , it has been studied to estimate the variance for the blinded sample size re - estimation using the expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm .",
    "@xcite however , the variance estimator from the em algorithm is biased downwards resulting in a sample size re - estimation procedure underpowering clinical trials . when updating the prior information on the variance after the internal pilot study using the likelihood of a mixture of normal distributions , similar effects can be observed .",
    "the posterior distribution for the variance has a mean and median smaller than the pooled variance .",
    "thus , considering those location parameters in the sample size re - estimation does also result in underpowering the clinical trial .",
    "+ concluding , prior information can easily be incorporated into the blinded sample size re - estimation .",
    "however , similar to the unblinded sample size re - estimation incorporating prior information , in the case of a prior data conflict the prior data can not be discounted enough to ensure that the resulting sample size re - estimation procedure results in an clinical trial meeting the target power .",
    "in this manuscript we studied various methods for incorporating prior information on the nuisance parameter into nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation .",
    "the prior information was given as an map prior which is obtained through a meta - analysis of variances from historical clinical trials using a bayesian hierarchical model .",
    "in the case of no prior data conflict , that is when the prior mean corresponds to the true variance of the ongoing clinical trial , incorporating prior information into the sample size re - estimation decreases the variability of the final sample size distribution compared to the unblinded sample size re - estimation based on the pooled sample variance .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the unblinded sample size re - estimation procedure , the sample size re - estimation procedure incorporating prior information meets the nominal power when the prior information is correct . however , the sample size re - estimation approach incorporating prior information is not robust to prior data conflicts which leads to under- or overpowered clinical trials when the variance of the ongoing trial differs from the historically observed variances . robustifying the map prior",
    "does improve the performance of the sample size re - estimation approach incorporating prior data , however , not to the point where the clinical trials are not under- or overpowered .",
    "this is due to the internal pilot studies not containing enough information to discount the misspecified prior information of the nuisance parameter .",
    "the performance of sample size re - estimation incorporating prior information was primarily studied for unblinded data even though blinded sample size re - estimation is in general recommended .",
    "that being said , we proposed several approaches to incorporate prior information into the blinded sample size re - estimation and we exemplified that the resulting blinded sample size re - estimation procedures incorporating prior information do not meet the target power either when a prior data conflict is present . concluding , incorporating prior information into the nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation can be beneficial in the sense that it reduces the variability of the re - estimated sample size compared to the sample size re - estimation without prior information .",
    "however , incorporating prior information into the nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation also bears the risk of resulting in an under- or overpowered clinical trial when a prior data conflict is present .",
    "this risk is not present in the traditional nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation which generally meets the target power .",
    "+ hartley studied blinded sample size re - estimation for normal data and concluded that incorporating prior information into the blinded sample size re - estimation is generally recommended .",
    "@xcite it is worth highlighting the differences between hartley s publication and our manuscript since we draw a different conclusion . in hartley",
    "s publication , prior information on both the variance and the effect are incorporated into the sample size re - estimation which selects the final sample size based on a predictive power .",
    "in contrast , we did not consider uncertainty in the effect size and we studied the setting where the final sample size is determined based on the sample size formula for student s _ t_-test as it is common in nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation for a frequentist analysis at the end of the clinical trial .",
    "moreover , in this manuscript we focused on the overarching approach of both summarizing the prior information based on the map approach and incorporating the gathered prior information into the nuisance parameter based sample size re - estimation .",
    "we also extensively studied the case of prior data conflicts which eventually lead to our conclusion to not recommend sample size re - estimation based on prior information .",
