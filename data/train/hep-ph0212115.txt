    "future linear colliders are expected to reveal the answers to many questions of modern particle physics .",
    "one of these concerns the the physics of the higgs particle and origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the neutral scalar higgs boson is an important ingredient of the standard model ( sm ) and is the only sm elementary particle which has not been detected so far ( see for a review @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath7 of approximately @xmath8 gev at @xmath9 c.l . has been obtained from direct searches at lep @xcite .",
    "current experiments are concentrating on the possibility of finding a higgs particle in the intermediate mass region @xmath10 in this region it decays mainly to a @xmath11 pair .",
    "the _ photon mode _ of the future linear collider ( lc ) , namely the collisions of the energetic polarized compton photons , will be used for the production and for the study of the higgs particle . in the intermediate mass range ,",
    "the main production process is @xmath12 qcd as well as electroweak radiative corrections to this process have been studied very well and have been found to be small in this region @xcite .",
    "the main challenge , however , is to get under control the background process @xmath13 which gets extremely large qcd corrections .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the process of the quark anti - quark production in the photon mode of the lc , @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude for this process in the scalar channel contains large double logarithms at @xmath14 . at very high energies ,",
    "the large logarithms spoil the perturbative predictions .",
    "therefore it is mandatory to develop a clear resummation procedure for this double and single logarithmic terms .",
    "let us stress , that the main interest in the process @xmath0 comes from the fact ( but is not limited to it ) that it represents the dominant background for the production of the higgs particle , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in fact , our motivations for this study are twofold : + ( 1 ) a detailed study of the process @xmath0 is very important due to phenomenological reasons mentioned above ; and + ( 2 ) in addition to that , the quark anti - quark production in photon collisions , being one of the simplest process in qcd , is important in its own right , e.g. for studying and understanding qcd effects .",
    "the born cross section for the polarized @xmath16 production in the scalar channel ( at @xmath17 ) , where the higgs will be studied as well , is suppressed by @xmath18 @xcite , ( here @xmath19 is the center of mass energy of the initial photons ) .",
    "however , the perturbative qcd corrections contains the large double logarithms of the form @xmath20 , which give a contribution to the cross section which is of the same order as the born contribution at high energies .",
    "the presence of the large correction was noticed by jikia in @xcite . the double logarithmic nature and the origin of these corrections",
    "were studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors studied the process to one and two loop accuracy .",
    "later , the form of the resummed results for the double logarithms has been argued in @xcite .",
    "these authors also claimed that the double logarithms have a``non - sudakov '' origin .    in this paper",
    ", we first present an alternative way of understanding the resummation procedure for the double logarithms .",
    "the general idea of our approach , is that the only source of double logarithms is the off - shell sudakov form factor included in the triangle topologies of the one - loop box diagram .",
    "we have proved that the other types of the higher loop diagrams will either cancel in subgroups or develop a universal on - shell sudakov exponent due to the final quark anti - quark lines .",
    "in addition to that , ( 1 ) we extend this analysis to the next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , and ( 2 ) we study the mechanism of cancellations alluded to above , between the different diagrams which leads to very simple resummed results .",
    "we demonstrate the cancellation explicitly at three loops and point out the mechanism responsible which then allows for the generalization to higher loops , all up to the next to leading logarithmic accuracy . as an aside",
    ", we argue that all the large logarithms up to the next to leading level are related to the sudakov ones .",
    "this includes not only the leading ones of the form @xmath1 but also the next to leading ones of the form @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the quark mass ) .",
    "it is this fact together with an understanding of the cancellation mechanism which allows us to develop an easy resummation procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2.1",
    "we discuss the one loop diagrams and explain which topologies are important .",
    "in section 2.2 we present a procedure for the resummation of the double logarithms . in section 2.3",
    "we extend our analysis to the next - to - leading logarithmic level . in this section",
    "we consider all possible topologies and give the final result of the resummation .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the different cancellations which are responsible for the simple resummed results of section 2.2 for the double logarithmic case . in section 4",
    "we tackle the case of the form factors to the next to leading logarithmic accuracy and justify the results given in section 2.3 .",
    "the paper ends with some conclusions and discussions .",
    "we study the process of quark anti - quark pair production in photon - photon collisions @xmath21 in the scalar channel @xmath17 , at very high energies compared to the mass of the quark @xmath3 , and at large scattering angles @xmath22 the radiative corrections to this helicity amplitude contain large double and single qcd logarithms of the form @xmath23 , in the limit eq.([lim1],[lim2 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the large double logarithms ( dl ) have a sudakov - like nature and can be extracted from the total result by identifying special kinematic regions . it was demonstrated that , only the box diagram contributes , and that this box diagram can be reduced to three different effective diagrams with triangle topology .",
    "we label them as topologies a , b , c following @xcite , see fig.([topologies ] ) .",
    "these effective diagrams result from the box diagram when one of the four propagators is hard , two collinear and one soft ( the soft line can be either the gluon or the quark propagator ) . hence one can shrink the hard propagator of the box diagram to a point , because it does not depend on the soft loop momenta anymore",
    ". the hard momenta would be just an ultra violet cutoff in this situation .    in order to introduce notations and to get an idea about the structure of the dl ,",
    "let us consider one loop calculations in the dl approximation .",
    "also , we will use these results in the next section for the construction of the dl - resummed result .",
    "as is well known , the double logarithms come from the region of soft loop momenta . hence , one can always write a factorized form for the amplitude in the dl approximation : @xmath24 the factor 2 in the last equation represents two identical contributions @xmath25 of the topology c. the amplitude then reads @xmath26 we turn now to the calculation of the form factors @xmath27 .",
    "it is convenient to use the standard sudakov technique for calculating dl contributions , as described in @xcite , and introduce sudakov parameterization @xcite .",
    "one starts with decomposing the soft momenta in terms of those along the hard external momenta , for example @xmath28 and transverse to them @xmath29 the dl contribution comes only from the region @xmath30 for different topologies it is convenient to use different decompositions of the soft momenta : @xmath31 the loop integration in terms of the new variables reads @xmath32 the integration over the transverse momenta of the soft quark is performed by taking half of the residues in the corresponding propagator , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a small ( fictitious ) gluon mass . in this manner",
    "the one loop amplitude may be calculated in the dl approximation and topology a gives , @xmath35 topology b and c have following form at one loop in the dl approximation @xmath36 these results were derived first in @xcite and will be used in our calculation later on .",
    "the main idea behind our method is that the only origin of the double logarithms is the off - shell sudakov form factor included in the effective one loop triangle diagrams a , b and c. contributions from other types of diagrams will either cancel in subgroups or develop a simple on - shell sudakov exponent due to the final quark anti - quark pair . the cancellations amongst the diagrams will be discussed in the next section where the general mechanism is elucidated . here",
    "we study the dl resummation in the topologies a , b and c.    the diagrams of topology a represent a simple case .",
    "here we do not have any `` hard '' dls , but only the `` soft '' ones , which develop the usual on - shell sudakov form factor from the gluon exchanges between the final quark antiquark pair .",
    "it is well known , that the on - shell dl sudakov form factor in qcd is the exponent of the one loop result @xmath37 with @xmath38 given in eq.([1loopa ] ) .",
    "the resummation of the dl terms coming from the diagrams of topology b is more involved .",
    "first , we have to account for the `` soft '' on - shell exponent from the final quark antiquark re - scattering , similar to the one in topology a , eq.([topa ] ) .",
    "second , we observe a new element , namely the `` hard '' double logarithms from quark anti - quark re - scattering inside the one loop diagram .",
    "the interacting particles ( quarks in this case ) are hard and slightly off - shell , @xmath39 .    according to our general idea",
    ", the resummation of the `` hard '' dl can be obtained by including the off - shell sudakov form factor into the loop , and accounting only for those momenta which do not destroy the dl nature of the one loop result .",
    "we recall that the off - shell sudakov form factor , is a vertex of the production of the quark and anti - quark with small virtualities @xmath40 and @xmath41 and has a form @xcite @xmath42 assuming that @xmath43 now the momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 become loop momenta , i.e.,they depend on @xmath46 @xmath47 because of the dl approximation , the kinematic region of interest is restricted by the inequalities @xmath48 taking into account the result eq.([sudb ] ) and including it into eq.([1loopb ] ) we get @xmath49 we next transform the exponent into a power series and find that the integral of the @xmath50th term will be of the form @xmath51 the final result at dl accuracy reads @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the index @xmath54 shows that the order of the amplitude is @xmath55 .",
    "we can clearly identify the separate contributions of the fixed orders in @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath57 is large all terms in the series are important , giving altogether some analytic function @xmath58 .",
    "this function is identified with a hyper - geometric function @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 these functions are exact answers in @xmath61 in the dl approximation . for large values of the parameter @xmath62 the function",
    "@xmath63 has the following asymptotic , @xmath64 thus we see that despite the fact that perturbation theory blows up at large @xmath61 , the resummed result gives a smooth well defined function .",
    "topology c differs from b only through the color structure at the dl level . at the end of the calculations the answers for topologies",
    "b and c are similar and are related by the simple substitution : @xmath65 combining all results for the three topologies we have @xmath66 with the functions defined above .",
    "we must stress that there are other diagrams which can give dl contributions .",
    "fortunately , all of them cancel in the certain groups , as will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "this cancellation has a very simple physical interpretation ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "our results are written in two different representations .",
    "we have checked that they are in agreement with @xcite , where the authors used a completely different method , not mentioning the off - shell sudakov form factors at all .",
    "we believe that our approach is more transparent .",
    "it shows that the new double logarithms are of sudakov type , and , therefore , the resummation procedure becomes simple .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that it opens up the possibility for resumming the single logarithms as well .",
    "it is possible to develop this approach to achieve next - to - leading - logarithmic accuracy .",
    "first , the factorization formula should be modified in order to take into account single logarithms .",
    "the amplitude reads at nll approximation @xmath67 with the function @xmath68 which can be extracted from the explicit calculations performed in @xcite by expanding the result at @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is the on - shell sudakov form factor to the next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy @xcite .",
    "second , in order to calculate the form factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 at nll , we need an expression for the sudakov form factor also to this accuracy .",
    "we turn now to the calculation of the form factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , such an analysis already exists in the literature @xcite for the case when the two external fermion lines are off - shell by the same amount , i.e. , @xmath73 : @xmath74 for our purposes , we need to extend the analysis to take into account that @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to see that for the region , eq.([lim1 ] ) , the proof of factorization and exponentiation given in @xcite goes through with straightforward changes .",
    "the major change involves the normalization of the coupling .",
    "we have studied one and two loop diagrams for the @xmath76 production vertex with slightly off - shell quarks with the following result : @xmath77 with the normalization of the coupling constant determined to be @xmath78 .",
    "we show only the double and single ir logarithms in the exponent of eq.([slresult ] ) .    in order to understand this normalization",
    ", we have to consider the diagram shown in fig.[rge ]    where we keep track of the @xmath79 dependent pieces only since they are separately gauge invariant .",
    "such diagrams can be accounted for by considering the following gluon propagator @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the vacuum polarization by the gluon ; at the one loop level it is simply @xmath82 , @xmath83 being a scheme - dependent constant ( @xmath84 scheme @xmath85 ) .",
    "the diagram , fig.[rge ] , corresponds to the first term in the expansion of the gluon propagator in @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath79part of this result is as mentioned earlier a gauge invariant subset of the complete set of two loop diagrams .",
    "because the effects of the running coupling gives only single logarithmic terms it is enough to consider the remaining integrals to dl accuracy .",
    "namely , we may trace only the terms proportional to @xmath86 from fig.[rge ] . at the dl",
    "accuracy the spin structure of the amplitude is simple , so that one needs to consider the scalar integral only , @xmath87 to evaluate this , we consider a slightly more general integral @xmath88 which after expanding in @xmath89 will give us the desired integral @xmath90 . using feynman parameters , this integral is reduced to @xmath91,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 the function @xmath93 has two zeros , @xmath94 : @xmath95 for very small virtualities , @xmath96 , the roots are simplified to @xmath97 . expanding the integrand of @xmath98 in @xmath89 up to second order we have @xmath99 \\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final integration over @xmath100 is simple , the result is @xmath101 we see , that the first term in this equation reproduces the dl result from eq.([sudb ] ) and eq.([slresult ] ) .",
    "it can be checked , that the second term suggests the normalization of the coupling constant to be , @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , returning to the integral @xmath90 , we find @xmath103.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that the last logarithm , containing the @xmath104 term , can be absorbed into the running coupling , giving @xmath105 with the normalization point @xmath106 .",
    "the exponentiation of the integral @xmath90 will give us the final off - shell sudakov exponent , eq.([slresult ] ) .    in order to get single logarithms in eq.([slresult ] ) we have to include the numerator and the spin structure .",
    "we do not present the details of these calculations here .",
    "instead we note , that all logarithms we have accounted for are of infrared origin , @xmath107 .",
    "we do not show the uv logarithms which come as a result of the renormalization of the quark mass .",
    "such terms can be omitted if the quark mass in the leading order result is normalized at a large scale @xmath108 .",
    "the formula eq.([slresult ] ) reproduces the expression for the sudakov form factor at non - equal virtualities at dl accuracy derived by carrazone et .",
    "al . in @xcite , eq.([sudb ] ) , as well as at nll with equal virtualities @xmath109 derived by smilga in @xcite , eq.([smilga ] ) .",
    "in addition , the normalization point @xmath102 that we find reproduces that of the nll results with equal virtualities @xmath109 derived by smilga in @xcite , eq.([smilga ] ) .",
    "this scale , @xmath102 , has a very transparent origin .",
    "the vertex of the interaction of a soft gluon with an off - shell quark ( @xmath40 ) is described by the coupling @xmath110 . in the situation of gluon - exchange between two quarks with different virtualities",
    ", we have an effective coupling @xmath111 .",
    "using the running of the coupling @xmath112 , at one loop level , @xmath113 , we will find that the effective coupling @xmath111 is reduced to @xmath114 , which coincides with our previous results .    as a next step ,",
    "we include this form factor inside the one loop triangle diagram and calculate the last loop integration with the form factor which now accounts for all large logarithms to nll accuracy .",
    "the final result for the next - to - leading - logarithmic form factor reads @xmath115 with @xmath116 from eq.([dlresult ] ) and @xmath117 with @xmath118 , @xmath79 is the number of light flavors @xcite .",
    "topology c at nll gives a slightly different result . in the previous section where we have already studied the dl",
    "result , we saw that the `` hard '' sudakov form factor is developed as a result of the re - scattering of a hard quark on the hard gluon .",
    "let us start with the sudakov form factor for the quark - gluon vertex with an off - shell outgoing quark of virtuality @xmath40 and a gluon of virtuality @xmath41 .",
    "the result for the reduced form factor is @xmath119 where the coefficient @xmath120 is related to the wave function renormalization of the gluon .",
    "now we can obtain a resummed result by substituting this form factor in the known one loop integral of topology c. the dl result coincides with that of topology b ( as we discussed previously , after accounting for the substitution @xmath121 ) .",
    "the result for next - to - leading - logarithmic form factor reads @xmath122 the final result for the amplitude is eq.([ampnll ] ) together with eq.([rep1],[finalb],[finalc ] ) .",
    "that concludes our derivation of the nll form factors .",
    "we emphasize that throughout this subsection we have taken into account all logarithms of the sudakov type only . in section 4",
    "we argue that to the nll level this is justified because of cancellations between diagrams that is similar to the dl case . in other words , logarithms of the nll type coming from other sources (",
    "than the sudakov form factors ) cancel between contributions of subsets of diagrams .",
    "the simple expressions for the resummed results given in the previous section are a consequence of the cancellation of double logarithmic terms which are not of the sudakov type .",
    "in fact for the exponentiation to work there has to be a large number of cancellations between subgroups of diagrams .",
    "such cancellations have been discussed in the literature explicitly at the two loop @xcite and the three loop levels @xcite .",
    "we agree with the results of these papers however the new element we would like to add here is to point out the general mechanism which is responsible for these cancellations .",
    "we discuss this mechanism on various examples and write down identities which guarantee the cancellations to higher loop orders .",
    "the relevant cancellations at the double logarithmic level are due to a single mechanism - the dipole mechanism .",
    "two fermions with opposite charges form a dipole when separated by a short distance .",
    "when observing from far away , or probing by means of a gluon with long wavelength , one finds the dipole system to be neutral to leading order . to be more specific , the total amplitude for exchanging a soft gluon with two such oppositely charged fermions , as shown by the sum of the two generic feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ generic ] ) , vanishes in the infrared sensitive region ( double and single logarithms ) .",
    "this infrared sensitive region is that of a soft gluon , i.e. , a gluon with all components of the 4-momentum small , @xmath123 , @xmath124 this soft region is responsible for the double logarithms .",
    "the cancellation can be shown explicitly by employing the grammar - yennie @xcite decomposition and the ward identity.to illustrate the mechanism let us consider a special case shown in , fig .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) .",
    "the amplitude for the first diagram is @xmath125 where we have explicitly written down only the factors relevant for the cancellation and denoted the rest of the corresponding expressions for the diagram by @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "their explicit form are of no interest as long as they are common to both the diagrams , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . employing the grammar - yennie decomposition we write for the gauge boson propagator , @xmath130 and keep only the term @xmath131 , i.e.",
    ", we make the replacement @xmath132 which leaves the infrared behavior unchanged @xcite , we obtain @xmath133[(k_1-l - k)^2-m^2 ] }      \\gamma_2 u(p_1 ) \\frac{1}{k^2(p_1 \\cdot k)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have applied the ward identity on the outgoing fermion line . summing the two diagrams together",

    "this can be readily seen in the expansion @xmath145 ^ 2      + \\left[\\frac{p_{1\\bot } \\cdot k_{\\bot}}{(\\beta + \\alpha)\\frac{s}{2}}\\right]^4+\\cdots\\right\\},\\ ] ] since the odd terms in @xmath140 vanish when integrating over the angle between @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "further , @xmath148^{2n } = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } 2^n \\left ( \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha } \\right)^n \\frac{p_{1\\bot}^{2n}}{s^n } \\cos^{2n}\\theta & \\alpha \\gg \\beta \\\\ \\\\ 2^n \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{(\\alpha+\\beta)^2 } \\right]^n   \\frac{p_{1\\bot}^{2n}}{s^n } \\cos^{2n}\\theta & \\alpha \\sim \\beta \\\\ \\\\ 2^n \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta } \\right)^n \\frac{p_{1\\bot}^{2n}}{s^n } \\cos^{2n}\\theta & \\beta \\gg \\alpha \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and power suppression arises from the term @xmath149 with @xmath150 , @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 for all the three cases .",
    "thus we have seen that the two diagrams indeed cancel each other in the double logarithmic approximation .",
    "the explicit calculation is applicable to the generic diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) if we recall that what really matters here is nothing but the exchange of the soft gluon with the fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "the same conclusion holds for a exchanging collinear gluon in the single logarithm approximation as we will discuss later .",
    "we will next discuss how the dipole mechanism for cancellation works in certain 3 loop examples .",
    "more specifically , we will show the cancellation of double logarithms in the diagrams @xmath154 of topology c. for simplicity of presentation we first discuss only the abelian case omitting all group theory factors and in the next section the extension to the non - abelian case will be presented .",

    ", we have shown that all diagrams @xmath212 cancel in group of two or three due to the dipole mechanism .",
    "the inclusion of the non - abelian contributions do not pose any new difficulties .",
    "in fact , there are many simplifications because the final state quark and antiquark are produced by photons and hence carry no net color charge .",
    "when the color factors are included the cancellations take place between diagrams with the same such factors .",

    "@xmath161 and @xmath162 have the same group factor since the only difference between them is an abelian vertex .",
    "the same is true for group 2 .",
    "thus the cancellation between the diagrams of groups 1 and 2 proceed as in the previous section even in the full non - abelian theory .",
    "consider next , group 3 of the previous subsection .",
    "for this case we will discuss the cancellation in two different ways . in the first method we note",
    "that only the group theory factor for the diagram @xmath213 is different from that of @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath213 the factor is @xmath216 while for the other two it is @xmath217 .",
    "all other factors are the same as in the previous section with the rule that the group factors are overall multiplicative .",
    "in particular , the sub - diagrams @xmath218 contain no color matrices .",
    "now we can write the color factor of @xmath213 as the one for @xmath214 and @xmath215 plus a left over term which is @xmath219 .",
    "consider now the diagrams in group 4 of the previous section . here",
    "the group factor associated with @xmath220 is @xmath217 which is different from @xmath221 and @xmath222 which is @xmath223 .",
    "the difference now is @xmath224 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath225 we see that the left over pieces from groups 3 and 4 cancel each other out .",
    "it is easy to check that the same applies to the combination of groups 5 and 6 .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion , that it is much more straightforward in the non abelian case to change the assignment of the diagrams into different groups .",
    "it is easy to see that apart from the group theory factors , and in the soft approximation , the diagrammatic expressions for @xmath213 and @xmath220 of the previous subsection ( from groups 3 and 4 ) are the same ( using of course @xmath225 ) . from groups 5 and 6 of the previous subsection",
    "the same applies to the expressions for @xmath226 and @xmath227 ( in this case using @xmath228 ) .",
    "thus the following assignment of the diagrams in the non - abelian case into different groups will make sure that all diagrams in a group have the same group theoretical factors :    1 .",

    "@xmath231 5 .",

    "@xmath233    the new assignment does not change the results for the abelian case and now the cancellation in the non - abelian case proceeds within each group .",
    "the only non - trivial result one must use is the equalities @xmath225 and @xmath228 .",
    "these are always seen to be true in the soft approximation . in the present grouping ,",
    "the diagrams in each group are seen to be related to each other by a cyclic permutation of the gluon lines .",
    "such a cyclic permutation leaves the color factor unchanged .",
    "the cancellation between the other non abelian diagrams shown in fig.[nonab ] also proceeds similarly : for example , @xmath234 cancels @xmath235 ; @xmath236 cancels @xmath237 and so on .",
    "this discussion now has been set up for generalization to all orders .",
    "we see that the cancellation at the 3 loop level discussed in the previous subsection relies on the following : ( 1 ) the soft approximation,(2 ) algebraic identities like @xmath238 and that diagrams in the same group are related by a cyclic permutation of the gluon lines . in the above",
    ", @xmath239 is a generic hard momentum and @xmath240 are the soft ones .",
    "the soft approximation essentially tells us that a soft gluon does not see spin and more explicitly if @xmath239 generically denotes a hard fermion momentum then we can consistently use,@xmath241 for the hard propagator and @xmath242 for the vertex factors .",
    "this will ensure the equalities like @xmath225 needed for the cancellations to occur for our process .",
    "as far as the algebraic identities are concerned , they are in fact special cases of the sterman - libby identities @xcite .",
    "these identities obtained by considering diagrams related by cyclic permutations of the gluon lines read in general : @xmath243 in the above , @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "these identities are easily seen to reduce to eqs.([id_dl ] ) for the cases @xmath246 .",
    "thus we see each of the technical ingredients have a generalization to higher loop orders .",
    "the physics of the dipole mechanism and the color singlet nature of the final ( and initial ) states combined with the above guarantee the cancellations needed to all orders .",
    "the goal of this section is to identify those diagrams that either vanish or cancel some other diagrams at next - to - leading logarithmic order .",
    "the diagrams left over are then just those needed in the discussion in section 2.3 .",
    "our explicit analysis is only at the two loop level and at the end we argue that the results hold to nll accuracy . in the first subsection",
    ", we discuss the regime contributing to the next - to - leading logarithms .",
    "we then introduce a power counting technique that enables us to discover the non - vanishing diagrams and make appropriate approximations .",
    "armed with these two techniques , we are able to exclude a set of diagrams without actually carrying out the loop integrations .",
    "we remind the reader that we work throughout in the feynman gauge . in this gauge",
    "we will see that for the process under consideration , the additional logarithms at the nll level must be of collinear origin .      in a two - particle scattering process ,",
    "all momenta lie in the same plane .",
    "we can take two of the independent momenta , @xmath247 and @xmath248 , as + and - direction , and denote the third momentum as @xmath239 ( @xmath239 could be either @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "the loop momentum @xmath249 can be expressed in terms of light cone variables @xmath250    we note that the following integral in the soft regime @xmath251 gives terms like @xmath252 , @xmath253 or @xmath254 . in other words , the soft regime can not give rise to a single logarithm at the one - loop level .",
    "consider an n - loop feynman integral with loop momenta @xmath255 .",
    "we can decompose @xmath256 in terms of external momenta @xmath247 and @xmath248 , @xmath257 in the soft region , @xmath258 , the feynman integral does not give the next - to - leading logarithm , @xmath259 .",
    "this is because , intuitively , each integration over the light cone variables @xmath260 and @xmath261 gives either a logarithm or a power suppression , as exemplified in the previous paragraph .",
    "we now prove this statement more rigorously .",
    "we first note the following replacement for loop momenta corresponding to a soft line , @xmath262    the rest of the propagators can be categorized into hard , collinear and soft ones .",
    "the hard propagators are irrelevant to the infrared sensitivity .",
    "the remaining possibilities are collinear to @xmath247 or @xmath248 , soft or collinear to @xmath239 . we discuss them in turn .",

    "again , the bosonic propagator can be expanded as @xmath271 \\label{col - p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fermionic propagator may give rise to an additional @xmath272 in the numerator .",
    "first , we only include the first term in the series in eq.([soft ] , [ col - p ] ) and apply the following trick @xmath273 this trick reduces the number of different combinations of @xmath260 s and @xmath261 s while splitting one term into two .",
    "therefore , when the propagators in case ( 1 ) and only the first terms in the expansions of the soft and collinear - to-@xmath239 propagators are included , the integral can be reduced to a finite sum of the type @xmath274 where @xmath275 s represent @xmath260 s , @xmath261 s or the combinations thereof .",
    "it is evident that an integration over each @xmath275 gives either a logarithm or a power suppression @xmath276 .",
    "no next - to - leading logarithm can arise in the soft regime .",
    "we now include the whole series in eq.([soft ] , [ col - p ] ) , as well as their fermionic counterpart whenever appropriate .",
    "the denominators are polynomials of @xmath277 and @xmath278 , @xmath279 the numerators consists of terms proportional to @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "the feynman integral is thus of the following form @xmath282 where @xmath283 and @xmath284 are both polynomial functions of their arguments and the spinor structure is not interesting .",
    "since @xmath285 is the only vector in the integrand which is not the integration variable , the integral of interest can further be reduced to @xmath286 where we have further left out the tensorial structure of @xmath287 and @xmath288 .    by noting @xmath289 where",
    "the angles @xmath290 are relative to the vector @xmath291 , the integral can be cast into @xmath292 where @xmath293 and @xmath294 are polynomial functions of their arguments .",
    "we have used the @xmath143 function ( eq.([delta - func ] ) ) to perform the integration over @xmath295 and implicitly included the resulting @xmath296 functions in the polynomials @xmath293 .",
    "the summation in the second line is due to the expansions in the soft and collinear - to-@xmath239 propagators .",
    "it is a convergent series .",
    "now we examine the arguments of the polynomial @xmath293 in eq.([poly - sqrt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath297 represents various combinations of @xmath277 and @xmath298 that may appear .",
    "for such a combination , we split the integration region @xmath299 after such maniputions , we obtain a convergent series @xmath300 with p and q polynomial functions of @xmath301 and @xmath302 . in order to obtain the next - to - leading logarithm ,",
    "@xmath303 of the integrations have to give logarithm while the last one gives a constant of order 1 .",
    "this is impossible for the above integral in the soft region .",
    "it follows that at least one of the loop momenta has to be taken out of soft region to correctly reproduce the next to leading logarithmic behavior in the feynman gauge .      in order to identify the regime contributing to the next - to - leading logarithmic order at two - loop level , we consider inserting a gluon into the one - loop box diagram . from the previous subsection",
    ", we know the inserted gluon has to be collinear .",
    "therefore , we will consider in turn the three topologies with an additional collinear gluon inserted to each of them .    throughout the following subsections ,",
    "we always denote the soft loop momentum by @xmath249 and that of the collinear gluon by @xmath304 .",
    "we take two momenta @xmath239 and @xmath305 as the basis to decompose the momentum @xmath304 of the collinear gluon , @xmath306 the generic momenta @xmath239 and @xmath305 can be any two of the external momenta @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in the so - called collinear region , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath304 parallel to @xmath239 such that @xmath307    in general , all the propagators in a feynman diagram can be characterized as hard ( off - shell ) , soft or collinear ( to a certain direction ) . in order to get the next - to - leading logarithm at two - loop level , which is a double logarithm multiplied with a single logarithm , a feynman diagram has to contain at least four collinear and one soft propagators .",
    "specifically , the double logarithmic form factor arises from a soft virtual particle interacting with two ( nearly ) on - shell particles that are flying apart along two different directions . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction between two collinearly flying virtual particles gives rise to the single logarithmic form factor .    as a result , whenever we have less than four collinear propagators , we can immediately conclude that the feynman diagram does not contribute at the next - to - leading logarithmic level .",
    "when we have exactly four collinear and a soft propagator , we only keep terms proportional to @xmath260 in the numerator . the @xmath261 term can be dropped because it cancels a @xmath261 in the denominator and",
    "effectively removes a collinear propagator .",
    "an example of such a collinear propagator is @xmath308 and when we carry out the integration over @xmath304 , we can pick up a pole from an on - shell propagator as the above one .",
    "it follows that @xmath309 and @xmath310 should also be dropped .",
    "if we get more than four collinear propagators , we will keep all the terms .",
    "however , in general the terms proportional to @xmath260 are suppressed by @xmath311 and thus leave @xmath261 and @xmath310 the leading terms .",
    "when inserting a gluon into a box diagram , we will obtain one - loop vertex subdiagrams inside four of the resulting two - loop diagrams .",
    "two of the vertex corrections each have two legs ( nearly ) on - shell and the other soft .",
    "there is no large scale of order @xmath19 , other than that from the uv cutoff , in such a sub - diagram .",

    "hereafter , we will omit the diagrams ( and regions of diagram ) that give rise to large logarithms only of ultraviolet origin , until we are ready to run the relevant parameters using the rge .",
    "we show some of the diagrams relevant to the next - to - leading logarithms of topology a in fig.[nll_a ] .",

    "note the incoming quark and the outgoing gluon of the hard subprocess @xmath320 are nearly on shell .",
    "in addition , the gluon labeled by @xmath304 in the three diagrams are nearly on - shell too .",
    "we can expect the contributions only proportional to @xmath312 of the three diagrams to cancel to the leading order , in the same manner as discussed earlier in section 3 .    in order to show the cancellation , we decompose @xmath321 each of the three amplitude takes on the form @xmath322 with @xmath323 , @xmath324 , representing amplitudes of fig.([nll_c]a , b , c ) respectively . in this subsection , integrations over @xmath249 and @xmath304 should be understood in the amplitudes .",
