    "the dominant production mechanism at lep for a scalar higgs boson , such as the sm predicts , is the s - channel process @xmath1 . in the mssm ,",
    "the production of the lightest scalar higgs boson , h , proceeds through the same processes as in the sm .",
    "the data from the search for the sm higgs boson also provide information on the h boson . however",
    ", in the mssm the production cross - section is smaller than the sm one and can even vanish in certain regions of the mssm parameter space .",
    "there is also a cp - odd pseudo - scalar , a , which would be produced mostly in the @xmath2 process at lep2 .",
    "this channel is therefore also considered . for mssm parameter values for which single h production is suppressed ,",
    "the associated @xmath3 production is enhanced ( if kinematically permitted ) .    in the @xmath4 channel ,",
    "all known decays of the z boson ( hadrons , charged leptons and neutrinos ) have been taken into account , while the analyses have been optimized for decays of the higgs particle into , making use of the expected high branching fraction of this mode , and for higgs boson decays into a pair of particles , which is the second main decay channel in the sm and in most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the @xmath3 production has been searched for in the two main decay channels , namely the @xmath5 and final states .",
    "the present results are published in  @xcite.the sm higgs limit is improved when combining the four lep experiments to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "a lep combination in the mssm is expected for the coming months .",
    "the statistical procedure to combine the different search channels is a confidence level calculation in two hypothesis : a background only and a background plus signal hypothesis .",
    "confidence levels are calculated using a modified frequentist technique based on the extended maximum likelihood ratio  @xcite which has also been adopted by the lep higgs working group .",
    "the basis of the calculation is the likelihood ratio test - statistic defined using the signal and background densities for each event .",
    "these densities are constructed using two - dimensional discriminant information .",
    "the first variable is the reconstructed higgs boson mass ( or the sum of the reconstructed h and a masses in the @xmath3 channels ) , the second one is channel - dependent .",
    "curves of the confidence level @xmath7 and @xmath8 as a function of the test mass @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sm ] . in the presence of a sizable higgs signal , the value of the observed @xmath7 would approach one , since it measures the fraction of experiments with only background processes which are more background - like than the observation . here",
    "the compatibility between the observation and the expectation from background processes is well within one standard deviation over the range of masses tested .",
    "the observed 95% cl lower limit on the mass is 114.1  @xmath10 while the expected median limit is @xmath11 .",
    "in the benchmark scenarios proposed , a scan was performed over the mssm parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the results come in terms of exclusion ranges as shown in table  [ extab ] . an updated version of the mssm delphi results can be found in  @xcite .              99 j.abdallah _ et al _ , cern - ep/2003 - 008 ( submitted to eur . phys .",
