    "the sine - gordon model in @xmath0 dimensions has attracted interest long time ago for the reason that it appears in several areas of physics , nevertheless it is an integrable field theory , that can be used to study non - perturbative quantum field theory phenomena .",
    "the areas of application include statistical mechanics of one - dimensional quantum spin chains and nonlinear optics among many others  see the introduction of @xcite for a representative list with references .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a non - integrable extension of the sine - gordon model called multi - frequency sine - gordon model , in which the scalar potential consists of several cosine terms with different frequencies .",
    "it is suggested in @xcite that this model can be used to give more refined approximation to some of the physical situations where the ordinary sine - gordon model can be used .",
    "a feature of the multi - frequency model that is new compared to the usual sine - gordon model is  apart form non - integrability  that phase transition can occur as the coupling constants are tuned .",
    "we concentrate our attention to this property .",
    "it should be noted that such a phase transition is related to the evolution of the particle spectrum of the theory as the coupling constants vary , and we shall use the massgap and other characteristics of the energy spectrum as order parameter .    our investigation is a continuation of the work done on the double - frequency case in @xcite .",
    "we use the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) , which is a non - perturbative numerical method to compute the lowest levels of the spectrum of the hamiltonian operator of perturbed conformal field theories in finite volume .",
    "the applicability and reliability of this method was thoroughly investigated in @xcite , and it was shown that the existence , nature and location of the phase transition can be established by this method , although rather large number of dimensions are needed for satisfactory precision .",
    "in particular , the existence and location of an ising type transition was established in the double - frequency model ( dsg ) for the ratio @xmath1 of the frequencies , verifying a prediction by @xcite based on perturbation theory and classical arguments .",
    "we extend these investigations to the ratio @xmath2 and to the three - frequency model ( at the ratio @xmath3 of the frequencies ) , in which a tricritical point and first order transition are expected to be found .",
    "the numerical nature of the tcsa makes it necessary to choose specific values for the frequencies .    after introducing the multi - frequency sine - gordon model and describing basic properties of it in section [ sec : ketto ] ,",
    "we briefly review the tcsa framework for the model ( which is the framework described in @xcite adapted to the multi - frequency model ) in section [ sec : harom ] . in section [ sec : negy ] we give a description of the phase structure of the classical two- and three - frequency model , which serves as a reference for the investigations in quantum theory . the @xmath4-frequency case is also considered briefly .",
    "exact and elementary analytic methods can be applied to the classical case , and the results are more general than in the quantum case .",
    "section [ sec : ot ] is devoted to theoretical considerations on the signatures of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions in the framework of perturbed conformal field theory in finite volume .",
    "most of these considerations , which are necessary for the evaluation of the tcsa data , can also be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : hat ] and [ sec : het ] we present the results we obtained by tcsa on the phase structure of the two- and three - frequency model , which are the main results in the paper .",
    "a summary of the results and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the action of the multi - frequency sine - gordon model ( msg ) is    @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the potential , which contains @xmath4 cosine terms .",
    "@xmath7 is a real scalar field defined on the two - dimensional minkowski space @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the frequencies , @xmath10 if @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the coupling constants ( of dimension mass@xmath13 at the classical level ) and @xmath14 are the phases in the terms of the potential .",
    "two cases can be distinguished according to the periodicity properties of the potential .",
    "the first one is the rational case , when @xmath15 is a trigonometric polynomial : the ratios of the frequencies @xmath16 are rational and the potential is periodic .",
    "let the period of the potential be @xmath17 in this case .",
    "the target space of the field @xmath7 can be compactified : @xmath18 where @xmath19 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the model obtained in this way is called the @xmath20-folded msg .",
    "the well - known classical sine - gordon model corresponds to @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the other case is the irrational one , when the potential is not periodic and no such folding can be made .",
    "the irrational case is much more complicated than the rational one , so we restrict our attention to the rational case in the present paper .",
    "we remark here only that although @xmath15 always has a finite infimum , it does not necessarily admit an absolute minimum .",
    "the potential @xmath15 can always be written uniquely as a sum @xmath23 , where the terms @xmath24 are periodic but any sum of any of these terms is not periodic .",
    "@xmath15 has an absolute minimum if and only if @xmath25 have a common absolute minimum .",
    "this occurs for special choice of the @xmath26 , if the values of @xmath16 are given .",
    "in particular , if @xmath27 are irrational for all @xmath11 and @xmath28 for all @xmath29 , then @xmath15 has a absolute minimum if and only if @xmath30 is satisfied with some numbers @xmath31 , which is equivalent to the case @xmath32 for all @xmath29 .",
    "see and @xcite and @xcite for further remarks on the irrational case .    at the quantum level",
    "the theory can be regarded as a perturbed conformal field theory : @xmath33 where@xmath34 which is the action of the free scalar particle of zero mass , and@xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the vertex operator @xmath37 which is a primary field with conformal dimensions @xmath38 in the unperturbed ( conformal ) field theory .",

    "we also assume that @xmath42 which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the model to be free from ultraviolet divergencies in the perturbed conformal field theory framework @xcite .",
    "the model has a massgap in general , and it is clear that phase transitions occur in the classical version of the model as the coupling constants are tuned ( assuming that @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is also expected that there are topologically charged solutions / states in the model @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall investigate the sector with zero topological charge , which is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to 1-folded models ( @xmath22 ) , as it is natural to expect that in infinite volume a folding number @xmath44 results simply in a @xmath20-fold multiplication of the spectrum corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix elements of the total hamiltonian operator @xmath45 can be calculated explicitly ( and exactly ) between any two elements of the hilbert space @xmath46 of the conformal field theory .",
    "restricting to a finite dimensional subspace @xmath47 of @xmath46 by introducing an upper conformal energy cutoff @xmath48 becomes a finite matrix , which can be diagonalized numerically to get an approximation of the spectrum .",

    "it is clear from ( [ tcsa hamilton ] ) that tcsa gives an exact result if @xmath98 ( assuming ( [ relevance ] ) ) and this limit of the theory is the conformal theory ( the massless free boson ) , and the accuracy of the tcsa spectrum decreases at fixed @xmath65 as @xmath99 .",
    "for very large values of @xmath100 the @xmath100-dependence of the spectrum of the tcsa hamiltonian is power - like , as it is determined directly by the @xmath101 coefficients in ( [ tcsa hamilton ] ) .",

    "increasing the value of @xmath65 generally increases accuracy , and the tcsa is expected to give better approximation for the lower lying energy levels than for the higher ones .",

    "see @xcite for a detailed investigation of these ( integrable ) limiting cases .",
    "the phases of the classical model are determined by the behaviour of absolute minima of @xmath15 as the value of the coupling constants vary .",
    "in particular , proposition 1 implies that the phase structure of the two - frequency model is the following :    the model exhibits an ising - type second order phase transition at the critical value @xmath126 of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath127 if @xmath21 and @xmath113 has the @xmath128-symmetry introduced above .",

    "a complete description of the behaviour of the absolute minima of @xmath113 for all values of the parameters becomes excessively difficult in the three- and higher - frequency cases , so we restrict our attention to particular values .",

    "the resulting energy split between the degenerate vacua vanishes exponentially as @xmath99 .    in the critical points ( in infinite volume )",
    "the massgap vanishes and the hilbert space contains a sector that corresponds to the conformal field theory specifying the universality class of the critical point .",
    "we consider this sector in the following discussion . in finite but large volume near the critical point this sector of the theory",
    "can be regarded as the @xmath99 limiting conformal theory perturbed by some irrelevant and relevant operators .",
    "the corresponding tcsa hamiltonian takes the ( generic ) form @xmath176 where the @xmath177 are the perturbing fields .",
    "this picture gives the following volume dependence of energy levels ( in the first order of conformal perturbation theory):@xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the conformal weights of the state @xmath181 in the @xmath99 limiting cft , @xmath182 are constants that also depend on the particular energy eigenstate @xmath181 .",
    "the presence of irrelevant perturbations ( @xmath183 ) is due to the finiteness of the volume , whereas the presence of the relevant perturbations ( @xmath184 ) is caused by the deviation of the control parameters from the critical value and by the uv cutoff .",
    "the location of the critical points can be determined using the criterion of vanishing massgap . a more precise method that also allows the determination of the universality class of the critical point ( i.e. the @xmath99 limiting cft ) is the following : we make an assumption that the critical point is in a certain universality class .",
    "this assumption predicts the set of @xmath177-s , the values of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , and the values of the @xmath185-s in ( [ l fugges ] ) .",
    "we take leading terms of the series on the r.h.s . of ( [ l fugges ] ) and determine the value of the @xmath186-s and of the @xmath182-s by fitting to the tcsa energy data .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath182-s corresponding to the relevant perturbations measures the deviation from the critical point , so if the assumption on the universality class is right , then by tuning the coupling constants one should be able to find a ( critical ) value of the control parameter at which these @xmath182-s are small , the tcsa data are described well by ( [ l fugges ] ) ( terms from higher orders of perturbation theory can be included if necessary ) in a reasonably large interval of the values of @xmath100 , and the values of the @xmath187-s obtained from the tcsa data agree with the assumption with good precision .",
    "the interval where ( [ l fugges ] ) describes the tcsa data well is called the scaling region",
    ". this region may be ( and in fact is ) different for different energy levels .",
    "we remark that it is also possible to make a theoretical prediction for @xmath188 , which allows to extract @xmath189 from the tcsa data for @xmath188 in principle @xcite .",
    "however , experience ( @xcite ) shows that the accuracy of the tcsa data is not sufficient to determine @xmath189 precisely in this way , so we do not attempt to extract @xmath189 directly from the tcsa data in this paper .    in the classical case",
    "a first order phase transition occurs when the absolute minimum of the potential becomes a relative minimum and a previously relative minimum becomes absolute . in the quantum case",
    "this phase transition is characterized by the presence of `` runaway '' energy levels with asymptotic behaviour @xmath190 for large @xmath100 in the neighborhood of the transition point , where @xmath84 is a constant that tends to zero as the transition point is approached .",
    "the multiplicity of the ground state also changes as the transition point is passed if the two phases have different symmetry properties .",

    "the dimension of the truncated hilbert space was @xmath250 in these calculations , which corresponded to @xmath251 .",
    "the value of @xmath198 was @xmath202 .",
    "figures [ dikrit vonal].a - l show the tcsa spectra ( especially the lowest lying energy levels ) obtained in these points as well as the values of @xmath247 corresponding to both the critical and the tricritical ising model .",
    "crosses are used for odd parity states , squares are used for even parity states .",
    "it can be seen that moving on the critical line in the phase space towards the tricritical endpoint the finite volume spectrum changes continuously . in the @xmath252 domain",
    "the spectra ( especially the first two levels ) correspond clearly to phase transitions in the ising universality class . at @xmath253",
    "the first excited level already appears to correspond to the prediction of the tricritical ising model , whereas the second excited level still has the behaviour predicted by the ising model .",
    "it would be very interesting to know the large volume behaviour ( and infinite volume limit ) of the first excited level , but the precision of tcsa does not allow to determine it .",
    "what we can see is that there is no sign in the tcsa data that the first excited level follows the predictions of the ising model in the large volume limit . in the domain @xmath254",
    "there is a spectacular rearrangement of the higher energy levels ( already observable in the @xmath252 domain ) , and at @xmath255 the second excited level also appears to correspond to the prediction of the tricritical ising model .",
    "we regard therefore the point @xmath255 , @xmath256 to be the tricritical endpoint of the critical line , this point is marked by a square in figure [ threefreq phasediag ] .",
    "( we did not aspire to determine the value of @xmath248 more precisely for this value of @xmath198 . )",
    "each figure shows the spectrum in the volume interval @xmath257 , and for the large values @xmath258 the truncation error is always conspicuous .",
    "a : @xmath259b : @xmath260    c : @xmath261d : @xmath262    e : @xmath263f : @xmath253    g : @xmath264h : @xmath265    i : @xmath266j : @xmath267    k : @xmath255l : @xmath268    moreover , the value of @xmath100 where the truncation errors become large gets smaller and smaller as the tricritical point is approached , which corresponds to the fact that a tricritical point as renormalization group fixed point is more repelling than an ising type one .",
    "increasing @xmath248 further the behaviour corresponding to the tricritical point would rapidly disappear from the finite volume spectrum .",
    "figures [ nemkrit atmenet].a - j show tcsa spectra obtained at @xmath269 and at various values of @xmath249 between @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "the energy levels are shown as compared to the lowest level .",
    "the dimension of the truncated hilbert space was @xmath272 in these calculations , which corresponded to @xmath273 .",
    "the value of @xmath198 was @xmath202 .",
    "dashed lines are used for odd parity levels and continuous lines for even parity levels .    at @xmath274 ( and",
    "also for @xmath275 ) the ground state is unique for all values of @xmath100 , whereas doubly degenerate runaway levels can also be seen . at @xmath276 , however , the ground level is doubly degenerate for small values of the volume but becomes nondegenerate in large volume ,    a : @xmath274b : @xmath277    c : @xmath276d : @xmath278    e : @xmath279f : @xmath280    g : @xmath281h : @xmath282    i : @xmath283j : @xmath284    i.e. there is a value of @xmath100 where the doubly degenerate runaway level and the single level cross each other .",
    "the slope of the runaway levels become smaller and smaller as @xmath249 is increased , and the crossing point also moves towards larger and larger values . at @xmath285",
    "the ground state is already doubly degenerate for all values of @xmath100 and nondegenerate runaway levels are present .",
    "these features indicate that a first order phase transition occurs at an intermediate value of @xmath249 .",
    "the behaviour of the finite volume spectra around the transition point seen in the figures implies that a precise determination of the transition point from the tcsa data in a direct way would require precise data for large values of @xmath100 .",
    "for this reason we did not aspire to find many points of the line of first order phase transition , we did tcsa calculations only at @xmath286 and @xmath269 , and we roughly estimated the location of the first order phase transition at these values . our estimation based on the tcsa data are @xmath284 and @xmath279 .",
    "these points are also marked in figure [ threefreq phasediag ] by crosses .",
    "the figures [ nemkrit atmenet].a - j show the first @xmath287 levels in the domain @xmath257 .",
    "unfortunately the truncation effect is large in most of this domain of @xmath100 , however we expect that those qualitative features of the spectra which we allude to are correct .",
    "in this work we investigated selected special cases of the multi - frequency sine - gordon theory , especially the structure of their phase space , continuing the work begun in @xcite . concerning the classical limit we found that the only possible phase transition in the ( rational ) two - frequency case is a second order ising - type transition .",
    "the three - frequency model has some new qualitative features compared to the two - frequency model : a tricritical point which is at the end of a critical line can also be found , and first order transition is possible as well .",
    "the phase space of the @xmath4-frequency model contains @xmath4-fold critical points , otherwise we do not expect new qualitative features compared to the three - frequency model .",
    "the numerical ( tcsa ) calculations in the quantum case yielded the following results : we found the same type of phase transitions as in the classical case , in particular we were able to determine the second order ising nature and the location of the phase transition in the two - frequency model with good precision .",
    "quantum corrections did not alter the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the accuracy of the tcsa also allowed us to find the tricritical point in the three - frequency case , which we regard the main result of the paper .",
    "this demanded much more numerical work than the two - frequency model for the following reasons : the two - frequency model has only one - dimensional phase space , whereas the phase space is two - dimensional in the three - frequency model ; and the tricritical point as a renormalization group fixed point is more repelling than the ising - type critical point , so we had to take larger truncated space .",
    "furthermore , we found several points of the critical line and observed how the tcsa spectrum changes as the tricritical endpoint is approached .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this with considerably better precision .",
    "although the focus was mainly on the tricritical point , we also investigated the first order phase transition in the three - frequency model and we found that the first order nature can be established by tcsa , but the location of the transition can be determined much less accurately than that of the second - order transition .",
    "we expect that multicritical points in the universality classes of further elements of the discrete unitary series could be found in the higher - frequency models , but increasing accuracy is needed , because these multicritical points are more and more repelling .",
    "finally , we remark that the quantum corrections did not alter the nature of the phase transitions in any of the cases we investigated , and in the classical and quantum theory the location of transition points is almost the same .",
    "the investigation of the multi - frequency model with irrational frequency ratios is still an open problem .",
    "we also remark that the particle content of the multi - frequency sine - gordon model could also be investigated by the method of semiclassical quantization @xcite .",
