    "narrow - line seyfert  1 objects ( nls1s ) are a phenomenologically interesting subclass of seyfert  1s .",
    "as their name suggests , they have the narrowest permitted lines of all seyfert  1s ( fwhm(h@xmath0 ) @xmath1 2000 km s@xmath2 ) , which appear to be associated with a range of other extremal properties , including strong , steep , soft x - ray excesses , strong permitted fe  ii lines , weak forbidden lines , and a high degree of short timescale variability in x - rays .",
    "coronal lines , forbidden transitions from highly ionised states of iron , are often present in their optical spectra .",
    "their properties form a continuum with those of `` normal '' seyfert 1s , but as they show extremal properties , they are important for testing agn unification schemes .",
    "it is thought likely that they are seyfert 1s with low mass black holes and/or high accretion rates .    to further understand the nature of the soft uv / x - ray excess , which is an important component of the energy output of these objects , we wish to study the euv continuum .",
    "as this is not directly observable for extragalactic objects due to galactic absorption , we use coronal lines ( which have ionisation energies @xmath3 a few hundred ev ) as diagnostics of this region .",
    "this approach also allows us to investigate the physical conditions in the coronal line region , particularly by kinematic methods .",
    "nineteen nls1s from the soft x - ray observed sample of boller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) were observed between 5  11 august 1996 , using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph mounted on the isaac newton telescope at la palma , obtaining dispersions of 1.6  3.2   pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the data were reduced with the starlink project s ` figaro ` software , and fitted using the ` elf ` routines in ` dipso ` , which simultaneusly fitted gaussian line profiles and a linear continuum .",
    "this approach allowed the deblending of neighbouring lines .",
    "the coronal lines [ fe vii ] @xmath46038.9 , [ fe x ] @xmath46374.6 , [ fe xi ] @xmath47891.9 and [ fe xiv ] @xmath45302.86 were identified where possible , and upper limits were placed on them otherwise .",
    "line profiles were then transformed into velocity space relative to the rest - frame of the [ o iii ] @xmath54959 , 5007 doublet .",
    "erkens et al . ( 1997 ) noted a tendency for broader coronal lines to be more blueshifted than narrower ones . to further investigate this correlation in a manner independent of black hole mass",
    ", we assume that the fwhm of coronal lines is governed by the virial theorem and define a _ radial estimator _",

    "the minimum value of @xmath9 observed is 0.024 , which constrains the maximum size of the region over which the gas is accelerated .",
    "for those objects for which at least 3 coronal lines had been detected , we plotted @xmath9 against the ionisation potential , in order to determine if stratification of the clr was important . for arakelian 564 , there is a trend towards more highly ionised gas being detected closer to the nucleus , but this trend is not unambiguously detected in other objects ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "equivalent widths of [ fe vii ] and [ fe x ] were compared with rosat pspc photon indices obtained from boller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "no strong correlation is present for either line .",
    "gas in the coronal line region is outflowing , and this outflow appears to be decelerating . the coronal line gas has reached an outflow velocity of 420 km s@xmath2 within a distance from the nucleus estimated to be @xmath11 that of the nlr . radiation pressure does not appear to drive motion in the clr , as this would be expected to produce accelerating , rather than decelerating outflows ( see binette ( 1998 ) for an example of a radiation pressure driven model ) .",
    "coronal line strengths do not follow a simple correlation with rosat pspc photon index . to investigate the euv continuum in more detail",
    ", we plan to create photoionisation models based on a fixed power - law , with a black body component of variable luminosity and temperature added , and test the predictions of these models against our observed coronal line strengths .",
    "the models will also allow for stratification of the clr .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "t. roberts for his help with the observations .",
