    "squeezed light is widely used in spectroscopic and interferometric experiments to enhance the measurement sensitivity and to overcome the quantum shot - noise limit  @xcite . in low - temperature setups , such as in superconducting microwave circuits , it could be a benefit to have a miniaturized source of nonclassical radiation , which can be used for , e.g. , qubit measurement , control , and communication .    when driven by a coherent microwave drive , a transmission - line resonator terminated by a josephson junction can be used to create quadrature - squeezed microwave radiation  @xcite . without an external coherent drive , but with a simple dc - voltage bias , a josephson junction can be a source of microwaves with reduced photon - number fluctuations , so - called photon - number squeezed light  @xcite .",

    "the different regimes `` a '' to `` e '' and the different plot markers are discussed in the main text . ]    for this set of parameters we see a non - monotonous behavior of the fano factor as a function of the disorder boxwidth .",
    "we discriminate different regimes , labeled in fig .  [ fig : disordergatecharge ] by `` a '' to `` e '' , in which the mean photon - number expectation value @xmath138 and the mean fano factor @xmath139 depend differently on the disorder boxwidth @xmath133 . to understand this behavior it is important to notice that an increase of the disorder boxwidth effectively decreases the number of atoms in the lasing setup . in the case of conventional lasing in the presence of disorder , this phenomenon has been discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "atoms with a too large detuning or a too small coupling strength can not participate in the lasing process any more and , therefore , the effective pumping strength @xmath116 decreases . if the conventional photon number @xmath112 corresponding to this effective pumping strength becomes lower than a certain root of the coupling matrix elements , the laser switches from a state trapped at this root to a state trapped at the next - lower root .",
    "therefore , we observe plateaus in the mean photon - number expectation value @xmath104 that correspond to the positions of the roots of the coupling matrix elements ( `` a '' , `` c '' , and `` e '' for the third , second , and first root , respectively ) .    between these trapped regimes",
    "there are ranges of the disorder boxwidth where the photon number is either trapped at the higher or the lower root of the coupling matrix element , depending on the actual distribution of the gate charges ( regimes `` b '' and `` d '' ) .",
    "the histogram of the photon - number expectation value @xmath104 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : disordergatecharge ] shows two distinct peaks corresponding to trapping at the two adjacent roots ( data set `` ii '' , corresponding to the regime `` d '' ) . in this transition region , the mean photon - number expectation value @xmath138 and its standard deviation reflect a transition from a single - peaked distribution at a large photon number ( data set `` i '' ) via a double - peaked distribution to a single - peaked distribution at a small photon number ( data set `` iii '' ) , rather than characterizing the mean photon number and its sample - to - sample fluctuations to be expected for a particular realization of the lasing setup .",
    "likewise , in the transition regimes `` b '' and `` d '' the mean fano factor and its standard deviation are no longer well - defined quantities : if the lasing parameters happen to describe a lasing state that has a double - peaked photon statistics at both roots , a very large fano factor @xmath153 is obtained .",
    "the data set `` ii '' in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : disordergatecharge ] shows one such event at @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , the histogram of the fano factor has not only two peaks at @xmath155 , corresponding to systems trapped at the two adjacent roots of the coupling , but also a tail of very rare realizations of lasing systems that have a fano factor @xmath153 .",
    "due to these very rare events , @xmath139 and its standard deviation are no longer smooth functions of the disorder boxwidth and we do not plot the fano factor standard deviation in the transition regions as it lacks clear physical meaning . if we calculate the mean fano factor @xmath139 considering only those realizations of lasing systems with a fano factor smaller than @xmath156 a smooth dependence of this modified mean fano factor of the disorder boxwidth is obtained .",
    "x - shaped data points indicate that lasing systems with very large fano factors @xmath157 have been neglected .    within the trapped regimes",
    "`` c '' and `` e '' the mean photon - number expectation value decreases linearly as a function of the disorder boxwidth @xmath133 , but the slope is quite small ( note the change of the @xmath133 axis scale at @xmath158 ) .",
    "likewise , the mean fano factor @xmath139 increases linearly with the disorder . in the regime ``",
    "a '' a crossover from constant photon number ( fano factor ) in the limit of very small disorder to a linear decrease ( increase ) for large disorder is observed . in the trapped regimes",
    "`` a '' , `` c '' , and `` e '' the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the photon - number expectation value and the fano factor can be decreased by using a larger number of atoms @xmath4 and a larger resonator decay rate @xmath71 , while keeping the cooperativity @xmath36 and @xmath112 constant . however , this is only a weak effect and there are constraints on the maximum possible number of atoms in the setup .",
    "for instance , the fluctuations at @xmath159 are reduced by a factor of @xmath160 if a five times larger system is used .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath138 and @xmath139 on the disorder in the regimes `` c '' and `` e '' makes them promising for an experimental realization of the cpt lasing setup . for the parameters considered here the setup is expected to create photon - number squeezed resonator states characterized by a fano factor @xmath161 at a photon number of @xmath162 even in the presence of maximum charge disorder .",
    "generally , the photon - number expectation value in the limit of maximum disorder , @xmath141 , is determined by the position of the first root of the coupling matrix elements .",
    "therefore , choosing a smaller value of @xmath27 increases the brightness of the laser because the position of the first root is shifted towards larger photon numbers . on the other hand , this increases the fano factor in the limit of maximum disorder because the regime of conventional lasing for photon numbers below the first root of the coupling ( cf .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] ) increases and some atoms will eventually reach this regime of conventional lasing .",
    "therefore , there is a tradeoff between a high photon number and a small fano factor in the limit @xmath141 .",
    "lasing at higher roots of the coupling matrix elements , e.g. , for rather large values @xmath163 , yields a photon - number squeezed statistics as well .",
    "however , setups with a large value of @xmath27 are expected to be less robust against disorder , because the number of transition regions between regimes trapped at different roots of the coupling grows and the ranges of the disorder boxwidth @xmath133 decrease , where a trapped state is robust against disorder .",
    "in this article we presented a lasing setup based on multiple cooper - pair transistors coupled to a single microwave resonator . over a broad range of experimentally feasible parameters",
    "this laser creates photon - number squeezed light at large intensity .",
    "the photon - number squeezing arises because of the presence of roots of the coupling matrix elements between the charge states of the cooper - pair transistor and the resonator .    compared to the systems discussed in ref .  ,",
    "based on two - level systems with longitudinal coupling to a resonator , the cooper - pair injection lasing setup considered here has two advantages : first , it is very robust against the charge noise of the cooper - pair transistor .",
    "we found a regime where the fano factor is significantly smaller than unity and almost independent of the disorder strength , even in the presence of maximum charge noise and strong qubit dephasing .",
    "therefore , an experimental realization of this effect is very feasible .",
    "second , the realizable fano factor is not bound from below by the number @xmath4 of artificial atoms , i.e. , the emission intensity can be increased independently of the fano factor by adding more cooper - pair transistors to the setup .",
    "our results will help the construction of bright and robust miniaturized sources of nonclassical microwave radiation , which may have important applications in low - temperature experiments .",
    "in particular , photon - number squeezed light can be useful for , e.g. , frequency - modulation spectroscopy and , due to its well defined power , calibration of low - temperature devices .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with g.  schn . this work has been funded from the dfg grant no .",

    "in this appendix we show that the ic coupling   between different cpts , which so far had been neglected in the effective lasing hamiltonian  , is only a small perturbation of the lasing state if the total dephasing rate is larger than the coupling energies , @xmath164 .    above the lasing threshold the expectation values @xmath165 and",

    "the omitted prefactors are of the order of unity",

    "intuitively , weak interatomic couplings in a multiatom lasing setup level differences in the population inversion of the individual atoms , which may arise because of fluctuations in the pumping or coupling strength , but they do not spoil lasing processes .",
