    "the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are a sub - class of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , in which a roche - lobe overflowing , main sequence or subgiant star , typically @xmath3 , orbits a neutron star or black hole , with an orbital period of a few hours to a few days .",
    "the sxts undergo episodic periods of x - ray and optical outbursts , which are separated by long intervals ( several decades ) of quiescence .",
    "the most fundamental parameter is the orbital period , which sets the size and evolutionary state of the system .",
    "however , one can only determine the orbital period of the sxts when they have subsided into quiescence ( unless the system is eclipsing ) .",
    "it is only then one can undertake a radial velocity study of the secondary star in order to determine the orbital period . even then , some systems ( e.g. gs135464 and a1524617 ) are just too faint to obtain radial velocity curves with conventional sized telescopes ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .    in this letter",
    "we derive an empirical formula that allows us to estimate the orbital period of a sxt given only the size of the optical outburst amplitude .",

    "in table 1 we give the general properties of the sxts . during quiescence",
    "many of the sources show changes in the mean brightness from year to year , combined with the fact that in some the optical nova was not discovered optically until several days after the initial x - ray outburst .",
    "we therefore estimate typical errors for the outburst amplitude to be around 0.2 magnitudes . in fig .",
    "1 we show the relation between orbital period and the amplitude of the optical outburst .",
    "there is only a lower limit to the quiescent magnitude of exo0748 - 676 , therefore it is not included in fig .",
    "we find that as the orbital period increases , the amplitude of the outburst decreases .",
    "such a correlation is not unexpected , as this reflects the fact that at longer orbital periods , the secondary star is larger and hence more luminous than a system at a shorter orbital period .",
    "the only systems that do not fit this correlation are the extremely long period systems groj165540 and gs2023 + 338 ; which both have periods greater than 1 day .",
    "both systems have secondary stars sufficiently evolved from the main sequence that one can not compare them to the other transients .",
    "therefore in what follows we restrict ourselves to those transients with orbital periods less than 1 day .",
    "for @xmath6 24 we find that the @xmath0@xmath7 relationship is well represented by a linear least - squares fit of the form    @xmath8    which has a correlation coefficient of @xmath90.93 ( the 1-@xmath10 errors were calculated after rescaling the error bars to give a fit with @xmath11 of 1 ) .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) it is therefore possible to estimate the orbital period of a transient given only the observed values for its outburst amplitude .",
    "for some of the x - ray transients , their quiescent magnitudes have proved too faint for one to obtain accurate radial velocity or photometric light curves of the secondary star , which will allow one to determine the orbital period of these systems . in the next section",
    "we estimate quiescent magnitudes and/or the orbital periods of a few of the faint transients .      for a roche - lobe filling star the average density ,",
    "@xmath12 is simply a function of the orbital period ( frank , king & raine 1985 ) .",
    "for exo0748676 with @xmath1=3.82 hrs , @xmath12=7.54 g  @xmath13 , which implies a m34v star ( allen 1981 ) .",
    "this can be compared with the spectral type of the secondary star obtained by determining its absolute magnitude . using equation ( 4 ) we find @xmath14=10.2 mags , which implies an m23 v star ( allen 1981 ) .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) we can also predict the quiescent magnitude of exo0748 - 676 . with @xmath15=16.9",
    ", we find @xmath1626.8 mags , which is consistent with the observed limit of @xmath1723 mags ( see table 1 ) . however , if the secondary star is sufficently evolved for it to be degenerate , then it would not obey equation ( 4 ) and would probably be fainter .",
    "note that the models of king , kolb & burderi ( 1996 ) show that neutron - star sxts may require evolved companions , even at short orbital periods .",
    "we can estimate the orbital period for grs135464 by using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "since there are no @xmath18-band measurements for the system in quiescence , we use the colors of a k0m0 star in order to determine @xmath19 . using @xmath20=20.3 mags ( martin 1996 ) , @xmath21=1.0 mags ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) and ( v - r)=0.61.2 mags ( k0m0@xmath22 ; allen 1981 )",
    ", we estimate @xmath19=21.622.2 mags . then using equation ( 1 ) with @xmath15=16.9 mags ( pederson , ilovaisky & van der klis 1987 ) gives @xmath0=4.75.3 mags and hence @xmath1=15.418.5 hrs , which is consistent with that obtained by martin ( 1996 ) ; 15.6 hrs .",
    "masetti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) interpret a 14.7 hr periodicity as the superhump period .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the true orbital period should be a few percent shorter .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) with @xmath15=16.3 mags and @xmath1721 mags ( della valle , mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) we estimate @xmath2318.5 hrs , which is consistent with the superhump period .",
    "the amplitude of the optical outburst , @xmath24 is the difference in magnitudes between the system in quiescence and in outburst ,    @xmath25    where @xmath19 and @xmath26 are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the system in quiescence , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath27 are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the system in outburst , respectively .    in outburst the hot accretion disc dominates the optical flux [ @xmath28 , whereas in quiescence the observed optical flux arises from the secondary star [ @xmath29 and the contribution from the cool accretion disc .",
    "the magnitude of the system in quiescence @xmath19 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fraction of light arising from the secondary star ; @xmath31=1.0 implies all the optical flux in quiescence come from the secondary stars .",
    "typically @xmath31 is about 0.5 , i.e. 50% of the light comes from the secondary star ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1989 ; mcclintock & remillard 1986 ; and charles 1996 )",
    ". we can therefore write    @xmath32    warner ( 1987 , 1995 ) finds that the luminosity of the companion stars in cataclysmic variables ( @xmath110 ) are indistinguishable from main sequence stars .",
    "the secondary stars in lmxbs with orbital periods 12 hrs will also lie on the main sequence or the terminal age main sequence ( shahbaz , naylor & charles 1997 ) , and so we extend warner s relation to 12 hrs .",
    "he finds that the absolute magnitude of the secondary star can be represented by    @xmath33    unfortunately , a similar relationship does not exist for evolved stars , therefore the following is only applicable for systems with un - evolved secondaries , i.e. systems with @xmath112 hrs .",
    "since we have relationships for @xmath0 and @xmath14 as functions of the orbital period ( @xmath612 ) , we can then derive a similar relationship for @xmath34    @xmath35    as the orbital period increases , the size of the system also increases .",
    "if we assume that during outburst the size of the accretion discs in sxts are similar i.e. the accretion discs extends out to the tidal radius , then one expects the accretion disc during outburst to brighten as the orbital period of the system increases , simply because of the increase in the projected surface area of the accretion disc .",
    "equation ( 5 ) can be compared with the formula give by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ) .",
    "they determine a relationship between the absolute magnitude of the accretion disc , x - ray luminosity and orbital period for sxts in outburst and lmxbs .",
    "we can rewrite their equation as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the outburst x - ray luminosity and @xmath38 is the eddington limited luminosity for a 1.4 m@xmath39 neutron star .",
    "( it should be noted that , although van paradijs & mcclintock included the black hole candidates a062000 and gs2023 + 338 , removing these points does not change the correlation significantly . ) chen , shrader & livio ( 1997 ) tabulate @xmath40 for all the lmxbs and sxts in outburst , where in this case @xmath38 is the eddington limiting for an object with general mass @xmath41 . by fitting the data points for systems with orbital periods less than 12 hrs",
    ", we obtain a linear least - squares fit of the form    @xmath42    from equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we obtain the absolute magnitude of the accretion disc as a function of orbital period :    @xmath43    as one can see the gradients of equation ( 5 ) and ( 8) are comparable ( at the 90 per cent confidence level ) . however , unlike the correlation derived by van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ) , the relation we obtain for the absolute magnitude of the accretion disc does not depend on the distance and reddening to the sxt .",
    "we therefore believe that equation ( 5 ) is a better representation of the absolute magnitude of the accretion disc in lmxb for systems with @xmath612 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the absolute magnitudes of the accretion discs in dwarf novae and sxts in outburst . by manipulating equation ( 13 ) of warner ( 1987 ) for the absolute magnitude of accretion discs in dwarf novae at maximum light , we find    @xmath44    comparing this with equation ( 5 ) , we find for a given orbital period , the accretion discs in sxts during outburst are more than 4 magnitudes brighter ( depending on the value for @xmath31 ) than dwarf novae at maximum light , which is typically what is expected ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "we note that this is similar to the difference of the mean absolute magnitudes derived for persistent lmxbs and cvs ( e.g. nova - likes ; see van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ) .",
    "this difference in brightness has a natural explanation in that accretion discs of sxts in outburst and persistent lmxbs are dominated by x - ray irradiation , whereas the discs in cvs are not ( see e.g. van paradijs & verbunt 1984 and van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the orbital separation of the sxts , ( most of which are black holes ) are probably a factor 2 larger at a given period , therefore disc area is 4 times larger than in the dwarf novae .",
    "this combined with the fact that the accretion rate of a sxt disc in outburst is an order of magnitude higher than in a dwarf nova at a given period may partly explain the difference in accretion disc magnitudes .",
    "we can now use equation ( 5 ) along with the distance modulus equation to obtain an expression for the distance to the x - ray transients ( @xmath45 12 ) as a function of orbital period :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the distance in kpc and @xmath48 is the reddening .    in table 2 we estimate the distances for 7 transients using this relation ( we have assumed @xmath31=1.0 , so the distance estimates are lower limits )",
    ". as one can see for most of the systems our estimates agree quite well with the values in the literature ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the main uncertainty in determining the distance is the value used for the reddening .",
    "by fitting the outburst amplitudes for 8 x - ray transients we determine an empirical relation that can be used to predict the orbital period of an x - ray transient .",
    "also , for periods below less than 12 hrs we determine a relation for the absolute magnitude of the accretion disc during outburst , which allows us to estimate the distances to the sources .",
