    "we are interested in a particular grading , the crossed - product grading , on @xmath4 given by a group @xmath0 of order @xmath1 : to produce this grading we begin by imbedding @xmath0 , via the regular representation , in the group @xmath23 of @xmath7 permutation matrices .",
    "we then set @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the set of diagonal matrices and @xmath26 is the permutation matrix corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "our main objects of study are the graded @xmath5identities on @xmath4 endowed with the @xmath0crossed product grading .",
    "our approach is to use graph theory in a way analogous to our work on @xmath0graded identities on @xmath4 , where the @xmath0grading is the crossed - product grading described above .",

    "our proof uses an analogue of swan s theorem on paths of length @xmath37 in a directed graph with @xmath1 vertices .",

    "the @xmath42graded @xmath39-codimension @xmath43 of @xmath4 is the dimension of @xmath38 modulo the graded @xmath5identities : @xmath44    we prove ( theorem [ asymptotic ] ) the following asymptotic result : @xmath45 a formula interesting both because of its independence of @xmath0 and its simplicity .",

    "but these two conditions are precisely the conditions of equivalence of monomials : condition ( 1 ) is the condition to have the same group weight and condition ( 2 ) is the condition that the group element applied to @xmath147 is the same for all @xmath98 .",
    "so we have that if @xmath124 is an identity then each @xmath125 vanishes upon substitution with algebraically independent entries for the diagonal elements . by specialization",
    "it follows that in fact each @xmath125 is itself an identity .",
    "but for a given @xmath125 the substitution described above has the same diagonal part and permutation matrix part for each monomial .",

    "clear    we now introduce the graph of a strongly multilinear monomial . as in the case of graded identities without an involution , the kind of graphs we consider will be finite directed graphs , with labels on the vertices and the edges .",
    "every edge has a direction .",
    "there may be several edges in both directions between two given vertices and there may be edges with the same beginning and ending vertex .",
    "we begin with a finite group @xmath0 of order @xmath1 . for each",
    "strongly multilinear monomial @xmath150 in the free algebra @xmath27 we first form a preliminary graph : there are @xmath1 vertices labeled by all of the elements of the group .",
    "if there are no starred variables then the preliminary graph is just the graph of the monomial we considered in the case of grading without involution ( and this will be the final graph in this case , too ) .",
    "we remind the reader of that construction : there is an edge labeled @xmath151 from the vertex labeled @xmath152 to the vertex @xmath153 and , for @xmath154 , an edge labeled @xmath155 from the vertex labeled @xmath156 to the vertex @xmath157 . in other words the graph is really a directed path through the vertices starting at @xmath152 and passing successively through @xmath158 , and so on , ending at @xmath159 .",
    "this is in fact a directed eulerian path through the graph ( that is , it uses each edge exactly once ) .",
    "now , if there are starred variables , then the preliminary graph is obtained by starting with the basic graph of the monomial obtained by changing each starred variable @xmath129 to @xmath160 and adding a star to each edge that came from a starred variable .",
    "then the final graph is obtained by reversing each starred edge and removing the star .",
    "note that when we reverse the edge we are changing the weight of that edge from @xmath161 back to @xmath128 .",
    "this graph also has an eulerian path : the edges are numbered @xmath162 , but this path is not necessarily directed ; some of the edges may be reversed .",
    "moreover one can read off the monomial from this path : the order of the numbering of the variables is given by the ordering of the edges in the path , the weights are the weights determined by those edges , and the  exponent \" is @xmath5 if the path reverses the direction of the edge and nothing if it goes in the same direction .",
    "example : let @xmath163 be the cyclic group of order 3 .",
    "consider the monomial @xmath164 . here",
    "are the ( a ) preliminary and ( b ) final graphs :    @xmath165{stardefinition}\\ ] ]    [ thm : the same graph ] let @xmath91 be a strongly multilinear monomial and let @xmath141 be a @xmath5permutation of @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath107 is a path transformation of @xmath91 if and only if @xmath91 and @xmath141 have the same graph .",
    "we will in fact prove that @xmath91 and @xmath141 have the same graph if and only if condition ( 2 ) of the definition of path transformation is satisfied .",
    "it follows from the discussion following the definition of the graph associated to a monomial that to say that the monomials @xmath91 and @xmath141 have the same graph is the same as saying that in the graph of @xmath91 there is an eulerian path starting at @xmath152 such that the resulting monomial ( where you use @xmath166 if your path reverses the direction of the @xmath98-th edge ) is the monomial @xmath141 . by the definition of the graph , in any path from @xmath152 to a vertex @xmath128 the product of the weights along the path ( where you replace @xmath167 by @xmath168 if you reverse the direction of an edge ) is equal to @xmath128 .",
    "so assume @xmath91 and @xmath141 give the same graph , so that @xmath141 determines a path on the graph of @xmath91 .",
    "we that for each @xmath98 the equality of condition ( 2 ) arises from two paths from @xmath152 to the beginning point of the @xmath98-th edge . to prove the claim we consider the four cases arising for the possible choices for @xmath169 and @xmath170 . if @xmath171 , then because @xmath113 we see that the claim is clear : both sides represent the products of weights in a path from @xmath152 to the beginning point of the @xmath98-th edge . if @xmath172 and @xmath118 then the left hand side is again the product of the weights of the edges ending at the beginning point of the @xmath98-th edge . on the right hand side",
    "because the last term is @xmath173 , the path reverses the direction of @xmath174 ( recall @xmath113 and so the path ends at the point of the @xmath98-th edge , as claimed ) .",
    "the other two cases are similar .",
    "the converse works the same way : we need to show that the edge labeled @xmath98 in the graph of @xmath91 is in the same place in the graph of @xmath141 ( by definition of the graph of a monomial , the edge labeled @xmath98 has weight @xmath174 in both graphs ) .",
    "it is enough to show that the edge labeled @xmath98 has the same beginning vertex in both graphs .",
    "but for each @xmath98 the equation of ( 2 ) says exactly that : the product on the left is the group value of the beginning vertex of the edge labeled @xmath98 in the graph for @xmath91 and the product on the right is the group value of the beginning vertex of the edge labeled @xmath98 in the graph of @xmath141 .    in the definition of path transformation , definition [ pathtransformation ] , condition ( 2 ) implies condition ( 1 ) .    in the proof of the theorem we proved that @xmath91 and @xmath141 have the same graph if and only if condition ( 2 ) is satisfied",
    "but if they have the same graph then the ending vertices of the path for @xmath91 and the path for @xmath141 must be the same : it is either @xmath152 or the only vertex other that @xmath152 at which there are an odd number of edges either beginning or ending there .",
    "the group value of this final vertex is then the common value for condition ( 1 ) .",
    "here is another way to state the theorem : given the graph of @xmath150 , one obtains all the monomials @xmath103 such that @xmath175 is a graded @xmath5identity as follows : look for ( nondirected ) eulerian paths through the graph of @xmath91 starting at e. given such a path you associate the monomial @xmath103 which has the same variables as @xmath91 in the order determined by the new path and for which @xmath176 now has the same exponent @xmath64 as @xmath91 if the direction of the corresponding edge is the same as for @xmath91 and has the other choice for @xmath64 ( that is , if the old @xmath64 was nothing the new one is * and if the old was * the new is nothing ) if the direction of the edge is reversed .",
    "here is an example :    on 2 by 2 matrices with the @xmath48 crossed - product grading you start with the graph of the monomial @xmath177 .",
    "so your path is edge 1 followed by edge 2 followed by edge 3 .",
    "you look at a new path ( ignoring directions of the 3 edges ) going edge 1 followed by edge 3 followed by edge 2 .",
    "the new monomial is @xmath178 because you reversed the directions of edges 2 and 3 .",
    "the difference @xmath179 is a graded identity .",
    "here is another example :    on 6 by 6 matrices with the @xmath180 crossed - product grading you start with the monomial @xmath181 .",
    "if you draw the graph of this monomial you see that the endpoint is @xmath182 .",
    "there are many other paths from @xmath152 to @xmath182 ( ignoring the directions of the edges ) .",
    "for example there is a path @xmath183 where the @xmath5 means that the direction for that edge is reversed .",
    "so we get the binomial graded identity @xmath184 .",
    "[ generators ] let @xmath0 be a group of order @xmath1 .",

    "if edge 3 or edge @xmath214 appears before edge 1 , then as above we can first reduce to the case where edge 3 appears before edge 1 .",
    "we then have two path segments from e to the beginning vertex of edge 3 .",
    "the first is the initial path segment that ends just before edge 3 and the second is the path segment that begins at the beginning of edge 1 ( that is , at e ) and ends just after edge 2 . switching these two segments puts edge 1 back at the beginning of the path .",
    "continuing in this way , whenever we have edge k or edge k@xmath215 appearing before edge 1 and edge 1 appearing before edge k-1 we can apply basic moves to put edge 1 at the beginning of the path .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
