    "the properties of strongly correlated electrons confined to a ladder ( or double chain ) and described by @xmath0-@xmath1 or hubbard models have been the subject of intensive investigation recently .",
    "the reason lies in the unusual spin liquid nature of the undoped parent system .",
    "another reason for especial interest is weakly coupled ladders compounds like @xmath7 and @xmath8.@xcite recent measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and the nuclear spin relaxation rate in these materials show the existence of a finite spin gap .",
    "the key question in the current study is the evolution of the finite gap in the spin excitation spectrum upon doping .",
    "the spin gap remains in other spin liquids systems and is a sign of strong superconducting fluctuations.@xcite    a recent analysis of the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder using a mean - field theory with gutzwiller renormalization of the matrix elements to account for the strong correlations , gave a continuous evolution of the spin gap with doping.@xcite the short range resonance valence bond ( rvb ) state evolves into a superconductor with modified @xmath4-wave symmetry within this mean - field approximation .",
    "a tendency towards modified @xmath4-wave superconductivity was also found in a bosonization approach@xcite and in a recent numerical study of the hubbard ladder.@xcite    we have investigated @xmath0-@xmath1 ladders up to a size of @xmath9 sites using a lanczos diagonalization method .",
    "first results have been published in ref .  .",
    "here we report in more detail our results for larger lattices including a detailed investigation of the excitation spectrum , a discussion of phase separation and the calculation of the superconducting order parameter and of the form factor of the cooper pairs .",
    "we find clear evidence of hole pairing and a modified @xmath4-wave rvb state in lightly doped systems in agreement with the mean - field theory .",
    "an interesting difference however is the discontinuous evolution of the excitation spectrum upon doping .",
    "quasiparticle \" excitations appear carrying both charge and spin .",
    "these excitations are in addition to a band of magnons which evolve continuously away from the undoped spin liquid .",
    "this separation of the excitation spectrum into bound holon - spinon quasiparticles and collective magnon excitation contrasts with the full spin - charge separation found in a luttinger liquid .",

    "the strong coupling limit @xmath27 is a good starting point to describe the system as there a simple description of the spectrum is available.@xcite in that limit , each eigenfunction of the total system can be written as a direct product of one - rung states , which are either spin singlets or one of the triplets , and the ground state is that with all singlets .",
    "the first excited multiplet consists of the states with one triplet rung",

    "the one - magnon excitations then form a three - fold spin degenerate band with dispersion @xmath28 up to second order in @xmath1 .",
    "it has a minimum gap @xmath29 at @xmath30.@xcite the momentum perpendicular to the chains is @xmath31 .",
    "the higher excited states form a continuum of excited states and its minimum is at @xmath32 with energies slightly larger than twice the gap @xmath33 . with increasing @xmath1",
    "the collective excitation branch crosses into the continuum , but the qualitative description is still valid .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of doping holes into such a ladder .",
    "although the isotropic case , @xmath34 , is of most interest , we also study the limit @xmath35 , which can be easily understood . in this limit",

    "a fully polarized ferromagnetic state at finite doping was found only for @xmath40.@xcite    in this context it is of interest to study the occurrence of ferromagnetism in the ladder models . while the proof by nagaoka @xcite can not be applied to the one - dimensional chain it is valid for the ladder .",
    "the proof relies on the existence of closed loops on the lattice .",
    "such loops exist in 2d lattices and on ladders , but can not be formed on single chains .",
    "the ground state of the ladder doped with one hole is thus ferromagnetic .",

    "we find that the ground state is always ferromagnetic for apbc and an even number of rungs and for pbc and an odd number of rungs .",
    "for the other boundary conditions the ground state is a spin singlet .",

    "extrapolations of our small - cluster results at finite doping to the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 are hard to obtain .",
    "but one may speculate that the existence of a ferromagnetic ground state of the @xmath0-ladder with 2 holes and @xmath46 could indicate a ferromagnetic state for dopings @xmath47 .",
    "similar results were obtained by hirsch and mller - hartmann.@xcite",
    "in this section we will discuss the pairing of holes doped into the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder and the occurrence of phase separation at large values of @xmath3 .",
    "we will start from the simple limit @xmath48 . in this limit",
    "the undoped ladder consists of weakly coupled rungs , as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong_limit](a ) .    in this limit",

    "we find that even at isotropic coupling the holes still form a bound pair , although the pair is more spread out there .",
    "the binding energy @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ground state energy for @xmath53 electrons , the boundary conditions are chosen between pbc and apbc to give the lowest energy .    in the large @xmath49 region",
    "the binding energy can easily be estimated .",
    "a single hole doped into a heisenberg ladder breaks one bond with energy loss @xmath49 , but can gain kinetic energy @xmath54 along the ladder ( see the next section for details ) and @xmath55 along the rung .",
    "it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "two holes on the same rung also break one bond , but the kinetic energy of such a bound pair is much smaller , of order @xmath57 , as will be calculated later .",
    "thus we estimate @xmath58 , and a binding energy : @xmath59    figure [ fig : gaps ] shows @xmath50 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "it remains positive and thus shows binding down to the isotropic value , @xmath60 .",
    "the same holds for a larger @xmath61 .    additional evidence for pairing is provided by the hole - hole correlation functions @xmath62 measured on the same leg @xmath63 and on different legs @xmath64 in the ground state .",

    "[ fig : hole_corr ] for @xmath65 and @xmath34 and @xmath66 . for @xmath67",
    "the two holes are predominantly on the same rung and the correlation function shows a clear exponential decay . at the isotropic point the pair is more extended .",
    "the maximum of the correlation function is now at a distance 1 along the legs and on different legs , but it again decays at large distances . we can calculate the size of the hole pair by fitting the inter - chain correlations to an exponential form @xmath68 for the two largest distances , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hole_corr ] shows the size @xmath71 of the hole pair as a function of the inter - chain coupling @xmath72 .",
    "the pair is very tightly bound for @xmath73 . at the isotropic",

    "note the oscillation of the radius with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the size seems to converge to a value in between the @xmath74 and the @xmath43 result at the isotropic point .",
    "we may say that the system belongs to the luther - emery universality class of 1d correlated systems,@xcite in the sense that the spin excitations acquire a finite gap while the charge excitations remain gapless . in the limit of large @xmath49",
    ", however , the picture that tightly bound hole pairs are moving in a background of singlet rungs is more appropriate than weak coupling approaches like @xmath75-ology . considering these hole pairs as hard core bosons",
    ", we can determine the long - range correlations by a mapping to an effective boson model .",
    "the pair hopping matrix element to second order in perturbation theory is @xmath76 there is a weak attraction @xmath77 between two hole pairs on neighboring rungs , which again to second order takes the form @xmath78 where the first , attractive , term comes from the charge part of the @xmath1-term in the hamiltonian .",
    "as @xmath79 we can map the low - energy part of the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder onto an effective hard - core boson model on a chain with nearest neighbor interaction : @xmath80 where the hard - core boson creation operator @xmath81 creates a hole pair at the rung @xmath82 and @xmath83 is its number operator . there is a hard - core repulsion since only one hole pair can be created on any given rung .",
    "our effective boson model is equivalent to the xxz - model in a magnetic field , which has been solved exactly by a bosonization approach and conformal field theory.@xcite for @xmath84 the system is phase separated .",
    "this is the case for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 again to second order perturbation theory . for physically reasonable values of @xmath3 phase separation",
    "occurs only at very large values of @xmath49 : @xmath87 for @xmath65 and @xmath88 for @xmath61 .",
    "note that the dominant attractive part of the interaction comes from the charge part @xmath89 of the @xmath1-term .",
    "next we will discuss the region where the system is not yet phase separated but @xmath49 is still large ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "there we can determine the dominant correlations from the effective boson model .",
    "the correlation exponents have been calculated indirectly by bethe ansatz.@xcite both the charge density wave correlations and the superconducting correlations show a power - law decay at large distances :    @xmath91    the superconducting correlations @xmath92 are dominant if @xmath93 .",
    "this is the case for most of the phase diagram , except for the phase separation regime at @xmath94 . at quarter",
    "filling @xmath95 and for @xmath96 the system is in the ising - limit and shows a long range charge density wave ground state . at fillings close to that line and for large @xmath96",
    "there is a small region where @xmath97.@xcite    in our effective model we have @xmath98 and there @xmath99.@xcite we are thus always in the region of dominant superconducting correlations . even neglecting the attractive charge part of the @xmath1-term we are still in the superconducting regime where @xmath93 .    in the limit of large @xmath49",
    "the equivalence of the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder with a luther - emery liquid can clearly be seen .",
    "going to isotropic coupling the spin gap remains finite and the only low - lying excitation is the collective charge mode , as we will show in the following sections .",
    "thus also at isotropic coupling the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder is still a luther - emery liquid . in sec .",
    "[ sec : map ] , we will develop another approach which relates the long - range correlations to thermodynamic quantities for more general @xmath1 s , based on a bosonization of density fluctuations .",
    "finally we study the occurrence of phase separation at isotropic coupling @xmath36 .",
    "we estimate the onset of phase separation by determining the coupling @xmath1 at which the compressibility @xmath100 diverges .",
    "the compressibility per site can be calculated as usual @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the energy density per site of the ladder with a particle density per site @xmath103 .    in a finite system",
    "usually the discrete version @xmath104 \\label{eq : kappaf}\\ ] ] is used , where @xmath105 is the ground state energy of the finite system with @xmath53 particles on the ladder with @xmath12 rungs ( volume @xmath106 ) . at small hole doping",
    "however this procedure may not be reliable due to finite size effects caused by frustration on small lattices . to see this",
    "let us consider the @xmath74 ladder doped with zero , two or four holes . in the undoped case",
    "there are 8 spins on each leg of the ladder .",
    "two holes doped into the ladder will predominantly go onto different legs and there will be seven spins per leg .",
    "thus the antiferromagnetic configuration on the legs will be frustrated . for four holes",
    "there will be six holes on each leg and the system is again not frustrated .",
    "conversely on an @xmath107 ladder the undoped ladder and the ladder doped with four holes will be frustrated , while the ladder doped with two holes will be non - frustrated .",
    "we have thus used a different formula to calculate the compressibility at small hole doping .",
    "we calculate the ground state energies for an @xmath74 ladder doped with @xmath108 and @xmath109 holes and for an @xmath107 ladder doped with @xmath110 and @xmath111 holes .",
    "in all these cases the ladder is not frustrated .",
    "then we estimate the compressibility from these energies using finite differences similar to the above eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappaf ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45",
    "both formulas give the same result , as the frustration appears only on small lattices .    while the finite size effects are quite small at low electron densities they are much larger at small hole dopings due to frustration mentioned before .",
    "the estimated errors on the phase separation line may thus be much larger there , about @xmath112 .",
    "a comparison with the results obtained with open boundary conditions ( obc ) confirms our results . only at small doping the obc results are not reliable since there",
    "the holes are trapped on the ends of the chain .",
    "figure [ fig : phasesep ] shows the phase separation line for the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder for @xmath36 , in the @xmath1-@xmath113 plane .",
    "note that , opposite to the single chain case,@xcite the onset of phase separation at small hole doping is at lower values of @xmath3 than at small electron concentrations .",
    "this resembles the behavior in two dimensions,@xcite although the precise position of the phase separation line in two dimensions has not yet been established .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the ground state of the ladder doped with two holes . in order to understand the low energy excitations of the ladder",
    "it is useful to study the one - hole problem first .",
    "as mentioned above the limit @xmath48 is a good starting point to explore the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder .",
    "there are nine different states , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nine_basis ] .",
    "a single electron goes either into the bonding or antibonding orbital @xmath114 with energy @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "two electrons on the rung are either in the singlet state with energy @xmath116 or in one of the three triplet states with energy  @xmath23 .",
    "the singlet state expressed in bonding and antibonding orbitals is @xmath117 similarly the three triplets can be expressed as combinations of one bonding and one antibonding electron : @xmath118    figures [ fig : disp_1h](a ) and ( b ) show the one - hole spectra for @xmath74 for large inter - chain coupling @xmath119 , calculated by exact diagonalization for @xmath65 , @xmath120 and @xmath61 , @xmath121 respectively .",
    "a hole on a single rung can be either in the bonding or the antibonding orbital .",
    "one hole doped into the half filled ladder will thus be either in a bonding or antibonding state , depending on the parity symmetry of the total ladder [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : strong_limit](b ) ] .",
    "this hole can propagate along the ladder with a hopping matrix element @xmath122 in first order perturbation theory .",
    "thus the low energy states are two bands of holes in the bonding and anti - bonding orbitals .",
    "they are split by the energy difference @xmath123 of the bonding and antibonding states .",
    "these two bands can clearly be seen in the spectra [ figs .",
    "[ fig : disp_1h](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the minimum of the bands is at @xmath30 , since the hopping matrix element for holes @xmath124 .",
    "the bandwidth of both bands is @xmath125 in the limit @xmath48 . at finite @xmath1 the bandwidth",
    "is reduced due to hybridization with the higher excited states .",

    "@xmath133 is the ground state energy of the undoped ladder and @xmath134 the shift in energy of the center of the band upon doping . in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp_fit ] we show the bands and the excellent fit .",
    "the parameters are shown in table [ tab : fitspec ] .",
    "the changes in the hole dispersion with decreasing @xmath49 are summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the center of the bands shifts downwards by @xmath135 , compared to the undoped ladder . the energy gain for one hole in the case of @xmath2",

    "when @xmath136 we lose magnetic energy by introducing the hole .",
    "the energy gain is therefore smaller at larger @xmath3 , as we can also see from the fit parameters .",

    "[ sec : chargexc ] we will identify the minima @xmath140 and @xmath141 with the fermi points of the bonding and antibonding quasiparticle bands .    another interesting question is the behavior of the free spin that is left over after one hole has been doped into the ladder . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain",
    "the spin and charge excitations are carried by different soliton excitations which are far apart in space from each other .",

    "the dispersion relation of a single doped hole consists of two cosine bands corresponding to bonding and antibonding states on a rung .",
    "lowering @xmath49 to the isotropic limit ( @xmath34 ) and setting both @xmath323 changes the dispersion relation substantially .",
    "the coherent parts of both bands are centered at energies @xmath324 but the width is @xmath197 only . the spin and charge components are still bound but more loosely and the large magnetic polarizability of the spin background introduces longer - range hoppings .",
    "remarkably the form of the bands resembles the noninteracting band structure so that a photoemission experiment which removes electrons would measure in effect a large `` fermi surface '' with bonding and antibonding pieces . in this regime",
    "the quasiparticle propagation is strongly influenced by the coupling to magnetic excitations .",
    "when two holes are added they bind together on a single rung at large @xmath49 and remain bound although the size of the bound hole pair increases as @xmath49 approaches @xmath325 .",
    "moreover the qualitative features of the density - density @xmath192 and spin - spin structure factor @xmath181 , which are easy to understand at large @xmath49 , remain similar as @xmath49 approaches @xmath325 .",
    "@xmath192 near @xmath190 is dominated by the low energy mode associated with the motion of hole pairs . at large @xmath194",
    ", @xmath192 has a broad peak at high energies ( @xmath326 ) similar to that found by ohta , eder and maekawa for 2d clusters.@xcite they interpreted this as local excitations of single holes in the magnetic cloud or spin bag.@xcite the dynamical spin structure factor , @xmath181 , also resembles 2d clusters and not 1d chains when we compare to the results of tohyama , horsch and maekawa.@xcite the major weight is at energies @xmath197 .",
    "the spin gap evolves discontinuously upon doping through the new quasiparticle excitations that can be made by breaking a hole pair into two separate single holes .",
    "however the major weight of the spin excitations remains in the collective magnon mode whose dispersion evolves continuously from the @xmath327 limit , although it is influenced by the continuum of quasiparticle excitations .    we have also investigated the one - particle spectral functions to add and remove electrons from the two - hole ground state .",
    "these show clearly the unusual nature of this `` fermi liquid '' . when electrons are removed ( or holes added ) , the spectral weight is spread over a large energy region ( @xmath328 ) , but the coherent part is limited only to energies @xmath197 below the fermi energy @xmath276 .",
    "the energy dispersion relations show a large apparent fermi surface for the coherent quasiparticles and which matches onto a similar one for adding electrons at energies greater than @xmath276 .",
    "these @xmath304-space features resemble a metal with a large fermi surface .",
    "the property that resembles a lightly hole doped insulator is the energy dependence of the spectral weight to add an electron .",
    "this shows a low energy cut - off ( @xmath329 ) similar to a lightly hole doped band insulator . the result is an intriguing duality between metallic - like features in @xmath304-space and",
    "lightly hole doped insulating features in energy space .",
    "the overall properties of the lightly doped ladder place it in the luther - emery class rather than the tomonaga - luttinger class of 1d systems .",
    "the low energy properties of luther - emery liquids are described by interacting hard - core bosons as shown by efetov and larkin . in the present case the efetov - larkin bosons",
    "are bound hole pairs .",
    "two features distinguish the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder from the usual luther - emery liquids arising from attractive interactions .",
    "one is the @xmath4-wave character of the pairing and the second is the presence of magnon excitations and limited quasiparticle excitations . note the magnon excitations can not be viewed as the collective mode of quasiparticles since the latter vanish as @xmath330 .",
    "the system is not a standard fermi liquid , but rather is a new and interesting mixture of a dilute attractive fermi gas in which the hole binding energy remains finite as @xmath330 , and a dense fermi liquid with an apparent large fermi surface in @xmath331-space .    comparing the ladder with the results by tohyama et al . , we see that the ladder is very different from the single chain but similar to 2d clusters in many respects .",
    "both in ladders and in 2d clusters @xmath4-wave pairs are found down to small @xmath3 . the dynamical charge and spin structure factors look remarkably similar and the single - particle spectral functions indicate the existence of bogoliubov quasiparticles with a finite superconducting gap .",
    "thus we are lead to the conjecture that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on 2d clusters is a doped rvb spin liquid showing @xmath4-wave pairing , similar to the ladder .",
