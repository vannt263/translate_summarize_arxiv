    "the coulomb blockade in nanostructures is one of the cornerstones of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "the simplest approach to electron tunneling through quantum dots was proposed by ambegaokar , eckern and schn in @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite their model ( in brief aes model ) became the focus of a stream of experimental and theoretical papers  @xcite following the first experimental indications of `` macroscopic charge quantization '' in single electron devices in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    to experimentally control the transport of electrons  @xcite one generally uses the so - called  single electron transistor \" or set .",
    "@xcite this is a mesoscopic metallic island that is capacitively coupled to a gate and connected to two metallic reservoirs through tunneling contacts with a total conductance @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1]a ) .",
    "the experimental conditions of the aes model are limited and extremely well known .",
    "@xcite the model is nevertheless richly complex and much of the physical consequences have remained unknown . over the years , however , it has slowly become more evident that the aes theory of the coulomb blockade is in many ways similar to the theory of the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite for example , the aes model is asymptotically free in @xmath4 space - time dimension , possesses instantons and has an instanton angle @xmath0 .",
    "this immediately raises the fundamental question whether the experimental phenomenon of  macroscopic charge quantization \" in the set is possibly related to the  robust quantization \" of the hall conductance observed on very different electronic systems .",
    "the aes model has a number of very significant advantages as compared to the more conventional theories of the @xmath0 vacuum or instanton vacuum .",
    "for example , the winding numbers of the theory (  topological charge \" ) are quantized at the outset of the problem .",
    "this is quite unlike the usual situation where the historical controversies in quantum field theory continue to haunt the subject .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out only very recently that the @xmath0 vacuum concept generally displays ",
    "massless chiral edge excitations \" that are very different from those in the  bulk \" of the system .",
    "disentwining these different types of excitation is synonymous for separating the _ fractional _ topological sectors of the theory from the _ integral _ ones .",
    "remarkably , it turns out the existence of  massless chiral edge excitations \" in the problem automatically reveals the existence of the quantum hall effect .",
    "this fundamental phenomenon previously remained concealed .",
    "however , it provides the resolution to longstanding problems such as the quantization of topological charge , the meaning of instantons and instanton gases etc .",
    "the existence of  massless chiral edge excitations \" has furthermore led to the idea of  super universality \" which states that all the fundamental features of the instanton vacuum concept are precisely those of the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite these include not only the robust quantization of the hall conductance but also the existence of  gapless excitations \" at @xmath5 or , equivalently ,  quantum criticality \" of the quantum hall plateau transition .",
    "it is of interest to know whether these new advances possibly also apply to the aes model . in this case , the microscopic origins of the integral and fractional topological sectors are far more obvious .",
    "for example , the integral sectors directly emerge from quantum statistics and they describe the quantum system ( set ) in thermal equilibrium . on the other hand , the fractional topological sectors do not describe  edge \" excitations but , rather , they have the meaning of perturbing external fields that take the set out of thermal equilibrium . the great advantage of the aes model , however , is that the @xmath0 dependence can be studied on the strong coupling side .",
    "the aes model is therefore an outstanding laboratory where the various different aspects of  super universality \" can be explored and investigated in great detail .",
    "it should be mentioned that the aes model in a different context is also known as the `` circular brane model . ''",
    "@xcite it is furthermore of direct physical interest in the theory of granular metals at intermediate temperatures .  @xcite      the phrase ",
    "macroscopic charge quantization \" usually refers to the charge of an isolated island that is disconnected from the reservoirs .",
    "it is given by the naive strong coupling limit of the aes model where the tunneling conductance @xmath3 is put equal to zero .",
    "this naive approach leads to the electrostatic picture of the coulomb blockade where the average charge ( @xmath6 ) on the island is _",
    "robustly _ quantized in units of @xmath7 as the temperature ( @xmath8 ) goes to absolute zero .",
    "this quantization breaks down for very special values of the gate voltage @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an integer and @xmath11 denotes the gate capacitance . at these very special values of @xmath12 a first order _ quantum phase transition _ occurs separating two different phases with @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the electrostatic picture of the coulomb blockade gets fundamentally complicated when the tunneling conductance @xmath3 is finite .",
    "it is well known , for example , that due to the strong charge fluctuations in the set the averaged charge @xmath6 on the island is generally _",
    "un_-quantized .",
    "@xcite despite the impressive list of existing theoretical work on both the strong coupling side  @xcite ( @xmath15 ) and weak coupling side  @xcite ( @xmath16 ) of the problem it is not known what the electrostatic or semi classical picture of the set exactly stands for .",
    "this fundamental drawback clearly upsets the concept of  robust charge quantization \" in single electron devices .",
    "the main objective of this investigation is to show that the set displays macroscopic charge quantization in much the same way as the two dimensional electron gas displays the quantum hall effect .",
    "we develop a complete quantum theory of the set and introduce a unifying scaling diagram that spans the entire range from weak to strong coupling .",
    "we benefit from the advances made over the years in the theory of the quantum hall effect .",
    "we introduce , in particular , the  physical observables \" of the aes theory that measure the sensitivity of the set to changes in the boundary conditions . in the present context",
    "this means that the quantum system is taken out of thermal equilibrium by perturbing fields .",
    "the main problem to be solved is how to lay the bridge between the sensitivity to the boundary conditions on the one hand , and the standard expressions for linear response obtained from the kubo formalism on the other .",
    "to start we briefly review the microscopic origins of the aes model and summarize the results known from previous work in section [ sec : aes ] .    to see the concept of  physical observables \" at work we consider in section [ sec : phys ] the trivial case of an isolated island at finite @xmath8 obtained by putting the tunneling conductance @xmath3 equal to zero .",
    "this simple but instructive example sets the stage for most of the analysis in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we point out , first of all , that the averaged charge @xmath6 on the isolated island is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to changes in the boundary conditions .",
    "this notion immediately suggests a generalized thouless criterion that relates the robust quantization of @xmath6 on the island to the appearance of an energy gap .",
    "secondly , we show how the renormalization behavior of @xmath6 at finite @xmath8 provides a complete knowledge of the low energy dynamics of the isolated island .",
    "this behavior involves two different kinds of fixed points , i.e. stable ones at @xmath13 which describe the robust quantization of charge as @xmath8 goes to zero , and unstable ones at @xmath17 describing the transition between the states @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the island .",
    "armed with the insights obtained from the isolated island we next embark on the general problem with finite @xmath3 in section  [ kubo ] .",
    "we introduce two slightly different but physically equivalent sets of response parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the different expressions that we obtain stem from slightly different ways of handling the fractional topological sectors of the aes theory .",
    "the first set is the simpler one which is a direct generalization of the results obtained for an isolated island .",
    "the second set is slightly more involved but our findings permit a direct comparison with the expressions obtained from linear response theory .    in both cases ,",
    "however , one may think of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in terms of the sensitivity of the set to changes in the boundary conditions . in both cases also one may think of @xmath18 in terms of the set conductance .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is new and in general very different from the conventionally studied averaged charge @xmath6 on the island . within linear response theory",
    "we express @xmath19 in terms of the antisymmetric current - current correlation function .",
    "we identify this new quantity with the previously unrecognized quasi particle charge of the set .    in complete analogy with the theory of the quantum hall effect , we relate the conditions for  macroscopic charge quantization \" @xmath20 and @xmath21 with integer @xmath10 to the appearance of an energy gap in the set . for @xmath22",
    "these conditions are identically the same as those obtained from the electrostatic picture of the set . for finite @xmath3",
    ", however , these conditions describe an entirely different physical state of the set .",
    "they describe the macroscopic quantization of the _ quasi particle charge _ , rather than the _",
    "averaged charge _ on the island .",
    "this takes us to the second part of this investigation where we explicitly compute , in sections  [ sec : weak ] and  [ sec : strong ] , the observable theory @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the various different regimes in @xmath3 of interest .",
    "we benefit from having two different definitions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the different computational schemes provide a direct check on the universal and non - universal parts of the aes theory .    in section",
    "[ sec : weak ] we consider the weak coupling phase @xmath23 of the aes model .",

    "we first map the critical behavior of the aes model onto an effective theory of quantum spins .",
    "we employ abrikosov s pseudo fermion technique and extract the @xmath24 functions of the aes theory near the critical point .",
