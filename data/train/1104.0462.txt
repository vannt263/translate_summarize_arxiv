    "a moonlet embedded in a planetary ring tends to open a gap , such as a keeler or encke gap , due to gravitational scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , viscous diffusion of ring particles tends to close a gap .",
    "if a moonlet is sufficiently large , it will form a fully circular gap , whereas a small moonlet will form only a partial gap that consists of two azimuthally aligned lobes shaped like a propeller ( hereafter , we refer to this structure as a propeller ) . using the viscous fluid model , @xcite and @xcite predicted the formation of propellers by small moonlets .",

    "we consider the self - gravity of ring particles and calculate it by directly summing the gravitational interactions of all pairs .",

    "figure [ fig : tau10 ] shows a snapshot of the high surface density model at @xmath61 . strong gravitational wakes form and no propeller structure is clearly observed .",
    "the ratio of the time - averaged surface density in the propeller region to the initial surface density @xmath58 is @xmath62 .",
    "the gravitational wakes seem to be almost unaffected by the moonlet .",
    "the typical distance between wakes is approximated by the critical wavelength of gravitational instability @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the ring surface density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the high surface density model ,",
    "the typical distance between wakes is @xmath65 m , which is larger than the hill radius of the moonlet .",
    "the numerical simulation results indicate that propeller formation depends on the surface density .",
    "below , we derive the formation condition for propellers and confirm its validity by performing @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the clumps in gravitational wakes typically have a mass of @xmath66 .",
    "if the clump mass is greater than the moonlet mass @xmath17 , the gravitational wakes may not be affected by gravitational scattering due to the moonlet .",
    "comparing the clump mass with the moonlet mass , we obtain the following condition for propeller formation @xmath67 note that this condition can also be derived by comparing the typical velocity due to scattering by the moonlet with the velocity dispersion of ring particles @xcite .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of particles exceeds the hill velocity @xmath68 , which is a typical velocity due to scattering by the moonlet , the gravitational wake should be almost unaffected by the moonlet .",
    "the velocity dispersion of ring particles @xmath33 is determined by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath68 is about @xmath69 .    using the moonlet radius and the ring surface density , equation ( [ eq : condition ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the non - dimensional constant of order unity ( see discussion below ) and @xmath72 and @xmath24 are respectively the density and radius of the moonlet .    to check the validity of this condition , we perform @xmath0-body simulations for various @xmath64 and @xmath24 .",
    "to investigate a wide range of @xmath64 , we adopt equal - sized ( 10 m ) ring particles , which reduces the number of particles .",
    "the density of particles is @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that the restitution coefficient is constant at @xmath74 .",
    "the moonlet density is @xmath75 .",
    "we perform 25 simulations with different ring surface densities and moonlet radii .",
    "we vary the moonlet radius from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and the surface density from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "the ratio of the radius to the hill radius is 0.64 .",
    "the simulation time is @xmath80 .",
    "we consider that a propeller forms if @xmath81 in the propeller region .",
    "we confirmed that a propeller - shaped structure is clearly observed when this condition is satisfied .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , no distinct steady propeller structure is observed ( although the ring particles are affected by the moonlet to some extent ) .",
    "figure [ fig : summary.eps ] summarizes the results .",
    "it clearly shows that equation ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) is consistent with the simulation results .",
    "we find that @xmath82 explains the @xmath83 boundary well .",
    "we also find that @xmath71 is approximately proportional to the boundary value of @xmath58 .    for a moonlet with a radius of @xmath84 and a density of @xmath35 ,",
    "the critical surface density is @xmath85 . in the low surface density model ,",
    "the surface density is @xmath86 , which is smaller than the critical value . in this case , a propeller is clearly observed . on the other hand , in the high surface density model ,",
    "since the surface density is @xmath87 , which is greater than the critical value , a gravitational wake prevails over a propeller .",
    "consequently , no propeller is observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : a - sigma ] shows the critical surface density plotted as a function of distance from saturn for moonlets with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , 30 , 100 , and 300 m. since @xmath90 increases with @xmath7 faster than @xmath15 , @xmath91 decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the typical surface density in the a ring is about @xmath92 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming @xmath93 , we obtain the critical moonlet radius for propeller formation to be @xmath94 . known moonlets with propellers have radii ranging from @xmath94 to a kilometer @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) is consistent with this observational data .",
    "note that this condition is not applicable to rings with low surface densities in which gravitational wakes do not develop well . in this case ,",
    "gravitational scattering of individual particles is important and the condition discussed in @xcite should be applicable , namely that propeller formation is controlled by the ratio of the maximum ring particle mass to the moonlet mass .",
    "we have performed local @xmath0-body simulations to investigate the formation of a propeller by a moonlet . by performing real - scale simulations",
    ", we demonstrated that in the b ring a moonlet with radius @xmath95 forms a propeller in a low surface density ring ( @xmath96 ) , whereas it does not in a high surface density ring ( @xmath97 ) in which the ring dynamics are dominated by gravitational wakes .",
    "these results indicate that propeller formation depends on the surface density . comparing the moonlet mass with the typical mass of a gravitational wake , we derived the condition for propeller formation that the characteristic length of the gravitational wakes given by the critical wavelength for gravitational instability be shorter than the hill radius of the moonlet , @xmath98 .",
    "we confirmed this by @xmath0-body simulations . in a ring with gravitational wakes ,",
    "the characteristic length of wakes is more important than the size of individual ring particles since a wake is a coherent structure .",
    "our condition is consistent with observations of propellers in saturn s a ring which revealed observational signatures of gravitational wakes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cassini spacecraft recently discovered a new putative `` moonlet '' in the b ring ( s/2009 s1 ) @xcite .",
    "the diameter of s/2009 s1 is inferred to be 300 m if it is orbiting in the same plane as the ring particles .",
    "its radial distance from the center of saturn is 116,914 km , which is at the outer edge of the b ring @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , no propeller was observed around s/2009 s1 . for s/2009 s1",
    ", the critical surface density for propeller formation is estimated to be @xmath99 , which is higher than the typical surface density of the outer edge of the b ring .",
    "this suggests two possibilities : the surface density around s/2009 s1 is locally high enough to prevent propeller formation or s/2009 s1 is not a moonlet but a transient feature such as meteoroid impact or temporary clumps .",
    "further observation is necessary to determine the nature of s/2009 s1 .    for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the moonlet is fixed .",
    "if the moonlet can move , the moonlet will be scattered by gravitational wakes , which leads to stochastic change in the moonlet orbit @xcite .",
    "this random motion of the moonlet may hinder propeller formation .",
    "it is important to determine the shape of propeller structures to interpret observations .",
    "the shape may depend on various ring parameters such as the ring viscosity and the size distribution of ring particles .",
    "we intend to investigate these problems in a subsequent study .",
    "observations of propeller structures reveal bright regions rather than low - density features such as a propeller gap @xcite .",
    "however , the implied density enhancement near the moonlet has not been observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the brightness enhancement is collisional debris released from ring particles @xcite",
    ". gravitational scattering of ring particles by the moonlet increases the impact velocity between ring particles .",
    "thus , debris may be released from ring particles in the vicinity of the moonlet in high - velocity collisions , which increases the reflectivity . as shown in section [ sec : conf ] , the condition for propeller gap formation is equivalent to that the hill velocity of the moonlet @xmath68 is higher than the velocity dispersion of ring particles .",
    "therefore , it may be applicable to the condition for local debris enhancement .",
    "we intend to study this in the future .",
    "we wish to thank joseph a. burns for stimulating discussions on the observations of propellers by the cassini spacecraft .",
    "e. k. is grateful to the isaac newton institute for mathematical sciences for its hospitality during his visit at the beginning of this study .",
