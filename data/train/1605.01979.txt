    "in recent years , hoava - lifshitz theory @xcite has become a valuable alternative theory of gravity .",
    "the theory is power countable renormalizable @xcite with an anisotropic scaling of the space and time coordinates of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the dynamical critical exponent . when @xmath6 , the lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "however , even not exhibiting relativistic invariance at short distances , general relativity ( gr ) is recovered in the low - energy limit . in cosmological models , hl theory has interesting consequences .",
    "it can solve the horizon and flatness problem and can generate scale invariant perturbations for the early universe even without inflation @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to high orders curvature terms , bouncing and cyclic universes appear as regular solutions @xcite .    in @xmath0-dimensions , the hl action fails to be a topological invariant , giving rise to a dynamical theory @xcite , unlike einstein s gravity , which is nondynamical in two - dimensions .",
    "cosmology in @xmath0-dimensional hl theory was studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that it is very similar to the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite ( where a dilaton scalar field is necessary for dynamics ) , in the sense that the evolution of the scale factor in both cases are the same .",
    "since two - dimensional hl theory is dynamical , it is amenable to quantization .",
    "quantum cosmology is based on the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite , whose solution is the wave function of the universe as a whole . generally , the wheeler - dewitt equation is very difficult to be handled , since it is defined in the superspace of all possible spatial metrics and all possible field configurations .",
    "however , the symmetries of the homogeneous frw universe allows us to freeze out all but a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom can then be quantized by canonical methods .",
    "another problem with the wheeler - dewitt equation is the absence of a natural time .",
    "the hamiltonian constructed using the arnowitt - deser - misner @xcite formalism is a constraint , with no first derivative playing the role of time .",
    "this problem is generally circumvented with the introduction of matter ( a fluid , for example ) in the model . in this way ,",
    "time is measured by a dynamical degree of freedom related to the matter content .",
    "the standard way to introduce a fluid in quantum cosmology is via schutz formalism @xcite .",
    "when applied to frw universe , this formalism gives rise to at least one linear conjugated momentum in the hamiltonian . in this way",
    ", a parameter of time is introduced in the model and a schrdinger - like equation can be obtained .",
    "quantization of the frw universe filled with a perfect fluid in @xmath7-dimensional hl theory was performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that one of the main problems of quantum cosmology , namely , the necessity of a boundary condition for the wheeler - dewitt equation at the big - bang singularity , is solved in hl theory .",
    "the higher order spatial curvature terms in hl quantum cosmology introduce a repulsive potential near @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the scale factor ) which shields the classical singularity so that quantum wave packets simply bounce off this barrier . in @xcite ,",
    "exact solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation were obtained and the expectation value of the scale factor was analyzed , showing a bouncing behavior near the classical singularity .    in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional frw universe was quantized when only gravity is present and when gravity couples to a scalar field .",
    "it was shown that , in both cases , dirac s algorithm works and normalizable wave functions for some operator orderings were exhibited . in this paper ,",
    "the minisuperspace model of frw universe filled with a perfect fluid is quantized .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , which leads to the wheeler - dewitt equation , was already obtained in @xcite .",
    "it depends on the scale factor @xmath9 , its conjugated momentum @xmath10 and the conjugated momentum @xmath11 of a dynamical degree of freedom of the fluid .",
    "however , unlike in standard quantum mechanics , the hamiltonian constraint in frw models does not lead to a unique ordering due to the non - commutativity of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "different orderings give rise to different transitions between the classical and the quantum theory . by some physical motivation",
    ", one must choose a specific operator ordering . here",
    "i show that , with a particular operator ordering , the wheeler - dewitt equation is in sturm - liouville form . by performing a liouville transformation to this equation , an equivalent schrdinger equation is found and its characteristic potential is analyzed . for a radiation fluid with eos @xmath14",
    ", the wave function of the universe satisfies the free particle schrdinger equation when the cosmological constant @xmath15 is null . when @xmath16 , an exponential ( liouville ) potential appears . for @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ", the schrdinger equation has a characteristic inverse square potential , in addition to a regular polynomial , which depends on the eos .",
    "unlike the @xmath7-dimensional case , there is an infinite number of possible boundary conditions . in order to find explicit solutions for some solvable cases ,",

    "this section is based on refs . @xcite and @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , i will proceed with the canonical quantization of the model , by finding a schrdinger - like equation which comes from the hamiltonian constraint by means of a particular choice of operator ordering . by performing a liouville transformation to this equation",
    ", the correspondent schrdinger equation will be found and analyzed . in sec .",
    "iv , some interesting solvable cases will be studied and the evolution of the expectation value of the scale factor will be found .",
    "a comparison between the quantum and the classical predictions will be made .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains my final considerations .",
    "the anisotropic scaling of space and time in hl theory breaks lorentz invariance . in this way , the hl action is no longer a topological invariance and the theory is dynamical . since gr is recovered in the low energy limit , the matter content will be introduced in the model as in general relativity , i.e. , via schutz formalism of perfect fluids coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "then , the total action will be given by @xmath17 , in which @xmath18 denotes the action of the frw minisuperspace in hl theory and @xmath19 denotes the action of the matter content .",
    "given the total action , the hamiltonian constraint can be obtained by canonical methods .",
    "following dirac s algorithm of quantization , we associate to this hamiltonian constraint an operator which annihilates the wave function of the universe . due to the matter",

    "the kinetic term depends on the extrinsic curvature @xmath25 of the constant leaves @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a dimensionless constant .",

    "for the matter content , the action of a perfect fluid coupled to gravity in schutz formalism @xcite is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fluid s pressure , which in turn is related to the fluid s density by the eos @xmath1 .",
