    "derivations of the orbit equation in the kepler problem traditionally begin with a reduction to motion in a plane via conservation of angular momentum .",
    "this simple , appealing , and effective step is immediate from the rotational symmetry of the force law .",
    "what if it were possible similarly to `` read off '' from the form of the equations of motion that solutions must be confined to the surface of certain cones ? at the least , this would provide a pedagogically appealing demonstration of the conic section nature of orbits , and , moreover , one that is faithful to the provenance of these curves in solid geometry .",
    "in this paper we study the cones and cylinders of keplerian orbits .",
    "for example , we show in section 4 that orbits of energy @xmath0 lie on the surface of either of two cylinders with axes that pass through the center of the orbit in the direction of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angular momentum vector , @xmath3 is the mass , and @xmath4 is the laplace - runge - lenz vector .",
    "a conic section uniquely determines the plane in which it lies , but there are infinitely many cones which intersect with a plane to produce a given conic section .",
    "it turns out that the locus of vertices of all such cones forms another conic section in a plane perpendicular to the original plane , and with an eccentricity equal to the reciprocal of the eccentricity of the original conic section .",
    "we provide complete and self - contained proofs of these rather striking facts in section 2 below . in section 3",
    "we recall the kepler problem and give rigorous proofs of some qualitative results about orbits .",
    "section 4 is devoted to characterizing the cones and cylinders of planetary orbits in terms of initial conditions , and in section 5 we calculate the location of the cylinder axes for the earth s orbit .",
    "probably nothing in this paper is new .",
    "( how could there be anything new to discover about conic sections or the kepler problem ? ) modern textbooks , however , invariably view conic sections as planar curves , perhaps to the detriment of some very pretty mathematics that only comes into focus when these curves are viewed in a fully 3 dimensional context .",
    "we certainly do not claim our approach is pedagogically superior to any of the more standard ones , but hope that it may have some interest .    throughout the paper we use bold face for vector quantities .",
    "scalar quantities , and , in particular , the magnitude of a vector , are given in normal typeface .",
    "thus , the magnitude of @xmath5 is @xmath6 dots over variables indicate derivatives with respect to time .",
    "let e be an ellipse , considered as a point subset of 3 dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the ellipse uniquely determines the plane , @xmath7 that contains it . for study of the plane geometric properties of e",
    "it is convenient to adopt as definition of an ellipse the following :    an ellipse is the locus of points in the plane , the sum of whose distances from a given pair of distinct points @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( its foci ) is equal to a given positive constant .",
    "( it is customary to include the circle as a degenerate case of the ellipse . )    to state the definition of ellipse as a conic section , it is necessary to clarify some terminology and notation .",
    "first , by the word _ cone _",
    "we shall always mean `` right circular cone . ''",
    "more precisely , given a line a and a point on it , v , the cone c with _",
    "v and _ axis _ a is the locus of points p such that the smaller positive angle from segment @xmath10 to line a has a fixed positive value .",
    "the lines @xmath10 are called _ generators _ of c. the maximum plane angle , @xmath11 between two generators is a characteristic of c that does not appear to have a standard name .",
    "we shall take the liberty of coining the term _ bloom _ for the angle @xmath12    a cone c may naturally be divided into 3 disjoint subsets : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are congruent connected sets .",
    "if a has an orientation , designate the _ nappes _ @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the obviously consistent way ; otherwise , choose them indifferently .",
    "the definition of ellipse as conic section follows :    an ellipse is the locus of intersection of a given cone c and a given plane that is not parallel to any generator of c , provided the plane meets only one nappe of c.    we shall call the cones c having @xmath17 the cones _ belonging to e_. our goal in this section is to characterize the set of cones belonging to a given ellipse .    for an ellipse , represented as",
    "the intersection of a cone c and a plane @xmath18 , a _ dandelin sphere _ is a sphere centered on the axis a of c , which meets one nappe of c in a circle centered on a , and which meets @xmath18 in exactly one point .",
    "a given ellipse with accompanying cone has exactly two dandelin spheres lying on opposite sides of @xmath18 .",
    "a standard use of dandelin spheres ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is to derive definition 2.1 as a consequence of definition 2.2 , yielding along the way the fact that the points of intersection of @xmath18 with the dandelin spheres are the foci of e. we use them in a similar way to prove    let e be an ellipse lying in a plane @xmath18 with foci @xmath8 and @xmath19 the locus of vertices of cones belonging to e is a subset of the unique plane @xmath20 through line @xmath21 and perpendicular to @xmath22    let c be a cone belonging to e. let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the two dandelin spheres , which meet @xmath18 in points @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the respective centers of these spheres .",
    "since each sphere is tangent to @xmath7 it follows that the lines @xmath27 and @xmath28 are each perpendicular to @xmath22 therefore these lines are parallel to each other , and since they are distinct , they determine a unique plane @xmath20 .",
    "since both @xmath25 and @xmath26 lie in @xmath20 , it follows that the axis of c is a subset of @xmath29 in particular , the vertex of c lies in @xmath29 the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath20 are perpendicular to each other is immediate from the construction of @xmath29    let e be an ellipse as in theorem 2.1 .",
    "let segment @xmath30 be the major axis of e , and determine the plane @xmath20 as in theorem 2.1 .",
    "then the vertices of cones belonging to e lie on the hyperbola in @xmath20 having foci a and p and vertices at @xmath8 and @xmath19    2.5 in    _ proof .",
    "_ let c be a cone belonging to e with vertex v. refer to figure 1 , in which the plane of the figure corresponds to @xmath29 the circle there represents the intersection of @xmath20 with one of the dandelin spheres of e. point f represents one of the foci of e , and points g and h represent points of contact between the dandelin sphere and c. since circle fgh is the incircle of triangle apv , its center o is at the intersection of the bisectors of the internal angles of apv .",
    "denoting by @xmath31 the length of segment @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 therefore , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the eccentricity of e , and @xmath37 is the semi - major axis of e. since the difference of distances from all such v to the points a and p is constant , it follows that the locus of points v lies on the stated hyperbola .",
    "@xmath38    denote by @xmath39 the hyperbola of theorem 2.2 .",
    "it has foci at a and p , one vertex at f , and eccentricity @xmath40 the other vertex of @xmath39 is at the other focus of e. ( the excircle of triangle apv , having center at the intersection of @xmath41 and the bisectors of the exterior angles of apv at a and p , touches @xmath30 at the other vertex of @xmath39 , and is also the intersection with @xmath20 of the other dandelin sphere of e. )    2.5 in    next we show that every point of the hyperbola @xmath42 except for its vertices , is the vertex of some cone belonging to e. consider such a point v lying on the branch of @xmath39 through f. assume @xmath43 , the contrary case being similar .",
    "construct triangle apv in @xmath20 , and its incircle @xmath44 centered at @xmath45 , as in figure 2 .    by the same reasoning as in the proof of theorem 2.2 ,",
    "we have    @xmath46    in particular , @xmath47    let c be the cone with vertex v , axis @xmath48 , and generators @xmath49 and @xmath50 the intersection of c with @xmath18 is an ellipse ( by definition 2.2 ) , and this ellipse has the sphere with center @xmath45 and radius @xmath51 as one of its dandelin spheres .",
    "it also has @xmath30 as major axis .",
    "let @xmath52 be the eccentricity of this ellipse .",
    "then it follows from ( 2.1 ) that @xmath53 thus e = @xmath54 and v is the vertex of a cone belonging to e.    the following theorem summarizes much of the foregoing :    let e be an ellipse with eccentricity @xmath55 lying in plane @xmath18 and having major axis @xmath56 let @xmath20 be the plane through @xmath30 perpendicular to @xmath22 then for each @xmath57 there are exactly 4 cones of bloom @xmath58 belonging to e. each cone is obtainable from the others by reflection in plane @xmath18 and in the plane through the center of the ellipse perpendicular to both @xmath18 and @xmath29 the vertices of all such cones lie on the hyperbola in @xmath20 having foci at a and p and eccentricity @xmath59 .",
    "the axis of a cone belonging to a non - circular ellipse intersects the major axis in a point that lies strictly between the center of the ellipse and the focus that is nearer to the cone vertex .",
    "referring again to figure 1 , in which f is the focus closest to v , we have @xmath60 hence @xmath61 denoting by j the point of intersection of @xmath41 and @xmath30 , we have @xmath62 to see the left - hand inequality , note that , since the interior angle of apv at p exceeds the angle at a , the interior angle of triangle vjp at j is less than a right angle . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath63 is perpendicular to @xmath56 to see the right - hand inequality , apply the law of sines in triangles ajv and vjp to show that the ratio of @xmath64 to @xmath65 is equal to the ratio of @xmath66 to @xmath67    the intersection of a cylinder and a plane not parallel to the cylinder is also an ellipse .",
    "we shall say that the cylinder belongs to the ellipse .",
    "the following result is the analogue of theorem 2.3 for cylinders .",
    "it may be proved directly or obtained as a limiting case of theorem 2.3 as the bloom tends to zero .",
    "let e be an ellipse with eccentricity @xmath55 .",
    "then there are exactly two cylinders belonging to e. the axes of these cylinders pass through the center of the ellipse and form the asymptotes of the hyperbola of loci of vertices of cones belonging to e.    for completeness , we conclude by stating the analogous results for circles . if e is a circle lying in plane @xmath18 , then there is exactly one cylinder belonging to e. its axis is perpendicular to @xmath18 through the center of e. for each angle @xmath68 there are exactly two cones belonging to e. the vertices of these cones lie on the cylinder axis and are obtained from each other by reflection in @xmath22",
    "according to newtonian mechanics the position vector @xmath69 of a body at time @xmath70 moving under the influence of a coulomb or gravitational source located at the origin satisfies the equations of motion @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a measure of the force per unit mass generated by the source . for sentimental reasons we shall call the source `` the sun '' and the body `` the planet . ''",
    "let @xmath73 be the momentum of the planet , where @xmath3 is its mass .",
    "as is well known , 4 integrals ( conserved quantities ) of the motion can readily be deduced from : the 3 components of the angular momentum @xmath74 and the energy , @xmath75    we shall be concerned here only with negative energy ( @xmath0 ) orbits . such orbits are , as it turns out , generally eccentric ellipses , though there are two annoying special cases : circular orbits and catastrophic ones that plunge straight into the sun .",
    "the latter may be avoided by the assumption @xmath76    if @xmath77 and @xmath0 then we have the following _ a priori _ bounds on @xmath78 and @xmath79 : @xmath80 @xmath81    since @xmath77 , @xmath79 can never vanish .",

    "unfortunately the proper choice of origin and orientation of coordinate axes for such a coordinate system is not obvious , and will have to emerge in the course of the analysis .",

    "to simplify matters , it is convenient to make some initial choices .",
    "first , we continue to assume , as we have above , that @xmath179 and that the orbit is not circular . since @xmath180 vanishes at infinitely many times ( by theorem 3.3 ) , we may and do assume that we have @xmath181 at time @xmath182 .",

    "if @xmath248 then @xmath249 if we take the minus sign solution from ( 4.16 ) we obtain @xmath250 ( we can eliminate the positive sign solution because , by ( 4.25 ) and similar triangles , we have @xmath251 ) if @xmath252 then @xmath253 in this case , taking the positive sign solution from ( 4.16 ) yields @xmath254    it is worth noting the character of the motion in various 2 dimensional projections other than the orbital plane .",
    "the pair @xmath255 moves around the circular cross section of the orbit cylinder : @xmath256 the motion of the pair @xmath257 is degenerate , being confined to the line l through the origin of slope @xmath258 while the pair ( z , y ) moves on an ellipse centered at the origin with axes of lengths @xmath259 and @xmath260    we conclude this section with a derivation of kepler s 3rd law .",
    "let @xmath261 be the period of the orbit .",
    "then , by ( 4.13 ) we have @xmath262 thus , by ( 4.20 ) and ( 4.21 ) , @xmath263 to eliminate @xmath123 , use kepler s 2nd law ( an easy consequence of conservation of momentum ) to find @xmath264 thus obtaining kepler s 3rd law : @xmath265",
    "the orbit cylinder axes , or equivalently , the asymptotes of the set of orbit cone vertices , may be regarded as elements of an orbit .",
    "it is therefore of interest to locate these axes for significant orbits such as the orbit of the earth .",
    "the orbit of the earth is not a fixed ellipse , so it is necessary to begin by clarifying what we mean by `` orbit of the earth . ''",
    "we shall regard the `` earth '' as an idealized point representing the center of mass of the earth - moon system .",
    "then , following the usual procedure for reducing a two body problem to a one body problem , we regard this point as being in orbit around the center of mass of the solar system , rather than the center of mass of the sun .",
    "the resulting orbit is still not an ellipse due to the influence of the other planets . nevertheless , during a reasonably short time interval  a year ,",
    "say  the orbit is an ellipse to very high precision .",
    "accordingly , we shall define the elliptical orbit of the earth as the best approximating ellipse during a selected year .",
    "it is natural to select for this role the year 2000 , since modern tables of stellar and planetary positions are referenced to the ecliptic and vernal equinox as they existed at 12 hours coordinated universal time on jan 1 , 2000 ( julian date 2451545.0 , or j2000 for short . )",
    "the jet propulsion laboratory web site @xcite provides the following values for selected elements of this orbit : semi - major axis @xmath266au , eccentricity @xmath267 inclination of orbital plane to reference plane @xmath268 and longitude of the perihelion @xmath269 ( recall that the longitude is measured eastward along the ecliptic from the j2000 vernal equinox . )",
    "the nonzero value of the inclination element deserves a comment .",
    "tabulated celestial coordinates reference the _ mean _ ecliptic and equator at the epoch j2000 , not the actual ecliptic and equator .",
    "the mean in question is an average over periodic perturbations ( e.g. , nutation of the earth s axis of rotation , ) which are more significant for the equator and equinox than for the ecliptic .",
    "since we are , in any case , considering an idealized orbit , we shall simply assume the orbit lies in the mean ecliptic and take @xmath270    the orbit cylinder axes intersect the celestial sphere at 4 points which may be regarded as lying infinitely far from the observer .",
    "thus , the geometric and apparent positions of these points coincide .",
    "( precise calculation of apparent positions of real celestial bodies  planets , moons , and even stars  must address the location of the observer , effects due to motion of the observer , and the finite speed of light . )",
    "we shall identify the axes by their points of intersection with the celestial sphere .    since the cylinder axes lie in a plane perpendicular to the ecliptic through the perihelion ,",
    "the circle of celestial longitude ( @xmath216 ) of all 4 points is the same as for the perihelion .",
    "the celestial latitude , @xmath271 , is the same as the angle we denoted @xmath239 in ( 4.26 ) above , and is determined by the eccentricity alone .",
    "the celestial coordinates of the 4 points are then as follows , where we list the pairs @xmath272 and in brackets the corresponding declination and right ascension : @xmath273$],@xmath274$],@xmath275$],and @xmath276 $ ] .",
