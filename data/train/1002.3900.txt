    "like the shannon entropy measures the uncertainty associated with a classical probability distribution , the von neuman entropy describes a quantum state via density operators [ 1 ] .",
    "it is a very useful measure of the purity of quantum states and contains all moments of the density operator .",
    "therefore , the entropy can be used as a measure of the entanglement degree of quantum states and has been extensively used to study the interaction between light field and atoms via jaynes - cummings model [ 2,3 ] . on the other hand , even though the entropy given an estimate of the entanglement degree , but it is not sufficient , such as the negativity or the concurrence .",
    "the problem of the last two is that they only apply to 2x2 or 2x3 systems , which is not our case .",
    "the entropy of the jaynes - cummings system has attracted much attention [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "the expression of the field entropy for the entangled states of a single two - level atom interacting with a single electromagnetic field mode in an ideal cavity with the atom undergoing either a one or a two - photon transition has been obtained in [ 9 ] . in addition , the evolution of the atomic or field entropy for a three - level atom interacting with one - mode [ 10,11 ] and two - mode [ 12 - 15 ] of cavity fields has also been examined .",
    "furthermore , recently obada and eied studied the entropy of a system composed of a @xmath0-type three - level atom interacting with a non - correlated two - mode cavity field in the presence of nonlinearities [ 16 ] .",
    "though all works mentioned above revealed a lot of interesting properties of the jaynes - cummings system , they limited to the situation of a single atom interacting with a cavity field .",
    "the study of the entropy of double - atom interacting via two - photon process with single or double cavity fields is missing to our knowledge . in a very recent work ,",
    "dsouza et al studied the entanglement swapping in the two - photon jaynes - cummings model [ 17 ] . preparing atoms 1 and 2 in an entangled state and two cavity fields 3 and 4 also in other entangled state , then sending atom 2 through cavity 3 during a proper interaction time , they implemented the entanglement swapping of the atomic and cavity systems",
    ". motivated by this result , in the present work , we will study the entropy of the field interacting with two three - level atoms during the entanglement swapping protocol .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give a brief introduction to our hamiltonian model and its solution in the next section .",
    "the key part , section 3 devotes to find analytical expression of the entropy of the atomic and cavity systems . some numerical simulations and discussions",
    "are given in section 4 .",
    "we finally present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this paper , we use the so - called ` full microscopic hamiltonian approach ' ( fmha ) [ 18,19 ] to describe a three - level atom in @xmath0 -configuration interacting with a single mode of a cavity - field via two - photon jaynes - cummings model . in the absence of a driven field upon the atom , the hamiltonian ( interaction picture ) that describes the atom - field interaction",
    "is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the one - photon coupling constant with respect to the transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is detuning parameter defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the cavity - field frequency and @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 are the frequencies associated with the atomic levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",

    "for example , from equation ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we have @xmath35 @xmath36 in the next section , we shall study the entropy of the system in this state .",
    "after the entanglement swapping , the density operator of the whole system is written in the form @xmath37 it is easy to see from eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) that both atomic and cavity field systems are in pure states at initial moment and independent of each other .",
    "therefore , the entropy of the whole system of field and atom is zero and remains constant . on the other hand , according to araki - lieb inequality [ 20 ] , the entropies of the atomic system and the cavity system satisfy @xmath38 since @xmath39 at any moment @xmath40 , entropy of the cavity system equals that of the atomic system .",
