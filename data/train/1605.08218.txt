    "the phase diagram of qcd has been investigated in the finite chemical potential @xmath0 and finite temperature @xmath1 region . recently ,",
    "the existence of the inhomogeneous chiral phase has been newly suggested and the property of this phase has been actively discussed by the analysis of the chiral effective models @xcite or the schwinger - dyson approach @xcite ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) . the observational possibility by the lattice qcd has been also suggested @xcite . in this phase ,",
    "quark condensate has a spatially modulating configuration and such a modulating condensate resembles the fflo - type superconductivity @xcite or spin / charge density wave @xcite . among some configurations of the inhomogeneous quark condensate",
    ", we here consider the dual chiral density wave ( dcdw ) @xcite , decided by the form , @xmath2 , within teh two - flavor qcd .",
    "the dcdw phase is favored compared to other configurations in the 1 + 1 dimensional system @xcite or the external magnetic field @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the dcdw phase may be realized in neutron stars because it is suggested to emerge in the moderate density region by the analysis of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . from the observation , the strong magnetic field ( @xmath4 g ) seems to exist in compact stars .",
    "the origin or mechanism of the maintenance of the strong magnetic field have not been fully understood yet though some mechanisms have been proposed from the macroscopic view point .",
    "it may be important and interesting to investigate the magnetic properties of quark matter to suggest the mechanism from the microscopic theory .",
    "we use the two - flavor njl model with the external magnetic field @xmath3 in the chiral limit . using the dcdw ansatz in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the dirac hamiltonian is obtained as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the electric charge matrix in flavor space . in the following , @xmath9",
    "is taken along the @xmath10 axis , @xmath11 . according to the ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy spectrum is constituted by the landau levels , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the spin polarization . if @xmath15 , @xmath16 corresponds to the positive ( negative ) energy state , that is , the ( anti-)particle state .",
    "however the sign of @xmath17 does not always imply that for the lowest landau level ( lll ) ( @xmath18 ) if @xmath19 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the spectrum of lll becomes asymmetric about the zero value , while the one of the higher landau levels ( hlls ) ( @xmath20 ) is always symmetric .      for the analysis of @xmath29 ,",
    "the chiral anomaly must be considered with caution @xcite . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , anomalous particle number is generally brought about by spectral asymmetry .",
    "accordingly anomalous contribution emerges in the thermodynamic potential . in the dcdw phase",
    ", it gives rise to anomalous particle number proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "then @xmath29 takes the form , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , which is the odd function about @xmath32 .",
    "the first term represents the contribution of anomaly derived from only lll while the second and third term are interpreted as the contributions of valence quarks coming from all the landau levels .",
    "note that @xmath29 does not * diverge * without any regularization .",
    "the anomalous contribution is caused by the spectral asymmetry and the @xmath33-invariant , @xmath34 , renders , @xmath35 spectral asymmetry can be evaluated with the proper regularization which does not violate the gauge invariance .",
    "note that in @xmath36 , this quantity reproduces the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term effectively derived from the chiral anomaly , argued in ref .",
    "although the wzw term does not depend on @xmath37 , the @xmath37 dependence emerges in our case when @xmath37 sufficiently becomes small .",
    "moreover it vanishes in the limit , @xmath38 , as should be .",
    "finally , @xmath39 does not include the contribution of anomaly and takes the form , @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is still included the uv divergence .",
    "the values of the order parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath32 , are determined for each @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath9 and make the thermodynamic potential minimum .",
    "they can be expanded about @xmath24 , @xmath43 the minimized thermodynamic potential is represented as , @xmath44 .",
    "magnetization is defined as the first derivative of the thermodynamic potential about the magnetic field . from the extremum conditions , @xmath45 , the spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath46 ) takes the form , @xmath47 from the eq.([ome1 ] )",
    ", @xmath29 has a finite value only when @xmath48 or @xmath49 does not vanish . in other words",
    ", @xmath46 does not vanish only in the dcdw phase .",
    "furthremore , it includes the contribution of not only anomaly but also valence quarks .",
    "the fig.[spo ] shows the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath46 at @xmath50mev . as temperature increases ,",
    "the range of @xmath41 gets narrow and the magnitude of @xmath46 decreases . assuming a sphere of quark matter with constant density ( @xmath51mev ) and uniform magnetization , the magnitude of the magnetic field made from @xmath46 is estimated , @xmath52 g , on the surface .",
    "c     ( a ) @xmath53     ( b ) @xmath54          magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath55 ) is defined as the first derivative of the magnetization about the magnetic field . from the stationary conditions",
    ", @xmath55 takes the form , @xmath56 which has the uv divergence coming from @xmath39",
    ". therefore it should be normalized to satisfy the condition , @xmath57 .",
    "thus the normalized @xmath55 is defined by subtracting the vacuum one , @xmath58 .",
    "fig.[sus ] shows the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath59 , which exhibits some singular behavior .",
    "the cusp behavior reflects the singularity of the thermodynamic potential on the point where valence quarks begin to appear .",
    "quark matter undergoes the first order phase transition at the critical point , where order parameters are discontinuous ( fig.[spo ] ) and @xmath59 is also discontinuous .",
    "however , @xmath59 does not indicate any singularity on the second order critical point ( fig.[spo ] ) while , in the ising model , magnetic susceptibility diverges on the second order critical point .",
    "therefore such behavior is unique in the case of the dcdw phase transition .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic properties of quark matter in the inhomogeneous chiral phase .",
    "spontaneous magnetization , which has both the contributions of anomaly and valence quarks , emerges there .",
    "the magnitude of magnetic field made from it may be estimated to be comparable with that in the observation of magnetars .",
    "magnetic susceptibility does not diverge on the second order phase transition point .",
    "the behavior is different from one in the familiar ferromagnetic system and unique in the inhomogeneous chiral phase transition .",
