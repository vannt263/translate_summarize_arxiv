    "subsequent experiments on ec decays of neutral atoms in solid environment have found no evidence for oscillations with periodicities of this order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "thus , the oscillations observed in the gsi experiment could have their origin in some characteristics of the h - like ions , produced and isolated in the esr , and in the electromagnetic fields specific to the esr which are not operative in normal laboratory experiments .",
    "indeed , it is suggested here that the ` gsi oscillations ' could be due to the static magnetic field , perpendicular to the esr , which stabilizes and navigates the motion of the ions in the esr .",

    "other authors @xcite have rejected any link between neutrino mass eigenstates and the ec decay rate oscillatory behavior reported by the gsi experiment @xcite , the underlying argument is that since no neutrino is singled out , the ec decay rate sums incoherently over amplitudes related to neutrino mass eigenstates , whereas any oscillatory behavior requires interference between such amplitudes . to be more specific , if the time - dependent ec transition amplitude @xmath25 , from initial state @xmath26 ( d injected at time @xmath27 ) to a final state @xmath28 ( r plus a coherent combination of neutrino mass eigenstates at time @xmath29 ) , is written in terms of transition amplitudes @xmath30 that involve mass - eigenstate neutrinos @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are mixing elements of the @xmath34 ( assumed unitary ) matrix @xmath35 @xmath36 between the emitted @xmath14 and mass - eigenstate neutrinos @xmath31 @xcite , then the associated probability is given by summing incoherently on @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the dependence of the absolute - squared terms @xmath39 on the species @xmath31 was neglected .",

    "notes that incoherence in terms of neutrino mass eigenstates rules out expressing the probability @xmath43 as a squared absolute value of the amplitude @xmath44 : @xmath45 it is instructive to ask whether incoherence shows up also in the flavor basis , since for times of order seconds which are appropriate to the ` gsi oscillations ' the coherence implied by eq .",

    "the main purpose of the present paper , however , is to introduce a new energy scale @xmath59 , essentially given by the product of the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath2 ( or rather its upper limit ) and the static magnetic field @xmath60 which is perpendicular to the esr .",

    "@xcite the heavy ions revolve in the esr with a period of order @xmath76  s and their motion is monitored nondestructively once per revolution .",
    "the decay is defined experimentally by the _ correlated _ disappearance of d and appearance of r , but the appearance in the frequency spectrum is delayed by times of order 1  s needed to cool r. the order of magnitude of the experimental time resolution is similar , about 0.5  s , as reflected in the time intervals used to exhibit the experimental decay rates @xmath77 in figs .",
