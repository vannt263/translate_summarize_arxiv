    "a spin foam model would ultimately describe the quantum geometry of space - time and any slice of it would be a spin network describing the space structure at a given time .",

    "indeed topological field theory of bf type can be exactly discretized with spin foam models .",
    "this is , in three dimensions , the result of the work of ponzano - regge @xcite and in 4 dimensions the work of ooguri @xcite .",
    "however without cosmological constant these models have infrared divergences .",
    "in the euclidean signature case these previous spin foam models can be regularized by the addition of a cosmological term and one obtains , in three dimensions , the turaev - viro model @xcite and in four dimensions the crane - yetter model @xcite .",
    "these spin foam models are built using representation theory of certain quantum groups .",
    "the barrett - crane model @xcite is a spin foam model which aim is to implement , in the ooguri model , the constraint of simplicity on @xmath3 .",
    "this can be done very easily in the euclidean case by restricting representations on the faces to be `` simple '' and by coloring the edges with a very peculiar intertwiner , known in the litterature as the barrett - crane intertwiner . soon after this proposal these authors gave a similar proposal @xcite in the lorentzian case .",
    "these models , which gave an impetus for a large amount of work on spin foam models of constrained @xmath0 theory , have several drawbacks :    \\1 ) the weight of the vertices is well defined ( a 10j symbol ) but the weights on the edges and faces are not fixed and are still a matter of debate @xcite .",

    "they differ only by the choice of the weight on the edges and on the faces .",
    "we will show that for any @xmath7- complex dual to a triangulation of the manifold , the integration over the coloring ( i.e area variables ) are finite for the quantum deformations of these three models .",
    "the third one is that , if the sum over 2-complexes can be defined , it is only in the presence of a cosmological constant .",

    "the lie algebra @xmath88 is also the real lie algebra of @xmath649 therefore we will use indifferently the notation @xmath5 or @xmath212 for its quantization .",
    "we define the quantum lorentz group @xmath5 as being the quantum double of @xmath57 .",
    "this construction is a standard and very important construction in the theory of quantum groups .",
    "it is exposed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the quantum double of @xmath57 is the hopf algebra @xmath650 .",
    "@xmath651 denotes the hopf algebra @xmath309 with permuted coproduct .",
    "the notation @xmath652 reminds the reader that inside @xmath653 , @xmath654 and @xmath655 do not commute but satisfy braided identities .",
    "in @xcite we have classified and given simple expressions for the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath89 we will only need the representation of the principal series which we denote @xmath405 where @xmath656 matrix elements of @xmath405 are linear forms on @xmath416 and therefore are elements of @xmath657    using the decomposition @xmath658 we have expressed in @xcite the matrix elements of @xmath405 in terms of a basis of @xmath659 we will use the following convenient basis which elements are @xmath660 .",
    "we will denote this basis by @xmath435 .",
    "the dual @xmath661 is @xmath416 ( more precisely contains @xmath662 as a hopf sub - algebra ) .",
    "one of its basis is the dual basis @xmath437 which is the basis @xmath663 with the duality bracket given by : @xmath664    we have given explicit formulas for the representation @xmath405 in this basis .",
    "namely : @xmath665 where @xmath666 are coefficients defined in terms of analytic continuation of @xmath42 symbols of @xmath57 and whose properties are studied in depth in @xcite . an explicit expression is given in equation ( 89 ) of @xcite .",
    "as a result we get the expression : @xmath667        the @xmath486 matrix of @xmath672 is given by the construction of the quantum double , its evaluation on principal representations has been computed in @xcite : @xmath673 in particular this expression implies that : @xmath674      in @xcite we have made a study of intertwining operators for the tensor product of principal representations .",
    "we have shown that if @xmath676 label principal representations , the space of intertwiners @xmath677 is one dimensional when @xmath678 and zero otherwise .",
    "we have chosen a particular normalized intertwiner , denoted @xmath679 , which satisfies the following completeness relation : @xmath680 with @xmath681 a normalization factor given by an infinite product expression and the integral @xmath682 means , as usual , an integral over @xmath683 and a sum over the integer @xmath684 .      note that when @xmath676 are simple the expression for @xmath52 reduces to a simple ratio of theta functions , as explained in @xcite and recalled in the appendix a.2 of the present work . as explained in the sequel ,",
    "this function @xmath52 is exactly the evaluation of the so - called `` theta '' graph @xmath688                      to express @xmath707 in term of theta functions , one can use the following trick which will be useful later on .",
    "we first expand @xmath708 , and we interchange the sum in @xmath707 by summing first over @xmath709 we therefore obtain that @xmath710          this enables us to show that @xmath555 is strictly positive and that we have the lower bound : @xmath717 to prove this lower bound we use the infinite product formula for @xmath568 and @xmath718 . as a result",
    "we obtain the inequalities , when @xmath150 is real , : @xmath719 as a result we obtain that @xmath720 where @xmath721"
