    "in the study of dynamical systems with complicated and possibly chaotic dynamics , average quantities are often of more interest than any particular solution trajectory .",
    "this is partly because of the difficulty of computing a trajectory precisely and partly because average quantities are more important in many applications .",
    "for instance , one might seek time - averaged drag forces in a model of an oil pipeline or ensemble - averaged temperatures in a stochastic climate model .",
    "one way to estimate averages quantitatively is to integrate the dynamical system numerically and average over the resulting particular solution .",
    "such direct numerical simulations are often straightforward , but the accuracy of the result is not guaranteed unless errors are rigorously controlled . moreover , even a perfectly accurate solution does not give information about the different trajectories that result from different initial conditions .",
    "finally , the computational cost of computing well - converged averages is often prohibitive , especially in systems that are high - dimensional or stochastic .",
    "a complementary approach , which we pursue here , is to prove bounds on average quantities directly from the governing equations .",
    "an advantage over numerical integration is that bounds can be proven without knowing any solution trajectories .",
    "furthermore , they can be proven for all possible trajectories at once , or for all trajectories within a given region of state space . on the other hand , it is generally difficult to prove bounds that are tight enough to give good estimates of the average quantities being bounded .    the aim of this work is to develop methods for proving bounds that are tight , meaning that the upper and lower bounds are equal or nearly so .",
    "we assume that the quantity of interest can be described by a function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the state vector of a dynamical system , and we seek to bound averages of @xmath2 . in deterministic systems , we consider averages over infinite time , @xmath3   \\,dt.\\ ] ] if the above limit does not exist it can be replaced by limit superior or inferior for the upper and lower bound problems , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends in general on which trajectory @xmath5 is being averaged over . in stochastic systems with a stationary probability distribution @xmath6",
    ", we consider stationary ensemble averages , @xmath7    one obstacle to proving tight bounds is , for reasons described shortly , the need to determine whether certain complicated expressions are sign - definite . as proposed in  @xcite ,",
    "this can be done systematically with computer assistance for finite - dimensional systems with polynomial dynamics .",
    "the main idea , described further in  [ ss : sosboundsreview ] , is to construct a polynomial whose non - negativity implies the desired bound . by the methods of sum - of - squares ( sos ) programming  @xcite , a sufficient condition for this non - negativity can then be posed as a semidefinite program ( sdp ) .    in deterministic systems",
    "there is a second obstacle to proving tight bounds .",
    "it is generally easiest to construct bounds that hold for all possible initial conditions",
    ". sometimes this is desired , but other times one is interested in a particular local attractor , and bounds holding globally are not generally tight for averages over a local attractor . in this sense , the local bound is spoiled by any other invariant structure in the state space , such as another attractor or an unstable fixed point .",
    "we pursue two ways of obtaining tight bounds specific to a local attractor .",
    "the first is to enforce conditions that imply the bound only on an absorbing set around the attractor , thereby omitting other invariant structures .",
    "the second is to add noise to the system and prove bounds for ensemble averages in the vanishing noise limit .",
    "if the system is stochastically stable , then under certain conditions this limit will agree with the corresponding deterministic time average  @xcite .",
    "note that these ideas are applicable irrespectively of any special structure in the system ( such as hamiltonian ) , and can in principle be applied to systems of arbitrarily high but finite dimension .    throughout this work",
    ", we illustrate the methods described using the van der pol oscillator  @xcite , which can be written as @xmath8 where a dot denotes @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 sets the strength of the nonlinear damping .",
    "there is a limit cycle that attracts all trajectories except the unstable fixed point at the origin ( figure  [ f : vdpphaseportrait ] ) , and the global invariant set is composed of the limit cycle and the fixed point .",
    "the system is a standard example of a nonlinear oscillator and has been studied extensively , including with stochastic forcing  @xcite .",
    "here we find nearly tight bounds on averages of @xmath11 both with and without noise .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ ss : sosboundsreview ] reviews the framework of  @xcite for bounding deterministic averages and uses it to find upper bounds on @xmath12 in the van der pol system .",
    "section [ ss : localbounds ] extends the framework to give attractor - specific bounds , which we use to find lower bounds on @xmath12 over the van der pol limit cycle .",
    "these lower bounds are larger than zero and thus do not apply to the unstable fixed point .",
    "the bounding methods for stochastic dynamical systems are described in  [ ss : generalnoiseformulation ] , and they are specialized to the case of small and vanishing noise in   [ ss : smallnoise][ss : vanishingnoise ] .",
    "the methods of these sections give bounds on @xmath13 in the van der pol example for a range of noise amplitudes .",
    "section [ s : furthercomments ] discusses the limitations of our methods and gives ideas for improvement , and   [ s : conclusion ] offers concluding remarks .",
    "consider an autonomous dynamical system @xmath14 in which all trajectories @xmath5 remain bounded as @xmath15 .",
    "we assume nothing special about the structure of @xmath16 except that the system is bounded , although eventually we restrict attention to polynomial @xmath16 .",
    "we wish to prove upper and lower bounds on @xmath4 , the average of a function @xmath0 over a trajectory @xmath5 . in applications ,",
    "@xmath2 can be chosen as a quantity of interest for the system .",
    "unless the system has a single attractor that is globally asymptotically stable , different trajectories can give different values of @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we seek global bounds on @xmath4 , meaning they hold for every possible value of @xmath4 .",
    "suppose we wish to prove a constant lower bound @xmath17 on all possible @xmath4 , @xmath18 central to our method will be a suitably chosen differentiable _ storage function _ @xmath19 .",
    "no matter what @xmath20 is chosen , @xmath21 along any bounded trajectory because @xmath22-v\\left[{{\\mathbf{x}}}(0)\\right]\\right )   = 0.\\ ] ] the desired bound   is thus equivalent to the inequality@xmath23 for any differentiable @xmath19 .",
    "the above time average can not be evaluated without knowing trajectories @xmath5 , but a sufficient condition for the inequality to hold is for it to hold pointwise for all @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we will have proven that @xmath25 if we can find any differentiable @xmath19 such that @xmath26 an upper bound @xmath27 can be proven in a similar way by reversing the inequality sign in the pointwise sufficient condition .",

    "there are two difficulties in applying the above proposition to yield good bounds @xmath33 and @xmath17 .",
    "the first is choosing the storage functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the second is checking whether @xmath39 and @xmath40 for candidate storage functions and bound values .",
    "these difficulties can be prohibitive in general , but the task is greatly simplified when @xmath16 and @xmath2 are polynomials of the state variables @xmath41 . in the rest of this work",
    "we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath2 are polynomials .",
    "if the chosen @xmath37 and @xmath38 are also polynomials , then so are @xmath42 and @xmath43 . checking the sufficient conditions   and   thus amounts to verifying the non - negativity of polynomial expressions .",
    "while this is an np - hard problem , the computational complexity can be significantly reduced by replacing the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the stronger conditions that @xmath43 and @xmath46 belong to the set @xmath47 of polynomials that are sums - of - squares ( sos ) .",

    "new methods will be needed to maintain tight bounds as noise becomes weak in systems with other unstable structures , including saddle points .",
    "lastly , the methods of  [ ss : localbounds ] can be used to bound averages on trajectories within an absorbing domain and , in particular , on a single attractor .",

    "as explained in  [ ss : computerassistedproof ] , techniques are available to control the roundoff errors in the solution of the sdps and compute rigorous bounds",

    "<S> we describe methods for proving upper and lower bounds on infinite - time averages in deterministic dynamical systems and on stationary expectations in stochastic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics and the quantities to be bounded are assumed to be polynomial functions of the state variables . </S>",
    "<S> the methods are computer - assisted , using sum - of - squares polynomials to formulate sufficient conditions that can be checked by semidefinite programming . in the deterministic case , we seek tight bounds that apply to particular local attractors . an obstacle to proving such bounds is that they do not hold globally ; they are generally violated by trajectories starting outside the local basin of attraction . </S>",
    "<S> we describe two closely related ways past this obstacle : one that requires knowing a subset of the basin of attraction , and another that considers the zero - noise limit of the corresponding stochastic system . </S>",
    "<S> the bounding methods are illustrated using the van der pol oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> we bound deterministic averages on the attracting limit cycle above and below to within 1% , which requires a lower bound that does not hold for the unstable fixed point at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain similarly tight upper and lower bounds on stochastic expectations for a range of noise amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> . limitations of our methods for certain types of deterministic systems are discussed , along with prospects for improvement . </S>"
