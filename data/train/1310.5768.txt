    "the pole structure of the @xmath2 resonance is a key issue to understand the nature of @xmath2 and the @xmath4 interaction . because @xmath2 decays exclusively into the @xmath5 channel with @xmath6 by the strong interaction , a signal associated with @xmath2",
    "is expected to be observed in the @xmath0 invariant mass distributions ( to be referred to as `` line - shape '' ) of certain @xmath2 production reactions .    in old bubble chamber experiments , bumps associated with the @xmath2 excitation",
    "have been observed in the @xmath0 line - shapes of hadron induced reactions , such as @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the observed bumps in the first two experiments are consistent with the @xmath2 resonance at 1405 mev , while the reaction with a deuteron target found the @xmath2 resonance at 1420 mev .",
    "recently , the @xmath10 line - shape for the @xmath2 energies was also measured in hadronic reactions , such as @xmath11 with 514 - 750 mev / c kaon momenta by crystal ball collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath12 with 3.65 gev / c proton beam at cosy - jlich  @xcite .",
    "although there have been several data for the @xmath2 spectrum from the hadron beam experiments as mentioned above , the quality of the data is still not sufficient for extracting @xmath2 pole(s ) .",
    "the situation has been changed by recent photon - beam experiments .",
    "the first photoproduction of the @xmath2 resonance was observed at spring 8 by leps collaboration in the @xmath1 reaction with the photon energy of 1.5 - 2.4 gev  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 line - shapes were measured , and they were found to be different from each other , owing to the interference between the @xmath6 resonant and @xmath15 non - resonant contributions .",
    "a high statistics , wide angle coverage experiment for the @xmath1 reaction was performed at jefferson laboratory by the clas collaboration , for center - of - mass energies @xmath16 gev  @xcite . in this experiment , all the three charge states of the @xmath5 channels were simultaneously observed in the @xmath17 scattering for the first time , and the differential cross sections were measured for the @xmath0 line - shape and for the @xmath3 angular distribution .",
    "this is the cleanest data that cover the kinematics of @xmath2 excitation , which encourages theorists to seriously work on extracting the @xmath2 pole(s ) from data for the first time . very recently",
    "the spectral shape of @xmath2 has been also observed in electroproduction in the range of @xmath18 @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the coupled - channel approach based on the chiral effective theory ( chiral unitary model ) suggests that the @xmath2 resonance is composed of two poles located between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 thresholds  @xcite and these states have different masses , widths and couplings to the @xmath4 and @xmath0 channels .",
    "one pole is located at @xmath20 mev with a dominant coupling to @xmath4 , while the other is sitting at @xmath21 mev with a strong coupling to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these two states are generated dynamically by the attractive interaction in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 channels with @xmath6  @xcite . because the @xmath2 resonance is composed of two states which have different weight to couple with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the spectral shape of the @xmath0 line - shape in the @xmath2 region depends on how @xmath2 is produced , as pointed out in ref .",
    "reference  @xcite predicts that the @xmath2 resonance in the @xmath22 channel has a peak at 1420 mev with a narrower width because the higher pole strongly couples to the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that , in the @xmath23 reaction , @xmath2 is dominantly produced by @xmath4 , and the @xmath0 line - shape has a peak at 1420 mev as seen in the old bubble chamber experiment  @xcite .",
    "it is important to confirm the two - pole structure by analyzing the new clas data , and if so , it will be interesting to see how the two - pole structure plays a role in the @xmath0 line - shape . in order to extract the @xmath2 resonance pole(s ) from the production data ,",
    "we develop a model that consists of production mechanism followed by the final state interaction ( fsi ) ; @xmath2 is excited in the fsi . through a careful analysis of the data , we can pin down the production mechanism as well as the scattering amplitude responsible for the fsi . then the @xmath2 pole(s ) will be extracted from the scattering amplitude .",
    "such an analysis of the new clas data has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite using a simple production mechanism .",
    "in this work , we focus on the photoproduction of @xmath2 in @xmath1 , and investigate the new clas data for the @xmath0 line - shape  @xcite .",
    "the first study of the reaction was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a simple diagram was considered for the @xmath2 production mechanism and the @xmath2 is described by the chiral unitary approach .",
    "related calculations were also done in refs .  @xcite .",
    "although the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite was to get a rough estimate of the cross sections , in the advent of the fairly precise data , it is necessary to develop a quantitative model to extract the @xmath2 properties from the data . in this work ,",
    "we extend and refine the model of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering more production mechanisms that are gauge invariant at the tree - level .",
    "we consider relevant meson - exchange mechanisms , and contact terms that simulate short - range mechanisms .",
    "we explain details of the model , and successfully fit the clas data with it .",
    "then we discuss a role played by each mechanism , effects of non - resonant contributions , and a possibility of a single - pole solution of @xmath2 . by doing so",
    ", we set a starting point for a full analysis in which we simultaneously analyze the data for line - shape  @xcite and the @xmath3 angular distribution  @xcite to study the pole structure of @xmath2 .",
    "such a full analysis is left to a future work .",
    "we expect the @xmath3 angular distribution data are an important information to pin down the production mechanism .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we give a detailed description of our model in sec .  [",

    "then we show numerical results and discuss them in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , followed by a summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "expressions for lagrangians and photo - production operators , and also model parameters are collected in appendices .",
    "first we define kinematical variables .",
    "we consider the @xmath24 reaction in which the variables in the parentheses are four - momenta for the particles in the total center - of - mass system .",
    "the differential cross section for the reaction is derived following a standard procedure , and given as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the masses of the proton , @xmath30 , @xmath3 and @xmath31 , respectively , and the kllen function is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the symbol @xmath33 is the squared total energy of the system , and is related to the four - momenta by @xmath34 , while the invariant mass of the @xmath0 subsystem is @xmath35 .",
    "the kinematical variables with asterisk stand for the quantities in the @xmath0 center - of - mass system .",
    "the summation of spin and polarization states in initial and final particles are indicated by @xmath36 ; the average factor , 1/4 , for the initial states is already included in the factor of the formula .",
    "all information about the dynamics is encoded into the reaction amplitude @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) , and is discussed in detail in the next subsection . the line - shape of the @xmath0 spectrum is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) over the angular part of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and given as @xmath40      as stated in the introduction , we describe the @xmath41 reaction by a set of tree - level mechanisms for @xmath42 ( @xmath43 : a set of meson and baryon ) followed by @xmath44 rescattering .",
    "we use an index @xmath45 to specify @xmath46 , @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "thus the reaction amplitude introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) , @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a tree - level photo - production mechanism .",
    "in the next paragraph , we specify the tree mechanisms that go into our calculation .",
    "the summation of @xmath51 runs over all of the tree - level photoproduction mechanisms included in our calculation .",
    "contribution from the rescattering is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "the rescattering amplitude is calculated with a partial wave expansion with respect to the relative motion of @xmath43 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 partial waves are considered ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the total and orbital angular momenta for @xmath43 .",
    "the partial wave amplitude is given , with the on - shell factorization , by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are partial wave amplitudes of @xmath52 and @xmath50 , respectively , and are calculated with the on - shell momenta of relevant particles .",
    "more details about the partial wave expansion , including the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath52 , are given in appendix  [ app : pw ] .",
    "for the @xmath60 scattering amplitudes @xmath61 , we use those from the chiral unitary model given in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath53 wave , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath62 wave .",
    "the @xmath53 wave contains @xmath2 as double poles , while the @xmath62 wave does not include any resonance and provide a smooth background .",
    "it is turned out that the contribution from the @xmath62 wave rescattering is small .",
    "we use the meson - baryon green function , @xmath63 , calculated with the dimensional regularization as follows : @xmath64 \\bigg\\ } \\ , \\label{eq : gpropdr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the masses of a baryon @xmath67 and a meson @xmath68 , respectively , and we use the values listed in the particle data group  @xcite for the masses . the relative on - shell momentum of @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath33",
    "is denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "the symbol @xmath70 is the subtraction constant for the regularization scale @xmath71 , and we set @xmath72  mev for all channels .",
    "the subtraction constants can depend on a channel @xmath73 as well as a production mechanism @xmath51 ; we will come back to this point at the end of this section .",
    "we consider gauge - invariant tree - level photo - production mechanisms ( @xmath50 ) as follows : minimal substitution to the lowest order chiral meson - baryon interaction such as the weinberg - tomozawa terms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wt ] ) and the born terms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : br1 ] ) ; vector - meson exchange mechanisms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vec ] ) .",
    "thus , for specifying each mechanism @xmath51 , we use the label for each figure in figs .",
    "[ fig : wt]-[fig : vec ] so that @xmath76[fig : wt](a ) , [ fig : wt](b ) , .. , [ fig : vec](k ) .",
    "these photo - production mechanisms are expanded in terms of @xmath77 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 terms are considered in our calculation .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath50 , as well as our model lagrangians from which @xmath50 are derived , are shown in appendix  [ app : lag ] and [ app : ph - amp ] .",
    "coupling constants contained in @xmath50 of figs .",
    "[ fig : wt]-[fig : vec ] are fixed either by data ( other than @xmath80 ) if possible , or by su(3 ) relation if poorly constrained by data .",
    "more details about the couplings are given in appendix  [ app : lag ] .",
    "with the meson - exchange production mechanisms and the subtraction constants ( @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) ) taken as the same as those in the chiral unitary amplitudes , we can not reproduce the @xmath0 line - shape data for the @xmath80 reaction from the clas  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is inevitable to introduce adjustable degrees of freedom to fit the data . thus all of the meson - exchange mechanisms @xmath50 are multiplied by a common form factor of the following form : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are respectively the momenta of @xmath3 and @xmath84 in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath43 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath85 will be used to fit the data . in addition",
    ", we also consider phenomenological contact terms that can simulate mechanisms not explicitly considered , such as , in particular , @xmath86 and @xmath87 excitation mechanisms .",
    "we take couplings for the contact terms @xmath88-dependent ( @xmath88 : total energy of the system ) , and will be determined by fitting the @xmath80 data  @xcite .",
    "we consider three types of contact terms that are gauge - invariant at the tree - level , and are couple to @xmath89 and @xmath90 states of different charges , and thus we have 15 complex couplings at each @xmath88 .",
    "expressions for the contact terms are presented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1])-([eq : c3 ] ) in appendix . also , for the mechanism index @xmath51 , we write @xmath91 , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1])-([eq : c3 ] ) .",
    "the form factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff ] ) is not applied to the contact terms .",
    "the subtraction constants @xmath70 included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) are also adjusted to fit the data , thereby changing the interference pattern between different production mechanisms .",
    "as already stated , @xmath70 can depend on the production mechanism @xmath76[fig : wt](a ) , [ fig : wt](b ) , .. , [ fig : vec](k ) , @xmath92 .",
    "however , some of @xmath51 s should have the same value for @xmath70 .",
    "also , we do not want to have too many free parameters from the subtraction constants , because it will complicate fitting the data .",
    "thus we classify the production mechanisms into several groups , and each group has its own real subtraction constant . in grouping , we try to classify important mechanisms into different groups so that we have effective freedom in fitting . in table",
