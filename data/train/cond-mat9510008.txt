    "recent progress in microlithography @xcite has made it possible to fabricate artificial semiconductor structures containing only a few electrons , called quantum dots .",
    "electrons can be added to a quantum dot one by one , and its properties can be investigated by various techniques , e.g. , tunneling @xcite , capacitance measurements @xcite , and optical spectroscopy @xcite . in particular , the chemical potential @xmath0 of the @xmath1 electron system can be measured as a function of various parameters , e.g. the confining potential or the external magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the chemical potential is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ground state energy of the @xmath1 electron system , and consequently contains information about the ground state energy of interacting electrons .",
    "as some parameter ( say @xmath2 ) is changed , the ground states of the @xmath1 and @xmath5 electrons vary continuously until a level crossing occurs , at which time @xmath0 exhibits a cusp @xcite ; such cusps are observed in various experiments @xcite .",
    "a completely non - interacting electron model is not sufficient for describing the quantum dot physics , and the repulsive coulomb interaction must be taken into account at some level . in the simplest scenario , the energy to add an extra electron can be modeled in terms of a classical capacitance , which is a smooth function of the number of electrons in the dot @xcite . superimposed over this smooth classical contribution",
    "are small fluctuations , that originate from either the quantization of single - particle energy levels in the quantum dot , or correlations due to the coulomb interaction , or a combination of the two . in the zeroth order approximation ,",
    "the corrections to the classical energy may be computed in terms of non - interacting electrons in the quantum dot @xcite .",
    "then , whenever there is a level crossing in the non - interacting ground state , a cusp appears in @xmath0 . at high @xmath2 ,",
    "a level crossing occurs when an electron changes its landau level ( ll ) index , or reverses its spin within the same ll .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated in detail the region where both spin species of only the lowest ll are occupied , and found that a hartree - fock theory @xcite provides a reasonably accurate quantitative account of the cusp positions ; the cusps in this case originate when the electrons flip their spin one by one , until they are fully polarized .    at",
    "still higher @xmath2 , when the filling factor @xmath6 , and all electrons are fully polarized , an interplay of different ll s is not possible .",
    "a non - interacting electron model or a hartree - fock - type calculation will obtain the ground state energy to be a smooth function of various parameters , and as a result will not produce any level crossings .",
    "however , detailed exact diagonalization studies on small systems show that level crossings do indeed occur in this regime @xcite .",
    "these originate exclusively from coulomb correlations .",
    "phase diagrams @xcite for the ground state as a function of the magnetic field and the strength of the confinement have been constructed using exact diagonalization studies .",
    "such studies , however , are possible only for quantum dots with very few electrons .    the results of exact diagonalization studies of fully polarized electronic states have been interpreted in terms of the composite fermion theory @xcite .",
    "the motivation comes from the relevance of composite fermions to the phenomenon of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite that occurs when two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) are exposed to very high magnetic fields . in this framework",
    ", the fqhe can be understood as the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of composite fermions @xcite .",
    "the fqhe occurs as a result of incompressibility , i.e. , cusps in the ground state energy as a function of the magnetic field , which suggests that the physics of the cusps in quantum dots is related to the physics of the fqhe .",
    "it was shown that the cusps in the quantum dot states can be understood in terms of non - interacting composite fermions @xcite .",
    "their origin is briefly as follows .",
    "the electron system completely confined to the lowest ll maps on to composite fermions with several _",
    "quasi-_ll s occupied , and the interaction energy of electron is mapped into an effective cyclotron energy of the composite fermions .",
    "level crossings in @xmath4 then occur as a result of an interplay between various quasi - ll s of composite fermions , i.e. , as the composite fermions change their quasi - ll index one by one .",
    "thus , the cf theory effectively provides a single particle description for the correlation effects , and gives a very simple intuitive picture for understanding the principal features of the strongly correlated quantum dot ground states .",
    "the study of refs .",
    "@xcite extended the applicability of the cf model to systems with non - uniform densities , and edges .",
    "( most earlier studies used the spherical geometry which has no edges . ) also , since the composite fermions are many - body objects , one may ask how many electrons are needed before the cf description becomes valid .",
    "( of course , there is no composite fermion for a single electron . ) in the case of fully polarized electrons , the cf description was found to be reasonably good even for as few as three electrons @xcite .",
    "this work investigates the applicability of the cf theory to quantum dots in the limit of vanishing zeeman energy .",
    "this limit is relevant ( in certain parameter range ) because the zeeman splitting is rather small in gaas , roughly 1/60 of the cyclotron energy , since the band g - factor ( @xmath7 ) of electrons and their band mass ( @xmath8 ) are both very small .",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies in fqhe have shown that even for moderately strong magnetic fields , the ground - states are not always fully spin - polarized ( e.g. , @xmath9 , etc .",
    "have spin - singlet ground - states ) .",
    "similar physics can be expected in quantum dots .",
    "certain features in single - electron capacitance spectroscopy @xcite and tunneling @xcite experiments in quantum dots have been interpreted in terms of spin singlet states , and the effect of the spin degree of freedom has been investigated in several theoretical studies @xcite",
    ".    in nonfully - polarized states electrons may overlap spatially and hence one would expect the residual interaction between composite fermions to be of greater importance than for fully polarized composite fermions @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the non - interacting cf model still identifies the relatively strong cusps .",
    "the additional weaker cusps are a signature of a residual interaction between composite fermions .",
    "while the true residual interaction between the composite fermions is not known , even a minimal `` delta - function '' hard - core interaction gives reasonable qualitative picture for the weaker structure .",
    "the low - zeeman - energy quasi - ll gap is found to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of the fully polarized composite fermions .",
    "for example , in units of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective magnetic length , the quasi - ll gap in the large zeeman energy limit @xcite was @xmath12 , whereas in the small zeeman energy limit the gap is @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the cf description improves as the number of electrons confined in the dot increases .",
    "our main objective here is to investigate the validity of the cf model , for which we will compare its consequences with the results of exact diagonalization studies .",
    "therefore , we restrict our study to small systems . it should however be emphasized that the details of the cf model may be worked out rather straightforwardly even for a large number of electrons .",
    "the non - interacting cf model should therefore prove useful in analyzing experimental results in the high field regime where the hartree - fock approximation is not applicable , and exact diagonalization can not be performed .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii gives the results of exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "section iii compares the cf theory with numerical studies at zero zeeman energy . in section iv",
    ", we consider the electron - ground - state phase diagrams as a function of the confinement strength and magnetic field , and also some typical addition spectra .",
    "we will consider two - dimensional quantum dots with parabolic confinement @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "further , we will assume sufficiently high @xmath2 that the cyclotron energy @xmath15 is large compared to the confinement energy @xmath16 , but the zeeman energy remains sufficiently small ( which will be set to zero throughout this work ) .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath17 commutes with the coulomb interaction , which makes it possible to diagonalize the problem in various @xmath17 subspaces separately . for zero zeeman energy ,",
    "the total spin @xmath18 is also a good quantum number , so it is sufficient to work in the subspace of the lowest @xmath19 , provided it is remembered that each state in this subspace represents a multiplet of @xmath20 degenerate states of the full hilbert space . in the high @xmath2 limit , the ground state energy @xmath21 in a given @xmath17 subspace nicely separates into two parts , the confinement energy @xmath22 and the interaction energy @xmath23 .",
    "the former is given by @xmath24l\\;\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath23 is the same as the interaction energy of the ground state at @xmath17 _ without _ any confinement , provided the magnetic length is replaced by an effective magnetic length @xmath11 , given by @xmath25 . as a result , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath23 for a system without any confinement .",
    "the true ground state of the system is determined by the minimum of @xmath26 . while it will depend on various parameters , like @xmath2 or @xmath27 ,",
    "it is in general a state where the plot of @xmath21 vs @xmath17 has a downward cusp ; states with upward cusps will never become ground states .",
    "it is convenient to define the size of a cusp at @xmath17 as @xmath28 .",
    "then , only states with positive @xmath29 may become ground states with suitable choice of parameters .",
    "since @xmath30 is a linear function of @xmath17 , @xmath31 , and the possible ground states can be identified directly from the plot of @xmath23 .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian was diagonalized exactly for hilbert spaces of sizes less than 3500 , using standard numerical subroutines . for bigger hilbert spaces",
    ", we used a modified lanczos technique @xcite to obtain a few of the low energy states .",
    "the maximum size we have studied is approximately 45000 .",
    "the lanczos scheme requires care in dealing with states that are almost degenerate .",
    "exact diagonalization has been carried out in a number of earlier studies , to which the reader is referred for details yang , chaplik , hawrylak , palacios , daniela1,lai , girvin , johnson , stone , laughlin , tapash .",
    "( 1 ) shows @xmath23 as a function of @xmath17 for 3 - 6 electrons .",
    "the structure on the curves is small compared to that seen in the analogous plot for spin - polarized electrons @xcite . in order to bring out the cusps more clearly , we plot in figs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) @xmath32 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "as stated earlier , @xmath29 is positive for downward cusps and negative for upward cusps .",
    "composite fermions are relevant when two - dimensional electrons are subjected to a strong magnetic field",
    ". the essential role of the coulomb interaction is presumed to bind an even number of vortices of the many - particle wavefunction to each electron .",
    "the resultant electron + vortex combination has the statistics of a fermion and is called a composite fermion : @xmath33 microscopically , the formation of composite fermions implies that the ( unnormalized ) low - energy wave functions of interacting electrons with total angular momentum @xmath17 have the form : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wave function of electrons with total angular momentum @xmath38 , and @xmath39 projects the wave function on to the lll of electrons , as appropriate for @xmath40 .",
    "the jastrow factor @xmath41 binds @xmath42 vortices to each electron of @xmath37 to convert it into a composite fermion .",
    "non - interacting composite fermions are obtained when @xmath37 is taken to be the wave function of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the ll s of non - interacting electrons of @xmath37 map into quasi - ll s of composite fermions , separated by a quasi - cyclotron energy gap , which is treated as a parameter of the theory .",
    "the system of interacting electrons at arbitrary @xmath17 is mapped into a system of composite fermions in the range @xmath43 with a suitable choice of @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the angular momentum of the @xmath46 state of fully polarized electrons .",
    "note that the above discussion is applicable in both the large and the small zeeman energy limits . in the former ,",
    "the electrons in @xmath37 are assumed to be fully polarized , whereas in the latter , which is the case in the present study , electrons in @xmath37 can have either spin , with the zeeman energy set to zero .      according to the cf theory , the interacting electron system at @xmath17 is equivalent to a weakly interacting cf system at @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "( 6 ) we also plot the kinetic energy of composite fermions as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "this is the same as that of non - interacting electrons at @xmath38 , but with the cyclotron energy of electrons replaced by an effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions , denoted by @xmath48 , which is to be determined emperically by comparison with the interaction energy curve .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider in some detail why cusps appear in fig .",
    "consider @xmath49 .",
    "for non - interacting electrons , there are no cusps for @xmath50 ; at @xmath51 the occupied single particle states in the lowest ll are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the single particle state with angular momentum @xmath57 and spin down .",
    "the exact diagonalization calculation for interacting electrons however shows cusps .",
    "let us go to the non - interacting cf basis .",
    "the total angular momentum of composite fermions is @xmath58 .",
    "all composite fermions can be accommodated in the lowest quasi - ll for @xmath59 , which corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath38 is reduced , one composite fermion must be pushed into the second quasi - ll .",
    "the lowest @xmath38 with only one composite fermion in the second quasi - ll is @xmath61 , where the ground state contains three composite fermions in the lowest quasi - ll , in angular momentum states 0,0 , and 1 , and one in the second quasi - ll , in the angular momentum state -1 @xcite . for decreasing @xmath38 further",
    ", the cf - kinetic energy must be raised further .",
    "this would result in a cusp in the interacting electron system at @xmath62 .",
    "similar analysis produces the curves of fig .",
    "the cusp sizes are plotted in figs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) .",
    "the prominent cusps in the interaction energy curve are well reproduced by the non - interacting - cf theory . the effective cyclotron energy , in units of @xmath63 ,",
    "is determined to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting that the description of interacting electrons in terms of composite fermions becomes better for larger @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the negative cf cusps for @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to negative cusps in the interacting energy spectrum , but to positive cusps for @xmath68 and 4 ( even though the overall shape is obtained correctly ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since composite fermions are inherently many - body objects , and may not be appropriate for systems with very few electrons . for zero zeeman energy ,",
    "the composite fermion description is only qualitatively valid for quantum dots with fewer than five electrons .",
    "there are additional cusps in the @xmath23 curve , of relatively small sizes , that can not be explained within the non - interacting cf model .",
    "in particular , this model predicts an absence of cusps in the region corresponding to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the smallest angular momentum possible within the lowest ll , but there are several cusps in @xmath23 in the corresponding region @xmath71 .",
    "the additional cusps can be interpreted as originating from a residual interaction between the composite fermions .",
    "these cusps are roughly an order of magnitude weaker than the primary cusps , showing that the residual interaction between the composite fermions is weak compared to their effective cyclotron energy",
    ".    the residual interaction between the composite fermions may be incorporated by taking the composite fermions at @xmath38 to be interacting .",
    "we have considered two models in an attempt to mimic the residual interaction , one in which the composite fermions at @xmath38 interact via the coulomb interaction , and the other in which they interact via a hard - core interaction . for simplicity , we have considered only the range @xmath72 , where all composite fermions are in the lowest quasi - ll .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) show the coulomb interaction energy cusp - size ( panel a , broken lines ) .",
    "it is clear that it captures the qualitative physics of the weaker cusps .",
    "the same is true of a hard - core delta function interaction .",
    "this suggests that the dominant part of the residual interaction is the contact interaction , explaining why the residual interaction is less important for fully polarized electrons .      besides the shape of the @xmath23 curve , the cf scheme also sheds light on the low - energy spectrum of states of interacting electrons .",
    "( 7a ) shows the low - energy spectrum of a five electron system in the range @xmath73 .",
    "the spin quantum number is shown on the figure for a few of the low - energy states .",
    "( 7b ) shows the spectrum of composite fermions in the range @xmath74 , interacting via the coulomb interaction . the low - energy spectrum of fig .",
    "( 7b ) matches nicely that of fig .",
    "( 7a ) . at several values of @xmath17 , there are two nearly degenerate ground states in fig .",
    "this is also seen in fig .",
    "( 7b ) , although the ordering of the two states is sometimes reversed .",
    "note that it is crucial to consider _ interacting _ composite fermions in order to explain the low - energy spectrum - for non - interacting composite fermions , all states at a given @xmath38 in fig .",
    "7(b ) would be degenerate .",
    "the ground state at @xmath75 is fully spin - polarized , known to be well described by the laughlin wave function @xcite .",
    "we find that there is another state very close to it in energy .",
    "we do not fully understand the origin of this state at the moment .",
    "it is believed that the laughlin state is non - degenerate in the thermodynamic limit even for zero zeeman energy , except for the spin multiplicity . in our calculations , we find that the energy difference between the two states increases with @xmath1 ( it is 0.0027 , 0.0046 and 0.0047 , in units of @xmath10 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ) , suggesting that the other state may not be relevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also note here parenthetically that the ground state quantum numbers in our calculations are sometimes in disagreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ground states of interacting electrons are  compact \" states of composite fermions . in order to define compact states , and their relationship to ground states ,",
    "let us first consider the system of non - interacting fermions in the range @xmath78 .",
    "let us fix the number of electrons in the @xmath79 ll to be @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "then , the state with the smallest total angular momentum is called compact , denoted by @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath83 is the index of the highest occupied ll .",
    "this state has the property that the @xmath80 electrons in the @xmath84th ll occupy the innermost angular momentum states ( hence the name compact ) .",
    "it is clear that all of the positive cusp states of non - interacting fermions are compact , since otherwise the total angular momentum can always be decreased without increasing the kinetic energy .",
    "( of course , every compact state is not necessarily associated with a positive cusp . )",
    "we have already shown that the principal cusps of interacting electrons can be explained in terms of non - interacting composite fermions .",
    "these states are therefore compact states of composite fermions .",
    "their wave functions , denoted by @xmath85_{cf}$ ] , are obtained according to eq .",
    "( [ cfwf ] ) , i.e. , by multiplying the wave functions of compact electron states by the jastrow factor , and then projecting on to the lowest ll .",
    "these wave functions have been tested successfully for the case of fully polarized electrons @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath86 spectrum from @xmath87 to @xmath45 is related by reflection symmetry to the other half ( @xmath87 to @xmath88 ) .",
    "the horizontal lines of one side map into the tilted lines of the other side and vice - versa , and a cusp at @xmath86 also implies a cusp at @xmath89 .",
    "similar approximate mirror symmetry is also seen here in figs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) about @xmath90 in the interacting electron ground - states . in particular , the spin quantum numbers and the cusp sizes are ( approximately ) reflected about @xmath90 .    in the disk geometry",
    ", all cusps may not be associated with thermodynamic fqhe states , as indicated in ref .",
    "this is related to the fact that the iqhe state at @xmath91 can not in general be identified precisely .",
    "for fully spin - polarized electrons , the only exception is the @xmath92 state , which allows an identification of the laughlin states at @xmath93 ; the other cusps are not associated with any thermodynamic fqhe states . in the present case , with low zeeman energy ,",
    "the iqhe state at @xmath94 is the only state that can be identified unambiguously : for an even number of electrons , it occurs at @xmath95 .",
    "consequently , the cusp at @xmath96 can be a ssociated with the @xmath97 spin - singlet fqhe state , and the cusp at @xmath98 with the @xmath99 spin - singlet state .",
    "these are the last and the first cusps in the cf - kinetic energy curves .",
    "other cusps do not correspond to fqhe states .",
    "this study analyzes interacting lowest - ll electrons in quantum dots in the small zeeman energy limit in the framework of composite fermions , and shows that the prominent features are understood in terms of non - interacting composite fermions . for more detailed information ,",
    "it is necessary to incorporate the residual interaction between composite fermions . while the true interaction between composite fermions is necessarily quite complex , we find that any repulsive two - body interaction provides a reasonable qualitative picture .",
