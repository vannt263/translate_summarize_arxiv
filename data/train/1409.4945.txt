    "solid helium typifies an extreme quantum condensed - matter system . due to the light mass of the atoms and weak interparticle interactions ,",
    "quantum nuclear delocalization effects become crucially important in this crystal . at absolute zero temperature @xmath0he atoms move agitatedly around the equilibrium positions of their hexagonal closed packed ( hcp ) lattice , producing unusually large kinetic energies ( that is , comparable in magnitude to the potential energy ) , and major anharmonic effects .",
    "@xcite yet , it has been debated , based on the observations of non - classical rotational inertia phenomena , that @xmath0he crystals could behave partly as a fluid with zero viscosity .",
    "@xcite    in order to fully understand and make quantitative predictions on the quantum nature of solid @xmath0he , it is necessary to solve the corresponding master equations of quantum mechanics .",
    "this represents an extremely challenging mathematical problem due to the non - linearity of the equations involved and large number of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom to be considered . fortunately , at normal conditions helium atoms are , from an electronic band - structure point of view , very elementary particles thereby the @xmath0he@xmath0he interactions can be effectively modeled with simple analytical expressions that exclusively depend on the interatomic distances ( e.g. , lennard - jones and aziz like potentials ) .  @xcite by making use of these simplifications and employing advanced quantum simulation methods ( e.g. , quantum monte carlo ) , it has been possible to determine with tremendous accuracy and computational efficiency the ground - state properties of solid @xmath6he .  @xcite the same kind of approach has been successfully applied also to the study of similar systems like h@xmath7 , lih , lid , and ne .",
    "@xcite    a fundamental question that remains to be answered at the quantitative level is : how important quantum nuclear effects turn out to be in solid helium ( and other quantum crystals ) under increasing pressure ?",
    "as compression is raised the repulsive electrostatic interactions between neighboring electron clouds increase and consequently the atoms remain closer to their equilibrium positions in order to minimize their potential energy , @xmath8 . by other side , due to the non - commutativity between the position and momentum quantum operators , whenever atomic localization increases",
    "so does the kinetic energy , @xmath9 .",
    "namely , pressure acts by incrementing both @xmath8 and @xmath9 energies and it is not explicitly known how the @xmath10 ratio , which can be regarded as a quantum level indicator of the system , evolves under compression . answering to this and other similar questions",
    "is of paramount importance for modeling of materials in earth and planetary sciences , since light weight species like @xmath0he and h@xmath7 are believed to be abundant in the interior of celestial bodies .",
    "more precisely , determining the exact role of quantum nuclear effects in compressed quantum crystals will permit to fully justify or disapprove the use of approximate approaches , routinely employed in high - pressure studies ( e.g. , debye and quasi - harmonic models ) ,  @xcite for estimation of `` zero - point energies '' and other related quantities ( e.g. , phase transitions and atomic structure ) .",
    "quantifying the exact evolution of the energy in @xmath0he under pressure , however , is not a simple task . since compression profoundly affects the electronic structure of materials , the interaction models which at low pressures describe successfully @xmath0he atoms or h@xmath7 molecules turn out to be unreliable at high-@xmath11 conditions",
    "this fact seriously hinders the application of quantum monte carlo methods to their study . from an ideal point of view",
    ", one would like to describe both the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in quantum crystals fully from first principles , that is , without relying on any substantial approximation to the atomic interactions .",
    "nevertheless , such a strategy , although in principle is technically possible , it would require of an enormous amount of computational effort .",
    "thus , in practice effective and simpler quantum simulation methods able to deal with large systems ( i.e. , composed of @xmath12 atoms ) are highly desirable .    in this work ,",
    "we present a comprehensive computational study of the energy and structural properties of hcp @xmath0he at @xmath13  k and pressures up to @xmath2  gpa , based exclusively on first - principles methods . in particular , we employ density functional theory ( dft ) to access the electronic band - structure of the crystal and the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation that renders the behavior of the quantum nuclei . the effective pair interaction between nuclei",
    "is constructed by fitting the static compression curve obtained with dft to an analytical function based on the aziz potential  @xcite and an attenuation repulsion factor proposed by moraldi .",
    "@xcite we find that the @xmath10 ratio in solid @xmath0he is overall depleted with increasing pressure due to a very small  ( large ) increase of @xmath9  ( @xmath8 ) at compressions larger than @xmath14  gpa .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0he kinetic energy increases by no more than @xmath15  k in the pressure interval @xmath16  gpa . such a small @xmath9 increase illustrates the unique ability of @xmath0he atoms to remain extraordinarily delocalized within extremely dense environments as a result of their quantum correlations .",
    "accordingly , we find that the lindenmann ratio in compressed @xmath0he ( @xmath17  gpa ) amount to @xmath4 almost independently of the pressure .",
    "furthermore , we assess the performance of approximate quasi - harmonic dft methods in evaluation of kinetic energies at @xmath1  k and find that , in the best of the cases , these approaches exceedingly overestimate @xmath9 by @xmath5  % .",
    "quasi - harmonic approaches also turn out to be inadequate to describe the size of the @xmath0he displacements around their equilibrium lattice positions .",
    "thus , we resolve that quasi - harmonic dft methods are not able to describe the ground - state properties of dense helium correctly .",
    "the main conclusions presented in this work can be extended to other light and weakly interacting species like , for instance , h@xmath7 , methane ( ch@xmath18 ) and ammonia ( nh@xmath19 ) , wherein quantum nuclear effects are expected to be critically important .",

    "there , we present also our modeling strategy of the atomic interactions in solid @xmath0he at high @xmath11 .",

    "dft is a first - principles approach which has allowed for accurate and reliable knowledge of a great deal of materials with exceptional computational affordability .",

    "@xcite    it must be noted , however , that standard dft methods do not describe properly long - range dispersive interactions in solids , like for instance van der waals ( vdw ) forces , due to the local nature of the employed @xmath20 approximations .",
    "@xcite also , it is well - known that such a type of interactions plays a critical role in the cohesion of helium at low pressures .",
    "nevertheless , short - range effects in rare - gas systems become increasingly more relevant as pressure is raised .",

    "@xcite    in order to compute the qh free energy of a crystal , it is necessary to know its full phonon spectrum . for this , we employ here the `` direct approach '' and dft calculations . in the direct approach the force - constant matrix is directly calculated in real - space by considering the proportionality between the atomic displacements and forces when the former are sufficiently small .",
    "@xcite in this case , large supercells have to be constructed in order to guarantee that the elements of the force - constant matrix have all fallen off to negligible values at their boundaries , a condition that follows from the use of periodic boundary conditions .",
