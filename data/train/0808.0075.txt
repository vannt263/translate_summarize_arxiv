    "etwork coding @xcite is a new and promising design paradigm for modern communication networks : by allowing intermediate network nodes to mix the data or signals received from multiple links , as opposed to separating them by traditional approaches , network coding reduces the amount of transmissions in the network and thus improves the overall network throughput . recently , there has been increasing attention from the research community to apply the principle of network coding in wireless communication networks .",
    "in fact , wireless network is the most natural setting to apply network coding due to the broadcast property of radio transmissions , i.e. , a single transmission of one wireless terminal may successfully reach multiple neighboring terminals , without the need of dedicated links to these terminals as required in wireline networks . furthermore , network coding can potentially be a very effective solution to the classical `` interference problem '' in wireless networks , since it transforms the traditional approach of avoiding or mitigating the interference among wireless terminals into a new methodology of _ interference exploitation_.    the _ two - way relay channel _ ( twrc ) is one of the basic elements in decentralized / centralized wireless networks .",
    "the simplest twrc consists of two source nodes , s1 and s2 , which exchange information via a helping relay node , r. traditionally , in order to avoid the interference at r , simultaneous transmission of s1 and s2 is unadvisable at the same frequency .",
    "thus , in total four time - slots are usually required to accomplish one round of information exchange between s1 and s2 via r. however , by applying the idea of network coding , the authors in @xcite proposed a method to reduce the number of required time - slots from four to three . in this method , s1 first sends to r during time - slot 1 the message @xmath0 consisting of bits @xmath1 with @xmath2 denoting the message length in bits , and then r decodes @xmath0 . during time - slot 2 , s2 sends to r the message @xmath3 consisting of bits @xmath4 , and r decodes @xmath5 . in time - slot 3 ,",
    "r broadcasts to s1 and s2 a new message @xmath6 consisting of bits @xmath7 obtained by bit - wise exclusive - or ( xor ) operations over @xmath8 s and @xmath9 s , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "since s1 knows @xmath8 s , s1 can recover its desired message @xmath3 by first decoding @xmath6 and then obtaining @xmath9 s as @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , s2 can recover @xmath0 .",
    "the principle of network coding has been further investigated for twrc by exploiting various physical - layer relay operations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite is named as _ analogue network coding _ ( anc ) , while the one in @xcite named as _ physical - layer network coding _ ( pnc ) . for both anc and pnc ,",
    "the number of time - slots required for s1 and s2 to exchange one round of information is reduced from three @xcite to two , by allowing s1 and s2 to transmit simultaneously to r during one time - slot and thereby combining the first two time - slots in @xcite into one time - slot .",
    "anc and pnc differ in their corresponding relay operations , which are amplify - and - forward ( af ) and estimate - and - forward ( ef ) , respectively . in anc , r linearly amplifies the sum signal received from s1 and s2 , and then broadcasts the resulting signal to s1 and s2 .",
    "anc is based upon an interesting observation that the signal collision at r during the first time - slot is in fact harmless , since such a collision can be resolved at s1 ( s2 ) during the second time - slot by subtracting from its received signal the so - called _ self - interference _ , which is related to the previously transmitted message from s1 ( s2 ) itself .",
    "in contrast to anc , more sophisticated ( nonlinear ) operations than af are required at r for pnc @xcite-@xcite . instead of decoding messages",
    "@xmath0 from s1 and @xmath3 from s2 separately in two different time - slots like in @xcite , the ef method proposed in @xcite estimates at r the bitwise xors between @xmath12 s and @xmath13 s from the mixed signal of s1 and s2 , and re - encodes the decoded bits into a new broadcasting message @xmath6 ; each one of s1 and s2 then recovers the other s message by the same decoding method as that in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to first deploy multiuser decoding at r to decode @xmath0 and @xmath3 separately , and then jointly encode @xmath0 and @xmath3 into a new broadcasting message @xmath6 ; given the side information on @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) at s1 ( s2 ) , s1 ( s2 ) decodes @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the above decode - and - forward ( df ) relay operation for twrc has been studied in @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , twrc has also been studied in @xcite-@xcite from cooperative communication perspectives , with a major objective to compensate for the loss of spectral efficiency in the conventional _ one - way relay channel _",
    "( owrc ) owing to the half - duplex constraint .",
    "non - surprisingly , the solutions proposed therein are similar to those inspired by the principle of network coding .",
    "furthermore , twrc has been studied jointly with other physical - layer transmission techniques based on , e.g. , orthogonal - frequency - division - multiplexing ( ofdm ) @xcite , @xcite , and multiple transmit and/or multiple receive antennas @xcite-@xcite , to further improve the bidirectional relay throughput . for the multi - antenna twrc ,",
    "the df relay strategy was studied in @xcite , @xcite , the af relay strategy or anc was studied in @xcite , and the distributed space - time coding strategy for the relay was studied in @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the af-/anc - based multi - antenna twrc . assuming that s1 and s2 each has a single antenna and r has @xmath14 antennas , @xmath15",
    ", we study the optimal design of linear processing ( beamforming ) at the relay to achieve the capacity region of af-/anc - based twrc , which consists of all the achievable rate - pairs of s1 and s2 under the given transmit power constraints at s1 , s2 , and r. our main goal is to provide insightful guidelines on the design of af - based multi - antenna twrc , which differs from the results for the conventional af - based multi - antenna owrc given in , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we derive the optimal beamforming structure at r , which achieves the capacity region of an anc - based twrc .",
    "the optimal structure reduces the number of complex - valued design variables in the relay beamforming matrix from @xmath16 to 4 when @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , by transforming the capacity region characterization problem into an equivalent relay power minimization problem under certain signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) constraints at s1 and s2 , we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the globally optimal beamforming matrix based on convex optimization techniques .",
    "* inspired by the optimal relay beamforming structure , we propose two low - complexity suboptimal beamforming schemes , based on the principle of `` matched - filter ( mf ) '' and `` zero - forcing ( zf ) '' , respectively .",
    "we analyze their performances in terms of the achievable sum - rate in twrc against the maximum sum - rate , or the sum - capacity , achieved by the optimal scheme .",
    "it is shown that the zf - based relay beamforming with the objective of suppressing the uplink ( from s1 and s2 to r ) and downlink ( from r to s1 and s2 ) interferences at r may not be a good solution for the anc - based twrc , since these interferences are indeed self - interferences and thus can be later removed at s1 and s2 . on the other hand , it is shown that the mf - based relay beamforming , which maximizes the signal power forwarded to s1 and s2 , achieves the sum - rate close to the sum - capacity under various snr and channel conditions .",

    "as shown in fig . [ fig : system model ] , we consider a twrc consisting of two source nodes , s1 and s2 , each with a single antenna and a relay node , r , equipped with @xmath14 antennas , @xmath47 .",
    "all the channels involved are assumed to be flat - fading over a common narrow - band .",
    "it is assumed that the transmission protocol of twrc uses two consecutive equal - duration time - slots for one round of information exchange between s1 and s2 via r. during the first time - slot , both s1 and s2 transmit concurrently to r , which linearly processes the received signal and then broadcasts the resulting signal to s1 and s2 during the second time - slot .",
    "it is also assumed that perfect synchronization has been established among s1 , s2 , and r prior to data transmission .",
    "the received baseband signal at r in the first time - slot is expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the received signal vector at symbol index @xmath50 , @xmath51 , with @xmath2 denoting the total number of transmitted symbols during one time - slot ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the channel vectors from s1 to r and from s2 to r , respectively , which are assumed to be constant during the two time - slots ; and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the transmitted symbols from s1 and s2 , respectively . since in this paper we are interested in the information - theoretic limits of twrc , it is assumed that the optimal gaussian codebook is used at s1 and s2 , and thus @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent random variables both @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the transmit powers of s1 and s2 , respectively ; and @xmath59 is the receiver noise vector , independent over @xmath50 , and without loss of generality ( w.l.o.g . ) , it is assumed that @xmath60 . upon receiving the mixed signal from s1 and s2 ,",
    "r processes it with af relay operation , also known as _ linear analogue relaying _ , and then broadcasts the processed signal to s1 and s2 during the second time - slot .",
    "mathematically , the linear processing ( beamforming ) operation at the relay can be concisely represented as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the transmitted signal at r , and @xmath63 is the relay processing matrix .",
    "note that the transmit power of r can be shown equal to @xmath64 we can assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that channel reciprocity holds for twrc during uplink and downlink transmissions , i.e. , the channels from r to s1 and s2 during the second time - slot are given as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "thus , the received signals at s1 can be written as @xmath67 for @xmath51 , where @xmath68 s are the independent receiver noise samples at s1 , and it is assumed that @xmath69 . note that on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : rx signal s1 2 ] ) , the first term is the self - interference of s1 , while the second term contains the desired message from s2 . assuming that both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are perfectly known at s1 via training - based channel estimation @xcite prior to data transmission , s1 can first subtract its self - interference from @xmath72 and then coherently demodulate @xmath55 .",

    "similarly , it can be shown that the maximum achievable rate @xmath80 for the link from s1 to s2 via r satisfies @xmath81    next , we define the capacity region of anc - based twrc , @xmath82 , subject to transmit power constraints at s1 , s2 , and r , denoted by @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , respectively . first , for a fixed pair of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we define the achievable rate region for s1 and s2 as @xmath88 then , @xmath82 is defined as @xmath89 note that in ( [ eq : capacity region ] ) , @xmath82 can be obtained by taking the union over all the achievable rate regions , @xmath90 s , corresponding to different feasible pairs of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "optimal structures of @xmath76 can be further simplified in the following two special cases , which are _ case i _ : @xmath123 , i.e. , @xmath124 ; and _ case ii _ : @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath112 with @xmath113 being a constant .",

    "thus , in general we need to resort to optimization techniques to obtain the @xmath132 matrix @xmath122 for each boundary rate - pair of @xmath90 , as will be shown next .",
    "since @xmath90 in ( [ eq : rate region 2 ] ) is the same as that in ( [ eq : rate region ] ) , we use ( [ eq : rate region 2 ] ) in this subsection to characterize all the boundary rate - pairs of @xmath90 . a commonly used method to characterize different rate - tuples on the boundary of a multiuser capacity region is via solving a sequence of _ weighted sum - rate maximization _ ( wsrmax ) problems , each for a different ( nonnegative ) rate weight vector of users . in the case of twrc ,",

    "therefore , we need to resort to an alternative method of wsrmax to characterize @xmath90 . in @xcite , an interesting concept",
    "so - called _ rate profile _ was introduced to efficiently characterize boundary rate - tuples of a capacity region .",

    "in addition , the study of estimate - and - forward ( ef ) relay operations for the multi - antenna twrc is also appealing .",
