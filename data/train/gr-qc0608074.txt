    "a relativistic modified gravity ( mog ) called scalar - tensor - vector gravity ( stvg ) desribes a self - consistent , stable gravity theory that contains einstein s general relativity in a well - defined limit.@xcite the theory has an extra degree of freedom , a vector field called a `` phion '' field whose curl is a skew symmetric field that couples to matter ( `` fifth force '' ) .",
    "the spacetime geometry is described by a symmetric einstein metric .",
    "an alternative relativistic gravity theory called metric - skew - tensor gravity ( mstg ) has also been formulated@xcite in which the spacetime is described by a symmetric metric , and the extra degree of freedom is a skew symmetric second rank tensor field .",

    "the classical stvg theory allows the gravitational coupling `` constant '' @xmath0 and the coupling of the phion field and its effective mass to vary with space and time as scalar fields .",

    "dark matter in the form of particles has until now not been discovered in spite of large - scale experimental efforts.@xcite the accelerating expansion of the universe should be explained by the mog theory without postulating a cosmological constant .",

    "the bound ( [ perhbound ] ) requires that the coupling constant @xmath41 varies with distance in such a way that it is sufficiently small in the solar system regime and determines a value for @xmath35 that is in accord with the bound ( [ perhbound ] ) .    for terrestrial experiments and orbits of satellites ,",
    "we have also that @xmath63 and for @xmath66 sufficiently small , we then achieve agreement with all gravitational terrestrial experiments including etvs free - fall experiments and `` fifth force '' experiments .    for the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 the formula ( [ perihelionformula ] ) can be adapted to the periastron shift of a binary system . combining this with the stvg gravitational wave radiation formula , which will approximate closely the gr formula , we can obtain agreement with the observations for the binary pulsar .",

    "the radio tracking data from the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft during their travel to the outer parts of the solar system have revealed an anomalous acceleration . the doppler data obtained at distances @xmath30 from the sun between @xmath72 and @xmath73 astronomical units ( au ) showed the anomaly as a deviation from newton s and einstein s gravitational theories .",
