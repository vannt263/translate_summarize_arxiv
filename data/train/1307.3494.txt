    "low - dimensional quantum spin systems have attracted much interest because of their novel ground states dominated by strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "intensive studies have been done in the @xmath6-electron compounds such as the two dimensional @xmath7 dimer spin systems srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath2)@xmath8  @xcite and ( cucl)lanb@xmath8o@xmath9  @xcite , both of which have a singlet ground state .",
    "by contrast , not many @xmath10-electron compounds have been investigated from a standpoint of quantum spin systems .",
    "this is because @xmath10-electron compounds generally have a large total angular momentum @xmath11 that is equal to and above @xmath12 , which would hinder intersite quantum fluctuations .",
    "moreover , in the case of metallic @xmath10-electron compounds , either long - range ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interactions induce a magnetic ordering or a screening by the conduction electrons leads to a singlet kondo state .",
    "these features of @xmath10-electron compounds tend to disturb the realization of a quantum spin state . until recently",
    ", only yb@xmath13as@xmath2 has been known as a unique @xmath10-electron compound in which a one - dimensional pseudo - spin-@xmath14 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ground state is realized  @xcite .",
    "recently , ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 has been proposed to be another candidate for a @xmath10-electron quantum spin system .",
    "ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 crystallizes into a hexagonal scal@xmath2c@xmath2-type structure at room temperature , which consists of layers of a yb triangular lattice separated by al and c layers . at temperatures below about 80  k ( @xmath15 )",
    ", it exhibits a structural phase transition into an orthorhombic structure , accompanied by a slight displacement of the yb atoms  @xcite .",
    "ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 was revealed to have a low carrier concentration of about 0.01 per formula unit  @xcite and not to show any long - range magnetic ordering at temperatures down to 0.5  k  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath16 of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 in the high - temperature hexagonal phase at temperatures above 80  k indicates an effective yb moment of @xmath17 and a weiss temperature of @xmath18  k , depending on the field direction , implying the existence of a relatively large antiferromagnetic interaction between the localized yb@xmath19 moments  @xcite . in the orthorhombic phase",
    ", @xmath16 shows a broad peak around 10  k and becomes quite small at lower temperatures , suggesting a non - magnetic ground state with the development of a spin gap  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the specific heat @xmath20 measurements , a schottky - type anomaly was found around 5  k , whose entropy release was estimated to be exactly @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inelastic neutron scattering spectra exhibit three well - defined peaks around 1.5  mev , indicating the presence of low - energy magnetic excitations , and confirmed that the ground - state kramers doublet of yb@xmath19 was well separated from the excited levels by about 200  k  @xcite . from these facts",
    ", it has been proposed that the ground state kramers doublet of yb@xmath19 , which can be represented by a pseudo - spin 1/2 , forms an antiferromagnetic dimer state with a singlet - triplet energy gap @xmath22 of about 15  k  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the low - energy spectra in the inelastic neutron scattering experiment can be interpreted by using singlet - triplet excitations  @xcite .    for the clarification of the nature of the ground state of the spin - gap system , low - temperature magnetization @xmath0 measurements",
    "provide a powerful tool because @xmath23 depends on low - lying magnetic states . within an isolated dimer model ,",
    "the application of a magnetic field induces a step - like magnetization as @xmath24 reflecting a change in the ground state from a spin singlet to a triplet .",
    "in addition , in the presence of interdimer interactions and geometrical frustration , the degeneracy of the dimer triplet excited states is removed , and various ground states are expected to appear under magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , the two - dimensional @xmath7 dimer spin system srcu@xmath8(bo)@xmath2 exhibits magnetization plateaus at 1/8 , 1/4 , and 1/3 of the saturation magnetization , whose origins have been attributed to the formation of superstructures of the triplet state  @xcite .    in the case of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 , the mechanism of the dimer formation",
    "is not so obvious because the displacement of the yb atoms from the original triangular lattice is very small ( only @xmath25% )  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one might expect the interdimer interaction to be relatively strong ( the dimers are less isolated from each other ) . the previous @xmath0 measurements performed at temperatures down to 1.8  k revealed a broad metamagnetic increase in @xmath26 that could be interpreted as a singlet - triplet crossover  @xcite .",
    "in addition , quite recently , @xmath26 at fields up to 8  t was investigated at about 0.5  k , and multiple metamagnetic steps were found for @xmath3  @xcite , though several pieces of single crystals were used in the experiments . in order to further examine the nature of the singlet - triplet crossover in magnetic fields , we measured @xmath23 for _ one piece _ of a single - crystalline sample of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 at lower temperatures down to 0.1  k in higher magnetic fields up to 14.5  t.",
    "single crystals of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 were grown by using an encapsulated tungsten crucible  @xcite .",
    "the typical weight of the obtained crystal was at most several hundred micrograms .",
    "we measured @xmath23 of a tiny single crystal of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 by using a high - resolution capacitive faraday magnetometer with a vertical field gradient of 8 t / m in a dilution refrigerator  @xcite .",
    "we recently improved the sensitivity of the measurement by a factor of 100 over the previous apparatus , the details of which will be published elsewhere .    in this paper , we present the data obtained for two samples : sample a ( 0.16  mg ) and sample b ( 0.23  mg ) . because ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 is easily decomposed by a reaction with atmospheric oxygen , the sample was wrapped in silver foil with silver paste and then fixed firmly on the sample stage of the magnetometer by using ge varnish .",
    "therefore , a slight misalignment of the crystal orientation may have happened .",
    "in all the data presented , the background magnetization of the magnetometer was subtracted . for the measurements with @xmath5 , we cooled the sample slowly across @xmath27 in a magnetic field of 10  t applied along one of the three equivalent @xmath28 axes , so that the orthorhombic phase became a single - domain state .",
    "and ( b ) the differential susceptibility @xmath29 of sample a for @xmath5 at several temperatures .",
    ", width=307 ]    figure  [ mh_a](a ) shows the @xmath30 dependence of the magnetization , @xmath26 , of sample a for @xmath5 obtained at several temperatures . whereas @xmath26 is a gradually increasing function of @xmath30 at 4.2  k , the increase in @xmath0 becomes non - monotonic and steeper at lower temperatures . at the base temperature of 0.1  k , the differential susceptibility d@xmath0/d@xmath30 exhibits a kink at 4.8  t and a large peak at 6.6  t , as shown in fig .  [ mh_a](b ) . here",
    ", no hysteresis was detected down to 0.1  k between the field increasing and decreasing sweeps .",
    "the convex increase in @xmath26 at low fields below 2  t , which can be fitted using the brillouin function , is attributable to the decomposed yb@xmath19 impurities in the sample .     and ( b ) @xmath29 of sample a for @xmath3 at several temperatures . , width=307 ]",
    "the application of @xmath30 along the @xmath31 axis provides a more striking effect . as shown in fig .",
    "[ mh_c](a ) , the gradual increase of @xmath26 observed at 4.2  k becomes sharp and splits into multiple steps at lower temperatures .",
    "this feature can be seen more clearly in the d@xmath0/d@xmath30 data presented in fig .",
    "[ mh_c](b ) : a kink at around 7  t , which is similar to the one observed for @xmath5 at 4.7  t , and more than six peaks in the interval 7.5  t @xmath32  t were observed at 0.1  k. no appreciable hysteresis was observed for @xmath3 , either .",
    "these multiple steps resemble the fractional magnetization steps observed in srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath2)@xmath8  @xcite , though clear plateaus can not be resolved in the @xmath26 curve for sample  a.     of sample a at 0.1  k as a function of @xmath33 .",
    ", width=307 ]    in a previous report  @xcite , the @xmath30 and the @xmath34 dependences of @xmath0 of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 were examined at temperatures above 1.8  k and were compared by using the isolated dimer spin model with an effective anisotropic @xmath35 factor . in this model ,",
    "the magnetization normalized by the @xmath35-factor and the bohr magneton @xmath36 , which is labeled @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , or @xmath31 ) , is given by  @xcite @xmath40 here , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denote the number of yb ions , the temperature - independent susceptibility , and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath37 is expected to be scaled by @xmath33 ; @xmath37 increases rapidly and saturates to a value 0.5 at around @xmath44  t when @xmath45  k and @xmath46  k.    figure  [ mh_g ] presents @xmath47 and @xmath48 for ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 at 0.1  k as functions of @xmath33 , where the values of @xmath35 determined from a previous magnetic - susceptibility study  @xcite were used , and @xmath42 was adjusted so that @xmath26 in 5  t @xmath49  t was almost constant . as expected from eq .  , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 saturate to be about 0.45 at around @xmath50  t , which means that the magnetic moment of the pseudo - spin @xmath7 is almost fully polarized .",
    "however , the structures of the magnetization curves do not match between @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) keeps increasing with a gradual slope above @xmath51  t until it reaches about half ( quarter ) the saturation magnetization .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 behavior at low temperatures can not be explained by using the simple isolated dimer model .",
    "the ratio of the saturation fields , @xmath52 ( @xmath53  t ) , to the onset field of the triplet crossover , @xmath54 ( @xmath55  t ) , is estimated to be at most 1.5 for both @xmath5 and @xmath3 in ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 .",
    "this ratio is related to the strength of the interdimer interaction . in the isolated dimer model at 0  k , @xmath56 .",
    "by contrast , when the interdimer coupling is sufficiently strong , @xmath57 becomes larger because the interdimer interaction lifts the degeneracy of the triplet states and makes a wide triplet crossover or induces an ordered state .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath58 in ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 indicates that the interdimer interaction is not strong compared with other dimer systems , e.g. srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath2)@xmath8 ( @xmath59 )  @xcite , ( cucl)lanb@xmath8o@xmath9 ( @xmath60 )  @xcite , bacusi@xmath8o@xmath61 ( @xmath62 )  @xcite , and ba@xmath2cr@xmath8o@xmath63 ( @xmath62 )  @xcite .     and ( b )  @xmath3 .",
    "dashed lines are guides to the eye .",
    "the horizontal axis is a logarithmic scale .",
    ", width=307 ]    in fig .",
    "[ ht ] , we plot the position of a peak or a kink in d@xmath0/d@xmath30 as a function of temperature .",
    "we define three main regions : a dimer state at low fields , a transition region @xmath64 , and a fully - polarized state above @xmath52 .",
    "possibly , the transition region consists of a mixture of the singlet and the triplet states .",
    "a remarkable feature is the existence of various internal states in the transition region for @xmath3 at low temperatures represented by the several peaks in d@xmath0/d@xmath30 . because the boundary of the transition region is not likely to close in the @xmath65 plane",
    ", we consider that there is no long - range ordered state .     of sample",
    "a measured ( a ) in 7 , 6.9 , 6.8 , 6.7 , 6.6 , and 6.5 t for @xmath5 and ( b ) in fields of 10 , 9 , 8.5 , 8.35 , 8.1 , and 7.75 t for @xmath3 , respectively , from top to bottom .",
    ", width=307 ]    figures  [ mt](a ) and [ mt](b ) show the @xmath34 dependences of @xmath0 at several fields for @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively . in the field region where @xmath26 shows a steep increase , a rather strong increase of @xmath66",
    "was observed on cooling , although there is no distinct feature that could be ascribed to the manifestation of a phase transition .",
    "the stepwise increase in @xmath66 at 8.35  t for @xmath3 probably comes from the multiple magnetization steps in @xmath26 for this field direction .     and",

    "[ mh_c ] , we kept sample a in a vacuum desiccator .",

    "[ mh_c ] are also replotted in fig .",
    "[ sample - dep](a ) for comparison .",
    "a qualitative difference between the two data can be seen . in fig .",
    "[ sample - dep](b ) , the field range of the transition region becomes wider , and even clear plateaus appear .",
    "the impurity magnetization in low fields is also slightly enhanced , indicating that the sample is degraded and that the number of decomposed yb atoms has increased .",
    "obviously , the magnetization process of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 very much depends on the sample quality .",
    "this effect might originate from the partial release of the frustration that induced the distribution of the interdimer interaction .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the observed multiple magnetization steps are caused by such sample deterioration .",
    "figure  [ sample - dep](c ) shows the @xmath26 for sample b at 0.1  k , which was measured relatively soon after the growth .",
    "sample b can be seen to be of good quality because of less impurity magnetization in low fields .",
    "nevertheless , it shows clear multiple steps with sharp and large peaks of d@xmath0/d@xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the field range of the transition region for sample b is even slightly wider than that for sample a ( fig .",
    "[ sample - dep](a ) ) .",
    "note that the largest two peaks in d@xmath0/d@xmath30 are well separated for sample b whereas they tend to merge for sample a. these results strongly suggest that the multiple magnetization steps are intrinsic to the system and are not due to the sample deterioration .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath26 for sample b at different @xmath34 was not investigated before it had decomposed .",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath26 in ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 is well interpreted by using a singlet - triplet crossover in a spin - dimer system .",
    "in particular , the multiple magnetization steps observed for @xmath67 are reminiscent of the magnetization plateaus seen in the quantum dimer spin system srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath2)@xmath8 , whose origin is the formation of magnetic superstructures of localized triplets .",
    "it is highly interesting how the dimer state is realized in the nearly triangular lattice of yb ions in ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 .",
    "if the singlet - triplet crossover of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 is to be studied in more detail , careful investigations using a high - quality single crystal are essential .",
    "we have measured the magnetization of a single crystal of ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 at low temperatures down to 0.1  k and in magnetic fields up to 14.5  t. for both @xmath5 and @xmath3 , a steep increase of the magnetization ascribed to a single - triplet crossover , was observed at 1.8  k. with decreasing temperature , this crossover becomes sharp and splits into multiple steps . at the lowest temperature of 0.1  k ,",
    "multiple magnetization steps , which resemble the quantized magnetization plateaus found in the quantum dimer spin system srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath2)@xmath8 , were observed only for @xmath3 .",
    "we found that these multiple magnetization steps strongly depended on the sample quality .",
    "the width of the singlet - triplet crossover region for a good - quality sample was relatively narrow compared with those for other @xmath68 electron dimer systems .",
    "this might indicate that the effective interdimer interaction in ybal@xmath2c@xmath2 is not so strong in spite of the nearly triangular lattice configuration of yb atoms .",
