    "<S> graphene antidot lattices have recently been proposed as a new breed of graphene - based superlattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> we study electronic properties of triangular antidot lattices , with emphasis on the occurrence of dispersionless ( flat ) bands and the ensuing electron localization . apart from strictly flat bands at zero energy ( fermi level ) , </S>",
    "<S> whose existence is closely related to the bipartite lattice structure , we also find quasi - flat bands at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the real - space electron density profiles due to these localized states for a number of representative antidot lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the studied low - energy , localized states compete with states induced by the superlattice - scale defects in this system which have been proposed as hosts for electron spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we suggest that local moments formed in these midgap zero - energy states may be at the origin of a surprising saturation of the electron dephasing length observed in recent weak localization measurements in graphene antidot lattices . </S>"
