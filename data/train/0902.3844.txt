    "-to - interference ratio ( sir ) is an important entity in commucations engineering which indicates the quality of a link between a transmitter and a receiver in a multi transmitter - receiver environment ( see e.g. @xcite , among many others ) .",

    "the receiver background noise @xmath21 can be ignored and then    @xmath24    the author defines the following dynamic - system - version of `` signal - to - interference - ratio ( sir ) '' , denoted by @xmath25 , by rewriting the eq.([eq : cir ] ) with neural network terminology in @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath25 is the defined ficticious `` sir '' at time step @xmath18 , @xmath27 is the state of the @xmath15th neuron , @xmath28 is the feedback coefficient from its state to its input layer , @xmath29 is the weight from the output of the @xmath20th neuron to the input of the @xmath20th neuron . for the sake of brevity , in this paper",
