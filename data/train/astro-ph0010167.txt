    "planetary nebulae ( pns ) represent the last stages of evolution for stars of initial mass 18 @xmath1 .",
    "the central star that generates a pn has terminated its asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution , but its ejected stellar envelope has yet to disperse entirely , such that the star s newly exposed hot core ( the eventual white dwarf remnant ) ionizes and illuminates the envelope via uv radiation .",
    "the photoionized gas in a typical pn is far too cool to emit x - rays and the central stars are , at best , sources of very soft x - rays .",
    "however , theorists have long predicted that high - temperature x - ray emission should arise from a so - called `` hot bubble '' formed interior to the optically emitting ionized gas ( e.g. , kwok , purton , & fitzgerald , 1978 ; mellema & frank 1995 ) .",
    "the hot bubble is formed when the new , fast ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) wind emanating from the white dwarf rams into the ejected red giant envelope that is coasting outward at @xmath4 km s@xmath3 , in principle shock - heating the material to @xmath5 k.    _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ detected x - rays from more than a dozen planetaries ( de korte et al .",

    "a handful of planetaries do display rather hard spectra , in data obtained with the _ rosat _ position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "the brightest , hardest , and therefore most convincing example among the _ rosat _ pspc detections was the compact young planetary nebula bd @xmath7 3639 ( kreysing et al .",
    "1992 ) , whose high x - ray temperature ( @xmath8 k ) was subsequently confirmed by _ asca _",

    "leahy , kowk , & yin ( 2000 ) found the x - ray emitting region of   to be possibly extended in _",
    "rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) data .",
    "bd @xmath7 3639 is a fascinating object in many other respects as well .",
    "its youth is apparent from the compact morphology and low ionization state of its hii region , the low temperature of its central star ( @xmath9 30,000 k ) , and its large ratio of neutral to ionized gas mass ( sahai & trauger 1998 ; leahy et al.2000 ; and references therein ) . taken together",
    "these observations suggest that the onset of ionization in this nebula is a recent event .",
    "furthermore @xmath10 @xmath1 of its neutral gas is concentrated in a pair of diametrically opposed `` molecular bullets '' that have been expelled at @xmath11 km s@xmath3 ( bachiller et al.2000 ) .",
    "the presence of such highly confined molecular outflows is strongly suggestive of the presence of a binary companion to the central star ( see reviews in kastner , soker , & rappaport 2000a ) , and detection of these `` bullets '' called into question whether the interacting winds model was applicable to bd @xmath7 3639 ( bachiller et al .",
    "2000 ) .    with the launch of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    ", it is possible for the first time to obtain subarcsecond images of x - ray sources and simultaneously to perform moderate resolution x - ray spectroscopy , with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we report the unambiguous detection of extended x - ray emission from . in a second paper ( kastner , vrtilek , & soker 2000b ) we will present more detailed analysis of the  data .",
    "chandra observed , with acis as the focal plane instrument , on 2000 march 21 .",
    "the duration of the observation was 18.8 ks .",
    "the science instrument module was translated and the telescope was pointed such that the telescope boresight was positioned near the center of the spectroscopy ccd array ( acis - s ) and the image of  appeared on the central back - illuminated ccd ( device s3 ) . the acis - s3 pixel size is @xmath12 .",
    "the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) carried out standard pipeline processing on the raw acis event data , producing an aspect - corrected , bias - subtracted , graded , energy - calibrated event list , limited to grade 02346 events ( asca system ) . from this list",
    ", we constructed a broad - band ( 0.310.0 kev ) image and a pulse height spectrum .",
    "the image of  was smoothed by replacing raw pixel counts with the running mean in a @xmath13 pixel box .",
    "the spectrum was extracted using cxc software , which was used to construct a histogram of pulse heights for events contained within a circle of radius 10 pixels ( a radius we judged to include all of the x - ray flux from ) .",
    "the broad - band acis - s3 count rate within this aperture was 0.244 counts sec@xmath3 .",
    "the background count rate in a nearby , off - source region of equivalent area was negligible in comparison ( @xmath14 counts sec@xmath3 ) .",
    "the chandra image of shows an extended region of x - ray emission that appears to lie within , and is concentrated to one side of , the interior of the elliptical shell of ionized gas seen in high - resolution optical and ir images ( figs .  1 , 2 ) .",
    "the approximate extent of the x - ray emitting region is @xmath15 , or @xmath16 au ( for an assumed distance of @xmath17 kpc ; kastner et al .",
    "however , the x - ray emission is quite asymmetric in comparison to the optical and infrared morphologies of bd + 30 3639 , with a compact `` hot spot '' apparent toward the northeast rim of the optical / ir nebulosity and little or no emission toward the southwest rim .",
    "this result confirms the viability of the interacting winds model , but shows that another ingredient is necessary .",
    "in particular , the asymmetry suggests that the hot bubble is inhomogeneous in density , temperature , and/or abundance .",
    "alternatively , a spatially varying absorbing column may be responsible for the asymmetry ; note the close correspondence between the outline of x - ray emission and the inner `` hole '' seen in the ir nebulosity .",
    "the central star of  blows a fast wind at a velocity of @xmath18 km s@xmath3 ( leuenhagen , hamann , & jefferyet 1996 ) .",
    "the shocked fast wind is expected to have a temperature of @xmath19 k , and be distributed isotropically around the central star .",
    "however , we find here a much lower temperature ( see below ) , and the x - ray emission is localized and asymmetric , suggesting that the x - ray emission results from cooler , clumpy gas .",
    "such cooler and denser gas can result from mixing of the hot gas with cooler , nebular gas ( chu & ho 1995 ; arnaud et al .",
    "1996 ) and/or from the presence of a heat conduction front ( soker 1994 ) .",
    "the latter possibility suggests that magnetic fields play an important role in determining the asymmetric x - ray emission morphology of , since the presence of localized magnetic fields would suppress heat conduction , and therefore x - ray emission , in specific regions of the inner nebula ( soker 1994 ) .",
    "more detailed analysis is postponed to our next paper ( kastner et al .",
    "2000b ) .    the chandra / acis spectrum of bd @xmath7 3639 ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that nearly all the x - ray photons detected by acis have energies between 0.3 kev and 1.7 kev .",
    "the spectrum displays strong emission from a blend of he - like ne lines centered at 915 ev , and an apparent blend of emission lines ( and , possibly , continuum emission ) between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ev .",
    "fits of a variable - abundance mekal ( mewe  kaastra  liedahl collisional equilibrium ) model indicate that the abundance of c is enhanced relative to solar , ne is roughly solar , and n and o are depleted ; these fits also suggest negligible abundances for all elements heavier than ne .",
    "the apparent presence of significant continuum emission may indicate greatly enhanced he abundance , but this result is tentative given the modest spectral resolution of acis . from the model",
    "fitting we deduce an emitting region temperature of @xmath22 k ( @xmath233% ) , intervening absorbing column of @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath234% ) , and absorbed flux of @xmath26 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath3 . assuming @xmath27 kpc , the model normalization and intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) flux indicate , respectively , an emission measure of @xmath28 @xmath29 ( @xmath2312% ) and x - ray luminosity of @xmath30 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "this emission measure suggests an electron density @xmath31 @xmath29 , given the approximate diameter of the emitting region ; as noted above , however , the asymmetry of the chandra image suggests the emitting region is quite clumpy , and this result for @xmath32 should only be considered an average value .",
    "collectively , these results are consistent with those obtained by kreysing et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from rosat data and by arnaud et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from asca data , although analysis of the latter dataset was complicated by contamination from a nearby supernova remnant .",
    "the acis spectroscopy strongly suggests that the chemical abundances in the x - ray - emitting region are enriched in , and indeed may consist almost exclusively of , products of main sequence and post - main sequence nuclear burning .",
    "furthermore , the large ne abundance suggests that the nebula and white dwarf are the products of a relatively massive progenitor that obtained very high core fusion temperatures and , hence , efficient production of ne via the reaction @xmath33o",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37ne .",
    "this interpretation relies on the results for cno abundances , however , which can only be tentatively deduced given the modest resolution of the ccd spectrum .",
    "the abundance anomalies implied by the x - ray spectrum may also hint at the central star s binary nature ( soker & rappaport 2000 ) .",
