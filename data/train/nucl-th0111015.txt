    "if we require the interactions to be local and manifestly covariant under the poincar group , we are led to a local relativistic quantum field theory with particle production and annihilation @xcite . in this case",
    "the poincar transformations of all matrix elements can be shown to depend only on the kinematics ( i.e.  they depend only on the masses and spins of the external particles ) .",
    "the disadvantage is that the number of particles is not conserved .",
    "if perturbation theory can be used , this approach is very successful , but in the nonperturbative regime of strong coupling meson theory it leads to an infinite set of coupled equations that can not be solved in closed form .",
    "numerical , nonperturbative solutions of field theory can be obtained in euclidean space for a few special cases @xcite .",
    "methods that limit the intermediate states to a _ fixed number of particles _ ( two nucleons in this case ) are more tractable , and all modern calculations are based on the choices depicted in the decision tree shown in fig .",
    "[ decision ] .    in deciding which method to use , if is first necessary to decide whether or not to allow _ antiparticle , or negative energy _",
    "nucleons to propagate as part of the virtual intermediate state .",
    "since nucleons are heavy and composite , so that their antiparticle states are very far from the region of interest , some physicists believe that intermediate states should be built only from positive energy nucleons , and that all negative energy effects ( if any ) should be included in the interaction .",
    "these methods are referred to collectively as _ hamiltonian dynamics _ and are represented by the left hand branch in the figure .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that this choice precludes the possibility of retaining the properties of locality and manifest covariance enjoyed by field theory .",
    "alternatively , in order to keep the locality and manifest covariance of the original field theory , other physicists are willing to allow negative energy states into the propagators .",
    "these methods , represented by the right - hand branch of the figure , are referred to collectively as _",
    "propagator dynamics_. including negative energy states tends to make calculations technically more difficult and harder to interpret physically , and those who advocate the use of hamiltonian dynamics do not believe the advantages of exact covariance justify the work it requires .",
    "unfortunately , these two methods are so fundamentally different that many physicists do not realize that the limitations of one may not apply to the other .",
    "for example , for some choices of propagator dynamics all 10 of the generators of the poincar group will depend only on the kinematics , and the poincar transformations of _ all amplitudes can be done exactly_. with hamiltonian dynamics this is not the case ; some of the 10 generators must depend on the interaction , and transformation of matrix elements under these `` dynamical '' transformations must be calculated .",
    "comparison of the two methods is therefore very difficult ; the language and issues of each are very different and one can be easily misled by the different appearance of the results .",
    "we can not discuss these issues in detail in this review , and refer the reader to two recent references that survey the subject @xcite . here",
    "we will give a short review of some recent calculations , and explain these differences as we go along .",
    "propagator calculations all start from the field theory description of two ( in this case ) interacting particles .",
    "while some may prefer to express the field theory as a path integral , it is also possible to adopt a more intuitive approach and imagine expanding the path intergral as a sum of feynman diagrams ( ignoring issues of convergence for the moment ) . in order to generate the deuteron bound state , which produces as a pole in the scattering matrix ,",
    "it is necessary to sum an infinite class of diagrams , written as @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the _ kernel _ being iterated , @xmath271 the two body propagator , @xmath272 the scattering amplitude , and the other quantities are defined below .",

    "the geometric series converges only when @xmath276 , but its unique analytic continuation , @xmath275 , is valid for all @xmath277 .",
    "similiarly , it is assumed that the solution to ( [ rel1 ] ) is valid even when the series ( [ sumdiag ] ) diverges . and",

    "[ fig : dgpobs410 ] shows that neither the shape nor strength of the angular distribution is accurately reproduced ; this will become clearer when we examine the energy dependence of @xmath10 at @xmath746 = 90@xmath140 below .",
    "figure  [ fig : dgpsigmas ] shows the published high energy photodisintegration data , from experiments ne8 @xcite and ne17 @xcite at slac , and e89 - 012 @xcite and e96 - 003 @xcite at jlab .",
    "these experiments determine cross sections for @xmath746 @xmath151 36@xmath140 , 52@xmath140 , 69@xmath140,and 89@xmath140 at energies from about 0.7 to 5.5 gev ; there are also some backward angle data up to 1.8 gev from ne8 .",
    "these data overlap well ; the experiments , while all run by essentially the same collaboration , used three spectrometers in two experimental halls at two laboratories .",
    "there is also good overlap , variations of less than about 20% , with the highest energy mainz tagged photon data @xcite , and with older untagged data @xcite .",
    "tagged photon measurements at low energies provide an accurate measure of beam flux , and along with the measured proton angle and energy , can determine a missing mass that allows background rejection . at high energies ,",
    "smaller cross sections can not be determined with the reduced flux of tagged photons .",
    "the bremstrahlung endpoint technique was used for all of the slac and jlab measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgpsigmas ] .    in the endpoint technique ,",
    "the measured proton momentum vector determines the incident photon energy and neutron kinematics , _ assuming _ the reaction is two body photodisintegration .",
    "low momentum protons are cut from the analysis to prevent contamination from final states such as @xmath813 , while high momentum protons are cut to eliminate the larger uncertainty in the photon flux close to the photon endpoint .",
    "backgrounds are determined by radiator out and empty target measurements , and subtracted .",
    "events in the region beyond the endpoint can be used to check the subtraction .",
    "the increase in time required for this subtraction makes it prohibitive for the highest energy measurements ; for these the electrodisintegration background is calculated @xcite and subtracted . to determine the cross section ,",
    "the incident photon flux is calculated using the method of ref .",
    "thick radiator corrections are typically about 15% for a radiator thickness of 6% of a radiation length .",
    "the main feature of the cross section data above about 1 gev is the @xmath794 ( @xmath814 ) fall off of the cross sections @xmath815 ( @xmath812 ) at @xmath746 = 90@xmath140 and 69@xmath140 , in agreement with the ccr and thus with perturbative qcd expectations .",
    "in contrast , the cross sections at the forward angles 36@xmath140 and 52@xmath140 fall off more slowly , with approximate @xmath816 scaling at lower energies until the onset of the @xmath794 behavior at about 4 and 3 gev beam energy , respectively . at each angle",
    ", the onset of the @xmath794 behavior corresponds to @xmath789 @xmath151 1 gev .    the rna and the radyushkin estimates in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgpsigmas ] were normalized to the datum at 89@xmath137 and @xmath817 gev , fixing their one free parameter .",
    "the rna is then almost a factor of 2 too large at 36@xmath137 , and also much too large at lower energies , requiring that the soft physics missing from the rna interfere _ destructively _ with the leading terms .",
    "suggested angular dependences of @xmath818 ) @xcite would increase the rna curve further at the forward angles , worsening agreeement with the data .",
    "in contrast , the radyushkin estimate gives a somewhat better account of both the angular and energy dependence ( even though it only goes asympotically as @xmath814 ) , confirming that phase space and nucleon form factors are all that is needed to account for much of the kinematic variation of the cross section .",
    "while the apparent onset of scaling at the forward angles suggests this agreement is starting to break down , we conclude the present data are insufficient to uniquely fix the asymptotic energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "the cross section data are also reasonably well reproduced by the model of frankfurt , miller , strikman and sargsian [ fmss ] @xcite and the quark gluon string ( qgs ) model @xcite .",
    "the predictions of fmss are uncertain because ( a ) the high energy @xmath7 scattering data has an uncertain energy dependence reflecting the experimental errors , and ( b ) the extrapolation of the @xmath7 data required for the predictions introduces further errors .",
    "these two uncertainties combine to give the jagged region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgpsigmas ] .",
    "the qgs model describes the forward angle data up to 4 gev reasonably well , even for values of @xmath803 exceeding the nominal limits of the model .",
    "the newer work @xcite predicts that the angular distributions will become increasingly symmetric at higher energies ; older estimates @xcite had predicted an increasing _",
    "two experiments currently have unpublished data for cross sections at photon energies up to 2.5 gev .",
    "jlab hall b e93 - 017 @xcite used the clas with tagged photons to determine nearly complete angular distributions .",
    "the preliminary data agree well with earlier measurements , but are much more comprehensive than previous measurements in this energy range .",

    "[ fig : ad ] shows a sample angular distribution at approximately 1.6 gev .",
    "there are only three sets of polarization data for deuteron photodisintegration at energies near and above 1 gev .",
    "the induced polarization @xmath10 was measured at kharkov @xcite , the @xmath718 asymmetry was measured at yerevan @xcite , and @xmath10 and the polarization transfers @xmath11 and @xmath12 were measured at jlab @xcite .",

    "the kharkov measurements of @xmath10 at @xmath746 @xmath127 90@xmath140 and 120@xmath140 extend up to about 1.1 gev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:89019py ] ) .",
    "these experiments were very difficult .",
    "the small duty factor at kharkov increases instantaneous background rates a factor of about 20,000 over those at jlab .",
    "these large backgrounds made it necessary to use multiple spark chambers to track particle trajectories .",
    "it was also difficult to calibrate the polarimeter .",
    "calibrations of a polarimeter are best done by measuring its analyzing power using the known @xmath819 elastic scattering reaction @xcite , but kharkov had no polarized beam .",
    "the kharkov measurements relied on a single elastic @xmath158 point to check false asymmetries in their polarimeter , and used analyzing powers from the literature . finally , the polarimeter had a rear trigger scintillator ; any inefficiencies in the scintillator would lead to false asymmetries .",
    "in contrast , the recent jlab experiment @xcite had little background , used @xmath820 calibrations to determine false asymmetries and analyzing powers at each kinematic setting , and had no rear trigger scintillator . given the clear disagreement of the kharkov data with the recent jlab data , and noting that one of us ( rg ) is a spokesperson of the jlab experiment , we conclude that the highest energy set of karkov data should not be trusted .",
    "the induced polarizations shown in fig .  [ fig:89019py ] confirm our comments above concerning the bonn calculation .",
    "the large negative polarization near 500 mev is not reproduced , and the calculation is qualitatively incorrect at higher energies . the imaginary part of the amplitude appears to be a problem in these meson - baryon calculations ; presumably this arises from an inadequate treatment of resonances .    taken together ,",
    "these recoil polarization data only weakly confirm the predictions of hhc , which predicts that @xmath10 and @xmath11 should approach zero as @xmath821 , and that ( with additional assumptions @xcite about relations between the helicity conserving amplitudes at @xmath746 = 90@xmath140 ) @xmath822 and @xmath823 as @xmath821 .",
    "the highest energy polarization measurements of @xmath10 show that it is consistent with vanishing at energies above about 1 gev , the same energy at which the @xmath794 cross section scaling begins .",
    "[ in the radyushkin model @xmath10 should be zero because the amplitudes are all real if there is no gluon exchange @xcite . ]",
    "similiarly , the polarization transfer observables @xmath11 and @xmath12 both appear to peak near 1 gev , and decrease at higher energies .",
    "however , @xmath11 does not appear to vanish sufficiently rapidly ; the data might be inconsistent with hhc .",
    "so @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( and perhaps @xmath11 ) seem to have close to the correct behavior , but @xmath718 does not .",
    "the highest energy @xmath718 asymmetry measurements from yerevan , with data up to about 1.6 gev , give the immediate impression that there is a minimum near 1.2 gev and that above this energy the asymmetry is tending to increase towards 1 , although the data are also statistically consistent with a constant value of about 0.3 .",
    "in either case the trend is clearly not consistent with @xmath824 .    in models based on meson - baryon degrees of freedom ,",
    "the data indicate that the combined effects of resonances plus final - state interactions are small .",
    "calculations of @xmath10 in meson baryon theories @xcite indicate that @xmath10 at higher energies arises largely from resonance - background interference , with a small contribution from final - state interactions .",
    "calculations generally indicate that the @xmath604 resonance generates a large polarization , though only perhaps about 50% of the magnitude seen in the experimental data at @xmath746 @xmath127 90@xmath140 .",
    "the roper and @xmath742 have small effects , while the @xmath743 has a large effect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath825 , included only by the bonn group @xcite , also generates a large polarization .",
    "( of the 17 resonances included in the bonn calculation @xcite , only those mentioned above had large effects on @xmath10 . ) as discussed above , it is hard to imagine that a theoretically acceptable high energy model based on hadronic degrees of freedom will be constructed in the near future . still , a modern relativistic calculation based on hadronic degrees of freedom would nonetheless be desirable .    a calculation of @xmath10 has been done in the model of fmss @xcite . since the helicity amplitudes in the nucleon - nucleon scattering for this center of mass energy range are not uniquely determined , some modelling was needed .",
    "the calculation showns that @xmath10 is generally very small , going from a negative value at low energies to positive values at several gev beam energy , and is consistent with the trend of the experimental results .",
    "the polarization observable @xmath695 is also expected to be small , and opposite in sign to @xmath10 , while @xmath826 is expected to vanish .",
    "the rapid falloff of photodisintegration cross sections with energy makes extension of the measurements difficult . as beam energy increases from 4 to 5 , 6 , and 7 gev ,",
    "the @xmath794 dependence reduces cross sections by factors of 6 , 30 , and 115 , respectively .",
    "only a few experiments are possible without the proposed 12 gev upgrade to jlab . as indicated in table  [ dexptab ] , there are two approved experiments to continue the hall a recoil polarization measurements to additional angles , and to beam energies near 3 gev",
    ". measurements of the @xmath718 asymmetry are possible in jlab hall b , over a range of angles and energies well over 1 gev .    in the longer term ,",
    "the jlab 12 gev upgrade offers additional possibilities . the luminosity increase planned for",
    "hall b would allow precise polarization measurements to continue above 2 gev .",
    "the proposed mad spectrometer for hall a @xcite would give about a factor of 5 improvement in solid angle , and if it has the low backgrounds characteristic of the current hrs spectrometers , cross section measurements are possible up to 7 gev and polarization measurements are possible up to 4 gev .",
    "review of deuteron photodisintegration suggests the following :    * a microscopic meson - baryon theory of deuteron photodisintegration must describe the @xmath7 interaction at high energies , including pion production and the contributions of hundreds of @xmath827 channels .",
    "it is unlikely that such a theory will be constructed in the foreseeable future .",
    "the data might indicate that the effect of many resonances is to increase the cross section and decrease the polarization observables ( by averaging over may phases ) .",
    "this suggests that it might be possible to construct an effective theory based on hadronic degrees of freedom . * for @xmath788 greater than about 1 gev@xmath42 ,",
    "cross sections appear to follow the constituent counting rules , but it is expected that an absolute pqcd calculation of the size of the cross section would give a result much too small .",
    "similar observations may be made for other photoreactions , and it remains to be seen how this behavior arises , and if there is a general explanation for it . * the energy dependence of the photodisintegration cross sections has been shown to be potentially misleading indicator of the success of pqcd .",
    "models with asymptotic behavior which differ from pqcd fit the data as well or better than pqcd . further theoretical",
    "development and experimental tests of nonperturbative quark models would be desirable .",
    "the new high energy measurements of the deuteron form factors and the deuteron photodisintegration observables have motivated much theoretical work .",
    "in particular :    * conventional meson theory works well in cases where all of the _ active _ hadronic channels that can contribute to a process are included in the calculations .",
    "this has been done for the deuteron form factors ( where only the @xmath7 channel is active ) , but not for high energy deuteron photodisintegration where 100 s of @xmath8 channels are active . at high energy",
    "any successful meson theory must include relativistic effects .",
    "* new approaches , probably using quark degrees of freedom , are needed for high energy deuteron photodisintegration . while photodisintegration ( as well as other reactions ) seem to follow the scaling laws , theoretical estimates using pqcd give cross sections orders of magnitude too small .",
    "the data do not support hadronic helicity conservation . thus scaling",
    "is no longer seen as sufficient evidence for the applicability of pqcd .",
    "there is good evidence that , in this energy region , the deuteron is undergoing a transition from a region in which conventional hadronic degrees of freedom describe the physics to a region in which quark degrees of freedom are more appropriate .",
