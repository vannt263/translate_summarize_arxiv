    "the theoretical concept of the _ ideal _ black body which completely absorbs all incident rays @xcite is widely used in thermodynamics , optics , and radio engineering .",
    "many important applications would benefit from close - to - ideal absorbers , including light harvesting , thermal emission , stealth , decoupling of antennas and other devices , etc .",
    "motivated by these prospects , significant research and development efforts have been devoted to realization of absorbers which would offer performance close to that of the ideal black body , see review papers @xcite . most of the known results concern planar absorbers , effective for a limited range of incidence angles .",
    "omnidirectional realizations using inhomogeneous lossy media have been proposed @xcite and an experimental test at microwave frequencies has been performed @xcite . a theoretical possibility to perfectly absorb waves of all polarizations coming from all directions",
    "is based on the idea of the _ perfectly _ matched layer ( pml ) as a layer which produces no reflections @xcite .",
    "all these concepts imply that the body fully absorbs all propagating waves incident on its surface , emulating the _ ideal black body .",
    "_ but are these objects truly _ perfect _ absorbers or can we perhaps do even better and extract energy also from evanescent fields created by arbitrary sources ? indeed , the perfectly matched layer produces no reflections and fully absorbs power of all propagating modes ( in the ideal case , realizing the properties of the perfect black body ) , but evanescent fields of sources are not affected by the presence of the perfectly matched layer ; thus , no energy is extracted from them .",
    "basically , within the known paradigm of uniaxial perfectly matched layers @xcite , there is a conundrum between perfect absorption of all propagating waves and extraction of power from evanescent fields .",
    "if the conditions for perfect absorption of propagating fields are satisfied , evanescent modes are not absorbed at all . if the parameters of the absorber are modified so that some power is extracted from evanescent fields of the source , the propagating modes are not any more fully absorbed .",
    "in other words , evanescent fields of sources contribute to absorbed power in lossy media , but within all known realization scenarios it appears that if the properties of lossy media are chosen so that all the propagating modes are perfectly absorbed , evanescent fields do not any more interact with the body .",
    "a typical example is a possibility to extract power from near fields of small sources , which has been discussed in the context of hyperbolic media electromagnetics @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic media are artificial materials ( metamaterials ) , whose permittivity tensor is indefinite , so that the real parts of its different diagonal components have the opposite signs . due to the hyperbolic shape of isofrequency contours , evanescent waves exciting a planar interface of a hyperbolic material sample",
    "are partially converted to propagating modes @xcite within the medium and can be effectively absorbed there if the material is lossy @xcite .",
    "however , lossy hyperbolic bodies are not effective absorbers for incident propagating waves .",
    "actually , an interface between free space and a hyperbolic medium can be matched if the anisotropy axis is titled with respect to the interface , but only for one incidence angle @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study possibilities to create bodies which would act as perfect absorbers for _ all _ spatial harmonics of incident radiation , both propagating and evanescent .",
    "conceptually , such an ideal absorber is able to extract _",
    "infinite _ power from a finite - size emitter located at a finite distance , limited only by the power of the source which feeds the emitting object ( a generic antenna ) .",
    "this study is motivated by the results of theoretical studies which prove that a finite - size body , which is _ conjugate impedance matched _ with respect to its environment _ at all spatial spectrum components _ , has infinite relative absorptivity when compared to the classical ideal black body @xcite of the same size , e.g. refs .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , only an idealized realization of such a conjugate matched absorber as a non - uniform , locally isotropic double - negative ( dng ) sphere has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a sense ,",
    "such object acts as a perfect sink for all incident spherical waves characterized by arbitrary transverse wave numbers , but its practical realization is challenging because very low levels of material losses are required . here",
    ", we show how one can possibly create absorbers which are nearly perfectly working with both propagating and evanescent incident waves using uniaxial dng materials , both for planar boundaries and curved surfaces . in this new scenario , there are practical possibilities for realizations as well - studied uniaxial backward - wave structures ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : realization ] ) .",
    "since our proposed structures are not only able to absorb all propagating waves but can also extract power from the evanescent modes , the total extracted power can go far beyond what can be attained with know metamaterial black holes @xcite and even the ideal black body . in other words , we can go beyond `` the perfect absorber '' . from the physical point of view , the conjugate matching condition for evanescent modes is similar to the condition of existence of resonant surface modes , which can help to increase exchange of thermal radiation between two closely located bodies @xcite .",
    "however , in the proposed scenario it is possible to realize the optimal conjugate matching for _ all _ modes , both propagating and evanescent , that is , create the ultimately effective sink for electromagnetic energy from objects located at arbitrary distances .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on harvesting energy from small sources in their near - field zone , but we also discuss more general realizations of perfect finite - size absorbers for far - zone sources ( plane - wave illumination ) , that have been also proposed in paper @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the classical circuit - theory concept of conjugate impedance matching of a load , which is the condition for maximizing the power delivered to the load from a generator . referring to fig .",

    "the optimal approach is to ensure that the load impedance is conjugate matched with the source impedance .",

    "this fact was noticed in paper @xcite , in studies of maximizing radiative heat flow between two bodies . as a possible approach to realizing the conjugate match condition for all modes , in paper @xcite it was proposed to insert dense arrays of thin conducting wires into both bodies ( orthogonally to the interface ) , which makes the wave impedances of a wide range of modes approximately real .",
    "this approach is clearly not possible if the sources are in free space , and in this paper we will study means to ensure all - mode conjugate matching by properly selecting the material parameters of the absorbing body .",

    "as is clear from the above results , two scenarios are promising for realizations of the proposed conjugate matched bodies : the nonactive route and the pml route . in the nonactive route , the required material parameters correspond to well - studied uniaxial double - negative ( backward - wave ) metamaterials @xcite . a wide variety of micro- and nanostructures which realize double - negative response in different frequency ranges",
    "have been proposed and studied in the literature . for the new application proposed here",
    ", the materials should have a controllable degree of anisotropy : in particular , the case when the absolute values of the tangential components are much larger than those of the normal components is of interest . with this in view , one of the most promising topologies is the so - call fishnet structure @xcite .",
    "this is a multilayer structure where thin metal sheets with periodically positioned holes ( usually of the square or round shape ) are separated by dielectric spacers .",
    "while the response in the tangential plane is strongly modified by large induced currents flowing along the metal sheets , the response to fields along the normal direction is modified only due to quasi - static electric polarization of thin sheets . in the microwave domain ,",
    "the normal components of the material parameters usually have positive real parts . to achieve the necessary negative permittivity value of the normal component ,",
    "it is possible to insert an array of thin metal wires passing through the holes in the fishnet layers .",
    "if the wires are made of a good conductor , the microwave response will correspond to a negative and nearly real value of the normal component of the permittivity tensor , exactly as required for the cml realization .    at infrared and optical frequencies ,",
    "it is possible to exploit the negative permittivity of metals from which the fishnet layers can be fabricated . in this case ,",
    "metal wires are not needed , and the values of the normal component of the permittivity can be controlled by choosing the thickness ratio of the metal and dielectric layers in the fishnet structure . in particular , if rectangular holes are etched in a layer of magnesium fluoride ( mgf@xmath208 ) sandwiched between silver slabs , one can achieve negative refractive index @xcite at the optical frequencies under the necessary homogenization conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonlinearity of liquid crystals can be exploited in order to develop tunable fishnets metamaterials whose reflection / transmission ( and accordingly their effective @xmath209 ) is externally controlled .",
    "more generally speaking , it is well known that if we insert metallic particles such as cylindrical pins , strips , spirals or flakes , which are having negative permittivity in the visible spectrum @xcite , we can @xcite obtain materials with @xmath210<0 $ ] .",
    "the conclusion that the performance of nonactive - route cml improves when the absolute value of the real part of the tangential permittivity increases ( section  [ sec : planar ] ) is very important for choosing practically realizable material parameters . as was discussed above , high absorption of energy from evanescent fields requires that the overall losses in the medium are small ( this is in fact clear already from eq .  ( [ conj_match ] ) ) .",
    "realization of passive low - loss dng metamaterials is a challenge , although some successful approaches are known , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , for the nonactive pml with large magnitudes of negative @xmath109 , high absorption is observed even when the imaginary part of the tangential permittivity @xmath121 is not very small and corresponds to practically realizable structures",
    ". the normal component of the permittivity in this case corresponds to epsilon - near - zero materials , which are also known to be practically realizable @xcite .",
    "the required overall small level of losses can achieved also using active ( pumped ) structures .",
    "this can be done by using active parts such as optically pumped laser dyes to balance the losses of the background structure @xcite . in this way",
    ", one can realize an effective dng medium possessing additional negative normal components ( @xmath210<0 $ ] ) with controllable loss factors of the tangential components : @xmath60 , { { \\rm im}}[\\mu_{rt}]<0 $ ] .",
    "active control of the normal permittivity and permeability components can be used to implement also the active pml route towards cml .",
    "based on the fishnet - wire medium approach described above , instead of metallic rods or spirals one can insert nano - generators @xcite or pumps @xcite into the holes of the background structure which can provide energy to the system and make the normal component of the effective parameters active .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced the concept of double - negative _ conjugate matched layer _ ( cml ) , which has the property of acting as the ideal sink for energy of electromagnetic fields .",
    "arbitrary propagating waves illuminating such layer produce no reflections and are fully absorbed in the medium .",
    "evanescent fields , existing in the vicinity of small sources or scatterers , induce very strong resonant fields , oscillating in the vicinity of the cml surface .",
    "the energy stored in the reactive evanescent modes sinks into the layer and is transformed into heat or delivered to loads in its constitutive elements .",
    "there is an analogy of this phenomenon and the circuit - theory concept of the ideal voltage or current source .",
    "an ideal voltage source delivers infinite power to the load in the limit of infinitely small resistive load [ eq .",
    "( [ conj_match ] ) ] , because the current through a resistor tends to infinity when the resistance tends to zero .",
    "likewise , for every evanescent mode the sum of the wave impedances of fields in free space and that in the cml is real and can be made very small .",
    "thus , the layer dramatically enhances the near fields created by given sources and sacks their energy into the material layer .",
    "this phenomenon can be compared also with the purcell effect of enhancement of spontaneous emission rate of small sources due to the presence of resonant and efficiently radiating bodies in the vicinity of the source @xcite",
    ". however , resonant cavities or antennas used to enhance radiation from a small emitter work only at one or a few resonant modes of the resonator .",
    "the introduced cml concept brings the purcell effect to the limit of extracting _ all _ available energy from a small source . in this paradigm ,",
    "every mode of the source field resonates with a corresponding mode of the cml , so that the complete system of the source and the absorbing body is tuned for the optimal power extraction from _ all _ modes of the fields created by the source .",
    "although the ideal double - negative conjugate matched layer requires active inclusions for its practical realization @xcite ( the normal components of the material parameters have the imaginary parts corresponding to active media ) , the flexibility of the cml concept suggests a more practical possibility for realizations , where only passive materials are used : the nonactive route , described in this paper , requires double - negative _ lossy _ values of the tangential components and low - loss negative values of the normal components of the permittivity and permeability matrices .",
    "the results of extensive studies of various possibilities to design and realize double - negative ( backward - wave ) materials can be used to realize the proposed structures .",
    "while the earlier introduced isotropic double - negative design @xcite requires very small levels of losses , which are probably not possible to achieve in practice , at least with the use of only passive materials , the radially uniaxial double - negative structure proposed here appears to offer possibilities to overcome this limitation .",
    "we hope that the results of this study will have interesting and important implications for a wide variety of applications : in light harvesting , thermal emission control , heating and cooling devices , stealth , decoupling of radiators , receiving and transmitting antennas , and other microwave and optical devices .",

    "<S> we derive the conditions on the constitutive parameters of media which can serve as cml materials , numerically study the performance of planar and cylindrical cml and discuss possible realizations of such materials as metal - dielectric composites .    * </S>",
