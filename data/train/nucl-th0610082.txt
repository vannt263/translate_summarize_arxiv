    "these direct reaction theories are essential to interprete indirect methods used in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "we discuss coulomb dissociation @xcite and the trojan horse method , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "coulomb dissociation was reviewed in 2003 @xcite , a comprehensive paper on the trojan horse method appeared in @xcite .",
    "a more recent ( mini)review of indirect methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we report on the effective range theory of low - lying electromagnetic strength in one - nucleon halo nuclei @xcite , and its extension to two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "this will be of special interest in view of recent rather accurate experimental results on the low - lying electric dipole strength in @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "the trojan - horse method @xcite is a particular case of transfer reactions to the continuum under quasi - free scattering conditions .",
    "special attention is paid to the transition from reactions to bound and unbound states and the role of subthreshold resonances @xcite .",
    "since the binding energies of nuclei close to the drip line tend to be small , this is expected to be an important general feature in exotic nuclei .",
    "at low energies the effect of the nuclear potential is conveniently described by the effective - range expansion @xcite .",
    "an effective - range approach for the electromagnetic strength distribution in neutron halo nuclei was introduced in @xcite and applied to the single neutron halo nucleus @xmath1be .",
    "recently , the same method was applied to the description of electromagnetic dipole strength in @xmath2o @xcite .",
    "a systematic study sheds light on the sensitivity of the electromagnetic strength distribution to the interaction in the continuum .",
    "we expose the dependence on the binding energy of the nucleon and on the angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "our approach extends the familiar textbook case of the deuteron , that can be considered as the prime example of a halo nucleus , to arbitrary nucleon+core systems , see also @xcite .",
    "we also investigate in detail the square - well potential model .",
    "it has great merits : it can be solved analytically , it shows the main characteristic features and it leads to rather simple and transparent formulae . as far as we know , some of these formulae have not been published before .",
    "these explicit results can be compared to our general theory for low energies ( effective - range approach ) and also to more realistic woods - saxon models . due to shape independence",
    ", the results of these various approaches will not differ for low energies .",
    "it will be interesting to delineate the range of validity of the simple models .",
    "our effective - range approach is closely related to effective field theories that are nowadays used for the description of the nucleon - nucleon system and halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "the characteristic low - energy parameters are linked to qcd in systematic expansions .",
    "similar methods are also used in the study of exotic atoms ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ,  ) in terms of effective - range parameters .",
    "the close relation of effective field theory to the effective - range approach for hadronic atoms was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the anc method",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the radial continuum wave function @xmath6is a pure coulomb wave function ( a regular spherical bessel function for neutrons ) and that the dominant contribution to the radial integral @xmath7 comes from the region @xmath8 where r is the range of the nuclear interaction . in this case",
    "the s - factor is entirely determined by the asymptotic normalization constant ( anc ) @xmath9 of the bound state wave function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the anc is determined by a suitable transfer reaction . in some cases",
    "this is a good approximation . in general",
    "there is an influence from the final state interaction on the final continuum wave function . in the outside region",

    "[ fig:1 ] we show the application of the method to the electromagnetic dipole strength in @xmath0be .",

    "the anc can be converted to a spectroscopic factor of @xmath22 that is consistent with results from other methods . in the lowest order of the effective - range expansion",
    "the phase shift in the partial wave with orbital angular momentum @xmath23 and total angular momentum @xmath24 is written as @xmath25 .",
    "the halo expansion parameter is denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the neutron separation energy is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the effective range term @xmath29 term can be neglected , since it leads to a contribution with an extra @xmath30 factor which is small in the halo nucleus limit @xmath31 ( at least in the case where the scattering length and the effective range parameter are of natural order ) .",

    "the connection of the scattering length @xmath39 and the bound state parameter q for @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 in a square well model with radius r. this is a generalization of the well - known relation @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 channel in @xmath0be is an example for the influence of a halo state on the continuum .",

    "while single particle halos show rather simple features which can largely be explained in the frame of the one - body schrdinger equation , two neutron ( or two proton , or neutron - proton ) halo nuclei show many more interesting aspects .",
    "a borromean nucleus is a three - body system which falls apart when one of the particles is removed , @xmath0li is an example .",
    "it can be considered as a bound system of two neutrons and a core ( @xmath52li ) .",
    "the system is barely bound ( @xmath53kev ) and the core can be assumed to be inert . the subsystems ( n - n ) and ( @xmath52li - n ) are unbound .",
    "the binding of the borromean nucleus is due to the attractive n - n interaction which leads to the binding of the three - body system , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "essentially due to the small binding energy the low - lying e1 strength shows simple universal features as we will show now .",
    "the system is probed by long wavelength photons and can be characterized by a few low energy constants . as we have seen in the previous subsection , the dipole matrixelement is dominated by contributions from distances larger than the range of the core - neutron interaction . in this region",
    "the wave function depends on the binding energy @xmath54 . in",
    "a mean field approach the binding energy is shared equally between the two neutrons .",

    "it is given in terms of the jacobi coordinates @xmath67 and @xmath68 by @xmath69 the introduction of the jacobi coordinates introduces an asymmetry between the two identical neutrons .",
    "this translates into an asymmetry of the effective charges for both neutrons , we neglect this effect , which is of the order of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mass of the core . for the effective charge",
    "we take @xmath72 .",
    "( the other possible choice would be @xmath73 . )",
    "the final state is given by two continuum neutrons with momenta @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we assume that they are uncorrelated .",
    "low lying strength is a long wavelength phenomenon , and the interaction can be characterized by the n - core scattering lengths @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the @xmath43 and @xmath48 channels .",
    "we know that @xmath78li is unbound , so these scattering lengths are negative .",
    "the continuum radial wave functions are given by a product of single particle wave functions of the type given by eq .",

    "the dipole matrix element consists of a product of two terms : one is characterized by the dipole selection rule @xmath79 and is of the type encountered in the single particle case above .",
    "we have @xmath80 where the shape functions @xcite are given in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath81 by @xmath82 for s to p - transitions and by @xmath83 for p - to s - transitions .",
    "the other term is an overlap term @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( using the normalization conventions of @xcite ) .",
    "one can describe the physics of this matrixelement in quite simple terms : due to the sudden removal of one of the neutrons by the interaction of the photon with the core , the remaining neutron finds itself in the field of the @xmath52li core , where it is no longer bound .",
    "a shake off occurs , which is described by the overlap term , eq.9 .",
    "it is non - zero , because the two wave functions belong to different hamiltonians .",
    "a similar and familiar example is the shake - off of electrons after @xmath86-decay , where the nuclear charge is suddenly changed by one unit .",
    "this approach can also be applied to non - borromean nuclei . in this case the neutron can also be left in a bound state with a certain probability which can be obtained from the corresponding overlap matrixelement .",
    "the overlap integral is strongly peaked around zero energy . for",
    "@xmath43 one obtains @xmath87 in the unitary limit ( @xmath88 ) this reduces to @xmath89 this is probably a good approximation for the overlap term in the @xmath0li case where one neutron is almost bound to the @xmath52li core .",

    "is shown in fig.3 there",
    ". it will be interesting to compare this experimental result to the present approach .",
    "the dipole strength distribution @xmath92 depending on the relative energy e can be obtained by folding the dipole distribution with the overlap term : @xmath93 the factor of 2 arises because there are two neutrons in the same shell .",
    "we assume that the binding energy @xmath54 is known .",
    "the shapes of the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see eqs . 7 and 8) ( and @xmath96 ) show characteristic differences , so the fit to the experimental results @xcite will be quite sensitive to the spectroscopic factors @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the width of the nonorthogonality term depends on the scattering lengths , so they can also be determined by this 4-parameter fit , but probably one will be less sensitive to these quantities .",
    "the experimental results @xcite are quite well explained by the theory of esbensen and bertsch @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to compare the present approach also to the more detailed theory of @xcite . in the present approach",
    "only a few low energy parameters like the scattering lengths in the relevant channels enter .",
    "a similarity between cross sections for two - body and closely related three - body reactions under certain kinematical conditions @xcite led to the introduction of the trojan - horse method @xcite . in this indirect approach a two - body reaction @xmath99 that is relevant to nuclear astrophysics",
    "is replaced by a reaction @xmath100 with three particles in the final state .",
    "one assumes that the trojan horse @xmath101 is composed predominantly of clusters @xmath102 and @xmath103 , i.e.   @xmath104 .",
    "this reaction can be considered as a special case of a transfer reaction to the continuum .",
    "it is studied experimentally under quasi - free scattering conditions , i.e.  when the momentum transfer to the spectator @xmath103 is small .",
    "the method was primarily applied to the extraction of the low - energy cross section of reaction ( [ apreac ] ) that is relevant for astrophysics .",
    "however , the method can also be applied to the study of single - particle states in exotic nuclei around the particle threshold .      motivated by this we look again at the relation between transfer to bound and unbound states .",
    "we study the reaction @xmath105 where @xmath106 and b denotes the final @xmath107 system .",
    "it can be a bound state @xmath108 with binding energy @xmath109 , the open channel @xmath110 , or another channel @xmath111 of the system @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , the reaction @xmath112 can have a positive @xmath113 value and the energy @xmath114 can be negative as well as positive . as an example we quote the recently studied trojan horse reaction @xmath115+@xmath116li @xcite applied to the @xmath116li@xmath117he two - body reaction ( the neutron being the spectator ) .",
    "in this case there are two charged particles in the initial state ( @xmath116li+@xmath118 ) .",
    "another example with a neutral particle @xmath102 would be @xmath119be@xmath120be@xmath121 .",
    "the general question which we want to answer here is how the two regions @xmath122 and @xmath123 are related to each other .",
    "e.g. , in fig .  7 of @xcite",
    "the coincidence yield is plotted as a function of the @xmath116li-@xmath118 relative energy .",
    "it is nonzero at zero relative energy . how does the theory @xcite ( and the experiment ) continue to negative relative energies ? with this method , subthreshold resonances can be investigated rather directly .    the trojan horse amplitude f involves the combination @xmath124 ( see eq . ( 61 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "in this reference , only the case @xmath125 is dealt with explicitly .",
    "the threshold behaviour of @xmath126 in the case of neutrons is given by ( a.30 ) , for charged particles by eq .",
    "( 59 ) of @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath127 is the s - matrix - element connecting the channel @xmath128 and the elastic channel @xmath129 with angular momentum @xmath23 . for neutral particles",
    "the threshold behaviour is @xmath130 and the cross section @xmath131 tends to a finite constant .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for charged particles .",
    "let us now study the case @xmath123 and the transition from @xmath122 to @xmath123 . in the latter case",
    "the wave number k becomes complex , k@xmath132q and the factor @xmath126 involves a decaying function , instead of the oscillatory one . the quantity @xmath127 is no longer an s - matrixelement , it is the normalization factor for the decaying wave - function .",
    "the continuous transition for both cases was studied in @xcite in a two - channel model .",
    "an interesting case is when there are subthreshold resonances , like in the systems @xmath133 and in @xmath134 . in @xcite",
    "a two - channel model is studied.the standard breit - wigner result is obtained @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes the resonance energy , the partial widths are given by @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the total width is given by @xmath139 .    for @xmath140",
    "the width @xmath137 turns out to be imaginary @xcite .",
    "for @xmath141 we have a resonance , for @xmath142 a subthreshold resonance , the formulae are valid for both cases . in @xcite sub - coulomb @xmath143 transfer",
    "is used to study the low energy @xmath134 s - factor .",
    "transitions to the @xmath144 and @xmath145 bound states are observed and the reduced @xmath143 widths of these states is obtained .",
    "while the foundations of direct reaction theory have been laid several decades ago , the new possibilites which have opened up with the rare isotope beams are an invitation to revisit this field .",
    "the general frame is set by nonrelativistic many - body quantum scattering theory , however , the increasing level of precision demands a good understanding of relativistic effects notably in intermediate - energy coulomb excitation .",
    "the properties of halo nuclei depend very sensitively on the binding energy and despite the ever increasing precision of microscopic approaches using realistic nn forces it will not be possible , say , to predict the binding energies of nuclei to a level of about 100  kev .",
    "thus halo nuclei ask for new approaches in terms of some effective low - energy constants .",
    "such a treatment was provided in ch .  2 and an example with the one - neutron halo nucleus @xmath0be was given .",
    "with the future radioactive beam facilities at riken and gsi one will be able to study also neutron halo nuclei for intermediate masses in the years to come .",
    "this is expected to be relevant also for the astrophysical r - process .",
    "it is a great challenge to extend the present approach for one - nucleon halo nuclei to more complicated cases , like two - neutron halo nuclei . in the present work we obtained a rather simple formula for two - neutron halo nuclei with a transparent interpretation : after the first neutron is removed , the second one is left in a different field ( hamiltonian ) which leads to a shake - off process , similar to the rearrangement of the atomic cloud after an @xmath143- or @xmath86 decay .    while the coulomb dissociation method relies essentially only on qed",
    ", precise experiments can give , in combination with a thorough theoretical analysis , precise answers for the astrophysical s factors .",
    "in the trojan - horse method more phenomenological aspects enter , like optical model parameters and effective nuclear interactions .",
    "this makes the interpretation of the experimental results in terms of astrophysical s factors less precise . in the trojan - horse method",
    "one can extract bare nucleus ( unscreened ) s - factors , see e.g. @xcite . in the interpretation of screening effects",
    "one relies on the accuracy of the energy dependence .",
    "this is certainly better fulfilled than the accuracy of the absolute values .",
