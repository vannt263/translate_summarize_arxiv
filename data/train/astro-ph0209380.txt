    "how and when galaxies were formed and how they have evolved since , is one of the central issues of contemporary astrophysics today .",
    "elliptical galaxies may be the best objects to study galaxy evolution , since their optical light is not dominated by relatively recent star - formation , unlike that of spiral galaxies , and their observational properties are a better reflection of their long - timescale cosmological development .    in the 1980s",
    "it was shown that the main global properties of local elliptical galaxies , velocity dispersion , surface brightness and effective radius , are strongly correlated , and that they describe a plane in this 3-dimensional parameter space ( dressler et al . , 1987 ; djorgovski & davis , 1987 ) .",
    "initially , this ` fundamental plane ' ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies drew attention mainly for its use as a distant indicator , to measure the hubble constant and peculiar motions in the local universe .",
    "however , it was also realised that it implied a strong regularity in the process of galaxy formation , in particular that the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio varied only slightly over 4 orders of magnitude in galactic mass ( djorgovski & davis , 1987 ) .    since the m /",
    "l ratio is a strong function of the age of the stellar population , the study of the fundamental plane as function of redshift is a sensitive diagnostic of the evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "van dokkum , franx and kelson and collaborators , who observed elliptical cluster galaxies with the keck telescope and the hst , located at z=0.39 ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) , z=0.58 ( kelson et al .",
    "1997 ) , and z=0.83 ( van dokkum et al . 1998 ) , showed that the m / l ratio evolves as @xmath4 log @xmath5 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) , putting strong constraints on the formation epoch of cluster ellipticals , with @xmath8 for a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the mgb or mg@xmath9 indices are also valuable measures of the age of the stellar population , which is often used in conjunction with the fp .",
    "the mg@xmath9 index is found to be correlated with the central velocity dispersion in local elliptical galaxies , with only a small scatter ( eg .",
    "dressler et al . , 1987 ; djorgovski & davis , 1987 , jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 ) .",
    "ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) showed that for cluster galaxies at z=0.37 , this correlation is offset by @xmath10mgb@xmath11 @xmath12 which can be fully attributed to the lower luminosity - weighted ages of these stellar populations at this earlier epoch .",
    "these studies may seem to suggest that , except for perhaps some minor details , the evolution of elliptical galaxies is well understood",
    ". however , various strong biases may still be present in the studies described above",
    ". the most serious bias may be the progenitor bias ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) : present day ellipticals which were spirals at an earlier epoch , would not have been included in a sample at that epoch , biasing the sample to what are likely to be the oldest galaxies .",
    "furthermore , there is also an environmental bias : present studies are focused on cluster galaxies , while it is not known how these clusters evolve with cosmological epoch .",
    "for example , it is far from clear what a local cluster such as coma would have looked like at high redshift , and to what present - day structures the high - z clusters have evolved into . more generally , connecting populations at one redshift with their predecessor at high redshift , without making uncertain assumptions about the history of star formation is a problem .",
    "the place of active galaxies in the general picture of galaxy evolution is unclear . until recently ,",
    "agn were seen as rare and peculiar objects , which , although interesting for their own sake , were disconnected from galaxy evolution issues . however , the recent discovery that every galaxy seems to have a central massive black hole , the mass of which is closely related to the total mass of ( the bulges of ) its host ( magorrian et al , 1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , has changed this perception dramatically .",
    "it is now clear that the formation and evolution of the central massive black hole is closely linked to that of the host galaxy ( eg .",
    "silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , it implies that all galaxies may be capable of having phases of central activity , meaning that active galaxies are just normal galaxies , with their central black hole coincidently caught during a period of ( high ) accretion .",
    "this places active galaxies back in the centre of attention of galaxy formation and evolution studies , especially since they are relatively easy to select at high redshift .",
    "recent claims suggest that non - thermal radio emission from ellipticals is strongly correlated with the mass of their central black hole , ranging from dwarf ellipticals to powerful radio galaxies ( franceschini et al .",
    "this would make the connection between quiescent and active galaxies even stronger .",
    "since active galaxies play such a potentially important role in galaxy evolution , it is important to determine their fundamental structural parameters as function of redshift .",
    "an additional factor is that selection of agn allows the study of galaxy evolution independently of the optical selection biases as mentioned above .",
    "smith , heckman & illingworth ( 1990 ) have studied the fundamental plane parameters of nearby powerful radio galaxies , and showed that they indeed reside in normal ellipticals .",
    "a similar result has been found recently by bettoni et al .",
    "unfortunately , it is almost impossible to use similar objects at higher redshift , since their spectral energy distributions have invariably been found to be strongly influenced by agn light , especially in the optical ( eg . optical / uv alignment effect , mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 , chambers et al . 1987 ) .",
    "this problem can be avoided by selecting galaxies containing a very young radio source . in the very early stages of radio source evolution , when the radio source is only 100 - 1000 years old and confined to the central hundred parsecs , the contribution of the agn to the global properties of its host galaxy is still minimal ( snellen et al .",
    "1996a , b ; 1999 ) : broadband photometry showed that their optical to near - infrared colours are consistent with passively evolving ellipticals , indicating that their light is dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "the dispersion in their @xmath13 and @xmath14 band hubble diagrams ( 0.3 mags ) is smaller than that for other classes of radio galaxies , indicating a homogeneous and well behaved population of hosts ( snellen et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "in addition , their optical spectra typically only show weak emission lines but deep stellar absorption lines , again indicative of them being dominated by old stellar populations ( snellen et al .",
    "for example , the archetype young radio source , b0108 + 388 , is as powerful as cygnus a. however , it has a remarkably low oiii@xmath15 equivalent width of only @xmath164@xmath17(lawrence et al .",
    "1996 ) , corresponding to a line luminosity about a factor 50 lower than that of cygnus a.    that the contamination from young radio - loud agn is only small or even absent may not come as a surprise .",
    "the young radio source may not yet have pierced through the dense and dusty central regions of the host .",
    "agn related light is also likely to still be confined to the inner hundreds of light years , and obscured from our view .",
    "there is indeed much evidence through hi absorption studies of young radio - loud agn that large column densities of gas are present ( eg .",
    "carilli et al .",
    "1999 ; peck , taylor & conway 1999 )    in this paper , we investigate the use of the host galaxies of young radio - loud agn as probes of galaxy evolution . the connection between radio activity and black hole mass , as infered from their central velocity dispersion , has also been investigated .",
    "we present high dispersion spectroscopic and optical ccd imaging data of a sample of 7 young radio - loud agn located between @xmath0 .",
    "section 2 describes the properties of young radio - loud agn and the selection of the sample .",
    "section 3 describes the observations , reduction and analysis .",
    "section 4 and 5 present the results and discussion . for consistency with previous papers on this subject",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath18=50 km sec@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20=1.0 , @xmath21=0 , throughout this paper , unless stated otherwise .",
    "in the course of the last decade , a class of extragalactic radio source has been identified as being very young .",
    "this has opened many unique opportunities for radio source evolution studies .",
    "unfortunately , the nomenclature and use of acronyms in this field of research is rather confusing .",
    "this is mainly caused by the different ways in which young radio - loud agn are selected .",
    "selections of young sources are made in two ways , the first based on their broadband radio spectra , and the second based on their compact morphology .",
    "a convex shaped spectrum , peaking at about 1 ghz distinguishes young radio sources from other classes of compact radio sources . in this case",
    "they are called gigahertz peaked spectrum ( * gps * ) radio sources ( eg . odea et al .",
    "1991 , odea 1998 ) .",
    "similar objects , which are typically an order of magnitude larger in size , have their spectral turnovers shifted to the @xmath22 mhz regime , causing them to be dominated at cm wavelengths by the optically thin parts of their spectra .",
    "these are called compact steep spectrum ( * css * ) radio sources to distinguish them from the general population of extended steep spectrum sources ( eg .",
    "fanti et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "on the other hand , young radio sources are found in multi - frequency vlbi surveys , in which they can be recognised by compact jet / lobe - like structures on both sides of their central core .",
    "they are called compact symmetric objects ( * cso * , wilkinson et al .",
    "their double sided structures clearly distinguish them from the large majority of compact sources showing one - sided core - jet morphologies .",
    "larger versions of csos are subsequently called medium symmetric objects ( * mso * ) and large symmetric objects ( * lso * ) .",
    "the overlap between the classes of cso and gps galaxies is large and we believe that they can be considered to be identical objects .",
    "however , a substantial fraction of gps sources are optically identified with high redshift quasars , which in general show core - jet structures ( stanghellini et al .",
    "the relationship between gps quasars and gps / cso galaxies is not clear ( snellen et al .",
    "1998b ) , and the former may not be young objects et all .",
    "although it was always speculated that gps sources were young objects , only recently has strong evidence been found to support this hypothesis .",
    "monitoring several prototype gps / cso sources over a decade or more using vlbi , allowed owsianik & conway ( 1998 ) and owsianik , conway & polatidis ( 1998 ) to measure their hotspot advance speeds to be @xmath23 .",
    "these imply dynamical ages of typically @xmath24 years .",
    "similar studies with similar results have now also been conducted by tschager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and taylor et al .",
    "additional proof for youth comes from analysis of the overall radio spectra of the somewhat larger css sources .",
    "murgia et al ( 1999 ) show that their spectra can be fitted with synchrotron ageing models , implying ages of typically @xmath25 years .",
    "the work of these authors indicate that gps / cso sources are very young and the likely progenitors of large , extended radio sources .",
    "however , there may also be a population of young radio - loud agn which are just short - lived , and do not evolve into large size radio sources ( readhead et al .",
    "1994 ; alexander 2000 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the connection of these host galaxies with those of other types of agn would be less clear .",
    "the sample of young radio sources used in this paper is based on the sample of bright gps sources of stanghellini et al .",
    "this complete sample of 33 objects contains sources with turnover frequencies between 0.4 and 6 ghz , with @xmath26 jy , and are located at @xmath27 and galactic latitude @xmath28 . of this sample ,",
    "19 are optically identified with galaxies , of which 6 are found at @xmath29 .",
    "two objects , b1345 + 125 and b1404 + 286 , were omitted from the sample , since these were known to exhibit broad seyfert - type emission lines in their optical spectra , implying a strong contribution of agn related light .",
    "we further excluded b0428 + 205 due to its low galactic latitude and high foreground extinction .    to enlarge the usable sample and to be able to investigate possible correlations between host galaxy properties or optical agn contribution and radio power , we included nearby gps galaxies from the sample of snellen et al ( 1995 ) at intermediate flux densities , and from snellen et al .",
    "( 1998a ) at faint flux densities .",
    "this involved the only gps galaxy at low redshift from the intermediate sample , b1144 + 3517 , and two nearby galaxies from the faint gps sample , b0830 + 5813 and b1946 + 7048 .",

    "the mgb deficit in b0941 - 0805 can be explained by an agn continuum contribution of 35% . for the other galaxies in the sample",
    "the agn contribution is less than @xmath105 - 10% .",

    "the work by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and ferrarese & merrit ( 2000 ) have shown that the mass of a central black hole is strongly correlated with the central velocity dispersion of its host galaxy . according to gebhardt",
    "the relation follows @xmath64 which is found to have a lower dispersion than the correlation with absolute ( bulge ) magnitude .",
    "this @xmath3 relation allows us to infer black hole masses from the central velocity dispersion measurements , for the galaxies in our sample , and those in smith et al . and",
    "faber et al .",
    "uncertainties in the black holes masses are dominated by the scatter in the @xmath3 relation , which is estimated to be a factor of @xmath162 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a variety of authors have discussed the relation between @xmath1 and radio power .",
    "long before the correlations between black hole mass and central velocity dispersion or galactic bulge mass were established , evidence has been provided of a relation between galactic bulge luminosity and/or velocity dispersion with radio luminosity @xmath65 ( heckman 1983 , nelson & whittle 1996 ) .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that for a small sample of nearby galaxies , the non - thermal radio emission is strongly correlated with the black hole mass , from the dwarf elliptical m32 to the powerful radio galaxy m87 , with a surprisingly small scatter , which was confirmed by mclure et al .",
    "more recently , other studies ( eg . laor 2000 ; ho 2002 ) show that agn are in general located above the overall @xmath66 relation as found by franceschini et al .",
    "interestingly , dunlop and mclure and collaborators ( dunlop et al . 2002 ; dunlop & mclure 2002 ) have suggested that there is an @xmath1-dependent lower and upper limit to the possible radio output of a black hole , offsetted from each other over several orders of magnitude .    to investigate these issues further , and in particular the relative position of radio galaxies on the @xmath66 relation , we correlated the galaxies from faber et al . with the nvss - vla 1.4 ghz survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and determined their radio luminosities and sizes .",
    "the @xmath66 relation for the galaxies in the faber et al .",
    "( circles ) , and the radio selected galaxies from smith et al . and",
    "this paper ( squares ) are shown in figure [ mbhradio ] .",
    "the galaxies in faber et al .",
    "which exhibit extended radio structure , and therefore clearly identified as active galaxies , are indicated by solid circles .",
    "a few objects from the local group are added , and are indicated by diamonds .",
    "to avoid the diagram being crowded by meaningless upperlimits , only those objects are plotted , if their radio flux would have been detectable in the nvss if they radiate at a luminosity expected from the franceschini relation .",
    "although this produces a varying redshift cut - off with black hole mass , it does not bias the result towards particular radio luminosities .",
    "clearly , the radio luminosities of the presumably inactive galaxies correlate well with black hole mass , although they seem to be slightly fainter than expected from the franceschini relation , and have a larger scatter , with the radio power of inactive galaxies at a given black hole mass ranging more than 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the active galaxies ( those selected in the radio , and those selected from the faber et al . sample exhibiting extended nvss emission ) , do not show any sign of a correlation with black hole mass . at a given @xmath1",
    "the radio luminosity can span over 7 orders of magnitude , making radio power unsuitable as a black hole mass estimator .",
    "we note that the black hole masses for radio galaxies as derived by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are on average about a factor of 4 higher than given here ( assuming @xmath1=0.0013@xmath67 ) .",
    "this is caused by their different method used to determine @xmath1 , based on the bulge luminosity @xmath35 bulge mass @xmath35 black hole mass relation : the average absolute r - band magnitude for the smith et al .",
    "sample ( @xmath68 , assuming v - r=0.6 ) is the same as that for the radio galaxies in the dunlop et al .",
    "sample ( @xmath69 ) , indicating that the properties of the host galaxies in the two samples are the same .",
    "note that the differences between these methods result mainly in an uncertainty in the absolute values of @xmath1 , not in their relative values .",
    "all the radio galaxies are within the allowed range of radio power for their black hole masses as proposed by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "since the radio galaxies are selected virtually independently of their optical properties , and the optically selected galaxies independently of their radio properties , the samples can be used to connect the two populations .",
    "figure [ mbhradio ] shows that there is a clear difference between the @xmath1 distribution for radio selected and optically selected agn , with those selected in the radio , being biased towards lower black hole masses .",
    "we believe this is the natural consequence of the faber et al .",
    "sample strongly favouring intrinsically more luminous galaxies , caused by its apparent magnitude limit .",
    "in contrast , the selection of objects on radio emission is practically volume based , with the parent population of potential radio - loud agn containing relatively many more galaxies with lower velocity dispersions and black hole masses than the faber et al .",
    "sample , which causes the sample of radio - selected agns to cover more galaxies with low @xmath1 .",
    "these black hole mass distributions form the key to understand the connection between the populations of radio - loud and radio - quiet galaxies .",
    "first we determined the fraction of radio - loud agn in the faber et al .",
    "sample as a function of black hole mass .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fraction ] , with the solid and dotted lines indicating the fraction of galaxies with @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 w / hz respectively , the former decreasing from about 1/5 at @xmath73 to @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "note that a different subsample has been used for this than in figure [ mbhradio ] , with such a distance limit that it can be determined from the nvss whether the galaxy has a radio power above or below the cut - off .",
    "the dashed line shows the fraction of objects as function of @xmath1 with a radio power more than 100 times that expected for the @xmath76 relation by franceschini et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "it shows that although the radio selected agn do not have black holes with m@xmath77 , black holes below this mass can still be active but only with a very low probability .",
    "several objects with @xmath78 have been found with extended double - lobed low power radio sources in the faber et al .",
    "sample .    with this estimate of the fraction of black holes producing powerful radio sources as a function of @xmath1",
    ", the populations of radio - loud and radio - quiet galaxies can be linked .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a galaxy is connected to its central velocity dispersion by the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) , which in itself is related to the black hole mass via the @xmath3 relation . in this way",
    ", the local distribution of black hole masses can be roughly deduced from the local galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the combination of the faber - jackson relation , which was re - determined for @xmath2 from the galaxies in the faber et al .",
    "sample , and the @xmath79 relation , results in a local black hole mass distribution of @xmath80 with @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the schechter function parameters of the local luminosity function in b band .",
    "our estimate of the fraction of black holes producing powerful radio sources should now link this distribution of @xmath1 to the local _ radio _ luminosity function . for our calculation",
    "we assume that the fraction of radio - loud black holes with @xmath85 w / hz is @xmath86 , which is represented by the smooth curve in figure [ fraction ] . using the schechter parameters for the local luminosity function of _ elliptical _ galaxies only , as derived from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( type 1 gals ; madgwick et al . , 2002 )",
    "we derive a local radio source density of @xmath87 mpc@xmath88 at log p@xmath89 w / hz . this corresponds very well to the density of radio sources above this luminosity cutoff as derived from the local radio luminosity function , which is @xmath90 mpc@xmath88 ( eg . dunlop & peacock , 1990 ) .",
    "in addition , the distribution of the black hole masses in the radio selected samples is shown in figure [ bh_dist ] .",
    "although these samples are not complete , we believe that they are roughly selected at random from the general population of radio sources with log p@xmath91 w / hz . the smooth curve represents the expected distribution of black hole masses from the calculations above , which is strikingly similar .",
    "these results confirm that elliptical galaxies must comprise the large majority of the radio - loud population of active galaxies .",
    "we have determined the fundamental galaxy parameters for a sample of 7 host galaxies of young radio - loud agn at z@xmath100.3 , and have shown that they follow the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies .",
    "there is some indication that the more distant objects in the sample have higher m / l ratios , as expected from stellar evolution .",
    "as these galaxies with young radio sources are relatively easy to select , and the contributions of the agn light to the optical spectra are minimal , they can readily be used to study the evolution of the fundamental plane out to z=1 , independent of optical selection effects .",
    "black hole masses are determined for the young radio - loud agn , and for samples of classical radio galaxies and optically selected ellipticals , using the @xmath3 relation .",
    "we confirm the relation between radio power and black hole mass as found by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but only for relatively passive ellipticals .",
    "active galaxies do not show such a correlation and can range over 7 orders of magnitude in radio power at a given @xmath1 .",
    "the local galaxy luminosity function was combined with the faber - jackson relation and the @xmath3 relation to obtain the local distribution of black hole masses .",
    "this , combined with the fraction of black holes with powerful radio sources as function of @xmath1 , which was determined from the optically selected sample , results in a radio source density and radio - loud black hole mass distribution . these are found to be consistent with the local radio luminosity function and the distribution of black hole masses in the radio - selected samples , and confirms that elliptical galaxies must comprise the large majority of the radio - loud population of active galaxies .",
