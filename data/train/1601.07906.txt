    "over the past twenty years or so the sample of astronomical objects known to emit the mid - infrared ( mir ) aromatic bands present from 320  has increased dramatically , and new discoveries regarding the inter - relations between the different bands have been revealed ( e.g. , , peeters et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the observed emission of the mir bands is now commonly associated with the vibrational relaxation of ultraviolet - pumped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , with several tools now available to interpret the mir bands in terms of pah emission ( e.g. , pahfit , @xcite ; the nasa ames pah database fitting routines , @xcite ; and pahtat , ) .",
    "the pah bands are observed in most astronomical contexts , particularly ones in which there is a significant uv radiation field ( e.g. , h  ii  regions , rne and planetary nebulae , ; galactic cirrus and dark cloud surfaces , ; external galaxies , @xcite ) leading to the conclusion that pah molecules are ubiquitous in the universe .",
    "some of the strongest pah emission spectra are observed around h  ii  regions , where the region immediately beyond the ionized region ( often called a photodissociation region or pdr ; e.g. , @xcite ) has the right conditions for the existence and excitation of the molecules .",
    "many studies have examined the appearance of the pah bands in these environments , however there have only been a few which have done this in a spatially resolved way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ability to examine pah emission in a spatially resolved observation has become very important in developing the pah model because the emission from the pah molecules is sensitive to the physical conditions in which they reside and the variations seen therefore track changes in the local conditions .    in this paper , which will be the first of a series investigating aspects of the data presented here in detail , we describe the acquisition , reduction and measurement of _",
    "spitzer_/irs observations for a sample of observed h  ii  regions , as well as several famous rne for comparison .",
    "our analysis will focus on their mir emission characteristics , particularly the aromatic bands at 6.2 ,  7.7 \" , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7 .",
    "the remainder of this paper will be organized as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] we will discuss all aspects of our data , from the targets themselves , to the observational properties and data reduction .",
    "section  [ sec : ma ] contains a detailed description of all our measurement and analysis techniques , and section  [ sec : res ] describes our results .",
    "finally , sections  [ sec : disc ] and [ sec : cs ] provide some brief discussion of our results and then a summary of our conclusions .",

    "@xcite presented observations of both sources using msx observations at a scale of around @xmath020 , which revealed that the structure of the emission for g11.94 did not mirror the radio emission ( which traces the ionized region ) , while for g37.55 the core - halo radio morphology was not contradicted by the ` extended ' appearance in the mir . for g11.94 this conclusion was confirmed by @xcite who presented much higher resolution images taken at ground based facilities .",
    "their 20.8  image clearly shows that there is a very strong peak in the emission close to the south edge of the cometary halo observed in the radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) with some extended emission to the north going well beyond the radio emission .",
    "in addition there appears to be a secondary peak in the mir emission on the northern edge of the radio halo .",

    "subsequently the sl1 and sl2 cubes were stitched together using the derived scaling factors . for each of our maps",
    "the scale factors between orders were around 10% , with outliers being investigated and in some cases flagged as poor data .",
    "as the irs / sl pixels are around half the size of the beam , the final cubes were created by averaging 2@xmath42 pixel apertures , resulting in overlapping extraction apertures in which one in every four pixels is independent .",
    "this was performed by taking the average of the next three adjacent pixels , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the resulting cube and @xmath12 is the observed cube .",

    "subsequent analysis masked out the non independent pixels .",
    "while several of the maps were not nyquist sampled , we adopted the same procedure such that we produced a uniform sample of spectral maps .",
    "the analysis of the spectra took place in several stages .",
    "firstly , we measured and corrected for extinction ( as will be described in section  [ sec : ex ] ) . secondly , we defined the continua and aromatic emission plateaus using spline fits .",
    "thirdly , we fit the continuum subtracted emission features in a variety of ways , from direct integration for some pah bands , to gaussian fits for the emission lines . in general this combination of techniques is referred to as the ` spline ' method ( e.g. , ) .",
    "other methods of fitting the pah spectra involve fitting an array of drude profiles to model the pah emission ( e.g. , pahfit ; @xcite ) , or using templates based on principle component analysis ( e.g. , pahtat ; ) .",
    "it has been shown though that the trends present in the pah band intensity measurements do not depend on the measuring technique employed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and so we are confident that our use of the spline method does not introduce any significant biases .    before processing the data for each cube though , regions of poor data or contamination from unwanted sources were masked out .",
    "primarily this meant removing the pixels associated with young stellar objects ( yso s ) in m  17 and ngc  2023 ( visible as bright sources towards the middle of the ngc  2023 south cube and in the middle of the m  17 cube ) .",
    "in addition we removed sections of cubes which had fallen ` off - source ' , i.e. , pixels which did not contain significant flux  such as the southern half of the ngc  2023 south cube , and the northern and southern 20% of the ngc  1333 cube .",
    "in general , molecular clouds and h  ii  regions contain copious amounts of dust , which combine to create both continuous extinction from the uv to the mid - infrared ( although this is generally a small effect in the mir ) as well as strong absorption features associated with dust grains of specific compositions .",
    "the most important of these , from the point of view of measuring pah band fluxes , is the silicate feature at 9.8 .",
    "this feature has significant width which overlaps two important pah bands at 8.6 and 11.2 .",
    "typically the 11.2  band is used to normalize measurements of the other bands , so its obscuration can strongly effect the interpretation of the pah spectrum .    in order to correct our band measurements",
    "we adopt the ` modified spoon method ' from @xcite which is an updated version of the method used by @xcite which includes the silicate absorption profile given by @xcite .",
    "this procedure relies on the 5 - 15  continuum displaying a strong rising power law towards the red , which is appropriate for the h  ii  regions .",
    "however , the rne do not generally display spectra with rising power law continua , instead they seem to have roughly linear continua in physical ( i.e. w m@xmath13 @xmath14 vs. ) units .",
    "therefore for the rne we have used a modified version of our extinction measurement routine in which we assume a linear continuum between 5 and 15 .",

    "@xcite attributed the observed bifurcation to changes in the 11.2  complex profile , specifically the appearance of extra emission appearing redward of 11.3 which they refer to as the ` red wing ' . in general , this split is evident for all of the relationships between ionized pah bands ( at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 12.7 ) and the neutral band at 11.2 , albeit very weakly for 12.7 vs. 11.2 .",

    "it can be seen that the horsehead points seem to adopt a slightly steeper gradient than the pdr line , perhaps suggesting that the pah molecules in the horsehead nebula possess an ionization fraction even lower than the 0.4 found for the pdr correlation .",

    "the ngc  1333 , 2023 points ( grouped together as ` rne ' ) also follow the ` pdr ' component , albeit with a distinct bulge towards the ` diffuse ' component seen in the ngc  7023 points . in some cases , this bulge overlaps with the diffuse trend ( particularly when considering the 11.0  band ) . in terms of the @xcite interpretation of this diagram",
    ", this would imply that a subset of the rne points possess ionization fractions similar to that seen in ngc  7023 .",
    "finally , in the 11.2 vs. 12.7 plot , we see that the horsehead points actually follow the rne points much better than the h  ii  regions or m17 samples , contrary to what might be expected .",

    "this shape is effectively the same as that seen for the 11.2 vs. 11.0 correlation ( middle left panel of figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] ) , implying that either the 7.7 or 11.0  band measurement features a neutral component .",
    "the most interesting result is that the slope of the trend in the 7.7 vs. 12.7 plot is different for each source , possibly reflecting the physical conditions .",
    "again , this suggests that the 12.7  pah band is comprised of emission from both neutral and ionized pah molecules .",
    "this idea has been suggested by several groups , particularly @xcite who showed that both ionized and neutral pahs with an ` armchair ' structure could contribute to emission at around 12.7 .",
    "subsequently @xcite found observational evidence of this effect in ngc  7023 , which we show here is a general behavior .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * the h  ii  regions behave differently from the rne .",
    "this was clearest when we consider the range of variations between the pah ratios ( figure  [ fig : rat_corr ] ) where for the 8.6/11.2 and 11.0/11.2 ratios the rne span a dynamic range twice that of the h  ii  regions .",
    "we note that our h  ii  region sample is systematically more distant than the rne sample and suspect that this compresses the dynamic range of the h  ii  region data by spatial dilution .",
    "* there are systematic differences between the slopes recovered for the different groups present in many of the found correlations .",
    "for example , even in the most well - known correlation 6.2/11.2 versus 7.7/11.2 , the h  ii  region and m  17 samples have steeper slopes than the rne . *",
    "the data suggests that the 11.0 and 12.7  bands may arise from a combination of neutral and ionized pah species .",
    "for the 12.7  band this effect is very clear in figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] , where the different groups have different slopes .",
    "* ngc  7023 has unique pah emission characteristics which seem to be driven by the weaker 11.2  band emission in the diffuse region ( around a factor of four weaker for a constant intensity of the 6  9  bands ) , which causes the traditional correlation plots to have extended ranges ( by at least a factor of two ) and the flux versus flux correlation plots to split into two branches ( labeled diffuse and pdr ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] we showed that the scaled flux correlations between most of the pah bands had a variety of shapes , ranging from linear to bifurcated .",
    "the bifurcated correlations belong exclusively to ngc  7023 , and this is likely due to its unique geometry with respect to our line of sight , producing a very sharp edge between two distinct pah emitting regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shapes seen in the scaled correlation plots for the other objects seemed to take two forms : linear , and linear plus an offset peak ( this pattern is clearest in the 11.2 vs. 11.0 panel of figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] , where the offset peak is centered around @xmath21 = 0.06 , @xmath22 = 0.5 for the rne ) . in the following discussion",
    "we follow the naming convention of @xcite and refer to the upper linear trend as the pdr material and the lower trend as the diffuse material . in these terms then , the linear component evident for most of the objects is very close to the ` pdr ' line defined by @xcite , although different sources seem to have slightly different slopes . while the second pattern consists of a section of the pdr line at lower intensity levels and an offset peak for the brighter regions",
    ". we can understand this pattern as being a mixture of environments along the line of sight , with the points within the offset peak being dominated ( although to what degree we can not say ) by ionized pah spectra from regions similar to the diffuse region seen for ngc  7023 , and the linear component dominated by colder material behind the pdr front ( i.e. experiencing a lower radiation field similar to the pdr regions of ngc  7023 ) .    this observation can help us understand the seemingly uniform nature of the h  ii  region scaled flux correlations , which seem to all fall into the category of ` linear ' correlations , i.e. dominated by emission from the pdr surrounding the h  ii  regions",
    ". however , if we assume that the much more distant h  ii  regions might possess environments similar to the ngc  7023 ` diffuse ' component , then one may expect slight curvature in the linear correlations because the pixels containing the diffuse component would be diluted with normal ` pdr ' material to a greater extent  with the overall effect being a slight shift rather than forming a separate peak . in this case",
    "the pdr material is still the major component of the spectrum .",
    "we can test this idea immediately by examining figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] for evidence of curvature in the ` linear ' trends , with the expectation that the curvature would increase ( i.e. move towards the combination of pdr and diffuse components seen for the rne ) for the closer objects with pixels covering smaller spatial areas ( see table  [ tables : objects ] for the area of 1 irs / sl pixel in square parsecs for each object ) .",
    "this trend is evident if we compare the h  ii  region sample ( generally very distant , dominated by w49a points at distance @xmath510 kpc ) and m17 ( almost a factor of ten closer ) in figure  [ fig : lm_corr_all ] , indeed the m17 trend is curved towards the rne points ( this is especially evident in the top row where 11.2  band is plotted vs. 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6  band measurements ) .",
    "interestingly , the horsehead points match this pattern for the 6.2gs and 7.7gs bands vs. the 11.2  band scaled flux correlation , but not the 8.6gs vs. 11.2  scaled flux correlation .",
    "we show this effect in figure  [ fig : curvehii ] , in which we replicate the rne contours of the 11.2 vs. 8.6  scaled band intensity correlation plot and show best fits for the h  ii  regions and m  17 data using both straight line and polynomial ( @xmath27 ) models taking into account both @xmath21 and @xmath22 uncertainties calculated from the signal - to - noise ratios . for the h",
    "ii  regions sample the curved fit follows the straight line almost exactly showing that there is almost no curvature , conversely for m17 a significant deviation from the straight line towards the secondary rne peak is seen ( with an accompanying increase in reduced @xmath28 ) .",
    "there is a significant amount of scatter around these trends , which shows that even in pixels which have similar dispositions of environments along the line of sight , there can be significant changes in flux .",
    "simple models like our polynomial fit , can not capture these changes ( in fact , the scatter for the horsehead points forces the best fitting curve model to turn over entirely ) .",
    "however our model does seem to capture the small changes present in more distant objects like m  17 .",
    "for the h  ii  regions , that are around a factor of ten more distant than m  17 , the diffuse component can not be detected in this way , as if it is present , its emission is overwhelmed by the pdr - like material dominating the beam .",
    "earlier we commented that the horsehead pdr points do not seem to follow the expected pattern of curvature despite being nearby , where it would be expected that the increased spatial resolution would yield a clearer detection of any diffuse component .",
    "the likely reason for this is , again , the size of the beam used to make our map , but in the opposite sense from the other h  ii  regions  the horsehead region is so large on the sky that the diffuse region is not present in our map ! show irs / sl spectra for a selection of positions between the ic  434 / horsehead pdr interface and the ionizing star ( their figure 4 ) , in which they show that the spectrum of their region 6 , several arcminutes outside of our map , seems to have a pah spectrum reminiscent of that seen for the ` diffuse ' emission from ngc  7023 .",
    "we have seen that the observed pah band intensity ratios can be attributed mainly to changes in the overall ionization state of the emitting pah molecules within the beam of each observation .",
    "these feature ratios should therefore be related to the physical conditions  in which the pah molecules find themselves .",
    "empirical calibrations between the band ratios and physical conditions have been attempted several times ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these three studies took very different approaches though , with @xcite estimating the physical conditions in their sample based on other information ( e.g. , spectral types and geometry ) ; @xcite using only well studied sources for which the physical conditions were known beforehand ; and @xcite using observations to calibrate the ionization fractions found using nasa ames pah database @xcite with @xmath29 , using only the pah spectra .",
    "we adopted a mixture of the first two approaches , using literature values where present , and estimating other parameters using simple relationships between , for example , the stellar spectral types , g@xmath30 , and continuum radio emission measurements and the nebular n@xmath31 .",
    "given the very different strategy employed by @xcite to compute physical conditions , we present their results as a point of comparison as we would not necessarily expect their methodology to produce the same results as those presented here or those by @xcite .",
    "firstly , we restrict our sample to those sources where we believe that a simple estimate is physically meaningful , i.e. where we believe that the simple estimates of physical conditions correspond to the location of the dominant emitting pah population . in some cases",
    "this is relatively straightforward , as the geometry of the system is obvious .",
    "for example , the ic  434 / horsehead pdr front is at a known ( large ) distance from its exciting star and hence experiences no strong gradients in g@xmath30 .",
    "conversely , objects such as m  17 are very difficult to treat in a spatially resolved way , as although there exists a prescription for the varying of g@xmath30 throughout our field of view ( based on the spectral types and distances of the stars in the central cluster ; @xcite ) we do not have corresponding spatially resolved measurements of density or temperature . as such",
    ", we concentrate on including the geometrically simplest sources in our sample : the uc - h  ii  regions , including those measured as part of the w49a map : the ultra - compact h  ii  regions cc and dd ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the uc - h  ii  regions can be characterized using only radio observations of the free - free hydrogen emission continuum .",
    "such observations typically provide us with : a ) the stellar spectral type ; b ) the radius of the h  ii  region ; and c ) the hydrogen density of the h  ii  region . in order to convert these values into a measurement of the physical conditions in the pdr region , we employ the following relationships .",
    "firstly , the density of a pdr ( in terms of the number of hydrogen nuclei n@xmath32 , regardless of ionization or molecular state ) is about a factor of 30 higher than the electron density of the ionized region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can convert this n@xmath32 into the election density , n@xmath31 , of the pdr by assuming that the dominant source of electrons is the ionization of neutral carbon atoms , e.g. , that n@xmath31 @xmath33 ( c / h)n@xmath32 @xmath33 1.6 @xmath4 10@xmath34n@xmath32 if we assume galactic abundances . here",
    "we are explicitly following the method of @xcite , although this relationship is a fundamental part of the structure of pdrs .",
    "an average value for g@xmath30 can be calculated from the stellar spectral type if we know the radius of the pdr .",
    "this relationship is given by @xcite as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath37 is the fraction of far - uv photons and @xmath38 is the diameter of the h  ii  region . using the relationships provided by @xcite we can translate the stellar spectral type into the fuv luminosity @xmath39 , and thereby arrive at the results presented in table  [ tables : physconds ] for our uc - h  ii  regions .",
    "this process is performed routinely in order to calculate @xmath40 for pdrs ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the final parameter , t , only appears in its square root , and so , variations within the small range of temperatures physically plausible for pdrs , such as those studied here , only change @xmath29 by around 10% , with a typical temperature being around 400 k. therefore we adopted a value of 10% as the uncertainty of the calculated @xmath29 factors . for each source we calculated the 6.2/11.2 band intensity ratio by finding the average and standard deviations of the 6.2/11.2 band intensity ratios of all of the associated spectral pixels .",

    "while @xcite do not quote uncertainties on their measurements , it is clear from inspection of their imagery ( @xcite , figure 5a ) that the emission region is larger than the 0.5  radius implied by a 40% reduction in size .",

    "this observation leaves us with two options : either the physical conditions in ngc  7023 are far more extreme than predicted by @xcite ; or that the relationships between the pah ratios and physical conditions are more complex than that expressed by @xmath29 .",
    "given that other sources in our sample , noticeably the horsehead pdr with its extremely low radiation field strength , do not fall on the @xcite trend , it seems that the second scenario is the most likely .",
    "we have reduced and analyzed a large sample of _ spitzer_-irs sl spectral cubes of h  ii  regions and rne , primarily in terms of their pah emission .",
    "each spectral pixel of each cube was processed using the same spline method with the same parameters , creating a uniform sample of measurements of the pah bands and the other emission features between 5 - 15 .",
    "several of these cubes have been investigated before ( e.g. , w49a , ngc  2023 , ngc  7023 ) and these datasets were used as a framework to understand the results for the other objects .",
    "we then attempted to understand the flux / flux correlation plots in terms of the average environment along the line of sight and showed that the observed shapes in the correlation plots represent different mixtures of diffuse and pdr environments .",
    "finally we investigated the relationship between the observed pah band ratios and the physical environments of our sources .",
    "our main findings are :    1 .",
    "the pah emission from h  ii  regions is distinct from that of rne in terms of the relationships between the band strengths",
    "we find that following general groups seem to have very similar pah properties  the h  ii  regions ( w49a , g11.94 - 0.62 , g37.55 - 0.11 and iras  12063 - 6259 ) , the rne ( ngc  1333 , ngc  2023 )  and that some sources do not fall into either of these categories ( ngc  7023 , the horsehead pdr and m17 ) .",
    "traditional correlation plots reveal that the rne have a greater dynamic range for the pah band ratios than h ii - regions .",
    "in particular ngc  7023 which , due to the noted sharp divide between environments , has a strong reduction in 11.2  band emission across approximately half of the map . for the other rne the variations are still only around half of those seen for ngc  7023 .",
    "this effect may be due to the fact that the h  ii  regions are systematically more distant than the rne and , as such , the contents of each h  ii  region spectrum consist of the average of a wider variety of environments , especially as the physical area encompassed in each pixel increases .",
    "4 .   both the traditional , and the flux versus flux correlation plots reveal that the 11.0 and 12.7  bands behave differently from the other pah bands , in a manner consistent with being generated by a mixture of both neutral and ionized pah species",
    "the split seen between a ` diffuse ' and a ` pdr ' component observed by @xcite in flux versus flux correlation plots is only seen strongly for ngc  7023 , although the nearby h  ii  regions give hints that there may be some diffuse component contribution to their spectra .",
    "the presence of a subtle diffuse component can be deduced in some sources by examining the curvature in the distribution of data points for the flux versus flux correlations between a primarily ionized band and a primarily neutral band , e.g. , the 11.2  band versus the 8.6  band . 7 .",
    "our uc - h  ii  region sample is consistent with the @xcite relationship between physical conditions and pah ratios , however they are inconsistent with the @xcite relationship found in a spatially resolved study of ngc  7023 .",
    "this seems to indicate that there may not be one simple relationship between all of the physical conditions ( density , temperature and radiation field intensity ) and the pah band ratios .",
