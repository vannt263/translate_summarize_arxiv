    "as crs are mostly charged nuclei , their paths are deflected and highly isotropized by the action of galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) they propagate through before reaching the earth atmosphere .",
    "the gmf is the superposition of regular field lines and chaotic contributions and the local total intensity is supposed to be @xmath0 @xcite . in such a field , the gyro - radius of crs is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is in astronomic units and r@xmath3 is the rigidity in teravolt .",
    "clearly , there is very little chance of observing a point - like signal from any radiation source below @xmath4 , as they are known to be at least several hundreds parsecs away .",
    "if it is true that magnetic fields are the most important `` isotropizing '' factor when they randomly vary on short distances , it is clear as much that some particular features of the magnetic field at the boundary of the solar system or farther might focus crs along certain lines and the observed arrival direction distribution turns out to be consequently an - isotropic .",
    "different experiments observed an energy - dependent _ `` large scale '' _ anisotropy with amplitude spanning 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 , from tens gev to hundreds tev , suggesting the existence of two distinct broad regions , an excess named _",
    "`` tail - in '' _ ( distributed around 40@xmath7 to 90@xmath7 in right ascension ( r.a . ) and a deficit named _",
    "`` loss cone '' _",
    "( distributed around 150@xmath7 to 240@xmath7 in r.a . ) .    moreover , in the last decade smaller excesses ( @xmath8 wide ) were found to exist in the cr arrival direction distribution .",
    "the origin of the galactic cr anisotropy is still unknown , but the study of its evolution over the energy spectrum has an important valence to understand the propagation mechanisms and the structure of the magnetic fields through which crs have traveled .",
    "in 2006 the tibet as@xmath9 experiment , located at yangbajing ( 4300 m a.s.l . ) , published the first 2d high - precision measurement of the cr anisotropy in the northern hemisphere in the energy range from few to several hundred tev @xcite . in the figure [ fig : tibet_model ] the cr intensity map observed by tibet as@xmath9 is shown ( panel ( a ) ) , together with some theoretical model .",
    "the tibet as@xmath9 collaboration carried out the first measurement of the energy and declination dependences of the r.a .",
    "profiles in the multi - tev region with a single eas array , revealing finer details of the known anisotropy .",
    "they found that the first harmonic amplitude is remarkably energy - independent in the range 4 - 53 tev and all the components of the anisotropy fade out for cr energy higher than a few hundred tev , showing a co - rotation of galactic crs with the local galactic magnetic environment .",
    "the milagro collaboration published in 2009 a 2d display of the sidereal anisotropy projections in r.a . at a primary cr energy of about 6 tev @xcite .",
    "they observed a steady increase in the magnitude of the signal over seven years , in disagreement with the tibet as@xmath9 results @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the energy at which the tibet as@xmath9 and milagro results were obtained ( @xmath10 10 tev ) is too high for sun effects play an important role .    in 2007 , modeling the large scale anisotropy of 5 tev cr , the tibet - as@xmath9 collaboration ran into a `` skewed '' feature over - imposed to the broad structure of the so - called tail - in region @xcite .",
    "they modeled it with a couple of intensity excesses in the hydrogen deflection plane @xcite , each of them 10@xmath7 - 30@xmath7 wide .",
    "a residual excess remained in coincidence with the helio - tail .",
    "see the figure [ fig : tibet_model ] ( d ) and its caption for more details .",
    "experiment @xcite .",
    "( a ) : the observed cr intensity ; ( b ) : the best - fit large scale component ; ( c ) : the significance map of the residual anisotropy after subtracting the large scale component ; ( d ) : the best - fit medium scale component ; ( e ) : the best - fit large+medium scale components ; ( f ) : the significance map of the residual anisotropy after subtracting the large and the medium scale component .",
    "the solid black curves represent the galactic plane .",
    "the dashed black curves represent the hydrogen deflection plane .",
    "the helio - tail direction is indicated by the black filled circle .",
    "the open cross and the inverted star with the attached characters `` f '' and `` h '' represent possible orientations of the local interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the open triangle with `` b '' indicates the orientation of the best - fit bi - directional cosmic - ray flow obtained in the reference @xcite .",
    "[ fig : tibet_model ] ]    afterwards the milagro collaboration claimed the discovery of two localized regions of excess 10 tev crs on angular scales of 10@xmath7 with greater than 12 @xmath11 significance @xcite .",
    "the figure [ fig : milagro2008 ] reports the pre - trial significance map of the observation .",
    "regions `` a '' and `` b '' , as they were named , are positionally consistent with the `` skewed feature '' observed by tibet - as@xmath9 .",
    "the strongest and most localized of them ( with an angular size of about 10@xmath7 ) coincides with the direction of the helio - tail .",
    "the fractional excess of region a is @xmath1210@xmath5 , while for region b it is @xmath10 4@xmath13 10@xmath5 .",
    "the deep deficits bordering the excesses are due to a bias in the reference flux calculation .",
    "this effect slightly underestimates the significance of the detection .",
    "the milagro collaboration excluded the hypothesis of gamma - ray induced excesses .",
    "in addition , they showed the excess over the large scale feature without any data handling ( see the figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "bin was used to smooth the data , and the color scale gives the statistical significance .",
    "the solid line marks the galactic plane , and every 10@xmath7 in galactic latitude are shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the black dot marks the direction of the helio - tail , which is the direction opposite the motion of the solar system with respect to the local interstellar matter .",
    "[ fig : milagro2008 ] ]    the excesses in both regions are harder than the spectrum of the isotropic part of crs .",
    "easy to understand , more beamed the anisotropies and lower their energy , more difficult to fit the standard model of crs and galactic magnetic field to experimental results .",
    "in addition , the observation of a possible small angular scale anisotropy region contained inside a larger one rely on the capability for suppressing the smooth global cr anisotropy at larger scales without , at the same time , introducing effects of the analysis on smaller scales .",
    "nonetheless , this observation has been confirmed by the argo - ybj experiment@xcite at median energy of the isotropic cr proton flux of about e@xmath141.8 tev ( mode energy @xmath150.7 tev )",
    "some authors suggested that the large scale anisotropy can be explained within the diffusion approximation taking into account the role of the few most nearby and recent sources @xcite .",
    "other studies suggest that a non - di - polar anisotropy could be due to a combined effect of the regular and turbulent gmf @xcite , or to local uni- and bi - dimensional inflows @xcite .",
    "in particular the authors modeled the observed anisotropy by a superposition of a large , global anisotropy and a midscale one .",
    "the first one is proposed to be generated by galactic crs interacting with the magnetic field in the local interstellar space surrounding the heliosphere ( scale @xmath102 pc ) .    about the medium scale anisotropy",
    ", no theory of crs in the galaxy exists yet which is able to explain few degrees anisotropies in the rigidity region 1 - 10 tv leaving the standard model of crs and that of the local galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time .",
    "all the solutions proposed to explain the phenomenon are too complex to fit in this work . for quite a complete review see @xcite .",
    "current experimental results show that the main features of the anisotropy are uniform in the energy range ( 10@xmath16 - 10@xmath17 ev ) .",
    "structures are there in every region of the harmonic domain down to angular scales as narrow as @xmath18 .",
    "so far , no theory of crs in the galaxy exists which is able to explain both large scale and few degrees anisotropies leaving the standard model of crs and that of the local galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time .",
