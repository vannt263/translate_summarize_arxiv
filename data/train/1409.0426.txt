    "shive s torsional wave machine@xcite is one of the most widely used apparatuses for demonstrating mechanical waves in physics and engineering courses .",
    "because most waves travel at speeds that are difficult to view , shive created his wave machine to demonstrate slower transverse waves .",
    "shive s machine can be used to demonstrate phenomena such as wave propagation , reflection and transmission at a boundary ( fixed or free ) , constructive and destructive interference , standing waves and resonances , and impedance matching.@xcite    according to shive , the speed of the waves traveling along a torsional wave machine is a constant that depends on the stiffness of the wire and on the moment of inertia of the rods . however , burgel  @xcite realized that the speed of the waves traveling through a wave machine depends on the frequency , meaning a torsional wave machine is dispersive .",
    "after a thorough analysis , burgel concluded that the origin of the dispersion lies in the discreteness of the medium ( in this case , the rods through which the waves propagate ) .",
    "in the present paper , we re - examine burgel s analysis and show that there are actually two sources of dispersion in a torsional wave machine .",
    "one source indeed originates from the discreteness of the medium , but a second , more important source originates from a restoring gravitational torque . we show that for practical purposes , the restoring gravitational torque is the only source of dispersion , whereas the effect of discreteness on the dispersion is negligible .",
    "in addition , we show that the gravitationally - induced dispersion is reduced in reduced gravity , and that it disappears in a zero - gravity environment .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we review the wave equation and the dispersion relation of a torsional wave machine . we also obtain the dispersion relation in the case that the discreteness of the rods is ignored and also when the gravitational field strength goes to zero . in sec .  [",
    "sec : exparra ] , we present the experimental procedure used to measure the harmonics of the wave machine , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : expres ] , we compare the experimental data with the theoretical predictions .",
    "section  [ sec : conclus ] contains our conclusions .    due to the simplicity of the experiments ,",
    "the tractability of the theory , and the good agreement between theory and experiment , the results of our analysis can be easily adapted to an undergraduate laboratory on harmonics ( normal modes ) , dispersion relations , and wave dispersion .",
    "in our experiments , we use two pasco wave machines.@xcite these wave machines have a central wire that is square shaped in cross section and runs through eleven supports ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : exap ] ) . in one of the wave machines , the rods are 0.228-m long ( the `` short - rod machine '' ) , whereas in the other one the rods are 0.456-m long ( the `` long - rod machine '' ) .",
    "each rod s center of mass is just below the wire , allowing the rods to be balanced horizontally in normal gravity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] ) .",
    "the long - rod machine has @xmath0 rods and a length of @xmath1 m , and the short - rod machine has @xmath2 rods and a length of @xmath3 m .",
    "the theory describing motion in a wave machine is well known.@xcite each rod of the machine oscillates as a pendulum around its horizontal , equilibrium position . as the torsion wire twists , the rods tilt away from their stable , equilibrium position , and two restoring torques act on the rods , one stemming from gravity and another one from the torsion of the wire .",
    "let us denote by @xmath4 the rod number , with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total number of rods .",
    "when the @xmath4th rod is tilted , its weight produces a torque about the axis of rotation given by [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : torque](b ) ] @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the rod , @xmath9 is the gravitational field strength , @xmath10 is the rod s radius , and @xmath11 is the angular displacement from the horizontal , equilibrium position .",
    "the minus sign arises from the restoring nature of the gravitational torque . for small oscillations ,",
    "the gravitational torque can be approximated by @xmath12 the torque on the @xmath4th rod due to the twisting of the torsion wire can be written as@xcite @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 denotes the torsion constant of a section of the wire of length @xmath15 , @xmath15 being the distance between two consecutive rods . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ gt ] ) and  ( [ tt ] ) with newton s second law for rotational motion , we obtain the equation of motion @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the moment of inertia of one rod .",
    "equation  ( [ eqmonrod ] ) holds for all but the end rods ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the end rods depends on the boundary conditions ( either free or fixed ) , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "when we send a pulse through a wave machine , the shape of the pulse does not change appreciably , and therefore the different frequencies making up the pulse travel at nearly the same speed @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for most applications , one can safely assume that the wave machine is non - dispersive .",
    "however , as first pointed out by burgel,@xcite the wave machine is actually dispersive . as shown in ref .  , the dispersion relation associated with eq .",
    "( [ eqmonrod ] ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angular frequency of the torsional mode , and @xmath23 is the angular frequency of the pendulum mode , in which the wave machine oscillates due to gravity alone ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) , there are two sources of dispersion .",
    "one source , due to the discreteness of the wave machine , is encoded in the separation @xmath15 between the rods .",
    "the second source , due to the gravitational restoring torque , is encoded in the pendulum - mode frequency . for the pasco wave machines , the dispersion due to the discreteness of the rods is negligible , because the wavelength of the waves traveling on the machines is always much larger than @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is always small and we can approximate @xmath27 . within this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the wave speed provided by shive@xcite ( we provide an alternative derivation of the wave speed in appendix  [ sec : wsam ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ shivespeed ] ) , @xmath30 is the torsion constant of the entire wire of length @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the moment of inertia of the whole set of @xmath6 rods .    the phase and group velocities can be easily calculated from eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) , giving @xmath33 and @xmath34 because the phase and group velocities are different , the wave machine is dispersive even when we neglect the discreteness of the rods  the source of dispersion is the gravitational restoring torque .",
    "interestingly , the gravitationally - induced dispersion disappears if we turn gravity off . to see this",
    ", we let @xmath9 go to zero in eqs .",
    "( [ omegap ] ) and  ( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) to get @xmath35 which leads to identical expressions for the group and phase velocities : @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 thus , when we neglect the discreteness of the rods _ and _ turn off gravity , the wave machine becomes non - dispersive .    figure  [ fig : generaldis ] shows a plot of the dispersion relations ( @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 ) from eqs .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) , ( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) , and ( [ dispredtodgonlyg0 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : generaldis ] , we can see that the wave machines have three regions of dispersion . in the first region , which corresponds to low wave numbers , the exact dispersion relation given by eq .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) is well - approximated by eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) .",
    "thus , for low wave numbers the dispersion is due solely to the restoring gravitational torque . in this low-@xmath39 region",
    ", we find the pendulum mode ( which corresponds to the @xmath40-intercept ) and the lowest harmonics of the wave machine . in the second region , which corresponds to intermediate wave numbers , we have a dispersion - free region , since both eqs .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) and  ( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) are well approximated by the linear relationship given by eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonlyg0 ] ) .",
    "there is also a third , high-@xmath39 region of dispersion , where the exact dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) ] is not well - approximated by either eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonlyg0 ] ) .",
    "the dispersion in the high-@xmath39 region is due solely to the discreteness of the rods . in this high-@xmath39 region",
    ", there is a cut - off frequency , set by the spacing between rods in the wave machine.@xcite in the pasco wave machines , this high-@xmath39 region is not attainable .    another way to see that the dispersion relation at low wave numbers is due solely to the gravitational torque and not to the discreteness of the rods is to determine the equation of motion and then find the dispersion relation when the rods are so close together that they can be considered a continuum .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is , not surprisingly , given by eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) ( see appendix  [ sec : extension ] for details ) .",
    "thus , even when we ignore the discreteness of the rods from the start , we still have a gravitationally - induced dispersion at low wave numbers .",
    "we note in passing that the dispersion relation in the wave machine [ eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) ] is mathematically equivalent to the dispersion relation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma at high frequencies ( see ref .  )",
    ". such dispersion in a plasma is enhanced ( diminished ) whenever the charge of the particles in the plasma is increased ( decreased ) , much like the dispersion in a wave machine is enhanced ( diminished ) when the gravitational field strength is increased ( decreased ) .",
    "an accelerometer ( vernier 3d - bta ) was mounted on one end of the torsion wire of the wave machine ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : exap ] ) , and connected to a computer through an interface ( vernier labquest mini ) .",
    "a wave pulse was then sent through the wave machine , and the accelerometer signal was converted into a frequency spectrum using a built - in fast fourier transform ( fft ) routine . a sample frequency spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : fft ] . by clicking on the center of each peak of the frequency spectrum",
    ", we can measure the frequency of the harmonics excited by the pulse ; the resulting frequencies are listed in table  [ table : freq ] .",
    "the uncertainty in each frequency was obtained as the half - width at half - maximum of the peak in the frequency spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that different pulses may yield slightly different frequency spectra , and therefore slightly different harmonic frequencies , especially for the lowest harmonics . in such cases ,",
    "the harmonic frequency can be taken as the average of the different measurements .",
    "an alternative way to measure the harmonic frequencies is to excite the harmonics of the wave machine individually by way of an oscillator , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exap](b ) . to accomplish this",
    ", we mounted a push / pull accessory ( pasco me-8751 ) on an oscillator ( pasco me-8750 ) driven by a power supply .",
    "the push / pull accessory was attached to one of the end rods of the wave machine , on the opposite end to the accelerometer .",
    "the frequency of the oscillator was then increased incrementally until a resonance was obtained . near the resonance ,",
    "the frequency was finely tuned until the amplitude of the oscillation of the antinodes was as large as possible .",
    "the resulting frequency spectrum was just a sharp peak centered at the resonant ( harmonic ) frequency . by visually inspecting the number @xmath41 of antinodes of the harmonic",
    ", we were able to determine the wave number using a simple standing - wave analysis ( see below ) . except for the lowest harmonics , this method resulted in values that were within 3% of the values obtained using an fft analysis of a wave pulse .",
    "for the lowest harmonics ( @xmath42 ) , the agreement was about 10% or better .",
    "the reason for the relatively poor agreement for the lowest harmonics is that we found it nearly impossible to excite only a single harmonic for such low frequencies .",
    "thus , our measured frequencies for the pendulum mode and the lowest harmonics are the most unreliable .",
    "the main advantage of using an oscillator to measure the frequencies is that students can see that each peak of the frequency spectrum corresponds to a specific standing wave mode .",
    "however , using the oscillator has some disadvantages .",
    "first , the data acquisition takes much longer than using an fft analysis of a wave pulse .",
    "second , we were only able to measure the first ten harmonics when using the oscillator , whereas the fft analysis of a wave pulse allowed us to find over nineteen harmonics .",
    "the wavelengths of the harmonics produced in a wave machine mimic exactly the wavelengths of the harmonics produced in a pipe.@xcite when both ends of the wave machine are free to oscillate ( which corresponds to an open pipe ) , the wavelengths can be written @xmath43,}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the number of antinodes of the wave machine .",

    "\\label{wnfxe}\\ ] ]    in order to show the dependence of dispersion on gravity , we placed the wave machines in three different orientations . in the first arrangement",
    "the wave machines are positioned horizontally , so the gravitational field strength @xmath9 that appears in eqs .",
    "( [ dispredtod ] ) and  ( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) is given by 9.8m / s@xmath47 ( one `` @xmath9 '' ) . in the second arrangement we tilt the wave machines by an angle @xmath48 , thereby reducing the effect of gravity by @xmath49 ( see fig .  [ fig : tiltbyalpha ] ) .",
    "in this arrangement , we thus have a gravitational field strength of 4.90 m/s ( one - half @xmath9 ) .",
    "finally , in the third arrangement we hang the wave machines vertically , thereby eliminating the effect of gravity and producing a zero-@xmath9 environment .",
    "the measured frequencies for both wave machines in these three arrangements are listed in table  [ table : freq ] .",
    "it is important to note that because the wave machines are built to run horizontally , the friction between the rods and the supports increases quite a bit when the machines are tilted or hung . in order to minimize such friction , we connected the torsion wire of the wave machine to a fixed pole while the frame of the wave machine was immobilized by two supports.@xcite",
    "in order to compare theory and experiment , we first need to determine the wave speeds and pendulum - mode frequencies . to determine these values , we perform linear regressions of the @xmath50 vs.  @xmath51 data of table  [ table : freq ] using eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) for the one-@xmath9 and the half-@xmath9 experiments .",
    "these regressions yield the wave speeds @xmath20 ( the square root of the slope ) and the pendulum - mode frequencies @xmath52 ( the square root of the @xmath40-intercept ) .",

    "all of the fits had @xmath53 or higher and are summarized in table ii . from this table",

    "@xmath39 is plotted in units of @xmath55 , so the wave numbers of the fixed - end harmonics are given by the odd integers ( squares ) , whereas the wave numbers of the free - end harmonics are given by even integers ( circles ) .",
    "the error bars are about the size of the data points and have not been included .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment shows that eq .",
    "( [ dispredtodgonly ] ) fully accounts for the dispersion in the wave machines .",
    "thus , for waves that can actually be created in the wave machines , the discreteness of the rods has no observable effect on the dispersion .",

    "again we plot the measured harmonic frequencies along with the dispersion relation given in eq .",

    "clearly how the gravitational dispersion in the wave machine decreases as we reduce the effect of gravity , fig .",
    "[ fig : gdl ] shows the pendulum mode and the first five harmonics of the long - rod wave machine for all three experiments . here",
    ", we can see how the harmonic frequencies approach the straight line as gravity is reduced to zero .      in the non - dispersive region ,",
    "the theoretical wave speed in a torsional wave machine is given by eq .",
    "( [ shivespeed ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that because the long - machine rods are twice as long and twice as massive as the short - machine rods , and since their moments of inertia are @xmath56 , where @xmath8 is the mass of a rod and @xmath57 its length,@xcite the speeds in the short and long wave machines are ( theoretically ) related by@xcite @xmath58 experimentally , we find that the ratio of the averages of the speeds is @xmath59 in good agreement with the theoretical result . it should be noted that this ratio is often reported simply as three.@xcite",
    "we have shown that dispersion in a torsional wave machine is due to gravity , and that such dispersion diminishes as gravity decreases . experimentally , we reduced the effective gravitational strength by tilting the wave machine . in the limit when gravity goes to zero ( in our case , when the wave machines are hung vertically )",
    ", we showed that the gravitationally - induced dispersion disappears and the wave machines becomes non - dispersive .",
    "our conclusions are restricted to the pasco torsional wave machines used in our experiments ( or other similar devices ) , and do not apply to all wave machines . for example , there is no gravitational dispersion in the wave machine used in refs .   and because this wave machine hangs from both ends rather than laying on supports .",
    "thus , the dispersion in this machine results only from the discreteness of the rods .",
    "it should also be noted that in torsional wave machines of the type used in our experiment , the dispersion induced by the discreteness of the rods would be measurable if the rods were separated by a larger distance .",
    "finally , we would like to note that the two wave machines discussed here were flown in nasa s reduced gravity flight program in july 2012 .",
    "the nasa flight allowed us to test the theory both at zero@xmath9 and at 1.8@xmath9 . in the nasa flight , we excited the harmonics of the wave machine using an oscillator that was turned on and off for brief periods of time .",
    "the frequency of the oscillator was low , in order to excite mainly the lowest harmonics . when the oscillator was on , we had free - end boundary conditions , and when it was off , we had fixed - end boundary conditions .    unfortunately , although our ground test of the experiment worked well , the results of the nasa flight do not agree conclusively with the results of the present paper .",
    "one possible reason is that , in the experiment in the nasa flight , the intervals during which the oscillator was turned on and off were not in sync with the periods of climbing ( 1.8@xmath9 ) and descending ( zero@xmath9 ) of the aircraft . a better procedure for this experiment would be the following : ( 1 ) manually excite a wave pulse at the beginning of a descending period of the aircraft and collect the fft in zero@xmath9 ; ( 2 ) stop the motion of the wave machine at the end of the descending period ; ( 3 ) excite a new wave pulse at the beginning of the climbing period and collect a new fft in 1.8@xmath9 ; ( 4 ) repeat steps ( 1)(3 ) for successive cycles of zero@xmath9 and 1.8@xmath9 ; ( 5 ) after the flight , obtain the harmonics in 1.8@xmath9 and zero@xmath9 from the ffts .",

    "in this appendix , we derive the equation of motion that describes the motion of a torsional wave machine in the continuum limit that the distance @xmath15 between the rods goes to zero . using this equation of motion",
