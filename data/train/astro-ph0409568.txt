    "the intercepted flux depends of course on the geometry of emission : it will be lower than the values estimated above if the x - ray emission is beamed in the direction normal to the orbital plane . however , it is possible that the intercepted flux is at least of the same order of magnitude as the intrinsic emission from the star ( @xmath59@xmath60 erg s@xmath13 in the bsg phase ) , causing the star to appear bluer and brighter than an isolated star of the same mass and age .",
    "there is of course no firm evidence yet for this scenario , so ours is only a speculation , at this stage .    another piece of evidence in favour of star no .  1 as the true optical counterpart comes from a 1200s continuum - subtracted h@xmath7 image ( fig .  13 ) taken by m. pakull & l. mirioni with the 3.6 m canada france hawaii telescope ( chft ) , on 2000 march 11 .",

    "detection of such modulations is well within the capabilities of the wfpc2 or the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board _",
    "hst_. a series of exposures over a longer period of time ( a few days ) is needed to investigate this possibility , which would strongly constrain the binary period .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of ngc4559 x7 ( paper i ) implies an accretion rate onto the bh of @xmath62@xmath63  yr@xmath13 , assuming isotropic emission and an efficiency @xmath64 .",
    "if the bolometric luminosity is considered , an accretion rate @xmath65  yr@xmath13 is required .",
    "massive supergiant stars are in an evolutionary phase at which a strong stellar wind drives a large mass loss . if star no .",
    "1 has a mass @xmath3@xmath56 , its mass loss rate in the stellar wind is @xmath66@xmath67  yr@xmath13   ( @xmath68  g  s@xmath13 ) in the bsg stage ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) .",
    "this rate is sustained for a timescale @xmath69  yr . as the star evolves towards the rsg stage , the mass loss rate in the wind will eventually increase to @xmath70  yr@xmath13 for a timescale of @xmath71  yr . if the donor star is close to filling its roche lobe , the stellar wind is focused , and as a consequence almost all the wind material will be accreted onto the bh ; this situation occurs for example in the galactic source cyg x-1 ( tarasov , brocksopp & lyuty 2003 ) .",
    "such rates of mass transfer in a focussed wind can produce x - rays luminosities typical of moderately bright ulxs .",
    "however , the mass loss rate expected from star no .  1 is not sufficient to explain the isotropic luminosity of ngc4559 x7 .",
    "moreover , a stellar wind is certainly not strong enough to account for the observed luminosity if the donor star in the x7 system has a mass @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "a higher accretion rate can be obtained if the donor is directly overflowing its roche lobe ( e.g. , wellstein , langer & braun 2001 ; vanbeveren , de loore & van rensberg 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", all the mass lost from the donor star will be captured by the bh .",
    "the bh candidate lmc x-3 is an example of an x - ray binary containing an early - type star transferring mass onto a ( slightly ) more massive bh via roche lobe overflow ( e.g. , wu et al .",
    "2001 ) . for a @xmath72 star ,",
    "peak mass transfer rates of @xmath73  yr@xmath13 can be achieved , over a thermal timescale @xmath74  yr .",
    "( podsiadlowski , rappaport & han 2003 ; wellstein et al .",
    "a proper determination of the accretion rate requires a study of the stability criteria for mass transfer as a function of mass ratio , evolutionary stage of the donor star , and rate of loss of angular momentum in a stellar or disk wind ( ritter 1988 ; wu 1997 ) .",
    "the stability and duration of mass transfer , in turns , affect the lifetime of the x - ray phase , the mass transfer duty cycle , and the long- and short - term x - ray variabilities , and determine the relative abundance of active ulxs observable in young stellar environments at any given time .",
    "we leave a quantitative investigation of the physical conditions for stable roche - lobe mass transfer in ulxs , for a range of possible mass ratios , to a follow - up paper . here",
    "we simply point out one phenomenon that may be significant for our understanding of mass transfer in ulxs . in a binary system where mass is transferred from the less massive to the more massive component ( as we suppose being the case for most ulxs , and in particular for ngc4559 x7 ) , the orbit widens , and therefore the roche lobe of the donor star expands . if the donor is a main sequence or subgiant star , its adiabatic mass - radius exponent is @xmath75 , i.e. , its thermal equilibrium radius decreases as the star loses mass .",
    "hence , the star will soon become detached from its roche lobe and mass transfer will cease , until contact is regained . a loss of angular momentum from the system ( for example through a wind )",
    "is required to counteract this effect and shrink the orbit , thus ensuring a steady mass transfer . however ,",
    "if the donor is a supergiant star , its mass - radius exponent is @xmath76 , so its thermal equilibrium radius will increase as the star loses mass ( wellstein et al .",
    "hence , a supergiant donor may remain in contact with its roche lobe and keep transferring mass steadily onto a more massive bh at a high rate , throughout its lifetime ( up to @xmath77 yr ) , even in the absence of angular momentum losses .",
    "thus , we speculate that an o- or b - type supergiant star transferring mass via roche - lobe overflow onto a more massive bh could be a natural explanation for persistent ulxs . incidentally , this argument also suggests that the optical counterpart of x7 is more likely to be one of the supergiant stars listed in table 2 , rather than any of the fainter main - sequence stars in the same field .    finally , although we can not yet identify the donor star , we can rule out an association of the ulx with a young , massive cluster .",
    "there is a small group of young stars but no bright clusters inside the x - ray error circle ( fig .",
    "3 ) : all the optical sources are consistent with single stars or , at most , the superposition of a few stars . the only moderately - large cluster in the field is located @xmath78 pc away ( projected distance , without considering the viewing angle ) , on the south - eastern side of the star - forming complex .",
    "given the age of the cluster , a physical association would require an ejection speed @xmath79 km s@xmath13 for the ulx binary system .",
    "this value is too large to be consistent with an intermediate - mass bh ( zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "the chft h@xmath7 image shows more clearly the structure of the large star - forming complex around the ulx . the ring - like structure of the hii region ( figs",
    ".  13 , 14 ) suggests that an expanding wave of star formation has recently moved from a centre ( which appears to be near but not coincident with the ulx ) outwards . assuming a salpeter imf down to a lower mass limit of @xmath80 , as explained in sect .",
    "4.3 , we estimate from starburst99 models ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) that continuous star formation over the last 30 myr at a rate of @xmath81@xmath82 yr@xmath13 ( depending on the choice of metal abundance and upper mass limit ) would account for the integrated luminosity ( @xmath83 ) and the observed number of o stars instead , the inferred star formation rate is @xmath84@xmath85 yr@xmath13 . ] .",
    "this rate implies a mass in stars of @xmath86@xmath87 .",
    "the efficiency for the conversion of molecular gas into stars is generally @xmath88 ( e.g. , tan 2000 ; planesas , colina & perez - olea 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , some of the gas will be in atomic form ; we have no observational data to determine the h / h@xmath89 ratio in this region , but we can assume for the sake of our order - of - magnitude calculation that they contribute in equal measure ; we shall later see that this assumption is justified .",
    "therefore , we estimate that the total mass ( stars plus swept - up gas ) in this complex is at least a few @xmath90 .    on the other hand",
    ", we can also place an upper limit to the total mass in the region .",
    "we see from the _ xmm - newton_/om image ( fig .",
    "1 ) that it is located just outside the star - forming region in the disk of ngc4559 .",
    "this suggests that , before the triggering event , the local surface density was just below the threshold necessary for the onset of gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "there are two empirical thresholds for star formation ( elmegreen 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "a constant - density threshold ( more often applied to dwarf and irregular galaxies ) requires a total surface density @xmath91 pc@xmath92 .",
    "alternatively , a variable threshold based on toomre s stability criterion ( toomre 1964 ) is more often applied to spiral galaxies : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an empirical constant , @xmath95 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath96 is the epicyclic frequency at radial distance @xmath97 , and @xmath38 is the circular velocity of the galaxy at radius @xmath97 ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 , 1998 ; wong & blitz 2002 ; boissier et al .",

    "the star - forming complex has a projected area on the sky of @xmath105 arcsec@xmath106 . considering the viewing angle",
    ", this corresponds to a physical area of @xmath107 pc@xmath106 . from this",
    ", we can estimate that the total mass ( essentially , atomic and molecular gas ) contained in that region before the triggering of star formation was @xmath108 .",
    "combining this upper limit with the lower limit derived earlier , we can conclude that the star - forming complex contains a total mass @xmath101@xmath109 .",
    "we speculate that an initial perturbation caused a local increase in the gas density , triggering an expanding wave of star formation . considering the average star - formation rate estimated earlier , and the size of the ring where star formation has taken place , we can use a relation in kennicutt ( 1998 ) ( see , in particular , his figure 6 ) to estimate the gas density in the ring : we infer that @xmath110@xmath111 pc@xmath92 .",
    "therefore , a small density perturbation , by a factor @xmath112 , would have sufficed to trigger the star - forming event .    as an aside",

    "a strong radiatively - driven wind is likely to be formed from the accretion disk surface , resulting in an optically - thick envelope or outflow enshrouding the x - ray source ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",

    "even stronger balmer line emission is found in the bh candidate ss433 , a system for which persistent super - eddington accretion has been invoked : the luminosity in the `` stationary '' h@xmath7 component ( thought to be mostly associated with the inner accretion disk and its envelope ) is @xmath140 erg s@xmath13 ( asadullaev et al .",

    "it was also suggested that the soft thermal component at @xmath142 kev often seen in those systems ( including ngc4559 x-7 : paper i ) may come from the down - scattering of harder x - ray photons in the outflow ( king & pounds 2003 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the h@xmath7 emission comes from x - ray ionized clouds around the ulx , a scenario similar to what is found in seyfert galaxies .",

    "we are planning to conduct new spectroscopic observations of the field , to investigate this issue .",

    "the star - forming complex in ngc4559 is a factor of two brighter than gould s belt and a factor of four fainter than the ngc6946 complex .",

    "none of them contains a ulx , unlike the star - forming complex in ngc4559 .",
    "this suggests that the ulx is a side effect , rather than the determinant factor for the triggering and subsequent evolution of the star - forming episode .",
    "possible explanations for the initial triggering of such complexes are ( elmegreen , efremov & larsen 2000 ; larsen et al .",
    "2002 ) : the collapse of a `` supergiant molecular cloud '' at the end of a spiral arm ; a hypernova explosion ( which in our case might also have been the progenitor of ngc4559 x7 ) ; or the infall of a high - velocity hi cloud or satellite galaxy through the outer galactic disk . in all cases ,",
    "the initial perturbation creates a radially expanding density wave or ionization front , which sweeps up the neutral interstellar medium .",

    "the large size of the complex in ngc4559 , its location in the outer disk , the lack of other star - forming regions nearby , and the absence of diffuse x - ray emitting gas inside the star - forming complex seem to favour the collision hypothesis over the hypernova model ( tenorio - tagle et al .",

    "a proper motion study of the milky way globular cluster ngc6397 ( rees & cudworth 2003 ) found that the cluster passed through the galactic disk @xmath170 myr ago , and may have dynamically triggered the formation of the young open cluster ngc6231 .",
    "an intriguing result of our optical study of the x7 environment is that we do indeed see an object that could have plunged through the gas - rich disk of ngc4559 , triggering the expanding density wave",
    ". the culprit could be the yellow galaxy located @xmath171   ( projected distance of @xmath172 pc ) north - west of the ulx ( figs .  2 , 14 , 15 ) .",
    "this object can not be a large background elliptical galaxy , because its isophotes are too irregular ( fig .",
    "its shape , size and luminosity are consistent with a dwarf irregular ( or , possibly , a tidally - disturbed dwarf elliptical ) at approximately the same distance as ngc4559 ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ) .",
    "we can not presently rule out the possibility that it is a chance line - of - sight coincidence , but we suggest that the most natural interpretation is a small satellite galaxy of ngc4559 .",
    "existing 21 cm hi radio observations ( e.g. , the whisp survey ) do not show any large - scale velocity distortions , but the satellite dwarf is perhaps too small to influence the global galactic kinematics significantly .",
    "however , as it crossed the disk , it would have significantly perturbed the local gas density , both hydrodynamically ( ram pressure ) and dynamically ( gravitational perturbation ) .",
    "a dirr galaxy contains both gas and dark matter , hence its impact would have been even more significant than that of a globular cluster .",
    "we are planning optical spectroscopic observations to determine the kinematics and distance of the dwarf galaxy , and therefore test this hypothesis .",
    "if the dirr galaxy is indeed physically associated with the star - forming complex , its integrated absolute brightness is @xmath173 , with observed color indices @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "these colors are typical of a population dominated by f5f8 main - sequence stars , suggesting an old age . assuming a single burst of star formation , we infer ( using starburst99 , leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) a visible stellar mass of @xmath176 for the galaxy and an age @xmath177 yr for the dominant component of its stellar population .    as a comparison",
    ", this candidate satellite galaxy would be somewhat similar to the faint dwarf irregular galaxy camelopardalis b ( cam b ) in the ic342/maffei group , which has @xmath178 , @xmath179 ( begum , chengalur & hopp 2003 ) .",
    "the stellar mass in cam b is estimated to be @xmath180 , and the total gas mass @xmath181 ; the total dynamical mass is @xmath182 , hence the galaxy is strongly dark - matter dominated ( begum et al .",
    "in fact , dark matter density dominates over stellar and gas density even in the inner regions .",
    "in addition to the old stellar component , the candidate satellite galaxy near ngc4559 shows two bright clusters and a few more , much fainter lumps .",
    "the two brightest clusters have luminosities @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and colors consistent with an age @xmath185 yr and masses of @xmath133 a few @xmath186 .",
    "their brightness and morphology is consistent with the star - forming complexes often found in dirr galaxies ( parodi & binggeli 2003 ) .",
    "we obtain that the percentage of flux in the @xmath187 band due to these star - forming complexes ( `` lumpiness index '' ) is @xmath188 of the total b - band flux , the same value found for a large sample of irregulars and spirals regardless of hubble type and galactic mass ( elmegreen & salzer 1999 ; parodi & binggeli 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the lumpiness index is thought to be a measure of star - formation efficiency .",
    "these considerations support the idea that the bright lumps are indeed clusters in the dirr satellite galaxy and not simply background or foreground stars in ngc4559 .",
    "the dwarf galaxy is also detected in the _ xmm - newton_/om image ( fig .",
    "16 ) , taken in the uvw1 filter ( @xmath189@xmath190  ) .",
    "this also indicates recent star formation , in addition to the old stellar population which would not be detected in the near - uv .",
    "( on the other hand , the h@xmath7 image , fig .",
    "13 , shows that the current star formation rate is negligible ) .",
    "the om count rate is @xmath191 ct s@xmath13 : if we assume that the colors of the younger population are typical of a b0v star , such a count rate in the uvw1 filter corresponds to @xmath192 , in agreement with the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 observations .",
    "it is possible that this small , later episode of star formation in the dirr galaxy may also have been triggered when this small satellite passed through the disk of ngc4559 .",
    "if so , the younger stars may have been formed either from gas left in the dwarf galaxy , or collected into its gravitational potential well as it passed through the gas - rich disk .",
    "the non - spherical appearance of the large star - forming complex in ngc4559 may be due to an oblique impact , possibly from the south - east to the north - west direction .",
    "the projected distance of the dirr from the centre of the star - forming ring is @xmath193 pc , corresponding to a projected relative velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath13 over 30 myr ; however , this is certainly a lower limit , since we have no elements to estimate the velocity component along the line of sight .",
    "thus , we could view the star - forming complex in ngc4559 as a small - scale version of the cartwheel galaxy , where many young ulxs have been detected in the expanding , star - forming ring ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the cartwheel ,",
    "the initial perturbation causing the expanding density wave is entirely due to the gravitational interaction between the two galaxies ; in the case of ngc4559 , it may be due both to the dynamical impulse and to the direct hydrodynamical interaction between the gas in the satellite and in the disk .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this possibility is left to a separate work .",
    "ngc4559 x7 offers an example of a bright ( @xmath194 erg s@xmath13 ) ulx in a low - metallicity , actively star - forming environment disturbed by close galaxy interactions .",
    "at least one , and often all of these elements seem to be a common feature for many of the galaxies hosting ulxs : for example , galactic interactions and high star - formation rates for the antennae ( zezas et al .  2002 ; fabbiano et al .  2003 ) , the cartwheel ring ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ) , m82 ( griffiths et al .",

    "2002 ) , and a group of nearby blue compact dwarfs including izw18 ( thuan et al .",
    "a preferential association between ulxs and interacting galaxies was shown in swartz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; a connection between ulx formation and low - z environments was suggested in pakull & mirioni ( 2002 ) .",
    "this leads us to speculate that these two environmental conditions may be particularly favourable for producing massive remnants .",
    "for example , galaxy mergers , close interactions , and collisions with satellite galaxies or high - velocity hi clouds favour clustered star formation .",
    "the core of young star clusters is an environment where intermediate - mass bhs ( with masses up to @xmath195 ) may be formed , through the spitzer instability , runaway core collapse and merger of the o stars ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; rasio , freitag & grkan  2003 ; grkan , freitag & rasio 2004 ) .",
    "one of the open questions ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) is what range of cluster masses and radii offers the best chance for the core collapse / stellar coalescence process to occur within the lifetime of its more massive o stars ( @xmath196 myr ) .",
    "however , we have found that this ulx in ngc4559 is not located in or near a bright cluster : hence , this formation channel seems unlikely for this object , unless the parent cluster has already dispersed . the tidal disruption of a massive parent cluster on a timescale @xmath197 myr is also unlikely a few @xmath198 and @xmath133 a few @xmath199 do get disrupted on a shorter timescale because of explosive gas losses ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) ; however , in that case the dispersal occurs on a timescale @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the crossing timescale , @xmath202 is the core - collapse timescale , and @xmath203 is the relaxation timescale ( spitzer 1987 ) . in other words ,",
    "the disruption would occur before there is enough time for the core to collapse .",
    "moreover , the mass of the collapsed core is found to be @xmath204 times the total cluster mass ( grkan et al .",
    "2004 ) ; hence , clusters in this mass range would probably not be able to produce bhs more massive than @xmath205 . ] .    on the other hand , low metal abundance may , in principle , have an effect at at least two different stages : by allowing the formation of more massive progenitor stars ; and by helping the formation of a more massive compact object from a `` normal '' progenitor star .",
    "the first of these effects is usually invoked to predict the formation of massive population iii stars ( and , subsequently , of intermediate - mass bh remnants ) at high redshift ( madau & rees 2001 ) . for metal abundances @xmath206 , molecular hydrogen is the only effective coolant in dense cloud cores",
    ". the cloud temperature can not decrease below @xmath133 a few @xmath207 k regardless of density , and the jeans mass remains @xmath133 a few @xmath208 at all stages .",
    "thus , a dense clump will collapse into a single , very massive star ( bromm 2004 , and references therein ) without further sub - fragmentation .",
    "this simple mechansism does not work for smc - type metal abundances such as those found in ngc4559 and in other nearby metal - poor dwarf galaxies with ulxs .",
    "it is also highly unlikely that zero - metallicity gas could still be present in the outskirts of those galaxies .",
    "however , it is possible that other mechanism may lead to the same effect , making the cooling timescale longer than the dynamical timescale ( timescale for collapse ) , and therefore reducing the fragmentation during the cloud collapse .",
    "for example , we may speculate that a combination of reduced metal abundance and external heating of the cloud cores during the galaxy collision process ( through shocks and turbulence ) might lead to the formation of more massive stars and remnants .",
    "the balance of heating and cooling in a molecular cloud core can be approximately expressed through a polytropic equation of state , @xmath209 .",
    "it was suggested ( spaans & silk 2000 ; li , klessen & mac low 2003 ) that a stiff polytropic index @xmath210 should reduce or suppress fragmentation during the molecular core collapse , leading to the formation of imore massive stars .",
    "this naturally occurs in a gas with primordial metal abundances , but it may also occur at higher metallicities ( @xmath211 ) for example if the gas is irradiated by an ir background ( @xmath212 k ; spaans & silk 2000 ) .    the effect of low metal abundance on the evolution of normal early - type stars is to reduce the mass - loss rate in the radiatively - driven wind ( @xmath213 : vink , de koter & lamers  2001 ; see also bouret et al .",
    "this leads to a more massive stellar core , which may then collapse into a more massive bh , via normal stellar evolution .",
    "hence , low abundances may explain the formation of isolated bhs with masses up to @xmath214 ( i.e. , up to @xmath133 half of the mass of the progenitor star ) and isotropic eddington luminosities @xmath215 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of core collapse in massive stars by fryer ( 1999 ) and fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) found that they could not produce bh remnants more massive than @xmath0",
    ". however , they did not rule out the possibility of higher bh masses formed from stellar progenitors more massive than @xmath216 if wind losses are negligible .",
    "based on the previous qualitative arguments , if accreting bhs with masses @xmath217@xmath11 ( more massive than those found in milky way x - ray binaries ) can indeed be formed from stellar evolution processes , they would be natural candidates to explain most ulxs , up to isotropic luminosities @xmath141 erg s@xmath13 , without additional assumptions on the geometry of emission .",
    "however , ngc4559 x7 has an isotropic luminosity persistently @xmath218 erg s@xmath13 in the @xmath26@xmath27 kev band , and an extrapolated bolometric luminosity @xmath219 erg s@xmath13 ( paper i ) : hence , it may still be too bright to be a `` normal '' stellar - mass remnant , if we assume strictly eddington - limited isotropic emission .",
    "therefore , we are left with three alternatives for this source . a `` normal '' stellar - mass bh ( @xmath220 )",
    "would require either strong , collimated beaming ( it would effectively be a microblazar ) or strongly super - eddington emission . a @xmath217@xmath11 bh accreting from a @xmath221@xmath56 supergiant companion would require only mildly anisotropic emission ( geometrical beaming of a factor @xmath222@xmath27 ; king 2004 ) or mildly super - eddington luminosity .",
    "an intermediate - mass bh ( @xmath223 ) would allow for isotropic , sub - eddington emission .",
    "the x - ray spectral data ( paper i ) show the presence of a very soft thermal component ( @xmath224@xmath225 kev ) ; if fitted with a standard disk - blackbody model truncated at the schwarzschild innermost stable orbit , its luminosity and temperature together suggest a mass @xmath226 . it has been suggested ( king & pounds 2003 ) that the very soft thermal component seen in this and other ulxs may not be an indicator of the inner - disk temperature , but",
    "may instead be the result of photon down - scattering in an optically - thick outflow shrouding the central x - ray source .",
    "this radiatively - driven outflow would be more likely for x - ray sources emitting close or above the eddington limit .",
    "if we accept this argument , we can not rule out the alternative interpretation of this system as a @xmath217@xmath11 bh , with eddington or mildly super - eddington emission and perhaps mildly anisotropic emission ( gaining a factor @xmath227 in the observed flux from the combination of the two effects ) . on the other hand , miller , fabian & miller  ( 2004 ) argue that the presence of a power - law hard component of similar luminosity ( @xmath228 erg s@xmath13 ) to that of the soft thermal component requires a bh with mass @xmath229 .",
    "the x - ray timing data ( paper i ) suggest the presence of a break in the power density spectrum at @xmath230 hz ; this can indicate either a bh mass @xmath216 or @xmath226 , depending on the identification of the break in comparison with standard power density spectra of x - ray binaries and agn .",
    "in any case , we can conclude that these x - ray findings are not consistent with a low - mass , relativistically - beamed microblazar scenario , and suggest a bh mass @xmath231 .",
    "( see also davis & mushotzsky ( 2004 ) for a more general argument against strong beaming . )",
    "the optical data indicate an association with a young region of massive star formation at the edge of the galactic disk ( age @xmath197 myr ) .",
    "they also rule out an association between the ulx and massive star clusters ; hence , they rule out at least one mechanism of formation for an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "other formation processes have been proposed for such objects : e.g. , from population iii stars . however , in this case , rather contrived hypotheses would be required to explain its location in a young star - forming complex on the galactic disk plane , and the capture of a companion star .",
    "therefore , on balance , the optical data are more consistent with a bh originating in the recent episode of massive star formation , and accreting from an ob companion .",
    "a possible counterargument against the existence of a @xmath217@xmath11 bh in this field is that it would require a progenitor star at least twice as massive ; yet , all the stars we see today are consistent with normal ob stars , and there are no extraordinarily bright stellar objects",
    ". this may be the case if the peculiar physical conditions in the molecular gas that led to the formation of very massive stars were present only for a short time at the beginning of the star - forming episode , when the perturbation was stronger .",
    "all the very massive stars formed at the time have already died , and star formation proceeds today in a more conventional way , while the density wave expands and weakens .",
    "another possibility is that , if such massive stars still exist today in this field , we may have mistaken them for star clusters .",
    "for example , we can not rule out that the bright ( @xmath232 ) , unresolved source described as a cluster in sect 4.4 might instead be a very massive star . in conclusion",
    ", we argue that a `` young '' @xmath217@xmath11 bh formed from stellar evolution processes is consistent with both the optical and the x - ray data .",
    "a bh with a mass @xmath229 would also be consistent with ( and in some respects preferred by ) the x - ray data , but much more difficult to reconcile with the optical results .",
    "further multi - band studies of this ulx ( in particular , radio and infrared ) are necessary to constrain the mass of the bh .",
    "we have used _ hst_/wfpc2 images in the @xmath187 , @xmath38 , @xmath233 bands , an _ xmm - newton_/om image in the uv band , and a ground - based h@xmath7 image to study the star - forming complex around a bright ulx at the edge of the late - type spiral ngc4559 .",
    "we find that star formation in the kpc - size complex near the ulx has occurred mostly over the last @xmath168 myr , and is still ongoing in the southern part of the complex .",
    "the ulx is co - located with a small group of ob stars , but is not located in the most active region of the star - forming complex .",
    "also , it does not appear to be associated with any massive young clusters or any extraordinary massive star : the brightest point source in the _ chandra _ error circle is consistent with a single blue supergiant of mass @xmath0 .",
    "a few other stars are resolved inside the error circle : mostly blue and red supergiants with inferred masses @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the candidate donor stars near x7 are consistent with an age @xmath3 myr , except for the brightest one , for which we estimate an age @xmath1 myr if it is a single , isolated star .",
    "however , it is possible that this star appears brighter and younger than its real age because of the effect of x - ray irradiation , if it is the true optical counterpart .",
    "h@xmath7 emission is also seen at the position of this star , and may come from x - ray ionized gas around the ulx .",
    "regardless of which is the true counterpart , it is very likely that the ngc4559 x7 ulx is a young system ( age @xmath3 myr ) with a high - mass donor .",
    "this is analogous to what is found for the few other ulxs with an identified optical counterpart ( liu et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; zampieri et al .",
    "it is also likely ( given its x - ray luminosity ) that accretion occurs via roche lobe overflow , and that the accreting bh is more massive than the secondary star , unlike typical high - mass x - ray binaries in the galaxy .",
    "this would imply that the orbit widens as mass is transferred , in the absence of other mechanisms to remove angular momentum from the system .",
    "we noted , qualitatively , that a supergiant donor may ensure a steady mass transfer rate , because its thermal equilibrium radius expands as its mass decreases ( unlike what happens for main - sequence stars ) . if the supergiant donor is massive enough ( @xmath234 ) , it may have a transfer rate @xmath235 yr@xmath13 over its nuclear timescale @xmath77 yr ( in the supergiant phase ) , as required by the observed luminosity",
    ".    we can not conclusively determine whether the accreting bh was formed via normal stellar evolution ( perhaps favoured by the low - metallicity environment or by galaxy collision processes ) , or is instead an intermediate - mass bh created via another mechanism .",
    "however , given the galactic disk location and the age of the local stellar population , a young bh associated with the recent episode of star formation appears much more likely than a primordial bh .",
    "runaway core collapse in a young super star cluster is one mechanism proposed for the formation of a young intermediate - mass bh in a starburst or star - forming region .",
    "however , our optical study does rule out this scenario for x7 .",
    "the only medium - size ( @xmath236 ) , young ( @xmath237 myr ) cluster in the field is located at @xmath238 pc from the ulx ; this distance also rules out a direct connection via bh ejection .",
    "further analysis of the _ chandra _ data ( see also paper i ) shows that there are no x - ray sources associated with this cluster , and in fact no other sources in the whole x7 field , brighter than the acis - s 12-count detection limit , corresponding to @xmath239 erg s@xmath13 for standard spectral models suitable to accreting sources .",
    "based on the results of our x - ray and optical studies , we suggest that the x7 ulx is consistent with a @xmath217@xmath11 bh recently formed from stellar evolution processes , and accreting from an ob companion via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "we have also studied the general properties of the stellar population in the large star - forming complex around x7 .",
    "its stellar population is consistent with an average star formation rate @xmath81@xmath240 over the last 30 myr .",
    "the observed optical colors and the blue - to - red supergiant ratio suggest a low metal abundance : @xmath4 ( using the padua tracks ) , or @xmath5 ( from the geneva tracks ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the low abundance found for the absorbing medium towards the x7 ulx , from our _ xmm - newton _ study ( table 1 , and paper i ) .",
    "the star - forming complex has a ring - like appearance ; it is only faintly connected to the outermost spiral arm of ngc4559 ( fig .  1 ) , and there are no other strongly star - forming regions nearby .",
    "this suggests that it is an expanding wave of star formation , triggered by an initial density perturbation , in a region where the gas was only marginally stable to gravitational collapse .",
    "similar isolated , ring- or shell - like star - forming complexes have been seen in the milky way and in nearby galaxies . a central super - star cluster or hypernova",
