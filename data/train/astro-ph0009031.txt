    "most neutron stars known in our galaxy have been identified either because they are accreting from a binary companion or because their rapid rotation and strong magnetic field produces a radio or x/@xmath6-ray pulsar .",
    "studies of accreting neutron stars or pulsars tell us far more about accretion and magnetospheric physics than they do about the intrinsic properties of neutron stars .",
    "based either on pulsar birthrates ( narayan & ostriker 1990 ) , or on the number of supernovae needed to account for the heavy element abundance of the galaxy ( arnett , schramm , & truran 1989 ) , there are 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "there are a few hundred accreting neutron star binaries currently known , and about 1000 radio pulsars .",
    "the accreting neutron stars and the pulsars are not representative of the vast majority of the neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "representatives of the non - accreting , non - pulsing variety of neutron stars have been eagerly sought over the past decade ( e.g. , greiner 1996 ; manning , jeffries , & willmore 1996 ; belloni , zampieri , & campana 1997 ) , and some likely candidates have been identified .",
    "these radio quiet neutron stars ( see caraveo , bignami , & trmper 1996 for a review ) form an inhomogeneous group .    some radio quiet neutron stars are associated with young supernova remnants .",
    "these may be radio - quiet because their radio emission is beamed ( e.g. , brazier & johnston 1999 ) , they are highly magnetized yet slowly rotating ( e.g. , vasisht et al . 1997 ) , or because they are not highly magnetized at birth because the fallback submerges the field ( geppert , page , & zannias 1999 ) . examples of young , radio quiet neutron stars include rx  j0822 - 4300 in pup  a ( gaensler , bock , & stappers 2000 ) and the central point source in cas  a ( chakrabarty et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these are still young and hot , and are x - ray - bright , with x - ray luminosities of order 10@xmath9  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "other radio quiet neutron star candidates are not associated with supernova remnants , and may be old .",
    "isolated neutron stars cool quickly ( e.g. , tsuruta 1998 ) , within about 1 million years ( myr ) , so most neutron stars should be faint ( of order 10@xmath10  erg  s@xmath1 or less ) , and difficult to find .",
    "a handful of old neutron star candidates have been discovered as x - ray sources in rosat images ( cf .",
    "caraveo et al .",
    "these are soft x - ray sources with approximately black body spectra , temperatures ( kt ) of 10 to 100 ev , and @xmath11 ratios in excess of 1000 .",
    "although some may be magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) , others may be bona - fide old , isolated , weakly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "such old isolated neutron stars afford the opportunity to study the atmospheres of neutron stars ( e.g. , pavlov et al . 1996b , rajagopal & romani 1996 ) .",
    "it is in principle possible to determine the composition , surface gravity , and angular diameter of an isolated neutron star from analysis of its spectrum .",
    "this can yield both the mass m and radius r , and place contraints on the nuclear equation of state ( e.g. , lattimer & prakash 1998 , 2000 ) . while it is possible to study the surfaces of pulsars by observing the unpulsed , thermal component ( e.g. , pavlov , stringfellow , & cordova 1996a ) , or to determine the mass from the orbital dynamics of the accreting matter ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; kaaret , ford , & chen 1997 ; zhang , strohmayer & swank 1997 ) or from modelling x - ray bursts ( haberl & titarchuk 1995 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is easier to do so for an isolated non - pulsing neutron star .    the brightest of these isolated neutron star candidates is rx  j185635 - 3754 ( walter , wolk , & neuhuser 1996 ) . its optical counterpart is a blue object with v@xmath1225.7 ( walter & matthews 1997 ) . on the basis of its 57  ev temperature , nearly thermal spectrum , and projection against the @xmath12130  pc - distant r  cra molecular cloud ( maracco & rydgren 1981 )",
    ", it would have an emitting area smaller than about 700  km@xmath13 if a blackbody . in the presence of an atmosphere , the emitting area , or radius ,",
    "must be larger than the blackbody of the same temperature .",
    "there is no evidence for x - ray pulsations , and it is radio - quiet . we observe emission from the entire surface of a neutron star , and not from a heated polar cap .    the important heating processes in an isolated neutron star are heat loss from the hot interior ( reviewed by tsuruta 1998 ) and accretion from the interstellar medium ( e.g. , blaes & madau 1993 ; treves et al .",
    "2000 ) . in standard cooling models",
    "the surface temperature is expected to plummet below 10@xmath14k within 1  myr , but various surface reheating schemes have been proposed ( e.g. , larson & link 1999 ) to keep the surface hot for longer times .",
    "heating via accretion from the interstellar medium does not decay with time ( although it will vary with the density of the local interstellar medium ) , but if the space velocity exceeds about 15  km  s@xmath1 , bondi - hoyle accretion from the interstellar gas should be negligable .",
    "the uncomplicated , isolated , radio quiet neutron star rx  j185635 - 3754 affords the opportunity to study the immaculate surface of a neutron star . to interpret the spectral energy distribution properly , and to determine its radius , we need its distance . here",
    "i report on the astrometric analysis of 3 images of rx  j185635 - 3754 taken with the hubble space telescope wfpc2 detector over the course of 3 years .",
    "these images reveal the parallax and proper motion of the target .",
    "we obtained 3 sets of observations with the hst wfpc2 camera ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the first epoch images were described by walter & matthews ( 1997 ) .",
    "the images were taken near the times of maximum parallactic displacement , which occurs on 3 october and 30 march .",
    "the images were dithered using the standard 5.5 pixel diagonal shift .",
    "the first and third observations each consist of 4 images ; we obtained 8 images during the second observation .",
    "the target is located near the center of the planetary camera ( pc ) .",
    "i did not analyze the images from the other cameras .",
    "i discuss here the images taken through the f606w filter .",
    "we also obtained images through the f178w , f300w , and f450w filters .",
    "the spectrophotometry will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "i analyzed the re - calibrated images delivered through the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) .",
    "for each of the three observations i produced a median - filtered , co - added image for astrometric and photometric analysis .",
    "i did this by rebinning the data to twice the nominal scale , shifting the dithered pc images by the nominal offsets , rebinning the images back to the nominal scale , and stacking the images .",
    "after median - filtering the images to remove cosmic rays , i co - added the images .",
    "all the analysis was performed using software written in the idl language , incorporating some software from the idl astronomy users library ( landsman 1995 ) .",
    "forty three objects are common to the three pc images , including the target ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) but excluding the brightest stars .",
    "four of these objects appear extended , and are likely to be galaxies .",
    "the approximate r - band magnitudes from aperture photometry range from 18.8 to 26.8 . in the images ,",
    "stars c , d , f , l , and m of walter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) appear to be overexposed .",
    "star 20 of campana et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is clearly a galaxy ; their star 25 is a visual pair with a separation of 0.2  arcsec .",
    "i measured the positions of the objects by fitting two dimensional gaussian and lorentzian line profile , and by fitting one - dimensional gaussians independently in ra and dec .",
    "the two dimensional fits utilize the mpfit2dpeak idl procedure .",
    "the lorentzian profile is more sharply peaked than the gaussian profile , and is somewhat better matched to the hst psf ( as estimated by the @xmath15 values for the fits ) .",
    "the two dimensional fits employ flat backgrounds .",
    "the advantage of the one - dimensional fits is that i can fit a varying ( up to second order ) background .",
    "this can improve the quality of the fit in confused regions , near bright stars , or near diffraction spikes .",
    "prior to fitting the data i corrected for the 34@xmath16 row error ( anderson & king 1999 ) and for the geometric distortions in the pc camera ( holtzman et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these detector coordinates are converted into celestial coordinates using the astrometric information in the fits header .",
    "the absolute positions depend on the particular guide stars used for each observation .",
    "the positions listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] are those measured from the 1996 october 6 image .",
    "relative to that image , the coordinates measured in the subsequent two images are offset by ( + 3.4,+0.6 ) and ( @xmath40.6,+0.3 ) arcsec in ra , dec .",
    "the astrometric reductions are done in x - y coordinates , corrected for detector distortions .",
    "i unrolled the images using the orientation given in the fits header , so that x , y correspond to ra , dec .",
    "direct comparison of the images shows no evidence of any residual roll or changes in the nominal plate scale of 0.0455 arcsec  pixel@xmath1 .",
    "the position of a star at epoch @xmath17 , relative to the initial position , is given by    x@xmath18 x@xmath19 = o@xmath20(@xmath17 ) + pm@xmath20 dt@xmath21 + @xmath22(dt@xmath21)/d , + y@xmath18 y@xmath19 = o@xmath23(@xmath17 ) + pm@xmath23 dt@xmath21 + @xmath24(dt@xmath21)/d +    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the observed position during observation @xmath17 , o is the systematic offset between the two coordinate systems , dt@xmath21 is the elapsed time since the first observation , pm is the proper motion , @xmath27 is the magnitude of the parallactic displacement at one pc , and d is the distance .",
    "the position angle of the major axis of the parallactic ellipse is 83@xmath3 .",
    "i determined the systematic offsets o@xmath20,o@xmath23 between the observations ( see above ) by taking the weighted mean of the differences in the x and y positions after rejecting positions that are discrepant from the mean at more than 3@xmath28 .",
    "the weighted mean and median offsets agree to better than 2  milli - arcsec .",
    "there was no evidence for any significant deviations from the nominal roll angle .",
    "removing the offset leaves a coupled set of 2 equations with two unknowns in each dimension , which i then solve for the parallax and proper motion .",
    "the measured motions of rx  j185635 - 3754 are summarized in table  [ tbl-3 ] , and the motion is shown in figure  [ fpmim ] .",
    "the three sets of measurements yield results which agree within their uncertainties . in table",
    "[ tbl-3 ] i quote 68% and 95% joint confidence uncertainties on the derived quantities . to determine the uncertainties , i ran a monte carlo simulation , selecting positions at random from a normally - distributed sample with mean equal to the measured offsets and variance equal to the measurement error .",
    "rx  j185635 - 3754 star is moving just south of east at a rate of @xmath29 of an arcsecond per year0.2  arcsec  yr@xmath1 in a southeasterly direction . ] .",
    "the parallax of 16  milli - arcsec ( 32 milli - arcsec full amplitude ) is detected at greater than 7@xmath28 .",
    "note that the directions of the proper motion and the major axis of the parallactic ellipse are co - aligned to within 17@xmath3 . a 1% error in the magnitude of the proper motion",
    "yields a 12% uncertainty in the parallax .",
    "the joint confidence contours ( figure  [ fig - cc ] ) show the correlation .",
    "the components of the space motion are illustrated in in figure  [ fig - pmpx ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - zpmpx ] shows the measured positions and the parallactic ellipse after subtracting the proper motion .",
    "since the determinations of the proper motion and parallax are done with respect to all the objects in the image , it is possible that they can be biased by systematic motions of the comparison stars .",
    "these would manifest themselves as systematic offsets in the two mean positions .",
    "given the brightnesses of the comparison stars , it is unlikely that there will be any detectable mean space motions or parallax .",
    "the brightest star , with f@xmath3018.9 , must be at a distance modulus in excess of 6 if an m dwarf ( the @xmath31 color suggests an f dwarf at a distance modulus in excess of 10 , although it could be a closer white dwarf ) . the bulk of the comparison stars , with r@xmath3223 , unless very heavily reddened , are more distant than 1  kpc if dwarfs . in this direction ( l=0@xmath3 , b=@xmath420@xmath3 ) , it is likely that we are seeing mostly evolved stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "consequently it is unlikely that there is any detectable , systematic motion of the comparison stars .",
    "the proper motion is consistent with the expectation that rx  j185635 - 3754 is a nearby neutron star .",
    "the proper motion is sufficiently large that accretion from the interstellar medium , which scales as v@xmath33 , produces negligable heating of the surface . in the blaes & madau ( 1993 ) formalism , accretion heating for a surface filling factor @xmath34=1 and an interstellar density n@xmath35=1",
    "cm@xmath33 can account for only about 1% of the observed luminosity of the star .",
    "the distance of 61 pc is small ; this is likely the nearest known neutron star to the earth .",
    "the distance is an important parameter to know well , since both the space velocity and the inferred radius scale with the distance .",
    "walter et al . ( 1996 ) claimed a firm upper limit to the distance of about 130  pc , based on the low x - ray absorption column of 1.4@xmath3710@xmath38  @xmath39 ( e@xmath40=0.02  mag ) .",
    "even though our analysis of the multi - wavelength spectrum ( an 2000 ; pons et al",
    ". , in preparation ) suggests a higher column of about 2@xmath3710@xmath38  @xmath39 , this is still comfortably less than that expected from the cra molecular cloud in this direction .",
    "however , a column of 2@xmath3710@xmath38  @xmath39 implies a mean interstellar density of 1  cm@xmath33 , which is substantially higher than the mean in the local ism .",
    "this would be worrysome , were it not for the fact that knude & h@xmath41 g ( 1998 ) show that substantial reddening exists in front of the cra cloud , with extinctions e@xmath40 of up to 0.1 for stars within 50  pc .    at this distance , the blackbody radius r@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) of the object is 3.3  km using the 57  ev temperature reported by walter et al .",
    "the x - ray and optical data are better fit by model atmospheres of heavy element composition ( an 2000 ; walter et al .",
    "2000 ; walter & an 1998 ; pons et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , with kt@xmath4449  ev and an angular diameter r@xmath42/d=0.18@xmath00.05 . in this case ,",
    "r@xmath42  =  11.2@xmath03.4  km .",
    "i caution that the inferred radius is model - dependent , and can not be considered a firm measurement until the surface composition is measured observationally from good - quality x - ray spectra .",
    "nevertheless , the radius suggests that we are indeed viewing the entire surface of the neutron star , and not just a heated polar cap .",
    "the proper motion of the neutron star provides clues to its origin .",
    "if the age is small enough one might hope to trace the star back to a plausible birthplace and place constraints on the possible progenitors and the evolutionary history of this neutron star . here",
    "the proper motion directs us back towards the sco - cen ob association , a source of supernovae during the past few million years ( de geus , de zeeuw , & lub 1989 ) , and the apparent birthplace of the runaway o star @xmath5  oph ( blaauw 1991 , 1993 ) . to clarify the relation , if any , of rx  j185635 - 3754 , the sco - cen ob association , and @xmath5  oph , requires running the space motions of these objects backwards through time .",
    "de zeeuw et al . ( 1999 ) catalog members of the upper sco and upper cen - lup associations , along with mean distances and radial velocities of the associations .",
    "i went back to the listings for the individual members in the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) , and confirmed the mean proper motions .",
    "de zeeuw et al .",
    "quote diameters of @xmath4414 and 27 degrees for the two associations .",
    "although the associations are almost certainly expanding and dispersing , i assume a constant radial extent in the analysis below .",
    "i take the parallax and proper motion of @xmath5  oph ( hd  149757 ) from the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "i adopt the radial velocity of @xmath49  km  s@xmath1 quoted in the hipparcos input catalog ( turon et al .",

    "van rensbergen et al . (",
    "1996 ) quote a peculiar velocity of 18  km  s@xmath1 with respect to the sco - cen ob association , apparently assuming a single radial velocity for the association . in light of the range in the radial velocities , and the difficulty of establishing the radial velocity of a hot star with such rapid rotation ,",
    "i adopt an uncertainty of @xmath05  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "i examine the space motions by converting all motions to heliocentric cartesian coordinates .",
    "uncertainties in the measurements are propagated through .",
    "i assume an uncertainty of 5  km  s@xmath1 in the radial velocity .",
    "uncertainties in the position due to space motions increase linearly with time , but the uncertainty on the location of the centers of the associations is dominated by their large radial extents .",
    "the kinematic parameters i used are summarized in table  [ tbl - input ] ; the space motions are shown in figure  [ fspm ] .",
    "blaauw ( 1991 , 1993 ) noted that @xmath5  oph appears to be moving directly away from the upper sco association .",
    "indeed , the space motion of @xmath5  oph takes it within 2.3@xmath015  pc of the center of the upper sco association 1.0  myr ago .",
    "this is well within the @xmath447@xmath3 ( 17  pc ) radial extent of the association at its distance of 140  pc . assuming a linear expansion with time",
    ", the cluster should have been only about 20% smaller at that time , so within the uncertainties @xmath5  oph either passed through or originated near the center of the upper sco association",
    ".    however , van rensbergen et al . (",
    "1996 ) have used stellar evolutionary arguments to suggest that @xmath5  oph is older , and originated in the upper cen - lup association .",
    "they note that the space motion of @xmath5  oph intersects the location of the upper cen - lup association 2 - 3 myr in the past . from age constraints , and by modelling the atmosphere of @xmath5  oph , van rensbergen et al .",
    "argue that it can not be a single star ejected from upper sco by gravitational encounters with other massive stars .",
    "they could not find a binary evolution scenario that produced a star like @xmath5  oph in less than about 9 myr , an age which greatly exceeds that of upper sco .",
    "they conclude it likely that @xmath5  oph was a binary in the upper cen - lup association , and that it was ejected from that association when its companion star became a supernova some 2 - 3 myr ago .",
    "the space motions of @xmath5  oph and the upper cen - lup association cast doubt on this scenario . the closest approach of the two",
    ", 27  @xmath0  22  pc at 2.1  myr , is only marginally consistent with origination within the @xmath4430  pc ( 13@xmath3 ) radius of the association today ( linear expansion suggests about a 25  pc radius at 2.1  my ) .",
    "note that the hipparcos parallaxes of @xmath5  oph and the two associations are virtually identical , while the radial velocities of the associations differ by about 9  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the radial velocity of @xmath5  oph is within about 5  km  s@xmath1 of that of upper sco , but is about 13  km  s@xmath1 less than that of the upper cen - lup association .",
    "if so , two million years ago @xmath5  oph would have been 30  pc further away from the sun than was the upper cen - lup association",
    ".    the @xmath49  km  s@xmath1 radial velocity of @xmath5  oph minimizes the closest approach to the center of the upper  sco association , while a radial velocity of + 5  km  s@xmath1 is required to bring the star with 5  pc of the center of upper cen - lup .",
    "it is unlikely that the radial velocity measurements will be this far off , so i conclude based on geometry alone that it is not likely that @xmath5  oph originated in upper cen - lup",
    ".      one can not be so definitive about the space motions of the neutron star , because its radial velocity is unknown and not easily measurable .",
    "rather , i look for plausibility that the neutron star originated in one of these associations , or as companion to @xmath5  oph . for the measured proper motion and parallax ,",
    "the neutron star comes within 18@xmath017  pc of @xmath5  oph at 1.0  myr and within 16@xmath012  pc of the center of the upper  sco association ( radius about 7  pc ) at 0.9  myr , for a radial velocity of @xmath4555 to 60  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the closest approach of the neutron star to the upper cen - lup association is 33@xmath012  pc at 0.9  myr , for a radial velocity of @xmath4545  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these distances are summarized in table  [ tbl-4 ] .    at 90% confidence , for a radial velocity of @xmath455 to @xmath460 km",
    "s@xmath1 , the positions of the neutron star , @xmath5  oph , and the center of the upper  sco association all come together between 0.9 and 1.0  myr ago . for no plausible combination of radial velocity and current distance do the ns , @xmath5  oph , and the center of the upper cen - lup association",
    "ever coincide within 90% confidence .",
    "it is unlikely that the spatial coincidence of @xmath5  oph , the upper sco association , and the neutron star some 1.0  myr in the past is a mere coincidence .",
    "given a neutron star at the position of rx  j185635 - 3754 , the likelihood that a random motion will cause it to coincide _ in projection only _ with the upper sco association ( @xmath447@xmath3 radius ) is about 0.007 .",
    "therefore i identify the neutron star as the possible remnant of the original primary of the @xmath5  oph system . that the temperature of the neutron star is close to that expected from the standard neutron star cooling curve at 1  myr",
    "may be further circumstantial evidence supporting this identification .",
    "rx  j185635 - 3754 is not the only neutron star moving away from the general direction of the sco - cen complex .",
    "the nearby pulsar psr b1929 + 10 ( psr j1932 + 1059 ) is another candidate for ejection from upper sco ( hoogerwerf , de bruijne , & de zeeuw 2000 ) .",
    "downes & reichley ( 1983 ) reported the proper motion .",
    "there are 3 available distances ( summarized by pavlov et al .",
    "1996a ) ; i adopt backer & sramek s ( 1981 ) lower limit of 250  pc .",
    "the spindown age is 3  myr .",
    "applying the same techniques used above , pulsar approaches to within 19@xmath030  pc of @xmath5  oph 1.0  myr in the past , and is 22@xmath027  pc from the center of the upper sco association at about the same time , if the pulsar is now at a distance of 250@xmath025  pc and has a radial velocity of 160  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "clearly this pulsar is also a possible candidate for a binary companion to @xmath5  oph , since the same arguments as put forth above for the chance coincidence apply .",
    "both can not be the companion .",
    "perhaps there was more than one supernova in a binary system in upper  sco about 1 million years ago .",
    "if rx  j185635 - 3754 is indeed the former companion of @xmath5  oph , then their space motions provide sufficient information to estimate the kick velocity of the neutron star .",
    "they are separating at an angle of 69@xmath3 . in the frame of the upper  sco association ,",
    "the space velocities of @xmath5  oph and the neutron star are 34  km  s@xmath1 and 104  km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "i assume that the velocity of @xmath5  oph was its orbital velocity at the time the supernova unbound the system .",
    "evolutionary models ( e.g. , van rensbergen et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that @xmath5  oph has a mass of 20 - 25  m@xmath46 .",
    "if the immediate progenitor of the supernova was a 4 - 5  m@xmath46 helium star , then the mass ratio would have been about 4 or 5 to 1 , with @xmath5  oph the more massive star .",
    "ignoring the momentum of the 3 - 4 m@xmath46 of material lost in the explosion , the remnant should have a space velocity directed anti - parallel to that of @xmath5  oph , with a speed higher by the mass ratio . to convert this into the observed space velocity of the neutron star requires a kick velocity of about 200 km  s@xmath1 directed 25@xmath3 from the direction of motion of @xmath5  oph .",
    "a lower initial mass ratio requires a lower kick velocity ; if the star that exploded was twice the mass of @xmath5  oph , the kick velocity is 90  km  s@xmath1 directed 60@xmath3 from the direction of motion of @xmath5  oph .",
    "rx  j185635 - 3754 is confirmed to be an isolated neutron star , at a distance of 61  pc , with a heliocentric space velocity of 108  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "it appears to have left the upper sco ob association between 0.9 and 1.0 million years ago .",
    "it may have been the binary companion of the runaway o star @xmath5  oph , which left upper sco at the same time .",
    "if so , the neutron star suffered a kick velocity of about 200  km  s@xmath1 amplitude at birth .",
    "reexamination of the space motions of @xmath5  oph and the sco - cen ob association casts some doubt on van rensenbergen et al.s conclusion that @xmath5  oph originated in the upper - cen - lup association .",
    "it is not clear how to reconcile their binary evolutionary scenarios with these geometric constaints .",
    "the existence of an old , isolated neutron star of known age permits one to place another point on the cooling curve , a point not contaminated by possible non - thermal emission .",
    "the exact temperature depends on the choice of atmospheric model , but in any event the luminosity lies near the fp ( friedman & pandharipande 1981 ) cooling curve at an age near 1  myr .",
    "the inferred radius of the neutron star depends on the angular diameter , which is model - dependent .",
    "the smallest angular diameter for a given temperature is given by a black body .",
