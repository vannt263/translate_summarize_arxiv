    "today s exponentially growing mobile data traffic is mainly due to video applications such as content - based video streaming .",
    "the skewness of the video traffic together with the ever - growing cheap on - board storage memory suggests that the quality of experience can be boosted by caching popular contents at ( or close to ) the end - users in wireless networks .",
    "a number of recent works have studied such concept under different models and assumptions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of existing works assume that caching is performed in two phases : _ placement phase _ to prefetch users caches under their memory constraints ( typically during off - peak hours ) prior to the actual demands ; _ delivery phase _ to transmit codewords such that each user , based on the received signal and the contents of its cache , is able to decode the requested file . in this work",
    ", we study the delivery phase based on a coded caching model where a server is connected to many users , each equipped with a cache of finite memory @xcite . by carefully choosing the sub - files to be distributed across users , coded",
    "caching exploits opportunistic multicasting such that a common signal is simultaneously useful for all users even with distinct file requests .",
    "a number of extensions of coded caching have been developed ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? *",
    "section viii ) ) .",
    "these include the decentralized content placement @xcite , online coded caching @xcite , non - uniform popularities @xcite , more general networks such as device - to - device ( d2d ) enabled network @xcite , hierarchical networks @xcite , heterogeneous networks @xcite , as well as the performance analysis in different regimes @xcite .",
    "further , very recent works have attempted to relax the unrealistic assumption of a perfect shared link by replacing it by wireless channels ( e.g. @xcite ) . if wireless channels are used only to multicast a common signal , naturally the performance of coded caching ( delivery phase ) is limited by the user in the worst condition of fading channels as observed in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the information theoretic limit , that is , the multicasting rate is determined by the worst user ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7.2 ) .",
    "however , if the underlying wireless channels enjoy some degrees of freedom to convey simultaneously both private messages and common messages , the delivery phase of coded caching can be further enhanced . in the context of multi - antenna broadcast channel and erasure broadcast channel ,",
    "the potential gain of coded caching in the presence of channel state feedback has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the key observation behind @xcite is that opportunistic multicasting can be performed based on either the receiver side information established during the placement phase or the channel state information acquired via feedback .    in this work , we model the bottleneck link between the server with @xmath1 files and @xmath0 users equipped with a cache of a finite memory as an erasure broadcast channel ( ebc ) .",
    "the simple ebc captures the essential features of wireless channels such as random failure or disconnection of any server - user link that a packet transmission may experience during high - traffic hours , i.e. during the delivery phase . in this work",
    ", we consider a memoryless ebc in which erasure is independent across users with probabilities @xmath2 and each user @xmath3 can cache up to @xmath4 files .",
    "moreover , the server is assumed to acquire the channel states causally via feedback sent by the users . assuming that users fill the caches randomly and independently according to the decentralized content placement scheme as proposed in  @xcite , we study the achievable rate region of the ebc with cache and state feedback . our main contribution is the characterization of the rate region in the cache - enabled ebc with state feedback for the case of the decentralized content placement ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "the converse proof builds on the genie - aided bounds exploiting two key lemmas , i.e. a generalized form of the entropy inequalities ( lemma 1 ) as well as the reduced entropy of messages in the presence of receiver side information ( lemma 2 ) . for the achievability",
    ", we present a multi - phase delivery scheme extending the algorithm proposed independently by wang  @xcite and by gatzianas et al .",
    "@xcite to the case with receiver side information and prove that it achieves the optimal rate region for special cases of interest .",
    "we provide , as a byproduct of the achievability proof for the symmetric network , an alternative proof for the sum capacity of the ebc with state feedback and without cache .",
    "more specifically , we characterize the order-@xmath5 capacity defined as the maximum transmission rate of a message intended to @xmath5 users and express the sum capacity in a convenient manner along the line of @xcite .",
    "this allows us to characterize the rate region of the symmetric cache - enabled ebc with state feedback easily , since as such all we need is to incorporate the packets generated during the placement phase  @xcite .",
    "however , such proof exploits the specific structure of the rate region of symmetric networks , and unfortunately can not be applied to a general network setting considered here .",
    "our current work provides a non - trivial extension of @xcite to such networks .",
    "furthermore , we show that our results can be extended in a straightforward manner to the centralized content placement @xcite as well as the multi - antenna broadcast channel with state feedback .",
    "finally , we provide some numerical examples to quantify the benefit of state feedback , the relative merit of the centralized caching to the decentralized counterpart , as well as the gain due to the optimization of memory sizes , as a function of other system parameters .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section :",
    "mainresult ] , we describe the system model together with some definitions and then summarize the main results . section  [ section : upperbound ] gives the converse proof of the achievable rate region of the cache - enabled ebc with state feedback .",
    "after a high - level description of the well - known algorithm by wang and gatzianas et al . in section  [ section :",
    "revisiting ] , section  [ section : achievability2 ] presents our proposed delivery scheme and provides the achievability proof for some special cases of interest .",
