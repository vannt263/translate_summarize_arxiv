    "the effect of temperature and angular momentum on pairing properties is an interesting subject in the study of nuclear structure . because of its simplicity",
    ", the bcs theory is often used , which offers a good description of pairing correlation in the macroscopic systems such as metallic superconductors .",
    "it predicts a collapse of the pairing gap at @xmath0 , which signals the sharp superfluid - normal ( sn ) phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "the bcs theory , however , ignores quantal and thermal fluctuations , which are significant in finite small systems .",
    "therefore , it needs to be corrected for the application to finite nuclei .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been proposed to study the effects of fluctuations on nuclear pairing  @xcite .",
    "their results show that , at zero angular momentum , thermal fluctuations smear out the sharp sn phase transition , resulting in a pairing gap , which does not collapse at finite temperature . in rotating nuclei ,",
    "a phenomenon of temperature induced pair correlations , which reflects the strong fluctuations of the order parameter in small systems , has also been predicted  @xcite .",
    "the recent microscopic approach , called the modified bcs ( mbcs ) theory  @xcite has shown , for the fist time , that the microscopic source causing the non - collapsing pairing gap is the quasiparticle - number fluctuation ( qnf ) .",
    "recently , we proposed the self - consistent quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( scqrpa )  @xcite , which includes the qnf as well as the quantal fluctuations due to dynamic coupling to pair vibrations .",
    "the purpose of present work is to extend this approach to finite temperature and finite angular momentum .",
    "the pairing hamiltonian is considered , which describes a system of @xmath1 particles interacting via a pairing force with the parameter @xmath2 and rotating with angular velocity @xmath3 and a fixed angular momentum projection @xmath4 on the laboratory ( or body ) fixed @xmath5 axis : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the operator that creates ( annihilates ) a particle with angular momentum @xmath9 , spin projection @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and energy @xmath12 . for simplicity , the subscripts @xmath9 label the single - particle states @xmath13 with @xmath14 0 ,",
    "whereas @xmath15 denote the time - reversal states @xmath16 .",
    "the particle number operator @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 is the @xmath20-projection of total angular momentum .",
    "the variational procedure is applied to minimize the expectation value of this hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the result yields the final equations for the pairing gap , particle number and total angular momentum , which include the effect of qnf in the form @xmath21 @xmath22~ , \\hspace{5 mm }         m = \\sum_k m_k(n_k^{+ } - n_k^{-})~ ,         \\label{nm}\\ ] ] where the quasiparticle energy @xmath23 and renormalized single - particle energy @xmath24 are given as @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the expectation values @xmath29 and @xmath30 are evaluated by solving a set of coupled equations , which contain the scqrpa @xmath31 and @xmath32 amplitudes .",
    "the qnf is given as @xmath33 , where the quasiparticle occupation numbers @xmath34 are found from the integral equations @xmath35^{2}+[\\gamma_{k}^{\\pm}(\\omega)]^2}d\\omega~ ,          \\label{nkcoupling}\\ ] ] with the mass operators @xmath36 obtained by solving the set of equations for double - time quasiparticle green s functions and those of a quasiparticle coupled with scqrpa pair vibrations .",
    "the quasiparticle dampings are given as @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the proposed approach is called the ftbcs1+scqrpa theory . neglecting the coupling to scqrpa , i.e. the factors @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", it becomes the ftbcs1 theory , which is different from the conventional ftbcs theory by the presence of the qnf .",
    "the violation of particle number at zero angular momentum is approximately removed by applying the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method .",
    "the corresponding approaches are called the ftln1+scqrpa and ftln1 .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out within the @xmath38 doubly degenerate equidistant model with the number @xmath38 of levels equal to that of particles , @xmath1 , as well as for @xmath39o , @xmath40ca , @xmath41fe , and @xmath42sn .",
    "the results obtained show that , at zero angular momentum , under the effect of qnf within the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) , the sharp sn phase transition predicted by the ftbcs theory is smoothed out . as the result ,",
    "the pairing gap does not collapse at @xmath43 , but has a tail , which extends to high @xmath44 .",
    "the dynamic coupling to the scqrpa vibrations significantly improves the agreement with the exact results for the total energies and heat capacities obtained for @xmath45 as well as those obtained @xmath41fe within the finite - temperature quantum monte carlo method  @xcite [ figs .",
    "[ fig ] ( a )  [ fig ] ( c ) ] .",
    "however , for heavy nuclei such as @xmath42sn , the scqrpa corrections are found to be negligible in comparison with the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) results .    for @xmath39o and @xmath40ca , the ftbcs1 pairing gaps , obtained at different @xmath4 , decreases as @xmath44 increases and do not collapses at high @xmath44 .",
    "at @xmath4 higher than the critical value @xmath46 , where the ftbcs gap for @xmath47 disappears , there appear thermally assisted pairing correlations , in which the ftbcs1 gap reappears at a given @xmath48 , and remains finite at @xmath49 [ fig .",
    "[ fig ] ( d ) ] .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by the qnf within the ftbcs1 theory . at @xmath47 ,",
    "the qnf is zero , so the ftbcs and ftbcs1 gaps are the same as functions of @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) , and both collapse at @xmath50 . however , with increasing @xmath44 , the ftbcs1 gaps , which are obtained at different @xmath44 , collapse at @xmath51 , and remain finite even at very high @xmath44 , whereas those given by the conventional ftbcs theory vanish at @xmath52 and @xmath53 [ figs .",
