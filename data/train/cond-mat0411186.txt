    "interestingly , the transition is of first order @xcite for @xmath7 with a second order end point at a @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "such a second order end point is also seen in the phase diagram of typical mott - hubbard systems like v@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the one - band hubbard model has been frequently used as a microscopic model for these materials ( see refs .   and , in particular , ref .   which focusses on the critical regime close to the second order end point ) .",
    "on the other hand , the justification to base the microscopic description on a one - band model ( see ref .  ) has been questioned recently@xcite .    for a proper description of materials such as transition metal oxides ,",
    "the orbital structure of the relevant electronic degrees of freedom has to be taken into account .",
    "this can lead to a fairly complicated form of the underlying tight - binding bandstructure ( the kinetic energy term acquires a matrix structure ) .",
    "furthermore , additional local coulomb matrix elements arise which describe the interactions between electrons in different orbitals .",
    "the simplest possible extension of the model ( [ equ : hubbard ] ) to the case of orbital degeneracy is the two - band hubbard model .",

    "the model in the semi - infinite chain form is then solved by iterative diagonalization . therefore , the major obstacle in applying the nrg to multi - band models is the dramatic increase of the hilbert space with each nrg step ( in each step , one additional site of the semi - infinite chain is included ) .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to use very large values of the discretization parameter @xmath22 so that the number of states can be reduced significantly .",
    "averaging over many discretizations ( the so - called `` z - trick '' ) has been shown to give reliable results for thermodynamic quantities ( see ref .  ) , even for large values of @xmath22 . however , this approach becomes at least cumbersome for the calculation of dynamic quantities which are required for the dmft self - consistency .",
    "here we adopt two different strategies which allow to use a small value of the nrg discretization parameter @xmath22 and to keep enough states in each step so that dynamic quantities can be calculated reliably .",
    "the first one is to explicitely include the orbital quantum number in the iterative construction of the basis states .",
    "this additional quantum number significantly reduces the typical matrix size , so that o@xmath23 states can be kept in each nrg iteration with reasonable computation time and memory consumption on modern smp high - performance computers like e.g.  the ibm regatta .",
    "the price to pay is that one has to omit the last term in the coulomb interaction , i.e. @xmath24 because it explicitely breaks the orbital symmetry .",
    "however , it turns out that this term does not influence the thermodynamics , and dynamic quantities are only slightly affected via the multiplett structure of the hubbard bands .",
    "the second strategy is an asymmetric truncation scheme : instead of adding both orbital degrees of freedom simultaneously , the hilbert space is truncated after adding each orbital individually .",
    "this also leads to a significant reduction of the hilbert space in the iterative diagonalization .",
    "however , the asymmetric truncation scheme does not guarantee that orbital symmetry is preserved during the nrg iterations .",
    "in fact , a slight violation of orbital symmetry is observed for very small energies , typically much lower than the kondo temperature .",

    "as expected from general @xmath53 arguments @xcite this local moment is eventually kondo screened with an _ enhanced _ kondo scale @xmath54 . as a technical sidemark",
    "let us point out that for @xmath48 , unlike finite @xmath55 , the asymmetric truncation does _ not _ work properly , leading to wrong results for @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the local moment regime .",
    "in the atomic limit , any finite @xmath58 leads to a spin triplet @xmath59 as ground state with moment @xmath60 and entropy @xmath61 .",
    "apparently , this situation is realized for intermediate temperatures for both @xmath28 and @xmath62 . at low temperatures ,",
    "this local triplet is again quenched by the conduction electrons like for an ordinary @xmath63 kondo effect . obviously , the two - orbital system has a considerably reduced low - energy scale @xmath64 , which in addition decreases strongly with increasing @xmath55 . at present",
    "we do not have a satisfactory explanation for this observation , but believe that it is related to the problem how spin-@xmath65 electrons screen a true @xmath59 object .",
    "a direct consequence of this substantial reduction of the low - energy scale for the application to the hubbard model is that critical interactions for an mit are also strongly reduced for finite @xmath55 ( see sec .",

    "the calculations were done with a discretization parameter @xmath25 and @xmath67 states kept after truncation . on the scale used in the main panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_full_j ] the kondo resonance for @xmath62 appears to be a vertical line , pointing to a strongly reduced kondo temperature , too .",

    "if one zooms into the region @xmath68 $ ] around the fermi energy ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_full_j ] ) , only the resonance for @xmath62 remains visible with an energy scale well below @xmath69 .",
    "this again confirms the result from the thermodynamic quantities , viz that with increasing @xmath55 an exponential reduction of the kondo temperature occurs .",
    "it is quite obvious , that such a reduction in @xmath64 will later manifest itself in a corresponding reduction of the critical @xmath39 for the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition within the dmft .",
    "let us point out that friedel s sum rule implies as usual the constraint @xmath70 .",
    "this constraint is fulfilled with high precision due to the calculation of the dos via the self - energy according to ref .  .",
    "a completely different picture is obtained for an ising - like exchange interaction in model ( [ equ : tbsiam ] ) , which is realized by replacing @xmath71 and neglecting the term @xmath72 in this case , the atomic ground state is doubly degenerate and consists of     and two values of the hybridization parameter @xmath40 .",
    "apparently , there exists a critical @xmath73 which separates a strong coupling fixed point ( @xmath74 ) from a local moment like behaviour ( @xmath75).[fig : compare_th],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the two states where two electrons with the same spin occupy different orbitals .",
    "in contrast to the full exchange we find that the properties change quite dramatically with the ratio @xmath76 , where @xmath40 denotes the hybridization width . in fig .  [",

    "we find the expected screening and corresponding formation of a fermi liquid at low temperatures .",
    "however , for small @xmath40 , this behaviour is replaced by the formation of a state reminiscent of a local moment with entropy @xmath77 and effective local moment @xmath78 .",
    "obviously , the neglect of the spin - flip terms in hund s exchange leads to a `` critical '' ratio @xmath79 separating strong - coupling from local moment behavior .",
    "we interpret this feature in the following way .",
    "for the full exchange interaction , spin - flip scattering as in the conventional @xmath63 case is presumably leading to a scenario similar to the standard kondo effect . for ising - like hund coupling @xmath55 , on the other hand , the atomic ground state consists , as already mentioned , of the two states where two electrons with the same spin occupy different orbitals .",
    "quite apparently , these two states can not be connected by low - energy processes like spin - flips , i.e.  the mechanism leading to the kondo effect is not present here . however , if the coupling to the band states is large enough such that the @xmath63 kondo temperature is larger than @xmath55 , the system can screen the spins for each orbital individually before the coupling @xmath55 locks the system into the states with @xmath80 , leading to the observed strong - coupling behavior at large @xmath40 .    presently , it is not clear whether the change in the impurity properties is connected to some quantum critical behavior like in the pseudo - gap model @xcite .",
    "the clarification of this question is of course of some interest in its own right and will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming publication .    .",

    "the typical structure is obtained .",
    "decreasing @xmath40 below @xmath73 completely changes the structure of the dos . instead of a kondo peak , we now find a structure with a pseudo - gap at the fermi energy .",
    "it is quite evident , that this `` criticality '' in the impurity model has profound effects on the mit in the dmft calculations for the hubbard model .",
    "theoretical investigations of multi - orbital hubbard models within dmft have already led to a better understanding of various issues such as the nature of the mott - transition as a function of orbital degeneracy @xcite and the structure of the spectral function in realistic treatments within the lda+dmft approach @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with the linear dependence for large @xmath82 found in refs .   and with the square - root dependence reported in ref .",
    "the inclusion of the hund s rule exchange coupling @xmath55 has been shown to significantly reduce the value of @xmath81 @xcite . in particular , a qualitative change from continuous for @xmath48 to discontinuous for any finite @xmath55 has been observed in ref .",

    "we have observed that the symmetric truncation scheme ( taking into account the orbital quantum number and negelcting the last term in the interaction ) leads to identical results for spectral functions , apart from some weak redistribution of spectral weight in the hubbard bands due to a different atomic multiplett structure .",

    "for constant @xmath102 , the numerical results are not decisive , and could be interpreted as both a small discontinuity at @xmath19 and a continuous approach with diverging slope . on the other hand ,",
    "a quite strong discontinuity at @xmath19 appears for an ising - like hund s coupling @xmath97 , signalling a rather strong first order transition in this case .",
    "the above results are in rough agreement with the l - dmft predictions @xcite , although there one observes a first - order transition also for smaller values of @xmath55 .",
    "the appearance of an unambiguous and rather strong first order transition for an ising - like exchange coupling shows that in this case the physics underlying the mott - hubbard transition is very different from the one for the rotationally invariant exchange interaction . as for the single impurity model",
    ", we believe that a transition between individually screened orbitals on the metallic side to a local moment regime enforced by the ising coupling on the insulating side occurs as soon as @xmath55 becomes of the order of the fermi liquid scale . depending on the details of the non - interacting dos ( its value at the fermi level and the band width ) and the values of @xmath39 and @xmath55 , this can lead in the worst case to a serious underestimation of @xmath19 and possibly an incorrect description of the behavior of physical quantities close to the transition .",
    "in this paper we presented first studies of the mott - hubbard transition in a two - orbital hubbard model within the dmft at @xmath66 using wilson s nrg .",
    "in addition to a standard nrg implementation using the orbital quantum number , we proposed an asymmetric truncation scheme which turns out to work rather well in both the two - orbital single impurity anderson model and the two - band hubbard model .",
    "as a first interesting result , we observed that for the particle - hole symmetric case a finite hund s exchange @xmath58 leads to a tremendous reduction in the low - energy scale @xmath64 .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the result for @xmath48 , i.e.  @xmath50 , where the behavior conventionally expected for an @xmath53 kondo model , viz @xmath109{t_{\\rm k}^{n=1}}$ ] , is found@xcite . at present , the precise theoretical reason for this rather unexpected strong influence of @xmath55 on @xmath64 is not clear .",
    "interestingly , it is also rather different from the case @xmath110 where we find a mild _ increase _ of @xmath64 with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "obviously , a detailed study of the physics of multi - orbital quantum impurity models has to be an important future aim .",
    "a completely different behavior occurs if one replaces the rotationally invariant hund exchange by an ising - like one . in this case",
    ", the levels of the atomic doublet with @xmath80 enforced by the ising coupling can not be connected by schrieffer - wolff type spin - flip processes .",
    "thus , the kondo effect can only occur for @xmath111 , while for larger @xmath55 the systems is locked into a local moment enforced by the exchange coupling .",
    "note that this interpretation also implies that in the strong - coupling phase the spins on each individual orbital will be screened separately , while for the rotationally invariant case a full @xmath59 system must be screened .",
    "the details of the quantum phase transition between strong - coupling and local moment phases have not yet been analyzed .",
    "however , in view of a possible relevance of an ising - anisotropy in the presence of crystal fields , a further investigation of this problem is certainly interesting .",
    "we also applied the nrg to the two - orbital hubbard model in the framework of dmft to investigate the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition at @xmath66 for the half - filled case .",
    "the major goal was here to eludicate the influence of hund s coupling on the mit and to investigate how the restriction to an ising - like exchange changes the nature of the mit .",
    "our results are in general agreement with previous ones.@xcite in particular , for finite @xmath55 quantities like the effective mass or @xmath44 show diverging slopes as @xmath112 , possibly even discontinuities as proposed by the l - dmft.@xcite    for an ising - like hund s exchange coupling the situation becomes qualitatively different .",
    "as can be anticipated from the behavior of the impurity model , the mit is strongly first order with clear jumps in the effective mass and @xmath44 .",
    "note that the former also implies a discontinuous vanishing of the quasi - particle peak at @xmath66 as one reaches @xmath19 .",
    "also the physics underlying this transition is quite different compared to the rotationally invariant case , reflecting the lack of spin - flip scattering processes connecting the two states @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the metallic phase with ising - like interaction will be characterized by individual screening of the spins on the two orbitals rather than a kondo screening of a total spin @xmath59 . note that this subtlety will most likely influence low - energy properties on the metallic side close to @xmath19 , but be less important for `` high - energy '' properties like magnetic or orbital ordering .",
    "it is clear , that the investigations presented here are merely a starting point to systematically study properties of multi - orbital impurity models or correlated lattice models within the dmft at @xmath45 using wilson s nrg .",
    "the major advantage of this method is obviously its unmatched ability to handle exponentially small energy scales and nevertheless provide reliable information on dynamics and thermodynamics even on high - energy scales .",
    "thus , at least for two - orbital models we are now in a position to systematically study their physical properties and address questions that are of fundamental interest for a realistic description of , for example , transition metal oxides but require local degrees of freedom beyond a simple one - band hubbard model .",
