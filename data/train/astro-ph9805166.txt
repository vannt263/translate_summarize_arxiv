    "radial variations in the abundances of elements within galaxies are well - established as providing important constraints on models of disk galaxy formation and evolution ( eg .",
    "pagel & edmunds 1981 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ; zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ( hereafter zkh ) ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ) .",
    "hii regions play a unique role in such studies because they yield relatively reliable elemental abundances from measurements of emission line intensities .",
    "the early work of searle ( 1971 ) and shields ( 1974 ) used observations of hii regions in spirals to establish the existence of negative radial gradients in the abundance of oxygen .",
    "subsequent work has shown that such gradients are a generic feature of disk galaxies , although the magnitude and the shape of the gradient , as well the characteristic abundance , are observed to vary considerably from galaxy to galaxy ( eg .",
    "vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ; zkh ) .",
    "unfortunately , most hii region abundance studies carried out to date have probed only the bright , easily - observed inner regions of galactic disks , lying at or within the classical optical radius , r@xmath2 ( defined by the b - band 25th magnitude isophote ) .",
    "it is well known , however , that disk galaxies have hi disks which extend to typically @xmath4 1.52  r@xmath2 ( eg .",
    "cayette et al 1994 ; broeils 1994 ) , and in some rare cases to @xmath4  3r@xmath2 ( eg . van der kruit & shostak 1984 ) .",
    "these outer regions are characterized by low hi columns , high gas fractions and long dynamical timescales and thus provide an opportunity to study star formation and chemical evolution in rather unique physical environments .",
    "indeed , the outer regions of disks have physical properties which are reminiscent of those thought to exist during the early stages of galaxy formation , as well as those in giant low surface brightness galaxies , such as malin 1 ( eg . pickering et al 1997 ) .",
    "studying the mean enrichment level , the shape of the abundance gradient and the amount of intrinsic scatter at fixed radius , in outer galactic disks will therefore forward our understanding of a broad range of astrophysical objects .",
    "furthermore , since the predictions of models of chemical evolution often diverge most strongly in the outer parts of galaxies , abundance determinations extending as far in the outer disk as possible are needed to discriminate between competing theories .",
    "only a handful of outer disk hii regions have measured abundances and , of these , very few lie at galactocentric radii significantly beyond the optical radius ( eg .",
    "garnett & shields 1987 ; garnett et al 1992 ; garnett & kennicutt 1994 ) .",
    "the bias of previous studies of hii regions to the inner disk has certainly been due in part to the lack of known hii regions lying at large radii .",
    "in the course of a large , deep , h@xmath0 imaging survey to search for and study star formation in the extreme outer regions of disk galaxies ( ferguson 1997 ) , we have discovered numerous faint hii regions in the low gas surface density ( n@xmath5  few  @xmath6  @xmath7 ) outer limits of several galaxies .",
    "these hii regions are typically small ( diameter  @xmath1  150500  pc ) and of low luminosity ( l@xmath8  @xmath1  110  l@xmath9 ) , and do not clump into the giant complexes which populate the inner disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "they are often observed to trace out narrow spiral arms , which are sometimes coincident with underlying hi arms and faint stellar arms ( @xmath10 2628 mag/@xmath11 ) .",
    "a study of the ongoing and past star formation in the outer disks of these galaxies and its implications for models of disk galaxy evolution will be presented elsewhere ( ferguson et al , 1998a , b ) .",
    "we present here the first results from a long - slit spectroscopic study to determine the chemical abundances in the extreme outer parts of nearby disk galaxies , using the emission line spectra of our newly discovered hii regions .",
    "this paper presents results for three late - type spiral galaxies , namely ngc  628 , ngc  1058 and ngc  6946 .",
    "these galaxies have particularly extended disks of neutral hydrogen and are amongst our best examples of galaxies with extreme outer disk star formation .",
    "a summary of their properties is presented in table 1 .",
    "chemical abundances for hii regions in the inner disks of ngc  628 and ngc  6946 have been derived by mccall , rybski & shields ( 1985 : hereafter mrs ) .",
    "chemical abundances have not been previously measured for hii regions in ngc  1058 , and we present here a study of both inner and outer disk hii regions in that galaxy .",
    "the typical h@xmath0 fluxes of the outer hii regions we have identified range from 170@xmath12  erg  s@xmath13  @xmath7 , which for reference is roughly 101000 times fainter than the usual hii regions in late type spirals which have previously been studied spectroscopically ( eg . mrs , zkh ) . our strategy was to first target the brightest outer disk hii regions in our sample .",
    "the data discussed here were obtained during november 1994 , using the kpno 4 m telescope and the rc - spectrograph + t2 kb .",
    "the t2 kb chip was run with a gain of 2e@xmath14/adu and readnoise of @xmath1 4e@xmath14 .",
    "we used a 2 x 300 slit with a single moderate - resolution grating ( kpc10-a ; 316 l / mm ) to cover the wavelength range of range 3600 - 7500 , with spectral resolution of @xmath1  7 .",
    "@xmath154363 line .",
    "such resolution was required in order to seperate the [ oiii ] @xmath154363 line from any scattered hgi @xmath154358 emission .",
    "unfortunately , we failed to detect [ oiii ] @xmath154363 at all and so switched strategies to a simpler observing mode . ]",
    "the grating was used in first order with an order - blocking filter ( wg345 ) to eliminate second - order blue light from below @xmath1 3200 .",
    "the seeing was typically 1.52 .",
    "of the three nights of our run , two nights were mostly clear , hampered only by light to moderate cirrus during the latter parts of each night , but the third night was completely lost . in this paper , we discuss only a subset of the data obtained during the november run , consisting of measurements of hii regions in the disks of ngc  628 , ngc  1058 and ngc  6946 .",
    "blind offsets were required for all of our target outer hii regions .",
    "these were derived from deep narrow - band images obtained using the kpno 0.9 m and lowell 1.8 m telescopes , and were based on either nearby bright stars or the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the images were astrometrically calibrated using a grid of stars measured on the digitised poss plates and are accurate to @xmath16  0.5 .",
    "individual exposure times were 30 min per region and we usually obtained 24 exposures per target region , depending on the faintness of the target .",
    "experience indicated that if no metal lines were detected in a single 30 min exposure , then there was negligible chance of obtaining useful data for abundance determinations by stacking additional exposures .",
    "most objects were observed at low airmass and we rotated the slit to parallactic angle whenever possible to eliminate the loss of blue light .",
    "we also attempted to position the slit in such a manner as to include as many hii regions as possible , but the small angular size , faintness and relative isolation of our outermost targets made this difficult .",
    "spectra of he - ne - ar lamps were otained before and after each object exposure , and we made multiple observations of standard stars from the list of massey et al ( 1988 ) .",
    "in figures [ 628ima][6946ima ] , we show continuum  subtracted h@xmath0 images of each galaxy with the target hii regions identified .",
    "table 2 lists the identifications , positions and properties of our sample of hii regions .",
    "the diameters and fluxes presented are approximate and are intended simply to illustrate the range in physical properties which exists within our sample . in particular , it is very difficult ( and subjective ) to assign sizes and fluxes to inner disk hii regions , which often are part of large complexes composed of many @xmath17cores. we have not corrected the fluxes and luminosities for the effects of internal extinction .",
    "most of the outer disk hii regions in our sample have luminosities consistent with their being ionized by only a few equivalent o5v stars , as calculated using the lyman continuum fluxes in vacca et al ( 1996 ) ; these estimates are strictly lower limits to the number of enclosed massive stars as the hii regions may well not be ionization bounded ( eg . see the discussion of the origins of diffuse ionized gas by ferguson et al 1996a , b ) .",
    "two inner disk hii regions from the sample of mrs are included in our sample in order to provide an external consistency check on our measurements .",
    "see ferguson.fig1.jpg    see ferguson.fig2.jpg    see ferguson.fig3.jpg",
    "preliminary data reduction was carried out using standard procedures .",
    "a dc offset was subtracted from each frame using the overscan region .",
    "bias frames and quartz lamp exposures were used to remove any residual structure in the dc offset and pixel - to - pixel gain variations respectively .",
    "dark frames were also obtained but the dark current was found to be negligible and the frames were not utilized in the analysis .",
    "exposures of the twilight sky were obtained to map out the illumination pattern along the slit , and flatten the data in the spatial direction .    one dimensional spectra were extracted with apertures ranging in size from 315 , depending on the seeing , and on the size and brightness of the object in question .",
    "the sky to be subtracted was selected from adjacent regions , and fit with a low order polynomial .",
    "an important step in the extraction process is mapping the location of the spectrum at each point along the dispersion axis . in the brightest hii regions",
    "observed , this @xmath17trace could be well  defined , and revealed only a small amount of distortion from the blue to the red , which was typically much less than the size of the extraction box",
    ". only a weak continuum , if any , was present in the outer disk hii regions however . in those cases where we could not trace the continuum along the entire dispersion axis , we chose to fit a low order polynomial anchored to the position of one of the brightest lines present .",
    "the individual extracted spectra were wavelength calibrated using he - ne - ar exposures , with the typical accuracy of the transformation being a few tenths of a pixel , or equivalently @xmath10.5  .",
    "flux calibration was carried out using observations of standard stars ( with the same slit width as our program objects ) , and the sensitivity functions showed residuals of only @xmath10.020.03 magnitudes ( after a zeropoint offset ) . at this point ,",
    "individual spectra of the same hii region were checked for consistency and then averaged together .",
    "spectra that had been dispersion corrected , but not flux calibrated , were also averaged for the purpose of computing uncertainties in the line intensities . in figure [ refspect ] , we present extracted , combined , calibrated spectra for 4 hii regions in ngc  1058 , which are representative of the typical spectra obtained in this study .",
    "inspection of the spectra reveals the presence of many emission lines .",
    "most prominent are the bright oxygen , nitrogen and sulfur lines , as well as the balmer lines of hydrogen . in addition , several hii region spectra show detections of fainter lines , such as those due to helium , argon , neon and in some cases neutral oxygen .",
    "we focus here on only those bright lines which lead to determinations of the oxygen and nitrogen abundances through the semi - empirical methods discussed below in section 4.2 .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured via gaussian fits to the line profiles .",
    "the logarithmic extinction at h@xmath18 , c(h@xmath18 ) , was derived from measurements of the balmer lines , using the equation @xmath19 where i@xmath20 is the intrinsic line flux , f@xmath20 is the observed line flux , and f(@xmath21 is the galactic reddening function normalized to h@xmath18 .",
    "the reddening function of seaton ( 1979 ) , was adopted , as parametrized by howarth ( 1983 ) , and assuming r = a@xmath22/e(b@xmath23v)=3.1 .",
    "intrinsic balmer line ratios were taken from osterbrock ( 1989 ) , assuming an electron density of n@xmath24=100 @xmath25 and an electron temperature t@xmath24=10@xmath26  k. the determination of the amount of underlying stellar balmer absorption is an important concern in the estimation of the required extinction correction .",
    "our data are of insufficient s / n to determine the absorption equivalent width directly , so we adopted the standard approach of assuming a correction of 2 to the measured equivalent width due to underlying stellar absorption ( eg .",
    "mrs ; oey & kennicutt 1993 ) , and we proceeded to derive the logarithmic extinction at h@xmath18 based on the h@xmath18 and h@xmath0 lines alone .",
    "we also corrected the forbidden - line / h@xmath18 ratios for the effects of underlying h@xmath18 absorption , but this is generally a small effect since most spectra have moderate to large h@xmath18 equivalent widths .",
    "formal errors in the derived line ratios were determined by summing in quadrature the statistical noise from the number of counts , the uncertainty in the continuum placement ( proportional to the width of the line times the rms in the nearby continuum , corrected for the effects of pixelization ) , and the uncertainty in the flux calibration .",
    "in addition , the error in the c(h@xmath18 ) term was accounted for when deriving extinction - corrected line ratios .",
    "tables 35 present the observed line intensities , both uncorrected and corrected for reddening and balmer absorption , as well as some relevant line - ratios for our sample of hii regions .",
    "formal errors on the quantities are indicated in parentheses .",
    "the @xmath17direct method for determining chemical compositions from nebular emission lines requires a knowledge of the electron temperature ( and density ) of the emitting gas in order to transform reddening - corrected emission line ratios to ionic abundance ratios , and finally to elemental abundances ( eg . osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the electron temperature t@xmath24 is commonly derived from the o@xmath27 ion , via the ratio @xmath28 \\lambda 4959+\\left[oiii\\right ] \\lambda 5007}{\\left[oiii\\right ] \\lambda 4363}=\\frac{7.73\\exp^{(3.29{\\times}10 ^ 4)/t}}{1 + 4.5{\\cdot}10^{-4}(n_e / t^{1/2})}\\ ] ] ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature sensitive [ oiii ] @xmath154363 line is typically very weak in extragalactic hii regions , and decreases in strength rapidly with increasing abundance ; as a result , this method is limited to only the hottest ( ie .",
    "most metal poor ) and brightest objects .",
    "the faintness of our outer disk hii regions , coupled with the low resolution of our spectroscopy , severely limits the detectability of this key diagnostic line .",
    "a marginal detection of [ oiii ] @xmath154363 was made in one of the individual spectra we obtained for the brightest outer disk hii region of our sample , 1058e , but the significance of the detection is low .",
    "it can be used only to place an upper limit on the electron temperature of the region , and hence a lower limit on the oxygen abundance .",
    "we measure [ oiii ] @xmath154363/h@xmath29  @xmath16  0.067 , which , when combined with measurements of the [ oiii ] @xmath304959,5007 lines , translates into an upper limit of 12,700k on the temperature in the o@xmath27 zone ( assuming @xmath31  =  100  @xmath25 ) , and a lower limit on the oxygen abundance of log(o / h )  @xmath324.07 ( both derived using the fivel program ( de robertis , dufour & hunt 1987 ) as implemented in iraf ) .",
    "as will be shown below , this limit is consistent with the abundance derived via the semi - empirical method .",
    "fortunately , in the absence of a reliable [ oiii ] @xmath154363 detection , there exist alternative methods for deriving nebular abundances which rely on observations of the bright lines alone ( eg .",
    "pagel et al 1979 , skillman 1989 , mcgaugh 1991 , thurston et al 1996 ) . empirical methods to derive the oxygen abundance exploit the inter - relationship between o / h , t@xmath24 and the intensities of the strong lines , [ oii ] @xmath153727 and [ oiii ] @xmath304959,5007 , via the parameter @xmath33",
    "\\lambda 3727+\\left[oiii\\right ] \\lambda\\lambda 4959,5007}{h\\beta}.\\ ] ] as o / h decreases , the cooling efficiency of the nebular gas drops because there are fewer metal ions , and as a result t@xmath24 increases .",
    "this leads to a substantial brightening in the 4959 and 5007 lines , and hence an increase in r@xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "as o / h increases , cooling becomes more efficient leading to a decrease in t@xmath24 .",
    "most of the cooling then occurs through the fine - structure ir lines at 52 and 88 , leading to a decrease in the strength of the optical [ oiii ] lines and therefore in r@xmath34 .",
    "these variations in [ oiii ] line strength can clearly be seen in the representative spectra shown in figure [ refspect ] , which are stacked in order of decreasing metallicity .",
    "this simple relationship between r@xmath34 and o / h gets complicated by the fact that at very low o / h ( @xmath1  30% solar3.07 and log(n / o)@xmath350.88 from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) . ] ) , the sheer lack of oxygen causes the bright lines ( and hence r@xmath34 ) to decrease as o / h decreases , due to the growing importance of ly@xmath0 cooling ( edmunds & pagel 1984 ) . as a result , while a single value of r@xmath34 can uniquely specify o / h over most of the range in metallicity , there is a turnover region ( 2050% solar ) where the relationship becomes double valued .",
    "there have been several calibrations of the o / h  r@xmath34 relationship over the past years , based on both observations of hii regions with known abundances and the results of photoionization models ( eg . edmunds & pagel 1984 , mrs , dopita & evans 1986 , skillman 1989 , mcgaugh 1991 , zkh ) . of particular importance for the present study",
    "is the calibration at the low abundance end ( log(o / h)@xmath363.8 ) , and in the turnover region ( @xmath233.4  @xmath4  log(o / h )  @xmath373.8 ) where a single value of r@xmath34 corresponds to two values of o / h .",
    "skillman ( 1989 ) and mcgaugh ( 1991 ) have illustrated the importance of accounting for the ionization state of the nebula in deriving an abundance estimate at low metallicities , however only the mcgaugh calibration takes explicit account of this ( see mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "mcgaugh s calibration has the further advantages that with it one can predict oxygen abundances on both upper and lower branches of the o / h  r@xmath34 relation , and also the volume averaged ionization parameter u , defined as @xmath38 where q is the ionizing photon luminosity , r@xmath39 is the radius of the strmgren sphere , n is the number density of the gas and c the speed of light .",
    "for these reasons , we have adopted this calibration here .",
    "several methods have been proposed by which to distinguish between upper and lower branches for objects with values of r@xmath34 which place them in the double - valued region .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1994 ) advocates the use of the [ nii ] @xmath156584/[oii ] @xmath153727 ratio , noting that it varies monotonically with o / h and that it is not very sensitive to the ionization parameter u since the two ions have similar ionization potentials .",
    "the division between upper and lower branches of r@xmath34 is fairly well - defined , with log([nii]/[oii])@xmath401 ( reddening  corrected ) indicating the upper branch and log([nii]/[oii])@xmath361 indicating the lower branch .",
    "another diagnostic which has been used in the literature is the value of the line ratio [ oiii]/[nii ] ( eg .",
    "skillman 1989 ) , with the transition between upper and lower branches occuring at log([oiii]/[nii ] )  @xmath1  2 . while this parameter also varies monotonically with abundance , it is sensitive to the ionization parameter and is thus of limited use in the low abundance regime where such effects are important .    in figure [ mg_grid",
    "] , we plot our hii regions on the model grid of log(o / h) logr@xmath34 from mcgaugh ( 1991 ) .",
    "one can clearly see the effect of the ionization parameter , u , in the turnover region and on the lower branch .",
    "all models converge towards a single upper branch , reflecting the fact that r@xmath34 is insensitive to u in this regime .",
    "as can be seen , our outer disk hii regions cluster around the @xmath17knee of the calibration .",
    "we have also overplotted a heterogeneous sample of hii regions which have oxygen abundances determined in the literature via the @xmath17direct method ( see section 5.2 for a discussion of this sample ) .",
    "the objects in this sample populate the same general region of the diagram as the hii regions in our sample . as will be discussed in detail below , comparison of the abundances determined via the @xmath17direct method and via the model calibration for this sample show very good agreement .",
    "thus , the mcgaugh calibration generally provides reliable abundance estimates for objects which lie in this region of the diagram .",
    "nitrogen to oxygen abundances ( n / o ) may be determined in the absence of a measurement of the strength of [ oiii ] @xmath154363 by the algorithm recently proposed by thurston et al ( 1996 ) , again requiring only observations of the bright lines [ nii],[oii ] and [ oiii ] .",
    "the relationship , which is based on the same premise as that of the relationship between oxygen abundance and r@xmath34 , is calibrated by the results of photoionization modelling . this calibration does not take account of the fact that , for oxygen abundances lower than @xmath1  25% solar , a non - unique relation exists between o / h and r@xmath34 .    in table 6",
    ", we list the derived oxygen and nitrogen - to - oxygen abundances for our sample , as well as the mean volume averaged ionization parameter , derived by our adopted techniques .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived metallicities are a combination of both measurement errors and the intrinsic uncertainties in the model calibrations .",
    "as we will show below , various tests reveal that the formal errors on the line strengths appear to underestimate considerably the actual uncertainties in the line ratios , and in the final derived chemical abundances , and thus are of limited use for understanding the intrinsic uncertainty in our abundance estimates .",
    "measurement errors can arise from a variety of causes , such as extraction , sky subtraction , varying sky conditions and profile  fitting .",
    "we investigated the magnitude of the measurement errors in our data by conducting a series of experiments .",
    "first of all , we compared the line intensity measurements as derived from two different techniques ",
    "gaussian fitting and direct integration under the line profile . defining the @xmath17mean fractional difference to be the result from either method minus the mean , divided by the mean , we find values of 1%  @xmath41  3% . while the mean fractional difference was greatest at the smallest fluxes , it is still less than 10% .",
    "next , we compared line strength measurements for those hii regions for which we had obtained multiple spectra ( that were subsequently combined ) . since multiple observations of a given hii region",
    "were always made consecutively , this comparison should not be influenced to a great extent by slit - positioning .",
    "considering only those lines which are well  detected , we calculate the mean fractional difference from multiple line measurements to be 8%  @xmath41  10% .",
    "fainter lines tend to show more scatter than strong lines , for example [ oiii ] @xmath154959 and [ nii ] @xmath156548 have mean fractional differences of @xmath1  15% .",
    "a conservative estimate of the uncertainties in the individual line strengths inferred from this comparison is @xmath41  10% , from which we expect uncertainties of @xmath1  15% in the line ratios .",
    "we also calculated the mean values of the ratios [ oiii ] @xmath155007/[oiii ] @xmath154959 and [ nii ] @xmath156854/[nii ] @xmath156548 for the hii regions in our sample .",
    "since these ratios have a fixed theoretical value , comparison of our sample average with the expected values provides an additional gauge of our measurement errors .",
    "considering again only those lines which are well  detected , we find @xmath42[oiii ] @xmath155007/[oiii ] @xmath154959@xmath43 2.88 with standard deviation 0.31 and @xmath42[nii ] @xmath156854/[nii ] @xmath156548@xmath43 2.96  @xmath410.39 , which compare favourably to the theoretical values of 2.88 ( nussbaumer & storey 1981 ) and 2.95 ( mendoza & zeippen 1982 ) respectively .    as a final check on measurement errors",
    ", we included in our sample two hii regions which were observed by mrs . despite the likely differences in pointings and aperture sizes employed",
    ", we find an excellent agreement in the values of r@xmath34 ; @xmath44  log(r@xmath34)=0.144 for fgw 628a ( mrs identification n0628(-074,-022 ) ) and @xmath230.068 for fgw 6946a ( mrs identification n6946(+182,+103 ) ) .",
    "these differences in r@xmath34 lead to differences of only @xmath230.08 and 0.07 dex in log(o / h ) , and @xmath230.16 and 0.08 in log(n / o ) .    in summary ,",
    "these various tests reveal that our measurement errors are small , and we conservatively estimate line ratios to be accurate to better than 15% , or @xmath10.1 dex .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in our results is without a doubt that due to the model calibrations of the semi - empirical relationships between line strength and elemental abundance . propagating the formal errors on the line strengths through the equations used to derive the abundances produces formal errors on the metallicities of only @xmath1  0.05 dex . as we will discuss below ,",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute value of the calibration is likely to be much larger than this .",
    "uncertainties in the calibration arise from the limitations in the inputs to the models used to construct the calibration , and from the ability of the calibration to reproduce model input data , and indeed to reproduce the values of chemical abundances which have been determined via a measurement of the electron temperature . as discussed by mcgaugh ( 1994 ) , while these uncertainties can have an important effect on the absolute metallicities derived , they have a much smaller impact on the relative values .",
    "one of the most important input parameters is the shape of the ionizing spectrum , which depends on both the mass and the metallicity of the ionizing stars ( mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1991 ) treats this problem by assuming a cluster containing several tens of ob stars is responsible for the ionization , which when averaged over , produces a constant ionizing spectrum , relatively insensitive to both the metallicities and individual effective temperatures of the enclosed stars , and hence the imf .",
    "we note however that many of our outer disk hii regions , if ionization - bounded , are consistent with ionization by only a few massive stars ( see table 2 ) and hence the assumptions which have gone into mcgaugh s calibration may not be entirely appropriate for the objects under study here .    concerning the ability of the calibrations to reproduce model input data , both mcgaugh(1994 ) and thurston et al ( 1996 ) report relative uncertainties of 0.10.2 dex over a wide range in metallicities .",
    "in the turnover region where r@xmath34 is double - valued , mcgaugh ( 1994 ) estimates uncertainties of @xmath4 0.2 dex , although as he points out they can not be too much larger than this since strong r@xmath34 guarantees that an hii region lies in the range",
    "3.4  @xmath45  log(o / h )  @xmath453.8 .",
    "thurston et al ( 1996 ) see increasing deviations from the output , relative to model input , at low metallicities , but their conclusion is based on tests with only two low metallicity models : at 30% solar the deviation is @xmath42 0.1 dex whereas it is @xmath10.3 dex for the lowest metallicity model tested , which has an oxygen abundance of 7% solar .",
    "perhaps the most robust measure of the accuracy of the semi - empirical technique is a direct comparison of predicted abundances with those measured for low metallicity hii regions which have published abundance determinations based on a measurement of the electron temperature .",
    "we have gathered from the literature a sample of low metallicity hii regions , in a heterogeneous set of parent galaxies , ranging from low metallicity dwarfs , including blue compact dwarfs ( eg .",

    "the radial abundance gradients are consistent with single log - linear relationships , although hints of interesting behaviour can been seen at large radii in two of the galaxies",
    ". there could be a flattening of the oxygen abundance beyond the edge of the optical disk in ngc  628 ( although this result largely hinges on the metallicity of the outermost hii region ) , as well as a steepening of the outer gradient in ngc  1058 .",
    "unfortunately , given the relatively large errors in our abundance determinations , as well as the relatively small size of the current sample , it is not yet possible to assess the significance of these features .",
    "similarly , it is not yet possible to constrain the amount of intrinsic scatter in the abundances as a function of galactocentric radius , which is of interest for understanding the efficiency and timescales for elemental mixing at large radii . while the two outermost hii regions in ngc  1058 show differences of @xmath4 0.2 dex in both o / h and n / o despite lying at very similar radii , a knowledge of the electron temperatures of these regions will be required before we can distinguish between real scatter and uncertainties inherent in the model calibrations .",
    "chemical evolution models predict a variety of different behaviours for galactic abundance gradients ( eg .",

    "some predict simple exponential declines while others produce steepenings or flattenings in the outer disk .",

    "both fich & silkey ( 1991 ) and vilchez & esteban ( 1996 ) found evidence for flat gradients in the nitrogen abundance beyond the solar circle ; additionally , vilchez & esteban ( 1996 ) found evidence for only a mild outer gradient in oxygen abundance , with outer values of @xmath1  20% solar , and outer disk values of n / o consistent with those measured in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "more recently , rudolph et al ( 1997 ) have re - examined outer abundance gradients using fir lines for a sample of 5 hii regions . when combined with the results of other studies",

    "they caution , however , that their present sample is not yet sufficient to rule out the possible existence of a flattening of the abundance gradient in the outer galaxy .",
    "they also find the variation of n / o throughout the galactic disk to be consistent with a step function , with a mean log(n / o ) of @xmath230.50  @xmath41  0.02 for r@xmath426.2 kpc and , @xmath230.83  @xmath41  0.04 for r@xmath496.2 kpc .",

    "on the other hand , the outermost hii region studied in m101 ( @xmath1 1.1  r@xmath2 ) has an o / h abundance of only 10% solar and an n / o abundance of 25% solar ; both n / o and o / h are observed to decrease more or less smoothly with increasing galactocentric radius across the disk ( garnett & kennicutt 1994 ) .",

    "lu et al 1996 , pettini et al 1997 ) .",
    "pettini et al ( 1997 ) calculate a column density - weighted mean metallicity of 1/13th solar for their sample of 34 dlas ( 0.7@xmath42z@xmath423.4 ) , using the zn lines which should be relatively unaffected by depletion onto dust .",
    "@xmath7 , which is several times higher than the typical hi column where our sample of outer hii regions reside ( a few times 10@xmath58  @xmath7 ) .",
    "] this comparison suggests an intriguing similarity in the mean chemical enrichment level of dla systems and present - day outer galactic disks , with dla systems being only slightly more metal poor .",
    "figure [ nooh ] shows a a plot of nitrogen - to - oxygen abundance as a function of o / h for our present sample of hii regions , as well as those inner disk regions from mrs .",
    "we have indicated where izw18 , the most metal poor gas - rich object in the local universe , falls on this diagram ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) .",
    "also shown are a set of n / si measurements ( or upper limits ) for a sample of 15 dla systems with z@xmath492 from lu et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors argue that n / si is equivalent to n / o , under the assumption that o / si is approximately solar in dla systems and that dust depletion is not significant .",
    "this plot reveals that while many dla systems in the lu et al sample are considerably more metal poor than present - day outer galactic disks , others are only slightly displaced from outer disks in terms of o / h and almost identical in terms of n / o . the long dynamical timescales ( @xmath110@xmath5910@xmath60  years ) which characterize the extreme outer disks imply that they evolve at a very slow rate but , nonetheless , we would expect them to have been more metal poor in the past than at the present epoch .",
    "we therefore conclude that while , on average , dla systems tend to be slightly more metal poor than outer galactic disks at present , the two were very likely indistinguishable at large lookback times .",
    "a major unsolved question is the importance of primary and secondary processes in the production of nitrogen .",
    "nitrogen is believed to be mostly a product of secondary nucleosynthesis , being produced via the cno cycle , however it is also thought to have primary component which can be produced in the earlier helium burning stages ( renzini & voli 1981 ) .",
    "it is thought that secondary nitrogen is produced by stars of a wide range of masses whereas primary nitrogen is produced by only intermediate mass stars ( 4  @xmath16  m / m@xmath55  @xmath16  8) ( renzini & voli 1981 , matteucci 1986 ) ; there is evidence however that nitrogen produced in massive stars is also predominantly primary . as an example , laird ( 1985 ) finds that [ n / fe ] is constant for solar - neighbourhood stars with -1.8@xmath61[fe / h]@xmath610.5 , implying that nitrogen and iron are produced in the same way , by the same stars . since it is well known that some iron is primary , and produced on short timescales by type ii supernovae from the core - collapse of massive stars ( eg .",
    "arnett 1995 ) , then one expects that such stars must also contribute to nitrogen production . the simple model for the chemical evolution of galaxies ( ie .",
    "closed box ) predicts that n / o will be independent of o / h for a primary origin of nitrogen , and proportional to o / h for a secondary origin ( see vila - costas & edmunds 1993 for a discussion , including the complication of @xmath17delayed primary production ) .",
    "the timescales for nitrogen production differ in stars of varying mass .",
    "if nitrogen is predominantly produced by massive stars , then there should be no time delay between the release of the element with respect to oxygen , and thus one expects the n / o ratio to exhibit only a small amount of scatter .",
    "if , on the other hand , most nitrogen comes from intermediate mass stars , then one expects a time delay of up to a few times 10@xmath59  years between the release of n / o .",
    "this is expected to introduce a large scatter in the n / o ratio at low o / h , decreasing with increasing metallicity as the effects of the time delay become less and less important ( eg .",
    "garnett 1990 ; pilyugin 1992 ) .    in figure",
    "[ nooh ] , we have overplotted the expectations for primary and secondary production of nitrogen , as taken from vila - costas & edmunds ( 1993 ) . at high metallicities ,",
    "the expected linear trend between o / h and n / o is seen , indicative of the dominant role of secondary nitrogen production . on the other hand ,",
    "the extreme outer disk hii regions are seen to populate the region bracketed by the pure secondary and primary + secondary curves , and thus appear consistent with a combination of primary and secondary production of nitrogen .",
    "the spread in n / o at fixed o / h in the outer disk may very well reflect the timescale between @xmath17bursts of star formation , produced perhaps by the passage of a spiral arm .",
    "further measurements , with improved accuracy , are needed to better understand these results .",
    "we have presented the first results from a systematic study of the physical properties and chemical abundances in a sample of newly - discovered , extreme outer disk hii regions .",

    "evidence is also found for diminished dust extinction at large radii , with the outermost hii regions having internal extinctions of a@xmath3  @xmath1  0 - 0.2 .",
    "electron densities in the outer disk hii regions are comparable to those found in the inner disk .",
    "the outer disk hii regions are observed to span a range in volume - averaged ionization parameter @xmath42u@xmath49 , and no correlation is seen with either galactocentric radius or metallicity .    by combining our sample of outer disk measurements with those for inner disk hii regions published in the literature",
    ", we have been able to probe the radial variation of both oxygen and nitrogen - to - oxygen abundances out to unprecedented radii .",
    "single log - linear relationships are found to adequately describe the radial abundance variations , although the derived slopes often differ considerably from those found if only inner disk hii regions are used to define the fit .",
    "the small number of hii regions in our present sample , together with uncertainties in the calibrations of the semi - empirical methods used here to determine abundances , limit the ability to constrain both subtle changes in the radial gradient as well as scatter in the outer disk .",
    "comparison of our outermost oxygen abundances with the predictions of the simple closed - box model for chemical evolution reveals a general consistency for two of the three galaxies , and suggests that the role of gas flows in the evolution of their extreme outer disks is comparable to that in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "an intriguing similarity is found between both the mean enrichment level and the nitrogen - to - oxygen abundance in outer disks and in some high redshift dla systems , implying that outer disks at the present epoch are relatively unevolved systems .",
    "while dla systems tend to be slightly more metal poor than present - day outer disks , they were very likely indistinguishable at large lookback times .",
    "finally , we have found that the outer disk hii regions in our sample are consistent with both primary and secondary production of nitrogen .",
    "a limitation of the current work is the reliance on semi - empirical methods to determine the abundances .",
    "a concern is that the outer disk hii regions under study here are physically different from the clusters of ob stars on which the model calibrations are based .",
    "a more complete set of photoionization models , extending to hii regions which are ionized by only a few massive stars , would be highly desirable .",
    "we are intending to measure the temperature - sensitive [ oiii ] @xmath154363 line , or at least place strong limits on it , for several of the brightest hii regions in the present sample , in order to compare the @xmath17direct and semi - empirical abundance determinations for these objects .",
    "we are also continuing to obtain measurements of additional hii regions in these galaxies , as well as extending our work to include several other galaxies , residing in a range of physical environments ( eg . field and cluster ) .",
    "the new generation of 8-m telescopes will significantly ease the task of measuring abundances for extreme outer disk hii regions , while future hst instruments will make it possible to routinely probe outer disk abundances via quasar absorption lines .",
    "a larger sample of outer disk abundances will make it possible to study the detailed nature of the abundance gradient at large radii , as well as the amount of intrinsic scatter at a fixed radius .",
    "ultimately , we will use our measurements of outer disk chemical abundances , along with our measurements of past and present star formation rates , in order to construct self - consistent models of outer disk evolution .",
