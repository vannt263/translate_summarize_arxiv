    "the one component plasma ( ocp ) model is one of the basic models in the condensed matter physics @xcite . besides of its direct astrophysical applications @xcite , to model the ionized matter in white dwarfs @xcite , outer layers of neutron stars and interiors of heavy planets @xcite , ocp is widely used as a reference model for a variety of systems , ranging from alkali metals @xcite to colloidal solutions @xcite .",
    "the application of the ocp is not restricted by classical systems ; it is also used when quantum effects are important @xcite .",
    "the ocp model is formulated as a system of point particles , interacting via the coulombic potential , which move in a uniform neutralizing background @xcite .",
    "all thermodynamic properties of the ocp depend only on the dimensionless plasma parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath6 is the charge of the particles , @xmath7 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 is the temperature ) and @xmath9 is the ion - sphere radius with @xmath10 being the concentration of particles ( @xmath11 is the number of particles , @xmath12 is the volume of the system ) .    for small values of @xmath2 , which correspond to a hot and/or dilute system , the debye - huckel theory accurately describes the thermodynamic properties of the ocp . for the excess free energy and internal energy this gives in the @xmath13 limit : @xmath14 abe expansion @xcite for the classical ocp provides next terms for that limit ( in the present study we consider the classical case ) :",
    "@xmath15    where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the euler s constant .",
    "the analytical abe expansion seems to be fairly accurate for @xmath18 up to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the next few terms for the @xmath13 expansion calculated in ref.@xcite allow to use the small-@xmath2 expansion up to @xmath20 .    for larger values of @xmath2 the ocp",
    "was studied numerically , by means of integral equations , such as percus - yevick , hypernetted - chain equations @xcite , and ( most successively ) by modified hypernetted - chain equation @xcite .",
    "extensive numerical studies have been performed by monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite technique . to fit available `` experimental '' data for the excess thermodynamic functions simple analytical fits",
    "were proposed @xcite :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "eqs.([ufit ] ) and ( [ ffit ] ) are fairly accurate for the interval @xmath27 @xcite , but unfortunately they do not give a correctly behavior at @xmath13 .",
    "pade approximants for the @xmath1 suggested in @xcite remedy the failure of ( [ ufit ] ) at small @xmath2 ; one thus obtains very precise description for the whole interval @xmath28 @xcite .    to describe the limit of very large @xmath2",
    "a perturbation theory was proposed @xcite ; it agrees well with the mc data for large @xmath2 , but also lack the proper small-@xmath2 behavior .",
    "the correct debye - huckel behavior at @xmath13 together with a reasonable @xmath29 accuracy for @xmath30 has been obtained in a simple semiphenomenological `` debye - huckel plus hole '' ( dhh ) theory @xcite ; it fails , however , for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "a modified dhh theory proposed recently @xcite using only one fitting parameter accurately reproduces the mc results for the large values of @xmath2 ( @xmath32 ) and demonstrates a correct behavior at @xmath13 .",
    "thus , up to now , no `` first - principle '' theory of ocp exists which describes accurately the thermodynamic properties in the whole range of @xmath2 from the debye - huckel limit @xmath13 up to @xmath3 limit , where the wigner crystallization @xcite occurs . in the present study",
    "we report a simple `` first - principle '' equation of state for the ocp which has the correct debye - huckel behavior for small @xmath2 and demonstrates a linear dependence on @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "it reproduces within @xmath33 accuracy the experimental data for the most of range of @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) and has a typical deviation of the order of @xmath35 ( with a maximal one @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows :  in the next sec.ii we consider the hubbard - schofield transformation that maps the ocp hamiltonian onto the ising - like hamiltonian and calculate the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian . in this section",
    "we also present the field - theoretical formulation for the statistical sum of the ocp which directly follows from the transformation used . within the gaussian approximation for the effective hamiltonian",
    "we derive the equation of state for the ocp . in sec.iii",
    "we discuss the equation of state obtained and compare the analytical results for the internal excess free energy with the available monte carlo data for the ocp . in the last sec.iv",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "we start from the ocp hamiltonian which may be written as follows ( @xmath38 ) :    @xmath39    where the first term in the right - hand side of eq.([hammic ] ) refers to the coulombic interactions , written in terms of the collective variables , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes coordinate of @xmath42-th particle , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the ideal - gas part of the hamiltonian .",
    "summation in eq.([hammic ] ) is to be performed over the wave - vectors @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , where @xmath48 are integers , @xmath49 , and the prime over the sum denotes that the term with @xmath50 is excluded  @xcite .",
    "the configurational integral may be then written in terms of the configurational integral of the reference ( ideal gas ) system @xmath51  @xcite as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the averaging over the reference system . in accordance with the hubbard - schofield scheme",
    "@xcite we use the identity ,    @xmath54 and arrive after some algebra at :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , and where the integration is to be performed under the restriction , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the complex conjugate of @xmath59 ) @xcite . applying the cumulant theorem  @xcite to the factor",
    "@xmath60 one obtains :    @xmath61    here @xmath62 denotes _ cumulant average _",
    "@xcite for the reference ideal - gas system . as it follows from eqs.([effham ] ) , @xmath63 is written in a similar way as the partition function for the magnetic system having the ising - like hamiltonian @xcite , where @xmath64 are the fourier components of the `` spin  field '' , @xmath65 .",
    "note that the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian ( [ effham ] ) are expressed in terms of the correlation functions of the ideal - gas system , which are perfectly known ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath66    this yields the effective hamiltonian :    @xmath67\\varphi_{{\\bf k } } \\varphi_{-{\\bf k } }   -\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty } \\frac{i^n \\omega^{1-\\frac{n}{2}}}{n ! } \\",

    "a simple structure of the effective hamiltonian @xmath71 , eq.([effham1 ] ) suggests a simple , closed - form field - theoretical formulation for the partition sum of the ocp , akin the sine - gordon representation of the coulombic gas @xcite , or the restricted primitive model of electrolytes @xcite .      using the space - dependent field @xmath72 @xmath73 it is easy to show that under this transformation the terms in eq.([effham1 ] ) containing products @xmath74 give rise to the terms @xmath75 , the terms @xmath76 give rise to the term @xmath77 , so that one can write    @xmath78\\ ] ]    and recognize the expansion of @xmath79 .",
    "integration over the fourier - components @xmath59 in eq.([effham ] ) converts into `` field''-integration over the field @xmath72 .",
    "it may be shown that the jacobian of this transformation does not depend on @xmath72 and appears as a normalization constant .",
    "noticing that @xmath80^{-1}\\ ] ] ( with the restriction @xmath81 ) and that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the so - called `` self - energy '' @xcite , one arrives after some algebra at the field - theoretical expression of the statistical sum @xmath84 of the ocp :    @xmath85\\right\\}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 denotes the `` field''-integration ,    @xmath87,\\ ] ]    @xmath88 is the inverse debye screening length and    @xmath89    here @xmath90 is the ideal - gas chemical potential ( @xmath91 is the thermal wavelength ) .",
    "deriving eq.([sgl ] ) we write the statistical sum of the ideal gas as @xmath92=   \\exp \\left\\{-\\beta \\mu_{\\rm i d } \\ ,",
    "\\rho \\int d{\\bf r } \\right\\}$ ] and rescale the length @xmath93 .    as it follows from eq.([sgl ] )",
    "the potential function of the effective field - theoretical hamiltonian for the ocp reads @xmath94 .",
    "this may be compared with the potential function @xmath95 of the sine - gordon model for the coulombic gas @xcite .",
    "note , that all imaginary terms in eq.([sgl ] ) vanish after the field integration due to the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian under the transformation @xmath96 .",
    "consider now the `` saddle - point '' approximation to the numerator in eq.([sgl ] ) .",
    "the equation for the `` extremal '' field which minimizes the effective hamiltonian reads :    @xmath97    under transformation @xmath98 eq.([pb1 ] ) converts into @xmath99,\\ ] ] which is the usual _ mean - field _ poisson - boltzmann equation for the ocp .",
    "this is not surprising since the `` saddle - point '' approximation is essentially the mean - field one .",
    "now we concentrate on the gaussian part of the effective hamiltonian and show that even neglecting the non - gaussian contribution to the effective hamiltonian , one can obtain fairly accurate equation of state for the ocp , provided that a correct value of the ultraviolet cutoff in the @xmath100-space is used .",
    "the gaussian approximation to @xmath71 corresponds actually to the random phase , or debye - hckel approximation , ( e.g.  @xcite ) . using @xmath68 , eq.([gauss ] ) and performing ( gaussian ) integration ( e.g.  @xcite ) over @xmath59 in ( [ effham ] ) , one easily finds for the excess free energy of the ocp :    @xmath101\\ ] ]",
    "we argue that the summation in eq.([fk ] ) should be carried out over a _ finite _ number of the wave - vectors @xmath100 . in this",
    "we follow the debye theory of the specific heat of solids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we assume that the total number of degrees of freedom in the system , @xmath102 , should be equal to the total number of _ physically different _ modes with the wave - vectors @xmath100 within the spherical shell of radius @xmath103 in the @xmath100-space .",
    "the number of modes is twice the number of the wave - vectors , since for each @xmath100 one has a sine and cosine mode ( the amplitude of the @xmath100-th mode is a complex number ) @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain :    @xmath104    where the factor @xmath105 appears when the integration in @xmath100-space is used instead of summation . from eq.([k0 ] ) follows that @xmath106 .",
    "a similar debye - like scheme to find the cutoff @xmath103 was first proposed for plasma in @xcite , where somewhat different value of the cutoff wave - vector was reported . using the @xmath103",
    "obtained we write :    @xmath107 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac94 \\int_0 ^ 1x^2dx \\left [ \\log \\left(1+\\frac{b\\gamma}{x^2 } \\right ) -\\frac{b\\gamma}{x^2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath108 .",
    "the last integral is easily calculated to obtain for the free energy @xmath109- \\frac{3}{2}\\left ( b\\gamma \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\arctan \\left (   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b \\gamma } } \\right ) \\nonumber \\label{result}\\ ] ] and for the internal energy : @xmath110 of the ocp . to obtain eq.([resu ] ) we use the relation @xmath111 .",
    "again we note that the same functional dependence for the excess internal energy ( but with different coefficients ) has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "as it follows from eqs.([result ] ) and ( [ resu ] ) , for @xmath13 the debye - huckel behavior is recovered . on the other hand in the opposite limit @xmath3 eqs.([result ] ) and ( [ resu ] )",
    "demonstrate the linear behavior on @xmath2 with the leading term @xmath112 in accordance with fits ( [ ufit ] ) and ( [ ffit ] ) to the mc data .",
    "the constant @xmath113 reads    @xmath114    which is fairly close to the constant @xmath115 of the fits ( [ ufit ] ) , ( [ ffit ] ) .    in fig.1 the excess internal energy given by eq.([resu ] ) is compared to the monte carlo data , taken from ref.@xcite for @xmath116 and ref.@xcite for @xmath117 .",
    "fig.2 shows the relative error of the analytical expression ( [ resu ] ) .",
    "as it follows from fig.1 and fig.2 the equation of state is fairly accurate in the most of range of the plasma parameter .",
    "the maximal deviation of the analytical expression from the numerical data occurs at the intermediate values of the plasma parameter , @xmath118 .    to analyze the reason of the enhanced deviation of the theoretical results from the numerical data at @xmath119",
    ", one can address the small-@xmath2 expansion of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it was observed @xcite that in spite of the correct debye - huckel limit , this does not reproduce correctly the next - order terms of the abe expansion ( [ abeu ] ) .",
    "this occurs due to limitations of the gaussian approximation for the effective hamiltonian .",
    "since all the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian are known , one can go beyond the gaussian approximation and develop a usual perturbation scheme , based on the gaussian hamiltonian .    .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    in particular the equation of state in a form of the virial expansion may be recovered @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this expansion does not provide the closed analytical expression for the excess thermodynamic functions , which may be used with acceptable accuracy for all the range of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , dealing with a problem where the relevant range of plasma parameter is not known in advance one should preferably use the simple closed - form equations suggested in the present study .",
    "a `` first - principles '' equation of state for the one - component plasma is derived that has a correct debye - huckel behavior at the limit of small plasma parameter @xmath2 and demonstrates a linear dependence on @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "the obtained coefficient @xmath120 at the linear leading term is close to the corresponding coefficient @xmath121 found in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the simple analytical expression for the excess internal energy reproduces the mc data within @xmath33 accuracy for the most of range of @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) and has a typical deviation of the order of @xmath35 ( with a maximal one @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 .",
    "helpful discussions with john valleau , george stell , werner ebeling , yaakov rosenfeld and jens ortner are highly appreciated .",
    "the author is thankful for torsten kahlbaum for providing some important references . financial support of nserc of canada is acknowledged .",
