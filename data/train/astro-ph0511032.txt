    "since the discovery of the first optical afterglow @xcite associated with a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , several robotic telescopes have been developed to perform rapid follow - up observations of grb afterglows .",
    "fast robotic follow - ups are now possible because of the improved localization of grbs provided by current gamma - ray satellites ( _ hete - ii _ ,",
    "_ integral _ , _ swift _ , _ interplanetary network _ ) ; real - time grb alerts are received from these satellites through the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) @xcite within a few seconds of the grb onset and provide positions with typical uncertainties of a few arcmin .",
    "observations within minutes of the grb can be crucial to determine the properties of the close circumburst environment , potentially providing clues to the nature of the progenitor .    to date",
    ", only a few grbs have measurements of their optical afterglow starting as early as a few minutes after the grb : 990123 , 021004 , 021211 , 030418 , 041006 , 041218 , 041219a , 050319 , 050401 , 050502a , 050525 , 050712 , 050713a , 050730 , 050801 , 050802 , 050820a , 050824 , 050904 , 050908 , 050922c , 051021a ( october 2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the early afterglow light curves for all of them within the first day after the burst .",
    "for each grb we collected unfiltered , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 observations .",
    "the liverpool telescope ( lt ) , owned and operated by liverpool john moores university ( ljmu ) , has a 2-m diameter primary mirror , altitude - azimuth design , final focal ratio f/10 . it was designed and built by telescope technologies limited , with the robotic control system and instrumentation being provided by the ljmu astrophysics research institute @xcite .",
    "it is situated at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , on the canary island la palma . due to the fully opening enclosure and to the fast slew rate of 2@xmath8/s ,",
    "the telescope can start observations within 13  min of the receipt of the gcn alert notice .",
    "lt has five instrument ports : four folded and one straight - through , selected by a deployable rotating mirror in the ag box within 30  s. the telescope is equipped with the _ ratcam _ optical ccd camera , and with the _ supircam _ 12.5  @xmath9 m camera . a _",

    "when a grb fulfills all the requirements to be observed with the lt , the grb over - ride mode is triggered . the grb program takes control of the telescope and triggers the so - called `` detection mode '' ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] ) , during which a small number of sloan @xmath0-band short - exposure images are taken .",
    "these images are then transferred to the lt proxy machine , a network - attached on - site computer . the automatic lt grb pipeline , called _ liverpool telescope transient rapid analysis pipeline _",
    "( hereafter _ lt - trap _ ) , is then invoked to process , analyze and interpret these images and returns a value to indicate whether any variable optical transient ( ot ) candidate has been identified .",
    "the result of this analysis drives the automatic selection of the subsequent observing mode as follows :    * identification of a fading ot with @xmath13  @xmath14 multi - color imaging mode ( sec .

    "the grb target of opportunity control agent ( grb toca ) is a shell script that is invoked in response to a grb alert being received at lt via a socket connection .",
    "this script uses the toca of the lt robotic control system ( rcs ) to take control of the telescope , provided that the grb position is observable and other requirements are fulfilled , e.g. :    * the positional error circle is sufficiently small ( error radius @xmath16  arcmin ) ; * altitude above horizon is @xmath17 ; * the position does not match any known x - ray catalog source ; * in the case of _ swift _ alert , the image significance should not be low ( to - date , no real grb was found to have the low image significance flag raised ) ; * none of the five known soft - gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , sgr  1900 + 14 , sgr  1806 - 20 , sgr  1627 - 41 , sgr  0526 - 66 and sgr  1801 - 23 , lies in the error circle .    as noted above , the average delay between the arrival time of the gcn alert and the start time of observations ranges between 1 and 3  min .    in the case of an sgr lying in the error circle ,",
    "the grb toca triggers a sgr follow - up ir observation with the _ supircam _ according to the strategy defined in an sgr follow - up approved proposal led by the lt grb group . currently , the automatic sgr follow - up program is still under test , so the presence of an sgr in the error circle merely invalidates the grb follow - up observation .",
    "when all of the above conditions are fulfilled , the grb toca repoints the telescope , then triggers the acquisition of the first set of images scheduled in the detection mode ( following commissioning of ringo ( 2006 ) , the detection mode exposures will be preceded by an initial short polarimetric exposure ) .",
    "the _ lt - trap _ is then invoked to analyze these images and consequently choose the most suitable observing strategy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] for a detailed description ) .",
    "the ringo exposure will be analyzed offline at a later time and plays no part in real - time decision making ; the motivations of this choice are explained in section  [ sec : pm ] .",
    "the grb toca and the _ lt - trap _ communicate through the noticeboard , which is a plain text file continuously updated until the end of observations .",
    "this not only reports in real time a detailed chronological sequence of all the actions and results acquired through , following technical conventions , but also represents a useful real - time human - readable interface for the users responsible for monitoring the on - going observation sequence .",
    "the dm consists of a sequence of two sets of three 10-s exposure images taken in @xmath0 .",
    "these are the first images of the grb field acquired by the telescope .",
    "once each set has been acquired and copied to the proxy machine , the grb toca invokes the grb astrometric fit script on each image .",
    "after object extraction and comparison with standard catalogs , an ot candidates list is extracted for each set of three images .",
    "these ot candidates are then processed by the grb variability script , which aims to identify sources common to each image set and evaluate possible variability .",

    "3 .   the retrieved catalog image is then cropped to match exactly the field of view of the lt .",

    "however , this is not relevant , as the purpose of the script is to establish relative variations , regardless of the absolute values . to account for possible variations in the zero point",
    ", the script adopts the following approach : it calculates the root mean square deviation of the three zero points and adds it in quadrature to the statistical error of each of the three magnitudes .",
    "after the dm has completed its imaging and analysis sequence , the appropriate observation mode is triggered automatically on the basis of the results of the analysis performed by the _ lt - trap _ on the dm images ( see fig .",

    "the motivation for changing and optimizing the filter choice ( post may 16 ) was threefold : 1 ) the greater sensitivity at @xmath36 band , 2 ) the small separation between @xmath38 and @xmath7 filter central wavelengths ( @xmath39     and @xmath40   , respectively ) and 3 ) the recognized need for denser sampling of the light curves at early times .      a key unsolved problem in the astrophysics of grbs is the geometry of the ejecta and the role of magnetic fields .",
    "direct measurements of polarization at _ early times _ provide stringent constraints on current jet and internal shock models .",

    "remarkably , in spite of the opposite cases of variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 either totally unrelated or totally anticorrelated , the results seem to give consistent confidence intervals , as shown by fig .  [",

    "the wide confidence interval of @xmath64 is understandably due to the low number of to observed so far , rather than the limits of the _ lt - trap_. we expect to give more precise estimates of both probabilities as soon as the sample of grb afterglows detected is more numerous .",

    "this latter case is also notable for longer term follow - up using the _ robonet-1.0 _ network .",
    "the other case of prompt detection is grb  050713a @xcite , although in this case the afterglow was not identified automatically because of the poor quality of the images affected by the presence of a @xmath106 star in the field , but recognized afterward by visual inspection .",

    "<S> these images are reduced , analyzed and interpreted automatically using pipeline software developed by our team called `` _ lt - trap _ '' ( _ liverpool telescope transient rapid analysis pipeline _ ) ; the automatic detection and successful identification of an unknown and potentially fading optical transient triggers a subsequent multi - color imaging sequence . in the case of a candidate brighter than @xmath1 , either a polarimetric ( from 2006 ) or a spectroscopic observation ( from 2007 ) will be triggered on the lt . if no candidate is identified , the telescope continues to obtain @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 band imaging with increasingly longer exposure times . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a detailed description of the _ lt - trap _ and briefly discuss the illustrative case of the afterglow of grb  050502a , whose automatic identification by the lt just 3 min after the grb , led to the acquisition of the first early - time ( @xmath41  hr ) multi - color light curve of a grb afterglow . </S>"
