    "gravitational lenses offer a unique possibility to determine cosmological distances and hence the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "the method avoids using any form of distance ladder and is almost independent of a deeper understanding of astrophysical processes .",
    "this has the advantage that possible statistical and systematic uncertainties can be controlled much better than with other methods . besides the measurement errors of redshifts , positions and time delays , the most important source of uncertainties in using gravitational lenses to determine @xmath2 is the mass model of the lens .",
    "constraints provided by observational data are never sufficient to fix the mass distribution uniquely @xcite .",
    "simple parametric models , based on the knowledge about typical galaxies in the local universe or desired mathematical properties , are normally used to overcome this difficulty .",
    "this approach , while leading to consistent results , has the disadvantage of hiding the underlying uncertainties and making it difficult to quantify them .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a family of mass models with separable radial and angular dependence of the potential .",
    "external perturbations are included as an external shear . in this way",
    ", the different parts can be studied independently . for the radial dependence , we choose a simple power - law and are especially interested in the influence the radial slope has on the results .",
    "several authors @xcite have found approximate scaling relations of @xmath7 for spherical models with external shear . the same dependence was found before by @xcite for doubles in spherical models without shear ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the work of @xcite showed , that the radial slope also has important effects in non - parametric models . due to the very general nature of these models",
    ", no exact scaling law could be found for them .",
    "we follow an intermediate approach by using an arbitrary function only for the angular part .",
    "the models include elliptical mass distributions and potentials as well as other shapes .",
    "it has been observed in several lens systems , that the external shear required to fit the data with simple elliptical models is much higher than expected .",
    "this might indicate a kind of asymmetry of the galaxy that can not be accounted for by elliptical models . the general angular part of the potential we use can describe this ` internal shear ' more accurately than simple parametric approaches .",
    "we extend and generalize the work of @xcite by including the three independent time delays in quadruple systems as constraints for the models .",
    "we do not use magnification ratios for several reasons .",
    "one is the observational problem of reliably measuring correct flux ratios .",
    "fluxes are influenced by microlensing and extinction .",
    "these effects can be very strong in the optical and in some cases they are still significant for radio wavelengths .",
    "the other reasons are related to our formalism and will be discussed later .    with this approach , we can derive explicit solutions for the hubble constant as a function of the observables , the power - law exponent @xmath8 , and the external shear .",
    "we use the results to find a simple but rigorous scaling law describing the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath8 in lenses with quadruple images .",
    "this scaling law of @xmath10 is also valid for more special parametric power - law models within the allowed range of @xmath8 and is therefore inherent to these models and not an artefact of the general angular dependence we discuss .",
    "the qualitative effect of this scaling law is easily understood when comparing it with the @xmath11 scaling discussed before and with the mass - sheet degeneracy , which leads to @xmath12 . in all cases ,",
    "a shallower density profile ( larger @xmath8 or @xmath13 ) leads to smaller values of @xmath9 .",
    "the flat part of the density distribution ( @xmath13 in the mass - sheet degeneracy ) amplifies the deflection angles but leaves the time delays unaffected . to fit the given geometry , the total deflection angles have to be constant , therefore the time delays ( @xmath14 ) decrease .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the external shear on the time delays and the measured hubble constant .",
    "if the shear is changed , the internal asymmetries of the mass distribution have to be adjusted to compensate for the changes .",
    "the total effect of these two contributions will be described by the new concept of a ` critical shear ' @xmath15 .",
    "the measured hubble constant is a linear function of the external shear and becomes zero for @xmath16 .",
    "we will present a simple interpretation of the critical shear in terms of the image geometry .",
    "the main goal of this work is to investigate the uncertainties in measurements of @xmath2 or cosmological parameters from time delays in gravitational lenses .",
    "the combination of distances that can be determined not only depends on the redshifts and @xmath2 but also on the other cosmological parameters ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 in standard cosmology ) and the smoothness of the mean density distribution ( ` lumpiness ' parameter @xmath19 ) .",
    "the results will also help in minimizing possible errors , either by selecting lenses with the least uncertainties or by using constraints of the model parameters which are lensing - independent .",
    "finally , we apply the formalism to several known lens systems , with and without measured time delays , to compare our analytical results with those from numerical model fitting using parametric models . for 2237",
    "+ 0305 , we compare with own numerical models and find a very good agreement even though the time delays are not used as constraints in this case .",
    "our results can be used directly to determine @xmath2 from time delays without explicit modelling but should not be used as a substitute for it .",
    "they are rather meant to provide an explanation for the degeneracies and scaling relations that have been found for several families of lens models .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the direct application to real systems is possible .    in the appendix",
    ", we discuss possible einstein rings in our family of models . interestingly ,",
    "infinitely small sources can be mapped as elliptical rings for arbitrary values of the external shear .",
    "the ellipticity of these rings is directly determined by the shear .",
    "for the lens equation and deflecting potential @xmath20 , we use the following notation : @xmath21 we use a power - law approach with a general separable angular part for the main lensing galaxy . @xmath22",
    "this family of models includes both elliptical mass distributions and elliptical potentials with arbitrary radial mass index @xmath8 . in the following , we assume all image positions as known . for the chosen model ,",
    "this implies also the knowledge of the position of the galaxy centre itself , because coordinates are relative to this centre .",
    "later we will see , however , that some of the equations are translation invariant , leaving the results unchanged when shifting the galaxy .",
    "the limiting cases of @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to a point mass and a density constant in the radial direction , respectively . between these two ,",
    "the isothermal models are another special case with @xmath1 .",
    "the normalized surface mass density of the general model is @xmath25 here and in the rest of this paper , primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "a very simple relation holds for the radial derivative of the potential which we will need in the time delay equations later : @xmath27    to account for nearby field galaxies or the contribution of a cluster , we include an external shear plus an additional constant mass density or convergence @xmath13 into our models . this @xmath13 can not be determined from observations as a consequence of the so called mass - sheet degeneracy , first discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we therefore always use a fixed @xmath13 .",
    "we parametrize the shear as follows : @xmath28 with this definition , @xmath29 points in the direction of the external perturbing mass or equivalently in the opposite direction .",
    "note that this part of the potential is a special case of the power - law with @xmath24 .",
    "the light travel time @xmath30 for a certain image at @xmath31 can be calculated for arbitrary lens models by using the equation @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are angular size distances of the deflector and the source from the observer , while @xmath35 is the distance of the source measured from the deflector .",
    "we separate this equation as usual into one part depending only on cosmology ( without @xmath2 ) , the contribution from the hubble constant , and a lens dependent part .",
    "this is done by using reduced distances @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 ) that only depend on the cosmological parameters ( and the redshifts ) but not on @xmath2 itself .",
    "we now use a scaled version of the hubble constant , @xmath38 which includes the cosmological factors and will later be determined by the lensing effect .",
    "this @xmath39 is directly proportional to the hubble constant itself when the cosmology is fixed . for two images @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we get a time delay of @xmath42 with @xmath43 by using the lens equation , we can transform this expression into a linear functional of the deflecting potential and its derivatives .",
    "mixed terms like @xmath44 for @xmath45 can be eliminated , so that the resulting time delay can again be written as the difference of the light travel times @xmath46 themselves . @xmath47",
    "although it is not immediately noticeable , this equation still is invariant under translations of coordinates . to prove this , one has to apply the lens equation .    for the special potential we discuss here , the relation , which also holds for @xmath48 with @xmath24 , can be used to eliminate the derivatives of the potential and obtain a simple expression only depending on both parts of the potential at the image position : @xmath49 we retain using the notion of light travel times for each image instead of time delays _ between _ the images to keep the equations simple .",
    "the @xmath46 are defined except for an overall additive constant that gets absorbed into the constant @xmath50 .",
    "the last equation was already presented in @xcite for the special cases of @xmath1 including external shear and for the general shearless power - law model .",
    "before solving the equations , we want to discuss how many parameters of the model can at most be determined from observations of lens systems with @xmath51 images , especially @xmath52 .",
    "see table  [ tab : parameters ] and [ tab : constraints ] for a list of parameters and constraining equations .",
    "as the time delays do not change when adding the same constant to all @xmath46 , we have to include the constant @xmath50 as parameter and thus have @xmath51 constraints with one parameter for this .",
    "we might as well have used only the ( uniquely defined ) @xmath53 time delays without @xmath50 .",
    "both possibilities result in @xmath53 more constraints than parameters just for the time delays .",
    ".parameters for the chosen family of models for a system with @xmath51 images .",
    "the @xmath54 are needed in the lens equations . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     even for systems with 4 images of one source , it will be impossible to determine all parameters .",
    "we therefore decide to fix @xmath8 in the following calculations so that the results can be used to study the dependence of @xmath55 on the radial mass slope .",
    "we will see that , with fixed @xmath8 , all equations stay linear .",
    "another critical parameter is the external shear , which seems to be higher than expected in many detailed lens models .",
    "fixing @xmath56 for the moment , we will be able to investigate the influence of any uncertainties in the external shear .",
    "in the special case of @xmath1 , it will even be possible to determine @xmath57 from the constraints , because a number of other parameters do not contribute then .",
    "we do not include fluxes or magnifications , because they would provide only @xmath53 constraints ( the independent flux ratios ) and at the same time add @xmath51 more parameters ( the second derivatives of the angular part of the potential at the image positions @xmath58 ) .",
    "the effect , that models get less constrained , when more observations are included in the analysis , is of course unknown in normal parametric models , where the number of parameters is fixed .",
    "our models have an infinite number of parameters , of which only a finite subset is needed to compare with observations .",
    "the number of relevant parameters can change when we include more constraints .",
    "another reason ( besides the difficulties in determining fluxes already discussed ) is that , in contrast to deflection angles and time delays , magnification ratios are non - linear functionals of the lensing potential , complicating the equations considerably .",
    "to exploit the information given by the image positions , we have to insert the power - law potential with shear into the lens equation .",
    "the derivative of the galaxy part of the potential can be obtained most simply by rotating its polar form to cartesian coordinates using the transformation matrix @xmath59 written in a form to take into account the role of @xmath57 , @xmath60 and @xmath54 as unknowns of the equations , this leads to the following equation .",
    "@xmath61 it is easily seen , that this set of @xmath62 equations can be used to determine @xmath60 and @xmath54 , assuming @xmath57 as known : @xmath63",
    "we now use to express the galaxy potential in the time delay equations .",
    "we decide to use the light travel times themselves rather than the @xmath2-independent time delay ratios as constraints . in this way",
    "we can keep the equations linear and the analysis much simpler . as a result ,",
    "the following set of equations is obtained for @xmath64 : @xmath65 the most interesting fact , besides the linearity , is the simple way the mass index @xmath8 appears in the equations . by combining information from the time delay and lens equations the way we did ,",
    "it was possible to remove the terms with @xmath8-dependent exponents .",
    "now @xmath8 only contributes in the scaling factors of the unknown parameters .",
    "having solved the system for one value of @xmath8 , we immediately find the general solution by scaling @xmath55 , @xmath66 and @xmath50 with the appropriate factors .",
    "in the case @xmath1 , the equations obviously degenerate with respect to the source position @xmath66 .",
    "it is then impossible to constrain the latter , but the same information can now be used to determine the external shear . in this case , the inclusion of the lens equations to determine the parameters @xmath60 of the galaxy potential was not really necessary , because @xmath67 does not contribute to the time delay equations",
    ". we can now directly invert the latter or to obtain solutions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the transition from exactly isothermal to nearly isothermal models deserves some attention . even for models with @xmath8 differing only slightly from unity",
    ", @xmath57 is a free parameter , while it is fixed by the observational data for @xmath1 .",
    "an incorrect external shear for almost isothermal models is usually compensated for by diverging source positions and @xmath60 and @xmath54 , leading to unrealistic models .",
    "it therefore seems appropriate to use the correct isothermal shear even for models that do not exactly obey @xmath1 .",
    "however , one has to take into account possible measurement uncertainties that introduce errors into @xmath69 .",
    "especially the time delays , which all contribute to the solution , can introduce significant uncertainties .",
    "in the general case with @xmath70 , can be solved directly to determine @xmath39 for a given shear @xmath57 . even without writing the explicit solution , we see , that @xmath71 for some constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the hubble constant scales with @xmath74 and is a linear ( but not proportional ) function of the shear .",
    "notably , the isothermal model plays no special role in this equation , despite the fact that , strictly speaking , @xmath57 can not be chosen freely in this case .",
    "as the isothermal shear is usually only weakly constrained due to the limited measurement accuracy , we may , however , use different values of @xmath57 even for @xmath1 .",
    "this is always true when the constraints we used here are not all available . considering this",
    ", one might well apply equation regardless of the value of @xmath8 .",
    "as the hubble constant is linear in @xmath57 , there has to be a one - dimensional family of values of the shear with vanishing @xmath39 .",
    "the shear with the smallest absolute value from this family will now be called the ` critical shear ' @xmath15 .",
    "if we denote the shearless value with @xmath75 , we can write the effect of external shear as @xmath76 if @xmath57 and @xmath15 point in the same direction , this scaling factor can be written as @xmath77 which is analogous to the scaling of @xmath78 for an additional mass sheet @xmath79 with critical density @xmath80 . the critical shear does not dependent on @xmath8 or the time delays @xmath46 and can be calculated from the image positions alone .",
    "if an upper bound of @xmath81 can be assumed , this translates to a range of @xmath82 the critical shear is thus a measure for the amount of external shear that can change @xmath55 significantly .",
    "the larger it is , the smaller the influence of uncertainties in the shear on the determined hubble constant .",
    "shear in the direction of @xmath15 contributes maximally , in a perpendicular direction the influence vanishes . with the ` direction of shear ' , we mean in this context the orientation @xmath83 of the vector @xmath57 .",
    "this is _ not _ the direction of @xmath29 towards the perturbing mass , cf .",
    "external field galaxies located perpendicular to the direction of maximal effect change @xmath55 by the same amount but with opposite sign .",
    "there are , however , four directions where external masses do not contribute .",
    "see section [ sec : special cases ] for actual numbers of the critical shear in real observed lens systems .",
    "( arrow ) and values of @xmath57 for which @xmath84 ( straight line ) .",
    "note that the direction of @xmath57 is @xmath83 and _ not _ the direction to the perturbing mass @xmath29 . ]    for constant light travel times or @xmath85 , equation describes an ellipse whose axes @xmath86 and @xmath87 are related to the external shear by @xmath88 for @xmath89 , this becomes a hyperbola .",
    "the position angle of the minor axis is the same as that of the perturbing mass responsible for the shear ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this means , that each ellipse / hyperbola passing through all images corresponds to a value of @xmath57 with @xmath84 .",
    "according to equation , for these values @xmath90 holds .",
    "the values of @xmath57 for all these conic sections span the complete subspace for which @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gammac ] ) .",
    "the critical shear is the smallest of these values and can therefore be calculated with equation for the ` roundest ' ellipse passing through all images . in figure",

    "the light travel time is the same for all parts of such rings as fermat s theorem requires . in our consideration , the potential is only constrained at the image positions and arbitrary in other directions .",
    "the einstein ring may therefore break up and form a number of discrete images with still vanishing time delays ( see appendix ) .",
    "surprisingly , most of the quantities we determined do not depend on the position of the lens centre .",
    "a shift of the centre is equivalent to adding a constant displacement to the vectors @xmath91 and @xmath66 .",
    "if we look at the general set of equations , we see that such a shift adds terms linear in @xmath91 and a constant to the equations .",
    "the constant term can be absorbed in @xmath50 and ( for @xmath92 ) the linear terms in @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath50 and @xmath66 are of no interest , the equations do not change when applying this shift .",
    "this means , that @xmath39 and the critical shear are translation invariant and can be determined even if the lens position is not known .",
    "this is only true for the family of models we analyse here .",
    "simple parametric models usually only fit the data for a specific position of the lens centre .",
    "for spherical models , the equations are overdetermined .",
    "there are nevertheless systems , which can be fit accurately with this kind of model .",
    "it can be shown , that @xmath93 becomes zero for @xmath23 to cancel the vanishing denominator in and ensure a finite @xmath94 .",
    "it can also be shown , that @xmath57 is parallel to @xmath15 for arbitrary @xmath8 .",
    "taken together , this means that for point mass models , we always have @xmath16 . the geometrical interpretation can be used to determine the direction of external shear for spherical models without calculations .",
    "it is given by the orientation of the minor axis of the roundest ellipse passing through all images .",
    "for the systems discussed below ( and for point mass lenses ) , even the absolute value of @xmath56 can be determined from this ellipse .    for systems , where the @xmath51 images are all located very close to the einstein ring at @xmath95",
    ", we can recover another scaling relation . in this case",
    ", the power - law can be interpreted as a local approximation to _ any _ radial mass profile , like softened power - law spheres or other models .",
    "we assume , that one fitting reference model is known .",
    "it is then possible to find a family of other models which are also consistent with the observations .",
    "this was done numerically by @xcite and led to a scaling of @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite presented a simple interpretation of this fact in terms of the well known mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite .",
    "if we multiply the lens equation @xmath97 with @xmath98 , we get another lens equation with the source position and lensing potential ( or deflection angle ) scaled with the same factor , plus an additional constant convergence @xmath13 .",
    "this means , that lens models given by the deflection angles @xmath99 and @xmath100 are equivalent , but source positions , time delays , etc .",
    "are scaled by @xmath98 in the latter model .    ) reference model is shown solid , the transformed model dashed and the final equivalent power - law model dotted . ]    as reference model , we choose an exponent @xmath101 .",
    "this model is now transformed as just described and then approximated locally near @xmath95 by a modified power law with exponent @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wuref ] illustrates this idea . for the new exponent , we find @xmath102 as time delays , source position and external shear all scale with @xmath98 , we find the general scaling laws @xmath103 for an arbitrary mass index @xmath8 .",
    "the time delay ratios do not change .",
    "with @xmath16 for point mass systems , the shear for arbitrary @xmath8 becomes @xmath104 , leading to a ratio of the hubble constants for the spherical and shearless case of @xmath105 the two models differ significantly for a realistic range of @xmath8 .",
    "one of the interesting properties of equation is the very simple dependence of the results on @xmath8 .",
    "the determined value of the hubble constant @xmath55 simply scales with the factor @xmath74 .",
    "the most alarming fact is , that this factor does not depend on the geometry of the lens , the time delay ratios or the amount of external shear .",
    "when using the models described here to determine @xmath2 from lens time delays , the error due to the assumption of an incorrect @xmath8 will be exactly the same for all lens systems as long as the real @xmath8 is more or less equal for all lensing galaxies .",
    "@xcite numerically found a scaling of @xmath74 in the case of a power - law model without external shear for orthogonal image pairs ( @xmath107 ) , while these computations lead to @xmath11 for opposed images .",
    "in contrast to their work , we have used all time delays as constraints so that they can not scale differently .",
    "the common scale factor of all time delays shows as a scaling of @xmath55 in our calculations .",
    "the reader might feel as uneasy about the seemingly diverging time delays or @xmath55 in the limit @xmath23 as the author did .",
    "this limit is equivalent to point mass models and one should not observe diverging time delays for this kind of lens .",
    "the point causing trouble here is the fixed external shear in our considerations .",
    "to fit the data with a point mass model , the shear has to be equal to the critical shear @xmath15 . taking this into account ,",
    "the result gets multiplied by a vanishing @xmath108 which cancels the @xmath109 factor .",
    "if we now change the shear by a small amount , the potential and thus @xmath55 will immediately diverge in the limit of small @xmath8 .",
    "this has no direct physical implications , because the mass models will become extremely unphysical to compensate for the shear effect .",
    "small relative differences in the @xmath60 , that will be introduced by an incorrect shear , will lead to enormous asymmetries in the mass distribution .",
    "this is related to the fact , that realistic compact mass distributions can provide only almost spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "any multipole moments would radially decrease more rapidly than the monopole term and must be very strong to have any effect .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail for a special case in section  [ sec : einstein symmetry ] .    for spherical systems with images near the einstein ring , we confirmed the approximate scaling of @xmath96 .",
    "this seems to be incompatible with the general scaling law of @xmath110 at first sight . with the factor of @xmath111 from equation , by which the shear changes the result in spherical models , these two results are , however , in perfect agreement",
    "to illustrate the results , we have presented here , and to test their relevance for real lenses , we want to apply the formalism to systems with a special einstein cross like symmetry and to some of the known real systems that are either useful to actually determine @xmath2 ( 1115 + 080 , 0911 + 0551 , 1608 + 656 ) or are interesting because they are very well studied systems like 2237 + 0305 .",
    "the calculations will show , that both scaling relations ( @xmath96 and @xmath112 ) are relevant for the determination of @xmath2 from time delays .",
    "the detailed numerical models for 2237 + 0305 will furthermore show , that the scaling also applies if the time delays themselves are not used to constrain the models .",
    "all time delays scale almost exactly as predicted by our analytical work .",
    "we will also see that parametric models may fit only for a limited range of @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling relations are then valid only within this range .    besides the effects of the exponent @xmath8 , the possible strong effects of any external shear",
    "will also be confirmed by the numerical models .",
    "a rather special example of systems shall be discussed explicitly in this section .",
    "we consider a lens with time delays @xmath113 and the following image positions : @xmath114 from these data , we immediately conclude @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath116-component of the shear does not contribute at all and can not be constrained .",
    "the equation determining the hubble constant now reads @xmath117 with the critical shear @xmath118 the special symmetry makes it possible to choose any value of external shear even for isothermal models .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to exactly reproduce the data with spherically symmetric models plus external shear . in this case",
    ", the shear is uniquely defined : @xmath119 the time delay equation now becomes somewhat more complicated than in the non - spherical case .",
    "to first order in @xmath120 , it reads @xmath121 comparing this with , we recover the factor of @xmath5 between the spherical and shearless case .",
    "both models fit the data exactly and , in this special case , the models are even compatible with highly popular elliptical mass distributions .",
    "that means that without any independent information about the external shear ( or equivalently the ellipticity of the galaxy itself ) , we have a factor of two uncertainty even when only considering these two simplest models for @xmath1",
    ". the real situation may be even much worse , when we consider models with internal _ and _ external shear . in this case , any small unknown contribution of external shear of the order of @xmath122 ( which for very symmetric systems becomes arbitrarily small ) will change the result significantly .",
    "@xcite discussed exactly the same type of systems with spherical models plus shear . with @xmath56 fixed , they also derived a scaling law of @xmath74 ( see their equation 8) .",
    "when the shear is constrained by the lens equations , the scaling changes to the @xmath11 form .",
    "we finally want to discuss the consequences of diverging time delays in the fixed shear case for @xmath23 due to equations and . for simplicity , we assume @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , but the argument is generally also true for other values . we write the potential as a multipole expansion terms might be included as well but they would not change the density on these axes , which is what we are interested in . ]",
    "@xmath126 to be compatible with equation , the coefficients have to meet the condition @xmath127 we notice , that densities can become negative near the axes . to minimize the angular density contrast , we have to keep only the monopole and quadrupole terms and set all higher coefficients to 0 .",
    "the potential is then equivalent to a density of @xmath128 which is everywhere positive only for sufficiently high values of @xmath8 . when using realistic mass models , we can therefore expect a lower bound for @xmath8 to achieve acceptable fits",
    "this applies not only to this special symmetric lens system but is true in general .",
    "numerical models presented in the next section will confirm this result for @xmath129 ( see figure  [ fig : timdel 2237 ] ) .",
    "this lens is not usually taken into consideration when thinking about determination of @xmath2 , because the time delays are expected to be very small and can therefore not be determined easily . here",
    "we show that even if all three time delays were known exactly , constraints for the hubble constant would still be very weak .",
    "the degeneracy caused by the unknown mass index @xmath8 was already discussed by @xcite for spherical models plus external shear .",

    "real lensing galaxies usually are elliptical and also embedded in an external shear field .",

    "the fact , that @xmath143 does not vanish is a confirmation of the degeneracy involving shear and ellipticity already discussed by @xcite .",
    "the effective number of parameters is therefore smaller then the formal one . because we notice the ellipticity changing only slightly with @xmath8 , a scaling like that in the spherical case",
    "is expected .",
    "this can indeed be seen in the plot , where the time delay scales with @xmath11 .",
    "contrary to the spherical case , @xmath57 does not scale proportional to @xmath11 but is additionally shifted by a constant offset .",
    "this is due to the fact that part of the shear has been transformed to ellipticity .",
    "we conclude , that both scaling laws for @xmath55 or the time delays can be relevant , depending on the family of models used .",
    "in the case of 2237 + 0305 , however , the influence of external shear is stronger than the effect of @xmath8 for any realistic values of the latter .",

    "all these authors agree on the importance of taking the effect of a nearby galaxy group into account .",
    "our formalism includes this group as an external shear of the order @xmath149 .",

    "@xcite showed , that the residuals do not change much for ranges of @xmath150@xmath151 . with our general family of models , the effect of unknown external shear",
    "can be quantified by using the critical shear and equation . to calculate @xmath4",
    ", we only need image positions relative to an arbitrary reference centre",
    ". the uncertainty in the galaxy position , which is usually much higher than in the image positions , does not affect the result . using the hst observations from @xcite with their claimed accuracy of @xmath152 as a basis for monte carlo simulations , we obtain a critical shear of @xmath153 .",
    "although the ground based positions from @xcite are not compatible with the hst results within the formal error bars , the critical shear from these data is about the same , @xmath154 .",
    "this means , that any shear of the order 0.1 can change the results for @xmath2 significantly .",
    "as the uncertainties in @xmath56 are of this order of magnitude , large effects on @xmath55 result even for fixed @xmath8 .",

    "the external shear is only weakly constrained , but seems to be of the order 0.1 .",
    "we have to stress , that this result includes all possible isothermal models with arbitrary angular dependence and is thus much more general than elliptical mass distributions .",

    "the external shear in the best - fitting model is @xmath162 and points almost exactly in the direction of a nearby cluster of galaxies .",
    "the redshift and velocity dispersion of this cluster was measured by @xcite to @xmath163 and @xmath164 . from this",
    ", they derive an absolute shear of @xmath165 using a sis model for the cluster .    to compare with lens models",
    ", we have to use the reduced shear @xmath166 , because the convergence @xmath13 caused by the cluster was not taken into account explicitly .",

    ", @xmath168 holds and we obtain @xmath169 .",
    "this measurement is not in good agreement with the model from @xcite .",
    "the reduced shear differs by about 0.2 , the direction of the two being almost identical .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of a second galaxy close to the main lens that might change the potential considerably .",
    "it is also possible that the internal asymmetry of the main galaxy itself can not be described as an elliptical mass distribution .    to estimate the uncertainty in time delays or the hubble constant derived from them",
    ", we use again the critical shear which is @xmath170 or @xmath171 .",
    "even with this very large critical shear , the uncertainty in the real @xmath56 has significant effects , because it is large as well .",
    "this system is the first and up to now only quad for which all three independent time delays have been measured @xcite .",
    "this offers the unique possibility to apply our method to a system providing the complete set of constraints .",
    "hst images show a main lensing galaxy but also a weaker second galaxy between the four images @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless apply the method to b1608 + 656 , if only to see if the effect of a secondary lens can be detected in this way , e.g.  by pretending there is a very large external shear .",
    "data for the positions of the images and the main lensing galaxy were taken from @xcite .",
    "the formal accuracy of the image positions is extremely high , of the order 212@xmath172arcsec . for the monte carlo simulations",
    ", we used 1mas scatter in each coordinate to account for possible shifts by local density fluctuations , caused for example by globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we can use the general equation to determine the hubble constant for shearless models . with the redshifts of @xmath173 and @xmath174 and standard einstein - de  sitter cosmology ,",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath175 for @xmath1 .",
    "the critical shear is @xmath176 . for isothermal models ,",
    "equation predicts a shear of about @xmath177 , depending on which hst image is used to determine the galaxy position .",
    "the result for the hubble constant is @xmath178 .",
    "the enormous differences in both @xmath2 predictions is a consequence of the large external shear @xmath179 .",
    "no external shear at all is needed to fit the data when including the influence of the second galaxy in the field .",
    "the models in @xcite even predict velocity dispersions for both galaxies which are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this is surprising , since the secondary galaxy is much weaker in all bands in the optical images .",
    "we used a very general semi - parametric lens model approach to study the changes of time delays and the determined hubble constant with the assumed radial density slope , quantified by the radial mass index @xmath8 . by using only linear constraints",
    ", it was possible to keep all the fundamental equations linear .",
    "this made the study of the @xmath8 dependence easy .",
    "for fixed external shear in quadruple lenses , this resulted in the simple scaling law @xmath180 , independent of the lens geometry , the time delay ratios or the external shear .",
    "this means , that a systematic error in the assumed @xmath8 will have exactly the same effect on all lenses and will not show as scatter in the results .",
    "the good agreement between @xmath2 measurements from different lenses @xcite should therefore not be taken as evidence for an accurate determination of @xmath2 .",
    "it merely shows , that all lensing galaxies seem to have more or less the same @xmath8 .",
    "in nearly isothermal models , a systematic error of only 10  per  cent in @xmath8 will result in an error of about 20  per  cent in the deduced hubble constant . to compare the results from lensing not only with each other but also with results derived from other methods ,",
    "this possible source of error has to be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , it is important not only to be aware of this effect , but to try and obtain better constraints on the radial mass profile .",
    "possible ways to do this include modelling lenses with multiply imaged extended sources to obtain constraints for the lensing potential at a wide range of distances to the lens centre .",
    "lenses with multiply imaged point sources can constrain the models only at a small number of radii . this should be done not only for systems with measured time delays , but for as many applicable lenses as possible to acquire reliable _ measurements _ of @xmath8 for a representative sample of lenses .",
    "another possibility is the detailed study of the dynamics of lensing galaxies or of other ( usually low redshift ) galaxies to learn more about the range of realistic galaxy mass profiles and use the results of this analysis to produce more realistic models for the lenses .",
    "we also quantified the effect of external shear by introducing the concept of a ` critical shear ' @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of @xmath56 on @xmath2 is linear and strongest in the direction of @xmath15 . for a fixed direction ,",
    "its amount is proportional to @xmath181 .",
    "the shear has to be exactly critical to fit the observations in point mass lenses .",
    "the value of @xmath15 can be found in a geometrical way .",
    "it is given by the ellipticity of the roundest ellipse passing through all images .",
    "for @xmath16 and non - vanishing @xmath8 , the time delays @xmath9 become zero .",
    "this is also true for a whole family of models which are represented by the less symmetric ellipses fitting the images . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the relation to possible einstein rings which are exactly given by these ellipses .",
    "the effect of shear is also the clue in understanding the compatibility of the general scaling law with the simpler one of @xmath182 for spherical models . in the latter models ,",
    "the shear is constrained by the observational data and changes @xmath55 by a factor of @xmath5 when compared to shearless models . in cases where spherical models are able to fit the data , the allowed range of @xmath56 results in an uncertainty of @xmath55 always covering both models .",
    "this may in certain cases only apply for a limited range of @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , the value of the critical shear and the hubble constant in the general model ( with fixed shear for @xmath2 ) do not depend on the position of the lensing galaxy .",
    "this may be of use for systems where this position can not be determined accurately .",
    "when using more general models or less constraints than in our calculations , the scaling laws still apply .",
    "they are only valid for a subset of the possible models then and one would have to expect even larger uncertainties when using the whole set .",
    "this also applies for lenses with less than four images .",
    "more special models on the other hand , like parametrized elliptical power - law models , may be able to constrain the range of possible results much better .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling laws still apply for the range of models that are compatible with the constraints . even in these cases ,",
    "our results may be used to determine @xmath2 without explicit modelling .",
