    "rope - like assemblies of filamentous biopolymers are important and common structural elements in living organisms .",
    "fibers of cellulose and collagen provide mechanical reinforcement of extra - cellular plant and animal tissue  @xcite while inside of eukaryotic cells , bundles of cytoskeletal protein filaments  microtubles , filamentous actin ( f - actin ) and intermediate filaments  are implicated in an outstanding array of physiological processes , from cell division and adhesion to motility and mechanosensing  @xcite .",
    "understanding the physical mechanisms that underly the robust and high fidelity assembly pathways of protein filaments is thus an important , outstanding challenge with broad implications in biology .",
    "key questions revolve around the role played by the myriad types of relatively compact , crosslinking proteins that coassemble in parallel bundles and fibers of certain protein filaments , the primary example of these being parallel actin bundles  @xcite . though the intrinsic properties of f - actin are largely conserved among different cell types and species , the structural , mechanical and dynamic properties of f - actin bundles are evidently quite modular .",
    "for example , filopodial bundles  @xcite that form at the periphery of motile cells are loosely organized and highly dynamical structures of rather limited diameter ( @xmath0 100 nm ) , while f - actin bundles formed in mechanosensory appendages of the cochlea and inner ear  @xcite are nearly crystalline in cross - section and quite large by comparison ( @xmath0 1 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "recent experimental studies of parallel actin bundles _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite demonstrate that to large extent the mechanical and structural properties of bundle assemblies can be attributed to the crosslinking proteins as well as their interactions with the bundled filaments .",
    "an important but unresolved question concerns the organization of crosslinks in the bundle and how this organization reflects structural features of the filaments themselves .",
    "in particular , protein filaments are universally helical in structure  @xcite , and by virtue of the helical distribution of binding sites , interactions mediated by proteins crosslinking neighboring filaments must reflect the underlying chiral nature of the assembly . indeed ,",
    "there is numerous experimental evidence to show that crosslinking actin in parallel bundles modifies the torsional state of constituent filaments from their native , unbound geometry  @xcite .",
    "the extent to which this helical twist is transfered more globally to the structure of crosslinked actin bundles  as has been observed in superhelical assemblies of fibrin  @xcite and collagen fibers  @xcite  is presently unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the fundamental interplay between the helical structure of biological protein filaments and intrinsic torques generated by self - organizing distributions of crosslinks between filaments in regular bundle arrays .",
    "our task is to develop a generic theoretical model for the frustration that arises between the regular in - plane organization of filaments in bundles and the helical distribution of crosslinking sites along the filaments .",
    "we seek to understand how this frustration can be relieved at the expense of different types of mechanical distortions of the filament assembly , in particular , a global twist distortion of the parallel array .",
    "a number of theoretical  @xcite , computational  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies demonstrate that chiral filament interactions which tend to twist bundled assemblies have the important consequence of providing an intrinsic and thermodynamic limitation to the lateral growth of bundles . in the present study",
    ", we show that the helical distribution of crosslinking sites on the filaments gives rise to a tendency for neighboring filaments to twist in order to relieve the elastic cost of distorting crosslinks . in turn , the tendency to twist filaments superhelically in the bundle leads to a mechanical cost for growing the bundle diameter that for sufficiently weak crosslink affinities and sufficiently high crosslink densities becomes finite in equilibrium .",
    "our approach to this problem is based on a generalization of the `` worm - like bundle '' model of crosslinked filaments  @xcite .",
    "this semi - microscopic model treats filaments as semi - flexible polymers decorated by discrete arrays of sites to which elastic crosslinks between neighboring filaments bind .",
    "this model has been successfully used to analyze the complex mechanical response of crosslinked bundles to bend and twist deformations .",
    "however , it does not allow to explore the consequences of the helical filament structure for the bundle mechanical and thermodynamical properties .    in the present study",
    ", we consider a model where crosslink sites are located along helical `` grooves '' on the filaments , which are characterized by bending and torsional stiffness .",
    "modeling the elastic cost of linker distortions , we show that crosslinking between helical filaments leads to a energetic preference to align the opposing grooves of crosslinked filaments .",
    "depending on the relative stiffness of the linker and the filaments we find two different regimes : 1 ) a high - torque `` groove - locked '' regime , where stiff crosslinks force the grooves into alignment , and 2 ) a low - torque `` groove - slip '' regime , in which crosslinks are not stiff enough to enforce this alignment and can not unwind the filaments from their native state of twist .",
    "though of a distinct microscopic origin , we find that in the groove - locked regime linker - mediated interactions lead to a similar elastic frustration as occurring in `` coiled - coil '' assemblies of polypeptides  @xcite .",
    "filament pairs may align opposing grooves by either untwisting the pitch of grooves themselves _ or _ by winding helically around one another with the appropriate pitch .",
    "based on the intrinsic and non - linear torques generated by crosslinking in helical filament bundles , our model makes two important predictions .",
    "first , we predict that subject to an external torque self - assembled bundles of crosslinked helical filaments exhibit non - linear torsional response that is highly - sensitive to both the intrinsic helical geometry of filaments as well as the fraction of bound crosslinks , @xmath2 .",
    "second , we show that the competition between the linker - generated torques and the mechanical energy of bending filaments in superhelical bundles gives rise to the formation of self - limited bundles when the crosslink fraction is larger than a critical value @xmath3 , which is itself determined by the ratio of bending cost of helically winding a pair of filaments to the torsional cost of unwinding the intrinsic twist of the helical grooves .",
    "a primary conclusion of this study is that finite - diameter bundles of helical filaments form preferentially when crosslinks are highly resistant to in - plane shear distortions and filaments have a large torsional stiffness relative to the bending modulus .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our model of crosslinked helical filament assemblies and in sec .",
    "iii we derive the form of the linker - mediated torsional energy of filament bundles . in sec .",
    "iv we determine the dependence of bundle twist on bundle size , as well as the torsional response of self - assembled bundles . in sec .",
    "v we predict the thermodynamic behavior of crosslinked filament assemblies in terms of the density and binding energy of crosslinks in the bundle . finally , we conclude with a discussion of our results in the context of biological filament assemblies .",
    "to describe the interaction between crosslinking in parallel bundles and the helical geometry of constituent filaments , we introduce the following coarse - grained model , depicted schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : model ] . in the cross - section ( `` in - plane '' ) , the bundle is organized into a hexagonal array , with the center - to - center spacing of neighbor filaments , @xmath4 .",
    "crosslinkers bind to neighboring filaments in parallel bundles , and reflecting the helical symmetry of the filament , the ends of crosslinks are located at discrete points on helical grooves on the filaments . in the most general case , helical filaments possess a range of groove geometries of differing helical symmetry . for the purposes of the following analysis , we focus on the simple case where binding sites are located on double - helical grooves , which are perfectly out of phase ( @xmath5 between grooves ) .",
    "the crosslinking sites are linearly spaced by a vertical separation , @xmath6 , along the filament backbone direction , and the pitch of each helical groove is defined to be @xmath7 .",
    "albeit simpler , this double helical geometry is not unlike the two - start helical structure of f - actin  @xcite , whose grooves rotate at a rate @xmath8 in the native state of twist and @xmath9 represents the vertical distance separating 2 actin monomers along the same bi - helical groove .",
    "while in actin filaments , the monomers on opposing grooves are off - set vertically by @xmath10 , the present simplified model has the advantage that in the lowest energy state , which allows for maximal crosslinking , all filaments maintain the same axial `` orientation '' , meaning that grooves in each vertical plane are aligned along the same direction .",
    "certainly , the analysis may be extended to address groove geometries that lead to non - trivial , inter - filament correlations , as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our purpose here is to analyze the simplest model describing the interplay between helical geometry of filaments and the inter- and intra - filament torques that arise in crosslinked parallel bundles .    in parallel bundles ,",
    "crosslinks bind selectively to pairs of sites which are closest in separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bindingzone ] ) , which in our model occur when grooves on any neighbor filament `` cross '' , and the orientation of the groove at a given plane is perfectly aligned with the in - plane vector separating the neighbors . for perfectly straight filaments with native twist , such a crossing occurs every @xmath11 along the backbone between any neighbor pair , and over a distance @xmath12 , the crossing rotates from one of the six neighbors of a given filament to the next . here , we will consider the case where the fraction , @xmath2 , of occupied crosslinking sites in the bulk of the bundle is fixed . by the assumption of the minimal crosslink stretching ,",
    "crossing points are populated first , followed by sites closest to the crossing point , and so on , until a `` binding zone '' representing the @xmath13 wedge shared by any 2 neighboring filaments is occupied with the appropriate number of crosslinks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bindingzone ] ) .      to model the elastic cost of crosslinks that are poorly aligned due to the helical distribution of sites we introduce the following simple crosslink energy , @xmath14 here",
    ", @xmath15 is the energy of a single crosslinker in the bundle , and @xmath16 represents the `` bare '' energy gain for binding between 2 perfectly aligned sites .",
    "the second term represents the elastic cost of _ shear _ distortions of crosslinks away from the perfectly aligned geometry perpendicular to the backbone orientations .",
    "specifically , @xmath17 represents the _ in - plane shear _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "this model has marked similarities with a model for contact between hydrophobic residues on @xmath18-helical polypeptide chains studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and hence , our current model may also be applicable to the study of coiled - coil bundles of @xmath18-helices .",
    "depending on the location of the crosslink in the bundle , these distortions , @xmath17 , are purely determined by the state of twist of constituent filaments as well as the global twisting of the bundle itself .",
    "the twist of individual filaments is described by the angle , @xmath19 , that describes the orientation of the groove in the @xmath20 plane of filament packing .",
    "hence , for the case of native filament twist , @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the `` local '' twist of individual filaments , the bundle may twist as a whole described by @xmath22 , the rate at which in - plane lattice directions rotate around @xmath23 axis , the long axis of he bundle .",
    "notice that in this description , @xmath24 and @xmath22 are decoupled by construction , meaning that filaments may be twisted without the bundle experiencing twist ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) or the bundle may be twisted without distortion the native symmetry of the constituent filaments ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 )  .",
    "it is clear from this geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) that @xmath17 is determined by the _ relative rotation _ of the grooves with respect to the bundle lattice directions .",
    "this relative rotation can be measured by the angle , @xmath29 which gives the angle between the helical groove and the nearest neighbor lattice separation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . from this",
    "we have the in - plane linker shear , @xmath30 when both @xmath24 and @xmath22 are non - zero , the distance between crossover points is determined by the distance over which the _ relative angle _ rotates by @xmath13",
    ". we will call this distance , @xmath31 , and refer to such a @xmath13 wedge shared by 2 filaments as a `` binding zone '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bindingzone ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean rate of relative rotation in this span .",
    "likewise , it is easy to see that of this zone , only a length @xmath34 centered around the crossover point will be occupied with crosslinks .    before analyzing the structural and thermodynamic consequences of in - plane shear costs of crosslinking bonds",
    ", we note that a superhelical twist of the bundle introduces other , out - of - plane modes of crosslinker shear .",
    "we discuss , in the appendix , that a reorganization of the crosslinking sites along the long axis of the bundle allows linkers to trade a high elastic energy out - of - plane shear cost for lower energy in - plane distortion . furthermore , under this linker reorganization the elastic cost of non - zero out - of - plane shear , ultimately contributes to the total free energy of the bundle at higher order than the leading - order , @xmath35 , cost of in - plane shear derived below and represents nominal modification to the forgoing analysis .",
    "in this section , we consider a helical filament bundle at a fixed , constant rate of bundle twist , @xmath22 . the aim is to integrate out the distribution of the individual crosslinks and the twist of filaments within a binding zone to derive an effective free energy in terms of bundle twist alone .",
    "> from this , we learn that crosslinking helical filament bundles necessarily introduces intrinsic torques which tend to wind the bundle superhelically in order to reduce in - plane shearing of linkers .",
    "competing with the cost of crosslink shear , is the cost for twisting individual filaments away from their native helical symmetry , @xmath36.\\ ] ] here @xmath37 is the torsional modulus of the filament and we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) to rewrite the filament rotation , @xmath38 , in terms of the groove alignment angle @xmath39 .",
    "we analyze the respective costs of linker shear and filament twist , by considering the profile of crosslinking occurring within a single binding zone ( shown in figure [ fig : bindingzone ] ) . within a binding zone",
    "@xmath40 rotates by @xmath13 as opposing grooves come into near registry .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 is the length of the binding zone along the long axis of the bundle , then the cross term in eq .",

    "[ fig : bindingzone ] , at fixed fraction of bond crosslink sites , @xmath2 , linkers occupy a span of size @xmath34 centered around the close contact between opposing helical grooves . hence , for @xmath31",

    "( [ eq : dperp ] ) we find that @xmath43 represents the effective pinning strength of the linkers located at @xmath44 , which favor pinning the relative orientation to @xmath45 .",
    "the minimal energy torsional state of the filament is determined by , @xmath46 this equation , along with the boundary condition @xmath47 , is satisfied by the following rotation profile , @xmath48 where @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is a characteristic lengthscale defined by the relative cost of filament twist and linker shear .",
    "it is the lengthscale over which the filament twist can adjust from its native rate to the value required in the binding zone .    the twist profile within a binding zone is largely determined by the ratio of this elastic lengthscale to the size of the binding zone .",
    "some characteristic groove - slip profiles @xmath40 are displayed in figure [ fig : psi ] . in the rigid filament limit , where @xmath51 , the solution is simply @xmath52 , which is equivalent to a homogeneously twisted state , @xmath53 .",

    "limit , the linker elasticity pins or locks the groove over the region of occupied linkers . as a consequence",
    "the filament twist in this region follows the bundle twist , @xmath56 .",

    ", the elastic energy is set by the deformation of the flexible crosslinks , @xmath79 , but does not depend on the amplitude of the bundle twist @xmath22 .",
    "thus , increasing bundle twist does not appreciably increase the cost of shear deformation in the crosslinks .",
    "instead , the crosslinks reorganize into new binding sites allowing them to maintain a constant average crosslink deformation .",
    "this is possible , as in hexagonal bundles the angle @xmath80 is an upper limit for the angle between two neighboring grooves , _ independent _ of the size of the binding zone , @xmath31 .",

    "the energy scale is set by the filament twist stiffness @xmath37 .",
    "the linker - mediated interactions lead to a preference to twist the bundle at a rate equal to the intrinsic twist of filaments , @xmath84 .",
    "this latter case reflects the fact that crosslinks on neighboring filaments lock a span of length @xmath34 into a parallel configuration . by rotating the interfilament position at a rate @xmath85",
    ", these groove - locked domains on neighbor filaments can be brought into coincidence with the native , helical geometry of the untwisted grooves .",
    "therefore , a high degree of crosslinking by rigid linkers ( @xmath86 ) induces an _ intrinsic torque _ on the entire bundle , which prefers the fiament lattice to rotate at the rate of the helical grooves .",
    "the crossover between groove - locked and groove - slip behavior can be related to @xmath87 .",
    "groove - locking occurs for @xmath88 , while groove - slip occurs for larger deviations from optimal twist , @xmath89 , where , @xmath90 therefore , as shown in fig .",

    "in the previous section we have derived the form of the linker - induced elastic energy for global twist of crosslinked bundles of helical filaments .",
    "we found that crosslinks induce torques that tend to twist the bundle as a whole .",
    "these intrinsic torques give rise to unusual structural and mechanical properties for self - assembled bundles , including a highly non - linear dependence of bundle twist on lateral size and externally applied torsional moment .",
    "to demonstrate these properties , we consider crosslinked bundles of semi - flexible helical filaments with a twist - dependence described by eq .",

    "the distinction between a purely harmonic twist energy for stiff linkers and a non - linear twist energy for flexible linkers has key consequences for the structural and mechanical properties of crosslinked , helical filament bundles .",

    "grooves remain locked in close contact , so that the optimal twist derives purely from the competition between the bending cost of rotating filaments superhelically in the bundle , and the twist elastic cost needed to maintain groove - alignment when filaments are parallel .",

    "the fundamental cohesive energy scale is determined by @xmath225 , which corresponds to the energy of untwisting the intrinsic rotation of the helical grooves of the filaments .",
    "the different modes of elastic deformation induced by crosslinkers in helical filament bundles account for the presence of two fundamental scales of bound crosslinker fraction , @xmath2 .",
    "the first , @xmath226 , can be understood as the ratio of the mechanical costs of two pair - wise filament geometries : @xmath227 , roughly the bend cost of winding a filament pair into a groove - locked coiled - coil geometry ; and @xmath228 , the mechanical cost of untwisting the intrinsic helical grooves into parallel filaments .",
    "we find that for flexible crosslinks , @xmath3 sets a lower limit for the fraction of bound crosslinkers at which self - limited bundles form , suggesting that self - assembled bundles are thermodynamically favored when the cost of filament bend is relatively small compared to the cost of filament twisting .",
    "the final parameter , @xmath229 , reflects the relative elastic cost of linker shear to filament twist and determines the density of crosslinkers below which high - torque , groove - locked bundle states crossover to low - torque , groove - slip behavior .",
    "hence , we can classify the thermodynamic distinctions between linker - mediated assembly by the ratio @xmath230 which is much greater or less than 1 for the respective rigid and flexible behaviors depicted in fig .",

    "recent small - angle scattering studies suggest , in fact , that the presence of different crosslinking proteins modify the twist of bundle actin filaments to a similar degree , but reconstituted solutions of actin bundles exhibit a remarkably different sensitivity to the concentration of crosslinking proteins  @xcite .",
    "the crosslinking protein fascin , a primary component of filopodial bundles  @xcite , was shown to assemble filaments into bundles with a continuously variable degree of filament twist , while the crosslinking protein espin  @xcite , an abundant crosslinker in microvillar and mechanosensitive stereosciliar bundles , drove a discrete transition between the native state of twist and the torsional geometry of the `` fully - bundled '' actin filaments .",
    "theoretical studies of a model actin filaments in bulk , parallel arrays attribute this difference in twist sensitivity to differences in the _ stiffness _ of the crosslinking bonds themselves  @xcite .    in our model , we show that the presence of crosslinking bonds in parallel arrays of helical filaments not only modifies the torsional geometry of individual filaments , but in general determines the amount of global twist of the entire bundle assembly .",
    "in particular , we show that the competition between the inter - filament geometry preferred by crosslinking and the bend elasticity of filaments mediates an intrinsic feedback between the lateral assembly size and the amount of superhelical twist .",

    "additionally , our theory establishes a range of further predictions on both the affinity and flexibility of crosslinking proteins , suggesting the need for further experiments on the influence of size and structure of parallel actin bundles on properties of crosslinkers .",
    "notably , the implied differences in the compliance between fascin and espin crosslinks should be correlated with measurably differences in the assembly thermodynamics of reconstituted bundle forming solutions .    in summary",
