    "plasmas in external trapping potentials have been attracting increasing interest over the last few years in many fields , including trapped ions , e.g. @xcite , dusty plasmas , e.g. @xcite and electrons and positrons in penning traps , see e.g. @xcite for an overview . among the main reasons",
    "is that , in these systems , it is relatively easy to realize strong correlation effects in charged particle systems",
    ". probably the most spectacular manifestation of these effects is coulomb liquid behavior and crystal formation which has been found in various geometries . in particular , the ion crystals and the recently observed spherical dust crystals or `` coulomb balls ''",
    "@xcite have triggered intensive new experimental and theoretical work , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the shell structure of these crystals , including details of the shell radii and the particle distribution over the shells has been very well explained theoretically by a simple model involving an isotropic yukawa - type pair repulsion and an harmonic external confinement potential @xcite .",
    "still , it remains an open question , how the average particle distribution inside the trap looks like , if it is the same as in the case of coulomb interaction .",
    "it is well known that in a parabolic potential , particles interacting via the coulomb potential establish a radially constant density profile . here , we extend this analysis to a plasma with yukawa interaction by solving a variational problem for the ground state density ( sec .",
    "ii ) . then , in sec .",
    "iii we demonstrate that screening has a dramatic effect on the density profile giving rise to a parabolic decrease away from the trap center .",
    "there we demonstrate that the result for the density profile can be directly generalized to any anisotropic confinement potential .",
    "while our analysis is based on a continuous plasma model on the mean - field level , we find ( sec . iv ) , by comparison with molecular dynamics simulations , that the results apply also to spherical crystals with a shell structure .",
    "we consider a finite one - component plasma ( ocp ) containing @xmath0 identical particles with mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 in an external potential @xmath3 with pair interaction potential @xmath4 described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 the classical ground state energy follows from eq .",

    "the ground state corresponds to the minimum of the energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) with respect to the density profile with the restrictions that the density is non - negative everywhere and reproduces the total particle number , i.e. @xmath9    this gives rise to the variational problem @xmath10}{\\delta n({\\bf r})},\\ ] ] where @xmath11=e[n]+\\mu\\biggl\\{n-\\int d^3r\\ , n({\\bf r})\\biggr\\},\\ ] ] and we introduced a lagrange multiplier @xmath12 ( the chemical potential ) to fulfil condition ( [ eq : n ] ) .",
    "the variation leads to @xmath13 which holds at any point where the density is non - zero . also , eq .  ( [ eq : varproblem ] ) is equivalent to vanishing of the total force on the particles separately at any space point @xmath14 , cf .",

    "( [ eq : varequation ] ) , which is then treated as an equation for @xmath12 , with the result @xmath26      for the frequently encountered case of a parabolic external potential , @xmath27 , we obtain for the density from eq .",

    "( [ eq : varproblem ] ) , the ground state density profile can be obtained from the condition of a local equilibrium of the total force ( internal plus external ones ) at each point where the density is non - zero .",
    "on the other hand , the shape of the radial density profile and its change with variation of @xmath37 is directly related to a change of the force equilibrium . here",
    ", we demonstrate this for the special case of a spherically symmetric confinement potential @xmath23 .",
    "the forces can be directly derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : varequation ] ) by taking the gradient in radial direction @xmath54 which means that , for any spherical layer at a distance @xmath24 from the center , the external force @xmath55 which acts towards the center is balanced by the internal force due to the yukawa repulsion between the particles .",
    "the internal force contains two parts where @xmath56 arises from the action of all particles inside the given layer , @xmath57 , and acts outward , whereas @xmath58 results from the action of all particles located outside @xmath59 , and acts inward , @xmath60 this force balance can be used to obtain the ground state density profile .",
    "alternatively , we can use the computed profile to analyze the two internal force contributions and their dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "consider first the limit of weak screening , @xmath36 .",
    "then the forces approach the coulomb case and , in the case of a constant density profile ( [ eq : rc ] ) ,    @xmath61    with @xmath62 being the particle number in the inner region .",
    "this means , the force is repulsive and increases linearly with @xmath24 and exactly compensates the linear external force @xmath63 for all values @xmath64 .    in the general case of finite screening the outer force",
    "@xmath65 does not vanish , cf .",
    "( [ eq : forceequation ] ) .",
    "since its direction is always towards the center , the force @xmath66 has to increase simultaneously , in order to compensate the combined effect of @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",
    "this effect increases continuously with increasing @xmath37 which is directly verified by evaluating the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : forceequation ] ) .",
    "the result for the density profile in an isotropic confinement , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nr ] ) , can be easily extended to arbitrary geometry . for this purpose",
    "we use the text book result that the charge density corresponding to the yukawa potential is @xmath68 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the poisson equation as @xmath69 showing that the yukawa potential is the green s function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "this fact can be used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varproblem ] ) for the case of a confinement potential @xmath3 of arbitrary geometry @xmath70 to get the explicit result for the density profile @xmath71",
    "so far we have considered the model of a continuous density distribution @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state of a confined spherically symmetric system of discrete point - like charged particles is known to have a shell structure as was demonstrated for dusty plasmas in ref .",
    "@xcite . it is , therefore , of interest to verify if such a shell structure can be derived from our starting equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) for the total energy and to compare our results to the radial density distribution in such coulomb or yukawa balls .",
    "the concentric shells observed in spherical trapped coulomb crystals have led to the proposal of simple analytical models , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite . such a model for a trapped one - component plasma",
    "is trivially derived from the total energy expression ( [ eq : energy ] ) by inserting for the density the ansatz @xmath73 which describes @xmath74 concentric shells of zero thickness with @xmath75 particles on shell @xmath76 with radius @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the number of particles in the trap center ( zero or one ) @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtain for the total ground state energy of a yukawa plasma in an isotropic general confinement potential @xmath3 @xmath80 this is essentially the yukawa shell model of totsuji et al . , ref .",
    "@xcite where , however , the finite size correction factor @xmath81 in the intrashell contribution and the term @xmath79 are missing . in the coulomb limit , @xmath82 , the result simplifies with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and we immediately recover the coulomb shell model of hasse and avilov @xcite ( plus the additional correction factor ) .",
    "a further improvement is possible by including intrashell correlations @xcite .",
    "the simplest model is obtained by replacing @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a fit parameter close to one which allows to achieve excellent agreement with the exact ground state @xcite . an alternative way to include correlations",
    "was proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to compare the density profile @xmath72 of our continuous model with the density of discrete spherical yukawa crystals , we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the ground state of a large number of coulomb balls , for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite . as an example , the numerical results for a coulomb ball with @xmath46 which is large enough to exhibit macroscopic behavior @xcite are included in fig .",
    "the symbols denote the average particle density around each of the shells .",
    "the averaging was accomplished by substituting each particle by a small but finite sphere , so that a smooth radial density profile was obtained .",
    "with increasing @xmath37 the crosses move towards the center confirming the compression of the coulomb balls observed before @xcite .",
    "obviously , the simulation results are very well reproduced by the analytical density profile ( [ eq : parabolicsolution ] ) of a continuous plasma .",
    "but there are also small discrepancies in the central part which grow slowly with @xmath37 .",
    "one reason is that , for large @xmath37 , the width of the inner shells increases rapidly , making the comparison difficult .",
    "another possible reason could be the effect of correlations .",
    "in summary , we have presented a theoretical analysis of the ground state density profile of spatially confined one - component plasmas in dependence on the form of the pair interaction .",
    "an explicit result for the density profile for an arbitrary confinement potential has been derived . in particular , for an isotropic confinement , we have found that screening of the coulomb interaction substantially modifies the radial density distribution .",
    "in contrast to a bare coulomb interaction for which the density inside a parabolic external potential is constant , for a screened interaction , a quadratic decay away form the center is found .",
    "interestingly , while our results were derived for a continuous density distribution ( a macroscopic system ) and with neglect of binary correlations , our analytical results agree very well also with first - principle simulation results for strongly correlated coulomb and yukawa clusters containing several thousands of particles for screening paramters @xmath87 .",
    "this agreement is by no means trivial and deserves further analysis .",
    "further , it is very interesting to investigate the reason for the deviations at large values of the screening parameter , and analyze the effect of binary correlations on the density distributions is .",
