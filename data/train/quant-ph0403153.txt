    "the quantum walks attract our attention not only in a fundamental field of quantum mechanics [ 1 ] but also in a filed of quantum information [ 2 ] ( see also recent review with many references [ 3 ] ) .",
    "this is because the quantum walks will be achieved on quantum computers [ 4 ] , and it may be used as a new quantum algorithm .",
    "a classical random walker on a line moves to a nearest left site _ or _ a nearest right site randomly at every time step .",
    "on the other hand , a quantum walker moves , in superposition , both left _ and _ right according to additional degree of freedom called  chirality \" .",
    "first of all , we describe the hardamrd walk , which is the most well - known quantum walk .",
    "the hadamard walk is characterized by two parameters .",
    "the first is the spatial position and the second is the chirality , which takes values  @xmath0 \" and  @xmath1 \" .",
    "the corresponding hilbert spaces are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the set of complex numbers .",
    "the position space consists of basis states @xmath5 corresponding to the walker located at @xmath6-th lattice site .",
    "possible experimental implementations of the hadamard walk have been proposed by a number of authors [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "for example , a quantum walker is an atom and internal states of the atom such as hyperfine structure are used to distinguish the chirality .",
    "let @xmath7 be a value of wave function at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 with the chirality @xmath10 .",
    "the wave function is changed by superimposing @xmath11 on @xmath12 at ever time step ( details are defined in the next section ) .",
    "assume that a walker exists at the origin in spatial - temporal plane , then we find the walker in the symmetrical hadamard walk with the same probability at the position 1 or @xmath1 after a single transformation .",
    "this behavior is the same as symmetric classical random walk .",
    "the primary question in the quantum walk is to determine the probability distribution of the walker after repeating the transformation of wave function .",
    "the recent extensive studies made clear mathematical properties of the hadamard walk .",
    "we know that the probability distribution is quite different from that of classical random walk .",
    "when the initial wave function is given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , ( symmetric case ) , we see that double peaks spread in the mutually different direction . furthermore the standard deviation increases in proportion to time .",
    "this means that the quantum walker spreads more quickly than classical random walker , and it is a desirable feature for seeking problems .",
    "recent studies revealed that there are two distinguishing profiles in modified hadamard walks on an infinite space .",
    "when the walker exists initially at the origin , the one of shapes is concave in a broad way and the other shape is a spike .",
    "the spike at the initial time in the symmetrical hadamard walk sprits two peaks and they move away from the origin as time increases .",
    "the probability of finding the walker near the origin decreases and approaches to zero .",
    "thus the probability distribution of the original hadamard walk belongs to the former . on the other hand",
    ", we can always find a walker with high probability near the origin in the later case .",
    "we know little about the spiky probability distribution in the later case .",
    "the existence of the spikes are already reported in the two - dimensional grover walk [ 7,8 ] , one - dimensional quantum walk as many coins [ 9 ] , but , no probability distributions are calculated explicitly . in this paper",
    "we consider quantum walk with four internal states , which is the same as the quantum walk with many coins essentially , and compute analytically the probability distribution .",
    "the hadamard walker described above has two internal quantum states and moves to only nearest neighbor sites , while a walker in  four - state quantum walk \" can move beyond nearest neighbor sites by a single transformation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define multi - state quantum walk generally and show a result obtained by simulation in the next section . in section 3 , eigenvalues of the time evolution matrix",
    "are exactly calculated and the wavefunction is expressed using those eigenvalues . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce a time - averaged probability and show that the quantum walker is found with high probability at the initial position . in section 5 ,",
    "a quantum walker with three internal states , in which a walker jumps asymmetrically , is considered and it is shown that localization is not observed .",
    "we consider a quantum walker with @xmath6 different internal states and moves to @xmath6 different lattice sites according to the internal states .",
    "assume that @xmath6 is an even integer larger than 2 .",
    "let @xmath15 .",
    "we then define the transformation of @xmath6-state quantum walk by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this transformation is quite simple , but , it produces rich quantum effects . if the number of internal state is four , we regard the above transformation as the quantum version of the classical random walk in which a walker jumps to each nearest site and next nearest site with the same probability @xmath19 .    our main conclusion arguing that the particle in @xmath6-state quantum walk is trapped near the starting point is available for any even @xmath6 except @xmath20 , but in this paper we focus on four - state quantum walk to avoid excessive generality .",
    "the transformation with @xmath20 is diffrent from the hadamard transformation , and the dynamics of @xmath21-state quantum walk is trivial .",
    "we begin to calculate the probability distribution of the quantum walks on a circle containing @xmath22 sites [ 10 ] .",
    "we define the probability of finding a walker at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 by @xmath23 where ",

    ", fig.1 shows the snapshot of probability distribution at @xmath25 starting from an initial wave function : @xmath26     comparison of probability distributions between the hadamard walk and four - state quantum walk at @xmath25 .",
    "a walker initially exists at the origin in both cases .",
    "the walker in the hadamard walk moves away form the origin .",
    "the walker in four - state quantum walk , by contrast , stays at the origin with high probability . ]    in contrast with the hadamard walk we clearly find a single spike at the origin in four - state quantum walk .",
    "a similar spike has also been observed in two - dimensional quantum walk by simulation [ 7 ] and the height of time - averaged probability at the origin is exactly calculated [ 8 ] .",
    "however , the probability distribution has not been obtained explicitly as a function of the location .",
    "for these reason , the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the time - averaged probability distribution of four - state quantum walk and show that the spike in fig.1 does not disappear even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the time evolution of the wavefunction of the multi - state quantum walk @xmath27 is determined by transformation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : get ] ) and it is expressed briefly by introducing a time evolution operator @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 . since the matrix @xmath28 is unitary , @xmath27 is explicitly given by transforming @xmath28 to a diagonal matrix as a function of the time .",
    "using fourier transformation it is found that eigenvalues of @xmath28 are calculated from the eigenvalues of the following matrix : @xmath30 \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } -1 &   1    &    1   &   1 \\\\ 1   & -1    &    1   &   1 \\\\ 1   &   1    &   -1   &   1 \\\\ 1   &   1    &    1   & -1   \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",
    "changing the value of @xmath32 from 0 to @xmath33 , we get all eigenvalues of @xmath28 ( see details in ref . [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "we stress here that the eigenvalues @xmath1 and @xmath39 are independent of value @xmath32 , put simply , they are strongly degenerative .",
    "in fact , the degree of degeneracy for @xmath1 and @xmath39 are @xmath40 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath41 for @xmath42 , the degree of degeneracy of other eigenvalues is two unless @xmath22 is a multiple of 5 . in case of @xmath43 ,",
    "the classification of eigenvalues is more complicated .",
    "thus we suppose that @xmath22 is odd and @xmath22 is not a multiple of 5 in this paper .    all eigenvalues are now obtained and then the wave function is formally expressed by @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the argument of @xmath46 , and",
    "the first and second terms express the contribution of eigenvalue @xmath1 and 1 to the wave function .",
    "the coefficients in the above formula are calculated from the eigenvectors of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath46 of @xmath34 and @xmath48 be the @xmath49-th element for @xmath50 .",
    "we assume additionally @xmath51 is an orthonormal basis .",
    "then the @xmath52-th element of eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath28 with @xmath46 , which becomes an orthonormal basis is obtained by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the integer part of @xmath55 .",

    "in general , the value of wave function at any fixed position @xmath8 does not converge to a constant value .",
    "thus we here define the time - averaged probability of finding the particle at the position @xmath8 and in the internal state @xmath60 in order to show the localization in long time scale as @xmath61 noting that @xmath62 for @xmath63 , we have the following equation : @xmath64    let us consider time - averaged probability in the limit @xmath65 below . combining eqs .",
