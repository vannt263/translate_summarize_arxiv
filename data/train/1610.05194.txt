    "it had been realized that this effect was promising for non - volatile memory applications @xcite . since",
    "then resistive switching phenomena has puzzled a lot of scientists .",
    "the burst of scientific activities begun in 2008 when two - terminal devices that demonstrate hysteretic current  voltage behavior were understood as memristor devices @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the resistive switching effect is one of the best - known phenomena in complex oxide - based heterostructures proposed for a novel memory cell .",
    "a lot of scientists and engineers are engaged in studies and applications of the resistive switching .",
    "presently , some plausible models for resistive switching in oxides have been reported@xcite . among them",
    "is the voltage - enhanced oxygen - vacancy migration model ( veovm ) for bipolar resistive switching@xcite .",
    "an essential role of oxygen vacancies and their motion on the resistive switching effect in transition - metal oxides has been established in last decades @xcite . in particular , oxygen diffusion",
    "is considered to be a key factor of the switching in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 with schottky - like barrier at the interface @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed asymmetry of current - voltage characteristics has been recently explained using the oxygen diffusion scenario in yttrium barium copper oxide @xcite .",
    "rearrangements of oxygen vacancies diffusing to and away from metal - complex oxide interfaces can although correlate with the evolution of the resistance of the la@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath2 based memristive device @xcite .    in this paper , we chose lanthanum calcium manganate to model the resistive switching phenomenon in metal - complex - oxide - metal heterostructures .",
    "the doped manganese oxide la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lcmo ) is attractive due to its benefits for practical applications at room temperature , it is already being actively investigated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the lcmo - based memristive device can demonstrate good endurance of switching cycles @xcite .",
    "it is known that the oxygen nonstoichiometry of complex oxides affects their resistivity .",
    "for instance , a shift of the metal - to - insulator transition as a function of the oxygen deficiency ( @xmath4 ) in perovskite - type la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath5 thin films exists in the range of 0@xmath60.21@xcite .",
    "the film - substrate interface can influence the resistive properties of epitaxial la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films as well @xcite .",
    "previous studies assumed that there is a linear relationship between the local resistivity and the oxygen - vacancy concentration in manganites @xcite .",
    "however , in reality the form of such dependence is more complicated .",
    "for example , the local electrical resistivity of transition - metal oxides with a perovskite - type structure as a nonlinear function of the oxygen - vacancy concentration was obtained experimentally in a wide temperature range @xcite . as was pointed out",
    ", the type of such dependence can strongly affect the hysteresis observed in metal - oxide heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore how it controls the resistive switching in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath5 .",
    "we follow the idea that the formation of a shock wave provides a sharp change in the resistance of manganese oxides @xcite and start with the one - dimensional continuity equation for mobile oxygen vacancies @xmath7 where the local concentration of mobile vacancies @xmath8 changes in time @xmath9 , and the total oxygen - vacancy current @xmath10 is divided in two parts : a diffusion current @xmath11 and a drift current @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 .",
    "the flow of vacancies from high to low concentrations along the space coordinate @xmath14 normal to the cross - section of the lcmo - based heterojunction can be described by the fick s first law of diffusion @xmath15 , while the electric field @xmath16 is involved in the resistance switching as the driving force for the drift @xmath17 .",
    "we note that according to the einstein relation the mobility @xmath18 of the moving charge @xmath19 is connected with the diffusion constant @xmath20 via @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath23 is the absolute temperature in kelvins .",
    "the probability for oxygen vacancy to overcome the energy barrier and jump back ( @xmath24 ) or forth ( @xmath25 ) by the distance @xmath26 between any two neighbouring lattice sites is @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the attempt frequency , and @xmath29 , the activation energy for vacancy motion . due to the activation - barrier lowering @xmath30 caused by the electric field @xmath16 applied to the metal electrodes oxygen vacancies in lcmo are mobile enough to migrate detectably at room temperature@xcite .",
    "the average velocity @xmath31 of such motion is given by @xmath32    we restrict ourselves to the case of small electric fields @xmath33 when the average mobility of the oxygen vacancies is @xmath34    the connection between the local electric field and the electrical current @xmath35 is determined by the ohm s law @xmath36 , where the resistivity @xmath37 is some function of the oxygen - vacancy concentration . in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath5 compounds , as can be extracted from the electrical resistivity versus temperature measurements for the samples with the oxygen deficiency @xmath38 = 0 , 0.01 , 0.025 , the relationship between the local resistivity @xmath39 and the oxygen - vacancy concentration @xmath4 is a nonlinear one @xcite : @xmath40 where the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are constants derived from the experimental data .",
    "note that the effect of oxygen vacancies in metallic lcmo is negligible and the resistivity tends to zero @xmath44 .",
    "so we can write the total content of oxygen vacancies @xmath4 as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 has the meaning of the concentration of mobile oxygen vacancies , and @xmath47 is the vacancy concentration at which the metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath20 is usually of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 being the frequency factor .",
    "therefore , the drift of diffusing species with the average mobility ( [ eq : mobility ] ) is given by @xmath50 to include the possibilities for non - harmonic driving current @xmath35 , by which oxygen vacancies are transported from one site to another , let us model its time dependence as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is jacobi elliptic sine function and @xmath53 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "this function is periodic with period @xmath54 and its shape can be continuously varied between the sine - wave ( at @xmath55 ) and the square - wave ( at @xmath56 ) .",
    "based on the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity eq ] ) , migration of the charged species in a thin film of manganese oxide with a thickness @xmath57 normal to the metal / lcmo interface can be modeled by the equation @xmath58 in which the first term tells us that the oxygen - vacancy content changes in time , the second term represents a drift current of charged species , and the third one describes diffusion driven by the concentration gradient .",
    "on introducing new scales for variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 being the maximum value of the electrical current applied , the nonlinear equation ( [ eq : nonlinear diffusion ] ) becomes a dimensionless one : @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 can assumed constant at the given temperature .",
    "note that if @xmath66 , then the equation ( [ eq : dimensionlesseq ] ) reduces to the well known nonlinear burgers equation . for small enough diffusion",
    "it has shock wave solutions in the form of an abrupt step ( that is a jump ) in concentration .",
    "consider the uniform distribution of the oxygen vacancies @xmath67 initially . as it was noted @xcite",
    ", the system of interest is able to switch continuously between two resistive states as long as there is a source of oxygen vacancies at the metal / lcmo interface .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the concentration at the @xmath68 surface of the lcmo is maintained at the initial value , @xmath67 , due to surface oxygen - exchange processes @xcite , while surface flux across the @xmath69 interface between the substrate and the lcmo is assumed to be zero ( cause , in practice , there is no flow of the moving species through it ) . this can be expressed as boundary conditions @xmath70    when the electric current is supplied , oxygen vacancies are driven backwards or forwards depending on its polarity . such a motion",
    "is strongly coupled with the resistivity of the complex oxide . to elucidate the effects of this coupling on the transport properties ,",

    "the parameter @xmath71 incorporates the thin - film thickness @xmath57 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 of the medium , as well as the period of the electrical signal @xmath54 . to make the specific calculations we assume @xmath73 , which gives us stable switching behavior .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is estimated from the condition that the resistive switching effect at room temperature in the lanthanum calcium manganate is typically observed@xcite at the voltage of about @xmath74 between the electrodes , which yields @xmath75 .",
    "the initial concentration of mobile oxygen vacancies in the manganese oxide ( and on the boundary @xmath68 ) is fixed to be constant , @xmath76 ( not very large , which ensures that we do not exceed the range of experimental @xmath77 values ) .",
    "spatial distribution of the oxygen - vacancy concentration is sampled with equal time step of @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : concentration ] .",
    "initially at @xmath79 ( top - left panel ) the concentration profile is a constant , the even half - periods ( right panels ) show the development of a shock - wave profile forming at times @xmath80 .",
    "notice that at times @xmath81 ( left panels ) , vacancies pile up at the metal / lcmo interface .",
    "the vertical range in the left graphs is reduced to show the formation of the shock - wave front at times 0.5;1.5 , otherwise the concentration at @xmath69 can be as high as @xmath82 .",
    "the interface @xmath69 ( where most changes occur ) is nontransparent for oxygen vacancies with zero - flux boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary conditions ] ) .",
    "so , the positively charged oxygen vacancies drift to that interface and accumulate at the metal / lcmo interface ( left panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : concentration ] ) . after changing the polarity of the electrical signal",
    ", the oxygen vacancies travel back from the surface into the bulk of the manganese oxide , and the solution of the equation ( [ eq : dimensionlesseq ] ) transforms into some form of a steep shock wave ( right panels in fig .",

    "now let us discuss the relationship between the oxygen - vacancy distribution and the corresponding changes in the resistance .",
    "the total resistance @xmath88 for a film between @xmath69 and @xmath68 can be computed as @xmath89 where the local resistivity @xmath39 , which is a function of the local vacancy concentration @xmath4 or local mobile vacancy concentration @xmath46 , is given by the eq .",
    "( [ eq : localresistivity ] ) .",
    "according to the experimental data @xcite the constant @xmath90 for the sample with @xmath91 is @xmath92 @xmath93 .",

    "the current - voltage ( @xmath35-@xmath94 ) characteristics , shown in fig .",

    "the top inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : resistance_concentration ] shows the shock - wave formation of the oxygen - vacancy concentration at @xmath99 .",
    "the bottom inset depicts the corresponding time evolution of the resistance calculated using eq.([eq : contact resistance ] ) .",
    "after the first forming cycle the total resistance of the heterostructure changes periodically . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "these reversible changes between the two resistive states occur up to fifty times ( which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistance_concentration ] ) that proves the stability of switching .",
    "initially , the resistivity of the junction is high due to the presence of some amount of oxygen vacancies in the equilibrium doped manganese oxide .",
    "it is then somewhat increased in the forming process .",
    "as the oxygen vacancies leave the interface , the resistance decreases .",
    "we can also see that the rise in oxygen deficiency at the @xmath69 interface brings the system into a high resistive state .",
    "thus , the oxygen - vacancy species moving forwards and backwards can produce the sharp increase or decrease in the resistance , but also the way the oxygen - vacancy concentration profile is changing tells us about the formation of the shock wave within the nanoscale layer at the nontransparent metal / lcmo interface .",
    "the moment @xmath99 , when the concentration wave changes its profile , directly corresponds to the sudden switching of the resistance of the sample , and it can be seen clearly how each time the resistivity and the oxygen - vacancy distribution change together .    obviously , a sudden switching of the resistance is an unavoidable feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimensionlesseq ] ) , mediated by the shock - wave profile of the vacancy concentration .",
    "but the relevant feature is that , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : resistance_concentration ] , the system demonstrates reproducible switching between the two resistive states after only a few electrical cycles .",
    "it is the effect of the nonlinear term entirely .    to obtain a linear function @xmath100 from the data@xcite we fit the dependence of the local resistivity on the oxygen - vacancy content@xcite by @xmath101 using this function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlinear diffusion ] ) results in the concentration profiles , shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : resistance_concentration_line ] . as can be seen",
    ", abrupt jumps in the vacancy content also occur at the interface .",
    "meanwhile , in the bulk of lcmo , the concentration remains nearly constant , which implies a much smaller switching of the total resistance .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistance_concentration_line ] that the sudden changes between the high - resistance state and the low - resistance state is observed . however , there are significant changes in both the local concentration and the contact resistance behavior in the sample .",
    "it looks like an excellent switching  very reversible and stable , but the stability of the contact resistance in high and low resistance states is only achieved after about 80 time periods .",

    "[ fig : resistance vs current ] and  [ fig : current vs voltage ] we plot the hysteresis loops corresponding to three different values of the initial concentration @xmath106 .",

    "each curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistance vs current ] actually consists of five loops , which illustrates high reversibility of the switching .",
    "when @xmath100 is linear , the @xmath88-@xmath35 characteristics show a little window . in the case of nonlinear @xmath100 , the shape of @xmath109 dependence does not change , but",
    "the difference between high and low resistance is significantly larger .    in the two cases described above the current - voltage ( @xmath35-@xmath94 ) characteristics",
    "also display hysteresis ( see fig .  [ fig : current vs voltage ] ) . even if the relationship between the local resistivity and the vacancy content is linear some hysteresis occurs .",
    "if nonlinear term exists in the function @xmath100 , the stable hysteresis takes place .",
    "the first question for electronic applications of the resistive switching phenomena in complex oxide - based devices is how to stabilize the switching process by getting a good endurance of switching cycles . to make switching behavior reliable , experiments have to be designed by fine tuning the set of constants - the film thickness @xmath57 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 of the medium , the period of the electrical signal @xmath54 as well , which should correspond to specific parameter @xmath71 .",
    "if the relationship between the local oxygen - vacancy concentration and the local resistivity is linear , we have to wait a long time for switchings become reversible ( in the case of interest - about 80 cycles of the electrical signal ) .",
    "the main finding here is that effect of nonlinear dependence @xmath110 on hysteresis is such that switchings become reversible after few cycles of the electrical signal .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear behavior of the local resistivity leads to the larger hysteresis windows than in the case of linear dependence .",
    "another result is that the sudden switching of the contact resistance is accompanied by the development of the shock - wave profile that have a common time @xmath99 .",
    "the shock - wave formation at the metal / lcmo interface has been captured in the numerical solutions .",
    "for this reason , we can conclude that the resistance switching effect in manganese oxides is correlated simultaneously with the shock wave formation and propagation , produced by the flow of oxygen vacancies from the nontransparent interface into the bulk of lcmo . on the contrary , in the case of linear fit @xmath107",
    ", the traveling concentration wave does not propagate across the whole bulk and the hysteresis loses its endurance .",
    "this suggests that the design of the nonlinear dependence of the resistivity on the vacancy concentration is necessary to obtain strong and reliable resistance switching .",
