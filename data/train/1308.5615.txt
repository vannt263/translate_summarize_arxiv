    "* our study has a direct relevance to the search of novel topological superconductors requiring an odd parity fully gapped state of cooper pairs @xcite which have recently attracted a great interest due to the existence of majorana modes that appear inside a superconducting energy gap @xcite .",
    "such exotic states are traditionally thought to be associated with an electronic mechanism of superconductivity , but the proposed candidate materials , such as cu@xmath35bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite , tlbite@xmath0@xcite and sn@xmath36in@xmath35te@xcite , are systems with weakly correlated _ sp _",
    "electrons@xcite , and it is likely that the conventional phonon mediated mechanism plays a major role .",
    "there are currently hot debates in the literature about the pairing symmetry in cu@xmath35bi@xmath0se@xmath1 hor , lu - liang-2010,ando , ando-2,kirzhner , bay , stm : based on a two  orbital model , fu and berg @xcite proposed that it is a topological superconductor with a fully gapped state of odd parity pairing . using tunneling experiments ,",

    "we apply density functional linear response method to study the problem of doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "our numerical electronic structures are in accord with previous theoretical results @xcite .",
    "our calculated phonon dispersions for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 along several high  symmetry directions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where similar to prior work @xcite , we see that the phonon frequencies of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 span up to 5.5 thz , and all vibrational modes are found to be quite dispersive despite its 2d  like layered structure .",
    "there are two basic panels in the phonon spectrum : the top 9 branches above 2.5 thz are mainly contributed by vibrations of se atoms , while the low 6 branches come from the bi modes .",
    "our calculated phonon frequencies at @xmath40  agree with the experimental@xcite and previous numerical resultsphonon-1-t very well .",
    "it is found that superconducting cu@xmath35bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has the maximum critical temperature t@xmath41 of 3.8 k  at @xmath42 @xcite and upon further doping the t@xmath41 gradually decreases , but superconductivity remains till @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the copper atoms populate into the interlayer gaps @xcite and have a small effect on the structural properties@xcite . to simulate the doping , we perform virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) calculation with adding _ x _ electrons into the unit cell as a uniform background and calculate wavevector ( @xmath44 ) and vibrational mode ( @xmath45 ) dependent phonon linewidths @xmath46 from which the electron ",

    "a striking feature is that only the phonons along @xmath51z line of the bz , especially one optical mode with the vector @xmath5=(0,0,0.04)@xmath52 has a very large linewidth .",
    "we also note a considerable linewidth for a longitudinal acoustic mode at the same @xmath5 .",
    "this is in principle detectable via neutron scattering experiment .",
    "interestingly , as the contribution to @xmath4 from each mode is proportional to @xmath46 divided by @xmath53 it is the acoustic mode that would provide a dominant contribution to total @xmath4 rather than the optical one .",

    "remarkably , we again find a strongly enhanced function that is peaked at small values of @xmath44 once it approaches zero along @xmath58 . as all nesting features",
    "have been eliminated , it is interesting to understand the nature of this highly non  trivial behavior originated from the acoustic and the optical modes . both essentially correspond to the motion of the bi atoms along _ z_direction . by ignoring the smallness of the wavevector we  performed the calculation for @xmath70 by moving the atoms according to the eigenvectors of the optical mode .",
    "such deformation potential calculation is shown in fig .",
    "4 where the band structures for the undistorted , ( a ) , and the distorted , ( b ) , lattices are plotted in the vicinity of the fermi level in order to illustrate the crucial change in the electronic structure .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has both time  reversal symmetry and the inversion symmetry , and despite the presence of so  coupling , this results in every energy band to be at least double degenerate for the undistorted structure .",
    "the discussed phonon displacement breaks the inversion symmetry and lifts the double degeneracy , resulting in a large epi .",
    "it is worth to mention that this effect only exists for the system with both inversion symmetry and strong soc , and the so coupling is essential here but in its very unusual role to generate a large epi .",
    "in addition to this effect , there is a considerable renormalization of the bandwidth as well as other noticeable features as illustrated in fig.4 that result in the strongly enhanced epi at long wavelengths .",

    "orbit coupling , the cooper pairs are no longer pure spin singlets or triplets but should be composed from superpositions of spinor states .",
    "however , the presence of time reversal and inversion symmetries ensures the two  fold degeneracy of the fermi electrons ( conveniently labeled via the use of a pseudo  spin index ) from which the cooper pairs of even / odd parity and of zero momentum are composed @xcite .",
    "we use crystal harmonics for the fs  polynomials after ref .",
    "for arepresentative doping with @xmath48=0.16 we obtain @xmath73 ( s  like ) for the even parity pseudospin singlet , and @xmath74 ( @xmath75like)@xmath76 @xmath77 ( @xmath78like ) for the odd parity pseudospin triplets .",
    "we also evaluated the coupling constants with @xmath79wave  like symmetries and obtained the values of @xmath4 around 0.2 for the two @xmath80 symmetries and 0.37 for the @xmath81 ( @xmath82like ) one .",
    "consistent with the discussion of our singular electron  phonon model ,  one can see a remarkable proximity of all pairing constants , and especially of @xmath83 @xmath84 very similar trends hold for slightly smaller and larger values of @xmath48 where we find that all couplings constants change monotonically with doping .",
    "finally we note that the effective coupling should include the effect of the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath6 and other possible renormalizations such , e.g. , as spin fluctuations ( sf ) .",
    "it is well known that the values of @xmath85 range between@xmath86 and @xmath87 for most _ s_wave electron  phonon superconductors .",
    "we also expect that @xmath88 for the pairings with higher angular momentum @xcite.while , we do not expect that spin fluctuations are essential for the @xmath89 electron material like doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 we have also evaluated spin fluctuational @xmath4 s using a single  band fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite . using a representative value of @xmath90 ev ( which approximately constitutes 0.4 of the electronic bandwidth ) we have obtained for @xmath48=0.16 : @xmath91 which produces slightly negative ( repulsive ) contributions for the _ s_ and _ d_wave and slightly positive ( attractive ) ones for the _ p_wave pairings .",
    "overall , combining these data in the effective coupling @xmath92 we see that it favors the _",
    "_ pseudo__triplet pairing of @xmath7 symmetry in doped topological superconductor bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , and is capable of producing the values of t@xmath93 k. the behavior of the superconducting energy gap for this symmetry is shown by coloring the fermi surface in fig.2(b ) , where the nodal plane corresponds to @xmath94=0 .    * calculations for other systems . *",
    "in addition to doped bi@xmath0se@xmath95 , we also performed similar studies for tlbite@xmath0@xciteand sn@xmath96in@xmath35te@xcite .",
    "for both compounds , in a wide range of carrier concentration , we can not find any singular behavior of epi , and our results show that the coupling in _",
    "s_wave pairing channel is considerably larger than that in all other channels .",
    "thus we believe that tlbite@xmath0 and sn@xmath96in@xmath35te are conventional _ s_wave superconductors .",
    "in perspective , we think that our discussed effects could be present in several other layered band insulators where strong spin  orbit coupling as well as unbroken time reversal and inversion symmetries could interplay with certain lattice distortions and create exotic superconducting states upon doping .",
    "synthesizing such systems with isolating their thin flakes using a famous graphene s scotch tape method should not be too difficult to make .",
    "this may provide a new platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in general .",
    "although our proposed solution for bi@xmath0se@xmath97 is gapless pseudospin triplet , an odd  parity fully gapped pairing state thought in a topological superconductor can also in principle be realized in other systems using the above discussed singular electron  phonon interaction . finally , a gate tuning was recently used to introduce a carrier doping in monolayered mos@xmath0 and turned on superconductivity @xcite which may be a good way to overcome the inhomogenuity in cu@xmath35bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and experimentally clarify the nature of its pairing state .",
