    "the study of pion production in two nucleon collisions dates back to the mid fifties when one of the earliest measurements of the @xmath12 reaction was performed @xcite .",
    "this was followed by several measurements of this reaction in 1960 s and early seventies @xcite .",
    "these experiments were usually conducted in emulsions or bubble chambers , consequently the data invariably had poor statistics .",
    "however , with the advent of accelerators capable of producing intense high quality beams of protons with energies up to a few gev and sophisticated detecting systems , it became possible to obtain good quality data on the charged as well as neutral pion production in proton - nucleon collisions at several beam energies @xcite .",
    "even the complete kinematical measurements of the three particles in the final state can now be performed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with improved polarisation techniques for beams and targets , the spin observables ( asymmetries ) are also being measured with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "these measurements provide a very stringent test of the theoretical models of the pion production which is the dominant inelastic channel in nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions .",
    "a thorough investigation of the pion production in the elementary nn collisions within a fully relativistic model is essential in the context of recent efforts to develop a covariant two nucleon model ( tnm ) to describe the @xmath13 reactions @xcite , where several parameters have to be fixed from the study of the former reaction .",
    "the precise information about the pion production cross sections in elementary nn collisions is also important for the description of the dynamics of the heavy ion collisions within the kinetic theories ( eg . buu ) @xcite .",
    "although several models have been proposed to study the @xmath14 reactions @xcite , only a few have taken the fully relativistic feynman diagram approach @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study of all the observables ( total , single , double , and triple differential cross sections and asymmetries ) of @xmath15 and @xmath16 reactions over a wide range of beam energies within the covariant model is still lacking , and the form of several ingredients of the model remains to be far from being determined unambiguously .",
    "moreover , the role of @xmath5 and @xmath17 mesons have not been explicitly studied in such theories so far .",
    "fully relativistic calculations could be necessary even at the beam energies closer to the @xmath18 threshold , where the non - relativistic models underpredict the experimental data by a factor of approximately 5 @xcite",
    ". one of the consequences of the relativistic effects is that they lead to an enhancement of the axial vector current of the nn system @xcite , which can increase the pion production cross sections , and possibly contribute to an explanation of the above discrepancy ( see e.g horowitz et al .",
    "@xcite ) to a great extent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a detailed investigation of the @xmath15 and @xmath19 reactions using a fully relativistic feynman diagram technique .",
    "we carry out our calculations within an effective one - boson exchange ( obe ) nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) scattering mechanism , which includes both nucleon and delta isobar excitations in the intermediate states .",
    "we consider the exchange of @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 , and @xmath17 mesons .",
    "most of the parameters of the obe model are determined by fitting to the n - n scattering data @xcite .",
    "different delta isobar propagators proposed in the literature @xcite have been examined in order to remove the confusion about their most appropriate form .",
    "the relative importance of the contributions of different exchanged meson in the energy range 300 @xmath0 to 2.0 @xmath1 has been discussed .    in the next section ,",
    "we give the details of our model and derive the expressions of various amplitudes .",
    "the comparison of our calculations with the experimental data and the discussion of the results are presented in section 3 .",
    "the summary and conclusions of our work are presented in section 4 .",
    "to obtain the desired production cross section for the @xmath14 processes , we use a fully covariant method based on an effective one - boson - exchange model which describes at the same time the elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "pions are simply produced from the external nucleon lines ( see figs .",
    "1a - 1d ) or if possible , also from the internal meson lines ( figs .",
    "the pion production via formation , propagation and the subsequent decay of the delta isobar is included .",
    "it may be noted that in fig .",
    "1 we have not shown the so called pre - emisson diagrams . however , in actual calculations their contributions are also included .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is described by the exchange of @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 mesons in term of which we parametrize the t - matrix .",

    "the form factor supresses the contributions of high momenta and the parameter @xmath41 , which governs the range of suppression , can be directly related to the hadron size . since the data in the entire range of beam energies can not be reproduced with an energy independent set of parameters , we have used the following energy dependence for the coupling constants @xmath42 the parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and @xmath44 ) were determined @xcite by fitting to the relevant proton - proton and proton - neutron data at three beam energies of 1.73 @xmath1 , 2.24 @xmath1 , and 3.18 @xmath1 , where a good fit to the elastic scattering amplitudes were obtained .",

    "the dashed lines represent the results obtained by including only those graphs where pion production proceeds via intermediate delta isobar states , while the dashed - dotted lines give the results with only nucleon intermediate states .",
    "the solid lines shows the results where all the graphs are included .",
    "we note that the measured cross sections are reproduced reasonably well by our calculations in the entire range of beam energies .",
    "this is remarkable in view of the fact that none of the parameters of the model have been adjusted to the pion production data .",

    "the same set of parameters ( with an energy dependence of the coupling constants given by eq .",
    "( 11 ) seems to reproduce the data at low energies as well .",
    "the contribution of the delta isobar excitation is not important at beam energies below approximately 350 @xmath0 , which is due to the fact that at lower energies pions are predominantly in a relative @xmath113-state ; thus the possibility of forming a delta isobar is greatly reduced . however , the pion production is dominated by the @xmath61 isobar excitation at higher beam energies .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the contribution of various meson exchange processes to the total cross section of the @xmath114 reaction in the considered range of beam energies .",
    "the contributions of the heavy axial meson exchange are not shown in this figure as they are negligibly small .",
    "we note that the pion exchange graphs dominate the production process for all the energies .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath21 meson exchange is almost negligible at lower beam energies , and even in the energy range of 1 - 2 @xmath1 , it is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of the pion exchange process .",
    "dmitriev et al .",
    "@xcite have made the similar observation for the reaction @xmath115 within a similar type of model .",
    "this lends a _ posteriori _ credence to the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath116 reaction within a covariant two - nucleon model at a beam energy of 800 @xmath0 , where only one - pion exchange intermediate processes were considered .    at the incident energies very close to the pion production threshold the contributions of the @xmath5 and @xmath17 meson exchange are as strong as that of the pion exchange .",
    "therefore calculations , which do not include these mesons , underestimate the pion production cross sections near the threshold ( see eg .",
    "horowitz et al . in [ 13 ] , and @xcite ) .    as we note from table 1 , the cut - off parameters @xmath41 must have values in the range of 1.0 - 1.6 @xmath1 in order to fit the nn scattering data .",
    "similar values for this parameter have been used in almost all the earlier calculations@xcite of the proton induced pion production ( which mostly included only pion exchange contributions , requiring therefore only @xmath117 and @xmath118 which were taken to be the same ) . in fig .",
    "4 we show the total cross sections for the @xmath119 reaction as a function of beam energy for two values of @xmath117 . the solid and",
    "the long dashed lines show the results obtained with values 1.005 @xmath1 and 0.63 @xmath1 respectively for this parameter .",
    "it is apparent that the latter value of @xmath117 leads to a smaller cross section and a poorer fit to the data .",
    "smaller values of @xmath41 imply a reduction in the range of the pion exchange contribution to the nn interactions which reduces its contribution to the pion production cross section as this is the dominant process as has been discussed earlier .",
    "although a value of @xmath120 is consistent with the chiral bag model @xcite , the quantitative description of the nn data requires a value @xmath121 1.0 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we therefore , stick to the value of @xmath117 as shown in table 1 .    in fig . 5 , we investigate the effect of using the pseudoscalar coupling for the @xmath122 vertex on the @xmath73 production cross section . in this figure",
    "we show the ratio of the total cross sections obtained by using the pseudovector ( @xmath123 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath124 ) couplings for the @xmath122 vertex as a function of beam energy .",
    "the solid line represents the results obtained by including all the graphs while the long dashed line give the results obtained with only nucleon intermediate excitations .",
    "it is clear that the pion production is enhanced if the pseudoscalar coupling is used .",
    "this effect is very large at lower beam energies . at higher beam energies ,",
    "where @xmath61 isobar excitation dominates , this effect still persists even when all the graphs are included in the calculations .    in the one pion exchange picture of the nn interaction , when both nucleon are on the mass shell",
    ", it will not be possible to make a difference between the pseudovector and pseudoscalar couplings , as both will produce the same result .",
    "however , in fig . 1 , one of the nucleons can go off - shell .",
    "therefore , in this case the two couplings will produce different results .",
    "one can show ( taking the case of just one diagram , say for example fig .",
    "1a ) that the ratio of the amplitudes obtained by using pseudovector and psedoscalar couplings is given approximately by @xmath125 . at lower beam energies",
    "this ratio is very small , which explains to some the extent the trend seen in fig .",
    "5 .    in general",
    ", the pseudovector coupling for the @xmath23 vertex is preferred .",
    "the @xmath126-wave interaction between pions and nucleons is very strong and attractive ; the formation of the @xmath61 isobar is the consequence of this interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath127-wave interaction is very weak .",
    "the pseudovector coupling automatically incorporates these features due to the derivative term .",
    "one can show purely on formal grounds that it is also consistent with the constraint imposed by the pcac hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the derivative of the axial vector current operator based on the pseudovector @xmath6 coupling vanishes as the pion mass goes to zero .",
    "the pseudoscalar coupling does not satisfy this criterion ; it also produces a @xmath127-wave interaction which is much too strong @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this coupling has a history of problems in dirac calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not consider the pseudoscalar couplings for the @xmath6 vertex in our calculations .",
    "we have also calculated the double differential cross sections for the @xmath128 reactions and have compared the results with one set of existing experimental data @xcite at the proton incident energy of 800 @xmath0 , in fig . 6 ; this set of data were also analysed by verwest @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the contributions of the delta isobar excitation ( dashed lines ) dominate the total cross sections ( solid lines ) , whereas those of the nucleon intermediate state ( dotted lines ) are very small .",
    "the agreement between theory and the data is reasonably good at forward pion angles .",
    "however , at higher pion angles our calculations overpredict the data by factors of 1.5 to 2 .",
    "the peak cross sections are affected by the different multipolarities ( dipole or monopole ) of the form - factors ( eq .",
    "( 10 ) - ( 11 ) ) and forms of the delta decay width @xmath129 ( eq . ( 15 ) ) .",
    "for instance , with a monopole form factor for the the @xmath130 vertex , the cross sections near the peak are reduced by approximately 20 @xmath131 . on the other hand , using the width @xmath132 enhances the cross sections near the peak region further by about 5 - 6 @xmath131 .",
    "there is , therefore , some scope to explain the small disagreement between data and out calculations at larger pion angles .",
    "this also indicates that these measurments may be useful in differentiating between various forms of the formfactors and delta decay widths .",
    "the experimental points towards the larger momentum ends of the spectra come from the processes like @xmath133 final states which is obviously not included in our calculations .",
    "we now compare our results with data taken in kinematically complete measurments where all the three particles in the final channels are measured . in fig .",
    "7 , we present a comparison of our calculations with the data @xcite for the triple differential cross sections for two sets of pion and proton angles as a function of outgoing proton momentum at the beam energy of 800 @xmath0 .",
    "the peak reagion in this figure corresponds to the final state proton momenta associated with the formation of the delta isobar and its decay .",
    "the solid lines ( dashed lines ) in this figure show the results of calculations which include the contributions of all the graphs ( only delta isobar intermediate states ) . clearly the peak region is dominated by the delta excitation process . at higher angles and in the regions away from the delta excitation peak , the contributions of nucleon excitation are not negligible as can be seen in the lower part of this figure .",
    "the shift in the peak position towards higher momenta at larger angles is due to the fact that at larger pion angles the delta isobar formation is associated with larger outgoing pion momenta .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the position of the peak in the calculated cross sections is shifted towards somewhat larger momenta as compared to the experimental data .",
    "obviously the form of the delta decay width will play a crucial role in determining the peak position . in fig .",
    "7 we have used the decay width @xmath132 .",
    "the effect of using other forms of the deacay width is shown in fig .",
    "8 , where the solid lines represent the results of the calculations performed with the delta decay width of verwest , while the dashed lines corresponds to that of dmitriev .",
    "the short dashed lines show the results obtained with dmitriev s form but with a value of @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "we see that the peak positions of the experimental cross sections are correctly reproduced by calculations using the decay width of dmitriev .",
    "hoewever , the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections are a bit too high at larger pion angles .",
    "in this paper we have presented a fully covariant one - boson exchange model to describe the @xmath15 and @xmath19 reactions in the beam energy ( @xmath135 ) range of 300 mev to 2 gev .",
    "the model contains only the physical parameters ( like coupling constants and cutoff masses ) , which were determined by fiting to the nn elastic scattering data at three beam energies above 1 @xmath1 .",
    "all the parameters so determined were held fixed throughout the considered energy range ; none of the parameters were adjusted to the pion production data of any kind .",
    "we considered the exchange of the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath5 and @xmath17 mesons ; the latter two were not considered in earlier calculations of the @xmath18 processes .",
    "the calculations included pre- and post - emission graphs and considered the excitation of both the delta isobar and nucleon intermediate states .",
    "the deacy of the @xmath21 meson in flight ( the so - called intermediate emission diagram ) was also incorporated in our calculations .",
    "we found that the pion exchange processes dominate the cross sections in the entire energy region .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath21 meson exchange is almost negligible at lower beam energies . even in the energy range of",
    "1 - 2 @xmath1 its contribution is less than 10 @xmath131 .",
    "this is an important observation as it implies that in the description of the @xmath13 reaction at beam energies around 1 @xmath1 within the covariant two nucleon model , it suffices to consider only pion exchange intermediate states , which reduces the intricacy of the calculations quite a bit @xcite .",
    "the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath17 mesons is important for beam energies closer to the pion production threshold , while at intermediate and higher beam energies their contributions are of the same order of magnitude as that of the @xmath21 meson exchange .",
    "therefore , it would be important to include the exchange of both @xmath5 and @xmath17 mesons in order to explain the near threshold data on pion production in @xmath136 collisions taken recently at the bloomington cooler cyclotron @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a fully covariant calculation is necessary at even these energies because the non - relativistic reduction of the @xmath6 lagrangian has ambiguities , which cast doubt on the results obtained within such approaches@xcite .",
    "the excitation and decay of the delta isobar dominates the pion production processes at @xmath137 where it accounts for almost entire cross sections on its own .",
    "however , this process is not important for lower beam energies ; it contributes almost negligibly to pion production near the threshold .",
    "we have also reviewed the derivation of the covariant delta isobar propagator and have showed that the propagator given by williams does not represent the correct propagator for a massive spin-@xmath138 field .",
    "this point was further stressed by performing numerical calculations with this propagator .",
    "we have found that the williams propagator leads to very large cross sections ( which look almost like a pole ) for total as well as differential cross sections in certain energy regions which is clearly unphysical .",
    "the calculations performed with a pseudoscalar coupling for the @xmath6 vertex were found to produce too large cross sections particularly near the pion production threshold .",
    "this is due to the fact that pseudoscalar coupling alone ( without any @xmath139 coupling ) produces a much too large @xmath113-wave @xmath140 interaction , which dominates the pion production near the threshold .",
    "however , this is clearly not in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the pseudoscalar coupling is not consistent with the constraints of the pcac .",
    "therefore , we have preferred to use the pseudovector couplings in our calculations .",
    "we have also analysed the available double and triple differential cross sections for pion production and found that our model provides a reasonable description of these data as well .",
    "the triple differential cross sections are sensitive to the form of the momentum dependent delta decay widths and probably also to the form of the cut - off parameters .",
    "as there are many versions of this width available in the literature , the complete kinematical detection of three particles in the final channel may perhaps help in making distinction between them .",
    "this would lead to a better understanding of the off - shell behaviour of the delta isobar @xcite .    in this work we established a covariant framework to describe the inelastic channels of the nn collisions . and used this to investigated the strongest of them , the pion emission .",
    "this should now form the basis for the study of relatively weaker inelastic processes like emission of @xmath141 mesons and also the @xmath142 meson which is thought to provide a novel tool to study the baryonic resonances around 2 @xmath1 @xcite",
    "by using the complicated but straight - forward algebra of @xmath143 matrices and the dirac equation for a free particle the amplitudes given in subsection ( 2.3 ) can be rewritten into relatively simple forms which are suitable for numerical calculations .",

    "@xcite , it has been shown that the propagator @xmath155 has no inverse , and thus it can not be the propagator of a spin-@xmath138 particle .",
    "a similar difficulty is associated with the propagator suggested by adelseck et al .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "9a and 9b , we study the effect of using the two delta isobar propagators @xmath153 and @xmath155 in the calculations of the total and triple differential cross sections for the @xmath119 reaction to stress further the difficulties associated with the williams propagator .",
    "the solid lines show the results obtained by using the former propagator while the dashed line the later one .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath155 produces very large cross sections in a certain range of beam energies due to the fact that the factor @xmath193 present in the demoninators of some terms of this propagator , becomes very small .",
    "this effect is particularly very strong for the pre - emission graphs .",
    "for example , for such a graph which is analogous to fig .",
    "1a we have @xmath194 it can be seen that for @xmath195 , @xmath67 is very close to zero .",
    "this energy corresponds to an incident proton energy of approximatly of 1.2 @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , at incident energies around this value the terms which are proportional to @xmath196 in @xmath155 become very large in the pre - emision graphs which in turn leads to huge total cross sections . in the post - emission graphs this problem is not so severe .",
    "this very clearly shows the difficulty that one encounters while using the propagator @xmath155 . it must be mentioned here that normally the contributions of pre - emission graphs are much smaller than those of the post - emission ones if one uses the propagator @xmath153 .",
    "the effect of using @xmath155 is very drastic in case of triple differential cross sections as can be seen in fig .",
    "williams propagator leads to a very large cross section ( which looks almost like a pole ) at certain value of the outgoing pion momenta due to the same reason as discussed above .",
