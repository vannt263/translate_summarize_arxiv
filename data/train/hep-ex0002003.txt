    "recent results from a number of independent experiments  @xcite can be interpreted as due to finite neutrino masses and , in particular , high statistics measurements of atmospheric neutrinos by the super - kamiokande@xcite experiment are regarded by most as firm evidence that neutrinos have non - zero masses .",
    "+ while these measurements , based on oscillations , have set the stage for a systematic study of the intrinsic neutrino properties , only upper - limits exist on the absolute magnitude of neutrino masses .",
    "indeed , theoretical models span a large range of scenarios , from the degenerate case where mass differences among flavors are small with respect to the absolute mass scale  @xcite , to the hierarchical , where mass differences are of the same order as the mass themselves .",
    "however , while the neutrino mass scale is unknown , the present data on oscillations lead rather naturally to masses in the range @xmath3  ev , as shown recently , e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "+ it is unlikely that direct neutrino mass measurements , most notably with tritium  @xcite , will be able to reach sensitivities substantially below 1  ev in the near future .",
    "in contrast , we will show that a large double-@xmath4 decay experiment using isotopically enriched @xmath5can reach a sensitivity corresponding to neutrino masses as low as @xmath00.01  ev .",
    "a xenon detector offers the unique possibility of identifying the final state , thus providing an essentially background - free measurement of unprecedented sensitivity for the neutrino mass .",
    "it is well known that neutrinoless double beta decay , @xmath6 , can proceed only if neutrinos are massive majorana particles . if the @xmath6occurs , the _ effective _ majorana neutrino mass @xmath7 is related to the half - life @xmath8 as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a known phase space factor depending on the end - point energy @xmath11 and the nuclear charge @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the gamow - teller and fermi nuclear matrix elements for the process . here we have defined @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , and @xmath17 the masses of the individual majorana neutrinos .",
    "hence , although difficulties in the nuclear models used to calculate the matrix elements give some uncertainty on the value of @xmath7 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath6decay is sensitive to the masses of all neutrino flavors , provided that the mixing angles are non - negligible .",
    "at present the best sensitivities to @xmath6decay have been reached with @xmath18 diode ionization counters with an exposure of 24.16  kg  yr  @xcite and with a @xmath2 time projection chamber ( tpc ) with an exposure of 4.87  kg  yr  @xcite .",
    "the measured half - life limits of @xmath19  yrs for germanium and @xmath20  yrs for xenon can be interpreted as neutrino mass limits of , respectively , @xmath21  ev and @xmath22  ev using the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa )  @xcite ( shell model ( nsm )  @xcite ) for the nuclear matrix element calculation .",
    "the germanium detector rejects background on the basis of its excellent energy resolution and of pulse - shape discrimination  @xcite and has recently reported a specific background as low as 0.3  kg@xmath23  yr@xmath23  fwhm@xmath23 . the relatively inferior energy resolution in tpcs",
    "have been complemented by superior tracking capabilities that allow the xenon experiment to partially reconstruct the two - electron topology of @xmath24-decay , obtaining a specific background of 2.5  kg@xmath23  yr@xmath23  fwhm@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "none of these backgrounds is sufficient for a decisive experiment in the interesting region discussed above .",
    "for that , it is essential to find a reliable way to drastically increase the size of the detectors while , simultaneously , reducing the backgrounds .",
    "this dual requirement stems from the fact that in a background - free experiment the neutrino mass sensitivity scales as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the measurement time and @xmath27 the number of nuclei under study . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "when the background scales with @xmath28 , the neutrino mass sensitivity would scale only as @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , the backgrounds observed in all current experiments will become the true limiting factor of any kind of future large experiment , hampering the full utilization of very large masses of @xmath24 emitters .",
    "unlike other isotopes , however , @xmath5allows for direct tagging of the ba - ion final state using optical spectroscopy , as pointed - out for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "while this technique can not discriminate between @xmath6and @xmath30-decays , this second process is not the dominant background at the sensitivities sought here and can be eliminated by kinematical reconstruction in a xenon tpc .",
    "moreover , xenon is one of the easiest isotopes to enrich , and like argon can be used as active medium in ionization chambers .",
    "hence , an experiment with xenon can use an entirely new variable in order to drastically reduce the backgrounds and explore the range of interesting neutrino masses .",
    "the @xmath24-decay of @xmath5produces a ba@xmath31 ion in the final state that can be readily neutralized to ba@xmath32 by an appropriate secondary gas in the tpc .",
    "the barium ion can then be individually detected through its laser - induced fluorescence .",
    "single ba@xmath32 ions were first observed in 1978  @xcite using a radio frequency quadrupole trap and laser cooling .",
    "+    the level structure of the alkali - like ba@xmath32 ion is shown in figure  [ fig : ba_levels ] . due to",
    "the strong 493  nm allowed transition ground - state ions can be optically excited to the @xmath33 state from where they have substantial branching ratio ( 30% ) to decay into the meta - stable @xmath34 state .",
    "specific ba@xmath32 detection is then achieved by exciting the system back into the @xmath33 state with 650  nm radiation and observing the blue photon from the decay to the ground state ( 70% branching ratio ) .",
    "this transition has a spontaneous lifetime of 8  ns and when saturated will radiate @xmath35  photons / s .",
    "a pair of lasers tuned onto the appropriate frequencies and simultaneously steered to the place where the @xmath24-decay candidate event is found can provide a very selective validation , effectively providing a new independent constraint to be used in @xmath24-decay background subtraction .",
    "the light from the p to s transition conveniently lays in the region of maximum quantum efficiency of bialkali photocathodes so that an array of conventional large - area photomultipliers can be used for the detection .",
    "the very large saturation rate makes the experiment possible even with modest photocathode angular coverage . while it is possible in principle to steer the lasers anywhere inside the tpc , the very large volume and the need for light baffling may favor a scheme in which the ba@xmath32 drift in the large electric field is used to bring the ion in specific laser detection regions .    the primary difference between the single atom work done previously and this experiment is that here the @xmath1 ion is not in vacuum but rather in a buffer gas ( xe ) at a pressure of several atmospheres .",
    "the high pressure xenon has two effects : first , it effectively traps the barium since diffusion in the dense gas is sufficient to confine the atoms for long enough time to obtain a signal ; second , it pressure broadens the optical transitions increasing the laser power required . we calculate that at 5  atm the barium ion will diffuse only @xmath36  mm in 1  s , and during this time it can be cycled over @xmath37 times through the three - level scheme of figure  [ fig : ba_levels ] , emitting more than @xmath37 493  nm photons .",
    "the ion drift in the electric field of the tpc can be accurately measured and corrected for in the process of steering the lasers . for the moment we notice that drift velocities of tl@xmath32 in xe have been measured  @xcite and are low enough to make the correction possible .",
    "we also find from preliminary calculations that at the same pressure the broadened line - width is @xmath38  ghz , 1000 times greater than the natural line - width .",
    "this results in a saturation intensity of @xmath39  w/@xmath40 .",
    "ba@xmath32 lifetime , together with pressure broadening of the lines involved , and the lifetime of the @xmath34 state , will have to be measured in xenon before the detection system can be fully optimized .",
    "however , measurements on the corresponding neutral ba states at 0.5  atm in he and ar  @xcite show that operations at 5 to 10  atm should be possible .",
    "among the different gas ionization detectors known , a tpc is the ideal detector for @xmath24-decay as it has no wires or other materials in the detection volume hence reducing the background internal to the detector and simplifying the laser scanning .",
    "the requirements of size , efficiency for contained events , energy , and spatial resolution can be achieved with a large ( 40  m@xmath41 ) gas - phase tpc with xenon .",
    "tpcs of similar size at atmospheric pressure are successfully in operation  @xcite , in one case with some 10  kg of @xmath5  @xcite . a 5 to 10  atm",
    ", 40  m@xmath41 chamber would contain 1 to 2  tons of @xmath5and is within the reach of current state - of - the - art technology .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of the technique is probably limited by the practical availability of @xmath5that represents 8.9% of natural xenon and has to be extracted by isotopic separation . while the isotopic separation is indeed one of the main challenges of the experiment , in the case of @xmath5this operation is simplified by the fact that xenon is a gas at standard conditions , and essentially any known separation technology can be used .",
    "relatively large amounts of @xmath5have been obtained in the past by ultracentrifugation  @xcite with purities sufficient for the experiment described  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5handling is simplified by its inert character that allows for the extraction of cosmogenically produced elements with distillation and chemical filtering that can be carried - on in the underground laboratory prior ( and during ) the operation of the experiment .",
    "an experiment with up to 10  tons of @xmath5is consistent with the availability of xenon on the world market  @xcite and can be setup by assembling a few tpc modules inside a single pressure vessel or , possibly , by increasing the pressure and/or volume of a single chamber .",
    "the use of liquid - xenon ( lxe ) in a tpc would result in a very compact detector with considerable advantages .",
    "however the range of 1.2  mev electrons from the @xmath6-decay in lxe is only of 2.4  mm so that , given any conceivable spatial resolution , the topological information , essential for background rejection , would be lost .",
    "in contrast , at room temperature 5  atm of xenon gas correspond to a density of 30",
    "g / l and an electron range of 21.6  cm at 1.2  mev . in figure",
    "[ fig : tpc_mech ] we show a possible scheme for the @xmath24-decay detector . + it is known  @xcite that it is quite difficult to obtain electron multiplication and stable operation in xenon chambers .",
    "this is due to the far uv scintillation light ( @xmath42  nm corresponding to 6.93  ev ) , copiously produced with the multiplication process , that in turn ionizes the gas and extracts electrons from the metallic surfaces . in our case",
    "this particular requirement is greatly relaxed by the use of gas micropattern detector  @xcite planes instead of a more conventional anode wire array for the chamber readout , drastically limiting the solid angle available for the uv radiation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the chamber will also use a quencher gas , able to absorb the xenon scintillation uv and re - emit light in the blue or green so that timing information can be recovered using the photomultipliers and the event can be localized also in the third ( time ) coordinate .",
    "a field of @xmath01  kv / cm will be needed in order to achieve high drift velocity for electrons in xenon . while this field strength is not sufficient to neutralize ba@xmath31 to ba@xmath32 , an appropriate choice of ionization potential ( ip ) for the quencher gas can achieve this purpose .",
    "ips between 5.2  ev ( ba ) and 10.001  ev ( ba@xmath32 ) are found in several organic molecules that would provide a stable environment for ba@xmath32 .",
    "molecules like tma ( @xmath43 ) , tea ( @xmath44 ) , tmg ( @xmath45 ) and tms ( @xmath46 ) are candidates fulfilling the above requirements .",
    "an underground site with an overburden of @xmath47  mwe ( meter water equivalent ) will reduce the cosmic ray muon flux to @xmath48 , corresponding to less than 0.1  hz through the detector .",
    "muons recorded in the tpc have a distinctive signature and indeed were observed and rejected by the gotthard group  @xcite based on track length , lack of scattering ( high energy ) , and specific ionization .",
    "the last two features provide good discrimination even for tracks that clip a small corner of the chamber .",
    "the online trigger processor will be able to analyze and reject most muon tracks without activating the laser ba - tagging system . based on simple geometrical considerations we expect the laser system to be activated by muon tracks less than once per hour .",
    "some background will be produced by neutrons produced by muon spallation in the structures ( rock and other materials ) outside the detector .",
    "these fast neutrons enter the detector with some efficiency and produce spallation reactions on the xenon , carbon and hydrogen nuclei contained in the tpc . while the original muon and the neutron trail go undetected , the spallation processes provide very distinct high ionization , short tracks and can be distinguished and rejected even at trigger level . hence at the depth considered the detector does not need an active veto counter , as already found by the gotthard group . + more serious are the @xmath49-ray backgrounds from natural radioactivity , either produced outside the tpc ( mainly by the rock or concrete ) , or inside ( mainly @xmath50rn and , possibly , @xmath51kr and @xmath52ar ) .",
    "external @xmath49-ray backgrounds from the rock and concrete can be attenuated by a @xmath025  cm thick lead or steel enclosure and by the 1  cm thick pressure vessel that will be built out of low - activity steel .",
    "additionally , cleaner shielding could be provided , if needed . in the following",
    "we conservatively assume that the tpc itself ( without ba - tagging system ) will have the same specific rate of mis - identified background as the gotthard experiment , and we rely on ba - tagging for the final step of reduction .",
    "this hypothesis is conservative since the larger volume of our tpc provides better self shielding for the radiation produced externally .",
    "we estimate the position and energy resolution of our chamber from an extrapolation using the gotthard tpc . assuming a drift velocity similar to the one in gotthard and a drift distance of 250  cm ( 3.6 times larger than the gotthard case ) we obtain transverse and longitudinal position resolutions ( @xmath53 ) of better than 5  mm .",
    "this figure should give us roughly the same background suppression factor as obtained at gotthard , since the electron range is 21  cm .",
    "furthermore , unlike in the case of the gotthard experiment , the knowledge of the time of occurrence will provide longitudinal localization of each event , improving the understanding of external backgrounds and allowing for a longitudinal fiducial volume cut .",
    "+ energy resolution should be no worse than the @xmath54 ( at 1.592  mev ) obtained at gotthard , since in addition to the total charge , also the scintillation light will be collected @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using the laser tagging system with a small spot - size in a `` raster scan '' mode around the event location , will localize the decay vertex with mm precision and allow a full kinematical fit including energy , angular correlation and range for _ each _ of the electrons .",
    "it is expected that substantial improvement in energy resolution and background rejection will be possible in this way .",
    "+ while the quantitative advantage of each of the techniques discussed will be better understood after extensive laboratory tests and a full monte carlo simulation , here we simply assume that the above methods , together with the ba@xmath32 identification , will reduce the sum of all radioactivity backgrounds by at least three orders of magnitude with respect to the gotthard case , making a 10-ton @xmath5experiment essentially background free .",
    "from the size and geometry of the chamber we obtain an efficiency for fully contained events of 70% . in table",
    "[ tab : performance ] we compare the projected sensitivity of this experiment with the present limits on @xmath6decay .",
    ".comparison of the best present double - beta decay experiments and the project described here .",
    "the technique of ba@xmath32 tagging will reduce the background , given in units of kg@xmath23  yr@xmath23  fwhm@xmath23 if not noted otherwise , to the level necessary to fully utilize the large mass of isotopic species .",
    "all other experimental parameters are assumed to be the same as in the gotthard experiment .",
    "we list here , together , the case of an initial detector with 1  ton of @xmath5and the final results possible with 10  tons of @xmath5and a very long ( 10 years ) data - taking period .",
    "the quantities marked with @xmath55 are radioactivity backgrounds that are assumed to be negligible as discussed in the text .",
    "in addition the background from mis - identified @xmath30decays is also shown in total events in each exposure using the asymmetric analysis interval described in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting to note that for the very large isotopic masses contemplated here , the background on @xmath6decay from the well known @xmath30mode has to be carefully estimated .",
    "as already remarked this `` background '' is not directly suppressed by the laser tagging methods . however , the energy spectra of the electrons that represent the only distinctive feature of this background will be better measured thanks to the better knowledge of the event kinematics . in the following",
    "we will conservatively disregard this additional information and suppress the @xmath30mode using total energy information , with the resolution mentioned above . in order to understand the role of the resolution we select events in the two intervals @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we then compute the number of @xmath30decay events  @xcite left in each case .",
    "for @xmath58 we have 23  @xmath59 left in @xmath60 and 0.36  @xmath59 left in @xmath61 . a better resolution of @xmath62 is used in the 10  ton  -  10  yr exposure in table  [ tab : performance ] . the loss in efficiency due to the asymmetric cut ( and to the tails beyond @xmath63 ) are taken into account in the table as appropriate .",
    "it is clear , however , that our estimate is quite conservative as the @xmath30decay background will be further suppressed by the kinematic fitting .",
    "the projected neutrino mass sensitivity of 10 - 50  mev would make the discussed experiment competitive with other large scale double beta searches which have been proposed .",
    "nemo3 is scheduled to start data taking in 2001 with initially 7  kg of @xmath64mo and 1  kg of @xmath65se in form of passive source foils in a gas tracking detector utilizing a magnetic field and a scintillator calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "a neutrino mass sensitivity of 0.1  ev is expected after 5 years .",
    "the ultimate goal is to run with 20 kg of @xmath65se , @xmath64mo or @xmath66nd in order to measure an effective neutrino mass below 0.1  ev .",
    "a large cryogenic detector ( cuore ) , able to operate 600 kg of teo@xmath67 crystals , could be used to search for the @xmath6decay of @xmath68",
    ". a neutrino mass sensitivity of around 0.1 ev has been quoted for this device @xcite .",
    "the proponents of the genius project propose to use up to one ton of isotopically enriched @xmath69ge suspended in a large tank of liquid nitrogen @xcite .",
    "the goal is to reach a mass sensitivity of around 0.01 ev .",
    "the latter two are calorimetric approaches .",
    "however , it has to be pointed out that the experiment discussed in this paper is the only one among those third generation projects which plans to utilize a novel technique for background suppression in the form of ba tagging .    in summary ,",
    "we have described an advanced @xmath24 detector system that uses a hybrid of atomic and particle physics techniques to qualitatively improve background suppression .",
    "such detector opens new possibilities in using massive amounts of @xmath5for an advanced @xmath24-decay experiment that would explore neutrino masses in the range 10 - 50  mev , providing a unique opportunity for discoveries in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "we would like to specially thank f. boehm for the help and guidance received in formulating much of this paper .",
    "we also owe gratitude to u.  becker , s.  chu , h.  henrikson , l.  ropelewski , t.  thurston and r. zare for many useful discussions .",
