    "transition - metal compounds display a wide variety of exciting phenomena such as high-@xmath1 superconductivity , colossal magneto resistance , and metal - insulator transitions resulting from the strong interplay between the charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "knowledge of the electronic and magnetic structure can be obtained by a variety of spectroscopic techniques , such as optical spectroscopy , photoemission , x - ray absorption .",
    "a general understanding of spectroscopy and its uses has always been a crucial aspect in the advancement of condensed - matter physics .",
    "recently , inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) , both on and off resonance , has attracted considerable attention .",
    "resonant ixs ( rixs ) @xcite is a second - order process dominated by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the momentum and @xmath4 the vector potential .",
    "the incoming x ray excites an electron from a deep - lying core state into the valence shell , and one measures the radiative decay of the core hole .",
    "for rixs at the transition - metal @xmath5 and @xmath6 edges , the dipole transitions create @xmath0 excitations that include spin - flips due to the strong intermediate - state spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the transitions can be described with an effective operator approach @xcite in the fast - collision approximation .",
    "rixs at the @xmath7 edge , where excitations are predominantly shake - up processes by the strong @xmath8 core potential @xcite , can be related in certain limits to the dynamic structure factor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "nonresonant ixs , on the other hand , involves the interaction @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization and wave vectors of the incoming / outgoing x rays , respectively .",
    "the interaction due to the @xmath14 term is in principle weak .",
    "however , the successful experiments by larson et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the feasibility of measuring local @xmath0 excitations and comparison of the radial matrix elements indicate that these transitions can in principle also be observed in other transition - metal and rare - earth compounds .",
    "the appealing feature of nonresonant ixs is that the cross section is proportional to the dynamic structure factor : @xmath15 , which through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is connected to the imaginary part of the density response function , @xmath16 with @xmath17 the ground state energy and where the hamiltonian @xmath18 , for transition - metal compounds , includes strong many - body interactions ; @xmath19 is the density operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 creates an electron in a state @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the band index and @xmath24 . without matrix elements @xmath19 becomes equivalent to the charge density operator @xmath25 .",
    "however , matrix elements play a crucial role in the understanding of the inelastic scattering . using wannier functions",
    ", we can rewrite the matrix element in terms of scattering from an atom at site @xmath26 to a site @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a localized wannier orbital of type @xmath29 at site @xmath27 . the operator @xmath19 can create charge - transfer transitions ( with @xmath30 ) , plasmon excitations @xcite , and dipolar and higher - order transitions from core to valence states ( where @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated @xcite that it is also possible to measure dipolar forbidden @xmath0 transitions . by tuning the transferred momentum @xcite ,",
    "one is able to maximize the intensity for local transitions ( @xmath32 within the @xmath33 shell , for which the matrix element is @xmath34 where @xmath29 denotes the different @xmath33 orbitals .",
    "this approximation assumes reasonably well localized warnier orbitals .",
    "these sharp dipole - forbidden transitions were first observed by larson _",
    "@xcite for large @xmath35 in nio and coo .",
    "the use of large wave vectors would allow a resolution of 30 mev or less , making nonresonant ixs a promising tool to study local crystal field and orbiton excitations .",
    "it could be used , for example , to study the jahn - teller distortions in manganites and the nature of the small crystal field distortions in early transition - metal oxides .",
    "although the angular dependence in nio and coo has been analyzed with density - functional theory @xcite and small - cluster calculations @xcite , the detailed nature of the angular dependence and how to use it is not well understood . in this paper",
    ", we express @xmath19 as an effective operator , derive the selection rules governing the local @xmath0 transitions , and give explicit angular dependencies .",
    "we provide an explanation for the remarkable intensity variations in certain directions .",
    "the derivation for the angular distribution of the intensities is partially based on symmetry rules and should therefor be very generally valid .",
    "we show how ixs can be used to extract detailed ground - state information by treating the ixs from orbitons ( excitonic orbital excitations not involving the hubbard u ) in manganites .",
    "for local @xmath0 transitions , it is convenient to express the @xmath33 wannier functions @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in terms of a radial function @xmath39 and a real angular part @xmath40 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ; @xmath46 is a spherical harmonic .",

    "this selection rule helps us to obtain an understanding of nonresonant ixs . as an example , let us consider a cu@xmath96 ion in @xmath97 symmetry for quadrupolar ( @xmath98 ) scattering .",
    "the ground state is @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , where the underline indicates holes .",
    "when measuring along the @xmath101 $ ] direction , the only nonzero angular term is @xmath102 ( @xmath44 ) , where we use @xmath74 in conventional spherical coordinates @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "there is no inelastic scattering , since the relevant transition operator @xmath103 only contributes to the elastic intensity ( @xmath104 ) .",

    ", @xmath107 gives elastic scattering ; @xmath108 does not contribute since transitions to @xmath109 are forbidden since @xmath110 is not satisfied for @xmath95 and @xmath93 for @xmath33 electrons .",
    "the only inelastic scattering is due to @xmath111 giving @xmath112 @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) with a @xmath115 angular dependence .",
    "in addition , we can easily see that transitions @xmath116",
    "( @xmath117 ) are possible for operators with symmetry @xmath118 and @xmath119 using the inverse relationship @xmath120 .",
    "however , @xmath118 does not satisfy the condition that @xmath121 for @xmath122 and is therefore not allowed .",
    "the transition @xmath116 is therefore hexadecapolar ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) .",
    "although all the off - diagonal terms for the quadrupolar scattering are determined by a single @xmath6 , often two different @xmath6 values interfere .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define a total angular dependence between two @xmath33 orbitals by @xmath125 , which are given in table [ angular ] .",
    "we now demonstrate how the selection rules and symmetry can help in extracting valuable ground - state information .",
    "one of the striking features of nonresonant inelastic x - ray scattering in nio is the presence of a [ 001 ] nodal direction absent in coo .",
    "@xcite ascribed this to a `` @xmath55-selection rule '' associated with the nearly cubic point group symmetry of nio .",

    ", this rarely happens , but @xmath19 can commute with parts of the hamiltonian , which then might give rise to nodal directions for all excited states if @xmath127 and otherwise gives a nodal direction for the excited states for which @xmath129 . below we will first discuss the commutation relations between @xmath19 and the crystal - field operator and then those with the coulomb interaction . for @xmath130 , the only nonzero angular dependence",
    "@xmath131 selects the operators @xmath132 .",
    "this gives a density operator diagonal in @xmath66 , @xmath133 with @xmath134 in several common crystal - fields , such as @xmath135 and @xmath97 , @xmath66 is a good quantum number and therefore @xmath136 commutes with the crystal - field operator . along @xmath137 $ ] , @xmath138 is no longer diagonal but , since it is a unitary transformation over @xmath139 of @xmath140 , still only contains @xmath141 and @xmath142 , but no @xmath143 scattering .",
    "eigenstates of the octahedral crystal field therefore scatter among themselves .",
    "thus , for a system with a @xmath135 or @xmath97 symmetry a nodal direction can occur when @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is a fourfold symmetry axis . since in general @xmath19 does not commute with the coulomb interaction , the eigenstate of the crystal field should also be an eigenstate of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this occurs for high - spin @xmath146 configurations , except @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "for example , the ground state for a ni@xmath96 ion ( in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ) is @xmath149 .",
    "this is an eigenstate of the crystal field , the coulomb interaction , and @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , no inelastic scattering occurs along all six @xmath145 axes . on the other hand , for co@xmath96",
    ", the ground state is given by latexmath:[$|g\\rangle=\\alpha     + \\beta     where the mixing occurs due the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is not an eigenstate of the octahedral crystal field and the operators @xmath140 , and inelastic scattering in the [ 001 ] direction therefore occurs into the excited multiplet @xmath151 ground state due to band effects and a lowering of the crystal field @xcite give rise to inelastic scattering .",
    "spin - orbit coupling can also remove a nodal direction , but its effect is small except when the spin - orbit coupling lifts a degeneracy .",
    "finally , the conditions for nodal directions above are generally not satified for low- and intermediate - spin ground states .",
    "orbital physics plays an important role in manganites which have been extensively studied for their magnetoresistive behavior @xcite .",
    "lamno@xmath152 is known to have an alternating @xmath153 orbital ordering , and half - filled systems often display the @xmath154 type structure with charge and orbital order occurring in an unconventional zigzag magnetic structure .",
    "however , others have contested this ionic picture stating that the ground state is more complex .",
    "for example , for la@xmath155sr@xmath156mno@xmath157 , it was claimed , based on x - ray magnetic linear dichroism experiments @xcite , that a significant out - of - plane character was mixed in , giving an orbital ordering close to @xmath158 .",
    "we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the angular dependence of nonresonant ixs on the detailed nature of the ground state .",
    "the ground state for mn@xmath159 is given by a @xmath160 configuration .",
    "degenerate @xmath161 orbitals @xmath162 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath163 ( @xmath100 ) are sensitive to distortions leading to lowest states given by @xmath164 , with @xmath165 .",
    "the phases account for the different orientations of the orbitals due to orbital ordering often found in manganites . with nonresonant ixs",
    ", one can make excitations into the empty state @xmath166 by exciting an electron from the @xmath161 ( @xmath167 ) or @xmath168 states ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "for the former , the inelastic intensity summed over both @xmath170 orientations is @xmath171 see also table [ angular ] .",
    "figure [ orbitonee ] shows the angular dependencies for different ground - state orbitals given by @xmath172 , see fig .",
    "[ orbitonee](a ) .",

    "[ orbitonee](b ) . the angular dependence can be rewritten as @xmath175 and can be straightforwardly used to extract the value of @xmath29 .",
    "a typical experiment is comparable to those of larson _ et al .",
    "one fixes the magnitude of the transferred momentum and changes its angle . for example , the intensity when rotating the angle from the @xmath101 $ ] to the @xmath137 $ ] direction depends strikingly on @xmath29 . for @xmath176 , which corresponds to an electron in the @xmath177 orbital ,",
