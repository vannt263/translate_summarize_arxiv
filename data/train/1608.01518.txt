    "the study of the orbital dynamics of small - body populations in the solar system has multiple practical applications ranging from the computation of impact and cratering rates on to planetary bodies ( see e.g. michel & morbidelli 2007 ) to selection of spacecraft accessible targets ( see e.g. adamo et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the particular case of the near - earth objects ( neos ) , the analysis of their present - day orbital architecture , their past orbital evolution , and their future scattering events has made possible to improve steadily our understanding of the dynamical properties of the immediate neighbourhood of our planet .    in general and for a given planetary host ,",
    "the small - body populations subjected to direct gravitational interaction with the host are either primordial or transient .",
    "transient small - body populations consistently dominate , but primordial dynamical groups are known to exist .",
    "primordial dynamical groups in direct gravitational interaction with a planetary host are captured permanently in resonance and they may have formed near their present location . within this context , perhaps the most relevant resonance is the 1:1 mean motion resonance that makes objects go around a central star in almost exactly one planetary orbital period .",
    "these interesting bodies are termed co - orbitals even if their orbits only resemble that of the host planet in terms of orbital period but they are very eccentric and/or inclined ( morais & morbidelli 2002 ) .",
    "frozen in orbital parameter space , primordial co - orbital small bodies are the remnants of the physical and dynamical processes that molded their planetary host and this fact makes them particularly interesting when attempting to reconstruct the conditions reigning at that moment .",
    "well - known examples of these populations are the trojans of jupiter ( see e.g. di sisto , ramos & beaug 2014 ; wong , brown & emery 2014 ) , mars ( see e.g. marzari et al .",
    "2002 ; connors et al . 2005 ; scholl , marzari & tricarico 2005 ; uk , christou & hamilton 2015 ) or neptune ( see e.g. parker 2015 ; gerdes et al .",
    "in addition to primordial co - orbitals , objects from the planet - crossing small - body populations can undergo temporary co - orbital capture giving rise to transient co - orbital populations . in a multi - planet environment , the orbital evolution of transient co - orbitals ( including capture and ejection ) is mostly controlled by secular resonances induced by planets other than the host .",
    "small bodies are classified dynamically ( for instance as atens , apollos , centaurs , etc ) based on their present - day orbital solutions .",
    "the case of co - orbitals , both primordial and transient , is however more complicated . having a particular set of orbital elements at present time is not enough to claim a co - orbital relationship with a host ; a representative set of statistically compatible orbits must be integrated forward and backwards in time to show that the dynamical evolution of the object over a reasonable amount of time is also consistent with being locked in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with the host . therefore , co - orbital objects are identified indirectly after investigating numerically their orbital evolution .",
    "minor bodies are classified as co - orbitals of a given host after studying the behaviour of a critical angle .",
    "the variable of interest here is the relative mean longitude , @xmath9 , or difference between the mean longitude of the object and that of its host . in celestial mechanics ,",
    "the mean longitude of an object planet or minor body is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean anomaly , @xmath12 is the longitude of the ascending node , and @xmath13 is the argument of perihelion ( see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the relative mean longitude of a non - resonant object with respect to a second body circulates ; i.e. @xmath14 with all the values being equally probable . however , if an object is locked in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with a host , the critical or resonant angle @xmath9 librates or oscillates around a certain , well - defined value . although the critical value is a function of the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the objects involved ( namouni , christou & murray 1999 ; namouni & murray 2000 ) , 0 , @xmath1560or 180are often cited in the literature as the signposts of co - orbital behaviour ( see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 )",
    "there are three elementary or primary co - orbital configurations : quasi - satellite or retrograde satellite , trojan or tadpole , and horseshoe .",
    "however , in a multi - planet environment , the co - orbital dynamics experienced by an object may show a surprisingly high level of complexity as compound states ( see e.g. morais & morbidelli 2002 ) and recurrent transitions between the three elementary co - orbital dynamical states ( namouni et al .",
    "1999 ; namouni & murray 2000 ) are feasible .",
    "out of the three primary co - orbital configurations , the quasi - satellite dynamical state is the rarest and it is characterized by the libration of @xmath9 about 0@xmath16 .",
    "this value of the resonant angle is independent from the nature of the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the objects involved .",
    "although a bona fide quasi - satellite appears to travel around its host when its motion is viewed in a frame of reference rotating with the host ( see e.g. fig . [ qs ] ) , the object is not gravitationally bound to it and describes complex , drifting loops as observed from the host ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ qsradec ] ) .",
    "the term ` quasi - satellite ' was brought before and popularized among the astronomical community by mikkola & innanen ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , the associated concept had been first studied by jackson ( 1913 ) and its energy balance was initially explored by hnon ( 1969 ) , who coined the term ` retrograde satellites ' to refer to them , although this term is seldom used nowadays .",
    "the details of this interesting co - orbital configuration were further studied by szebehely ( 1967 ) , broucke ( 1968 ) , benest ( 1976 , 1977 ) , dermott & murray ( 1981 ) , kogan ( 1989 ) and lidov & vashkovyak ( 1993 , 1994a , b ) ; the stability of the quasi - satellite dynamical state has been studied by mikkola et al .",

    "most of the results presented in the works cited have been obtained within the simplified framework of the restricted elliptic three - body problem . however , the interest in this orbital configuration is far from strictly theoretical .",
    "quasi - satellite configurations may have played a role in the origin of the earth ",
    "moon system ( kortenkamp & hartmann 2016 ) ; they have also been found numerically ( de la fuente marcos , de la fuente marcos & aarseth 2016 ) within the context of the planet nine hypothesis ( batygin & brown 2016 ) .    although the existence of quasi - satellites was predicted over a century ago , the first minor body to be confirmed to follow a quasi - satellite trajectory , in this case with respect to venus , was 2002  ve@xmath17 in 2004 ( mikkola et al .",

    ", objects in this co - orbital configuration have been found pursuing ceres and vesta ( christou 2000b ; christou & wiegert 2012 ) .",
    "jupiter appears to host the largest known population of quasi - satellites in the solar system with at least six , including asteroids and comets ( kinoshita & nakai 2007 ; wajer & krlikowska 2012 ) .",
    "saturn ( gallardo 2006 ) and neptune ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012c ) have one quasi - satellite each .",
    "even dwarf planet pluto has at least one ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012b , but see porter et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "therefore , our planet may come in second place regarding number of quasi - satellite companions .",
    "extensive numerical simulations show that the four known earth quasi - satellites 164207 , 277810 , 2013  lx@xmath6 and 2014  ol@xmath7 are of transient nature ( see the review in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 , 2016c ) .",
    "no candidates to being primordial quasi - satellites have been identified yet , but kortenkamp ( 2005 ) has argued that early in the history of the solar system , 5 to 20 per cent of planetesimals scattered by any given planet may have become quasi - satellites . at present time , large amounts of interplanetary dust particles are also being temporarily trapped in earth s quasi - satellite resonance ( kortenkamp 2013 ) .",
    "although a quasi - satellite is not a true satellite , it may become one .",
    "co - orbitals that follow orbits similar to that of the host body experience slow encounters with it . in the particular case of planetary hosts and during a slow encounter , the relative velocity between co - orbital and planet can be so slow that the planetocentric energy may become negative . under these circumstances",
    ", the object can experience a temporary satellite capture in strict sense .",
    "this theoretical possibility was confirmed dramatically after careful analysis of the orbital evolution of 2006  rh@xmath18 , a transient co - orbital that stayed as natural satellite of our planet for about a year starting in 2006 june ( kwiatkowski et al .",
    "2009 ; granvik , vaubaillon & jedicke 2012 ) .",
    "such transient natural satellites are often referred to in the literature as mini - moons ( granvik et al . 2012 ; bolin et al . 2014 ) and they may in some cases collide with the planetary host ( clark et al .",
    "2016 ) as it happened in july 1994 with comet d / shoemaker - levy 9 and jupiter ( carusi , marsden & valsecchi 1994 ; benner & mckinnon 1995 ; kary & dones 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , capture of quasi - satellites could lead to the production of irregular satellites of the jovian planets ( see e.g. jewitt & haghighipour 2007 ) .    on a more practical side ,",
    "earth co - orbitals quasi - satellites included are also interesting targets for future sample return missions and other outer space activities ( see e.g. lewis 1996 ; stacey & connors 2009 ; elvis 2012 , 2014 ; garca yrnoz , sanchez & mcinnes 2013 ; harris & drube 2014 ) .",
    "a number of these neos are relatively easy to access from the earth because they have both short perigee distances and low orbital inclinations .",
    "consistently , they have been made part of the near - earth object human space flight accessible targets study ( nhats ) list ( abell et  al .",
    "2012a , b ) . in general ,",
    "quasi - satellites do not experience flybys with our planet as close as those observed for other co - orbital types but , in terms of average distance from our planet ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ qsradecperi ] ) , some of them e.g .",
    "164207 tend to remain accessible for comparatively lengthy periods of time , making the scheduling of a putative sample return mission easier .",
    "although our planet is perhaps only second to jupiter regarding number of quasi - satellites , horseshoe librators not quasi - satellites dominate the known population of earth co - orbitals ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2016a , b ) .",
    "these objects follow horseshoe orbits ( see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) such as the value of @xmath9 oscillates about 180with an amplitude wider than 180 , often enclosing @xmath19 . a number of earth co - orbitals that at present pursue horseshoe paths 2001",
    "go@xmath0 , 2002  aa@xmath1 , 2003  yn@xmath2 and 2015  so@xmath0 experience repeated transitions to and from the quasi - satellite dynamical state ( brasser et al .",

    "this orbital behaviour was first predicted theoretically by namouni ( 1999 ) .",
    "here , we show that the recently discovered minor body ( 469219 ) 2016  ho@xmath3 is a quasi - satellite of the earth that also switches repeatedly between the quasi - satellite and horseshoe configurations .",
    "the object was originally selected as a co - orbital candidate because of its small relative semimajor axis , @xmath20 0.0005 au ; extensive @xmath8-body calculations confirm its current earth quasi - satellite dynamical status .",

    "our results are discussed in section 6 .",
    "section 7 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the identification of co - orbital objects is not based on the present - day values of their orbital parameters alone , but on the statistical analysis of the results of large sets of numerical integrations .",

    "these numerical integrations have been carried out using the hermite scheme ( makino 1991 ; aarseth 2003 ) .",

    "( 2011 ) among others . at the end of the simulations , the relative errors in the total energy are @xmath21 and those in the total angular momentum are several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "our integrations have two main ingredients : initial conditions and physical model .",
    "in the case of a nominal orbit , our initial conditions ( positions and velocities in the barycentre of the solar system ) have been provided directly by the jpl horizons system ( giorgini et al .",
    "1996 ; giorgini & yeomans 1999 ; giorgini , chodas & yeomans 2001 ) .",
    "they are relative to the jd tdb ( julian date , barycentric dynamical time ) epoch 2457600.5 ( 2016-july-31.0 ) , which is the @xmath22 = 0 instant in the figures .",
    "these initial conditions , for both planets and minor bodies , are based on the de405 planetary orbital ephemerides ( standish 1998 ) .",
    "the initial conditions for all the control orbits of 469219 are based on the available orbital solution ( see section 3.5 for details ) .",
    "the physical model includes the perturbations from the eight major planets , the moon , the barycentre of the pluto - charon system , and the three largest asteroids .",
    "an example of a typical input file with details can be found in the appendix ( table 9 ) of de la fuente marcos , de la fuente marcos & aarseth ( 2015 ) .",
    "our physical model does not include non - gravitational forces , relativistic or oblateness terms in the integrated equations of motion .",
    "we have neglected the effect of the yarkovsky and yarkovsky ",
    "okeefe  radzievskii",
    " paddack ( yorp ) effects ( see e.g. bottke et al .",
    "2006 ) , but ignoring these effects has no relevant impact on the evaluation of the present - day dynamical status of 469219 .",
    "not including these non - gravitational forces in the calculations may affect both the reconstruction of the dynamical past of this object and any predictions made regarding its future orbital evolution .",
    "however , accurate modelling of the yarkovsky force requires relatively precise knowledge of the physical properties such as rotation rate , albedo , bulk density , surface conductivity or emissivity of the objects under study , which is not the case here ( see section 3.1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the effects derived from these forces may be unimportant when objects are tumbling or in chaotic rotation , and neos this small often are .",
    "effects resulting from the theory of general relativity are insignificant for objects following orbits like that of 469219 ( see e.g. benitez & gallardo 2008 ) .",
    "the role of the oblateness of the earth can be neglected for cases like the one studied here see the analysis in dmitriev , lupovka & gritsevich ( 2015 ) for the chelyabinsk superbolide .",

    "such dynamical arrangement is particularly sensitive to the numerical values of the physical and orbital parameters of the actors involved .",
    "most dynamical studies focus exclusively on the role of the errors in the available orbital solutions of the various bodies included in the calculations , but jupiter is a major indirect neo perturber ( as it is in the case of 469219 ) and the value of its mass is still in need of some improvement . the value of the mass of jupiter as quoted by the jpl solar system dynamics group , horizons on - line ephemeris system is @xmath31  kg .",

    "such a strong improvement in the precision of jupiter s mass parameter determination will indirectly improve our assessment of the stability of earth co - orbitals .",
    "among known earth co - orbitals , the long - term evolution of ( 469219 ) 2016  ho@xmath3 clearly stands out .",

    ", at least two processes can dislodge large rocks from a weakly bound minor body .",
    "resurfacing events can be triggered when an asteroid encounters our planet during flybys at relatively large planetary distances , in the range 520 planetary radii ( see e.g. keane & matsuyama 2015 ) ; even more likely , fragments can also be released after the spin rate of an asteroid is dramatically altered during a close encounter with our planet ( scheeres et al . 2005 ) , such a sudden change may induce subsequent structural failure that results in large rocky blocks being ejected from the larger , crumbling asteroid ( see e.g. denneau et al .",
    "in the framework of this hypothetical but certainly not impossible scenario , the relatively large fragments released during one of these partial disruption events may remain within the orbital neighbourhood of our planet confined inside a dynamical mesh where resonances interweave in a complex pattern that pervades the entire region ( see section 3 ) .",
    "due to the singular orbital evolution of this small body , it will remain observable from the ground under relatively favourable conditions for many decades to come ( see figs [ qsradec ] , [ qsradecperi ] and [ short ] ) .",
    "its apparent visual magnitude at perigee could be as low as 22  mag or slightly lower in april",
    ". these facts could turn this object into an eventual ` rosetta stone ' whose study could lead to uncovering the true origin of earth s co - orbitals or at least of some of them .",
    "spectroscopic observations during its future close approaches to our planet should be able to confirm a possible genesis in the earth ",
    "moon system as lunar debris or even a physical connection with 2015 so@xmath0 which is already a close dynamical relative , and also discard a putative artificial origin for this object .",
    "such studies may be particularly helpful in improving our understanding of the origins local versus captured of earth s co - orbital asteroid population .",
    "the subject of neos currently engaged in quasi - satellite behaviour with our planet has been revisited in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 , 2016c ) .",
    "the conclusion of this study was that the known quasi - satellites form a very heterogeneous , dynamically speaking , transient group .",
    "this result suggests that they have been temporarily captured from the earth - crossing small - body populations .",
    "if we compare the results obtained here with those in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 , 2016c ) , that conclusion is only confirmed although the orbital evolution of ( 164207 )  2004  gu@xmath4 clearly resembles that of ( 469219 ) 2016  ho@xmath3 , even if their orbital inclinations are somewhat different .",
    "asteroid 469219 is also significantly more stable than 164207 as it remains for a longer period of time inside earth s co - orbital zone .",
    "the quality of the orbital solutions of both objects is comparable , therefore their different level of dynamical stability is a robust , distinctive feature . in principle",
    ", it may appear somewhat surprising being able to find so much orbital diversity among transient earth quasi - satellites however , as pointed out above ( see section 3 ) , the overlapping of a multiplicity of secular resonances makes this region particularly chaotic .",
    "the effect of secular resonances on the dynamics of minor bodies following orbits with @xmath27 smaller than 2  au and relatively low values of @xmath28 was first studied by michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) .",
    "these early results were further extended by michel ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) concluded that minor bodies with @xmath36  au are subjected to the kozai - lidov resonance that , at low inclination , induces orcillation of the argument of perihelion around the values 0or 180 , the second variant of the kozai - lidov mechanism ( see e.g. michel & thomas 1996 ) .",
    "this behaviour has been found for 2009 da@xmath37 ( see section 3.7 ) , but 469219 and several other co - orbitals are not currently affected by the kozai - lidov mechanism .",
    "asteroid 469219 exhibits a number of dynamical features that make it unusual .",
    "in addition , it is not often that an earth co - orbital as small as this one that encounters our planet at relatively large distances sports an orbital determination as precise as the one in table [ elements ] .",
    "this is possible because , in terms of average geocentric distance , it is one of the closest known co - orbitals if not the closest .",
    "earth quasi - satellites have not been the target subject of specific surveys .",
    "for instance , the discovery of 2014  ol@xmath7 ( vaduvescu et al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ) was the by - product of a standard neo survey , euronear ( vaduvescu et al . 2008 ) ; the others also were serendipitous , not planned , findings .",
    "therefore , the identification by chance in less than a year of two objects moving in similar orbits , 2015  so@xmath0 and 469219 , that also exhibit matching orbital evolution within several thousand years backwards and forward in time , strongly suggests that these two and other yet to be discovered neos may be part of a group of dynamical origin as the ones described in e.g. de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2016d ) .",
    "asteroid 469219 can not be considered part of the group of neos moving in earth - like orbits or arjunas ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013 , 2015a , c ) because its eccentricity is perhaps too high",
    ". however , it shares a number of dynamical features with them , in particular those derived from switching between co - orbital states .",
    "our calculations show that 469219 is unlikely to collide with our planet .",
    "its orbital properties are such that it always remains at a safe distance from the earth but still close enough to make it an attractive target for future in situ study .",
    "its relative velocity at encounter remains in the range @xmath383 to 5 km s@xmath39 for approaches in the near future .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the orbital evolution of the recently discovered neo ( 469219 ) 2016  ho@xmath3 .",
    "this study has been performed using @xmath8-body simulations .",
    "in addition , a number of dynamical issues regarding the stability of earth s co - orbital asteroid population have been re - examined .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "a.   asteroid 469219 is an earth co - orbital , the fifth known quasi - satellite of our planet and the smallest .",
    "its present quasi - satellite dynamical state started nearly 100 yr ago and it will end in about 300 yr from now , transitioning to a horseshoe state .",
    "it is the closest known earth quasi - satellite , in terms of average distance from our planet .",
    "b.   extensive @xmath8-body simulations show that it can be counted among the most stable known earth co - orbitals , with a lyapunov time close to 7500 yr",
    ". this object may stay within earth s co - orbital zone for a time interval well in excess of 1 myr . c.   like a few other known earth co - orbitals , 469219 experiences repeated transitions between the quasi - satellite and horseshoe dynamical states .",
    "jupiter plays a major role in the operation of the dynamical mechanism responsible for these transitions .",
    "d.   although a few other neos move in orbits similar to that of 469219 , only one of them 2015 so@xmath0 exhibits a dynamical evolution that closely resembles that of the object discussed here .",
    "e.   our orbital analysis singles out 469219 as a very suitable candidate for spectroscopic studies as it will remain well positioned with respect to our planet for many decades .",
    "its location within the neo orbital parameter space makes it also an attractive target for future in situ study .",
    "f.   exploratory calculations show that the assessment of the stability of earth co - orbitals following paths similar to those of 2015 so@xmath0 and 469219 depends on the uncertainty in the value of the mass of jupiter . in general , an improved determination of the value of the jovian mass will translate into a more robust statistical evaluation of the stability of earth co - orbitals .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her constructive and particularly helpful report , s.  j. aarseth for providing the code used in this research and for his helpful comments on the effect of the uncertainties in the masses of the giant planets on the results of @xmath8-body simulations and on earlier versions of this work , r. a. jacobson for providing the jup310 ephemeris and for valuable comments on the uncertainty in the value of the jovian mass , and s. deen for finding precovery images of ( 469219 ) 2016  ho@xmath3 that improved the orbital solution of this object significantly and for additional comments . in preparation of this paper",
