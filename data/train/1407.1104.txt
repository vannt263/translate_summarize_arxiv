    "extracting work from a system ( reservoir ) has attracted a widespread research interest recently @xcite .",
    "the original jarzynski equality @xcite culminating in the recent developments states that , for a finite time nonequilibrium process , @xmath0 , this means that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the work exerted on the system , and @xmath3 is the equilibrium free energy difference between the initial and final states .",
    "more recently , an information - theoretic concept  relative entropy has been introduced @xcite , and the original jarzynski equality is then extended to a new context where the measurement process and the information contribution from the measurement have been incorporated to produce a generalized jarzynski equality @xmath4 , where the quantity @xmath5 is the obtained information measured by the relative entropy . then the generalized second law is written as @xcite , @xmath6    from eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , it becomes clear that , when the parameters are chosen appropriately , the thermal equilibrium states of the system remain the same at the initial and final times , hence the applied work can be negative due to the presence of the information contribution .",
    "physically , it implies that one can extract work from the reservoir .",
    "recently several models have been studied including szilard machine @xcite where the work can be extracted from the thermal reservoir by employing the information of the particle s position in the box , and the brownian particle model @xcite where one can show that the brownian particle can be driven by using the information of the measurement outcomes of the particle s position @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a more sophisticated brownian motion model with variable potential s stiffness and potential center together with a measurement process has been studied to show how the maximum work can be extracted from the reservoir @xcite .",
    "other interesting developments that are devoted to energy and information extraction include the transporting particles devices through writing the information on the bit tape @xcite , the electron transport @xcite where one electronic state of a quantum dot is used as a detector , which only affects the entropy production of the probed conventional single electron transistor ( set ) etc . @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the work extracting from the system consisting of the magnetic field coupled brownian particles by incorporating the obtained information from measurement processes based on a model for the dynamics of the plasma diffusion @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the work and the measurement relation and explore the work extraction in four interesting setups .",
    "first , we consider the measurement operation and the potential change operation in the same direction .",
    "then , we consider a different setup where the two operations are executed in different directions .",
    "next , we consider the work extraction when two independent measurements are considered . finally , we discuss the extracted work when the potential change operations are made in both two directions , and the measurement takes place only on one direction .",
    "we find that , for all four setups , when the measurement effects are taken into account , the generalized second law is valid even when the measurement operation and the changing potential operation are spatially separated .",
    "it is interesting to note that more work can be extracted when two independent measurements are performed .",
    "in addition , we have studied the magnetic field effect on the thermodynamics of this coupled particles system .",

    "it is seen that in this weak - coupling limit the potential change operation can not extract the work from the reservoir . when the magnetic field coupling strength is relatively large , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 direction dynamics are coupled , and one can extract work from the reservoir ( @xmath121 ) . however , it is worthwhile to note that , if the magnetic field becomes too strong ( exceeding a threshhold ) , the applied work approaches zero .",
