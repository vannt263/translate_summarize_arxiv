    "in the 1990s a number of works were published , in which the carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundances were derived for local early b - type stars on the main sequence ( ms ) ( kilian 1992 ; gies & lambert 1992 ; cunha & lambert 1994 ; daflon et al .",
    "it was shown that these b stars were deficient in c , n and o typically by 0.20.4 dex with respect to the published abundances for the sun .",
    "one might ask whether this deficiency reflects a real difference in the metal abundances between the b - type ms stars and the sun .",
    "( it should be remembered that it is accepted in astrophysics to denote by metals all chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ) .",
    "if so , then , following nissen ( 1993 ) , it should be recognized that the metallicity of the b stars is lower by about a factor of two than the metallicity of the sun , i.e. , the metal mean mass fraction must be z = 0.01 for them instead of the usually accepted solar value z = 0.02 .",
    "an assumption arose that the sun formed out of material enriched by metals ( see , e.g. , daflon et al .",
    "moreover , a hypothesis appeared that other f  g main sequence stars with planet systems are also more metal rich than similar stars without planets ( gonzalez 1997 , 2003 ) .",
    "there was a different viewpoint , namely that the initial c , n and o abundances in the sun and in the nearby b stars were really the same , but the observed deficiency in the b stars results from either the effect of gravitational - radiative separation of elements in the stellar atmosphere or systematic errors in the abundance analysis of the b stars .",
    "a partial solution of the problem came unexpectedly from the recent c , n and o abundance determinations for the sun on the basis of a three - dimensional time - dependent hydrodynamical model solar atmosphere ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; asplund 2002 ; asplund et al .",
    "it was shown that in this more realistic 3d case the solar c , n and o abundances decrease markedly as compared with the standard 1d case ( see , e.g. , holweger 2001 ) .",
    "so , the discrepancy between the b stars and the sun decreases , too .",
    "carbon , nitrogen and oxygen participate in the h - burning cno - cycle that is a main source of energy of b - type ms stars .",
    "their abundances in stellar interiors change significantly during the ms phase .",
    "there are empirical data on mixing between the interiors and surface layers of early b stars ( see , e.g. , lyubimkov 1996 , 1998 ; maeder & meynet 2000 ) .",
    "mixing will reduce the surface c abundance and increase the surface n abundance as material from layers exposed to the n - cycle is brought to the surface . mixing to deeper depths",
    "will bring products of the on - cycles to the surface resulting in a reduction of the surface o abundance and further increase of the n abundance .",
    "in fact , our analysis of the helium abundance in early b stars led to the conclusion that the observed he enrichment during the ms phase can be explained by rotation with velocities @xmath6 kms@xmath7(lyubimkov et al .",
    "when adopting , for instance , @xmath8 kms@xmath7 , one may find from heger & langer s ( 2000 ) computations that for a 15 mo star the surface c , n and o abundances change by -1.2 , + 0.9 and -0.4 dex , respectively .",
    "therefore , use of c , n and o as indicators of metallicity of early b stars is not strictly correct .    in the case of cool stars",
    ", iron is usually used as an indicator of metallicity . on the one hand , this element does not participate in thermonuclear reactions during early evolutionary phases , and , therefore , its abundance corresponds to the initial metallicity of a star . on the other hand",
    ", it gives a lot of spectral lines , which allow its abundance to be derived with high accuracy .",
    "the metallicity [ @xmath9 is determined then as the difference between the fe abundances of the star and the sun , i.e.    @xmath10 = \\log \\varepsilon_*({\\rm fe } ) - \\log \\varepsilon_{\\sun}({\\rm fe}),\\ ] ]    where the abundance @xmath11 corresponds to the standard logarithmic scale with the hydrogen abundance @xmath12 . unfortunately , in spectra of early b stars the iron lines are weak .",
    "one of the strongest lines in spectra of early and medium b stars is the mgii  4481.2   line .",
    "magnesium is quite suitable as an indicator of metallicity , because it does not change its abundance during the ms evolutionary phase .",
    "even its participation in the mgal - cycle leads to a negligible decrease of the abundance , by about 0.020.03 dex ( daflon et al .",
    "moreover , for magnesium , unlike c , n and o , the precise solar abundance is known .",
    "in fact , according to holweger ( 2001 ) , its abundance derived from photospheric lines is @xmath13 .",
    "this spectroscopic value is very close to the meteoritic abundance @xmath14 .",
    "averaging these two abundances , lodders ( 2003 ) recommends the value @xmath15 as the solar magnesium abundance ( meteoritic refers to the ci - type chondrites ) .",
    "we shall use the latter value .",
    "the metallicity of stars will be determined from formula    @xmath16 = \\log \\varepsilon_*({\\rm mg } ) -",
    "\\log \\varepsilon_{\\sun}({\\rm mg}).\\ ] ]    it should be noted that lodders presents also the proto - sun magnesium abundance @xmath17 .",
    "this value differs slightly from the above - mentioned photospheric value because heavy - element fractionation in the sun has altered original abundances .    at present",
    "we continue our study of large sample of early and medium b stars .",
    "our general goal was to provide new comprehensive observations of the stars and to determine and analyse the abundances of cno - cycle elements , namely helium , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "a series of papers is being published .",
    "first , we obtained high - resolution spectra of more than 100 stars at two observatories , namely the mcdonald observatory of the university of texas and the crimean astrophysical observatory ( ukraine ) ; equivalent widths of 2 hydrogen lines and 11 helium lines were measured ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "2000 , hereinafter paper i ) .",
    "second , we determined a number of fundamental parameters of the stars including the effective temperature @xmath18 , surface gravity @xmath19 , interstellar extinction @xmath20 , distance @xmath21 , mass @xmath22 , radius @xmath23 , luminosity @xmath24 , age @xmath25 , and relative age @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ms lifetime ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "2002 , paper ii ) .",
    "third , from non - lte analysis of hei  lines we derived the helium abundance @xmath28 , microturbulent parameter @xmath1  and projected rotational velocity @xmath29sin@xmath30  ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "2004 , paper iii ) .",
    "presently , we are analysing cii , nii  and oii  lines ; in particular , the microturbulent parameter @xmath1  is determined from these lines , too .",
    "we present in this paper a new determination of the mg abundances in b stars that is based on our spectra and our atmospheric parameters .",
    "we use the mgii  4481.2   line and for a sample of hot stars a weaker mgii  line at 7877  .",
    "an analysis of the mgii  4481.2   line can be complicated by presence of the neighbouring aliii  4479.9   line . if a star has a rather high rotational velocity @xmath29sin@xmath30 , the two lines form a common blend . in such cases",
    "the computation of synthetic spectra is necessary .",
    "the aliii  4479.9   line intensity depends strongly on @xmath18 . in fig.1",
    "we show as examples the observed spectra in the mgii  4481.2   vicinity for three b stars with the different effective temperatures @xmath18  and low rotational velocities @xmath29sin@xmath30(i.e . with sharp spectral lines ) .",
    "one sees that the aliii  4479.9   line is relatively strong at @xmath18  = 22500 k , but weak both at the high temperature , @xmath18  = 30700 k , and at the low one , @xmath18  = 15800 k.    and low rotational velocities @xmath29sin@xmath30.,width=317 ]    in order to study the dependence on @xmath18  in more detail , we measured the equivalent width @xmath31 of this line for 28 b stars from our list , which have the little rotational velocities ( 5 kms@xmath7@xmath32 @xmath29sin@xmath30  @xmath32 33 kms@xmath7 ) and the effective temperatures @xmath18  @xmath33 15800 k. in fig.2a we present the @xmath31 value as a function of @xmath18 . to guide the eye , we approximated the relation by the fourth - order polynomial ( solid curve in fig.2a ) .",
    "one sees that there is a maximum of the @xmath31 values in the @xmath18  range between 21000 and 24000 k.        in fig.2b we show the dependence on @xmath18  for the ratio of equivalent widths of the aliii  4479.9   and mgii  4481.2 lines .",
    "one sees that in the @xmath18  range from 19000 to 27000 k this ratio is equal to about 2030 per cent ; so , if the lines form a common blend , a contribution of the al line must be taken into account .",
    "we believe that the influence of the al line can be ignored only for b stars with temperatures @xmath18",
    "@xmath34 17000 k.    two stars , namely hr1923 and hr2633 , are outliers in fig.2a ( they are marked in fig.2a ) .",
    "we may not explain this discrepancy by errors in the @xmath31(aliii  4479.9 ) measurements , because the profiles of the al line for these stars are sharp and symmetric and , therefore , measured with confidence .",
    "the explanation can not be connected with errors in @xmath18  too , because they are small , @xmath35 and @xmath36 k respectively .",
    "the star hr2633 is the only b giant in fig.2 , it has @xmath19  = 3.38 , whereas for all other stars @xmath19  @xmath37 3.8 , i.e. , they are dwarfs .",
    "if the aliii  4479.9   line is stronger for b giants than for b dwarfs with the same temperatures @xmath18 , then the elevated @xmath31(aliii  4479.9 ) value for hr2633 becomes understandable .",
    "as far as hr1933 is concerned , it is possible that this star has a somewhat lowered al abundance .",
    "it is interesting that in fig.2b , unlike fig.2a , neither of these stars is an ` outlier ' .",
    "although the empirical relations in fig.2 would in principle allow one to correct for the aliii  contribution to the aliii  - mgii  blend in the spectrum of a rapidly - rotating star , we chose in the interest of controlling the uncertainties affecting the the mg abundance to restrict the selection of stars to those where the aliii  and mgii  lines are clearly resolved .    in paper iii , we determined accurate rotational velocities @xmath29sin@xmath30for 100 normal b stars .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath29sin@xmath30  values of the stars span the range from 5 to 280 kms@xmath7 . in order to separate clearly the mgii  and aliii  lines in question",
    ", we should exclude the stars with high @xmath29sin@xmath30 .",
    "we see from our spectra that for the stars with @xmath29sin@xmath30  @xmath38 100 kms@xmath7  the mgii  line is substantially blended by the aliii  line , especially in the above - mentioned @xmath18range between 19000 and 27000 k. so , we reject stars with such large @xmath29sin@xmath30 .",
    "eventually , we singled out the stars with @xmath29sin@xmath30  @xmath32 54 kms@xmath7  when @xmath18  @xmath37 17000 k ; one relatively cool star ( @xmath18  = 16600 k ) with @xmath29sin@xmath30  = 70 kms@xmath7was added .",
    "it is important to note that in spectra of all these stars the aliii  4479.9   line is distinctly separated from the mgii  4481.2   line , so equivalent widths of the latter are measured with confidence .",
    "a list of selected 52 stars is presented in table 1 .",
    "we give here for each star its hr number , as well as the effective temperature @xmath18  and surface gravity @xmath19  from paper ii .",
    "next the microturbulent parameter @xmath1  is given , which was inferred by us for the most of the stars from nii  and oii  lines .",
    "however , for 16 cool stars these lines are too weak and , therefore , unfit for the @xmath1  determination by the standard method , when an agreement in abundances derived from relatively strong and weak lines should take place .",
    "we present for these stars the @xmath1  values obtained in paper iii from hei  lines ( marked by asterisks in table 1 ) .",
    "the projected rotational velocities @xmath29sin@xmath30  from paper iii are given next in table 1 .",
    "we remark below on the equivalent widths @xmath31(4481 ) and magnesium abundances @xmath2 presented in two last columns .",
    ".parameters of 52 b stars , equivalent width of the mgii  4481  line and the magnesium abundance [ cols=\">,^,^,<,>,^,^ \" , ]     one may see from table 3 that there is a significant difference in @xmath1  for both groups between our and daflon et al.s ( 2003 ) results , while the difference with daflon et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) is markedly smaller .",
    "it is necessary to remember that we have used the @xmath1  values averaged on oii  and nii  lines , so our real mean @xmath1  values are somewhat smaller than in table 3 .",
    "it is important to note once again that we determined @xmath1independently from lines of three chemical elements , namely hei , nii  and oii . moreover , the vt determination from nii  and oiilines was implemented by the standard method , but that from heilines was effected by a quite different method ( paper iii ) .",
    "nevertheless , all three sets of @xmath1  are in rather good agreement .",
    "in particular , for the b stars with @xmath18  @xmath34 25500 k we found that ( i ) individual @xmath1  values range , as a rule , between 0 and 5 kms@xmath7 ; ( ii ) mean @xmath1  values are 1.0 , 0.5 and 2.5 kms@xmath7  for hei , nii  and oii , respectively .",
    "( note that we have not found reasons to prefer @xmath1(nii ) over @xmath1(oii ) , so we used an averaged value @xmath1(nii , oii ) ) .",
    "thus , our results from hei , nii  and oii  lines confirm that our lower @xmath1  scale is preferable to the higher @xmath1scale of daflon et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004a , b ) .",
    "it is important to remember as well that our mean mg abundance 7.59 obtained with the @xmath1(nii , oii ) values from the mgii  4481   line is precisely confirmed from an analysis of the weak mgii  7877   line that is insensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "we implemented trial determinations of @xmath39 with various @xmath1  for some stars from first and second groups .",
    "the changes in @xmath2 depend substantially on the effective temperature @xmath18 ; nevertheless , the final conclusion is clear : the differences in the @xmath1  values explain completely the above - mentioned discrepancies between our and daflon et al.s ( 2003 ) mean magnesium abundance .",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to daflon ( 2004 ) , the lower @xmath1  values can be a result of the cooler effective temperatures @xmath18 . the difference between our and daflon et al.s @xmath18  scales can not be sufficient to cause a marked change in thermal velocities and , hence , a change in @xmath1 .",
    "we believe that the difference in @xmath1  discussed above may be connected with a rough correlation between the observed equivalent widths @xmath31 and excitation potentials @xmath40 : lines with higher @xmath40 tend to show lower @xmath31 on average .",
    "these lines are more sensitive to @xmath18than weaker lines , so their calculated @xmath31 values change more significantly when @xmath18  increases . in this case",
    "one should increase @xmath1  to eliminate a discrepancy in the derived abundances between relatively weak and strong lines .",
    "for more than ten years the c , n , and o abundances have been considered as indicators of the metallicity of early b stars in reference to the sun .",
    "however , it is gradually becoming clear that this choice is not the best one .",
    "on the one hand , there are empirical data that mixing exists in the early b - type ms stars between their interiors and surface layers , so the observed abundances of the cno - cycle elements may be affected by evolutionary alterations . on the other hand , the solar c , n and o abundances were continuously revised and tended to decrease during this period .",
    "unfortunately , it was impossible in these cases to use the accurate meteoritic abundances , because c , n and o are incompletely condensed in meteorites , so their meteoritic abundances are significantly lower than the solar ones .",
    "magnesium , unlike c , n and o , does not have such demerits .",
    "first , this chemical element should not alter markedly its abundance in b stars during the ms phase .",
    "second , its solar abundance is known now very precisely from spectroscopic and meteoritic data . displaying the rather strong mgii  4481.2   line in spectra of early and medium b stars ,",
    "this element is appropriate as a reliable indicator of their metallicity .    using the high - resolution spectra of 52 b stars we effected a non - lte analysis of the mgii  4481.2   line and determined the magnesium abundance .",
    "we studied the role of the neighbouring aliii4479.9   line and selected stars with rather low rotational velocities @xmath29sin@xmath30  and , therefore , with the mgii  4481.2   line well resolved from the aliii  4479.9   line .",
    "we found for 52 stars the mean abundance @xmath41 .",
    "the effect of uncertainties in the microturbulent parameter @xmath1  on @xmath2 is important , especially for coolest programme stars .",
    "for 16 such stars the @xmath1values were derived from hei  lines , but not from nii  and oiilines as for other stars .",
    "being close to zero these @xmath1(hei ) values are less accurate than the @xmath1(nii , oii ) values .",
    "when excluding these 16 stars , we obtained the mean abundance @xmath42 for the remaining 36 stars .",
    "this abundance is precisely confirmed from an analysis of the weak mgii  7877   line for several hot b stars .",
    "this is our recommended mg abundance for the b - type ms stars in the solar neighbourhood ( with @xmath43 800 pc ) . comparing the latter value with the solar magnesium abundance @xmath44",
    ", one may conclude that the metallicity of the stars is very close to the solar one .",
    "our mean mg abundance in b stars , as well as the position of the maximum in fig.6 , @xmath45 , is also very close to the proto - sun magnesium abundance @xmath46 .",
    "we discussed the preceding determinations of the mg abundance in b stars by daflon et al .",
    "their @xmath39 values are somewhat lower than ours .",
    "we showed that this difference in @xmath39 is explained by differences in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , our results show that the sun is not measurably enriched in metals as compared with the neighbouring young stars .",
