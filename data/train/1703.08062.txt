    "distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs ) are typically applied to enhance@xcite the reflectance ( @xmath5 ) , but the opposite result  a very low @xmath5  can be also designed and obtained with the use of dbrs@xcite .",
    "such antireflection ( ar ) stacks are particularly useful in resonant optical spectroscopy , where the reflected laser light dominates the investigated signal substantially .",
    "in particular , using four - wave mixing ( fwm ) for probing the coherence of single quantum dots ( qds ) , necessitates efficient injection of the optical excitation into the hetero - structure , so as to reach the field amplitude at the qd location sufficient to induce its fwm .",
    "this condition has been achieved by employing ar planar samples@xcite and , more recently , by suitably designed nanophotonic devices@xcite . here , we realize half - cavity ar planar structures and employ them to investigate fwm of individual cdte qds . as the same structure contains qds with incorporated single mn@xmath1 ions , the appealing prospect of our work is to reveal the exciton s coherence coupled with a magnetic dopant via @xmath2,@xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction .",
    "there are two basic approaches to ar structures on the top of high refractive index ( @xmath6 ) semiconductors .",
    "firstly , one can deposit a single layer with a lower refractive index equal to @xmath7 and thickness of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the targeted wavelength for the lowest reflectance .",
    "while this method offers a broad ar spectral range , its implementation is conditioned by the availability of materials with a required value of @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , one can use symmetric microcavities composed of two dbrs with the nominally the same @xmath5 .",
    "the cavity mode exhibits a pronounced dip in the @xmath5 spectrum , which should be accurately fitted to the wavelength of interest . in this work",
    ", we implement the ar strategy based on a cavity system . in order to maximize the spectral width of the cavity resonance , we have designed and grown a low q - factor structure ( @xmath10 ) : a half - cavity is formed by four bottom bragg pairs and the spacer containing the qd layer , also acting as a semiconductor / air interface at the top .",
    "the sample was grown using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) model svt associates .",
    "our molecular sources were standard knudsen cells loaded with commercially available materials : zn , cd , and te with 7  n purity ; mg and mn with 6  n purity .",
    "chamber pressure was at level of about @xmath11  torr .",
    "the growth was assisted by _ in - situ _ optical reflectance ( model filmetrics f-30 ) with a white light incident beam perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "the system is equipped with a heated optical viewport , so that it was possible to perform spectroscopic measurement during a long growth sequence , while avoiding material deposition on the window . for the sample described in this work",
    ", we monitored @xmath5 versus time at @xmath12 nm , as shown in fig.[fig : structure](a ) . in our method , this choice defined the resonant wavelength of the cavity for a given spot of the sample ( the substrate was not rotated during the growth ) .",
    "however , other zones of the sample exhibit either thinner layers with cavity resonance at shorter wavelength or thicker layers with resonance at longer wavelength .     the growth was performed at constant temperature t = 345@xmath13 c , on a 2-inch gaas : si substrate oriented ( 100 ) with 2@xmath14 off .",
    "we started by depositing a 3@xmath15 m thick cdte buffer .",
    "since cdte is absorbing at @xmath16 nm , the corresponding oscillations of @xmath5 were rapidly suppressed and a characteristic @xmath17 was measured before time @xmath18s . as depicted in fig.[fig : structure](b ) , we next grew a cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te buffer lattice matched to subsequent dbr layers . due to the presence of mg and zn , such buffer exhibits a slightly lower refractive index than cdte and @xmath22mev larger energy gap than cdte . therefore , cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te buffer is transparent for @xmath23 nm , generating interferences in the @xmath24 trace ( time between 10400s and 13100s in fig.[fig : structure]a ) during the growth of this material .",
    "observation of @xmath24 interferences allowed us to determine growth rate v = 1.1 @xmath25m / h .",
    "next , when @xmath24 reached a local maximum , we started the growth of lattice matched dbrs composed of cd@xmath26zn@xmath27mg@xmath28te ( low @xmath6 layer ) and cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te ( high @xmath6 layer)@xcite .",
    "adjacent layers with various composition of mg were obtained using a pair of mg sources , such that either one or two sources were opened at a time . an exact time - point for growing dbrs",
    "was not predefined in the programmed sequence . instead , it was adjusted manually by closing one of the mg shutters , as soon as the minimum of @xmath5 was reached , while keeping opened both mg shutters when the maximum of @xmath5 was attained ( see fig.[fig : structure](a ) ) . as expected , during the initial stage of a dbr growth , after each pair , the contrast between the maximum and minimum value of @xmath5 was increasing .",
    "interestingly , @xmath5 reached the minimum value below 1@xmath29 already after depositing the fourth dbr pair .",
    "since this is what required for an efficient ar structure and further dbr growth would only increase reflectance , we completed the growth of dbrs already after four pairs and we completed @xmath30 cavity composed of the high @xmath6 material cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te , enclosing cdte : mn qds in the middle .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : structure](a ) , fabricating thickness equal to @xmath31 or @xmath32 of high index material does not affect @xmath5 at @xmath23 nm .",
    "our half - cavity structure is formed and terminated by the semiconductor / air interface on the top .",
    "qds are formed out of about 1 nm ( 3 monolayers ) thick cdte : mn layer grown at the same conditions as cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te and the remaining top part of the sample .",
    "basing on giant zeeman effect@xcite measured for thicker cdte : mn layers grown in similar conditions , expected concentration of mn in our cdte : mn layer is about @xmath33 . as a matter of fact",
    ", this layer forms a thin quantum well exhibiting interface fluctuations , leading to formation of qds .",
    "the growth of similar qds , but in cd@xmath34mg@xmath35te barriers , was previously reported@xcite . here",
    ", we used even lower barriers and consequently we shifted the qd emission energy to spectral region where the absorption of ( cd , zn , mg)te is low enough to realize microcavities .",
    "microscopy image of the most important parts of studied structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tem ] .",
    "dbr layers , seen as alternating bright and dark layers , are well resolved .",
    "also , the qd layer is resolved in the middle of the cavity , it is seen as a thin trace in the magnified part of the cavity .",

    "pl was excited nonresonantly at 532 nm using cw power of about 1@xmath25w , well below the qd saturation .",
    "the reflectance was measured using a white ( halogen ) lamp .",
    "k. pl shows a multitude of sharp lines corresponding to excitonic transitions in individual qds .",
    "qds are in resonance with cavity mode observed in reflectance .",

    "both clusters are sixfold split due to @xmath2,@xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction between individual mn@xmath1 ion and carriers confined in a qd . ]",
    "the pl reveals a signal from a thin cdte layer at 665 nm and sharp lines of individual cdte qds in range 670 - 700 nm . in our sample ,",
    "cdte qds are placed in cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te barrier , which is also visible as a weak peak close to 650 nm in the pl spectrum and as a spectral wiggle in @xmath38 between 635 and 650 nm .",
    "we therefore estimate the confinement energy of around 50mev for the excitons localized in qd - like states .",
    "reflectance spectrum at the investigated area of the wafer shows also a broad ( about 40 nm wide ) and deep ( below 3@xmath29 of reflectance ) cavity mode centered at 670 nm , in resonance with the emission of qds . the obtained broad and deep cavity mode , mimics an ar coating , but also provides a local excitation intensity enhancement @xmath39 for the spectral and spatial location of qds . during the growth @xmath5",
    "was minimized for 730 nm ( fig.[fig : structure](a ) ) for the center of the sample , but as shown in fig [ fig : pl - ref](b ) , owing to the thickness gradients , other parts of the wafer display a spectrally shifted cavity mode .",
    "this permits to adjust low @xmath5 for the desired spectral range by varying the position on the sample .",
    "the sample offers a possibility to investigate and control an exciton coherence coupled , via @xmath2,@xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction , with an individual spin of a magnetic dopant@xcite .",
    "this is possible thanks to mn @xmath40-doping introduced within the cdte qd layer . via micro - photoluminescence spectroscopy",
    "we can recognize qds containing mn ions , and in particular distinguish those incorporating exactly one such dopant . to be more specific ,",
    "qds without magnetic ions exhibit sharp lines ( typical full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) below 0.1 mev ) , originating from the exciton recombination .",
    "qds with more than two magnetic ions exhibit spectrally broader lines ( typically fwhm above 1 mev ) , which significantly shift in a magnetic field.@xcite for qds with exactly two mn ions , each excitonic transition gets split into a manifold of 36 lines , owing to 6 * 6 possible spin states of two mn ions.@xcite finally , a spectral fingerprint of a qd with a single mn ion is very characteristic : exciton transitions display 6-fold splitting , due to @xmath2,@xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction with the mn ion .",
    "the latter exhibits 6 possible spin states , corresponding to spin projection @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 on quantization axis of excitons ( growth axis).@xcite in our sample , majority of qds do not contain mn ions and thus show single lines .",
    "we have not observed qds with two or more mn ions .",
    "however , there is a small fraction ( well below 1% ) of qds , which exhibit the pl pattern characteristic for qds containing exactly one individual mn ion .",
    "a typical example of pl measured at such magnetic qd is shown in fig.[fig : mn ] : the excitonic spectral clusters corresponding to recombination of exciton - to - ground ( gx@xmath37 ) and biexciton - to - exciton states xb@xmath37 do display the characteristic 6-fold splitting @xcite .",
    "spectra are measured as a function of the excitation power . as expected , the biexciton transitions exhibits a much stronger intensity dependence , than the exciton ones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mn ] ) .",
    "observation of a pronounced and spectrally sharp biexciton complex , with a binding energy of around 7mev , indicates that qds forming from fluctuations of thin cdte layer in cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te barrier are in fact well defined zero dimensional objects , which efficiently localize even four carriers ( two holes and two electrons ) .",

    ", we assure that the targeted transition lies at the minimum of the cavity mode . as a result",
    ", we expect the weak fwm field to be enhanced by a factor @xmath58 with respect to bare qds , and thus capable to be induced with a respectively lowered resonant intensity of @xmath59and @xmath60 .",
    "a representative example of the fwm interference at @xmath61ps is presented in fig.[fig : fwm ] , with a signal - to - noise of 10 after 300s integration .",
    "this is comparable with previous fwm measurements on single qds employing ar structures @xcite . in fig.[fig : fwm]c we present fwm amplitude , as a function of @xmath44 amplitude , proportional to its area @xmath62 . with increasing the latter ,",
    "the fwm is expected to yield rabi oscillations @xcite , with the first maximum ( minimum ) at @xmath63 @xmath64 . in our case",
    "however , the accessible range of intensities is not sufficient to attain significant @xmath62 , so as to approach @xmath65 area .",
    "the flopping is not observed and we remain in the @xmath66 driving regime of the fwm .    in the inset of fig.[fig : fwm]d we illustrate the two - pulse sequence performed to infer the coherence dynamics of the same transition ( @xmath49 is set fixed , 1ps prior to @xmath45 ) : @xmath44 induces the coherence , which is converted into the density grating by @xmath45 .",
    "the latter is then self - diffracted into the fwm polarization .",
    "by measuring fwm as a function of @xmath46 one can access the homogeneous broadening @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 denotes dephasing time ) within the inhomogeneously broadened distribution via inferring photon echoes , which in case of a single qd are created by a random spectral wandering @xcite .",
    "the data are fit by the model including both homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the spectral shape @xcite .",
    "the result , shown with a black trace , yields the dephasing time of @xmath69ps and inhomogeneous broadening of @xmath70ev ( fwhm ) .",
    "a large uncertainty of @xmath68 stems from a limited range of the accessible delays , restricted by the time - resolution of the spectrometer - the issue which could be overcome by introducing the delay between @xmath49 and @xmath45.@xcite note the decrease of the fwm during initial several ps , which is due to dephasing with acoustic phonons.@xcite we observe no fwm signal for @xmath71 , which could rise from a two - photon coherence@xcite between the ground state and a two - exciton ( biexciton ) state in a qd .",
    "the missing signal for @xmath72 , indicates that the qd is charged , allowing only for the trion transition @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth to point out an order of magnitude longer @xmath68 , with respect to the previous , and until now sole report available for the cdte - platform @xcite .",
    "our structure represents the third successful approach to the growth of photonic structures with qds containing single mn ions .",
    "the first report has been presented in ref . [ ] , where a three - step process , involving two remote mbe facilities , was established to grow znte / mgte / mgse based microcavities with cdte / znte qds containing single mn ions . in that case , growth interruptions were due to missing molecular sources in growth chambers : the first growth chamber was used to realize dbrs , the second one was employed for the growth of mn - doped qds .",
    "recently , the same material system was used for the growth of mn - doped qds on the top of 10 dbr pairs .",
    "the process was carried out using a single mbe machine , but growth interruptions were anyway required to clean the chamber from the residual se atoms , which incorporated into qds and impaired their optical properties @xcite .    comparing to previous works , here the procedure is significantly simplified , since se is not involved in the growth of our microcavity based on ( cd , zn , mg)te . therefore , the whole process is realized in a single growth chamber , without growth interruptions",
    ". it can be reproduced in any mbe growth chamber devoted to te compounds .",
    "one more important advantage of the present system is that cdte /cd@xmath19zn@xmath20mg@xmath21te",
    "qds with single mn ion presented here could be brought toward the spectral range of al@xmath73o@xmath74:ti tunable femtosecond laser , i.e. above 700 nm .",
    "this could be particularly handy as it eliminates the requirement of using opo sources to perform resonant , ultrafast spectroscopy of this material system .",
    "finally , the design of antireflective photonic structure presented in this work will be necessary for achieving a satisfactory retrieval sensitivity of coherent nonlinear responses of magnetic qds , where the exciton oscillator strength is distributed over a set of spin - assisted transitions .",

    "<S> this work presents epitaxial growth and optical spectroscopy of cdte quantum dots ( qds ) in ( cd , zn , mg)te barriers placed on the top of ( cd , zn , mg)te distributed bragg reflector . </S>",
    "<S> the formed photonic mode in our half - cavity structure permits to enhance the local excitation intensity and extraction efficiency of the qd photoluminescence , while suppressing the reflectance within the spectral range covering the qd transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to perform coherent , nonlinear , resonant spectroscopy of _ individual _ qds . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence dynamics of a charged exciton is measured via four - wave mixing , with the estimated dephasing time @xmath0ps . the same structure contains qds doped with single mn@xmath1 ions , as detected in photoluminescence spectra . </S>",
    "<S> our work therefore paves the way toward investigating and controlling an exciton coherence coupled , via @xmath2,@xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction , with an individual spin of a magnetic dopant . </S>"
