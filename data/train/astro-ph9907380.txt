    "the formation of bound star clusters is a major unsolved problem in observational and theoretical astrophysics .",
    "significant observational ( e.g. lada & lada 1991 ; megeath et al .",
    "1996 ; lada , alves & lada 1996 ; lada , falgarone & evans 1997 ) and theoretical ( e.g. lada , margulis & dearborn 1984 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; klessen , burkert & bate 1998 ) efforts are being directed at solving this problem .",
    "there are serious technical difficulties .",
    "for example , on the observational side , the obscuration of a part of the very young stellar and proto - stellar population and significant uncertainties in pre - main sequence evolution ( e.g. wuchterl & tscharnuter 1999 ) hamper the understanding of the spatial and age distribution within compact star - forming regions . on the theoretical side , the presently next to impossible handling of three - dimensional self - gravitating magneto - hydrodynamics with feedback from forming stars limits detailed understanding of the onset of star - formation in general , and cluster formation in particular .",
    "this paper forms part of a theoretical approach based on purely stellar - dynamical arguments .",
    "these are limited to the phase after the proto - stars and ambient gas decouple dynamically , but allow insights into the evolution of a stellar assemblage after the massive stars rapidly remove the remaining gas .",
    "understanding this phase of the evolution can provide a lead towards the initial conditions that give rise to bound galactic clusters .",
    "stellar - dynamical calculations of binary - rich young compact clusters with aarseth s nbody5 code were presented by kroupa , petr & mccaughrean ( 1999 , hereinafter kpm ) , to study the evolution of the binary population and of the cluster bulk properties .",
    "the results were applied to a comparison with key observables available for the trapezium cluster , and a solution was found in which the trapezium cluster , with a stellar mass of @xmath0 , is expanding rapidly due to the expulsion of about @xmath1 in gas roughly @xmath2  yr ago . however , while that work quantifies the evolution of the binary population and of the cluster within a few  myr , the question remains open as to how unique the expanding solution of the trapezium cluster is .    in this paper the solution space of all possible models of the onc",
    "is studied by invoking stellar - dynamical scaling relations that capture the gross behaviour of star clusters , and by building on the results obtained by kpm .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] summarises the key observables used to constrain the allowed range of models , and in section  [ sec : gen ] the kpm results are generalised and the candidate solution space is identified .",
    "the conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a detailed description of the observational constraints can be found in kpm . here",
    "a brief summary is given .",
    "the key observables used to constrain the stellar - dynamical models by kpm are the central stellar number density , the pre - main - sequence age of the stellar population , the velocity dispersion , and the binary proportion .",
    "based on a high - spatial - resolution direct - imaging near - infrared study , mccaughrean & stauffer ( 1994 ) calculate that 29  systems are within the central spherical volume with a radius of @xmath3  pc .",
    "this corresponds to a central number density @xmath4  stars / pc@xmath5 ( strictly speaking systems / pc@xmath5 , but the maximal factor of  2 error is not critical in this analysis ) . in a near - infrared study covering a field of @xmath6 centred on the trapezium cluster , mccaughrean et al .",
    "( 1996 ) count 700 systems .    from the analysis of the hr - diagram , based on optical photometry and spectroscopy , prosser et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , hillenbrand ( 1997 ) and palla & stahler ( 1999 ) derive a mean age for the whole orion nebula cluster of less than about 1  myr .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion within  0.41  pc of the centre of the trapezium cluster is derived by jones & walker ( 1988 ) , from their relative proper - motion survey using photographic plates , to be @xmath7  km / s .",
    "because the plate - reduction algorithms eliminate any signature due to rotation and/or expansion or contraction , it is unknown from that work and others ( see kpm ) if the trapezium cluster is expanding or contracting .",
    "frink , kroupa & rser ( 1999 ) measure the bulk motions in the onc using new absolute proper motion data , and find some expanding as well as contracting motion .",
    "their result is consistent with the onc currently expanding in an approximately cylindrical molecular cloud potential ( kroupa & frink 1999 ) .",
    "following kpm the velocity dispersion obtained from the more precise relative proper motions is used in the present analysis .",
    "high - resolution imaging using a variety of techniques has shown that the binary proportion within about 0.3  pc of the centre of the trapezium cluster is significantly below that seen in taurus ",
    "auriga , but consistent with the galactic field value ( prosser et al .",
    "1994 ; petr 1998 ; petr et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this may be the result of disruption through encounters in the cluster ( kpm ) .",
    "the trapezium cluster contains virtually no gas ( wilson et al .",
    "1997 ) , and a large part of the onc population is optically visible ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , so that purely stellar - dynamical calculations can be applied .    there is little evidence for sub - structure in the onc ( bate , clarke & mccaughrean 1998 ) .",
    "details are found in kpm .",
    "the kpm models contain @xmath8  stars ( cluster mass @xmath9 ) , with a galactic - field imf with stellar masses in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the stars are paired at random to form a primordial binary proportion of unity , @xmath12 with a period distribution as seen in taurus ",
    "auriga , and @xmath13 with a period distribution as in the galactic field . here ,",
    "the total ( counting all separations ) binary proportion is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number of binary and single - star systems , respectively . stellar evolution is not treated , and the dynamical evolution is followed for 5  myr only .",
    "six different models are constructed to cover a range of possible cases , each having initially a plummer density profile with half - mass radius @xmath17 :    * virial equilibrium models with primordial @xmath12 ( model  a1 ) and @xmath13 ( model  a2 ) . these have initially @xmath18  pc , @xmath19  myr ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tcr ] ) and @xmath20  myr ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tr ] ) . -1 mm * expanding clusters assuming a star formation efficiency @xmath21 and instantaneous loss of a gas mass @xmath22 at the start of the computation , with binary proportions @xmath23 ( model  b1 ) and  0.6 ( model  b2 ) .",
    "these models have @xmath18  pc and an initial velocity dispersion that is @xmath24 larger than the virial equilibrium value without the gas .",
    "-1 mm * clusters that collapse with an initial velocity dispersion that is a factor  0.14 times smaller than the virial equilibrium value , with initially @xmath25  pc ( model  c1 ) and  0.8  pc ( model  c2 ) .",
    "these have @xmath12 .",
    "three renditions of each model yield averages of the relevant observables .",
    "the choice for @xmath26 is based on the observed number of systems in the trapezium cluster .",
    "the initial central density ( @xmath27 stars / pc@xmath5 ) of the virial equilibrium and expanding models is larger than the presently observed value ( @xmath28 stars / pc@xmath5 ) , because a reduction of the central density with time is anticipated without knowing the detailed evolution in advance , since no such compact and binary - rich clusters had ever been evolved until then . for the collapsing models ,",
    "the initial possible configuration is unknown , since @xmath26-body collapse calculations of an initially centrally concentrated density profile and with a large proportion of realistic binary systems had never been done before .",
    "the values @xmath25 and  0.8  pc are thus first tries .",
    "the mean stellar mass is @xmath29 .",
    "it is used throughout this paper : @xmath30 .",
    "before constraining the solution space using dynamical arguments , a pre - selection can be made immediately , by noting that the lower limit on @xmath26 is 700  stars , since this many systems have been counted in the trapezium cluster ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "it is known that the binary fraction is high ( about 5060  per cent ) , so @xmath26 is likely to be closer to 1200 .",
    "however , since some loss of stars is expected through dynamical ejection , and in general location at larger radii than the survey limit , @xmath8 is deemed more appropriate to be a lower limit .",
    "there is thus little room for an initial @xmath26 below about  1600 .    assuming the trapezium cluster is merely the core of the onc , an upper limit @xmath31 is obtained for the whole onc .",
    "the lower value is valid if the overall binary proportion is @xmath13 , since about  3500 systems have been counted within approximately 2.5  pc of the cluster s centre ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "the upper limit is estimated by assuming @xmath12 as a probably more realistic value for most of the onc , implying that 7000  stars will have been counted , and that 30  per cent of all systems have been lost through expansion beyond the 2.5  pc radius , or have not been seen because they are too deeply embedded or too faint .      without doing additional time - consuming numerical experiments",
    ", the evolution of model clusters in virial equilibrium with different @xmath26 and @xmath17 can be assessed through simple scaling arguments .",
    "binary depletion occurs approximately on a crossing time - scale , @xmath32 ( fig .  3 in kpm ) , whereas the velocity dispersion and central density change on a time - scale comparable to the relaxation time , @xmath33 ( fig .  2 in kpm ) . that complete destruction of long - period or soft binaries occurs within a few tens of initial @xmath32",
    "is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ft_tcr ] , in which the evolution of @xmath34 for two very different clusters is compared . despite very different initial crossing times and different @xmath26 , @xmath34 decays on a comparable time - scale  @xmath35 . that the decay is not exactly in - phase does not affect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath38 is a structure constant of order unity defined by the details of the density distribution .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath39 , assuming the velocity distribution is isotropic . for @xmath9 and @xmath18",
    "pc , @xmath40  pc / myr ( 1  pc / myr@xmath41  km / s , but throughout this paper no distinction is made between these two units ) , and from fig .",
    "2 in kpm , @xmath42  km / s , so that @xmath43 throughout this paper .",
    "the typical crossing time , @xmath44 whereas the relaxation time in myr ( from binney & tremaine 1987 ) , @xmath45    thus , it is immediately apparent that increasing @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath46 ) will , for the same @xmath17 , _ shorten _ the time - scale for binary depletion while simultaneously _ slowing down _ the time - scale for the evolution of the central density and velocity dispersion .",
    "this implies that by increasing @xmath26 , the variation of the central density becomes increasingly negligible over the age of the cluster .",
    "this is already evident in fig .  2 in kpm , where the central density decays by a factor of  2.5 only during the first  myr .",
    "the central density for a plummer density distribution is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the plummer radius .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "two sets of initial models are constructed and compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_vir ] .",
    "one set of models has @xmath49 ( stars / pc@xmath5 ) , which is the same as in models  a. the other set has @xmath50 ( stars / pc@xmath5 ) , which is the same as the observed central density in the trapezium cluster .",
    "the first set is clearly not a viable solution set since the initial density remains too high ( @xmath33 is too long ) .",
    "however , there is a set of virial - equilibrium candidate solutions if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for the constraint @xmath53constant .",
    "these models have a velocity dispersion consistent with the observed value , and @xmath54  yr , which is sufficiently short for significant binary depletion to have occurred in the onc until now ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ft_tcr ] ) .",
    "fully self - consistent @xmath26-body calculations are needed to verify if a taurus  auriga - like binary population can be reduced to the observed level in the trapezium cluster .",
    "the calculations of kpm suggest that this is likely to be the case .    relaxing the constant - central density constraint , the full set of candidate solutions",
    "is obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scn_vir ] ) .",
    "as already apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_vir ] , the set of presumed solutions is _ very narrow _ , with @xmath55 and @xmath56  pc . it has been known for a long time that the velocity dispersion in the trapezium cluster is super - virial , if only the number of detected stars is used to estimate the cluster mass ( e.g. hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "however , the candidate solutions found here demonstrate that , by taking into account the binary companions , the natural loss of stars from the cluster through its dynamical evolution , and allowing for a small fraction of stars not detected yet , a model of the initial onc is found that is remarkably close to virial equilibrium .",
    "model  b2 in kpm shows that if the trapezium cluster is expanding then it is being observed now at a time when the velocity dispersion and central density have not decayed so much as to make the system appear like an association .",
    "expansion must have begun a few tens of thousands of years ago , and the initial @xmath34 must have been similar to that in the galactic field , and thus significantly below that in taurus  auriga .",
    "model  b2 assumes a high star - formation efficiency of @xmath57 , which nevertheless leads to an essentially rapid free expansion of the entire system ( kroupa & frink 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , lada , margulis & dearborn ( 1984 ) demonstrate that , if @xmath58 and gas is removed instantaneously , then an unbound , expanding association results",
    ". the presence of a few o  stars in the trapezium cluster suggests that the removal of gas occurred on a time - scale comparable to or shorter than a crossing time .",
    "the set of candidate solutions to an expanding trapezium cluster , assuming instantaneous gas removal and virial equilibrium of the stellar and gaseous system before gas expulsion , can be constrained by noting that the pre - expansion central density and velocity dispersion must have been larger than the presently observed values , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 refers to the gas - expulsion time .",
    "the central density can not be made arbitrarily large , since binary systems with semi - major axes as large as @xmath62  au exist in abundance ( section  2.3 in kpm ) .",
    "thus , if each binary system needs a volume with a radius @xmath63 to form , and the forming systems touch , then the maximum number density would be @xmath64 so that @xmath65  stars  pc@xmath66 for @xmath67 .    in a freely expanding flow that is unhindered by self - gravity , the velocity dispersion measured within a projected volume with a constant radius @xmath68 decreases with time according to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the velocity dispersion before gas expulsion , and @xmath71 is , as in section  [ sec : gen_vireq ] , the velocity dispersion of the stellar cluster if it were in virial equilibrium and without gas ( eqn .  [ eqn:1dvd ] ) .",
    "this equation ensures that the initial velocity dispersion , @xmath72 , is arrived at , and essentially measures the typical velocity , @xmath73 , of the stars remaining in the measurement area .",
    "the term @xmath74 is the time - lag until stars with typical velocity @xmath72 leave the area .",
    "the velocity - dispersion model - data corrected for the radial bulk flow plotted in the bottom panel of fig .  6 in kpm fit this relation very well with @xmath75  pc .",
    "that the flow in the kpm models  b is free on scales larger than a few tenths of a  pc is also demonstrated in kroupa & frink ( 1999 ) .",
    "the time at which @xmath76  km / s is @xmath77    in a free radial expansion flow , the central density in a plummer density distribution should evolve as @xmath78 because the plummer radius of the system increases with time as @xmath79 .",
    "however , the model data plotted in the upper panel of fig .  6 in kpm show that the real central density , evaluated within a radius @xmath3  pc , decreases much less rapidly .",
    "this is due to stellar - dynamical interactions in the binary - rich system leading to a part of the population decoupling from the flow and forming a small bound cluster , as discussed in section  5.2.1 in kpm .",
    "cooling of the flow through some binary destruction appears to be instrumental in forming this decoupled core , as can be inferred by comparing the central densities of models  b1 and  b2 at @xmath80  myr in fig .",
    "this mode of cluster formation will be addressed in more detail in a future contribution . for the present",
    ", it has to be accepted that the evolution of @xmath81 can not be expressed analytically .",
    "a set of possible initial models is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_exp ] . surmised solutions with @xmath8 and a star - formation efficiency of  42  per  cent have @xmath82  pc , ensuring that the pre - expansion velocity dispersion is larger than the observed value by at least a one - sigma error margin .",
    "such models lead to the velocity dispersion being consistent with the observed value within @xmath83  yr . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the candidate solutions have @xmath85  pc , ensuring the pre - expansion central density is larger than the currently observed value . in this case",
    "the pre - expansion velocity dispersion is very large , requiring a longer time to pass until the velocity dispersion has decayed to a value consistent with that observed .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath86  yr . candidate solutions with @xmath87 have @xmath88  pc and @xmath89  yr for @xmath90 .    the full set of candidate solutions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn_exp ] . for all candidate solutions , @xmath91  yr .",
    "the kpm calculations show that @xmath34 does not evolve significantly , so that @xmath92 is required at the time when expansion ensues .",
    "an initially homogeneous sphere with radius @xmath93 that starts from rest collapses to a singularity under its own gravity within a free - fall time , @xmath94 ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "if the initial matter distribution is not smooth , for example when only a finite number of stars is present , local density differences will lead to the growth of the tangential velocity dispersion which limits the radius of the collapse to the minimum value at the bounce ( aarseth , lin & papaloizou 1988 ) @xmath95 the post - collapse system exhibits a core - halo structure , and an initial asphericity will be retained to some degree by the halo , whereas the core will be approximately spherical ( boily , clarke & murray 1999 ) .",
    "this may , in principle , be a model of the onc , which has an approximately spherical core ( the trapezium cluster ) and an elliptical halo ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , provided the onc is old enough for the collapse to have progressed to the morphology evident today .",
    "the presence of a large number of primordial binary systems complicates the situation dramatically because they have relatively large interaction cross sections , and they constitute an energy sink as well as a highly significant energy source .",
    "a cold collapse can be envisioned being arrested when the densities become large enough that the binary systems begin interacting . at this stage cooling through binary disruption",
    "will reduce the relative velocities between the systems , slowing down the collapse .",
    "additionally , heating through hardening binaries will also oppose the collapse .",
    "vesperini & chernoff ( 1996 ) address such issues by considering the collapse of an initially homogeneous sphere with a binary proportion @xmath96 .",
    "they find that the primordial binaries do not alter the collapse and violent relaxation .",
    "however , their results are not applicable to the present work , since the binary proportion used here is significantly higher , and because the results of vesperini & chernoff apply to the case where binary  binary collisions are insignificant .",
    "binary  binary collisions , however , dominate the interactions in the realistic case considered here .",
    "details of the processes await further research .    during a cold collapse starting from an initially spherical and homogeneous configuration with initial ( central ) density @xmath97",
    ", the central density increases to a value at the bounce @xmath98 , given the above scaling for the linear dimension of the system .",
    "this is not fulfilled in models  c1 and  c2 , since this scaling and eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rhoc ] for @xmath99 , would imply @xmath100  [ stars / pc@xmath5 ] and @xmath102  [ stars / pc@xmath5 ] , whereas from fig .",
    "10 in kpm values of  @xmath103 and  @xmath104  stars / pc@xmath5 , respectively , result in the collapse computations .",
    "the central density at bounce is significantly smaller because ( i ) the models have a small but finite initial velocity dispersion , ( ii ) the initial density distribution is centrally concentrated leading to a spread of arrival times near the centre which increases @xmath105 , and ( iii ) binary systems oppose the collapse .",
    "similarly , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the system at bounce can not be calculated from a simple scaling law , because at this stage it is unknown how the binding energy of the binary - rich initially centrally concentrated cluster evolves . however , the data in the lower panel of fig .  10 in kpm suggest that , if @xmath106 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion a pre - collapse cluster would have were it in virial equilibrium ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn:1dvd ] ) , then @xmath107 for models  c1 and  c2 , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath108  km / s and  0.69  km / s ( eqn .  [ eqn:1dvd ] ) , respectively , so that @xmath109  km / s and  @xmath110  km / s .",
    "useful constraints can be placed on the candidate solution - set of pre - collapse models of the onc if eqn .",
    "[ eqn : vdb ] is adopted for a comparison with @xmath111 .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion at bounce must be _ larger _ than or equal to the observed value @xmath112 .",
    "also , the initial central density must be smaller than or equal to the presently observed value , @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , the collapse time must be short enough to be consistent with the pre - main sequence age of the trapezium cluster , @xmath114  myr , since the cluster could not have been collapsing stellar - dynamically for a time longer than the age of the stars .",

    "[ eqn : tcr ] ) . to estimate the constant of proportionality , the data presented in fig .",
    "10 of kpm need to be resorted to again .",
    "the result is @xmath117    sequences of initial models are constructed for @xmath8 and  @xmath118 , and @xmath99 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are calculated for each as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_col ] .",
    "there is no candidate set of solutions for @xmath8 , because the velocity dispersion at the bounce never reaches the observed value for those cases when the central pre - collapse density is smaller than the observed central density in the trapezium cluster .",
    "however , there is a candidate solution set for models with @xmath87 .",
    "such models have @xmath121  pc and should satisfy the observational constraints at some time @xmath122  myr during collapse .",
    "detailed @xmath26-body calculations are required to verify if this is indeed a viable solution set , and if the central density and velocity dispersion pass through the observational constraints at about the same time .",
    "the full set of candidate solutions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn_col ] .",
    "the results of kpm illustrate that @xmath123 decreases significantly during @xmath124 , but that the binary proportion after virialisation depends on the initial @xmath17 . thus , it is likely that initial @xmath125 ( i.e. a smaller binary proportion than in taurus  auriga ) will be necessary for presumed solutions with @xmath126  pc , to account for the observed binary proportion in the trapezium cluster .",
    "detailed @xmath26body calculations are needed to address this issue .",
    "the models investigated here assume the clusters initially have spherical and smooth plummer density profiles .",
    "deviations from this will not change the results significantly for the same @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath17 .",
    "a complication that will have to be incorporated in future studies of the evolution of the onc is the tidal field exerted across it from the nearby molecular cloud .",
    "kroupa & frink ( 1999 ) show that the overall shape and velocity field of an expanding young cluster can be affected noticeably in such a case .",
    "using stellar - dynamical scaling laws together with results from @xmath26-body calculations , three general classes of possible stellar - dynamical solutions to initial configurations of the onc ( and of the trapezium cluster ) are investigated . by doing so ,",
    "candidate initial models have been found for all three classes .",
    "thus , the onc may presently be ( i ) in or close to virial equilibrium , ( ii ) expanding , or ( iii ) collapsing or in violent relaxation following a cold collapse .",
    "class  ( i ) only allows a candidate solution in virial equilibrium with @xmath129  pc and @xmath130 .",
    "such a large @xmath26 is realistic only if the binary proportion in the onc ( rather than the trapezium cluster ) is close to unity , and if about 30  per cent of stars are not detected and/or have already been ejected to radii of a few  pc or larger .",
    "the first and third classes will undoubtedly lead to a bound galactic cluster , while the second is likely to , on the basis of the formation of a small bound cluster in the expanding trapezium - cluster models of kpm .",
