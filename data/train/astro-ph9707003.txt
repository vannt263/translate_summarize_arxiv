    "ngc 3227 is a seyfert 1.5 galaxy at a redshift of @xmath3=0.003 .",
    "it shows signs of interaction with its dwarf elliptical companion ngc 3226 .",
    "although studied in many spectral regions , most attention has focussed on the optical wavelength range : ngc 3227 has been the target of several blr mapping campaigns ( rosenblatt et al .",
    "1992 , salamanca et al .",
    "1994 , winge et al . 1995 ) and high - resolution line - profile studies ( e.g. whittle 1985 , rosenblatt et al .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of the kinematics and ionization structure of the circum - nuclear region were presented by mediavilla & arribas ( 1993 ) and arribas & mediavilla ( 1994 ) .",
    "rubin & ford ( 1968 ) and mundell et al . (",
    "1995a ) reported evidence for very high emission - line reddening .",
    "x - ray variability of ngc 3227 was detected with 1 by tennant & mushotzky ( 1983 ) , who found the flux to increase by a factor of 1.4 within 5 hours .",
    "variability was also found in the data ( turner & pounds 1989 ) and in an observation ( ptak et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "reichert et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , using data , favored a partial covering model to describe the ( 0.84.5 ) kev x - ray spectrum of ngc 3227 .",
    "differential variability between the le ( 0.052 kev ) and me ( 210 kev ) instruments was interpreted in terms of either partial covering with a strongly varying cold column or a variable soft excess ( turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "an unusually flat powerlaw of photon index @xmath4 1.5 was obtained .",
    "an iron k - emission line near 6.5 kev was detected in the spectrum of ngc 3227 ( pounds et al .",
    "this observation was modeled by george et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in terms of reflection from a cold accretion disk .",
    "the underlying x - ray continuum emission was then best described by a powerlaw with index = 1.86@xmath50.04 .",
    "given the lack of spectral resolution below @xmath0 1 kev in these studies , it was not possible to distinguish between alternative descriptions of the soft spectral shape and to evaluate the cause of variability .",
    "evidence for the presence of a warm absorber in ngc 3227 was indicated by netzer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) by the use of x - ray color diagrams , and reported by ptak et al . (",
    "1994 ) in an observation . as the cause for variability detected in the data , ptak et al . found two possibilities .",
    "one is a change in powerlaw index by @xmath6@xmath4 0.2 and constant properties of the ionized material .",
    "the other is complex behavior of the warm absorber with variability of both , ionization parameter and warm column density .    for the present study",
    ", we have analyzed the survey and archival pointed observations of ngc 3227 performed with the pspc ( trmper 1983 ; pfeffermann et al .",
    "since there is non - x - ray evidence for a large cold column of absorbing material along the line of sight ( e.g. cohen 1983 ) , and as the absorption structure of the comparatively lowly ionized warm absorber extends well below 0.5 kev , is particularly well suited for an investigation of these features .",
    "furthermore , in a sequence of studies to assess the possibility of a warm - absorber contribution to one of the known high - ionization emission - line regions in individual agn ( komossa & fink , e.g. 1997b ) , ngc 3227 marks the low - ionization end of the observed warm absorbers . in this context",
    ", it is also interesting to note that salamanca et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported the existence of broad wings in h@xmath7 in ngc 3227 that do not follow the continuum variability , indicating a higher than usual degree of ionization , as would be expected for a warm absorber .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present the observations . the data are analyzed with respect to their spectral and temporal properties in sects . 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "in sect . 5 , evidence for the presence of dust mixed with the warm absorber is presented and compared to alternative scenarios .",
    "further properties of the ionized material are derived and discussed , and the absorber - intrinsic line emission and absorption in the optical  uv spectral region is studied . a summary and the conclusions",
    "are provided in sect .",
    "a distance of 18 mpc is adopted for ngc 3227 assuming a hubble constant of @xmath8 = 50 km / s / mpc and the galaxy to follow the hubble flow .",
    "if not stated otherwise , cgs units are used throughout .",
    "the observation was performed with the pspc from may 8 - 19 , 1993 , centered on ngc 3227 .",
    "the total exposure time is 19.6 ksec .",
    "the source photons were extracted within a circle chosen to be large enough to ensure that all of the source counts were included , but small enough to contain negligible contribution from the much weaker neighboring source ngc 3226 .",
    "the background was determined after removing all detected sources within the inner 19 of the field of view .",
    "the data were corrected for vignetting and dead - time using the exsas software package ( zimmermann et al .",
    "the mean source count rate is about 0.5 cts / s . for the spectral analysis source photons in the amplitude channels",
    "11 - 240 were binned according to a constant signal / noise ratio of 21@xmath9 . for the temporal analysis",
    "the minimal bin size in time was 400 s to account for the wobble mode of the observation .",
    "ngc 3227 was observed during the all - sky survey ( rass ) from nov .",
    "12  15 , 1990 , with an effective exposure time of 610 s. it is clearly weaker in this observation as compared to the pointing . however , due to the larger effective pointspread function during the survey observations , it was not possible to exclude the contribution of the weak neighboring source ngc 3226 ( although the position of the centroid of the x - ray emission agrees with the coordinates of ngc 3227 )",
    ". therefore ,  sourcephotons within a circle including both objects were extracted .",
    "the background was determined from two source free sky fields along the scanning direction of the telescope .",
    "the data were corrected for vignetting .",
    "a total number of 52 source photons was detected .",
    "assuming ngc 3226 to have remained constant in count rate from the rass to the pointed observation ( with 0.018 cts / s ) , results in a count rate of 0.067 cts / s for ngc 3227 , revealing strong variability .",
    "unfortunately , the low number of photons accumulated during the rass does not allow a more detailed discussion of the spectral and temporal properties .",
    "a single powerlaw ( with cold absorption column as a free parameter ) is a bad description of the soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath10=1.7 ; table 1 ) .",
    "the resulting powerlaw is very _ flat _ , with an index @xmath11=1.2 , and strong systematic residuals remain ( fig . [ sedx ] ) .",
    "none of several single - component models that were compared with the data provides an acceptable fit .",
    "this also holds for 2-component ( powerlaw plus soft excess ) models in which the powerlaw index is fixed to 1.9 with all other parameters free .",
    "a powerlaw of free index with a soft excess , or a warm - absorbed powerlaw of canonical index ( next section ) give successful fits .",
    "the soft excess was parameterized as black body , for which we find @xmath12 0.07 kev , or the standard accretion disk model after shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the latter yields an unusually low black hole mass of @xmath13 3 @xmath14 m@xmath15 for fixed accretion rate @xmath16 = 1 , and a cold column density of @xmath17 @xmath18 ( table 1 ) . since also the underlying powerlaw is again unrealistically flat , with @xmath19 1.1 , in contradiction to the higher - energy observations ( e.g. george et al .",
    "1990 , @xmath19 1.9 ) , this model is not discussed further .",
    "finally , we applied a partial covering model to the data , in which part of an intrinsic powerlaw spectrum is directly seen , and part is absorbed by a very high cold column ( @xmath20 left free or fixed to 8.3 @xmath21 @xmath18 ; cf . table 2 ) .",
    "this approach is motivated by the evidence of large amounts of cold matter along the line of sight deduced from emission - line reddening , as is further discussed below .",
    "no successful description of the data was achieved .        to model the x - ray spectrum in terms of warm absorption",
    ", we have calculated a sequence of photoionization models for the warm material , using the code _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "we assume the material ( a ) to be photoionized by continuum emission of the central pointlike nucleus , ( b ) to be one - component and of constant density , and ( c ) to have solar abundances ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) . in those models that include dust mixed with the warm gas , dust properties like those of the galactic diffuse interstellar medium",
    "are adopted ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ; mrn ) if not mentioned otherwise , and the gas - phase abundances are depleted correspondingly ( a mean of cowie & songaila 1986 ) , as in ferland ( 1993 ) .",
    "the mrn dust consists of two grain species , graphite and astronomical silicate , and a powerlaw grain size distribution .",
    "the ionization state of the warm absorber can be characterized by the hydrogen column density @xmath22 of the ionized material and the ionization parameter @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number rate of incident photons above the lyman limit , @xmath26 is the distance between nucleus and warm absorber , @xmath27 is the hydrogen density ( fixed to 10@xmath28 @xmath29 unless noted otherwise ) and @xmath30 the speed of light .",
    "both quantities , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are determined from the x - ray spectral fits .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) chosen for the modeling corresponds to a ` mean seyfert ' continuum consisting of ( i ) piecewise powerlaws from the radio to the gamma - ray spectral region , or ( ii ) an additional euv bump parameterized as a black body of @xmath31 = 120000 k contributing the same amount to @xmath25 as the powerlaw component .",
    "as we have verified in a series of test calculations , the euv spectral shape generally has no strong influence on the x - ray properties of the warm gas , its ionization state is dominated by the x - ray part of the incident continuum ( komossa & fink 1997a ) .",
    "this also holds for the case of ngc 3227 .",
    "( the re - calculation of the models to include an additional euv bump was performed to check the robustness of predictions made for the absorber - intrinsic emission and absorption in lines in the optical and uv spectral region ; cf .",
    "sects 5.3.1 , 5.3.2 . )",
    "furthermore , the _ observed _ uv continuum of ngc 3227 is unusually steep which seems to be due to strong reddening ( sect .",
    "5.1.2 ) , whereas the warm absorber most probably sees the unreddened continuum .",
    "more explicitly , the mean seyfert sed employed consists of an uv - euv powerlaw of energy index @xmath32=1.4 ( kinney et al .",
    "1991 ) , extending up to 0.1 kev , a mean continuum after padovani & rafanelli ( 1988 ) from the radio to the optical region with a break at 10@xmath33 m and an energy index @xmath7 = 2.5 @xmath34-longwards , and an x - ray powerlaw that breaks into the gamma - ray region at 100 kev .",
    "since it turned out that the data do not allow to well constrain the underlying x - ray powerlaw index , it was usually fixed to ( i ) the canonical value of = 1.9 ( used if not stated otherwise ) , that was found for ngc 3227 by george et al .",

    "[ sh ] ) , implying that no strong spectral changes have taken place .    to further constrain the spectral variability during the observation , and to check for changes in the ionization state of the warm absorber in more detail , the total observation was split ( i ) into individual subsets ( referred to as ` orbits ' ) containing about 1000 to 2000 photons each , time - ordered , and merged in such a way , that only photons of comparable source flux - state are combined , ( ii ) into only two different subsets , ` high - state ' ( more than 0.51 counts / s ) and ` low - state ' .",

    "two spectral models are found to be of similar success , one is a dust - free warm absorber , the other one invokes dust mixed with the warm material .",
    "the presence of dust modifies the x - ray spectrum by absorption and scattering ( e.g. martin 1970 , martin 1978 , voit 1991 , laor & draine 1993 , czerny et al .",
    "it also influences the conditions in the gas by several heating and cooling processes ( e.g. draine & salpeter 1979 , ferland & netzer 1979 , baldwin et al .",
    "1991 , netzer & laor 1993 ) , like gas heating by grain photoionization and grain heating by collisions with gas particles .",
    "the clearest signature in the soft x - ray region is the presence of absorption edges that are produced by inner - shell photoionization ( e.g. martin & rouleau 1991 ; their figs 4,5 ) .",
    "the largest edge is that of carbon at an energy of @xmath0280 ev ( cf .",
    "[ wa_def ] ) ; the shift of the edge energy due to solid state effects ( martin 1970 ) is only of the order of a few ev ( e.g. greaves et al . 1984 ) .    due to the low abundance of dust",
    "as compared to the gas , and for typical cold galactic columns , x - ray dust features are usually not detectable , since it is difficult to distinguish from gas - phase absorption due to the same element if the gas is _",
    "cold_. however , since _ warm _",
    "gas is more transparent to very soft x - rays and typically of larger column density , dust signatures get more clearly visible . still , the carbon edge itself can not be resolved with .",
    "its presence clearly reduces the count rate in the low - energy channels , though .    since , for relatively high values of @xmath23 , dust effectively competes with the gas in the absorption of photons ( e.g. laor & draine 1993 ) , the spectral model involving a dusty absorber requires a higher ionization parameter than the dust - free one ( table 1 ) .",
    "a slightly larger total column density of the warm absorber is found for the dusty model , reflecting the depletion of gas - phase oxygen which is partly bound in the dust .    based on the quality of x - ray spectral fits only , no distinction between the dust - free and dusty warm absorber is possible in the case of ngc 3227 .",
    "arguments in favor of the latter model are given below .",
    "these are derived from a combination of the x - ray results with optical and uv properties of ngc 3227 .      as will be detailed in the following",
    ", there is evidence for a large amount of cold material along the line of sight to the active nucleus of ngc 3227 which should imprint its presence on the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "the evidence comes from emission line reddening : the broad h@xmath7/h@xmath67 ratio as measured by , e.g. , cohen ( 1983 ) implies an extinction of @xmath68 1.4 ( to derive @xmath69 , we have always assumed an unreddened value of h@xmath7/h@xmath67=3.1 ; if there is a very strong contribution from collisional excitation , the estimated amount of reddening is reduced ) . due to heating by the radiation field of the central continuum source , dust is not expected to survive in the blr ( e.g. barvainis 1987 , netzer 1990 , laor & draine 1993 ) . therefore , the material responsible for the broad line reddening should be located along the line of sight , between observer and blr . a dusty _ outer",
    "_ blr dominating the line emission with no clouds along the line of sight seems to be excluded by results from reverberation mapping .",
    "these show the bulk of the emission to originate very near the center ( @xmath70 ld ; salamanca et al .",
    "1994 , winge et al . 1995 ) where dust will be destroyed .",
    "if the dust that extincts the broad lines is accompanied by an amount of gas as typically found in the galactic interstellar medium , a large cold absorbing column is expected to show up in the soft x - ray spectrum . for the warm absorber fit to the x - ray spectrum , we found a cold column of @xmath71 @xmath18 , which is larger than the galactic value , @xmath56 @xmath18 , but only corresponds to @xmath69=0.3 .    mixing dust with",
    "the _ warm _ gas could supply the reddening without implying a corresponding _ cold _ column .",
    "for the dusty warm absorber description of ngc 3227 , the column density of the ionized gas is @xmath72 @xmath18 ( table 1 ) , resulting in @xmath68 3.1 which now somewhat overpredicts the reddening .",
    "we suggest a slightly modified grain size distribution with a higher abundance of larger dust grains , more similar to the large - r grains observed in the orion nebula ( e.g. mathis & wallenhorst 1981 , baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ) that are characterized by less extinction in the optical and uv . mixing orion - type dust within the warm material , instead of the standard mrn - type dust , the x - ray fit remains unchanged within the error bars .",
    "it also has to be kept in mind that the value of is not well constrained by the present observations . for a flatter powerlaw ( = 1.6 ; ptak et al .",
    "1994 instead of = 1.9 ; george et al . 1990 ) the column density of the dusty warm material ( sect .",
    "3.2.2 ) agrees with that estimated from broad line reddening without requiring changes in the dust properties .",
    "other evidence for reddening along the line of sight is also provided by the rather steep observed uv continuum of ngc 3227 . using the iue measurements in courvoisier & paltani ( 1992 ; lwp 2416 and swp 21778 ) , we find a powerlaw between 2206   and 1253   of index @xmath73 , whereas values of @xmath74 are typically found ( e.g. kinney et al .",
    "for comparison , extinction with @xmath69 = 3.1 would change an intrinsic index of @xmath75 to @xmath76 ( using the extinction curve as listed in osterbrock ( 1989 ; his table 7.2 ) ) . in the context of the dusty absorber scenario ,",
    "this again suggests dust with reduced uv  extinction properties as mentioned above .",
    "several determinations of reddening towards ngc 3227 are listed in table 2 .",
    "the cold absorbing column of @xmath71 @xmath18 required for a successful spectral fit of a dusty absorber is still larger than the galactic value .",
    "it is consistent with mundell et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , who find evidence for hi21 cm absorption towards the continuum - nucleus of ngc 3227 , with an estimated column density of @xmath55 @xmath18 .    finally , we note that even stronger reddening than that of the broad lines is occasionally reported for the narrow lines , which may , or may not , be linked to the presence of the warm absorber .",
    "the narrow h@xmath7/h@xmath67 ratio measured by , e.g. , cohen ( 1983 ) implies an extinction of @xmath68 1.2 .",
    "based on an observation taken at a different time ( dec .",
    "1993 ) , mundell et al .",
    "( 1995a ) report a much higher value .",
    "they find h@xmath7/h@xmath67=15 , which corresponds to @xmath68 4.5 .",
    "since under typical nlr conditions the emitted narrow balmer lines should always be close to their case b recombination ( brocklehurst 1971 ) value , a change in the h@xmath7/h@xmath67 ratio has to be attributed to extinction by dust .",
    "however , dust _ intrinsic _ to the narrow line clouds is not expected to in- and decrease by factors of several within years , suggesting the extinction to be caused by an external absorber along the line of sight .",
    "the expected accompanying very large cold absorbing column is not seen in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "both observations are not simultaneous , but they are only separated by 6@xmath77 months .",
    "dust internal to the _ warm _ gas could relax the strong time constraint set by the quasi - simultaneous optical and x - ray observations ; but would still require a very special geometry ( like the nlr emission being dominated by clouds directly along the l.o.s .",

    "the scenario is not discussed further here ; a confirmation of the puzzling optical observations would be valuable .",
    "an alternative possibility to explain the comparatively low cold column observed in the soft x - ray spectral region ( as compared to the column inferred from broad line reddening ) is that we see mainly scattered soft x - rays . in that case , however , the x - ray emission of ngc 3227 should not be that rapidly variable ( ptak et al .",
    "1994 ; our sect . 4.1 ) .",

    "to summarize , the extinction towards ngc 3227 seems to be caused by either ( i ) a warm absorber with internal dust , or ( ii ) overabundant dust in the cold column .",
