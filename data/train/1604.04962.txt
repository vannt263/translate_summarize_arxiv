    "in quantum field theory , supersymmetry ( susy ) generates transformations between boson and fermion , supplying us with a global framework to describe both kinds of particles using the same supersymmetric multiplet @xcite .",
    "witten was the first people who considered the simplest supersymmetric system composed of a particle of spin @xmath0 moving in one dimension @xcite , defining thus the algebra that the charge operators ( also called supercharges ) must meet and the way in which the supersymmetric hamiltonian is expressed in terms of them .",
    "these algebraic relations define what nowadays is called supersymmetric quantum mechanic ( susy qm ) .",
    "one of the simplest systems realizing susy qm is the so - called supersymmetric harmonic oscillator .",
    "it has been employed to illustrate how supersymmetry works , and it has been used also to introduce the supercoherent states , a supersymmetric generalization of the standard coherent states @xcite .    in order to perform the supercoherent states analysis , it is important to study the algebraic commutation relations between the hamiltonian @xmath1 and the creation @xmath2 and annihilation operators @xmath3 of the system .",
    "in fact , one starts by defining the susy annihilation operators ( sao ) by imposing a natural commutation relationship with @xmath1 .",
    "however , as it was shown in @xcite , the form of these operators is not unique . in a recent work , kornbluth and",
    "zypman @xcite have found a very general expression for the operator @xmath3 , as well as the explicit form for its eigenvectors @xmath4 with complex eigenvalues @xmath5 , the so - called supercoherent states . the last turn out to be expressed in terms of standard coherent states @xcite , defined for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator through the heisenberg - weyl algebra .",
    "it is possible to consider also a class of deformations preserving the structure given in @xcite . in this work",
    "we will analyze a particular deformation of the sao , the corresponding operator being labeled as @xmath6 .",
    "proceeding in a similar way as kornbluth and zypman , we are going to find the explicit form of its eigenvector @xmath7 with complex eigenvalue @xmath8 . due to the deformation employed",
    ", we will see that the eigenstates of @xmath6 are expressed now in terms of the corresponding nonlinear coherent states ( nlcs ) , which have been studied previously for nonlinear deformations of lie algebras @xcite .",
    "therefore , the states @xmath7 will be called nonlinear supercoherent states ( nlscs ) .",
    "on the other hand , due to the equidistant nature of its hamiltonian spectrum , the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator executes an evolution loop , a closed dynamical process such that the evolution operator becomes the identity ( up to a global phase factor ) at a certain time ( the so - called loop period , @xmath9 in our case ) .",
    "the evolution loops were introduced as the basis to produce arbitrary unitary operations , which is the subject of the dynamical manipulation problem @xcite , and they appear for systems ruled either by time - dependent or by time - independent hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , for systems executing an evolution loop , any quantum state turns out to be cyclic .",
    "starting from the work of berry @xcite , it has been realized that to any cyclic state one can associate a geometric phase @xmath10 , which characterizes global curvature effects of the space of physical states .",
    "in fact , the geometric phase turns out to be the holonomy of the horizontal lifting of the closed trajectory in projective hilbert space @xcite ( for a recent collection of articles about geometric phases see @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", the linear and nonlinear supercoherent states of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator become cyclic states , and it would be important to evaluate their associated geometric phases .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : level2 ] the standard and the simplest nonlinear coherent states will be quickly reviewed . in section",
    "[ sec : level3 ] the hamiltonian of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator , its eigenstates , eigenvalues , the annihilation and creation operators recently introduced by kornbluth and zipman , and its evolution loop will be discussed . in section [ sec : level4 ] a simple deformation of the previous ladder operators and the associated nonlinear supercoherent states will be constructed , while in section [ sec : level5 ] the corresponding geometric phases will be studied .",
    "our conclusions will be presented in section [ sec : level6 ] .",
    "before addressing the nonlinear coherent states , let us quickly review the standard harmonic oscillator ones .      a standard harmonic oscillator coherent state @xmath11 can be defined by the relation @xmath12 _ i.e. _ , it is a normalized eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath13 with complex eigenvalue @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , other definitions can be used to build this type of quantum states , which for the harmonic oscillator are equivalent to each other :    * they satisfy the minimum heisenberg uncertainty relation , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the uncertainties associated with the position and momentum operators , respectively . *",

    "the nonlinear coherent states ( nlcs ) have attracted a lot of interest because they exhibit nonclassical behavior . besides , many states in quantum optics can be viewed as a type of nlcs .",
    "some authors @xcite define a nonlinear coherent state @xmath28 as an eigenstate of the deformed annihilation operator @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a well behaved real function of the number operator @xmath32 and @xmath5 is the complex eigenvalue .",
