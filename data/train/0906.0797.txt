    "with the recent start of the up  and  coming experimental program of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , the search for new physics effects at the tev scale enters into an exciting era .",
    "in particular , due to the expected copious production of top quark events , clues of physics beyond the fermi scale could be evidenced .",
    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions of the top quark are good processes to look for signals of new physics , since the new dynamical effects are likely more evident in those top quark processes that are forbidden or strongly suppressed in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite . in the sm , the fcnc top transitions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 arise at the one  loop level , being considerably gim  suppressed , as they have branching ratios ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the decays involving in the final state the quark @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 are much more suppressed due to kobayashi  maskawa effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the three body @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite transitions have also been studied within the context of the sm .",
    "it was found  @xcite the surprising result that the branching rations for these decays are respectively one order of magnitude larger and of the same order of magnitude when compared with the two ",
    "body @xmath5 decay . beyond the sm ,",
    "fcnc top quark decays have been the subject of considerable interest in the literature , as they can have branching ratios much larger than the sm ones .",
    "these type of top transitions have been studied in some extended theories such as the two  higgs doublet model ( thdm )  @xcite , supersymmetric ( susy ) models with nonuniversal soft breaking  @xcite , susy models with broken r ",
    "parity  @xcite , models with extra @xmath15 gauge bosons  @xcite , and even more exotic scenarios  @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained within the context of effective theories  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in using the mass difference @xmath16 in the @xmath0 mixing recently observed by the babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations to impose a bound on the branching ratios for the fcnc top quark @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "it turns out that due to electromagnetic gauge invariance , the @xmath1 transition is somewhat restricted , as it can occurs only through two electromagnetic gauge structures of dipolar type , which are characterized by lorentz tensor structures of the form @xmath17 ( transition magnetic dipole moment ) , with @xmath18 the photon momentum , or @xmath19 ( transition electric dipole moment ) .",
    "the @xmath2 decay occurs through the analogous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moments .",
    "these interactions are naturally suppressed , as they can arise in renormalizable theories only through quantum fluctuations of one  loop or higher orders .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ effective - lagrangian",
    "] we briefly study the couplings arising from the effective lagrangian .",
    "section [ contributions ] is devoted to obtain the leading contribution of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 couplings to the mass difference @xmath16 of the @xmath0 mixing .",
    "finally , in section [ final - remarks ] we comment our results .",
    "the most general structure for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 couplings arise from the following dimension  six @xmath24invariant effective lagrangian : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for left and right  handed doublet and singlet of @xmath28 , respectively and a sum over quark flavor is implied . here ,",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the gauge tensors associated with the @xmath32 , @xmath28 , and @xmath33 groups , respectively . on the other hand , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the sm higgs doublet .",
    "in addition , the @xmath36 are the coefficients of general @xmath37 matrices defined in the flavor space , whereas @xmath38 represents the new physics scale",
    ". this parametrization allow us to treat in a model  independent way fcnc transitions in the up quark sector and @xmath39 . ]",
    "mediated by massless gauge bosons .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath40 can be diagonalized as usual via the @xmath41 and @xmath42 unitary matrices , which relate gauge states to mass eigenstates . in particular , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 vertices are given by the following lagrangian : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are vectors in the flavor space .",
    "notice the presence of the global factor @xmath47 , which arises from the higgs mechanism and is common to both electromagnetic and strong couplings . in the above expression ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are flavor matrices given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 gev is the fermi scale and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) stands for cosine ( sine ) of the weak angle . to generate vector ",
    "mediated fcnc effects at the tree level in the effective theory , it is assumed that the @xmath54 matrices diagonalize the yukawa mass matrix @xmath55 but not the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from the above expressions , it is immediate to derive the vertex functions for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath58 ) couplings , which can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as we will see below , it is not possible to isolate the contribution of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) couplings from the @xmath0 mixing .",
    "this contribution is given through an amplitude that depends symmetrically on both vertices .",
    "due to this , it is not possible to obtain bounds for the @xmath6 and @xmath5 decays without making additional assumptions .",
    "we now are in position of deriving the contribution of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 vertices to the mass difference @xmath16 of the @xmath0 mixing .",
    "these contributions occur through short distance effects characterized by the box diagrams shown in fig.[fig1 ] . neglecting the external momenta ,",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 couplings generate an amplitude given by : @xmath68 the integral involved in ( [ qdiv ] ) is of the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and it diverges quadratically at @xmath72 . as discussed in reference  @xcite , the use of cutoffs to regularize quadratic or higher divergent integrals would violate the decoupling theorem , as this scheme introduce a strong dependence on the new physics scale . in our case , the use of a cutoff leads to an amplitude proportional to @xmath73 , which would overestimate our prediction .",
    "only a logarithmic dependence on the new physics scale is physically acceptable  @xcite ( for some applications of dimensional regularization in effective lagrangians see , for instance , refs .",
    "thus , we do not use a cutoff to regularize our amplitude , instead we will use dimensional regularization , which allow one to convert the quadratic divergence into a logarithmic one through the following limit  @xcite : @xmath74 . \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the arising integral with logarithmic divergence , @xmath75 , can be treated in the usual manner , hence a renormalization scheme can directly be applied to the amplitude in ( [ qdiv ] ) .",
    "once the integral is solved , one obtains the result for the amplitude : @xmath76 where the ultraviolet divergence is contained in @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 the euler s constant . here , @xmath80 is the dimensional regularization scale .",
    "following refs.@xcite , the divergent term in this amplitude can be absorbed by renormalizing the appropriated coefficients of the complete effective lagrangian since it already contains all the invariants allowed by the sm symmetry .",
    "the invariants needed to absorb the divergences are of the form @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , etc . using the @xmath84 renormalization scheme with @xmath85 , the renormalized amplitude can be written as follows : @xmath86 where we have defined the dimensionless function @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to see that this amplitude can be obtained directly from a four  quark effective interaction @xmath88 where the dimension ",
    "six operator @xmath89 is well known in the literature  @xcite . in the above expression , a factor of @xmath90",
    "was introduced in order to compensate the @xmath91 wick contractions .    on the other hand , the mass difference @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 which in our case takes the form @xmath94 where the expressions for @xmath95 given in ref.@xcite were used . here",
    ", @xmath96 is the @xmath92 decay constant .",
    "we will use the cleo collaboration determination @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath98 is unknown , but lattice calculation  @xcite leads to @xmath99 , although in vacuum saturation and in the heavy quark limit it approximates to the unity . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we will use @xmath100 . using the value @xmath101 gev ,",
    "one obtains @xmath102 from the experimental side , the heavy flavor averaging group  @xcite interpretation of the current data leads to a mass difference of @xmath0 given by @xmath103 gev @xcite . to bound the @xmath104 coefficients",
    ", we demand that the above contribution does not exceed the experimental uncertainty , which leads to @xmath105 where it was assumed that @xmath106 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable  @xcite , as a new physics scale in the tevs region is expected . considering the electromagnetic and strong contributions one at the time , one obtains @xmath107 , so that a conservative point of view allow us to obtain the bounds @xmath108 and @xmath109 without making additional assumptions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the branching ratios for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays are given by @xmath110 from these expressions and from eqs.([b1],[b2 ] ) , we obtain the following bounds for these decays @xmath111 where the approximation @xmath112 gev for the total top decay width was used .",
    "it is worth comparing our results with those predictions obtained in some specific models .",
    "most of the known results are on the @xmath6 and @xmath5 decays , which are strongly suppressed in the sm , with branching ratios of order of @xmath10 and @xmath113  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the branching ratios for the decays involving the quark @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 are even more suppressed by a kobayashi  maskawa factor of @xmath114 . beyond the sm ,",
    "these branching ratios are considerably enhanced .",
    "for instance , in the thdm - iii , the @xmath6 and @xmath5 decays can have a branching ratio in the range @xmath115 and @xmath116  @xcite , respectively . on the other hand , the respective predictions in some susy models  @xcite",
    "are of order of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "an effective lagrangian analysis of higgs  mediated fcnc leads to branching ratios for these decays of order of @xmath119 and @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "all these predictions are consistent with our bound , as it is expected that the branching ratios for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays are lower by two or higher orders of magnitude than those involving the quark @xmath12 .",
    "to conclude , we would like to comment on the possible detection of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays at the lhc . on the light of our bounds for their branching ratios",
    ", one can conclude that they are within reach of this collider , given the important production of @xmath121 events of several millions per year . in a purely statistical basis those channels with branching ratios larger than about @xmath120 do have the chance of being detected .",
    "however , the observability of a particular channel decay depends on several factors , background and systematics may reduce this value by several orders of magnitude depending of the particular signature . for instance",
    ", the @xmath2 decay would require a large branching in order to be detected as it is swamped by hadronic backgrounds .",
    "however , the important difference of about three orders of magnitude between the observability parameter and our bound makes quite possible the observation of this channel .",
    "as far as the @xmath1 mode is concerned , it could be detected even with a relatively small branching ratio because it would be produced in a cleaner environment . in conclusion",
    ", our analysis suggests that the recent observation of @xmath0 mixing does not exclude the possibility of observing the rare top quark decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the lhc .",
    "since the @xmath122 and @xmath109 couplings are not directly constrained by this experimental result , their observation at the lhc would be more probable .",
    "simultaneous contribution of the @xmath122 and @xmath123 couplings to the @xmath0 mixing .",
