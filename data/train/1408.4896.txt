    "the standard scenario of galaxy formation predicts that baryonic gas falls into dark matter potentials and gets heated to the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "this gas then cools radiatively , and if the temperature is low enough ( @xmath6 k ) for significant radiation loss , then most of the galactic halo gas drops to low temperature and no accretion shock develops in the halo @xcite . in the case of low mass galaxies ,",
    "most of the accretion takes place through the infall of cold material from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "however , in massive galaxies , the hot halo gas cools slowly and should remain warm / hot for a considerable period of time .",
    "this halo gas , if present , could potentially contain a large fraction of the baryons in the universe which is unaccounted for by collapsed gas and stars in galaxies , and could explain the missing baryon problem @xcite .",
    "although numerical simulations have shown that disc galaxies should be embedded in a hot gaseous halo , this gas has been difficult to nail down observationally because of faintness of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "recent observations have finally discovered this hot coronal gas extended over a large region around massive spiral galaxies @xcite .",

    "the amount of material implied in this extended region is unlikely to come from the star formation process , as shown by @xcite .",
    "an extended region of circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) has also been observed through ovi absorption lines around massive galaxies at @xmath11 @xcite , although these observations probe clouds at @xmath12 k.    at the same time , the presence of hot halo gas around the milky way galaxy has been inferred via ram pressure arguments from the motion of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the density profile of the hot coronal gas in our galaxy is rather flat out to large radius , with @xmath13 @xmath9 .",
    "theoretically , one can understand this profile from simple modelling of hot , high entropy gas in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . while in galaxy clusters ,",
    "the high entropy of the diffuse gas produces a core , for massive galaxies ( with implied potential wells shallower than in galaxy clusters ) , the core size is relatively large and extends to almost the virial radius .",
    "one of the implications of this hot coronal gas in the halos of massive galaxies is the sz distortion of the cmbr @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath14 distortion of the cmbr from massive galaxies is likely to be small .",
    "however , the anisotropy power spectrum could have a substantial contribution from the hot gas in galactic halos . the sz distortion from galaxy clusters",
    "have been computed with the observed density and temperature profiles of the x - ray emitting gas , or the combined pressure profile ( e.g , @xcite ) . in the case of the galactic halos , because of the expected flat density profile , the resulting @xmath14-distortion could be larger than that of galaxy clusters for angular scales that correspond to the virial radii of massive galaxies , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "these angular scales are being probed now and therefore the contribution to the sz signal from galactic halos is important . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the angular power spectrum from both the thermal and kinetic sz effects , if a fraction @xmath15 of the total baryonic content of massive galaxies is in the form of hot or ionized halo gas .",
    "although such a fraction of gas has been estimated from the observations of ngc 1961 and ngc 6753 @xcite , it remains uncertain whether it is a representative value , or whether it can be as low as @xmath16 .",
    "recent studies of absorption from halo gas along the lines of sight to background quasars show that roughly half of the missing baryons is contained in the halo as warm ( at @xmath17 and @xmath18 k ) components .",
    "we also discuss the possible sz signatures from this cool - warm gas in galactic halos .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that galactic halos contain a constant fraction of the total halo mass , independently of the galaxy mass . if we consider the total baryon fraction @xmath19 , and the fraction of the total mass that is likely to be in the disc , which is predicted to be @xmath20 @xcite , then one can assume a fraction @xmath21 of the total halo mass to be spread throughout the halo .",

    "we have calculated the sz distortion from galactic halos containing warm and hot circumgalactic gas . for the hot halo gas , we have calculated the angular power spectrum of the distortion caused by halos in which the gas cooling time is longer than the halo destruction time - scale ( galactic halos in the mass range of @xmath211 m@xmath3 .",
    "the sz distortion signal is shown to be significant at small angular scales ( @xmath212 ) , and larger than the signal from galaxy clusters .",
    "the kinetic sz signal is found to dominate over the thermal sz signal for galactic halos , and also over the thermal sz signal from galaxy clusters for @xmath116 .",
