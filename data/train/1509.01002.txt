    ", a comparison between preceding classical calculations  @xcite and quantum calculations  @xcite on the honeycomb iridate spin model suggests that , even for the quantum @xmath224 case , physics discussed in this paper may hold true in those parameter regions with higher magnetic ordering temperatures .",
    "such parameter regions cover most of the physically relevant parameter regions ( @xmath227 ) , including one of the ` candidate ' parameter points , i.e. the su(2 ) point @xmath228 . in these regions ,",

    "firstly , the z@xmath3-z@xmath4 phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at @xmath199 are expected to move into the z@xmath3 phase side due to the quantum fluctuation .",
    "this is because the finite-@xmath11 first order phase boundary between z@xmath3 and z@xmath4 phases is slanted in a way that the z@xmath4 phases are more stabilized against the z@xmath3 phase by the thermal effect ( fig .",

    ", this indicates that , around the phase boundary , the z@xmath4 sb states have more low energy classical spin configurations ` proximate ' to themselves than the competing z@xmath3 sb state has . here",
    "we define a given classical spin configuration `` @xmath75 '' to be more ` proximate ' to `` @xmath76 '' than to `` @xmath77 '' when @xmath229 , where `` @xmath230 '' denotes the inner product between two spin configurations with respect to spin index and site index .",
    "crudely speaking , the quantum zero - point energy  @xcite can be regarded as the second - order energy correction to the classical ground state , which comes from the virtual hopping processes between the classical ground state @xmath231 and another classical spin states with higher classical energies @xmath232 ; @xmath233 here @xmath234 stands for the quantum fluctuation term , comprising ` off - diagonal ' terms such as @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 with @xmath238 , while @xmath239 being the holstein - primakoff boson ( creation ) operator at the @xmath240-th site .",
    "the zero - th order part @xmath241 comprises ` diagonal ' terms such as @xmath242 , giving the classical energies to each classical spin states e.g. @xmath243 .",
    "the indication of the finite-@xmath11 phase boundary between z@xmath3 and z@xmath4 phases in combination with eq .",
    "( [ quantum ] ) suggests that , near the z@xmath3-z@xmath4 phase boundaries at @xmath199 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b , c ) , the quantum zero - point energy of the z@xmath4 states will be larger than that of the z@xmath3 state .",
    "namely , the z@xmath4 states have possibly more low - energy classical spin configurations ( @xmath244 ) connecting with z@xmath4 states by the local perturbation @xmath234 than the z@xmath3 state does . as a result , the z@xmath3-z@xmath4 classical phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b , c ) are expected to move into the z@xmath3 phase side , when the quantum fluctuation is included perturbatively .",
    "in fact , one can find in a recent literature  @xcite a model calculation on a different spin system , whose observation agrees with the thoughts given above .",
    "one may also notice from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) that the finite-@xmath11 phase boundary between z@xmath3 and z@xmath4 phases is constrained in the @xmath79 plane .",
    "this exceptional feature is , however , due to the additional symmetry at @xmath79 ( appendix a ) .",
    "another possible quantitative change could be found in the finite - size crossover phenomena in the z@xmath4 phase , which may be effectively characterized by the @xmath245-dimensional z@xmath4 ferromagnetic potts model . in the effective model , the quantum effect is taken into account as an addition of the imaginary time dimension ( + 1 ) to the spatial dimension ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "the 4d z@xmath4 potts model exhibits the same kind of finite - size crossover phenomena with different crossover exponent  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the ( 3 + 1)d model , finite temperature leads to a non - trivial ` finite - size ' effect along the imaginary time direction , in the same way as the finite system size does along the spatial direction .",
    "thus , one may even expect that the z@xmath4 ordered phase accommodates two distinct crossover temperatures below a finite critical ordering temperature @xmath89 ; one is associated with the spatial fluctuation of spins and the other with their temporal fluctuation .",
    "in this paper , we obtained a comprehensive classical magnetic phase diagram for the hyperkagome iridate .",
    "we clarified the origin of the z@xmath4 anisotropy and finite-@xmath11 ordering nature of the z@xmath247 phases .",
    "our finite-@xmath11 classical phase diagram suggests that the z@xmath4 phases could be further stabilized against the competing z@xmath3 phase by the quantum order by disorder .",
    "based on the finite-@xmath11 crossover behavior in the z@xmath4 sb phase , let us finally introduce a possible phenomenology of na-438 powder samples .",
    "firstly we assume that polycrystalline grain size is as small as 1@xmath248 m @xmath88 0.1@xmath248 m and we regard that a broad peak in specific heat observed around @xmath249 in experiments  @xcite corresponds to the onset temperature of the z@xmath4 sb phase ( @xmath89 ) . the fns argument above claims that , below but near @xmath89 , a system smaller than the crossover system size @xmath250 behaves as if it has no z@xmath4 anisotropy term .",
    "spins in such a small grain collectively develop a finite amplitude of @xmath251 below @xmath89 , while the phase of @xmath252 still strongly fluctuates and so does that of individual spins .",
    "thus , any local spin moment seen by probe spins can be averaged to be zero in the intermediate temperature regime @xmath253 . for @xmath254 cubic unit cells ,",
    "the crossover system size is evaluated to be @xmath255 cubic unit cells for @xmath256 ( @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 @xmath248 m with a=8.95 @xmath261 ) . on further lowering temperature ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath262 becomes shorter and so does @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 exceeds the grain size on lowering temperature ( @xmath130 ) , the z@xmath4 anisotropy becomes prominent and the phase of @xmath252 starts to be locked into the six minima . as explained above , this locking breaks the point group symmetry , giving rise to the uniaxial lattice distortion via spin - lattice coupling .",
    "since neighboring grains in polycrystalline sample are expected to be randomly oriented against one another , the locking or its onset around @xmath263 with the uniaxial distortion will conflict with the grain structure .",
    "this may result in a ` configurationally degenerate phase with fluctuating order ' as suggested in the experiment  @xcite .",
