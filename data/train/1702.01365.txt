    ". a closely related observation : fluid inside a piston expanding to near - vacuum can only perform a finite amount of mechanical work , or conversely , it takes only a finite amount of energy to compress a large quasi - vacuum volume of fluid to any positive finite density .",
    "( these properties are not immediately obvious ; they are calculated from the pressure law under consideration and may be false for `` exotic '' pressure laws . )    bodies with _",
    "several _ protruding corners appear to have been studied mostly in the incompressible case , where conformal mapping techniques allow explicit solutions for a large variety of particular profiles ; less attention has been paid to unbounded velocities since they are tolerated by since incompressible models . starting from the prior work of finn and gilbarg and earlier authors",
    ", @xcite considers compressible flow around bounded simple polygons ( which have at least three protruding corners ) , showing that there are _ no _ nontrivial . ] low - mach number solutions , regardless of how the corner locations are chosen ; since their coordinates provide ample free parameters , this non - existence may be a bit surprising on the surface .",
    "the proof works by reduction to the incompressible case , where it is shown that no solution has bounded velocity at every corner .",
    "this statement in turn is reduced to the _ utility graph _ theorem : the bipartite graph @xmath2 , with three vertices connected to each of three other vertices , does not have an embedding into the plane ; the three corners represent one set of vertices while the other set corresponds to the region of positive streamfunction , the region of negative streamfunction and the body , at which the streamfunction is zero .",
    "but the proof idea falls well short for profiles with _ two _ protruding corners , since planar embeddings of the @xmath3 graph are easy to find . besides , nontrivial flows are easy to find , for example the horizontal plate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonalplate ] center ) .",
    "however , such examples should be considered `` non - generic '' : given the profile , there is only one free real scalar parameter ( circulation ) , but there are two separate real scalar constraints ( from velocity boundedness at each corner ) ; for `` generic '' profiles the problem appears overdetermined .    this heuristic argument is made precise in this article in several ways .",
    "we prove non - existence of nontrivial compressible uniformly subsonic flows for two ( overlapping ) classes : profiles where the corners are the points of maximal and minimal vertical coordinate of the body ( theorem [ th : yminmax ] ) , and profiles that are symmetric across the flow axis , with corners not on the axis ( theorem [ th : verticalsymmetry ] ) .",
    "these two theorems show non - existence for all non - horizontal flat plates , as well as many of the _ krmn - trefftz _ symmetric lenses .",
    "additional theorems covering more classes can be imagined , but it seems difficult to give a single criterion covering arbitrary profiles . for those we focus on the low - mach case and prove ( theorem [ th : smallmach ] ) : if a profile does not admit nontrivial incompressible flows with bounded velocity , then nontrivial compressible flows with mach numbers below a certain threshold do not exist either .",
    "the incompressible case is easier to check , for example by conformal mapping techniques ; indeed they allow us to cover all remaining lens cases .",
    "if irrotational subsonic inviscid flows do not exist , there are two alternatives .",
    "the most natural one is to consider that in reality vorticity is shed from solid surfaces ; this is an important mechanism for generating _ drag _ in the low - viscosity low - mach regime .",
    "another option is to consider transonic solutions , i.e.  supersonic regions at the solid .",
    "supersonic bubbles _ are well - known in subsonic but nearly sonic flow at smooth outwardly curved boundary parts ; protruding corners can be considered an extreme case .",
    "transition to supersonic flow is less likely at low mach numbers ; in any case , supersonic bubbles generally end in shock waves that produce vorticity ( although mathematically rigorous existence proofs for such bubbles are still a subject of ongoing research ) .",
    "we conclude that  even in complete absence of viscosity  solid bodies with more than one protruding corner generally produce vorticity , in the sense of not allowing any irrotational solution .",

    "can not be contained in a horizontal line ( else @xmath251 would be a nontrivial incompressible flow around it ) , so @xmath95 must ( be smooth and ) have non - horizontal tangent in some point , where the slip condition requires @xmath249 to to be tangential , hence ( zero , else we could simply obtain @xmath252 in some point at the body . ] or ) @xmath253-uniformly _ not _ eastward .",
    "therefore the diameter of the set of values @xmath254 is at least comparable to @xmath255 , @xmath253-uniformly .",
    "hence with @xmath256 we obtain that @xmath257 has diameter @xmath10 but is also @xmath253-uniformly bounded .    since @xmath258 also satisfies the planar uniformly elliptic pde @xmath259 morrey estimates ( @xcite , @xcite ) yield that @xmath260 is @xmath253-uniformly @xmath261 locally uniformly in @xmath262 .",
    "@xmath261 is compactly embedded in @xmath263 , so we may restrict to a subsequence so that @xmath264 and @xmath265 converge in @xmath263 locally in @xmath262 , and same for @xmath266 which is a smooth function of @xmath260 , and from @xmath267 convergence in the distributional sense yields the incompressible limit @xmath268 with constant @xmath269 .",
    "moreover since @xmath260 is @xmath253-uniformly bounded , and since the boundary is piecewise @xmath111 , the slip condition @xmath270 is inherited from @xmath258 .",
    "the complex potential @xmath273 ( @xmath274 branch cut just below the negative real axis ) satisfies the slip condition @xmath275 on the unit circle . by rotational invariance",

    "the idea of the krmn - trefftz transformation is to compose with a conformal map that deforms the circle into profiles with corners . to create corners of prescribed angle ,",
    "it is natural to use fractional powers @xmath278 ( same branch cut ) .",
    "they are conformal at @xmath279 , but deform angles at @xmath280 ; we want the opposite , so we first apply the map @xmath281 which swaps @xmath282 with @xmath280 .",
    "define @xmath283 the image of the unit circle under @xmath284 is a `` symmetric lens '' with corners @xmath285 and @xmath286 of exterior ( fluid ) corner angle @xmath287 , with horizontal flat plate ( @xmath288 ) and unit circle ( @xmath289 ) as special cases .",

    "since @xmath291 is its own inverse , we get @xmath292 the @xmath293-plane complex potential is @xmath294 @xmath295 by choice , so @xmath296 is unbounded at the corners @xmath297 .",
    "hence the complex velocity @xmath298 can be bounded at the trailing edge @xmath299 only if @xmath300 analogously requiring bounded velocity at the _ leading _ corner @xmath301 yields @xmath302 clearly we can not satisfy both conditions unless @xmath303 ( or @xmath304 ) , i.e.  the case of horizontal lenses .",
    "we have constructed one flow for each @xmath1 , and by uniqueness ( proposition [ prop : vgam - uq ] ) there are no other ones .",
    "thus , krmn - trefftz symmetric lenses admit bounded - velocity nontrivial incompressible flows only if the line between the corners is parallel to @xmath190 .",
    "otherwise , by theorem [ th : smallmach ] nontrivial low - mach compressible flows do not exist , even in the cases not covered by theorem [ th : verticalsymmetry ] and [ th : yminmax ] .    for horizontal lenses we can exploit symmetry by putting a slip - condition straight wall onto the horizontal axis , obtaining an elliptic problem in the upper halfplane , with all fluid - side corner angles smaller than @xmath147 , crucially yielding hlder - continuous corner gradients in case of dirichlet boundary conditions ( see @xcite for unique solvability of the linearization in weighted hlder spaces and a priori estimates ) .",
    "however , some particular unsymmetric profiles should also admit proofs of existence ; that would require a more careful analysis of the corner constraints and their relationship to circulation and angle of attack ."
