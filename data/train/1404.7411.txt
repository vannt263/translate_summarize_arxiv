    "in 1989 , godrche and luck @xcite introduced a ( locally ) randomised extension of the well - studied fibonacci substitution .",
    "they presented first results concerning the topological entropy and the spectral type of the diffraction measure . in this context , it is most remarkable that the dynamical hull features positive entropy but at the same time is regular enough to contain only meyer sets .",

    "5.1 ) for the computation of the topological entropy rely on the fact that it is sufficient to merely control the growth behaviour of exact random fibonacci words .",
