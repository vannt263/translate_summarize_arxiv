    "this is because loops in the bulk get a weight @xmath208 , which can be obtained simply by summing over two possible orientations .",

    "<S> , we still find excellent agreement for @xmath124 . </S>",

    "<S> this is precisely the case @xcite , where ( [ vvv3pt ] ) is interpreted as the probability that @xmath74 belong to the same fk cluster . </S>",
    "<S> actually , one can show @xcite that the space of states on which the transfer matrix is acting splits , when @xmath130 and _ only _ then , into two isomorphic subspaces , which are technically irreducible representations of the lattice ( periodic temperley - lieb ) algebra underlying the dynamics of the model ; see sm for more details . </S>",
    "<S> numerical methods and their associated normalizations measure the three - point constant within one subspace only ( selected by the boundary conditions imposed at the ends of the cylinder ) , while , by analyticity , the liouville result holds for the whole space of states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads , by easy considerations on ( [ ratiocyl ] ) , to a measured three - point constant which is too large by a factor @xmath43 for @xmath127 .    </S>",
    "<S> the we consider in some detail here is when one of the charges vanishes , say @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex operator then has @xmath132 . in ordinary cft </S>",
    "<S> this would imply @xmath133 , the identity operator , so that ( [ vvv3pt ] ) reduces to a two - point function , equal to zero by conformal invariance , unless @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> however , ( [ zamoc ] ) does not exhibit this feature at all , and the function @xmath129 remains highly non - trivial even when one of the arguments vanishes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we still have @xmath135 , compatible with the normalization of two - point functions , but in general @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> this will be illustrated numerically below .    to discuss the corresponding geometrical meaning </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the loop model with @xmath137 . according to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopconfs]a the weight of a loop encircling @xmath64 ( or @xmath77 ) depends on whether it _ also _ encircles @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath65 is not invisible at all , and @xmath138 is in fact a _ marking _ operator , distinct from @xmath139 , even though @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the three - point function ( [ vvv3pt ] ) is then @xmath140 where we have , for the time being , considered an unnormalized quantity , where the ( unknown ) lattice cutoff @xmath141 appears explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> this depends on @xmath65 ( despite @xmath132 ) , implying a non - zero derivative wrt @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath142 acts non - trivially on @xmath143 , and this field is _ non - degenerate_. we now send @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of loops encircling both @xmath65 and at least one of the other two points becomes negligible , so we get rid of the marked point . </S>",
    "<S> the first scale factor above disappears , and we can then get rid of the second one by normalizing with the two - point function . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath145 where @xmath146 now denotes the partition function where loops encircling @xmath64 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 ) get weight @xmath103 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath104 ) , while those encircling both points get weight @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can keep @xmath105 generic ( so that @xmath147 ) , send @xmath148 as before , but choose the microscopic boundary conditions so that no loop can encircle @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> loops encircling both @xmath64 and @xmath77 then get the non - trivial weight @xmath105 , and the ratio ( [ ca1a3 ] ) produces @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loopconfs]b </S>",
    "<S> .    we can also simplify ( [ ca1a3 ] ) even further by noticing that @xmath129 remains non - trivial even when _ two _ of the charges @xmath45 vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we have then @xmath149 here , @xmath150 is the partition function where loops encircling @xmath64 but not @xmath77 get a weight @xmath103 .    we have checked these interpretations of @xmath151 and @xmath152 numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ca00 ] . for the potts model one obtains similar results , except that now @xmath153 is observed when @xmath154 , as can again be seen from ( [ ratiocyl ] ) and the splitting of the state space .    </S>",
    "<S> -0.6 cm   and @xmath155 as functions of @xmath103 in the dense and dilute o(@xmath46 ) model with @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the two positions of the vertex operator @xmath70at one extremity or in the middle of the cylinder  give different microscopic results , but their @xmath156 limits agree with the same analytical formula . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] -0.9 cm    summarizing , the loop model with four different weights ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : loopconfs]a ) gives a consistent interpretation of the three - point function in @xmath1 liouville . </S>",
    "<S> it is also consistent with interpreting @xmath129 as an _ </S>",
    "<S> ope coefficient_. this can be seen geometrically by considering the limit @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of loops with weight @xmath105 or @xmath104 is then negligible , since they would have to be `` pinched '' between @xmath65 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , loops get weight @xmath103 whenever they encircle @xmath64 or @xmath65 , and @xmath46 if they encircle both . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we recover  up to a numerical factor , and after subtracting the divergence at @xmath158the two - point function of operators with charge @xmath159 , which explains in what sense a _ continuum _ of @xmath159 charges </S>",
    "<S> appears in the fusion of charges @xmath160 and @xmath161 .    </S>",
    "<S> the loop model also gives natural explanations to a well - known paradox encountered in trying to make @xmath3 liouville into a consistent cft . </S>",
    "<S> we see here that the vertex operator with @xmath162 must be interpreted not as the identity but as a ` marking ' operator , a feature very similar to what happens in the sle construction . for instance , in the cft proof @xcite of schramm s left - passage formula @xcite a point - marking ( or `` indicator '' @xcite ) operator of zero conformal weight  but distinct from the identity operator  </S>",
    "<S> is used to select the correct conformal block in the corresponding correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments can be made within boundary cft @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize ( more details in sm ) that nothing special seems to appear as @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the loop model does not produce the singularities in the three - point function obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is , from our point of view , quite expected , since the model in @xcite is obtained as the @xmath164 limit of the @xmath165 rsos models , whose relationship with the loop model is not straightforward , and involves a complicated sum over sectors .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope to report later on the study of @xmath166 point functions , and to explore the geometrical definitions necessary when even more different loop weights are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> boundary extensions of this work also offer tantalizing possibilities .    </S>",
    "<S> similar three - point functions can be defined involving , instead of loops with modified weights , the so - called watermelon or fuseau @xcite operators . in cg parlance , </S>",
    "<S> the electric operators @xmath96 are then replaced by magnetic operators @xmath167 inserting @xmath168 defect lines . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined numerically the corresponding @xmath129 , the simplest of which ( all @xmath169 ) determining the probability that three points lie on the same loop . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results do not match formula ( [ zamoc ] ) when the corresponding @xmath170 are entered , and seem to correspond to another continuation of the liouiville results than the one considered here . </S>",
    "<S> this is but one of the many aspects ( such as the physical meaning of the pole in the three point function ) of this problem that deserve further study . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to report on all of this soon ( some related results have appeared in @xcite ) .      </S>",
    "<S> we thank i.  runkel , i.  kostov and especially s.  ribault for several illuminating discussions . </S>",
