    "only in the magellanic clouds and the milky way galaxy can we _ directly _ measure the ages of old star clusters and thereby accurately model the history of cluster formation . in the galaxy , after decades of research into dating techniques and collecting data for halo globular clusters ( including , very recently , globulars in the far reaches of the halo using the hubble space telescope and wfpc2 ( _ e.g. _ , harris 1997 ; stetson 1999 ) ) , we are beginning to understand the details of the cluster age distribution . as this story unfolds , a next step is to compare the early formation history of the galaxy with that inferred from the same measurement techniques for star clusters in the magellanic clouds .    the most important questions to ask are ( 1 )  whether the oldest large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) clusters are as old as the oldest galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) , and ( 2 )  whether there is an age spread among the most metal - poor lmc clusters .",
    "the answer to the first question tells us about the epoch of initial cluster formation for galaxies of different mass and hubble type .",
    "the age spread among the old clusters is one tracer of the early star formation history of the galaxy , and indicates timescales important for collapsing or merging gas clouds .",
    "although the complete age distribution of the ggcs is not yet known , the evidence to date suggests that the majority of the milky way s halo clusters formed at the same time , with a small fraction of clusters that formed up to @xmath1 4 gyrs later ( stetson , vandenberg & bolte 1996 ; although see sarajedini , chaboyer & demarque 1997 for a different view ) .",
    "what fraction of the co - eval clusters formed in a single parent body or in smaller structures that later merged in not clear .",
    "the present results for the lmc also suggest a mostly co - eval population of old clusters ( brocato 1996 ; olsen 1998 ) .",
    "the first studies to attempt to measure ages for the old clusters in the lmc appeared in the mid 1980s .",
    "studies of hodge  11 ( stryker et  al .  1984 ; andersen , blecha , & walker 1984 ) , ngc  2257 ( stryker 1983 ; hesser et  al .",
    "1984 ) , and several clusters in the series of articles by walker ( referenced in walker , 1993 ) led the way in studies of these sorts .",
    "however the combination of large distance to the lmc and problems with field - star contamination made even relative age determinations with precision of a few gyr or better difficult .",
    "because of the superb resolution of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) can now be measured in the cluster cores , which substantially reduces the impact of field star contamination . with a modest effort using hst ,",
    "stars three to four magnitudes below the main - sequence turnoff can be measured with good accuracy .",
    "we have wfpc2 images in f555w and f814w of seven old lmc clusters selected to have rr lyrae stars or very blue horizontal - branch morphology ( see table 1 ) . in this paper",
    "we present color - magnitude diagrams for ngc  1466 , ngc  2257 and hodge  11 , estimate their ages relative to ggcs , and determine their blue straggler specific frequencies .",
    "all of our clusters were observed in cycle 5 .",
    "each cluster was imaged for 2 x 260s and 3 x 1000s in f555w ( @xmath1 johnson @xmath0 ) and 2 x 260s and 4 x 1000s in f814w ( @xmath1 cousins @xmath4 ) .",
    "the exposures were dithered to reduce the effect of undersampling which is aggravated by subpixel quantum - efficiency variations .",
    "for ngc  1466 , the cluster was centered on the pc . both ngc  2257 and hodge  11 were centered on wf3 .",
    "figures 1a  c show the mosaicked images of our three clusters .",

    "these calibration frames were obtained closer in time to the object frames than the ones originally used in the standard hst pipeline .",
    "we then masked the vignetted portions of the chips and corrected the pixel values for changes in effective pixel area over the chips .",
    "for the photometry , we used the allstar / allframe suite of programs which do point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting to determine magnitudes ( stetson 1987 , 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the psf varies spatially across each chip and temporally as the hst focus drifts .",
    "we created a psf by combining tiny tim ( krist 1995 ) psfs and psfs generated by daophot from our images .",
    "a daophot psf for the inner three pixels of the model psf was created for each chip using the images that had the best distribution of stars on that chip .",
    "because we lacked isolated , bright stars to determine the wings of the psf , we used the tiny tim psf beyond 3 pixels .",
    "judging by the widths of the horizontal and red giant branches and by the lack of trends of aperture correction with position , our psfs did a reasonable , although not perfect , job of mapping the spatial variations in the psf .",
    "we will return to this when discussing our fiducial lines .",
    "we set the weighting parameters `` profile error '' and `` percent error '' to zero in allstar and allframe , as suggested by cool & king ( 1995 ) .",
    "this eliminates the deviation of the pixels from the psf and errors in the flatfielding from the weighting scheme .",
    "allstar and allframe essentially did intensity - weighted aperture photometry of the inner 1.75 - 2 pixels , then added a correction for the amount of light in the wings appropriate for the psf at the star s position .",
    "in detail , for each cluster we ran find and allstar on each frame separately .",
    "next , we matched stars between frames using daomaster ( stetson 1993 ) only including stars on the master list which appeared on at least three frames .",
    "this successfully removed cosmic rays from the list .",
    "this master list was input into allframe which uses one star list for all frames , but determines magnitudes for each frame individually .",
    "thus we have five measured @xmath0 magnitudes and six @xmath4 magnitudes for most of the objects in each cluster .",
    "the allframe magnitudes required several corrections before we could calibrate the data using the transformation equations of holtzman ( 1995 ) .",
    "we first needed to correct for the difference between our psf magnitudes and apertures of 05 , which is the aperture size used by holtzman in deriving their transformation equations . to do this",
    ", we found cosmic ray hits on our images by comparing each individual image with a cosmic - ray - cleaned image created by taking the median of a registered stack of frames .",
    "pixels in each frame which deviated by more than 2@xmath20 from the value in the medianed image were flagged and the iraf task fixpix was used to interpolate over them .",
    "we next selected a set of fairly isolated stars on each frame and subtracted all other stars .",
    "stars that had more than two flagged pixels within 05 or any pixels flagged within three pixels ( @xmath1 two psf fitting radii ) of their centers were rejected . for each frame , the mean difference between the psf and 05 aperture magnitudes for the culled list of stars was determined .",
    "this value was the aperture correction and was added to all the psf magnitudes for that frame .    for the short exposures on the pc chip for ngc  2257 and hodge 11 , the difference between aperture and psf - based magnitudes was magnitude - dependent .",
    "this is due to the wfpc2 charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) problems , since there were not enough photons in the wings of the faint stars to fill up the charge traps .",
    "for these two clusters the pc has only a small fraction of the total cluster stars , so we did not use it . for ngc  1466 , the pc had a much higher background and the aperture corrections were constant with magnitude .",
    "we also note that we used sky annuli of 20 to 25 , instead of the 4and 6that holtzman used .",
    "this reduced the effects of badly subtracted neighbors in crowded regions and uneven sky brightness across the cluster face .",
    "however , there is a difference between using the closer sky apertures and the more distant ones due to contributions from the wings of the stars . based on our model psfs ,",
    "this difference is only 0.001 mags  much smaller than our errors in the aperture corrections ( see below ) .    within 05 ,",
    "most of stars were affected by residuals from subtracted neighbors and cosmic rays .",
    "the rms scatter in the aperture corrections ( aperture  psf magnitudes ) for an individual frame ranged from @xmath1 0.02 to @xmath1 0.04@xmath21mag .",
    "to see what random errors this observational scatter introduced into our zeropoints , we used daomaster to calculate the average magnitude offset for each frame among all the stars common to all frames in each filter + field combination .",
    "after accounting for the expected offset due to different exposure times , any remaining offset is a result of errors in our aperture correction .",
    "we are assuming here that the psf of wfpc2 did not change in the amount of time it took to take images of one cluster ( @xmath1 4 hours ) .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the distribution of all the offsets and found our 2@xmath20 errors to be 0.014 mags . since daomaster removes these offsets when averaging magnitudes , essentially bringing all images to the zeropoint of one frame , this is the error for our averaged magnitude zeropoints as well .",
    "we note that this error does not include any systematic error that may result if 05 apertures do not include a psf - independent fraction of the light .    after adding the aperture corrections , we corrected for the cte problem in the y - direction , using the prescription of whitmore & heyer ( 1997 ) for 05 apertures .",
    "our psfs are not good enough to allow accurate interpolation of saturated stars , so these stars were eliminated .",
    "we averaged our five f555w measurements and six f814w measurements using daomaster and kept only the stars with errors @xmath22 0.08 in both filters .",
    "finally , we calibrated the data using the holtzman equations .",
    "we list the photometry and positions for all our stars in tables 2a - c .",
    "we used the first @xmath0 exposure to determine the listed @xmath23 and @xmath24 coordinates .",
    "( tables 2a - c available from the first author )    in addition to the random errors caused by scatter in the aperture corrections ( 0.014 @xmath21mag ) , there is added uncertainty from the holtzman zero points ( @xmath1 0.03@xmath21mag ) , and from the whitmore & heyer corrections ( @xmath1 0.02@xmath21mag ) ( see stetson 1998 ) . adding these errors in quadrature leads to an overall error of 0.04 , most of it systematic , in our zeropoints .",
    "the systematic error in is more likely to to be @xmath25 , because the uncertainties in the whitmore & heyer corrections and probably in the holtzman zero points are correlated between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "each of these clusters has at least one ccd - based photometric study that we can compare with ours . our general procedure for making comparisons was to find stars in common between our study and the previous ones and eliminate all stars from the joint sample where we detected a companion within 05 in our hst images .",
    "we also exclude stars within 1 magnitude of the detection limit of the ground - based sample . in each case",
    "our calculated offsets and errors are tabulated in table 3 .",

    "olszewski ( 1991 ) derived abundances for two stars , le4 and le3 , in ngc  1466 and found that le4 had a substantially lower [ fe / h ] ( @xmath54 ) than le3 ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "we performed the same procedure using the c95 isochrones with two exceptions .",
    "first , the c95 isochrones are not @xmath69-enhanced , so we followed their recommendation and determined the appropriate solar - scaled isochrones by using the formulation of salaris , chieffi , & straniero ( 1993 ) and choosing the relative @xmath69 abundances to be @xmath116 solar .",
    "second , we found a noticeable trend in the steepness of the slope of the age-@xmath76relation depending on the metallicity of the isochrones .",

    "based on the @xmath76 ( ) method , we conclude that the lmc clusters are the same age as the ggcs to within 1.5 gyrs .",
    "the relative ages of gcs can also be calculated by using the difference in @xmath0 magnitude between the hb and the msto ( the @xmath121 method ) ( sandage 1982 ) . because luminosities can be predicted more reliably than temperatures ,",
    "this method has been often put forward as the most robust of the relative age estimators .",
    "however , it is relatively more uncertain for clusters with very blue hb morphologies such as hodge  11 for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it is difficult to assign an apparent brightness to the hb and to correct for hb - star evolution in blue - hb clusters .",
    "second , as pointed out recently by sweigart ( 1997 ) and langer , bolte & sandquist ( 1999 ) , there is reason to suspect that some blue hb stars have had helium mixed into their envelopes resulting in higher hb luminosity and , for clusters containing he - mixed stars , an artificially inflated @xmath122 value .",
    "in addition , our m 3 and m 92 data do not have many hb stars , which limits the precision of our hb magnitudes .",
    "finally , determining the magnitude of the msto is uncertain , since the color - magnitude diagram is vertical at that point .",
    "chaboyer ( 1996a ) proposed a modification that moved the lower reference point to the subgiant branch , 0.05redder than the msto color ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this reduces the errors , since the cmd cluster sequence is sloped at that point and a fiducial point can be determined with more confidence . to find @xmath120 , we used the mean magnitude of the stars in a box on the subgiant branch centered on our fiducial at @xmath123 .",
    "the box was 0.04wide in color and 0.15wide in @xmath0 .",
    "the standard error of the mean for those points within the box provides one estimate of the error , but probably underestimates it because there is additional confusion at the blue end of the sgb due to the scatter of stars from the ms to the red .",

    "the globular clusters listed in table 9 have remarkably similar .",
    "there are , of course , systematic differences among the studies in their completeness , in crowding effects and in the blue straggler definition .",
    "however , while there may be factors of up to two obscured by such problems , factors of ten are very unlikely , based on comparing studies of the same cluster with different completeness limits and crowding conditions .",
    "we have chosen mainly other hst studies to include in table 9 , which also makes the sample more homogeneous .",
    "the relatively narrow range in @xmath172 , compared to the @xmath192 range in cluster central densities , was noted by sosin & king ( 1995 ) .",
    "they argued that as the cluster density changes , different mechanisms ( _ e.g. _ , stellar collisions , tidal capture , merging of primordial binaries ) become important for the formation of blue stragglers .",
    "although the efficiency of the various mechanisms varies from cluster to cluster , the total production rate stays approximately constant .",
    "our new data strengthen this point .",
    "eridanus has a at the high end of the range and close to that of m  30 .",
    "m  30 is a post - core - collapse cluster with a central mass density log(@xmath193)= 5.26 .",
    "eridanus , on the other hand , is a sparse cluster at large galactic radius .",
    "its log(@xmath193 ) is of order 0.5 ( webbink 1985 ) .",
    "the blue straggler specific frequencies for ngc  1466 and ngc  2257 show that clusters belonging to other galaxies have the same constraints on the rate of blue straggler formation as those of the galaxy .",
    "the principle result of this study is that these three lmc clusters are the same age as m  92 and m  3 to a precision of 1.5 gyr .",
    "mighell ( 1996 ) previously reported that hodge  11 and m  92 have the same age to within 10 to 21% .",
    "testa ( 1995 ) , based on a comparison of fiducial sequences and @xmath122 values , found that ngc  2257 was about 2 gyrs younger than ngc 5897 and m  3 . in ",
    "5.4 , we found that a modified @xmath122 method gives similar ages for m  3 and ngc  2257 .",
    "part of the discrepancy lies in the smaller @xmath122 value of 3.45 we find for m  3 ( johnson & bolte 1998 ) .",
    "we note that stetson ( 1998 ) found a @xmath122 of 3.46 for m3 .",
    "their sample included the johnson & bolte stars , but was about twice as large , including having more hb stars .",
    "there are two other major studies of the ages of other old clusters in the lmc .",
    "brocato ( 1996 ) argued on the basis of @xmath122 measurements that ngc 1786 , ngc 2210 and ngc 1841 have the same age as the mean age of the ggcs , although their precision was about @xmath156 3 gyrs . olsen ( 1998 )",
    "( o98 ) found that the ages of four old lmc clusters were the same as m  5 or m  55 .",
    "one cluster , ngc 1835 , was 2 gyrs older than m  3 .",
    "depending on the age difference between m  3 and m  5 , this could mean than ngc 1835 was coeval with the other o98 clusters .",
    "another significant result from their paper was the determination of the metallicities of their clusters from the morphology of the rgb .",
    "they found metallicities about 0.2 dex higher than those found by olszewski ( 1991 ) .    before we can put all the above results together , including ours , we need to consider possible age differences between the ggc samples used to compare with the lmc ones .",
    "lee ( 1994 ) argued on the basis of hb morphology that ggcs with @xmath194 kpc are on average 2 gyrs older than those between 8 and 40 kpc .",
    "m  5 ( 6.4 kpc ) and m  55 ( 4.2 kpc ) fall into the inner group while m  3 ( 8.5 kpc ) and m  92 ( 9.1 kpc ) are members of the outer , possibly younger halo ( although note that the orbit of m  5 carries it into the outer halo ) . without resolving the issue of the chronology of ggc formation",
    ", we will discuss results for the ggcs listed above .",

    "part of this is due to observational uncertainties .",
    "our value for the hb magnitude of m  92 ( 15.18 ) is considerably fainter than the 14.96 used by chaboyer ( 1996b ) and gratton ( 1997 ) .",
    "if our value is correct , then the age gap between m  92 and the other clusters will be reduced .",
    "although uncertainties still exist , the outer halo clusters m  92 and m  3 are apparently not younger than the inner halo m  5 and m  55",
    ". we can directly compare our lmc fiducials to the inner - halo ggc m  55 , which has a metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath202 ( zw84 ) , about the same as our lmc clusters",
    ". g. mandushev kindly sent us the @xmath0 , photometry of mandushev ( 1996 ) .",
    "we choose the ngc  2257 fiducial as representative of our lmc clusters .",
    "figure 17 shows that the two cluster fiducials match very closely throughout the cmd .",
    "as is the case for the lmc@xmath165 m  92 comparison , there is at most a small , @xmath203 gyr , age difference between ngc  2257 and m  55 .",
    "the lmc has been suggested as the prototype of a source for present - day ggc .",
    "one of the scenarios advocated by searle & zinn ( 1978 ) was that clusters formed in `` fragments '' , perhaps small gas - rich irregulars , that evolved and interacted over the span of several billion years . in the particular case of the lmc , zinn ( 1980b , 1993 )",
    "has suggested that satellites like the lmc contributed their gcs to the mw halo .",
    "previous observations of the lmc clusters revealed that they are similar to the ggc in many respects ( see suntzeff 1992 ) .",
    "suntzeff pointed out that the ggc system could have been made by merging @xmath1 8 lmc - like objects .",
    "van den bergh ( 1996 ) found , on the other hand , that the metallicities of the old lmc clusters in the suntzeff sample were , on average , lower than those for clusters in the mw s outer halo .",
    "the increased metallicity estimates by o98 for five of the old lmc clusters would make this discrepancy smaller .",
    "van den bergh & morbey ( 1984 ) and others also argued that since the ellipticity of the lmc clusters is greater than in the mw clusters , it was unlikely that the mw had captured lmc clusters .",
    "the lmc clusters have a larger average ellipticity regardless of the age range considered , although at the time , accurate ages were not available .",
    "here we consider only those lmc clusters that have been confirmed as old and that have ellipticity measurements by frenk & fall ( 1982 ) and those mw clusters that are not heavily reddened ( e()@xmath204 ) ( harris 1992 ) . a two - sided k - s test can reject only at the 77% level the hyphothesis that these two groups were drawn from the same distribution .",
    "goodwin ( 1997 ) notes that cluster ellipticity can depend more strongly on the tidal field of the parent galaxy than it does on intrinsic cluster properties . for the specific case of the three lmc clusters considered here ,",
    "each of them has a small eccentricity , consistent with the distribution seen in the ggcs .",
    "another similarity between the old clusters of the galaxy and lmc is in the distribution of hb morphology with [ fe / h ] . in the outer halo of the galaxy ,",
    "the hb morphology of ggcs is on average too red for the cluster metallicity ( the `` young halo '' of lee 1994 ) .",
    "zinn ( 1993 ) showed that the best match to the outer halo ggc properties in terms of [ fe / h ] and hb morphology were the clusters of the lmc and smc .",
    "( in fact , the smc globular ngc 121 was the first `` second parameter '' globular cluster noticed ( van den bergh 1967 ) ) .",
    "he suggested that the majority of the inner halo clusters formed in the overall collapse of the galaxy , but that the outer halo was mostly accreted from relatively large satellites .",
    "the new @xmath155 results allow us to make a few comments about the scenario in which lmc - like galaxies are absorbed by the galaxy and contribute their stars to the galactic halo .",
    "on the basis of age , the _ old _ lmc clusters would be indistinguishable from existing ggcs , at least our comparison clusters in the intermediate halo . with the recent age estimates and , for the o98 clusters , revisions in [ fe / h ] estimates , it is also possible to improve on the [ fe / h ]  hb morphology comparison between the lmc clusters and different ggc populations . in figure 18",
    ", we plot our version of hb - type versus [ fe / h ] originally shown in lee ( 1990 ) .",
    "the o98 clusters at their revised metallicities show nice agreement with the inner halo clusters of the galaxy , while our clusters fall among the outer halo clusters , as originally noted by zinn ( 1993 ) . since the o98 clusters were not well - studied before hst and had no hb - type , they were not included in the analysis of zinn ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , with the new data , we can see that if the lmc contributes all of its gcs to the mw halo , it will contribute clusters like those in the inner halo as well , in about equal proportions .",
    "there is another interesting , though tentative point .",
    "if we accept the o98 metallicities , then , as is the case for the ggc , the lmc clusters also separate into two groups in the hb - type versus [ fe / h ] plot .",
    "one group , composed of the o98 clusters , has higher [ fe / h ] s but not redder hbs than the other , which includes all the clusters studied by walker ( 1992b ) , including ngc  1466 , ngc  2257 and hodge  11 .",
    "the lmc groups also mimic the ggc in their spatial distribution differences .",
    "the o98 clusters are concentrated toward the center of the lmc .",
    "they all have projected angular separations @xmath22 2.5from the lmc center , whereas the walker sample has no clusters closer than 2.5from the center .",
    "based on our analysis in  6.2.1 , where we discussed the age range among all the lmc clusters studied with hst , it is possible that age in this case in not the second parameter , a point also made by da costa ( 1999 ) .",
    "a picture where the lmc builds up its outer gcs by accreting satellites is also less appealing , because of the mass of the lmc is not much larger than the the mass of the smallest satellites known to have their own globular cluster systems .",
    "an additional clue to the formation of the lmc cluster system comes from the possible radial abundance gradient , if the o98 metallicities are correct ( da costa 1999 ) .",
    "our most fundamental result is that the oldest lmc clusters are the same age as the old ggc .",
    "what does this mean for our understanding of galaxy formation ?",
    "on one extreme , if we imagine the galaxy being made completely via the accumulation of lmc - sized fragments ( and if we accept the argument of stetson ( 1996 ) that most ggc are essentially coeval ) , then this coincidence in age would be telling us that the collapse epoch of all the original fragments was the same to 1.5 gyr or so .",
    "in the opposite extreme , in which only a small fraction of the current - day galaxy was acquired through accumulation of small companions , our result is then telling us that the formation epoch for the milky way out to the intermediate halo is the same to @xmath205 gyr as for the lmc , a galaxy ten times less massive .",
    "we discuss briefly here this result in the context of one ( popular ) galaxy formation scenario  hierarchical clustering ( _ e.g. _ , blumenthal 1984 ) .",
    "it is not yet possible to fully simulate the processes that lead to galaxy formation . in particular",
    ", the question of when globular clusters form within hierarchical clustering models is not yet accessible to simulations . nevertheless , with the reasonable assumptions that globular clusters were formed within larger structures ( e.g. a proto - lmc ) and were among the first objects formed after the gas began to collapse , we can investigate whether the current hierarchical formation models can be consistent with our `` fossil record '' data .",
    "we note that as the models become more complete and sophisticated , this discussion may become rapidly dated . nevertheless ,",
    "as the data for globular cluster ages continue to improve , they will become increasingly important in testing models such as these .",
    "as an example of what hierarchical clustering models predict for the formation epoch of lmc - like galaxies , we examined the properties of galaxies in 100 `` milky way '' halos calculated by the semi - analytic method of somerville & kolatt ( 1999 ) and someville & primack ( 1999 ) .",
    "these semi - analytic models are a powerful way to study galaxy formation by combining merging histories for dark - matter halos based on extended press - schechter theory ( bower 1991 ; bond 1991 ) with simple prescriptions for such physical processes as gas cooling , star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "the advantage of using this method is that the formation and evolution of many systems in many different cosmologies can be calculated in a reasonable period of time .",
    "placing gc formation in this scenario is difficult , because there is no agreed - on model of globular cluster formation and these models are not hydrodynamical calculations that can probe globular cluster formation .",
    "however , since the globular clusters are slightly metal - enriched and since models of globular cluster formation generally start with cold molecular gas ( _ e.g. _ , harris and pudritz 1994 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , we can place the epoch of formation just after the gas can cool and start to form stars .",
    "when this happens depends on the mass of the dark matter halo . because of the meta - galactic uv field , gas is prevented from cooling until its dark matter halo has reached the critical mass when its gas is dense enough to be self - shielded from ionizing photons .",
    "simulations have shown that while this critical mass depends on redshift , it is not sensitive to such details as the shape of the uv - spectrum and the inclusion of star formation , especially at the level of precision we require ( _ e.g. _ , weinberg , hernquist & katz 1997 ) .    for each present - day galaxy in our `` milky way '' halo catalog , we have the redshift ( @xmath206 ) when any of the halos in that particular galaxy s merging tree reached that critical mass in dark matter ( the `` first progenitor '' ) .",
    "we assume that this marks the initial stage of globular cluster formation .",
    "we confine our results here to those satellites with @xmath207 , which includes the lmc and smc , but not the dwarf spheroidals .    to illustrate the range of separation in time of this epoch , we calculated the difference in @xmath206 between the milky - way type galaxy and each of its satellites in the 100 model halos .",
    "the results are plotted in figures 19a - b for two different cosmologies , standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) with @xmath208=1.0 and @xmath209=50 km s@xmath210 mpc@xmath210 and cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath211cdm ) with @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath209=70 km s@xmath210 mpc@xmath210 . while there is a tail to large age differences , there is a strong peak at small age differences in both cosmologies .",
    "we can not measure age differences much smaller than 1 gyr .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the initial epoch of globular cluster formation in a galaxy happened at about the same time as the collapse of the first progenitor of that galaxy , then our result that the oldest lmc and the galactic clusters formed at the same time @xmath156 1.5 gyr is completely consistent with current hierarchical clustering models . as harris ( 1997 ) pointed out , this apparent synchronicity between the lmc and galaxy , and within the outer halo of the galaxy , is due to a number of _ individual _ dark matter halos approximately simultaneously reaching a critical mass so that star formation can start .",
    "the smc provides a counter - example as it apparently began its cluster formation @xmath1 2 gyr later ( _ e.g. _ , stryker , da costa , & mould 1985 ; mighell , sarajedini , & french 1998 ) . in our hierarchial clustering models , it would be in the tail of the `` milky way''-satellite age distribution .    we conclude that hierarchial clustering models , at least as described by current semi - analytical codes , are consistent with both constraints mentioned at the beginning of this section , though it is slightly harder to satisfy the first constraint for a @xmath211cdm case .",
    "while many lmc - size galaxies form at about the same time , there is dispersion in @xmath206 , making it less likely to have all the original fragments collapse at the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass difference between the milky way and the lmc is not enough for it to be unusual for the collapse of the first progenitor to happen at the same time for both galaxies .",
