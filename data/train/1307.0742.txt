    "we are interested in producing estimates from a sequence of probability distributions .",
    "the aim is to quickly report these estimates with a user - specified bound on the monte carlo error .",
    "we assume that it is possible to use mcmc methods to draw samples from the target distributions .",
    "for example , the sequence can be the posterior distributions of parameters from a bayesian model as additional data becomes available , with the aim of reporting the posterior means with the variance of the monte carlo error being less than @xmath0 .",
    "we present a general system that addresses this problem .",
    "our system involves saving the samples produced from the mcmc sampler in a database .",
    "the samples are updated each time there is a change of sample space .",
    "the update involves weighting or transiting the samples , depending on whether the space sample changes or not . in order to control the accuracy of the estimates ,",
    "the samples in the database are maintained .",
    "this maintenance involves increasing or decreasing the number of samples in the database .",
    "this maintenance also involves monitoring the quality of the samples using their effective sample size .",
    "see table [ tab : control_variates ] for a summary of the control variables .",
    "another feature of our system is that the mcmc sampler is paused whenever the estimate is accurate enough .",
    "the mcmc sampler can later be resumed if a more accurate estimate is required .",
    "therefore , it may be the case that no new samples are generated for some targets .",
    "hence the system is efficient , as it reuses samples and only generates new samples when necessary .",
    "our approach has similar steps to those used in sequential monte carlo ( smc ) methods @xcite , such as an update ( or transition ) step and re - weighting of the samples . despite the similarities , smc methods are unable to achieve the desired aims considered in this paper .",
    "specifically , even though smc methods are able to produce estimates from a sequence of distributions , it is unclear how to control the accuracy of this estimate without restarting the whole procedure .",
    "for example , consider the simulations in @xcite where the bootstrap particle filter , a particular smc method , is introduced . in these simulations",
    "the posterior mean is reported with the interval between @xmath1 and @xmath2 percentile points .",
    "as these percentile points are fixed , there is no way to reduce the length of the interval .",
    "the only hope of reducing the interval is to rerun the particle filter with more particles , although there is no guarantee .",
    "this conflicts with the aim of reporting the estimates quickly . in practice ,",
    "most smc methods are concerned with models where only one observation is revealed at a time ( see simulations in e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our framework allows for observations to be revealed in batches of varying sizes ; see the application presented in  [ sec : football ] .",
