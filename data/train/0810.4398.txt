    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is its response to rotation .",
    "as was first understood in the context of superfluid helium-4@xcite , a bose - einstein condensate does not rotate in the manner of a conventional fluid , which undergoes rigid body rotation .",

    "it focuses mainly on situations in which there are large vortex arrays in a regime of rapid rotation , and on the theoretical predictions of the novel phases that can appear in this regime .",

    "the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath13 , is much larger than the typical range of the inter - atomic potential .",
    "the two - particle scattering is therefore dominated by @xmath14-wave scattering , with a scattering length @xmath15 that is typically of order a few nanometres ( for @xmath16rb , @xmath17 ) .",

    "that said , inter - atomic interactions are still present and are important for many physical properties .",
    "non - zero repulsive interactions will cause the gas to behave as a superfluid , with non - zero critical velocity@xcite .",

    "[ fig : slice ] @xcite .",
    "this can lead to a significant increase in the interaction energy scale@xcite .",
    "it is important that the subband confinement retains rotational symmetry , to prevent loss of angular momentum or heating ( see below ) .",
    "* increase @xmath71 .",
    "a tighter harmonic confinement would allow an increased vortex density and hence stronger interactions at @xmath682 .",
    "much tighter traps can be formed by using atom chip traps formed on surface microstructures@xcite , allowing transverse trapping frequencies on the order of @xmath691 .",
    "( such systems are highly anisotropic , @xmath139 , so could potentially be used to study the 3d lll regime ( [ eq : q3dregime ] ) . )",
    "very tight confinement can also be achieved in the wells of an optical lattice .",

    "there are interesting proposals@xcite for how clusters of small numbers of particles might be transferred adiabatically from a non - rotating state into the strongly correlated laughlin state . * optical lattice systems .",
    "the energy scales that set the correlation energies in optical lattices are large .",
    "physical rotation of the optical lattice@xcite involves the same centrifugal limit ( [ eq : centrifugal ] ) , again limiting the vortex density to the values leading to ( [ eq : interactionscale ] ) .",
    "this method will therefore likely also need to be supplemented with tight harmonic confinement in order to achieve a large interaction energy at @xmath682 .",
    "however , the proposed schemes for imprinting peierls phases onto the inter - site tunnelling matrix elements@xcite appear to allow field configurations that mimic uniform rotation without a centrifugal limit .",
    "if flux densities of order one flux per site can be generated , these systems could show strongly correlated states with a large energy scale ( see  [ sec : lattices ] ) .    _ heating _    an atomic gas that has come to equilibrium at a rotation rate @xmath56 is at rest in the rotating frame of reference . for example , in the vortex lattice phase the positions of the vortices are at rest in the rotating frame . in the laboratory frame ,",

    "it is instructive to estimate the importance of such excitations on an incompressible liquid state , by applying a form of landau criterion . for an incompressible liquid state ,",

    "the edge of a rotating cloud of radius @xmath700 moves with a linear velocity of @xmath701 , which is close to @xmath702 for a system with a large number of vortices ( [ eq : close ] ) . due to this motion , in this edge region the collective modes with wavevectors @xmath703 have negative energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "these excitations can therefore be spontaneously generated by any perturbation that is static in the laboratory frame and has fourier components on the relevant scale , @xmath704 .",
    "this sets a strict requirement on the potential : any static perturbation in the laboratory frame that has a wavelength less than of order the radius of the cloud can efficiently generate collective modes the rotating gas ( i.e. cause heating ) .",
    "the use of geometric phases to simulate rotation ( or a uniform magnetic field )  either in a lattice - based system@xcite or in the continuum@xcite  has the advantage that the gas remains at rest in the laboratory frame .",
    "this removes the relative motion of the gas with respect to possible perturbations at rest in the laboratory frame , and eliminates these as sources of heating .",
    "experimental work has recently introduced a vector potential@xcite of vanishing curl using two - photon induced geometric phases , setting the stage for extensions to vector potentials with non - zero curl .",
    "rapidly rotating degenerate atomic gases offer the possibility to explore the physics of quantized vortices and vortex lattices in novel parameter regimes .",
    "this review has described some of the novel equilibrium properties that can appear : for rotating spinless and multi - component bose gases ; for bose gases on rotating lattices ; and for rotating fermi gases .",
    "interesting new physics can emerge both within the realm where mean - field theories are applicable ( as is dramatically illustrated by the novel vortex lattice phases in figs .  [ fig : dipolargs ] , [ fig : muellerho ] and [ fig : reijnderss1 ] ) , and within regimes where mean - field theory fails ( as evidenced by the theoretical predictions of some very exotic strongly correlated phases ) .",
    "while theoretical studies have helped to clarify some of the expected properties of these systems , our understanding is still very much limited .",
    "it is hoped that these theoretical predictions will motivate and inform future experimental investigations of these novel phenomena . at the very least ,",
    "these theoretical studies show that very interesting aspects of many - body quantum physics are at play in rotating degenerate atomic gases ; this is an area where future theory and experiment are likely to uncover dramatic new phenomena .",

    "within the space of 2d lll states , any two - body interaction that is rotationally symmetric in the 2d plane can be conveniently parameterized by its `` haldane pseudo - potentials''@xcite .",
    "owing to the rotational symmetry , the interaction conserves the relative angular momentum of two particles .",
    "thus , its effects are determined by the expectation value of the two - body potential in the two - particle wavefunction @xmath705 where @xmath89 and @xmath706 are the relative and centre - of - mass angular momenta . for spinless bosonic ( fermionic ) particles , @xmath89 must be even ( odd ) so only the subset of even ( odd ) haldane pseudo - potentials of the interaction are important . for contact interactions ( [ eq : contact ] ) , the only non - zero pseudo - potential is v_0 = d^3 e^-2(x^2+y^2)/a_^2 e^-2z^2/a_^2 = .",

    "interactions lift this degeneracy and select a groundstate .",
    "to understand the properties of the groundstate ( and the low - lying excitations ) it has proved very useful to make use of exact diagonalization studies .",

    "this makes exact diagonalization feasible for systems that can be large enough to observe clear signatures of strongly correlated many - particle states .",
    "numerical studies have been performed in several different geometries , described in detail below . in each case , the strategy is the use of the `` configuration interaction '' method :    * one chooses a finite number of ( orthonormal ) single particle basis states , @xmath712 , with @xmath713 which span the 2d lll for the geometry considered .",

    "the number of basis states can be reduced by the use of symmetries , which depend on the geometry ( see below ) .",

[ eq : shift ] the offset @xmath722 is referred to as the `` shift '' , which is a characteristic of a given incompressible liquid phase@xcite . owing to this offset ( [ eq : shift ] ) , different competing incompressible liquid states at a given filling factor can be studied independently on the sphere if they have different shifts .",
    "this is an advantage if the shift of the groundstate is known : consistent extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit along a sequence with that shift is strong evidence for this phase describing the thermodynamic limit .",
