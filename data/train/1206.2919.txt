    "the advancement of discovery in astronomy , from the statistical point of view , can be described as the successful application of several distinct knowledge discovery ( kd ) techniques to increasingly larger data samples .",
    "these techniques include : the classification of sources according to one or more observational quantities ; pattern recognition for the discovery of correlations among observable quantities ; outlier selection for highlighting rare and/or unknown sources ; regression , for the estimation of derived empirical properties from observed quantities .",
    "the discovery of new or unexpected correlations between observable quantities at different wavelengths , for example , has propelled the understanding of the nature of astronomical sources and their physical modeling ( see , for example , the discovery of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies  @xcite ) , and the discovery of the link of the galaxy x - ray emission with different stellar populations  @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of pattern recognition techniques for the determination of correlations in low dimensional spaces ( two or three dimensions ) has usually relied on the ability of the astronomers to visualize the distribution of data and make informed guesses about the nature of these patterns , based on theoretical models , reasonableness and intuition . however",
    ", this approach becomes more and more ineffectual with the increase in complexity and size of the explored datasets .",
    "this difficulty has led to the introduction of kd techniques in the astronomical context .",
    "such techniques are based on statistical and computational methodologies capable of automatically identifying useful correlations among parameters in a n - dimensional dataset without any _ a priori _ assumption on the nature of both data and the sought out patterns . using these techniques , the focus of the astronomer can shift to the definition of the general problem to be investigated , the selection of the interesting patterns and their physical interpretation . in this paper , we present clasps , a new methodology based on kd techniques for the exploration of complex and massive astronomical datasets and the detection of correlations among observational parameters . while clasps is designed for datasets containing very large number of sources ,",
    "it is also well suited to handle small datasets , as will be shown in this paper .",
    "the adoption of kd methodologies in astronomy has only recently surged , due to the increasing availability of massive and complex datasets that would be almost intractable if tackled with the knowledge extractions techniques classically employed in astronomical research .",
    "a review of the advantages and most interesting applications of kd to astronomical problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for the delay in the adoption of such methods in astronomy are : a ) datasets for which kd has an edge over classical methods ( because of their size and complexity ) have become frequent only in the last @xmath215 years ; b ) slow transition from model - driven to data - driven research ; c ) lack of interdisciplinary expertise required for the application of kd techniques .",
    "other disciplines for which the problem of dealing with massive datasets arose earlier , instead , have seen a steadier and faster growth of the number and importance of the kd tools employed on a regular basis .",
    "for example , the study of financial markets and complex networks and systems ( applied to the www , advertisement placement , epidemiology , genetics , proteomics and security ) have been on the forefront of application and development of kd techniques .",
    "thorough reviews of the applications of kd methodologies to specific financial topics , i.e. customer management and financial fraud detection , can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively , while a general review of the role of kd in bio - informatics is provided in  @xcite . even if a certain degree of inter - disciplinary expertise is desired , domain - specific knowhow is crucial to narrow down the types and number of techniques that can be used to address the specific problems encountered in each field , and to interpret correctly the results of the application of such techniques to the data .",
    "furthermore , kd is only one of the skills necessary to tackle the new problems arising with the onset of data - driven astronomy , the other being astrostatistics  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , visualization techniques  @xcite and advanced signal processing  @xcite .",
    "all these fields are currently the subject of a new discipline : the astroinformatics  @xcite .    in this paper , we have focused our attention on the broad question of how efficiently the physical nature of astronomical sources can be characterized by multi - wavelength photometric data .",
    "we have applied clasps to two datasets representing specific cases where such assumption can be tested and verified .",
    "clasps assumes that low dimensional patterns in data are associated with aggregations ( clusters ) in the structure of the data in the high - dimensional ",
    "_ feature _ space \" generated by all the observables of the source .",
    "these clusters are defined by the degree of correlation between the distribution of _ features _",
    "( i.e. , the observables used to build the _ feature _ space where clusters have been selected ) and a set of external quantities , usually observables , metadata or _ a priori _ constraints that have not been used for clustering .",
    "the clasps method , based on the kd techniques for unsupervised clustering and the use of external information to label the clusters members , has been designed to tackle the problem of the extraction of information from two distinct classes of datasets : a ) inhomogeneous large area datasets .",
    "the advancements in the virtual observatory ( vo ) technology are facilitating the access to datasets obtained by the combination of multiple observations from different surveys with different observational features ( e.g. , depth , spatial coverage and resolution , spectral resolution ) .",
    "such datasets are , by construction , inherently incomplete and are affected by the inconsistency of the observational features of each set of observations used to create them .",
    "we expect these datasets to grow in complexity as new data becomes available .",
    "kd techniques can facilitate the extraction of the available knowledge contained in these  federated \" inhomogeneous samples .",
    "b ) large homogeneous datasets from multi - wavelength surveys of well - defined areas of the sky observed with similar depths at different wavelengths .",
    "these surveys typically yield large samples of sources , complete to a given flux .",
    "these datasets span limited but well characterized regions of the n - dimensional observable _ feature _ space .",
    "the exploration of the structure of the multi - dimensional distribution of sources in the _ feature _ space may lead to the discovery of high dimensional correlations and patterns in the data that have been overlooked ( or , simply , could not be established ) in lower dimensional studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe the clasps method , in sec .  [ sec : experiment1 ] its application to the csc+ dataset , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment2 ] its application to a sample of blazars with multi - wavelength photometry available .",
    "we discuss the future developments of clasps in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "clasps is based on well established data mining techniques for unsupervised clustering .",
    "these techniques search for spontaneous and inherent aggregations of data in the _ feature _ space generated by their observables .",
    "table  [ tab : definitions ] summarizes the terms that will be used below .",
    "these techniques have been complemented by the use of external data ( _ labels _ ) .",
    "_ labels _ are observables not used for the clustering which can be used to characterize the content of the set of clusters or of single clusters .",
    "@xcite used these techniques for the selection of optical candidate quasars from photometric datasets .",
    "they employ as _ label _ the spectroscopic classification available for a subset of the photometric sources .",
    "this method can be extended to use multiple _ labels _ , both numerical ( e.g. , fluxes , magnitudes , colors ) and categorial ( spectral classification flags , morphological types ) . from a methodological standpoint ,",
    "the two tools required for this kd methodology are :    1 .",
    "one or more unsupervised clustering algorithms , to determine multiple sets of partitions of the data .",
    "( the specific methods used in this paper are discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : clustering ] ) ; 2 .",
    "a quantitative measure of the degree of correlation between cluster populations and the values of the _ label _ associated with the members of the clusters ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : scores ] for more details ) ;    once multiple clusterings of a dataset in a given _ feature _ space have been produced , the choice of the most interesting partition of the dataset is performed considering a quantitative evaluation of the degree of correlation between the distribution of the _ label _ and the cluster population in each clustering .",
    "unlike most classical criteria selection that rely only on the intrinsic statistical properties of the clusterings , our method selects clusterings based on both the distributions of _ features _ and of the associated _ labels_. the degree of correlation between _ features _ and _ labels _ can be generically expressed by a numerical quantity ( the  score \" , see sec .",

    "in this paper we have presented clasps , a new method for the determination of correlations in complex astronomical datasets , based on kd techniques for unsupervised clustering supplemented by the use of external information to label and characterize the content of the clusters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the _ score _ ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : scores ] ) and shown the reliability of the _ score _ as a measure of the degree of correlation among the membership distribution of sources in a clustering and the distribution of a quantitative or categorial _ label _ in distinct classes , using simulated clusterings ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : choice ] ) .",
    "we have also discussed the applications of clasps to two different samples composed of extragalactic sources with multi - wavelength photometry used as _ features _ : the first dataset , csc+ ( sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment1 ] ) , is composed of spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the sdss dr8 with multi - wavelength observations in the near - infrared , optical and ultraviolet , and detected ( or with reliable upper limits ) in the chandra x - ray csc catalog ; the second dataset ( sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment2 ] ) is composed of optically confirmed blazars with mid - infrared , near - infrared and optical observations , complemented , for a subset of the sources , by @xmath1-ray data from the 2fgl .    the main result of the application of clasps to the csc+ dataset has been the confirmation of a well known correlation  ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between the near - ultraviolet / blue optical luminosity of optically selected radio - quiet quasars and the spectral index @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : application1 ] ) in a subset of the highly inhomogeneous csc+ sample .",
    "clasps has narrowed the csc+ sample to three specific clusters that show significant correlation between the @xmath3 mono - chromatic luminosity and the @xmath0 spectral index , based on the clustering of the csc+ sample in the _ feature _ space generated by the near - infrared , optical and ultraviolet photometric data .",
    "further analysis of the results have shown that the correlation for the subset of sources contained in the correlated clusters is driven by the values of the @xmath4 color , as an indicator of the presence of the  big - blue - bump \" component in the seds of the sources .    in the case of the experiments performed on the blazars sample , clasps has revealed an unknown correlations between the spectral classification of the blazars in bzqs , bzbs and bzus ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : dataset2 ] ) and their distribution in the _ feature _ space generated by mid - infrared , near - infrared and optical colors .",
    "further investigation has shown that the correlation is almost entirely attributable to the peculiar pattern followed by bzcat and @xmath1-ray detected blazars follow in the wise mid - infrared color space ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : application2 ] ) .",
    "the implications of this pattern on the modeling of blazars emission mechanism and a novel method for the selection of candidate blazars from mid - infrared survey photometric data based on such pattern have been investigated in other works by some of the authors  @xcite .",
    "while in this paper we have described applications of clasps to inhomogeneous samples obtained by federating data from general purpose large area surveys , we plan to apply the method to large homogeneous samples of extragalactic sources , like the chandra-_cosmos _ dataset  @xcite .",
    "clasps selects the optimal clustering based on the _ scores _ , a measure of the correlation between the clustering membership and a given partition of one external observable used as _ label_. for this reason , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : comparison ] , clasps differentiate itself from `` cluster ensembles '' techniques .",
    "nonetheless , three different aspects of the current clasps method could be improved by the application of cluster ensembles techniques : 1 ) the limited number of clustering techniques used may bias the exploration of the clusterings towards particular aspects of the _ feature _ distribution of the dataset considered . moreover , clasps does not to take into account the properties and , potentially , weaknesses of each distinct clustering techniques ; 2 ) the choice of the optimal clustering is based on a single _ label _ at the time .",
    "correlations between a given set of clusterings and multiple _ labels _ can not be captured by clasps , but are left to the interpretation of multiple distinct _",
    "experiments ; 3 ) the choice of the optimal clusterings in clasps is based on a single  view \" of the dataset , i.e. on clusterings obtained using a single set of sources and/or _",
    "features_.    the first point could be easily addressed by widening the portfolio of clustering methods used by clasps .",
    "then , cluster ensembles methods could be applied to subsets of clusterings ( grouped by total number of clusters or by type of clustering method ) to determine the `` consensus clustering '' of each subset of clusterings .",
    "the _ scores _ would then be evaluated on the set of consensus clusterings determined in this way .",
    "the second point could be similarly addressed by searching for the `` consensus clusterings '' of the set of optimal clusterings selected through the _ scores _",
    "values for different _",
    "labels_.    the third point is particularly important for astronomy , because most astronomical datasets present different number of _ features _ available for different members of the dataset . in its current implementation",
    ", clasps can be applied only to clusterings obtained with a fixed given subset of sources and _ features_. clasps , in this scenario , can be applied separately to distinct groups of sources in the dataset with a set of common _ features_. in order to overcome this limitation , distinct sets of clusterings could be obtained for different `` views '' of the dataset , i.e. different subsets of the datasets with the same set of _ features _ available .",
    "then , the multiple clusterings obtained with on the different views of the dataset with different clustering techniques could be consolidated into a single set of clusterings through the application of cluster ensembles technique on the groups of clustering obtained with the same clustering technique on distinct views of the dataset .",
    "this approach is similar to `` _ _ features _ _ distributed clustering '' and ",
    "object distributed clustering \" scenarios typical of practical application of clustering ensemble @xcite .    a further improvement to the clasps method",
    "is related to the choice of the classes of the _ labels_. in the frequent case of quantitative continuous _",
    "labels _ , the choice of the binning is crucial for the evaluation of the _ scores _ and , in turn , for the determination of the correlations among _ features _ and _ labels _ , if any . while the astronomer deciding the binning of the _ labels _ on the basis of _",
    "a priori _ knowledge of the specific topic considered is a viable option for most cases where the astronomer tries to generalize an already known correlation or a generic problem ( e.g. the characterization of astronomical sources based on their photometric parameters for this paper ) is investigated , this can be a limitation to the generality of the method when the aim of the experiments is a  blind \" exploration of multi - dimensional astronomical datasets . in order to improve this aspect of the clasps method",
    ", we are exploring the possibility of complementing the astronomer s definition of classes of _ labels _ with spontaneous classes that can be determined from the intrinsic distribution of the _ labels _ themselves by the application of non - parametric kd techniques .",
