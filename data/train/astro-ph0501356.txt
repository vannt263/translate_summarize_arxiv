    "precision radial velocity surveys of nearby fgkm stars show that at least 6% of them harbor giant planets @xcite , with that fraction rising rapidly for metal - rich stars @xcite . in the most popular models for planet formation @xcite ,",
    "the same metal - rich conditions which hasten the growth of giant planet cores also promote the formation of terrestrial planets at smaller orbital radii .",
    "naively , therefore , one expects that stars hosting giant planets ought to be promising locations for finding terrestrial planets , although the converse need not be true @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is not immediately challenged by the existence of short - period and eccentric giant extrasolar planets , since orbit integrations have shown that the orbital radii and eccentricities of giant extrasolar planets do not normally preclude the existence of stable terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "indeed , the majority of systems allow dynamically stable habitable terrestrial planets as defined by @xcite , although formation calculations show that the final masses and orbital radii of terrestrial planets are likely to vary depending on the configuration of the giant planets @xcite",
    ". in some circumstances , terrestrial planets  or the building blocks thereof may even survive giant planet migration @xcite .    in this letter , we investigate whether the _ early _ evolution of multiple giant planets in extrasolar planetary systems could be more restrictive of terrestrial planet formation than the relatively benign dynamical environment that exists today .",
    "the typical extrasolar planet with a semi - major axis of a few au has an eccentric orbit @xcite , most likely as a consequence of either planet - disk interactions @xcite or gravitational scattering in multiple planet systems @xcite .",
    "although both mechanisms are theoretically plausible , to date only the scattering hypothesis has been demonstrated to provide a quantitative match to the distribution of extrasolar planet eccentricities @xcite .",
    "here , we assume that scattering is the origin of the eccentricity of extrasolar planets , and study the influence of such scattering on orbits within the terrestrial planet zone ( a related study was performed by thommes , duncan & levison 1999 , who discussed the impact of outward migration of uranus and neptune on the kuiper belt ) .",
    "the initial conditions for our scattering experiments are described in  2 . in  3 ,",
    "we describe our main result - that the early dynamical evolution expected within an unstable multiple planet system acts to clear out a large fraction of the mass that would otherwise be available to form terrestrial planets at smaller radius .",
    "we suggest in  4 that this effect might be strong enough to produce an anti - correlation between the presence - in the same system - of eccentric massive planets at a few au and terrestrial planets .",
    "for our initial conditions , we assume that several massive planets have formed from the protoplanetary disk in a configuration that is stable over short time scales ( of the order of the gas dissipation time scale , which is approximately @xmath1  yr ) , but unstable over longer time scales . depending upon",
    "exactly how multiple giant planets typically form , such a gas - free interim state may or may not exist . ignoring not only any residual gas , but also dynamical friction from planetesimal swarms @xcite , we study the coupled evolution of the massive planets together with a population of terrestrial planet cores at smaller orbital radii .",
    "we justify our neglect of dynamical friction by noting that the jovian planets are substantially more massive than the surviving solid bodies in the vicinity . at the time when the gas disk is dissipated ,",
    "several tens of such cores  which for our purposes can be treated as massless test particles  are likely to exist ( kominami & ida 2002 , 2004 ) and be concentrated in the habitable zone @xcite .",
    "eccentric massive planets can result from dynamical evolution in two planet @xcite , three planet @xcite , or initially more crowded systems @xcite . which of these ( if any ) is physically most appropriate as an initial condition is unknown .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt an initial state with three giant planets , as this is the simplest system that yields instability on the desired time scales without considerable fine tuning of the initial planetary separations .    using rauch & hamilton s ( 2004 , in preparation ) hnbody bulirsch - stoer integrator , which is designed for the integration of n - body systems with a single massive object , we performed @xmath2 integrations .",
    "each integration modeled the evolution of @xmath3 jovian - mass planets and @xmath4 test particles in the terrestrial planet region around a solar - mass star over @xmath5 myr .",
    "the jovian - mass planets acted on the terrestrial ones , but not vice versa . in each simulation , all planets were started on circular , almost coplanar orbits , with randomly assigned angular variables and randomly assigned inclination values less than @xmath6 . at time intervals of @xmath7 yr , if the periapse of a test particle was smaller than one solar radii , we considered that test particle to have collided with the star .",
    "the semimajor axes of the test particles were evenly distributed from @xmath8 au to @xmath9 au . for the massive planets",
    ", we fixed @xmath10  au and @xmath11  au , and varied @xmath12 in order to sample the range of possible behavior . for six cases",
    "@xmath13 , we set @xmath14  au .",
    "case @xmath2 is a repeat of case @xmath15 except with different random choices of the angular variables and inclinations . with this setup , in all but one case , energy and angular momentum errors , expressed by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the initial system energy and angular momentum , did not exceed @xmath20 .",
    "the motivation for our choice of initial giant planet separations was the desire to study systems which have dynamically settled into a state resembling known multi - planet exosystem configurations - configurations featuring two well - separated eccentric giant planets . by targeting the final location of such an eccentric giant planet in the semimajor axis range , @xmath21 au",
    ", we found through preliminary tests that the initial semimajor axis of the innermost planet should exceed @xmath22 au . in order to produce the instability needed to eject one giant planet on timescales exceeding several orbits but less than several million years , we set the ratio @xmath23 between 1.20 and 1.22 , just within the globally chaotic limit established by @xcite for two - planet systems .",
    "our choice of @xmath24 was arbitrary , but did prove through experimentation to yield the types of systems we sought to investigate .",
    "the final orbital parameters of the giant planets in each of the seven systems simulated are summarized in table 1 .",
    "asterisks denote a giant planet that was ejected from the system ; in 5 of the 7 simulations , one planet was ejected .",
    "the final states of these 5 systems are broadly similar ",
    "one planet settled into an orbit with a semimajor axis of between @xmath5 au - @xmath3 au , while the other achieved an orbit with @xmath25 au .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the orbital parameters for the three planets in case @xmath26 .",
    "one observes that the outer planet interacts significantly with the middle planet after @xmath27 myr , is then shoved outward beyond @xmath4 au at about @xmath28 myr , and finally is ejected from the system right before @xmath5 myr has elapsed .",
    "the middle planet settles into an orbit of @xmath29 au and the inner planet settles with @xmath30 au . from table 1",
    ", one sees that the middle planet s orbit was nearly circularized after @xmath5 myr , while the inner planet , whose semimajor axis varied by no more than a few au throughout the simulation , attained a significant eccentricity of over @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution seen here is representative of the typically complex interactions that occur in a multiple planet system prior to ejection , although it can not be emphasized too much that the system is chaotic and that several qualitatively different outcomes are possible .",
    "further , the systems in table 1 do not appear to have settled down ; more dynamical evolution is likely , some of it violent .",
    "a comparison of case 6 and case 7 illustrates explicitly how different outcomes can arise even though the same initial semimajor axis and eccentricity values were used in both cases .",
    "figure 2 displays the fraction of the 50 test particles , all initially residing within a loosely defined habitable zone of @xmath32 au , that survived the @xmath5 myr - long shuffling of the three giant planets .",
    "triangles show the fraction of test particles that survived _ and _ still reside in the habitable zone ; diamonds the total fraction that survived with semimajor axes @xmath33 au .",
    "the solid line is the average value ( 1% ) of the triangles , and the dotted line is the average value ( 14% ) of the diamonds .",
    "all of the test particles that survive outside the habitable zone are propelled outward beyond @xmath9 au rather than inward within @xmath8 au .",
    "overall , almost all ( 94% - 100% ) of the terrestrial material were cleared out of the habitable zone . in cases 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , not a single test particle survived in the habitable zone . if the simulations continued for longer than @xmath5 myr",
    ", the remaining test particles would likely dwindle to zero .",
    "the study of @xcite shows that where terrestrial planets form is likely to depend on the configuration of giant planets within the same system .",
    "systems in which there is significant dynamical excitation of planetary embryos around 1  au form a smaller number of planets , which lie closer to the star .",
    "massive planet scattering provides an extreme example of such dynamical excitation . in hot and dynamically excited enough systems , collisions between growing embryos",
    "are , in fact , more likely erosive then accretional .",
    "although , as shown in table 1 , all jovian - mass planets remain in prograde orbits with inclinations less than @xmath34 , the inclinations of the test particles are scattered over the entire @xmath35 range , even for those particles that remain in the habitable zone .",
    "retrograde test particles orbits are triggered by crossing orbits with the prograde jovian planets .",
    "further , the eccentricities of the test particles that remain in the habitable zone after @xmath5 myr are highly variable and encompass the entire allowable range .",
    "this distribution suggests that even in those systems where enough material survives in the inner planetary system to form terrestrial planets , the characteristics of the resulting planets could differ between systems where scattering of giant planets has occurred and those where it has not . by analogy with the calculations of @xcite , one might expect that terrestrial planets that form subsequent to giant planet scattering would typically lie closer to the star , and possibly have significant inclinations relative to the surviving giant planets .",
    "such planets would be a stark contrast to what is seen in the solar system .    by design , the final state of the systems that we have simulated includes an innermost giant planet with orbital properties similar to those of many known extrasolar planetary systems ( significant eccentricity , semi - major axis of a few  au ) .",
    "if we consider _ only _ this innermost planet , thereby ignoring both",
    "the possibility of additional planets today and the dynamical history , then the habitable zone admits relatively stable circular orbits within which terrestrial planets might form .",
    "specifically , as shown in table  2 , if we integrate case 1 forward an additional 2  myr with only the innermost giant planet and a new population of test particles on circular orbits in the habitable zone , then nearly a quarter survive .",
    "this result conforms well to that of @xcite for real extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "we also investigated the stability of orbits in the inner planetary system of case 1 when the existence of the outer planet  which survived the initial evolution leading to ejection of one planet  was considered . in this case interactions between the two massive planets",
    "lead to variations in their eccentricity ; these variations slowly eject test particles placed ( again ) on initially circular orbits at smaller radii .",
    "reasonably plausible planet formation scenarios that result in eccentric giant planets are thus doubly hazardous to terrestrial planet formation  not only because of the initial round of ejections but also because of subsequent secular evolution which can sweep clear much of the material in the inner planetary system .",
    "the main result of this letter is that terrestrial planet formation is likely to be more difficult in planetary systems in which there is an eccentric giant planet at moderate orbital radius ( 2 to 3  au for the specific configuration studied here ) , _ if _ giant planet eccentricity is a consequence of scattering in young multiple planet systems .",
    "this conclusion implies that - at fixed stellar metallicity - there may be fewer terrestrial planets orbiting stars with massive planets in this semimajor axis range than around stars with more distant giant planets .",
    "however , an observed lack of terrestrial planets in such systems does not necessarily imply that they were molded by gravitational instability .",
    "the existence of a possible anti - correlation between the presence of eccentric giant planets and terrestrial planets should be testable using the sample of terrestrial planets discovered by the _",
    "transit mission @xcite .",
    "with plausible assumptions , _ kepler _ should identify of the order of @xmath36 stars with terrestrial planets , along with around 30 giant planets with @xmath37 .",
    "given even modest relative inclinations between giant and terrestrial planets in the same system , the small yield of outer orbit giants means that _ kepler _ on its own will not provide a statistical picture of the typical configuration of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of the stars harboring terrestrial planets , however , will provide useful information on the presence or absence of outer giant planets .",
    "_ kepler _ target stars for the terrestrial planet search have @xmath38 , and should be bright enough to allow radial velocity measurements with precision of tens of meters per second ( for comparison , existing observations of ogle - tr-56 by @xcite attain a precision of @xmath39 at @xmath40 ) .",
    "radial velocity surveys show that about 2% of target stars have massive planets in the range @xmath41 , with that fraction rising rapidly for metal - rich stars @xcite .",
    "there should , therefore , be enough terrestrial planets found for radial velocity follow - up to either confirm or rule out the anti - correlation with eccentric giant planets proposed in this paper .",
