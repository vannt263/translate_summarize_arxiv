    "since the final particles are necessarily parallel to each other and to the total momentum , monotonicity implies that this allows @xmath49 to be lowered , e.g. by reducing @xmath11 at fixed @xmath37 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore @xmath47 can not be a threshold configuration , hence the initial particle momenta must always be anti - parallel at a threshold .",

    "these intermediate intersection points look like thresholds locally in @xmath7 but are not global thresholds .",
    "nevertheless they could in principle yield interesting phenomenology .",
    "since they do not occur for simple models of lorentz violating dispersion however , we will not analyze them in detail here .",
    "we simply mention that their kinematic configuration will be the same as for global thresholds and their locations in @xmath7 determined in the same manner .",
    "the possibility of upper thresholds in the presence of lorentz violating dispersion was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite for particle decays and in ref .",
    "@xcite was discussed in the context of photon annihilation to an electron - positron pair @xmath50 . in  @xcite",
    "the analysis was generalized to allow for the possibility of asymmetric pair production ( discussed in the next subsection ) and a wider class of dispersion relations . here",
    "we make some general remarks about the the origin of this peculiar feature of lorentz violating kinematics .",
    "if lorentz invariance holds , then there is never an upper threshold .",
    "this is can be seen by transforming to the center of mass frame , in which the total incoming four - momentum is @xmath51 .",
    "suppose the final particles have masses @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and that @xmath54 .",
    "then energy and momentum are conserved with the final particle four - momenta @xmath55 and @xmath56 for some choice of @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath7 grows , the condition @xmath57 is always met for a head - on collision with lorentz invariant dispersion , hence there is no upper threshold .",
    "this argument exploited the lorentz invariant form of the dispersion relations to guarantee that 1 ) the total four - momentum is timelike , 2 ) the energy of each particle in the center of mass frame is an unbounded positive function of the momentum @xmath58 , and 3 ) the center of mass energy increases without bound as @xmath7 increases .",
    "any of these properties can fail to hold for non lorentz invariant dispersion relations .",
    "in particular , if a monotonic unbounded lorentz violating dispersion relation is transformed from the preferred frame to another frame , it will in general no longer be monotonic or unbounded .",
    "that upper thresholds exist for lv dispersion relations is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : efall ] .",
    "since different particles can have different dispersion , the curve @xmath35 can be varied independently from @xmath49 and hence @xmath30 by choosing various dispersion relations for the initial particles ( assuming the initial and final particles are different ) .",
    "if we choose a dispersion relation such that @xmath35 enters and leaves the region @xmath36 then this reaction has an upper and lower threshold for that choice of dispersion .      unlike in lorentz invariant physics ,",
    "reactions with identical final particle dispersion can have ( both upper and lower ) threshold configurations for which the two final momenta are not equal .",
    "this was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of photon decay and photon annihilation .",
    "the example of photon decay will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we start by analyzing the lorentz invariant case and then show how it is modified when lorentz invariance is violated .",
    "a familiar result in lorentz invariant physics is that the threshold configuration for pair production of massive particles is symmetric in the final momentum distribution , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that in the center of mass frame the final particles must be created at rest at threshold , so in any other frame they have equal momenta ( since they have the same mass ) . to understand the lorentz violating case it is useful to re - derive this fact without using the lorentz transformation to the center of mass frame , since the dispersion relations are not lorentz invariant and one can not even always boost to the center of mass frame .    at any threshold",
    "the final momenta are parallel and the initial momenta are anti - parallel , and momentum conservation holds .",
    "suppose that @xmath60 .",
    "momentum conservation can be preserved while while lowering @xmath10 and raising @xmath11 by an equal amount . in a lorentz invariant theory",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath61 for each of the outgoing ( massive ) particles always has positive curvature with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore @xmath62 is greater at @xmath63 than at @xmath64 . since @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are changed by opposite amounts we have @xmath65 therefore @xmath49 can be lowered , implying that @xmath66 is not a threshold .",
    "similarly @xmath11 can not be greater than @xmath10 , hence @xmath59 at a threshold .",
    "the previous argument does not depend specifically on lorentz invariance .",
    "hence it establishes a general result :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * condition for symmetry of pair production * : _ pair production is always symmetric at threshold provided the outgoing particle dispersion relation has positive curvature with respect to momentum .",

    "symmetric can be found by computing the variation @xmath68 induced by variations @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 away from the symmetric solution @xmath59 .",
    "the first order variations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 cancel , so we have @xmath71_{p = p_3 }   \\nonumber \\\\&= & \\left . \\frac { \\partial^2 e_o } { \\partial p^2 } \\right|_{p = p_3}\\ , ( \\delta p)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath49 can be lowered by moving away from the @xmath59 configuration if the dispersion relations are such that @xmath72 at @xmath73 , where @xmath74 intersects the boundary of @xmath36 . in such a case",
    "the outgoing particle momenta are not symmetric at the threshold .",
    "this condition on @xmath75 is sufficient but not necessary for having an asymmetric threshold , since the energy may be locally minimized by the symmetric configuration but not globally minimized .",
    "to illustrate the general results we now discuss the case of photon decay to an electron - positron pair .",
    "the example is chosen for its simplicity , so one can easily see how the threshold phenomena depend on the values of the lorentz violating parameters .",
    "we refer to @xcite for analysis of further cases of direct observational relevance .",
    "consider the following deformed photon and electron dispersion relations respectively : @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are dimensionless parameters and @xmath81 gev is approximately the planck mass .",
    "the physical idea is that these are just the deformations of lowest order in @xmath82 .",
    "observed photons have energies far below @xmath83 , so we will calculate the threshold in the regime where @xmath84 .",
    "hereafter we adopt units with @xmath85 .    in the lorentz - invariant case",
    "@xmath86 the photon can not decay .",
    "the final energy region @xmath36 asymptotes to the line @xmath87 in the @xmath4-@xmath58 plane , while the incoming energy curve is just @xmath88 which never enters @xmath36 . the simplest way to allow",
    "photon decay is to let @xmath78 or @xmath79 be positive and nonzero . in this case",
    ", @xmath89 enters @xmath36 and never leaves , so there is a lower threshold but no upper threshold .",
    "since the electron / positron energy function @xmath90 has positive curvature , this lower threshold configuration is symmetric in the final momenta .    to allow for an upper threshold we can take @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) . at sufficiently large @xmath94 the @xmath95 term in the photon dispersion relation will cause the @xmath96 to dip back down and exit @xmath36 , again at a symmetric configuration . to determine the value of @xmath94 at these thresholds we invoke the threshold configuration theorem and the positive curvature of @xmath90 to set the final momenta each equal to @xmath97 .",
    "energy conservation then yields @xmath98 the lower and upper thresholds occur at the lower and upper positive roots of eq .",
    "( [ eq : casea ] ) . for a numerical example , let us suppose that @xmath99 .",
    "the maximum of the left hand side of ( [ eq : casea ] ) occurs at @xmath100 , where it is equal to @xmath101 . in order to have a threshold",
    "this must be larger than @xmath102 , so @xmath103 .",
    "the threshold is at @xmath104 tev for this critical value of epsilon , and for larger epsilon the lower threshold is below 28 tev while the upper threshold is above 28 tev . to obtain an example with asymmetric thresholds we must introduce negative curvature in the electron dispersion relation ,",
    "hence we allow for @xmath105 .",
    "the case with @xmath106 and @xmath107 was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that there is never an upper threshold and there can be a lower threshold which is either symmetric or asymmetric , depending on the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we now sketch how that conclusion is reached .",
    "since the final momenta are not necessarily equal at threshold , the algebra is more complicated . to keep it manageable we expand the dispersion relations to lowest order in the small quantities .",
    "using the fact that the final momenta are parallel at threshold we set the positron momentum equal to @xmath108 , and the energy conservation equation then becomes @xmath109 this equation is valid as long as both @xmath58 and @xmath108 are much greater than the mass @xmath110 , and all momenta are much smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "( for a careful discussion about the validity of the expansion see ref .",
    "@xcite .    were we to incorrectly assume the threshold to be always symmetric , we would set @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : econ ] ) and conclude that it is given by @xmath112 this would also imply that there is only a threshold when @xmath113 . however , this result is incorrect .",
    "a threshold occurs when @xmath49 is minimized for a fixed @xmath94 .",
    "while the value @xmath111 always corresponds to a stationary point of @xmath49 ( since the final particles have equal mass ) , this point can be a maximum rather than a minimum .",
    "( in general it could also be a local minimum that is not the global minimum , but that possibility does not occur in the present example . ) for @xmath114 , the electron dispersion relation has positive curvature , so the symmetric point is the minimum and the symmetric threshold ( [ eq : sym ] ) applies . when @xmath80 is negative , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the symmetric threshold applies for @xmath115 , but for @xmath92 there is an asymmetric threshold whenever @xmath116 : @xmath117^{1/3 } } \\label{eq : asym}\\ ] ] the amount of asymmetry is given by @xmath118 .",
    "if one incorrectly assumed that the threshold were always symmetric , one would miss the region @xmath119 where there is an asymmetric threshold and no symmetric solution .",
    "moreover , in the overlapping region @xmath120 where the actual threshold is asymmetric but a symmetric solution does exist , the symmetric threshold formula ( [ eq : sym ] ) would simply give the wrong result for the threshold .",
    "for a numerical example , let @xmath121 .",
    "then for @xmath122 there is an asymmetric threshold @xmath123 tev and no symmetric solution .",
    "for @xmath124 there is again an asymmetric threshold @xmath125 tev , and a ( non - threshold ) symmetric solution @xmath126 tev .",
    "much of the apparent simplicity of the familiar structure of thresholds in lorentz invariant theories derives from the fact that one can always transform to the center of mass frame .",
    "we have seen that in a lorentz violating context there can be surprising threshold behavior .",
    "nevertheless , as we have shown , certain basic kinematic relations always pertain to threshold configurations as long as the dispersion relations are rotationally invariant and monotonically increasing with momentum .",
