    "early near - infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic observations of galactic snrs have shown that these objects present remarkably strong features ( e.g. graham , wright & longmore 1987 ) .",
    "this has been proposed to be mainly due to the existence of an extended postshock region in which the ionization conditions are such that fe@xmath6 can be efficiently excited by electron collisions ( mouri , kawara & taniguchi 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , the spatial extent of this zone , where hydrogen is partially ionized , is small in photoionized regions , resulting in little emission ( e.g. luhman , engelbracht & luhman 1998 ) .",
    "this peculiarity can be used as a diagnostic probe of supernova activity in distant starburst galaxies where the snrs are generally unresolved and are thought to produce much of the integrated near - ir emission ( e.g. vanzi & rieke 1997 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that using near - ir lines to estimate supernova activity can potentially be superior to the usual radio technique , in that it more clearly distinguishes h ii regions from snrs .    from estimates of the _ total _ luminosity of a starburst galaxy ( @xmath7}}$ ] ) and assumptions regarding the typical values of the luminosity ( @xmath8}}$ ] ) and [ fe ii]-emitting lifetime ( @xmath9}}$ ] ) of a _ single _ snr , one can define the supernova rate , @xmath10 , as : @xmath11}}}{t_{{\\rm [ fe \\ : ii } ] } \\ :   l_{{\\rm [ fe \\ : ii ] } } } { \\rm \\hspace*{0.2 cm }   yr^{-1}}\\ ] ] this quantity can be used , for instance , to set constraints on the star formation history of starburst galaxies ( e.g. leitherer & heckman 1995 ; kotilainen 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the supernova rate derived by this technique is considerably uncertain , as it scales with @xmath9}}$ ] and @xmath8}}$ ] which are poorly known .",
    "the [ fe ii]-emitting lifetime of a snr is generally taken to be of the order of 12 @xmath12 10@xmath4 yr , but this estimate lies on weak grounds ( e.g. van der werf 1993 ) . on the other hand , the few luminosities quoted in the literature for snrs in our galaxy , the lmc or m33 span a wide range of values ( from 0.3 to 720 l@xmath13 ; graham 1987 ; oliva , moorwood & danziger 1989 , 1990 ; lumsden & puxley 1995  hereafter lp ) .",
    "one issue of particular importance is to understand why snrs in starburst galaxies exhibit dramatically higher luminosities ( up to 1.6 @xmath12 10@xmath14 l@xmath13 in m82 ; greenhouse 1997 ) .",
    "one order of magnitude higher values are also observed in ngc 253 ( forbes 1993 ) . before using near - ir features to estimate supernova activity in star - forming galaxies that presumably exhibit widely different properties ( e.g. metallicity )",
    ", one must first understand what parameters control the properties of individual snrs .",
    "many factors ( e.g. evolutionary status of the snr , density or metallicity of the local ism ) are susceptible to play a role in producing this observed luminosity range , although their relative importance has yet to be established .",
    "in an effort to address this issue , we present the results of a project in which narrowband images are used to secure luminosities for a large sample of extragalactic snrs spanning a wide range of physical properties and evolutionary status .",
    "previous efforts to determine the luminosities of individual snrs have mainly concentrated on aperture photometry of galactic remnants .",
    "the shortcomings of such an approach are numerous : ( i ) those observations sample , in most cases , only a very small part of the snr , rendering the total value of the luminosity considerably uncertain ; ( ii ) because of the different apertures used , the published line luminosities do not constitute a homogeneous database based on which meaningful statistical studies can be conducted ; ( iii ) the luminosities are entached of large uncertainties , as the distance to these snrs and the extinction corrections are generally poorly known . on the other hand , because of the unavoidable limited size of the aperture , surveys in nearby galaxies carried out using long - slit spectroscopy exclude the largest objects and are therefore biased towards the youngest snrs ( see lp ) .",
    "line - imaging observations of snr populations in local group galaxies do not suffer from these limitations .",
    "m33 is an obvious target in this respect because of its relatively face - on orientation ( @xmath15 @xmath2 55@xmath16 ; garcia - gomez & athanassoula 1991 ) , well - known distance ( @xmath17 @xmath2 840 kpc ; freedman , wilson & madore 1991 ) and substantial abundance gradient that allows an investigation of metallicity effects ( smith 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has the largest catalogued extragalactic snr population ( gordon 1999 ) .",
    "of particular importance is the fact that a large body of observational data exists for snrs in this galaxy ; as will be shown below , this will allow us to relate the near - ir emission to observations in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the latest catalogue of optically - selected snr candidates in m33 comprises 98 objects ( gordon 1998 ) ; many of which being detected at radio frequencies ( gordon 1999 , and references therein ) . among this sample ,",
    "72 objects have been spectroscopically confirmed and therefore also have well - defined optical - line properties ( gordon 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , a _ rosat _",
    "survey of m33 has associated some x - ray sources with known snrs ( long et al .",
    "our observations were obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in 1997 and 1998 , using the ir cameras monica and redeye , respectively . for both runs ,",
    "the cameras were equipped with a 256 @xmath12 256 pixels hgcdte nicmos-3 detector array . at the _",
    "f_/8 cassegrain focus of the cfht , the image scales are 0.246 ( monica ) and 0.5 arcsec pixel@xmath18 ( redeye ) . for the assumed distance to m33 ( @xmath17 @xmath2 840 kpc )",
    ", this translates into a physical scale of 1 and 2 pc pixel@xmath18 , respectively . in this configuration ,",
    "the fields of view are about 63 ( monica ) and 128 arcsec ( redeye ) .",
    "the interference filters used are a narrowband filter ( fwhm @xmath2 0.02 @xmath19 m ) centred on ( a@xmath4d@xmath20 @xmath21 a@xmath4f@xmath22 ) and a wideband _",
    "the filter is sufficiently wide that the broadening due to motions of the remnant gas , the rotation or the redshift of m33 do not shift lines to significantly different parts of the transmission curve . in total 42 objects drawn from the optically - selected catalogue of gordon ( 1998 )",
    "have been observed .",
    "the vast majority has been spectroscopically confirmed ( blair & kirshner 1985 ; smith 1993 ; gordon 1998 ) .",
    "particular attention has been paid to observe snrs with widely different properties .",
    "the journal of observations is presented in table 1 .    for each snr",
    "we have obtained 5 images : one centred on the object and 4 offset to the no , ne , so and se by 22 and 45 arcsec for monica and redeye , respectively .",
    "these images were later combined in a mosaic centred on the snr .",
    "two type of domeflats have been obtained ( dome lights `` on '' and `` off '' ) .",
    "the latter has been subtracted from the former in order to remove the contribution from the thermal background .",
    "these domeflats have been used to correct for changes in the quantum efficiency of the pixels in each object image .",
    "a mean sky frame has been created by applying a pixel - to - pixel median filtering procedure with proper masking of sources to the data frames themselves .",
    "no off - source images have been obtained .",
    "this procedure is justified in our case , as we are not attempting to detect uniform large - scale emission , but rather compact sources on the arcsecond scale ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "after subtraction of this mean sky frame to the individual object frames and multiplication by a bad pixel mask in order to account for dead pixels , the object images were aligned and coadded .",
    "the astrometric calibration was carried out with reference to positions of stars in the usno - a2.0 or gsc1.2 catalogues .",
    "the positions are accurate to within 3 arcsec .",
    "among our sample of 42 objects , only 7 have been firmly detected ( we address in section 6.1 the physical reasons for such a low detection rate ) .",
    "1 shows the and _ h_-band images of this subset .",
    "the luminosities are quoted in table 2 , along with the 3@xmath23 upper limits for the remaining snrs ( col .",
    "the targets were observed at similar airmasses as the standard stars , eliminating the need to correct for atmospheric extinction .",
    "this is legitimate in the _ h _ band , where such corrections are small . using the optical extinction measurements of blair & kirshner ( 1985 ) and the interstellar reddening law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 )",
    ", it is also found that reddening corrections are negligible .",
    "the contribution of br12 @xmath241.641 @xmath19 m and [ si i ] @xmath241.645 @xmath19 m to the total flux in the filter has been neglected ( see oliva 1989 ) .",
    "the non - detection of any significant flux in the _",
    "h_-band images also indicates that the contribution from continuum emission is negligible ( see also lp ) .",
    "the flux calibration was achieved by using faint standard stars in the list of hunt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the internal accuracy is typically 0.011 mag in the _ h _ band .",
    "some of our objects have been observed in near - ir spectroscopy by lp .",
    "we have adopted their values whenever appropriate ( i.e. when the object was detected in their survey but not in ours or when they set a more stringent upper limit ) .",
    "four objects have been detected in both surveys and can be used to assess the robustness of our luminosity calibration ( this is in particular necessary when considering that some of our observations were acquired while some cirrus clouds were present ; see table 1 ) . in all cases ,",
    "both values are found to agree within the uncertainties .",
    "the internal consistency of our data can also be examined by comparing repeated observations of snr28 taken under different photometric conditions , as detailed in table 1 .",
    "once again , these quantities are found to be statistically undistinguishable .",
    "these checks confirm the reliability of our derived luminosities .",
    "the contour maps of the detected snrs are shown in fig .",
    "although the limited spatial resolution of our images prevents us to examine this aspect in detail , a comparison with hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) or ground - based optical images ( blair & davidsen 1993 ; gordon 1998 ) reveals roughly similar [ fe ii]- and optical - line morphologies .",
    "we note significant differences between the diameters determined from our images and from optical observations ( gordon 1998 ) .",
    "this might result from difficulties in subjectively assigning diameters for objects with complex morphologies ( see blair & davidsen 1993 ) .",
    "in order to pin down the physical processes that are responsible for the emission , we sought for correlations between the luminosities and various quantities intrinsic to the snrs ( e.g. optical - line properties ) .",
    "these data were gathered from the literature and are quoted in table 2 .",
    "a number of statistical methods have been developed to investigate relationships between astronomical data sets with censored data ( e.g. with upper limits ) .",
    "we made use here of the generalized kendall s @xmath25 correlation technique ( isobe , feigelson & nelson 1986 ) .",
    "table 3 summarizes the results of this statistical analysis for all quantities under consideration . when a significant correlation is present ( we consider this to be the case when the false alarm probability is less than 1 per cent ) , we give the results of a linear regression fit to the data for the _ detected _ objects ( such regression techniques for censored data yield unreliable results in the presence of heavy censoring ) . we also show in fig .",
    "3 the dependence of on the quantity in question .",
    "survival analysis techniques yield more reliable results when the censored points are randomly distributed , a condition that is generally not fulfilled here ( see fig.3 ) . in order to assess the robustness of our results",
    ", we performed the same analysis when only considering firm detections .",
    "this procedure broadly confirms the correlations previously found ( albeit with a lower level of significance ) , and suggests that the results inferred by taking into account all the available information ( i.e. detections _ and _ upper limits ) can be regarded as robust .",

    "the fact that the level of emission scales with density may help to understand the differences that exist between the near - ir properties of snr populations in galaxies with moderate star formation activity ( such as m33 ) and starburst galaxies .",

    "the [ fe ii ] emission in ngc 253 is believed to mainly arise from snrs in the disk of the galaxy , and not from superwind- or agn - related phenomena ( forbes 1993 ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that these densities are typical of the postshock regions of snrs in the central regions of this galaxy . keeping in mind that our empirical relation ( equation 5 ) relates to the density derived from the [ s ii ] doublet and that the density in the [ fe ii]-emitting region is about 5 times higher ( e.g. oliva 1989 )",

    "can easily be reached for these snrs .",
    "however , it appears that density effects alone have difficulties in explaining the high luminosities of the brightest sources in m82 ( up to 1.6 @xmath12 10@xmath14 l@xmath0 ; greenhouse 1997 ) .",
    "two effects might account for this discrepancy .",
    "first , the snr might expand in the interclump medium of molecular clouds , with the result that we severely underestimate @xmath1 ( chevalier & fransson 2001 ) .",
    "second , in regard of the high space density of snrs in the compact star - forming regions of this galaxy ( huang 1994 ) , it is far from clear that the strong sources mapped by greenhouse ( 1997 ) can be identified with individual snrs .",
    "the radius at which a snr enters the radiative phase scales with the initial blast energy , @xmath36 , and upstream hydrogen number density , @xmath37 , as : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40@xmath41 ( blondin 1998 ) .",
    "regardless of the details of the original explosion , one therefore expects the bright snrs in starburst galaxies to be less spatially extended ( by a factor 25 ) than the detected snrs in m33 ( with @xmath42 @xmath2 21 pc ) .",
    "it is thus plausible that the exceptionally strong sources in m82 ( with sizes up to 40 pc ) are made up of several individual snrs with diameters in the range 410 pc .",
    "we conclude that the dichotomy between the properties of snrs in quiescent and in starburst galaxies may be interpreted as a result of the different ism densities prevailing in both type of galaxies .",
    "although clear metallicity effects have not been uncovered from our data , we also note that a substantial enrichment in metals is expected in the hostile environments of starburst regions ( because of high chemical abundances and/or processing via grain destruction of the large reservoir of dust grains ) and might also potentially contribute to strong emission .",
    "to estimate the typical [ fe ii]-emitting lifetime of a snr , we consider the integrated luminosity corrected for extinction in the central 2.4 arcsec @xmath12 12 arcsec region of ngc 253 : @xmath8}}$ ] @xmath2 1.3 @xmath12 10@xmath14 l@xmath0 ( engelbracht 1998 ) .",

    "<S> in an effort to better calibrate the supernova rate of starburst galaxies as determined from near - infrared features , we report on a line - imaging survey of a sample of 42 optically - selected supernova remnants ( snrs ) in m33 . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of luminosities are observed within our sample ( from less than 6 to 695 l@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our data suggest that the bright snrs are entering the radiative phase and that the density of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) largely controls the amount of emission . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the following relation between the line luminosity of _ radiative _ snrs and the electronic density of the postshock gas , @xmath1 : ( l@xmath0 ) @xmath2 1.1 @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a correlation in our data between and the metallicity of the shock - heated gas , but the physical interpretation of this result remains inconclusive , as our data also show a correlation between the metallicity and @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . the dramatically higher level of emission from snrs in the central regions of starburst galaxies is most likely due to their dense environments , although metallicity effects might also be important . </S>",
    "<S> the typical [ fe ii]-emitting lifetime of a snr in the central regions of starburst galaxies is found to be of the order of 10@xmath4 yr . on the basis of these results , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a new empirical relation allowing the determination of the current supernova rate of starburst galaxies from their integrated near - infrared luminosity .    </S>",
