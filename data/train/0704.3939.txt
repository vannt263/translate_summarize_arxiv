    "this article deals with the construction of magnetic monopoles , algebraic curves subject to certain transcendental constraints and number theory .",
    "magnetic monopoles , or the topological soliton solutions of yang - mills - higgs gauge theories in three space dimensions , have been objects of fascination for over a quarter of a century .",
    "bps monopoles in particular have been the focus of much research ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these monopoles arise as a limit in which the higgs potential is removed and satisfy a first order bogomolny equation @xmath1 ( together with certain boundary conditions , the remnant of the higgs potential ) . here",
    "@xmath2 is the field strength associated to a gauge field @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the higgs field .",
    "these equations may be viewed as a dimensional reduction of the four dimensional self - dual equations upon setting all functions independent of @xmath5 and identifying @xmath6 .",
    "just as ward s twistor transform relates instanton solutions in @xmath7 to certain holomorphic vector bundles over the twistor space @xmath8 , hitchin showed @xcite that the dimensional reduction leading to bps monopoles could be made at the twistor level as well .",
    "mini - twistor space is a two dimensional complex manifold isomorphic to t@xmath9 , and bps monopoles may be identified with certain bundles over this space . in particular",
    "a curve @xmath10 t@xmath9 , the spectral curve , arises in this construction and , subject to certain nonsingularity conditions , hitchin was able to prove all monopoles could be obtained by this approach @xcite .",
    "nahm also gave a transform of the adhm instanton construction to produce bps monopoles @xcite .",
    "the resulting nahm s equations have lax form and the corresponding spectral curve is again @xmath11 .",
    "these curves @xmath11 are the curves of the title .",
    "hitchin s construction ( as we shall soon recall ) places various transcendental constraints upon them and the outstanding and difficult problem is to construct curves satisfying these constraints .",
    "now , given an appropriate curve , ercolani and sinha showed in their seminal paper @xcite how one could solve ( a gauge transform of ) the nahm equations in terms of a baker - akhiezer function for the curve @xmath11 .",
    "the authors have extended this work @xcite and , given a curve , one can solve both the nahm data and reconstruct the desired monopole in terms of standard integrable systems constructions .",
    "our purpose here is not to focus on this integrable system side of the story but on the curves @xmath11 and we shall only cite various formulae as needed to illustrate the type of detail needed of a curve in order to implement the construction . the number theory ( and in particular ` ramanujan ' of the title ) appear when we try to implement the transcendental constraints on the curve and construct the required quantities associated with the curve .",
    "this is the story we now recount .",
    "an outline of our article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the relevant aspects of the hitchin and ercolani - sinha constructions .",
    "this recounts the constraints of hitchin and we highlight the ingredients needed to make effective the integrable system construction and show how these reduce to evaluating quantities intrinsic to the curve .",
    "the first hurdle in implementing the construction is to analytically determine the period matrix for @xmath11 and then understand the theta divisor . in section 3",
    "we will introduce a class of ( genus 4 ) curves for which we can do this .",
    "they are of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are distinct complex numbers .",
    "( for appropriate @xmath13 this yields a charge 3 monopole . )",
    "this class of curves was studied by wellstein over one hundred years ago @xcite and more recently by matsumoto @xcite . here",
    "we will introduce our homology basis and define branch points in terms of @xmath15-constants following @xcite .",
    "corresponding to ( some of ) hitchin s nonsingularity conditions ercolani and sinha obtain restrictions on the allowed period matrices for the spectral curve .",
    "equivalent formulations of these conditions were given in @xcite .",
    "the ercolani - sinha conditions are transcendental constraints and to solve these is the next ( perhaps _ the _ ) major hurdle to overcome in the construction . in section 4",
    "we do this for our curves . at this stage",
    "we have replaced the constraints by relations between various hypergeometric integrals . to simplify matters for the present paper we next demand more symmetry and consider in section 5 the genus 4 curves @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a certain real parameter .",
    "this restriction has the effect of reducing the number of hypergeometric integrals to be calculated to two .",
    "interestingly the relations we demand of these integrals are assertions of ramanujan only recently proven .",
    "we will denote curves of the form ( [ bren03 ] ) as _ symmetric monopole _ curves ( though in fact they may not satisfy all of hitchin s nonsingularity conditions ) .",
    "the tetrahedrally symmetric charge 3 monopole is of this form .",
    "the curve ( [ bren03 ] ) covers a hyperelliptic curve of genus two and two elliptic curves .",
    "we discuss these coverings . using weierstrass - poincar reduction theory we are able to express the theta function behaviour of these symmetric monopoles in terms of elliptic functions and fairly comprehensive results",
    "may be obtained .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we shall consider the curve ( [ bren03 ] ) associated with tetrahedrally symmetric 3-monopole when the above parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this genus 4 curve covers 4 elliptic curves and all entries to the period matrices are expressible in terms of elliptic moduli .",
    "the analytical means which we are using for our analysis involve thomae - type formulae , weierstrass - poincar reduction theory , multivariable hypergeometric function and higher hypergeometric equalities of goursat .",
    "our conclusions in section 7 will highlight various of our results .",
    "_ this article is based upon the second part of the preprint @xcite .",
    "new theoretical results and the unwieldy length of that paper have led us to separate general constructions from the exploration of the transcendental constraints upon which we now report . _",
    "in this section we shall recount the transcendental constraints placed upon the spectral curve coming from hitchin s construction .",
    "we shall then describe those quantities related to the curve needed in the ercolani - sinha construction and its extensions .",
    "using twistor methods hitchin @xcite has shown that each static @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs monopole in the bps limit with magnetic charge @xmath19 is equivalent to a spectral curve of a restricted form .",
    "if @xmath20 is the inhomogeneous coordinate on the riemann sphere , and @xmath21 are the standard local coordinates on @xmath22 ( defined by @xmath23 ) , the spectral curve is an algebraic curve @xmath24 which has the form @xmath25 here @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) is a polynomial in @xmath20 of maximum degree @xmath28 .",
    "the hitchin data constrains the curve @xmath11 explicitly in terms of the polynomial @xmath29 and implicitly in terms of the behaviour of various line bundles on @xmath11 .",
    "if the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath30 are @xmath31 $ ] we consider the standard covering of this by the open sets @xmath32\\,|\\,\\zeta_0\\ne0\\}$ ] and @xmath33\\,|\\,\\zeta_1\\ne0\\}$ ] , with @xmath34 the usual coordinate on @xmath35 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath36 the pre - images of these sets under the projection map @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the holomorphic line bundle on @xmath22 defined by the transition function @xmath39 on @xmath40 , and let @xmath41 be similarly defined in terms of the transition function @xmath42 .",
    "a holomorphic section of such line bundles is given in terms of holomorphic functions @xmath43 on @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 .",
    "we denote line bundles on @xmath11 in the same way , where now we have holomorphic functions @xmath43 defined on @xmath46 .",
    "the hitchin data constrains the curve to satisfy : + * h1*. reality conditions",
    "@xmath47    * h2*. @xmath48 is trivial on @xmath11 and @xmath49 is real .",
    "+ * h3*. @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "+ the reality conditions express the requirement that @xmath11 is real with respect to the standard real structure on @xmath22 @xmath52 this is the anti - holomorphic involution defined by reversing the orientation of the lines in @xmath53 .",
    "a consequence of the reality condition is that we may parameterise @xmath26 as follows , @xmath54 \\prod_{k=1}\\sp{r}(\\zeta-\\alpha_k)(\\zeta+\\frac{1}{\\overline{\\alpha}_k}),\\qquad \\alpha_r\\in \\mathbb{c},\\ \\chi_r\\in\\mathbb{r}.\\ ] ] thus each @xmath26 contributes @xmath55 ( real ) parameters . certainly this constraint may be readily implemented .",
    "the remaining two constraints are however transcendental .",
    "the triviality of @xmath48 on @xmath11 means that there exists a nowhere - vanishing holomorphic section . in terms of our open sets",
    "@xmath36 we then have two , nowhere - vanishing holomorphic functions , @xmath56 on @xmath57 and @xmath58 on @xmath59 , such that on @xmath60 @xmath61 ercolani and sinha utilize this to give an alternate characterisation we will present in due course .    for a generic @xmath19-monopole",
    "the spectral curve is irreducible and has genus @xmath62 .",
    "this may be calculated as follows . for fixed @xmath20 the @xmath19 roots of @xmath63 yield an @xmath19-fold covering of the riemann sphere .",
    "the branch points of this covering are given by @xmath64 this expression is of degree @xmath65 in @xmath20 and so by the riemann - hurwitz theorem we have that @xmath66 whence the genus as stated",
    ".    the @xmath67 monopole spectral curve is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is any point in @xmath53 .",
    "in general the three independent real coefficients of @xmath70 may be interpreted as the centre of the monopole in @xmath71 .",
    "strongly centred monopoles have the origin as center and hence @xmath72 .",
    "the group @xmath73 of rotations of @xmath71 induces an action on @xmath22 via the corresponding @xmath74 transformations . if @xmath75 the transformation on @xmath22 given by @xmath76 corresponds to a rotation by @xmath15 around @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "( here the @xmath82 transformation is given by the derivative of the @xmath20 transformation . )",
    "the @xmath73 action commutes with the real structure @xmath83 .",
    "although a general mbius transformation does not change the period matrix of a curve @xmath11 only the subgroup @xmath84 preserves the desired reality properties .",

    "it is perhaps worth emphasising that the reality conditions are an extrinsic feature of the curve ( encoding the space - time aspect of the problem ) whereas the intrinsic properties of the curve are invariant under birational transformations or the full mbius group .",
    "such extrinsic aspects are not a part of the usual integrable system story .      in order to implement the reconstruction of the nahm data and monopole associated to a curve @xmath11 various other quantities",
    "are also required .",
    "we shall now describe these and in so doing express ercolani and sinhas s alternate characterisation of one of hitchin s transcendental constraints .",
    "the spectral curve ( [ spectcurve ] ) is an @xmath19-sheeted cover of @xmath9 . by a rotation",
    "if necessary it is always possible to choose @xmath19 distinct preimages @xmath89 of @xmath90 and consequently the roots of @xmath91 near @xmath90 behave as @xmath92 where the @xmath93 may be assumed distinct . as a consequence",
    "we see that at @xmath94 we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a local coordinate . also from ( [ arpar ] )",

    "this differential yields the flow on the jacobian corresponding to the time evolution of the system .",

    "ercolani and sinha now make the following connection between ( [ wvec ] ) and h2 . consider the logarithmic derivative of ( [ triv3 ] ) representing the triviality of @xmath48 on @xmath11 , @xmath105 ( hurtubise considered a similar construction in the @xmath106 case @xcite . ) now in order to avoid essential singularities in @xmath107 we have from ( [ rhodef ] , [ rhobdef ] ) that @xmath108 because @xmath109 is a function on @xmath110 , then @xmath111 for all cycles @xmath112 from @xmath113 .",

    "note that @xmath125 or otherwise @xmath99 would be holomorphic contrary to our choice .    using the bilinear relations we have that , for any holomorphic differential @xmath126 , @xmath127 houghton , manton and ramo utilise this expression to express a dual form of the ercolani - sinha constraints ( [ esc1 ] ) .",
    "define the 1-cycle @xmath128 then ( upon recalling that @xmath129 , where @xmath83 is the period matrix ) we have the equivalent constraint : @xmath130 the right - hand side of this equation is readily evaluated .",
    "we may express an arbitrary holomorphic differential @xmath126 as , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath133 in @xmath20 . thus using ( [ rhodef ] )",

    "@xmath137 @xmath138    here ( 2 ) is the dual form of the ercolani - sinha constraints given by houghton , manton and ramo .",
    "their 1-cycle generalises a similar constraint arising in the work of corrigan and goddard @xcite .",
    "the only difference between ( 3 ) and that of ercolani - sinha theorem ii.2 is in the form of @xmath139 in which we disagree .",
    "we also know that @xmath140 .",
    "the ercolani - sinha constraints impose @xmath141 conditions on the period matrix of our curve .",
    "we have seen that the coefficients @xmath26 each give @xmath55 ( real ) parameters , thus the moduli space of charge @xmath19 centred @xmath0 monopoles is @xmath142 ( real ) dimensional .",

    "* p164 ) that the triviality of @xmath120 together with the antiholomorphic isomorphism @xmath144 yields an imaginary lattice point with respect to @xmath145 .",
    "the final constraint of hitchin and various quantities needed for our purposes are encoded in the expressions @xmath146 which we shall now unpack .",

    "( they can be explicitly described in terms of theta functions and the quantities introduced already , but we do not need this for our present purposes . ) now the full condition h3 is that @xmath163 for @xmath149 .",
    "this constraint must be checked using knowledge of the @xmath164 divisor .",
    "the exact sequence @xmath165 given by multiplication by a section of @xmath166 does however give us the necessary condition @xmath167 if @xmath168 were trivial we would have a section , contradicting this vanishing result .",
    "the same treatment given to the triviality of @xmath120 shows that if @xmath168 were trivial then @xmath169 .",

    "the case of @xmath106 has been treated by several authors and going beyond these results we consider the case of @xmath176 in the remaining portion of this work . before doing this",
