    "here we study the motion of microtubules in the context of cytoplasmic streaming in stage 10b-11 drosophila oocytes . at that stage ,",
    "the roughly hemispherical oocyte is bounded by a plasma membrane and an underlying cortex comprised of an actin filament meshwork .",
    "long microtubules , with minus ends attached to the cortex , have their plus ends free .",
    "kinesin-1 motor proteins that walk along the microtubules toward plus ends generate opposing forces on the microtubule and the surrounding viscous cytoplasm .",
    "cytoplasm is thus moved toward plus ends , generating vigorous flows for mixing . because minus ends are anchored , the equal but opposite force on a microtubule generates dynamic bending along its length .",
    "the results of this work have been used to understand this phenomenon in recent work by the authors  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the equation for a microtubule with an applied force tangent to the direction of chain .",
    "the position of the microtubule at arclength @xmath0 and at time @xmath1 is denoted @xmath2 . as is usual at small scales , all inertial effects are negligible and",
    "the system is dominated by the drag coefficient per unit length @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xmath5 denotes the elastic bending constant of the microtubule .",
    "the tension @xmath6 enforces the inextensibility of microtubules which can be written as @xmath7 kinesin motors walking along the microtubule are assumed to be carrying cargo that acts as an impeller pushing the surrounding cytoplasmic medium . by newton",
    "s third law , this force produces a drag on the impellers that transmits this force to the attached microtubule . assuming a high density of kinesin walkers , the effective force on the microtubule will be in the direction of the local tangent to @xmath8 which is @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 gives the strength of the force .",
    "lastly we add a uniform flow field representing the velocity of the cytoplasm @xmath11 in the vicinity of the microtubule which we take to be in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "we rescale to dimensionless variables @xmath13 so that @xmath14 this requires that @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants that make our new variables dimensionless",
    ".    we will consider solutions where one end ( the _ minus _ end ) is tethered to a point , say the origin , so that @xmath18 and is freely hinged at that point .",
    "the other end is free .",
    "the total arclength of the microtubule is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the general characteristic of all numerical solutions to eq .",
    "[ eq : microtubule ] is that for large @xmath0 the solutions appear to be travelling waves .",
    "in fact , the form of solution becomes independent of @xmath19 so in fact we could consider this problem in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "for example we find solutions that asymptotically become helical with a fixed path and radius for large @xmath0 .",
    "other solutions are planar and are periodic in @xmath0 . in all these cases",
    "the solution has the form of a travelling wave that we analyze in detail below .",
    "now we look for steady state travelling wave solutions .",
    "first we clarify what this means .",
    "the whole microtubule should not be translating because one end , ( far away from where the travelling wave solution is valid ) is tethered .",
    "the position averaged over one period of a monomer , @xmath21 , should be time independent . if the microtubule is stretched out in one particular direction , there should be a displacement @xmath22 of the microtubule about a straight line solution , @xmath23 the term @xmath22 describes a displacement that travels along the backbone of the chain maintaining its shape .",
    "therefore we require @xmath24    substituting eq . [",
    "eq : travelling ] into eq .",
    "[ eq : dimensionless ] gives a left hand side of @xmath25 and a term of the form @xmath26 on the right hand side .",
    "choosing @xmath27 and in addition @xmath28 , we are left with    @xmath29    we define @xmath30 and note that the inextensibility requirement @xmath31 implies that @xmath32 .",
    "we can write @xmath33 note that @xmath34 depends only on @xmath35 . because @xmath36 is a function of only one variable @xmath37",
    ", we can integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : reduced_steadystate ] with respect to @xmath38 obtaining @xmath39 the integration constant on the right hand side @xmath40 must lie in the @xmath12 direction by symmetry .",
    "this is the same equation as that of the classical mechanics of a particle of unit mass , with position @xmath36 travelling on the surface of a unit sphere under the influence of gravity , with the variable @xmath38 being analogous to time .",
    "the term @xmath41 is a normal force that constrains the particle to stay on the sphere s surface .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : ud_constraint ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bw = bd_alpha ] we see that the motion is subject to the constraint @xmath42 the constant @xmath43 and the initial conditions of the particle must be chosen so as to satisfy this constraint .",
    "there is an infinite number of solutions satisfying these conditions leading to different steady state solutions for the microtubule .",
    "the spherical pendulum eq .",
    "[ eq : sphericalmotion ] has been analyzed  @xcite in detail .",
    "in general the orbits will not be closed , but we will relegate our discussion below to two cases where this is the case , circular motion in eq .",
    "[ eq : sphericalmotion ] , corresponding to helical conformations of a microtubule , and motion in the @xmath44 plane , corresponding to solutions similar in shape to cycloids .      one important point to notice about the general structure of eq .",
    "[ eq : sphericalmotion ] is its invariance under change of @xmath38 , that is @xmath45 .",
    "a change in scale of @xmath46 does not modify the solution , because @xmath47 and @xmath43 are both constraints , and can therefore be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "so that if @xmath48 is a solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : sphericalmotion ] , so is @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore all solutions of this form will have the same @xmath50 and hence the same @xmath51 .",
    "note that a length scale shift of @xmath52 corresponds to a displacement of @xmath53 , which changes scale because of the @xmath54 prefactor in this expression .",
    "this means that for every steady state conformation of the microtubule , there exists a family of steady state solutions with identical shape but arbitrary size .",
    "circular orbits are solutions to eq .",
    "[ eq : sphericalmotion ] . eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha_constraint ] requires that the vertical height of the orbit be at @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the radius perpendicular to @xmath12 ( the @xmath56 plane ) is @xmath57 it is first easiest to analyze this by direct analogy to the classical mechanical problem of a unit mass particle moving on a unit sphere ( the spherical pendulum ) .",
    "if the height above the sphere is @xmath51 , then application of newton s laws gives that the tension must balance the force of gravity @xmath43 and the centripetal acceleration @xmath58 giving @xmath59 where @xmath60 is not the real velocity of the microtubule but @xmath61 .",
    "this is the rate at which the tangent vector rotates in the @xmath62 plane . because @xmath63 is a constant",
    ", @xmath64 is a circle . therefore according to eq .",
    "[ eq : travelling ] , this will give a helical conformation of the microtubule .",
    "in the spherical pendulum analogy , the angular velocity of the particle is @xmath65 .",
    "the total arclength of the chain ( in dimensionless units ) of a single period of the chain is @xmath66 and @xmath67 so that @xmath68 . comparing this with eq .",
    "[ eq : sralpha ] we obtain @xmath69 using eq .",
    "[ eq : w_perp_alpha ] this gives @xmath70 because @xmath43 is a free parameter , @xmath60 can be any positive number and therefore eq . [ eq : ralpha_v ] implies that the radius of the helix can be arbitrary .    because the velocity of this travelling wave is unity , the spatial and temporal periodicities are equal .",
    "therefore the period of rotation of the helix @xmath71 is equal to @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sralpha ] , in the dimensionless units that we are using .",
    "therefore the relationship between the period and the pitch is @xmath73 in terms of our original units the period is @xmath74      we now consider orbits in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "this corresponds to a pendulum swinging around vertically through the bottom of the sphere .",

    "low energy solutions where the total energy @xmath78 is less than @xmath43 give @xmath75 oscillating between two bounds . in this case",
    "the curve for the microtubule will look sinusoidal . beyond the separatrix where @xmath79 , @xmath75 will increase without bound .",
    "this gives rise to microtubule conformations that look close to prolate cycloids .",
    "in other words , the microtubule forms a travelling wave that periodically loops backwards .",
