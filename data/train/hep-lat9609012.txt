    "in lattice qcd , one of the fundamental challenges is to minimize the errors caused by discretizing space - time .",
    "this is accomplished through a combination of advances in computer technology , and advances in the formulation of methods to solve the problem computationally , including the development of improved numerical algorithms .",
    "we show an example of how an improved gauge field action can be used to suppress artificial lattice contributions to physical measurements .",
    "we consider gluon actions that are constructed in a gauge invariant fashion , from a combination of casimir invariants of closed wilson loops . in principle , a lattice action of this type can consist of an arbitrary sum of wilson loops , but a truncation to a small set of localized loops is necessary due to computational expense . we study actions constructed from @xmath0 and @xmath1 loops :    @lcl@ & @xmath2 @xmath3&@xmath4&@xmath5 @xmath3&@xmath6&@xmath7 $ ] @xmath3&@xmath8&@xmath9 $ ]    where the actions and coefficients , in order of increasing improvement ( approximation to the renormalization trajectory ) are given by :    @lcccc@ action & @xmath10&@xmath11&@xmath12&@xmath13wa & @xmath14&@xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15 sw & @xmath16&@xmath17&@xmath15&@xmath15 rgt & @xmath18&@xmath19&@xmath20&@xmath21 .    to compare these three actions ,",
    "we generate four ensembles :    @lrrrr@ action & & @xmath22 & & @xmath23 wilson & @xmath24 & @xmath25&@xmath26&@xmath27sw & @xmath28 & @xmath29&@xmath30&@xmath31sw & @xmath28 & @xmath32&@xmath26&@xmath33rgt & @xmath34 & @xmath35&@xmath26&@xmath36    the two sw ensembles allow us to study the effect of increasing @xmath22 , we have used estimates of corresponding wilson action @xmath22 from the deconfining phase transition temperature calculation by cella _ et al._@xcite .",
    "since we have used a modest number of configurations in each case , we focus on the qualitative comparison between wilson and improved actions . further calculations with a larger number of lattices would be needed for quantitative studies , for example , to determine the consistency and scaling of @xmath37 .",
    "lattice topology provides a test case for comparing various gauge field actions .",
    "there are several prescriptions for measuring topological charge @xmath38 on the lattice , and each prescription is subject to a different set of lattice cutoffs and renormalizations which affect the measurement of the topological susceptibility @xmath39 . in the plaquette method",
    "the topological density @xmath40 is constructed from a product of lattice @xmath0 wilson loops .",
    "this method in general gives noninteger values of the topological charge , and is affected by large multiplicative and additive lattice renormalizations@xcite .",
    "the geometric method@xcite does guarantee an integer topological charge ( except for `` exceptional '' configurations ) but is not guaranteed to obey physical scaling in the continuum limit , and is in fact known to violate scaling for the wilson action@xcite .",
    "low - action dislocations which can be suppressed by improving the action@xcite contaminate the geometric @xmath41 .    in the cooling prescription ,",
    "ultraviolet fluctuations in the fields are removed by locally minimizing the action in successive sweeps , isolating instanton - like configurations . after cooling , a single instanton configuration spanning several lattice spacings has a computed charge of nearly one using either the geometric or plaquette formula ; we therefore apply the plaquette formula to the cooled configurations to obtain a value for @xmath42 .",
    "lattice artifacts are very different among these methods , and we can in general get different results for plaquette ( @xmath43 ) , the geometric ( @xmath44 ) , and the cooling ( @xmath45 ) topological charges computed on the same original configuration . for improved actions , we expect lattice artifacts such as dislocations to be suppressed , therefore we test this prediction by comparing the different topological charge methods _ with each other_.    the cooling prescription actually encompasses a family of cooling algorithms .",
    "typically one cools by selecting a link @xmath46 to minimize some action @xmath47 , and since cooling is merely used as a tool to isolate instantons , there is no reason to tie @xmath47 to the monte carlo gauge action @xmath48 .",
    "the cooling algorithms @xmath47 we consider here are linear combinations of wilson loops with coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and since action is minimized only the ratio @xmath51 is significant .",
    "the cooling algorithm with @xmath52 removes the leading scaling violation from the classical instanton action , and we also include cooling algorithms with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which has been derived from a linear weak coupling approximation to the rgt action , for comparison . for the case @xmath53 , the lack of barrier to a decrease in the instanton size causes the instanton to disappear by implosion during the cooling process , and for @xmath54 a large instanton expands until halted by the boundary .",
    "we cool for @xmath55 sweeps for all three algorithms , and the comparison between these three in an indication of the systematic effect of picking some particular means of cooling .",
    "we note that with @xmath55 sweeps of wilson cooling most of the topological charges are retained , since the large instantons havent had enough time to implode .",
    "in general , we do not see any effect from the selection of the cooling algorithm , except perhaps in one ensemble .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm",
    "as described above , we compute @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 on all of our lattices .",
    "we show two scatter plots ( figures [ fig : qgcwa ] , [ fig : qgcra ] ) highlighting the discrepancy between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the best fit line is constructed through the points on a scatter plot .",
    "the slope of this line is an estimate of the ratio of multiplicative renormalizations , and should be close to @xmath56 since both the geometric and cooling methods give integer charges .",
    "the correlation @xmath57 between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a measure of random additive artifacts seen by one method but not the other , such as dislocations which disappear during cooling therefore contributing only to @xmath44 but not to @xmath45 .",
    "the scatter plots show a strong correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the rgt action , and a far weaker correlation for the wa , suggesting that the effect of lattice artifacts on topological charge is far less pronounced for the improved action .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgc ] we show a comparison between the wa , sw , and rgt actions of the correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . fig .",
    "[ fig : zpc ] similarly shows the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath45 , computed in the same manner as @xmath68 , and numerical values are in table [ tab : corr ] .",
    "the sw action serves as an intermediate point between the other two actions , since the rgt action represents a better estimate of the renormalization trajectory than the wa and sw actions .",
    "it is unclear whether the spread in @xmath68 at @xmath69 is due to any systematic effect of the cooling algorithm .",
    "it is possible that for better improved actions , where the exponential suppression of dislocations is greater than for the s - w action , increasing beta will have a more profound effect than we have seen here for the s - w action . for the plaquette method ,",
    "we have shown previously@xcite that the multiplicative @xmath70 becomes less severe as the action improves , and the increased correlation @xmath71 suggests that the additive renormalization also decreases .",
    "in addition , improving the action is far more effective than increasing @xmath22 for suppressing lattice artifacts .",
    "future calculations can include a more comprehensive study of other improved actions .",
    "other methods for @xmath41 , including the fermionic method@xcite , and an indirect measurement by calculating the @xmath72 mass@xcite , should also be tested .",
    "having established a correlation between cooled and uncooled topology and located individual instantons , we are now prepared to investigate shuryak s picture of a dilute instanton gas , and the influence of instantons on hadronic physics by working directly on uncooled lattices .",
