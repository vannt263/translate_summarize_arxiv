    "the intrinsic x - ray continuum of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to be produced in the immediate vicinity of the central black hole .",
    "phenomenologically , the nuclear continuum can be described as a power law , typically with a photon index of 1.82.0 , with an exponential cut - off at 150350  kev @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted model for formation of this spectral component is the inverse compton scattering of the thermal radiation from the accretion disk by relativistic electrons distributed around the black hole in a structure referred to as the corona ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of the coronal spectrum is a function of the seed photon field , the kinetic temperature of the plasma , the geometry of the corona and the observer orientation .",
    "previous studies suggest that the corona does not uniformly cover the surface of the accretion disk @xcite , and that it is likely compact @xcite . microlensing measurements on distant quasars",
    "confirm the compactness of the x - ray - emitting region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , other physical parameters of agn coronae are currently poorly constrained due to the lack of direct observations in the hard x - ray band , as well as the degeneracy introduced by contributions from the processed ( reflected ) spectra from the inner regions of the accretion disk and the dusty molecular torus at larger distances ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "disentangling those spectral components requires high - quality hard x - ray data .",
    "we report on the high - energy cut - off measurement and coronal parameters of the active nucleus of the nearby ( @xmath7 ; 36  mpc ) seyfert  1.9 galaxy @xcite , using data in the 379  kev band @xcite .",
    "this agn has been extensively observed in the soft x - ray band @xcite , revealing a complex structure of the flourescent line emission , including both broad and narrow components produced by the disk and the torus reflection , respectively .",
    "the high - energy spectrum , however , has been only poorly constrained thus far : e.g. , @xcite and @xcite found high - energy cut - offs at @xmath8 and @xmath9  kev from data , @xcite found it at @xmath10  kev using data , @xcite combined and to support a variable cut - off between 50 and @xmath11100  kev , while other results in the literature only placed lower limits in the 100200  kev range .",
    "the main reason for the discrepant measurements in the past is likely the degeneracy between a cut - off at @xmath12  kev and a strong reflection continuum .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio achieved in the observations of with allows us to clearly separate the spectral curvature due to the reflection continuum from the spectral curvature due to the coronal cut - off . in  [ sec : observations ] we report on the observations and in  [ sec : modeling ] we present our spectral analysis . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the potential issues and the physical properties of the corona , and briefly summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "observed on two occasions : on 2012 july 1112 ( obsid 10002019 ) , and on 2013 june 37 ( obsid 60001046 ) .",
    "the first observation was conducted as a part of the calibration campaign .",
    "the second observation was a science observation carried out simultaneously with a long observation .",
    "we defer the broadband ( 0.579  kev ) spectral analysis of the simultaneous and data taken in 2013 to a forthcoming paper ( zoghbi _ et al .",
    "_ , _ in prep .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the 2012 and 2013 observations as the _ calibration _ and _ science _ observations , respectively .",
    "the event files were cleaned and processed using the nustardas software package ( version 1.2.1 ) and the scripts nupipeline and nuproducts @xcite .",
    "after the automated processing by the pipeline , the total source exposure is 34  ks for the calibration observation , and 160  ks for the science observation .",
    "we extracted the source spectra from circular regions 120  in radius , centered on the peak of the source image .",
    "corresponding background spectra were extracted from polygonal regions encompassing the same detector , but avoiding the region within 140  from the source image peak .",
    "we estimate that at most 2% of the background counts above 25  kev can be due to contamination by the source .",
    "the response matrices were generated using the calibration database ( caldb ) version 20131223 .",
    "the analysis presented here is based predominantly on the higher - quality science observation , while the calibration observation is used to investigate the spectral variability on the timescale of one year .",
    "the count rate was variable at the level of @xmath13% during the long science observation , and @xmath1420% during the calibration observation .",
    "the variability on timescales of @xmath141-ks is addressed in detail in a separate publication @xcite . for the analysis presented in this paper , we use the observation - averaged spectra from each of the two focal plane modules ( fpma and fpmb ) , and fit them jointly for each of the two observations , allowing for the cross - normalization constant to vary freely in all fits .",
    "the normalization offset is found to be smaller than 5% in all cases , as expected from instrument calibration @xcite .",
    "we model the data in ( version 12.8.1 ; @xcite ) using @xmath15 statistics . in order for @xmath15 statistics to provide unbiased results we group the data to have a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 10 per bin after background subtraction .",
    "all uncertainties on spectral parameters are reported as 90% confidence intervals from marginalized probability distributions determined using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm available in @xmath6 .",
    "we start the analysis with a simple absorbed power - law model : tbabs@xmath16ztbabs@xmath16pow in @xmath6 .",
    "the first absorption component ( tbabs ; @xcite ) represents galactic absorption fixed to a column density of @xmath17  @xmath18 @xcite , while the redshifted component ( ztbabs ) accounts for additional absorption by the host galaxy .",
    "the redshift is fixed to @xmath7 @xcite , and the host column density is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this model fits the data from the science observation very poorly , with a reduced @xmath15 ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of degrees of freedom ) , in excess of 3 .",
    "the best - fit model for the science observation data and the residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , in order to highlight the main features that hint towards more appropriate models .",
    "the residuals in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] show signatures of a reprocessed ( reflected ) component : a neutral iron k@xmath21 emission line ( 6.4  kev ) and a broad compton hump peaking at 2030  kev .",
    "we therefore replace the continuum of the previous model with a component @xcite , and add two gaussian components ( one broad and one unresolved ; following @xcite ) to model the line .",
    "includes both the intrinsic power - law continuum and the reflection of that continuum from optically thick material .",
    "we keep the inclination angle fixed at the default value ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and leave chemical abundances fixed at solar values . for the initial fit , we also keep the energy of the power - law cut - off fixed far above the upper end of the bandpass at 1000  kev .",
    "this model fits the science observation data much better than the previous one ( @xmath19=1513/1124=1.35 ) .",
    "the best - fit photon index and absorption column density are @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the broad gaussian line component ( @xmath26  kev ) is best fitted at a slightly higher energy than the neutral iron k@xmath21 line : @xmath27  kev .",
    "fitting for the energy of the narrow line component does not improve the best fit significantly ( @xmath28 ) , so we leave it fixed at 6.4  kev .",
    "the reflection is found to be strong , with a relative normalization @xmath29 , but clearly insufficient to account for all the curvature present in the hard x - ray spectrum  as indicated by the residuals of the best fit displayed in the middle right panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .    letting the cut - off energy vary in the optimization results in a significant improvement of the best fit : @xmath19=1163/1124=1.03 ( @xmath30 for one additional free parameter ) .",
    "this verifies that a cut - off at @xmath31  kev is robustly detected within the band .",
    "the best fit column density is @xmath32  @xmath18 , which is consistent with the much more precise measurement , @xmath33  @xmath18 , from the joint modeling of the simultaneous and data ( zoghbi _ et al .",
    "_ , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) freezing @xmath34 to @xmath35  @xmath18 results in @xmath36 . for consistency with our work on the joint dataset , we keep @xmath34 fixed hereafter .",

    "the broad iron line is best fitted with @xmath40  kev and @xmath41  kev . the model curve and the residuals",
    "are plotted in comparison to the previous ones in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the final form of our phenomenological model is tbabs@xmath16ztbabs@xmath16(zgauss[@xmath42+pexrav ) . applying this model to the data from the calibration observation",
    ", we find that most of the best - fit spectral parameters are consistent with those of the longer science observation ( the exception being @xmath43 ) , albeit less well constrained due to lower photon statistics .",
    "the best - fit parameters and their 90% confidence intervals are given in table  [ tab : model_parameters ] for both observations .",
    "the flux was @xmath44% lower in the 210  kev band during the calibration observation , but the two observations can be modeled self - consistently with just the normalization of the primary continuum and the relative reflection normalization changing significantly between the observations .",
    "although we explored other models suggested in the literature , we find that neither adding a second reflection component , nor replacing the and the line components with ( linking those components self - consistently ; @xcite ) , nor modeling the broad iron line with a relativistic broadening model , reaches lower @xmath19 . more importantly ,",
    "those alternative models confirm the measurement of @xmath45 to be robust and , in the worst case , marginally consistent with the 90% confidence interval based on the phenomenological model presented here .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : discussion - robustness ] .      in the previous section we established that the coronal continuum can be approximated as a power law with an exponential cut - off at high energies .",
    "more physical models ( such as the comptt model of @xcite ) assume a geometry for the corona and allow for determination of its physical parameters from the data .",
    "in such models , low - energy ( @xmath46uv ) photons from the accretion disk are compton - scattered by hot electrons in the plasma .",
    "the spatial distribution of the coronal plasma can be approximated with simple geometrical shapes , such as a sphere centered on the black hole , or a slab covering the surface of the accretion disk . in terminology",
    ", we replace the continuum with a refl(comptt ) component : comptt models the intrinsic coronal continuum for either a slab ( disk - like ) or a spherical geometry , and refl convolves it with reflection features .",
    "we fix the thermal photon temperature to 30  ev , which is appropriate for an agn accretion disk and does not influence the output spectrum much .",
    "we leave the reflector inclination fixed at @xmath47 and iron abundance fixed at the solar value .",
    "we find that both geometries can provide a good description of the science observation data : the best - fit @xmath15 is 1163 for the slab model , and 1161 for the spherical model , both with 1124 degrees of freedom . in either geometry",
    "the coronal temperature ( @xmath48 ) and the optical depth ( @xmath49 ) are very well constrained and strongly correlated , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . in the case of a slab geometry",
    "we find @xmath1  kev and @xmath2 , while for the spherical one the best fit is found for @xmath3  kev and @xmath4 .",
    "all other parameters are found to be consistent with values determined from the simpler phenomenological models .",
    "we find qualitatively and quantitatively similar results for the calibration observation data .",
    "finally , we also verify that consistent results are obtained with a more elaborate coronal model , compps @xcite . while the best - fit parameters may not agree with the comptt values within the uncertainties in all cases , the results are qualitatively the same .",

    "we find that the normalization of the former does not change significantly between the two observations and conclude that the change is due to the relative increase of the coronal continuum flux .",
    "the flux of the broad iron line component is constant between the observations within the 90% confidence interval .",
    "the spectral variability may be due to the time delay between variations in the coronal continuum and its reflection by the distant torus .",
    "alternatively , an effective change in @xmath43 may be due to a long - term physical change in the coronal geometry , such as its height above the accretion disk , or in the innermost region of the accretion disk itself .      as demonstrated in  [ sec : modeling - pheno ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , a high - energy cut - off is clearly required by the data . even though the cut - off energy ( @xmath45 ) is above the upper end of the bandpass , strong curvature is apparent below 79  kev and allows for determination of @xmath45 to @xmath97% ( statistical uncertainty ; 90% confidence ) . the best - fit value of @xmath45 , however , depends on the assumptions that go into the simple model we fit to the data .",

    "a two - component reflection model leads to best - fit @xmath45 between 110 and 124  kev , depending on different assumptions .",
    "the typical statistical uncertainty on the best - fit @xmath45 in any particular fit to the science observation data is approximately 7  kev ( 2030  kev for the calibration observation ) , with the iron abundance left free to vary and the ionization and the relativistic broadening parameters fixed close to values found in previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the systematics introduced by assuming a particular model are comparable to the statistical uncertainties in the case of the science observation of @xmath6 , and are therefore important to consider . with the full flexibility in the shape of the complex reflection continuum , the data robustly constrain @xmath45 to the slightly broader 105130  kev interval , skewed towards the lower end and centered around 115  kev ( when marginalized over different assumptions ) .    for high - quality data systematic uncertainty comparable to statistical uncertainty may also arise from arbitrary choices of the source and background extraction regions , and the choice of binning . for the @xmath45 measurement presented in this paper",
    ", we have verified that different choices give results consistent with those discussed above .",
    "systematics are clearly less of an issue with lower - quality data , as demonstrated by the calibration observation data presented here : in that case the constraints on spectral parameters are weakened , and the systematic uncertainty gets absorbed in the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this has been the case for the majority of the similar measurements on other agn published so far , including the recent ones based on the data @xcite . as in the case of ic",
    "4329a @xcite , additional constraints come from joint analyses of simultaneous soft and hard x - ray datasets , leading to further improvement in constraining @xmath45 .",
    "the high - energy cut - offs have been measured with a relative uncertainty of @xmath1130% for a relatively small sample of bright nearby agn ; most of the agn observed with previous generation of hard x - ray instruments provide lower limits on this parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using the data , the cut - off energies have recently been measured for ic  4329a ( @xmath105  kev ; @xcite ) , swift  j2127.4@xmath1065654 ( @xmath107  kev ; @xcite ) and 3c  382 ( @xmath108 and @xmath109  kev in two distinct spectral states ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high quality of the spectra in the hard x - ray band up to 79  kev enable reliable independent measurements of the physical parameters of the corona : its temperature , @xmath48 , and optical depth , @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we present the most precise measurement thus far , with relative uncertainty of 5% ( at the 90% confidence level ) , although , as discussed in  [",
    "sec : discussion - robustness ] , the exact value depends somewhat on nuisance parameters .    we find that , even though the physical parameters such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 are very well constrained by the data , it is still impossible to formally distinguish the geometry . the slab ( disk - like ) and the spherical geometries , as parametrized by the comptt and compps models used here , both describe the spectrum equally well .",
    "we note that a similar result was found in observations of the seyfert  1.2 ic  4329a and the narrow - line seyfert  1 swift  j2127.4@xmath1065654 with @xcite . both of these agn and are radio - quiet , however , they differ in other properties . with",
    "a mass of the super - massive black hole of @xmath110@xmath111 @xcite , the mean intrinsic 210  kev luminosity of @xmath112  ergs@xmath113 ( see table  [ tab : model_parameters ] ) and a bolometric correction from @xcite , is accreting at approximately 5% of the eddington rate .",
    "this is almost an order of magnitude less than the key other two agn .",
    "interestingly , swift  j2127.4@xmath1065654 has the lowest black hole mass and the lowest cut - off , followed by in the middle , and ic  4329a with highest mass and cut - off energy . in a number of other agn ,",
    "a stringent lower limit on the cut - off energy was placed using the data , indicating a generally higher coronal temperature and lower optical depths , e.g. , @xmath114  kev in 3c  382 @xcite and in ark  120  @xcite , and @xmath115  kev in ngc  2110  @xcite . using long - term averaged data from @xmath6 ,",
    "@xcite constrained cut - off energies for 26 agn in the range between 50 and 200  kev , some of which have been or will be observed with @xmath6 . with more high - quality measurements in the near future , covering a wide range of physical properties , it will be possible to directly probe the physics of the agn corona . in order to distinguish the fine differences due to the coronal geometry , longer observations of sources with a weaker reflection continuum will be needed .",
    "the difference between the optical depth in the two geometries tested here is partially due to the different geometrical definition : whereas in the spherical case it is taken in the radial direction , in the case of slab geometry it is taken vertically , creating a natural offset by a factor of @xmath116 . for @xmath47 used here , the radial optical depth for the slab geometry becomes almost equal to the one of the spherical corona . the important result",
    "we point out in this paper is that the @xmath117200  kev measurements with pressure the theoretical models towards the high-@xmath49 regime where their validity falls off .",
    "the approximations used in the compps model hold only for low optical depth and the formal limits are @xmath118 for the slab , and @xmath119 for the sphere geometry @xcite .",
    "the limits of the simpler comptt model are even more stringent , although good agreement is found between the analytical model and monte carlo simulations in the @xmath120 regime @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the best - fit optical depth in the two models differs somewhat .",
    "if the high optical depth derived from the currently available models can be interpreted directly , our results imply that the corona must be inhomogenuous .",
    "spectral features and variabilty signatures of reflection from the inner accretion disk are clearly detectable in @xcite and therefore the corona , which covers the disk in either geometry , can not be completely opaque .",
    "homogeneity is one of the assumptions of the coronal models used here , hence pressing against their limits may be indicative of that assumption not being satisfied . alternatively , our result may simply indicate a geometry different from the ones assumed in this work . in either case , we are drawn to the conclusion that new models are needed in order to better understand the physical implications of our result .",
    "in this paper we focus on modeling the hard x - ray spectrum of in order to constrain models of the agn corona .",
    "we first robustly establish that a cut - off is present in the spectrum at @xmath0  kev ( statistical uncertainty ; 90% confidence ) , despite the non - negligible reflection component contributing to curvature of the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "the ability to dissentangle a @xmath121  kev cut - off from the reflection continuum is essentially unique to @xmath6 .",
    "modeling the spectrum with physical models , we find that both slab and spherical geometries of the corona provide equally good fits to the data , albeit for different physical parameters . assuming a simple coronal model ( comptt ) , we find the kinetic temperature of electrons in the corona and its optical depth , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , to be @xmath72 ( @xmath78 )  kev and @xmath74 ( @xmath80 ) for the slab ( spherical ) geometry .",
    "similar results are found for a different , less approximate model ( compps ) .",
    "it is important to note that in all cases the data push the models towards high-@xmath49 values , where their validity drops off .",
    "the relative statistical uncertainty of 5% ( quoted here as a 90% confidence interval ) has never been achieved before and we show that the new level of precision enabled by requires careful consideration of possible systematic uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions . with further measurements at comparable precision for agn with a wide range of properties , and the extension of comptonization models towards the high - opacity regime , it should be possible to construct a clearer physical picture of the agn corona in the near future .",

    "<S> measurements of the high - energy cut - off in the coronal continuum of active galactic nuclei have long been elusive for all but a small number of the brightest examples . </S>",
    "<S> we present a direct measurement of the cut - off energy in the nuclear continuum of the nearby seyfert  1.9 galaxy with unprecedented precision . the high sensitivity of up to 79  kev allows us to clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum from that of its reflection component . using a simple phenomenological model for the hard x - ray spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we constrain the cut - off energy to @xmath0  kev with 90% confidence . testing for more complex models and nuisance parameters that could potentially influence the measurement , we find that the cut - off is detected robustly . </S>",
    "<S> we further use simple comptonized plasma models to provide independent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons in the corona and its optical depth . at the 90% confidence level , we find @xmath1  kev and @xmath2 assuming a slab ( disk - like ) geometry , and @xmath3  kev and @xmath4 assuming a spherical geometry . both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their two principal physical parameters are correlated in both cases . with the optical depth in the @xmath5 regime , the data are pushing the currently available theoretical models of the comptonized plasma to the limits of their validity . </S>",
    "<S> since the spectral features and variability arising from the inner accretion disk have been observed previously in @xmath6 , the inferred high optical depth implies that a spherical or disk - like corona can not be homogeneous . </S>"
