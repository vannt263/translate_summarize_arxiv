    "the long - standing question of whether planets can form and then persist in binary star systems appears to have been answered observationally .",
    "planets have been detected about 55 @xmath8 cancri , @xmath9 bootis and 16 cygni b , all of which have companion stars ( butler  et  al .",
    "1997 ; cochran  et  al .",
    "1997 ) . given that this basic question has been answered , one might now wonder what types of binary systems can harbor planets .    rather than addressing the more difficult issue of how planets are formed in binary systems , a simple question of celestial mechanics",
    "is asked : in what regions of phase space near a binary system could low - mass planets persist for long times ?",
    "an extensive body of literature is dedicated to this question ; just a few recent papers are noted here .",
    "the papers by szebehely ( 1980 ) and szebehely and mckenzie ( 1981 ) are examples of analytic work done on this problem .",
    "graziani and black ( 1981 ) , black ( 1982 ) , and pendleton and black ( 1983 ) used numerical experiments of three body systems to develop empirical stability criteria .",
    "hnon and guyot ( 1970 ) numerically studied the stability of periodic orbits in the circular restricted problem as a function of the mass ratio .",
    "although these studies were for generic systems , they were restricted to the case of the stars following circular orbits .",
    "benest ( 1988 ; 1989 ; 1993 ; 1996 ) explicitly included the eccentricity of the binary in his studies of stability in the @xmath10  centauri , sirius and @xmath11 coronae borealis systems .",
    "dvorak ( 1984 ; 1986 ) , rabl and dvorak ( 1988 ) , and dvorak  et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) have studied the stability of test particles in binary systems with equal mass stars as a function of the binary eccentricity .",
    "this body of literature has three principal limitations .",
    "first , although binaries typically have eccentric orbits , most of the analytic results have been developed for the case of binaries with circular orbits .",
    "second , numerical investigations of stability have been restricted to special cases such as binary systems with equal mass stars or particular binary systems .",
    "third , the numerical investigations been limited to fairly short integrations",
    ". however , the rapid increase in processor speed and improved algorithms make it a straightforward task to extend the numerical results .",
    "orbits in binary systems have been traditionally separated into three categories . following the designations of dvorak and rabl ( 1986 ) ,",
    "the first includes planetary or p - type orbits .",
    "these are well outside the binary , where the planet essentially orbits the center of mass of the stars .",
    "the second type refers to the satellite or s - type orbits .",
    "these are orbits near one of the stars , with the second star considered to be a perturber .",
    "the third type refers to orbits near the @xmath12 or @xmath13 triangular lagrange points .",
    "these orbits are not normally of interest for binary systems as the mass ratio must be less than @xmath14 for motion about these points to be linearly stable .    in this study ,",
    "both p and s - type orbits are examined .",
    "however , the results for the s - type orbits , those close to one of the stars , are more directly applicable to current extrasolar planet searches , as radial velocity variations are more easily detected in systems in which the planets are close to one of the stars .",
    "it is our hope that the results of our investigation can be used as a guide in selecting a sample of suitable candidates for a radial velocity survey of binary systems .",
    "this work is different from that which precedes it in two ways : ( 1 ) a full range of mass ratios has been examined , as well as a full range of eccentricities ; ( 2 ) these integrations extend for much longer times than have been examined in the past .",
    "in addition to looking at the stability of single planets in binary systems , the stability of systems of multiple planets in eccentric binaries is also investigated , albeit briefly .",
    "interactions between planets may affect their stability through angular momentum transfer or other mechanisms .",
    "the results of this part of the investigation help us to understand the limits of results obtained for single planets .",
    "this study investigates orbital stability numerically within the elliptic restricted three body problem .",
    "that is , the planets are modeled as test particles moving in the gravitational field of a pair of stars on fixed eccentric orbits about each other .",
    "as the test particles do not interact with each other , this approach allows us to simulate large numbers of single planet systems simultaneously .",
    "an approach first used by dvorak ( 1986 ) is adopted here .",
    "first , an eccentricity , mass ratio , and initial orbital longitude for the stars is chosen .",
    "second , a battery of test particles on orbits in or near the binary is started .",
    "these particles are on initially circular , prograde orbits in the plane of the binary .",
    "this choice is based on the results from the @xmath10  centauri system ( wiegert and holman 1997 ) in which the largest stable orbit near the stars was found to have an inclination in the plane of the binary . for a range of semimajor axes , test particles",
    "are started at eight uniformly spaced orbital longitudes .    given the initial conditions of the binary system and the test particles , the system is numerically integrated . during the course of the integration close encounters between the test particles and stars",
    "are checked for , close encounters defined arbitrarily to be a passage within @xmath15 of the binary semimajor axis @xmath16 of the non - central star .",
    "escape orbits are also monitored . any test particle that encounters one of the stars or escapes",
    "is removed from the integration . at the end of the integrations , the semimajor axis at which the test particles at all initial longitudes survived the full integration time is determined .",
    "we call this the critical semimajor axis .",
    "the critical semimajor axis determines the stability limit on the time scale of the numerical integration .",
    "note that this approach assumes that the critical semimajor axis is well - defined ( _ i.e .",
    "_ that the boundary between stable and unstable regions is sufficiently sharp ) ; however , this will be shown to be a valid assumption in most cases .",
    "binaries with eccentricities in the range @xmath5-@xmath6 and mass ratio in the range @xmath17 have been examined , though only the range @xmath18 has been studied in the outer region , since systems with mass ratios of @xmath3 and @xmath19 are equivalent in this regime ( with the exception of a @xmath20 change in the particles longitudes ) . by the mass ratio @xmath21",
    "is meant , where @xmath22 is the mass of the star the test particle is orbiting and @xmath23 is the mass of the perturbing star . for equal mass stars @xmath24 . both the eccentricities and mass ratios have been explored in increments of @xmath25 or less .",
    "the initial phase of the binary orbit is also a free parameter .",
    "the two extremes are examined : the binary initially at periapse and initially at apoapse , and the more conservative result is taken ( _ i.e .  _ that for which the stable region is smallest ) , though the results do not differ significantly on this account .",
    "the initial conditions of our primary suite of simulations are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "ccinner region & outer region +   +   + @xmath7 & @xmath18 +   + @xmath26 & @xmath5 +   +   +   + @xmath27 & @xmath28 + @xmath29-@xmath30 & @xmath31 +   +   +    [ table1 ]    for the orbital integrations the symplectic mapping method of wisdom and holman ( 1991 ) was used .",
    "although this technique was developed for numerically integrating systems of planets with a single dominant central mass , it can also be applied to binary systems for orbits close to one of the stars , when the other star is a distant perturber . for orbits in the intervening region ,",
    "where the forces from the two stars are comparable , two techniques are used .",
    "first , the symplectic mapping method is employed , but with a smaller time step .",
    "second , a conventional bulirsch - stoer integrator is used .",
    "the region for which the symplectic mapping method is not well - suited is also the region in which test particles quickly escape , thus it is not necessary to use an efficient method in this region .",
    "table  [ table2 ] shows an example of the results of the numerical integrations in the inner region .",
    "it lists the times survived by test particles as a function of initial orbital longitude and semimajor axis .",
    "this example is for @xmath32 ( equal mass stars ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the times are given in units of 10 binary periods .",
    "a `` + '' marks those test particles that survived the full @xmath2 binary period integration . for this eccentricity and mass ratio",
    "the critical semimajor axis is @xmath34 , as all test particles at or interior to this value survived the full integration .",
    "those with the longest removal times lie along the boundary , with removal time decreasing outward .",
    ".planet survival times in the inner region , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "columns 1 - 8 show survival times for planets in positions 1 - 8 with the stars started at periapse .",
    "column 9 shows the initial semimajor axis of the planets in units where the binary semimajor axis is unity .",
    "columns 10 - 18 give the survival times with the stars started at apoapse .",
    "all times are given in units of 10 binary periods .",
    "a `` + '' indicates the test particle survived @xmath2 binary periods . here",
    "the critical semimajor axis is 0.12 , the farthest semimajor axis at which all the planets survived the full integration .",
    "several of the test particles on the stability boundary were terminated at times longer than the 300 binary periods integrated by rabl  and  dvorak  ( 1988 ) , but the stability boundary was not shifted significantly by extending the integration to @xmath2 binary periods .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table7 ]      our results are very similar to those obtained by dvorak  et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) even though our simulations are 20 times longer .",
    "they find the critical semimajor axis to be essentially independent of @xmath3 , and provide an expression for it in their eq .",
    "however , a comparison of their expressions with their data leads us to suspect that their eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may have their labels switched . their eq .",
    "( 1 ) matches their data for their `` upper critical orbit '' ( our `` critical semimajor axis '' ) much better than eq .",
    "if the equations are mislabelled , their empirical expression is @xmath37 performing a least - squares fit in the eccentricity , our data points produce @xmath38 with residuals indicating that this expression is within 5% of the experimental value typically , 14% worst case .",
    "dvorak  et  al .",
    "do not provide information on their residuals , but compare their empirical expression with numerical results for a few independent ( _ i.e .",
    "_ real ) binary systems .",
    "they show slightly smaller errors ( typical : within 2% ; worst case : within 10% ) , but their error analysis is limited to only seven independent cases , and only examined what they call the lower critical orbit ( _ i.e .  _ the _ largest _ semimajor axis at which all test particles become _ unstable _ ) .",
    "a comparison of our and their data points with the empirical expressions is provided by fig .",
    "[ fi : ofit ] .",
    "we note that our data contains five points for each value of @xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "our data points follow the same general trend as those of dvorak et  al .  but typically at slightly larger values .",
    "this result indicates that , though the edge between stable and unstable regions may not evolve quickly , the stable region does erode as the time scales considered lengthen , at least at higher binary eccentricities .",
    "we also note that our results are comparable to szebehely and mckenzie s ( 1981 ) analytical results .",
    "they computed the hill s stability criterion for the circular restricted three - body case , and found critical radii @xmath40 , 2.4 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , 0.24 , and 0.5 .",
    "our numerical results for @xmath43 provide @xmath44 , 2.25 , and @xmath45 for the same values of @xmath3 .",
    "the closeness of these results confirms the validity of these numerical integrations , and hints that the hill s stability criterion may provide more insight into the question of the stability of planets in binary star systems .",
    "lastly , wiegert and holman ( 1997 ) found that the outer critical semimajor axis @xmath46 for central binary of @xmath10  cen ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this value is very close to the values derived here , @xmath48 from eq .",
    "[ eq : outercrit ] and @xmath49 from eq .",
    "[ eq : outercrit_e ] , though their integrations ran over three times longer ( 32000 binary periods ) than those presented here .",
    "now that stability limits have been derived for test particles orbiting near one of the stars in a binary system , we consider systems with multiple planets .",
    "innanen  et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) examined the specific effects of a binary companion on the orbits of the planets in our solar system .",
    "we ask a similar but slightly different question : if our own solar system had a solar mass companion in an eccentric orbit how large would its semimajor axis need to be for the planets to survive @xmath50  yr ) ?    this question is addressed with numerical experiments . in the first set of experiments",
    "the system of our own sun and the four giant planets , jupiter through neptune , is augmented with a solar mass companion and then numerical integrated for times up to one billion years .",
    "the companion was initially placed in the invariable plane of the solar system with @xmath51 .",
    "the eccentricity of the companion was 0.4 .",
    "several initial semimajor axes of the companion were tested , and for each value of the initial semimajor axis the system was integrated until the planetary orbits began to cross or became hyperbolic with respect to the sun .",
    "semimajor axes from @xmath52  au to @xmath53  au in increments of @xmath54  au . for all",
    "companion semimajor axes except @xmath55  and  @xmath53  au uranus and neptune cross orbits within @xmath56@xmath57  years . in the @xmath55  and  @xmath53",
    "au the systems survive the full @xmath58  year integrations . that the @xmath55  au system survived but the @xmath59  au system did",
    "not may indicate that particular configurations may have additional stability arising from factors other than the distance of the perturber .    in the second set of experiments we test the effect of a highly inclined solar mass companion on a system of multiple planets .",
    "again we start with our own sun and giant planets . to this",
    "we add a solar mass companion inclined at @xmath60 and @xmath61 to the invariable plane of the sun and planets .",
    "the companion is started with @xmath51 and @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65  au .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath64  au runs are unstable in @xmath56@xmath57  years , but the @xmath65  au runs survive @xmath58  years . in these runs the planets maintain their semimajor axes , eccentricities , and relative inclinations , but the plane of the planets regresses about the normal to the binary orbit .",
    "the @xmath66 run has a 110 myr regression period ; the @xmath67 run has a 400 myr regression period",
    ".    we can compare the results of these experiments to those predicted by eq .",
    "[ expression ] . for @xmath68",
    "au , @xmath24 , and @xmath69 we predict @xmath70  au .",
    "neptune s semimajor axis is @xmath71  au . our empirical expression overestimates the critical semimajor axis by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is partly because , with a system of interacting planets , it is not necessary to completely strip one of the planets from its star to disrupt the system .",
    "it is only necessary to perturb the planetary eccentricities enough that the planets strongly interact .",
    "nevertheless , even with this factor of 2 , it is reassuring that the simple results from the elliptic restricted three body problem predict the correct scale of the stability limit in our solar system .",
    "we have numerically investigated the long - term stability of planets near one of the stars in a binary system . unlike earlier studies , we have examined a full range of mass ratios and eccentricities . from the results we have derived an empirical expression for the semimajor axis inside of which test particles on initially circular orbits",
    "survive the full integration .",
    "this expression is given as a function mass ratio and semimajor axis .",
    "our results for the inner s - type region are confirmed , albeit weakly , by observations of planets in extrasolar binary systems .",
    "where our results examine parameter values studied by earlier investigators , our results are largely consistent , despite our significantly longer integration times .",
    "this fact indicates that the stable / unstable boundary remains consistent over a wide range of time scales , though some evidence for the erosion of the stable regions over time has been seen .",
    "a further important proof of concept is that systems of multiple planets , as modeled by our own outer planets , can remain stable for times of order a billion years in the inner s - type region of an eccentric binary system .",
    "there are several avenues of future work in this field :    * here we have developed a very crude understanding of the limits of stability .",
    "particular isolated regions of phase space near a binary system , at the location of particular resonances , will have different stability properties .",
    "the instabilities associated with the @xmath72:1 mean - motion resonances (   [ pa : outer ] ) , of which only a cursory examination has been made here , are clear evidence of this .",
    "* despite the coincidence of our numerically computed stability boundary with that derived analytically for hill s stability by szebehely and mckenzie ( 1981 ) , as yet we have no analytic derivation of the stability limit , nor do we have a precise understanding of the source of the chaos observed near and beyond the limit .",
    "a semi - analytic stability criterion based on the boundary between chaotic and quasiperiodic motion is presented in mardling and aarseth ( 1998 ) . *",
    "the effects of giving the planets initial non - zero eccentricities , has as yet been studied in only a very few cases ( benest 1988 ; 1989 ; 1996 ) .",
