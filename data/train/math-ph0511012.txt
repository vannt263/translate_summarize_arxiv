    "it turns out that , once the appropriate objects have been defined , the proof of theorem [ ggp ] has the same structure as the modern proof for crystals that can be found for instance in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the crystal case , a periodic potential factorizes through a real valued function defined on a circle . in the quasicrystal case ,",
    "a short range potential factorizes through a real valued function defined on a more sophisticated compact metric space called the _ hull _ of the quasicrystal .",
    "this hull possesses locally the product structure of an interval by a cantor set _",
    "i.e _ it is a solenoid .",
    "this solenoid can be seen as the suspension of the action of a minimal homeomorphism on the cantor set .",
    "minimal homeomorphisms on the cantor set have been extensively studied in topological dynamics and possess a powerful combinatorial description in terms of kakutani - rohlin towers ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of section [ hull ] , which is devoted to the substrate , is to rephrase these well known results in our specific context , namely for a suspension , in order to see the hull as an inverse limit of one dimensional branched manifolds .",
    "these branched manifolds will play a central role in the proof .    in the crystal case ,",
    "when projecting a minimal configuration on the circle , the aubry - mather theory shows that it wraps around the circle in a very special way , namely it is ordered as the orbit of a degree one homeomorphism of circle . in the quasicrystal case ,",
    "there exists also some combinatorial obstructions , they are described and analyzed in section [ com ] which is devoted to the ground states of the overlying layer .",
    "section [ preuve ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ ggp ] .",
    "first , as for the crystal case , we show , using the inverse limit structure of the hull given in section [ hull ] and the combinatorial obstructions gotten in section [ com ] , that minimal configurations have a rotation number ( point @xmath93 ) . then we prove ( again as in the crystal case ) the continuity of the rotation number ( point @xmath94 ) .",
    "the proof of point @xmath95 of theorem [ ggp ] in the crystal case is done first by constructing periodic minimal configurations for any positive rational rotation number and then to use the continuity of the rotation number to get a minimal configuration for any prescribed positive rotation number . in the quasicrystal case ,",
    "the scheme is exactly the same , but the set of rational numbers needs to be replaced by another dense subset of the positive reals .",
    "more precisely when the rotation number is not @xmath62 , its inverse has to be a finite linear combination with positive integer coefficients of the densities of patches of the quasicrystal .",
    "this paper ends with two final remarks developed in section [ fin ] , the first one concerns dynamical systems . in the case of a crystal ,",
    "minimal configurations for the frenkel - kontorova model are orbits of a twist map on an open annulus .",
    "similarly , in the quasicrystal case , these minimal configurations are also orbits of a dynamical system that we describe .",
    "the second one consists in giving the bases of a possible extension of the theory to quasicrystals in higher dimension . + * remark : * it should be pointed out that one can find in the literature several studies on the the frenkel - kontorova model with a quasi - periodic potential , for instance a potential which is the sum of two periodic potentials with incommensurable periods ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "such potential can not arise naturally from an underlying one dimensional substrate .",
    "actually , the underlying object which organizes the minimal configurations and which was a circle in the crystal case and a solenoid in the quasicrystal case , becomes a @xmath96-torus .",
    "more precisely the real line is immersed as a line with irrational slope in the 2-torus . actually , this is a situation more complex than the one we are dealing with in this paper which essentially uses dimension 1 objects , and this explains the lack of exact results in this quasi - periodic case .",
    "+ _ nota bene : _ to avoid an unnecessary dichotomy and unless explicitly specified , the quasicrystals that appear in the sequel will not be crystals .",
    "in this section , we recall some background results concerning quasicrystals . most of these results are true in any dimension and they are presented here in the particular case of the dimension 1 .",

    "it is clear that each translated copy @xmath97 @xmath98 , of @xmath25 is again a quasicrystal .",
    "the set of translated copies @xmath99 of a quasicrystal can be equipped with a topology that , roughly speaking , says that two quasicrystal configurations are close one to the other if in a big ball centered at @xmath62 in @xmath53 , the segments of both configurations inside the ball are equivalent and equal up to a small translation .",
    "such a topology is metrizable and an associated metric can be defined as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) :    consider two quasicrystal configurations @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath99 .",
