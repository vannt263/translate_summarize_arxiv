    "one potentially interesting property of the brane - world scenario with extra dimensions of infinite size is the emission of particles from the brane to the bulk @xcite .",
    "this is one of the ways in which extra dimensions may open up in experiment @xcite and also in astroparticle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "a four - dimensional observer residing on the brane is unable to detect particles escaping to infinity in extra dimensions , so the observable signature is missing energy .",
    "this is analogous to the add model @xcite , in which the kaluza - klein gravitons are also undetectable , and their emission would also manifest itself as missing energy @xcite .",
    "this analogy goes further : in the case of infinite extra dimensions , the spectrum of four - dimensional masses of escaping particles is continuous , while the kk graviton spectrum is also nearly continuous in the add model .    a particular setup that ensures the gravitational quasi - localization of various bulk fields on the brane is a model with one infinite and several compact extra dimensions , equipped with the ads metric @xcite .",
    "this is a mild generalization of the original randall - sundrum ii model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , unlike the rsii geometry , the generalized setup quasi - localizes bulk gauge fields @xcite .",
    "so , it makes sense to consider the emission of vector particles from the brane to the bulk and employ this setup as a concrete example .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we performed a phenomenological analysis of the vector boson emission to the bulk in @xmath7 collisions . in that case ,",
    "the promising process is @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to @xmath2 collisions at the lhc energies and study the process @xmath9 , where energy is carried away by either photon or @xmath1-boson emitted into the bulk .",
    "important constraints on the parameters of the setup come from the analysis of the invisible @xmath1-boson decay @xcite which is due to the fact that the massive @xmath1-boson is quasi - localized , rather then exactly localized on the brane . with these constraints , the prospects of observation of the process we study are not particulary bright for @xmath2 collisions at 7 tev :",
    "its cross section is small compared to the standard model ( sm ) background @xmath4 unless the number of compact extra dimensions is large , @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is better for @xmath2-collision energy of 14 tev . in this case , models with smaller numbers of compact extra dimensions can be probed .",

    "the warp factor is @xmath29 the metric ( [ metrics of the theory ] ) is a solution to the @xmath30-dimensional einstein equations with fine - tuned bulk cosmological constant and brane tension .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is determined by the @xmath32- dimensional planck mass and bulk cosmological constant ; it is the only free parameter of the model .",
    "we call this setup rsii-@xmath0 model .",
    "we consider @xmath32-dimensional @xmath33 gauge theory with bulk gauge fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 and scalar doublet @xmath36 in the background metric ( [ metrics of the theory ] ) .",
    "we assume for definiteness that fermions @xmath37 are localized on the brane and hence depend only on four - dimensional coordinates @xmath38 .",

    "here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath12 bulk couplings , respectively , and @xmath44 is the standard higgs potential .",
    "we consider the higgs phase of the theory and perform the usual redefinition of the gauge fields , @xmath45 @xmath46 then the relevant part of the action ( [ theactionofthetheory ] ) takes the following form : @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the bulk masses squared of the gauge fields .",
    "note that photon remains massless . here",
    "@xmath50 is the quark lagrangian in the higgs phase , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bulk electromagnetic coupling and @xmath55 is the quark electric charge .",
    "in this section we study the properties of the bulk vector fields .",
    "we assume that the sizes of compact extra dimensions are small , so that at energies of interest we have @xmath56",
    ". then the masses of kk modes inhomogeneous in compact dimensions are large and we can ignore kk excitations on the torus .",
    "hence , we take into account only the gapless and continuous kk spectrum corresponding to the motion along the @xmath57 direction . before proceeding further ,",
    "let us discuss the properties of the usual @xmath1-boson in this model .",
    "since the fermions couple only to the components @xmath58 of the field @xmath59 , it is consistent to set @xmath60 and split the @xmath1-boson wave function into longitudinal and transverse parts , @xmath61 .",
    "once the fermion masses are neglected , the fermion currents are conserved on the brane , so the longitudinal @xmath1-bosons are not emitted .",
    "the equation of motion for the transverse mode @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the four - dimensional mass .",
    "we also note that odd eigenmodes of ( [ z equation tr ] ) do not interact with the fermions localized on the brane .",
    "even eigenmodes @xmath66 are normalized with the measure @xmath67 : @xmath68        the solution to eq .",
    "( [ z equation tr ] ) is @xmath69 , \\label{z_m(z)}\\ ] ] where the order of the bessel functions is @xmath70 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 are determined by the boundary condition on the brane @xmath73 and the normalization condition @xmath74 , following from ( [ norm_cond_gapless ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath75 where @xmath76 in the low energy limit only modes with @xmath77 are relevant , and the expression ( [ coefficients_2 ] ) simplifies , @xmath78 in this limit , the squared wave function on the brane is @xmath79 where @xmath80 hence , for @xmath81 , @xmath1-boson is quasi - localized on the brane , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are its mass and invisible decay width , respectively . in particular , @xmath84 tends to the delta function as @xmath85 : @xmath86 this yields the relation between the four - dimensional and five - dimensional couplings , @xmath87 .",
    "the fact that @xmath1-boson is not exactly localized on the brane implies the lower bounds on the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "they come from the requirement that the invisible decay width of @xmath1-boson does not exceed the experimental uncertainty  @xcite : @xmath88 these bounds are collected in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "when presenting numerical results , we will consider the values of @xmath31 saturating these bounds .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      [ table1 ] : [ table1 ] _ the lower bounds on the parameter @xmath31 for various numbers of compact extra dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "_    coming back to the general discussion , we collect ( [ z_m(z ) ] ) and ( [ coefficients_2 ] ) and find the expression for the wave function at the brane : @xmath89 ^ 2 + \\left[j_{\\nu-1}(\\frac{m}{k})+\\frac{k}{m}(\\frac{n}{2}+1-\\nu)j_\\nu(\\frac{m}{k})\\right]^2}}. \\label{z_m(0)tot}\\ ] ] this wave function determines the coupling of fermions to the mode @xmath90 .",
    "hence , it is useful to introduce the @xmath1-boson coupling parameter @xmath91 . expanding the bessel functions at large argument in ( [ z_m(0)tot ] )",

    "note that the curves in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] correspond to different values of @xmath31 .",
    "this explains the fact that the large-@xmath65 asymptotics in fig .",

    "for the relatively light modes with @xmath108 it is suppressed , @xmath109 .",
    "however , this suppression disappears at high energies , @xmath110 at @xmath93 . in fig .",

    "we again note that the curves in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] correspond to different values of @xmath31 .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , models with gapless spectra of photons , like the one considered in this paper , are strongly constrained by low energy physics experiment @xcite and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "we are not going to use these constraints in what follows , since they can be evaded by giving a relatively small gap to the bulk vector bosons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for concrete example ) .",
    "second , interactions of the photon zero mode with bulk fields is potentially dangerous @xcite , since this mode is inhomogeneous in the extra dinmension @xmath57 .",
    "likewise , the interaction of the quasi - localized @xmath1-boson with bulk fields is potentially dangerous , so having @xmath112 gauge theory in the bulk may be problematic .",
    "we leave this issue for further analysis and proceed with our phenomenological study at the linearized level .",
    "within the rsii-@xmath0 model , the most promising process to search for at @xmath2 colliders is @xmath114 , see fig .",
